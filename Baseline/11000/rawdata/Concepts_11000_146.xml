'''Air rights''' are the property interest in the "space" above the earth's surface. Generally speaking, owning, or renting, land or a [[building]] includes the right to use and develop the space above the land without interference by others.

This legal concept is encoded in the Latin phrase ''[[Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos]]'' ("''Whoever owns the soil, it is theirs up to Heaven and down to Hell''."), which appears in [[medieval Roman law]] and is credited to 13th-century [[glossator]] [[Accursius]]; it was notably popularized in [[common law]] in ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' (1766) by [[William Blackstone]]; see [[Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos#Origins|origins of phrase]] for details.&lt;!-- See refs there --&gt;

== Air travel ==
&lt;!---knowledgeable people can add other countries here, but the first part is germane to all countries---&gt;
{{Further information|Flyover rights}}
Property rights defined by points on the ground were once believed to extend indefinitely upward. This notion remained unchallenged before [[air travel]] became popular in the early 20th century. To promote air transport, legislators established a legal right for the public to transit at high altitudes, regardless of real estate ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Paris Convention of 1919 (Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation, Oct. 13, 1919, 11 L.N.T.S. 173) and the Pan American Convention on Commercial Aviation, U.S.-Cuba, Feb. 20, 1928, see 47 Stat. 1901)&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the public easement in the space at these higher altitudes and landowner rights to the exclusive use of the airspace at lower altitudes have been well documented by the U.S. judiciary.

New technologies have again raised questions about ownership of "space" and the upward bounds of national sovereignty.  With the advent of space travel above earth's atmosphere, the height at which national sovereignty extends and therefore nations can regulate transit is often debated.

===United States===
[[File:Building cantilever New York.JPG|thumb|right|A building is cantilevered over two other buildings in [[New York City]]]]
In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) has the sole authority to control all "publicly owned" [[airspace]], exclusively determining the rules and requirements for its use.&lt;ref&gt;49 U.S.C. 180, 49 U.S.C.A. 18 , §&amp;nbsp;40103 "use of airspace"&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the Federal Aviation Act provides that: "The [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]] has exclusive sovereignty of airspace of the United States",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/40103- |title=49 U.S.C. 40103(a)(1) |accessdate=2009-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but not all the airspace is "possessed" by the United States.  For non-public airspace, Congress has provided authority for the FAA to purchase this non-public airspace near airports to accommodate planes taking off and landing.&lt;ref&gt;49 U.S.C §&amp;nbsp;40110&lt;/ref&gt;  The "navigable airspace" in which the public has a right of transit without affecting a landowner's property rights has been set at the height of 500&amp;nbsp;ft in urban or suburban areas,&lt;ref&gt;"Argent v. U.S. 124 F.3rd 1277,1281 (1997) citing Lacey v. United States, 219 Ct.Cl. 551, 595 F.2d 614, 616 (1979) (treating 500 feet as line of demarcation between compensatable property taking and non-compensatable overflights); Matson v. United States, 145 Ct.Cl. 225, 171 F.Supp. 283, 286 (1959) (providing compensation for flights under 500 feet).Aaron v. United States, 160 Ct.Cl. 295, 311 F.2d 798, 801 (1963) (allowing claims based on flights below 500ft, while denying those based on flights over 500ft).”&lt;/ref&gt; and 360 feet above the surface or tallest structure in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. v Causby 328 U.S. 256,264-266 (1946) and Causby v U.S. 75 F.262 Ct.Cl (1948)&lt;/ref&gt;   The exact altitude(s) at which the  airspace over private land becomes "public" airspace, or where the upward bounds of national sovereignty extends is often debated, but the Supreme Court rulings and space treaties are clear.  A landowner's domain extends up to at least 365 feet above the ground. see [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17209011020287234065 Causby v US (1946)],&lt;ref&gt;U.S. v Causby 328 U.S. 256,264-266 (1946) and Causby v U.S. 75 F.262 Ct.Cl (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; and no nation can prevent orbits above the Earth's atmosphere.

The FAA is required to pay financial compensation to property owners when their property interests are taken for overflights.   Compensated landowners may then be required to waive any putative damages for interference with "air rights" in order to avoid [[lawsuit]]s from future owners' nuisance claims against low flying aircraft.  This is called a navigation or navigational [[easement]].

The low cost of [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (also called drones) in the 2000s re-raised legal questions regarding whose permission is required to fly at low altitudes; the landowner, the FAA or both.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=317074394&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the FAA reestablished that navigable airspace is the space above 500 feet,&lt;ref&gt;Doc. No. 18334, 54 FR 34294, Aug. 18, 1989, as amended by Amdt. 91-311, 75 FR 5223, Feb. 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the FAA also set regulations which allow drones to fly below 400 feet in order to prevent interference with planes above that height.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-28/pdf/2016-15079.pdf F.R. 2016 6-28-2016 Pgs 42063- 42214 DOC #: 2016-15079]&lt;/ref&gt;  The FAA's actions are expected to see challenges in the judiciary.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

== Railroads and air rights ==
[[Rail transport|Railroads]] were the first companies to realize the potential of making money from their air rights. A good example of this is [[Grand Central Terminal]] in [[New York City]], where [[William J. Wilgus]], chief engineer of the [[New York Central Railroad|New York Central and Hudson River Railroad]], devised a plan to earn profit from air rights. At first, the railroad simply constructed a platform above the rail yards to allow for the development of buildings overhead. By 1954, the railroad began to realize it could sell more air rights and Grand Central Terminal was proposed to be replaced by a 50-story tower. This is how the [[MetLife Building|Pan Am Building]] came to be built next to the station, after public protest regarding the demolition of Grand Central Terminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gray |first=Christopher |title=Grand Central Terminal; The 23-Story, Beaux-Arts 1913 Tower That Wasn't |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 11, 1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/11/realestate/streetscapes-grand-central-terminal-23-story-beaux-arts-1913-tower-that-wasn-t.html |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has been used in Chicago since the construction of the [[One Prudential Plaza|Prudential Building]] in 1955 above active railroad tracks of the Illinois Central Railroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Dedicate New Prudential 41 Story Building |last=Fuller|first=Ernest |date=December 9, 1955 |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1955/12/09/page/13/article/dedicate-new-prudential-41-story-building |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, to the west of the Chicago River, [[River Point]] and [[150 North Riverside]] were built above tracks leading to the Amtrak station.

Building on platforms over railroad tracks is still potentially very profitable. In the mid-2000s, New York's [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA) attempted to sell air rights to the [[New York Jets]] so that they could build the [[West Side Stadium]] over Manhattan's [[West Side Yard]], near [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]], as part of the [[Hudson Yards Redevelopment]]. The [[Hudson Yards (development)|Hudson Yards mega-development]] was eventually built over the rail yard. In Brooklyn, the [[Barclays Center]] and [[Pacific Park, Brooklyn|Pacific Park]] have been constructed over Atlantic Yards.

== Roads and air rights ==
Similar to railroads, builders of [[highway]]s have proposed selling their air rights; [[Boston]] did this in connection with the [[Big Dig (Boston, Massachusetts)|Big Dig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCown |first=James |date=September 4, 2002 |title=Boston Air Rights |journal=Architecture Week |volume=113 |issue=4 |url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2002/0904/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Los Angeles|city of Los Angeles]] funded a $100,000 feasibility study [[RFP]] in January 2007 to explore building a freeway cap park in [[Hollywood]].  The park would be built above [[U.S. Route 101 in California|US highway 101]] and contain {{convert|24|acre|m2}} of new parkland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodfreewaycentralpark.org/ » Community-Wide Hollywood Central Park Meeting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Air rights in development ==
The owner of the land has the exclusive development rights in the 'space' above his lands. Under common law, building a 'hangover' that breaks the vertical plane of a neighbor's property is a trespass and the property owner has the right to remove the offending structure. The airspace is property and retains developmental rights which can be sold or transferred. Thus in a dense downtown area, each building in the area may have the right to thirty-five stories of airspace above his own property. The owners of an older building of only three stories high could make a great deal of money by selling their building and allowing a thirty-five-story skyscraper to be built in its place. For example, a skyscraper developer may purchase the unused airspace from an adjacent landowner in order to develop a broader building. In November 2005, Christ Church in New York sold its vertical development rights for a record $430 per square foot, making more than $30 million on the sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bagli |first=Charles V. |title=$430 a Square Foot, for Air?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31922">{{The Works of Aristotle}}[[Aristotle]] first used the term [[ethics]] to name a field of study developed by his predecessors [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]]. Philosophical ethics is the attempt to offer a rational response to the question of how humans should best live. Aristotle regarded ethics and [[politics]] as two related but separate fields of study, since ethics examines the good of the individual, while politics examines the good of the city-state.

Aristotle's writings have been read more or less continuously since ancient times,&lt;ref&gt;"Roman Aristotle," in ''Philosophia Togata II: Plato and Aristotle at Rome'', Oxford University Press (Oxford: 1997), pp. 1–69.&lt;/ref&gt;  and his ethical treatises in particular continue to influence philosophers working today. Aristotle emphasized the importance of developing excellence ([[virtue]]) of character (Greek ''ēthikē [[arete (moral virtue)|aretē]]''), as the way to achieve what is finally more important, excellent conduct (Greek ''[[energeia]]''). As Aristotle argues in Book II of the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', the man who possesses character excellence does the right thing, at the right time, and in the right way. Bravery, and the correct regulation of one's bodily appetites, are examples of character excellence or virtue. So acting bravely and acting temperately are examples of excellent activities. The highest aims are living well and ''[[eudaimonia]]'' a Greek word often translated as well-being, [[happiness]] or "human flourishing".&lt;ref&gt;''Nicomachean Ethics'', trans. T.H. Irwin, Introduction. Hackett Publishing Company (Indianapolis: 1999) ''xv''.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many ethicists, Aristotle regards excellent activity as pleasurable for the man of virtue. For example, Aristotle thinks that the man whose appetites are in the correct order actually takes pleasure in acting moderately.

Aristotle emphasized that virtue is practical, and that the purpose of ethics is to become good, not merely to know. Aristotle also claims that the right course of action depends upon the details of a particular situation, rather than being generated merely by applying a law. The type of wisdom which is required for this is called "prudence" or "practical wisdom" (Greek ''[[phronesis]]''), as opposed to the wisdom of a theoretical philosopher (Greek ''[[wikt:σοφία#Ancient Greek|sophia]]''). But despite the importance of practical decision making, in the final analysis the original Aristotelian and Socratic answer to the question of how best to live, at least for the best types of human, was to live the life of [[philosophy]].'

== Three ethical treatises ==

Three Aristotelian ethical works survive today which are considered to be either by Aristotle, or from relatively soon after:
* ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', abbreviated as the ''NE'' or sometimes (from the Latin version of the name) as the ''EN''. The ''NE'' is in 10 books, and is the most widely read of Aristotle's ethical treatises.
* ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]'', often abbreviated as the ''EE''.
* ''[[Magna Moralia]]'', often abbreviated as the ''MM''.

The exact origins of these texts is unclear, although they were already considered the works of Aristotle in ancient times. Textual oddities suggest that they may not have been put in their current form by Aristotle himself. For example, Books IV–VI of ''Eudemian Ethics'' also appear as Books V–VII of ''Nicomachean Ethics''. The authenticity of the ''Magna Moralia'' has been doubted,&lt;ref&gt;But for an argument that the Magna Moralia's philosophical content (if not the language) is authentically Aristotle's, see: John M. Cooper, "The Magna Moralia and Aristotle's Moral Philosophy," in ''The American Journal of Philology'' 94.4 (Winter, 1973): pp. 327–49.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas almost no modern scholar doubts that Aristotle wrote the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and the ''Eudemian Ethics'' himself, even if an editor also played some part in giving us those texts in their current forms.

The ''Nicomachean Ethics'' has received the most scholarly attention, and is the most easily available to modern readers in many different translations and editions. Some critics consider the ''Eudemian Ethics'' to be "less mature," while others, such as Kenny (1978),&lt;ref&gt;''The Aristotelian Ethics: A Study of the Relationship between the Eudemian and Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle,'' (Oxford 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; contend that the ''Eudemian Ethics'' is the more mature, and therefore later, work.

Traditionally it was believed that the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and the ''Eudemian Ethics'' were either edited by or dedicated to Aristotle's son and pupil [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]] and his disciple Eudemus, respectively, although the works themselves do not explain the source of their names.  Although Aristotle's father was also called Nicomachus, Aristotle's son was the next leader of Aristotle's school, the [[Lyceum]], and in ancient times he was already associated with this work.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero mentioned him in ''De Finibus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fourth treatise, Aristotle's [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']], is often regarded as the sequel to the Ethics, in part because Aristotle closes the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' by saying that his ethical inquiry has laid the groundwork for an inquiry into political questions (''NE'' X.1181b6-23). Aristotle's Ethics also states that the good of the individual is subordinate to the good of the city-state, or ''polis''.

Fragments also survive from Aristotle's [[Protrepticus (Aristotle)|''Protrepticus'']], another work which dealt with ethics.

== Aristotle as a Socratic ==

Some scholars regarded Aristotle as a Socratic thinker.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} Aristotle's ethics builds upon earlier Greek thought, particularly that of his teacher [[Plato]] and Plato's teacher, [[Socrates]]. While Socrates left no written works, and Plato wrote dialogues and a few letters, Aristotle wrote treatises in which he sets forth philosophical doctrines directly. To be more precise, Aristotle did write dialogues, but they unfortunately survive only in fragments.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

According to Aristotle in his ''Metaphysics'', Socrates was the first Greek philosopher to concentrate on ethics, although he apparently did not give it this name, as a philosophical inquiry concerning how people should best live. Aristotle dealt with this same question but giving it two names, "the political" (or Politics) and "the ethical" (Ethics), both with Politics being the name for the two together as the more important part. The original Socratic questioning on ethics started at least partly as a response to [[sophism]], which was a popular style of education and speech at the time. Sophism emphasized [[rhetoric]], and argument, and therefore often involved criticism of [[ancient Greek religion|traditional Greek religion]] and flirtation with [[moral relativism]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Aristotle's ethics, or study of character, is built around the premise that people should achieve an excellent character (a virtuous character, "''ethikē aretē''" in Greek) as a pre-condition for attaining happiness or well-being (''eudaimonia''). It is sometimes referred to in comparison to later ethical theories as a "character based ethics". Like Plato and Socrates he emphasized the importance of [[reason]] for human happiness, and that there were logical and natural reasons for humans to behave virtuously, and try to become virtuous.

Aristotle's treatment of the subject is distinct in several ways from that found in Plato's Socratic dialogues.

*Aristotle's presentation is obviously different from Plato's because he does not write in [[dialogue]]s, but in [[treatise]]s. Apart from this difference, Aristotle explicitly stated that his presentation was different from Plato's because he started from whatever could be agreed upon by well brought-up gentlemen, and not from any attempt to develop a general theory of what makes anything good. He explained that it was necessary not to aim at too much accuracy at the starting point of any discussion to do with controversial matters such as those concerning what is just or what is beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;NE Book I, EE Book I&lt;/ref&gt; (From this starting point however, he built up to similar theoretical conclusions concerning the importance of intellectual virtue and a contemplative life.)&lt;ref&gt;NE end of Book VI and end of Book X. Also see Burger (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rather than discussing only four "[[cardinal virtues]]" of Plato ([[courage]], [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], [[justice]], and [[prudence]]), all three of the ethical works start with courage and temperance as the two typical moral virtues which can be described as a mean, go on to discuss a whole range of minor virtues and vices which can be described as a mean, and only after that touch upon justice and the intellectual virtues. Aristotle places prudence (''phronēsis'', often translated as practical wisdom) amongst these intellectual virtues. (Nevertheless, like Plato he eventually says that all the highest forms of the moral virtues require each other, and all require intellectual virtue, and in effect that the happiest and most virtuous life is that of a philosopher.)&lt;ref&gt;Burger (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Aristotle emphasizes throughout all his analyses of virtues that they aim at what is beautiful (''kalos''), effectively equating [[The Good|the good]], at least for humans, with the beautiful (''to kalon'').&lt;ref&gt;Burger (2008); Sachs (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Aristotle's analysis of ethics makes use of his metaphysical theory of [[potentiality and actuality]]. He defines happiness in terms of this theory as an actuality (''energeia''); the virtues which allow happiness (and enjoyment of the best and most constant pleasures) are dynamic-but-stable dispositions (''hexeis'') which are developed through habituation; and this pleasure in turn is another actuality that compliments the actuality of happy living.&lt;ref&gt;NE Book X&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical ethics ==

[[Aristotle]] believed that ethical knowledge is not only a [[theory|theoretical]] knowledge, but rather that a person must have "experience of the actions in life" and have been "brought up in fine habits" to become good ([[Nicomachean Ethics|NE]] 1095a3 and b5). For a person to become virtuous, he can't simply study what virtue ''is'', but must actually do virtuous things.

{{cquote|We are not studying in order to know what virtue is, but to become good, for otherwise there would be no profit in it. ''(NE'' II.2)}}

== Aristotle's starting point ==

The Aristotelian Ethics all aim to begin with approximate but uncontroversial starting points. In the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' Aristotle says explicitly that one must begin with what is familiar to us, and "the that" or "the fact that" (''NE'' I.1095b2-13). Ancient commentators agree that what Aristotle means here is that his treatise must rely upon practical, everyday knowledge of virtuous actions as the starting points of his inquiry, and that he is supposing that his readers have some kind of experience-based understanding of such actions, and that they value noble and just actions to at least some degree.&lt;ref&gt;See M.F. Burnyeat, "Aristotle on Learning to be Good," in ''Essays on Aristotle's Ethics'', ed. Rorty (1980) pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere, Aristotle also seems to rely upon common conceptions of how the world works. In fact, some regard his ethical inquiries as using a method that relies upon popular opinion (his so-called "endoxic method" from the Grk. ''endoxa''). There is some dispute, however, about exactly how such common conceptions fit into Aristotle's method in his ethical treatises,&lt;ref&gt;Martha Nussbaum, for example, has argued that Aristotle's so-called endoxic method, described at ''NE'' VII.1145b1 ff. is in fact Aristotle's general philosophical method. See Nussbaum, ''Fragility of Goodness'' (Cambridge: 1986/2001) pp. 240 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly since he also makes use of more formal arguments, especially the so-called "function argument," which is described below.

Aristotle describes popular accounts about what kind of life would be a happy one by classifying them into three most common types: a life dedicated to vulgar pleasure; a life dedicated to fame and honor; and a life dedicated to contemplation (''NE'' I.1095b17-19). To reach his own conclusion about the best life, however, Aristotle tries to isolate the function of humans. The argument he develops here is accordingly widely known as "the function argument," and is among the most-discussed arguments made by any ancient philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;As noted by Rachel Barney, "Aristotle's Argument for a Human Function," in ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy'' 34 (Summer 2008) p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  He argues that while humans undergo nutrition and growth, so do other living things, and while humans are capable of perception, this is shared with animals (''NE'' I.1098b22-1098a15). Thus neither of these characteristics is particular to humans. According to Aristotle, what remains and what is distinctively human is reason. Thus he concludes that the human function is some kind of excellent exercise of the intellect. And, since Aristotle thinks that practical wisdom rules over the character excellences, exercising such excellences is one way to exercise reason and thus fulfill the human function.

One common objection to Aristotle's function argument is that it uses descriptive or factual premises to derive conclusions about what is good.&lt;ref&gt;As noted by Jennifer Whiting in an article that defends the argument. See Whiting, "Aristotle's Function Argument: A Defense" ''Ancient Philosophy'' 8, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Such arguments are often thought to run afoul of the [[is-ought problem|is-ought gap]].

== Moral virtue ==

Moral virtue, or excellence of character, is the disposition (Grk ''hexis'') to act excellently, which a person develops partly as a result of his upbringing, and partly as a result of his habit of action. Aristotle develops his analysis of character in Book II of the ''Nicomachean Ethics'', where he makes this argument that character arises from habit—likening ethical character to a skill that is acquired through practice, such as learning a musical instrument. In Book III of the ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Aristotle argues that a person's character is voluntary, since it results from many individual actions which are under his voluntary control.

Aristotle distinguishes the disposition to feel emotions of a certain kind from virtue and vice. But such emotional dispositions may also lie at a mean between two extremes, and these are also to some extent a result of up-bringing and habituation. Two examples of such dispositions would be modesty, or a tendency to feel shame, which Aristotle discusses in NE IV.9; and righteous indignation (''nemesis''), which is a balanced feeling of sympathetic pain concerning the undeserved pleasures and pains of others.&lt;ref&gt;EE III.vii. Also see MM.&lt;/ref&gt; Exactly which habitual dispositions are virtues or vices and which only concern emotions, differs between the different works which have survived, but the basic examples are consistent, as is the basis for distinguishing them in principle.

Some people, despite intending to do the right thing, cannot act according to their own choice. For example, someone may choose to refrain from eating chocolate cake, but finds himself eating the cake contrary to his own choice. Such a failure to act in a way that is consistent with one's own decision is called "''akrasia''", and may be translated as weakness of will, incontinence, or lack of self-mastery.

== Four Cardinal Virtues ==
# '''Prudence''', also known as practical wisdom, is the most important virtue for Aristotle. In war, soldiers must fight with prudence by making judgments through practical wisdom. This virtue is a must to obtain because courage requires judgments to be made.
# '''Temperance''', or self-control, simply means moderation. Soldiers must display moderation with their enjoyment while at war in the midst of violent activities. Temperance concerning courage gives one moderation in private which leads to moderation in public.
# '''Courage''' is “moderation or observance of the mean with respect to feelings of fear and confidence.”  Courage is “observance of the mean with regard to things that excite confidence or fear, under the circumstances which we have specified, and chooses its course and sticks to its post because it is noble to do so, or because it is disgraceful not to do so.”   Concerning warfare, Aristotle believes soldiers are morally significant and are military and political heroes. War is simply a stage for soldiers to display courage, and is the only way courage can be exemplified. Any other action by a human is simply the copying a soldier's ways; they are not actually courageous.
# '''Justice''' means giving the enemy what is due to them in the proper ways; being just toward them. In other words, one must recognize what is good for the community and one must undertake a good course of action.
Vices of courage must also be identified which are cowardice and recklessness. Soldiers who are not prudent act with cowardice, and soldiers who do not have temperance act with recklessness. One should not be unjust toward their enemy no matter the circumstance. On another note, one becomes virtuous by first imitating another who exemplifies such virtuous characteristics, practicing such ways in their daily lives, turning those ways into customs and habits by performing them each and every day, and finally, connecting or uniting the four of them together.

Only soldiers can exemplify such virtues because war demands soldiers to exercise disciplined and firm virtues, but war does everything in its power to shatter the virtues it demands. Since virtues are very fragile, they must be practiced always, for if they are not practiced they will weaken and eventually disappear. One who is virtuous has to avoid the enemies of virtue which are indifference or persuasion that something should not be done, self-indulgence or persuasion that something can wait and does not need to be done at that moment, and despair or persuasion that something simply cannot be accomplished anyway. In order for one to be virtuous they must display prudence, temperance, courage, and justice; moreover, they have to display all four of them and not just one or two to be virtuous.

== Justice ==

Aristotle devotes Book V of the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' to justice (this is also Book IV of the ''Eudemian Ethics''). In this discussion, Aristotle defines justice as having two different but related senses—general justice and particular justice. General justice is virtue expressed in relation to other people. Thus the just man in this sense deals properly and fairly with others, and expresses his virtue in his dealings with them—not lying or cheating or taking from others what is owed to them.
 
Particular justice is the correct distribution of [[just deserts]] to others. For Aristotle, such justice is proportional—it has to do with people receiving what is proportional to their merit or their worth. In his discussion of particular justice, Aristotle says an educated judge is needed to apply just decisions regarding any particular case. This is where we get the image of the scales of justice, the blindfolded judge symbolizing blind justice, balancing the scales, weighing all the evidence and deliberating each particular case individually.

== The highest good ==

In his ethical works, Aristotle describes ''eudaimonia'' as the highest human good. In Book I of the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' he goes on to identify ''eudaimonia'' as the excellent exercise of the intellect, leaving it open{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} whether he means practical activity or intellectual activity.
With respect to practical activity, in order to exercise any one of the practical excellences in the highest way, a person must possess all the others. Aristotle therefore describes several apparently different kinds of virtuous person as necessarily having all the moral virtues, excellences of character.
*Being of "great soul" ([[magnanimity]]), the virtue where someone would be truly deserving of the highest praise and have a correct attitude towards the honor this may involve. This is the first such case mentioned in the ''Nicomachean Ethics''.&lt;ref&gt;It is mentioned within the initial discussion of practical examples of virtues and vices at [[Nicomachean Ethics#Magnanimity or "greatness of soul"|Book IV]].[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1123b 1123b].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Being just in the true sense. This is the type of justice or fairness of a good ruler in a good community.&lt;ref&gt;This description occurs for example during the special discussion of the virtue (or virtues) of [[justice]] at [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1129b 1129b] in [[Nicomachean Ethics#Book V: Justice and Fairness: a moral virtue needing special discussion|Book V]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Phronesis]]'' or practical wisdom, as shown by good leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Mentioned in this way at 1144b in [[Nicomachean Ethics#Book VI: Intellectual virtue|Book VI]].[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1144b 1144b].&lt;/ref&gt;
*The virtue of being a truly good friend.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicomachean Ethics#Books VIII and IX: Friendship and partnership|Book VIII]].[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1157b 1157a]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Having the nobility ''[[kalokagathia]]'' of a gentleman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eudemian Ethics]] Book VIII, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle also says, for example in NE Book VI, that such a complete virtue requires intellectual virtue, not only practical virtue, but also theoretical wisdom. Such a virtuous person, if they can come into being, will choose the most pleasant and happy life of all, which is the philosophical life of contemplation and speculation.

Aristotle claims that a human's highest functioning must include reasoning, being good at what sets humans apart from everything else. Or, as Aristotle explains it, "The function of man is activity of soul in accordance with reason, or at least not without reason."  He identifies two different ways in which the soul can engage: ''reasoning'' (both practical and theoretical) and ''following reasoning''. A person that does this is the happiest because they are fulfilling their purpose or nature as found in the rational soul.

:(The wise person will) be more than human.  A man will not live like that by virtue of his humanness, but by virtue of some divine thing within him.  His activity is as superior to the activity of the other virtues as this divine thing is to his composite character.  Now if mind is divine in comparison with man, the life of the mind is divine in comparison with mere human life.  We should not follow popular advice and, being human, have only mortal thoughts, but should become immortal and do everything toward living the best in us. ''(NE 10.7)''

In other words, the thinker is not only the 'best' person, but is also most like God.

== Influence on later thinkers ==
{{see also|University of Magnaura}}

Aristotle's writings were taught in the Academy in Athens until 529 CE when the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian I]] closed down non-Christian schools of philosophy.

Aristotle's work however continued to be taught as a part of secular education. Aristotle's teachings spread through the Mediterranean and the Middle East, where some early Islamic regimes allowed rational philosophical descriptions of the natural world. [[Alfarabi]] was a major influence in all medieval philosophy and wrote many works which included attempts to reconcile the ethical and political writings of Plato and Aristotle. Later [[Avicenna]], and later still [[Averroes]], were [[Arabic Philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] who commented on Aristotle as well as writing their own philosophy in Arabic. Averroes, a European Muslim, was particularly influential in turn upon European Christian philosophers, theologians and political thinkers.

In the twelfth century, Latin translations of Aristotle's works were made, enabling the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priest [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]] and his pupil [[Thomas Aquinas]] to synthesize Aristotle's philosophy with Christian theology.  Later the medieval church [[scholasticism]] in Western Europe insisted on Thomist views and suppressed non-Aristotelian metaphysics. Aquinas' writings are full of references to Aristotle, and he wrote a commentary on Aristotle's ''Nicomachean Ethics''. Aquinas also departed from Aristotle in certain respects. In particular, his ''Summa Theologica'' argued that ''Eudaimonia'' or human flourishing was held to be a temporary goal for this life, but perfect happiness as the ultimate goal could only be attained in the next life by the virtuous. Aquinas also added new theological virtues to Aristotle's system: faith, hope and charity. And supernatural assistance could help people to achieve virtue. Nevertheless, much of Aristotle's ethical thought remained intact in Aquinas.

In modern times, Aristotle's writings on ethics remain among the most influential in his broad corpus, along with The Rhetoric, and The Poetics, while his scientific writings tend to be viewed as of more strictly historical interest. Modern science develops theories about the physical world based on experiments and careful observation—in particular, on the basis of exact measurements of time and distance. Aristotle, on the other hand, bases his science largely on qualitative and non-experimental observation. Accordingly, he made some inaccurate claims which have been overturned—such as the claim that objects of different mass accelerate at different rates due to gravity.

On the other hand, The ''Nicomachean Ethics'' continues to be relevant to philosophers today. In fact, [[virtue ethics]] takes its inspiration from Aristotle's approach to ethics—in particular, sharing his emphasis on character excellence, and ethical psychology. Some philosophers, in particular Bernard Williams, regard Aristotle's ethics as superior to the Utilitarian and Kantian traditions, which have come to be the dominant approaches to philosophical ethics. Aristotle's well-known function argument is less commonly accepted today, since he seems to use it in order to develop a claim about human perfection from an observation from what is distinctive about man. But the exact role of the function argument in Aristotle's ethical theory is itself a matter of dispute.

"Attitude" was arguably more important as an [[aesthetic]] term in the 19th century, when it was defined in one art-related dictionary as

&lt;blockquote&gt;the posture or disposition of the limbs and members of a figure, by which we discover the action in which it is engaged, and the very sentiment supposed to be in the mind of the person represented. It comprehends all the motions of the body, and requires a perfect knowledge of [[wikt:ponderation|ponderation]], and whatever refers to the [[center of gravity|centre of gravity]]; but whatsoever attitude be given to any figure, that attitude must show the beautiful parts, as much as the subject will permit, let the subject be what it will.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13666">An '''automated efficiency model (AEM)''' is a [[mathematical model]] that estimates a real estate property’s efficiency by using details specific to the property which are available publicly and/or housing characteristics which are aggregated over a given area such as a zip code. AEMs have some similarities to an [[automated valuation model]] (AVM) in terms of concept, advantages and disadvantages.

AEMs calculate specific efficiencies such as location, water, energy or solar efficiency. The Council of Multiple Listing Services defines an AEM as, “any algorithm or scoring model that estimates the [efficiency] of a home without an on-site inspection. They are similar to Automated Valuation Models (AVMs), but are more reliant on public data such as square footage...and estimated energy usage.&lt;ref name="CMLS Green Sheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=CMLS Green Sheet: Automated Efficiency Models|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/councilofmls.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/Files/CMLSGreenMLSSConAEMS1.pdf|website=Council of Multiple Listing Services|publisher=Council of Multiple Listing Services|accessdate=1 March 2017|date=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

Most AEMs calculate a property’s selected efficiency by analyzing available public information and may also apply proprietary data or formulas, and allow for a user such as a home owner to make additional inputs.  Housing characteristics such as age of the home or square footage may be obtained by data providers such as those on this [[list of online real estate databases]] or a similar offerings. Estimates of energy usage may be available from published sources such as through the Residential Energy Consumption Survey by the [[Energy Information Administration]].

== Examples of use ==
By design, the AEM score output is provided as a preliminary comparison tool so the score of one property may be compared to other homes, against an average score for the area, etc. Primary users may vary from buyers and sellers to real estate agents and appraisers as they complete relevant comparisons.  For example, REColorado, the multiple listing service covering the Denver metro area, presents a UtilityScore widget on homes for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McPherson|first1=Marian|title=UtilityScore comes to REcolorado.com|url=http://www.inman.com/2016/09/19/utilityscore-comes-to-recolorado/|accessdate=28 February 2017|publisher=Inman News|date=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zillow publishes a Sun Number score on the home fact sheet so website visitors can compare the solar energy potential of prospective properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sun Number Partnership with Zillow Brings Solar Potential Scores to Millions of Americans|url=https://energy.gov/eere/success-stories/articles/eere-success-story-sun-number-partnership-zillow-brings-solar|website=EERE Success Story|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=28 February 2017|date=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trulia has published a report using automated estimates from UtilityScore to present water, natural gas and electric rates into a single price per square foot by zip code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grant|first1=Kelli|title=Before you buy that home, avoid utility bill shock|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/26/before-you-buy-that-home-avoid-utility-bill-shock.html|accessdate=28 February 2017|publisher=CNBC|date=26 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond usage for consumer preliminary comparisons, usage of AEMs varies by industry.  AEMs may also be used by solar installers, home improvement contractors, efficiency inspectors, and mortgage lenders.

In the [[photovoltaics]] industry, installers use Sun Number to reduce the soft costs associated with motivating consumers to invest in solar systems and in recording property specifications to create quotes. The [[U.S. Department of Energy]] has found that Sun Number eliminates 7–10 days from the quotation process when solar suitability is determined digitally and eliminates the need for an onsite inspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herman|first1=David|title=New Blueprint for Rooftop Solar Analysis|url=http://solarbuildermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SB_SEPT_OCT_2013.pdf|accessdate=28 February 2017|publisher=Solar Builder Magazine|date=September–October 2013|pages=20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AEMs have been used in the mortgage industry to support a niche loan product called a [[Location Efficient Mortgage]] (LEM). During underwriting, an AEM such as the H+T Affordability Index is used to calculate the location efficient value&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Birdsell|first1=T.|last2=Dewar|first2=J.|last3=Sommers|first3=K.|last4=Zeidman|first4=M.|title=An Overview of Two Land Use Planning Tools Location Efficient Mortgages and Inclusionary Zoning|url=http://courses.washington.edu/udp501/501%20papers/Assign4_LEM+IZ.doc|website=Washington University|publisher=Washington University|accessdate=28 February 2017|archiveurl=http://dtpr.lib.athabascau.ca/action/download.php?filename=mais/700/suzannezemanProject.pdf|pages=2|format=Thesis|date=2012|archive-date=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to National Mortgage Professional Magazine AEMs may one day be incorporated into loan underwriting as well, “Since utilities are as big or bigger part of home expenses than even real estate taxes, we may see [estimated utility usage] begin to be factored into underwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Councilman|first1=J.|title=News from NAMP: October 20, 2016.

== Methodology ==
AEMs generate a score for a specific property based on both publicly available housing characteristics about the subject property as well as mathematical modeling. AEMs are technology-driven scores without an onsite inspection or human assessment. For more accurate information unique to a specific property an onsite inspection such as an [[energy audit]] is required.

Detailed information on the data accessed to calculate an AEM, the modeling formulas and algorithms are generally not published.  A summary of general information is listed in the table below:

== Advantages ==
As shown in the section above, AEMs tend to rely on public information rather than information which is private to the resident such as actual utility bills. Utility bills can vary based on the occupancy and [[personal property]] within a structure.  The public information used in AEMs is relatively static as it is focused on details of the structure, location and/or mechanical systems and therefore tends to reflect the [[real property]] transferred during a real estate transaction.

According to the Council of Multiple Listing Services advantages are, “AEMs provide consumers with a quick comparison of all properties across a specified market. Since most focus on the attached systems and structure, they are only meant to reflect the efficiency of the real property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CMLS Green Sheet: Automated Efficiency Models|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/councilofmls.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/Files/CMLSGreenMLSSConAEMS1.pdf|website=Council of Multiple Listing Services|publisher=Council of Multiple Listing Services|accessdate=1 March 2017|date=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

== Disadvantages ==
According to the Council of Multiple Listing Services advantages are, “AEMs are dependent on data used, the assumptions made, and the model methodology. Since models and methodologies differ and no on-site inspections are performed, accuracy may vary among scoring systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CMLS Green Sheet: Automated Efficiency Models|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/councilofmls.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/Files/CMLSGreenMLSSConAEMS1.pdf|website=Council of Multiple Listing Services|publisher=Council of Multiple Listing Services|accessdate=1 March 2017|date=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

'''Bhakti''' ({{lang-sa|[[:wikt:भक्ति#Sanskrit|भक्ति]]}}) literally means "attachment, participation, fondness for, homage, faith, love, devotion, worship, purity".&lt;ref name=monier&gt;See [[Monier-Williams]], ''Sanskrit Dictionary'', 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hinduism]], it refers to devotion to, and love for, a personal god or a representational god by a devotee.&lt;ref name=encyclopediabrit&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/63933/bhakti Bhakti], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=karen /&gt; In ancient texts such as the ''[[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]]'', the term simply means participation, devotion and love for any endeavor, while in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', it connotes one of the possible paths of spirituality and towards [[moksha]], as in ''bhakti marga''.&lt;ref&gt;John Lochtefeld (2014), ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism'', Rosen Publishing (New York), {{ISBN|978-0823922871}}, pages 98-100.

== Terminology ==
{{Hinduism small}}
The Sanskrit word ''bhakti'' is derived from the verb root ''bhaj-'', which means "to divide, to share, to partake, to participate, to belong to".&lt;ref name="Cutler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Prentiss"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pechilis Prentiss|first=Karen|title=The Embodiment of Bhakti|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=US|year=1999|page=24|isbn=978-0-19-512813-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vu95WgeUBfEC&amp;pg=PA24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Werner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Werner|first=Karel|title=Love Divine: studies in bhakti and devotional mysticism|publisher= Routledge|year= 1993|pages= 168|isbn= 978-0-7007-0235-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pYahlaJCLnYC&amp;pg=PA168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word also means "attachment, devotion to, fondness for, homage, faith or love, worship, piety to something as a spiritual, religious principle or means of salvation".&lt;ref name=monier /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=bhakti&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 bhakti] Sanskrit English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of the term ''Bhakti'' is analogous to but different from [[Kama]]. Kama connotes emotional connection, sometimes with sensual devotion and erotic love. Bhakti, in contrast, is spiritual, a love and devotion to religious concepts or principles, that engages both emotion and intellection.&lt;ref name=karen20&gt;Karen Pechelis (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 19-21&lt;/ref&gt; Karen Pechelis states that the word Bhakti should not be understood as uncritical emotion, but as committed engagement.&lt;ref name=karen20 /&gt; She adds that, in the concept of ''bhakti'' in Hinduism, the engagement involves a simultaneous tension between emotion  and intellection, "emotion to reaffirm the social context and temporal freedom, intellection to ground the experience in a thoughtful, conscious approach".&lt;ref name=karen20 /&gt; One who practices ''bhakti'' is called a ''bhakta''.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechelis (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The term bhakti, in [[Vedas|Vedic]] Sanskrit literature, has a general meaning of "mutual attachment, devotion, fondness for, devotion to" such as in human relationships, most often between beloved-lover, friend-friend, king-subject, parent-child.&lt;ref name="Cutler"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cutler|first=Norman|title=Songs of Experience|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1987|pages=1|isbn=978-0-253-35334-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=veSItWingx8C&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may refer to devotion towards a spiritual teacher ([[Guru]]) as ''guru-bhakti'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sivananda|first=Swami|title=Guru Bhakti Yoga|publisher=Divine Life Society|year=2004|isbn=81-7052-168-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vivekananda|first=Swami|title=The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|year=1970| url =http://www.dlshq.org/download/gurubhaktiyoga.htm | pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to a personal god,&lt;ref name="Cutler" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Neusner, Jacob|title=World religions in America: an introduction|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|year=2003|pages=128|isbn=0-664-22475-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for spirituality without form ([[nirguna]]).&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, page 21&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Sri Lankan Buddhist scholar Sanath Nanayakkara, there is no single term in English that adequately translates or represents the concept of ''bhakti'' in Indian religions.{{sfn| Nanayakkara|1966|pp=678–80}} Terms such as "devotion, faith, devotional faith" represent certain aspects of ''bhakti'', but it means much more. The concept includes a sense of deep affection, attachment, but not wish because "wish is selfish, affection is unselfish". Some scholars, states Nanayakkara, associate it with ''saddha'' (Sanskrit: ''Sraddha'') which means "faith, trust or confidence". However, ''bhakti'' can connote an end in itself, or a path to spiritual wisdom.{{sfn| Nanayakkara|1966|pp=678–80}}

The term ''Bhakti'' refers to one of several alternate spiritual paths to [[moksha]] (spiritual freedom, liberation, salvation) in Hinduism,&lt;ref name=johnmartin /&gt; and it is referred to as ''bhakti marga'' or ''bhakti yoga''.&lt;ref name="Klostermaier"&gt;{{cite book|last=Klostermaier|first=Klaus|authorlink=Klaus Klostermaier|title=A survey of Hinduism|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1989|pages=210–212|isbn=978-0-88706-807-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechelis (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 14-15, 37-38&lt;/ref&gt; The other paths are ''Jnana marga'' (path of knowledge), ''Karma marga'' (path of works), ''Rāja marga'' (path of contemplation and meditation).&lt;ref name=johnmartin&gt;John Martin Sahajananda (2014), Fully Human Fully Divine, Partridge India, {{ISBN|978-1482819557}}, page 60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;KN Tiwari (2009), Comparative Religion, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120802933}}, page 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''bhakti'' has been usually translated as "devotion" in [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 15-24&lt;/ref&gt; The colonial era authors variously described ''Bhakti'' as a form of mysticism or "primitive" religious devotion of lay people with monotheistic parallels.&lt;ref name=paulcarus&gt;Paul Carus, {{Google books|96sLAAAAIAAJ|The Monist|PA514}}, pages 514-515&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DG Mandelbaum (1966), Transcendental and Pragmatic Aspects of Religion, American Anthropologist, 68(5), pages 1174–1191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DC Scott (1980), Hindu and Christian Bhakti: A Common Human Response to the Sacred, Indian Journal of Theology, 29(1), pages 12-32&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern scholars state "devotion" is a misleading and incomplete translation of ''bhakti''.&lt;ref name=karen2324 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gale"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gale Encyclopedia of Religion|pages=856–857|editor=Lindsay Jones|publisher=Thompson Gale|year=2005|volume=Volume 2|isbn=0-02-865735-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many contemporary scholars have questioned this terminology, and most now trace the term ''bhakti'' as one of the several spiritual perspectives that emerged from reflections on the Vedic context and Hindu way of life. Bhakti in Indian religions is not a ritualistic devotion to a god or to religion, but participation in a path that includes behavior, ethics, mores and spirituality.&lt;ref name=karen2324 /&gt; It involves, among other things, refining one's state of mind, knowing god, participating in god, and internalizing god.&lt;ref name=karen2324 /&gt; Increasingly, instead of "devotion", the term "participation" is appearing in scholarly literature as a gloss for the term ''bhakti''.&lt;ref name=karen2324&gt;Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt;

=== The Upanishads ===
The last of three epilogue verses of the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]], dated to be from 1st millennium BCE, uses the word ''Bhakti'' as follows,

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
यस्य देवे परा '''भक्तिः''' यथा देवे तथा गुरौ &lt;nowiki&gt;।
तस्यैते कथिता ह्यर्थाः प्रकाशन्ते महात्मनः ॥ २३ ॥&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/श्वेताश्वतरोपनिषद् Shvetashvatara Upanishad 6.23] Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;

He who has highest ''Bhakti'' of ''Deva'' (God),
just like his ''Deva'', so for his ''Guru'' (teacher),
To him who is high-minded,
these teachings will be illuminating.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Shvetashvatara Upanishad 6.23&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, page 326&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads02ml#page/266/mode/2up Shvetashvatara Upanishad], The Upanishads, Part II, Oxford University Press, page 267&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This verse is one of the earliest use of the word ''Bhakti'' in ancient Indian literature, and has been translated as "the love of God".&lt;ref name=paulcarus /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WN Brown (1970), Man in the Universe: Some Continuities in Indian Thought, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520017498}}, pages 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars&lt;ref name=pauldeussenintro&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 301-304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maxmullerinto&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads02ml#page/n33/mode/2up The Shvetashvatara Upanishad], Oxford University Press, pages xxxii – xlii&lt;/ref&gt; have debated whether this phrase is authentic or later insertion into the Upanishad, and whether the terms "Bhakti" and "Deva" meant the same in this ancient text as they do in the modern era. [[Max Muller]] states that the word ''Bhakti'' appears only once in this Upanishad, that too in one last verse of the epilogue, could have been a later addition and may not be theistic as the word was later used in much later ''Sandilya Sutras''.&lt;ref name=maxmullerbhakti&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads02ml#page/n33/mode/2up The Shvetashvatara Upanishad], Oxford University Press, pages xxxiv and xxxvii&lt;/ref&gt; Grierson as well as Carus note that the first epilogue verse 6.21 of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad is also notable for its use of the word ''Deva Prasada'' (देवप्रसाद, grace or gift of God), but add that ''Deva'' in the epilogue of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad refers to "pantheistic [[Brahman]]" and the closing credit to sage Shvetashvatara in verse 6.21 can mean "gift or grace of his Soul".&lt;ref name=paulcarus /&gt;

Scholarly consensus sees ''bhakti'' as a post-Vedic movement that developed primarily during the Epics and Puranas era of Indian history.&lt;ref&gt;"Scholarly consensus today tends to view bhakti as a post-Vedic development that took place primarily in the watershed years of the epics and Puranas."

=== Bhakti movement ===
{{Main|Bhakti movement}}
The ''[[Bhakti Movement]]'' was a rapid growth of bhakti, first starting in the later part of 1st millennium CE, from [[Tamil Nadu]] in Southern India with the Saiva [[Nayanars]]&lt;ref name="Embree"&gt;{{cite book|last=Embree|first=Ainslie Thomas | authorlink=Ainslie Embree|author2=Stephen N. Hay |author3=William Theodore De Bary |title=Sources of Indian Tradition|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1988|pages=342|isbn=978-0-231-06651-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=An5mD6KMiSIC&amp;pg=PA342}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Vaisnava [[Alvars]]. Their ideas and practices inspired bhakti poetry and devotion throughout India over the 12th-18th century CE.&lt;ref name="Flood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Embree" /&gt; The Alvars ("those immersed in God") were Vaishnava poet-saints who wandered from temple to temple singing the praises of Vishnu. They established temple sites ([[Srirangam]] is one) and converted many people to [[Vaishnavism]].&lt;ref name="Embree" /&gt;

[[File:Meerabai (crop).jpg|thumb|left|[[Meera]] (1498-1546) was one of the most significant poet-saints in the [[Vaishnava]] bhakti movement.&lt;ref name=smpandey&gt;SM Pandey (1965), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1061803 Mīrābāī and Her Contributions to the Bhakti Movement], History of Religions, Vol. 5, No. 1, pages 54-73&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Like the Alvars the [[Shaivism|Saiva]] Nayanar poets were influential. The ''[[Tirumurai]]'', a compilation of hymns by sixty-three Nayanar poets, is still of great importance in South India. Hymns by three of the most prominent poets, [[Appar]] (7th century CE), [[Campantar]] (7th century) and [[Sundarar]] (9th century), were compiled into the ''[[Tevaram]]'', the first volumes of the ''Tirumurai''. The poets' itinerant lifestyle helped create temple and pilgrimage sites and spread devotion to Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Olson|first=Carl|title=The many colors of Hinduism: a thematic-historical introduction|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|year=2007|pages=231|isbn=978-0-8135-4068-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RVWKClYq4TUC&amp;pg=PA231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Tamil-Siva bhakti poets are quoted the [[Black Yajurveda]].&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 17-18&lt;/ref&gt; The Alwars and Nayanars were instrumental in propagating the Bhakti tradition. The [[Bhagavata Purana]]'s references to the South Indian Alvar saints, along with its emphasis on ''bhakti'', have led many scholars to give it South Indian origins, though some scholars question whether this evidence excludes the possibility that ''bhakti'' movement had parallel developments in other parts of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Sheridan| first=Daniel| title= The Advaitic Theism of the Bhagavata Purana |publisher=South Asia Books |location=Columbia, Mo |year=1986 |isbn=81-208-0179-2 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=qrtYYTjYFY8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=van Buitenen | first=J.

Scholars state that the ''bhakti'' movement focused on the gods Vishnu, Shiva, Shakti and other deities, that developed and spread in India, was in response to the arrival of [[Islam]] in India about 8th century CE,&lt;ref&gt;Note: The earliest arrival dates are contested by scholars. They range from 7th to 9th century, with Muslim traders settling in coastal regions of Indian peninsula, to Muslims seeking asylum in Tamil Nadu, to raids in northwest India by [[Muhammad bin Qasim]]. See: Annemarie Schimmel (1997), Islam in the Indian subcontinent, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004061170}}, pages 3-7; Andre Wink (2004), Al-Hind: the Making of the Indo-Islamic World, Brill Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|90-04-09249-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent [[Religious violence in India|religious violence]].&lt;ref name=encyclopediabrit /&gt;&lt;ref name=karen /&gt;&lt;ref name=johnhawley /&gt; This view is contested by other scholars.&lt;ref name=johnhawley&gt;John Stratton Hawley (2015), A Storm of Songs: India and the Idea of the Bhakti Movement, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674187467}}, pages 39-61&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bhakti movement swept over east and north India from the fifteenth-century onwards, reaching its zenith between the 15th and 17th century CE.&lt;ref name=schomer&gt;Karine Schomer and WH McLeod (1987), The Sants: Studies in a Devotional Tradition of India, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120802773}}, pages 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; Bhakti poetry and ideas influenced many aspects of Hindu culture, religious and secular, and became an integral part of Indian society.&lt;ref name="Embree" /&gt; It extended its influence to [[Sufism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flood|first=Gavin D.|title=The Blackwell companion to Hinduism|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|year=2003|page=185|isbn=978-0-631-21535-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qSfneQ0YYY8C&amp;pg=PA185}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity]],&lt;ref name="Neill 2002 412" /&gt; and [[Jainism]].&lt;ref name="Kelting 2001 87" /&gt; [[Sikhism]] was founded by [[Nanak]] in the 15th century, during the bhakti movement period, and scholars call it a Bhakti sect of Indian traditions.&lt;ref&gt;W.

The movement has traditionally been considered as an influential social reformation in Hinduism, and provided an individual-focused alternative path to spirituality regardless of one's birth caste or gender.&lt;ref name=schomer /&gt; [[Postmodernism|Postmodern]] scholars question this traditional view and whether the [[Bhakti movement]] were ever a social reform or rebellion of any kind.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 10-16&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest Bhakti movement was a revival, reworking and recontextualization of ancient Vedic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ramana Maharishi, states David Frawley, bhakti is a "surrender to the divine with one's heart". It can be practiced as an adjunct to self-inquiry, and in one of four ways:{{sfn|Frawley|2000|p=133}}
# Atma-Bhakti: devotion to the one's ''atma'' (Supreme Self)
# Ishvara-Bhakti: devotion to a formless being (God, Cosmic Lord)
# Ishta Devata-Bhakti: devotion to a personal god or goddess
# Guru-Bhakti: devotion to [[Guru]]

=== Bhagavata Purana and Navaratnamalika ===
The ''Navaratnamalika'' (garland of nine gems), nine forms of ''bhakti'' are listed: (1) ''śravaṇa'' (listening to ancient texts), (2) ''kīrtana'' (praying), (3) ''smaraṇa'' (remembering teachings in ancient texts), (4) ''pāda-sevana'' (service to the feet), (5) ''archana'' (worshiping), (6) ''namaskar'' or ''vandana'' (bowing to the divine), (7) ''dāsya'' (service to the divine), (8) ''sākhyatva'' (friendship with the divine), and (9) ''ātma-nivedana'' (self-surrender to the divine).&lt;ref&gt;Vijaya Moorthy (2001), Romance of the Raga, Abhinav, {{ISBN|978-8170173823}}, pages 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Koskoff (2013), The Concise Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415994040}}, pages 992-993&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Hinduism speaks of five different ''[[bhava#In bhakti traditions|bhāvas]]'' or "[[affective]] essences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spivak|first=Gayatri Chakravorty | authorlink=Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak|title=Other Asias|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|date=December 28, 2007|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, ''bhāvas'' are different attitudes that a devotee takes according to his individual temperament to express his devotion towards God in some form.&lt;ref name="Akhilananda_180" /&gt; The different ''bhāvas'' are:
# ''śānta'', placid love for  God;
# ''dāsya'', the attitude of a servant;
# ''sakhya'', the attitude of a friend;
# ''vātsalya'', the attitude of a mother towards her child;

=== Buddhism ===

&lt;!--"Buddhist devotion#Definition" links here --&gt;
Bhakti (called ''bhatti'' in [[Pali]] language) has been a common aspect of Buddhism, where offerings and group prayers are made to images such the images of the [[Buddha]] and the ''[[Bodhisattvas]]'',&lt;ref name="swearer9"&gt;Donald Swearer (2003), Buddhism in the Modern World: Adaptations of an Ancient Tradition (Editors: Heine and Prebish), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195146981}}, pages 9-25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechelis (2011), The Bloomsbury Companion to Hindu Studies (Editor: Jessica Frazier), Bloomsbury, {{ISBN|978-1472511515}}, pages 109-112&lt;/ref&gt; or to deities such as [[wrathful deities]].&lt;ref name="child138"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louise Child|title=Tantric Buddhism and Altered States of Consciousness: Durkheim, Emotional Energy and Visions of the Consort |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yYDeCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT138 |year=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-04677-6|pages=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karel Werner]] notes that Bhakti has been a significant practice in [[Theravada]] Buddhism, and states, "there can be no doubt that deep devotion or ''bhakti / bhatti'' does exist in Buddhism and that it had its beginnings in the earliest days".&lt;ref name="werner45"&gt;Karel Werner (1995), Love Divine: Studies in Bhakti and Devotional Mysticism, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700702350}}, pages 45-46&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sri Lankan scholar Indumathie Karunaratna, the meaning of ''bhatti'' changed throughout Buddhist history, however.&lt;ref name="ik435" /&gt; In [[early Buddhism]], such as in the text [[Theragatha|Theragāthā]],{{sfn|Nanayakkara|1966|p=678}} ''bhatti'' had the meaning of 'faithful adherence to the [Buddhist] religion', and was accompanied with knowledge. In later text tradition, however, the term developed the meaning of an advanced form of emotional devotion. Examples of the latter include the veneration of Buddha [[Amitabha]] and those in the ''[[Lotus Sutra|Saddharmapundrarika Sutra]]''.&lt;ref name="ik435"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor1-last=Malalasekera|editor1-first=Gunapala Piyasena|editor1-link= G. P. Malalasekera|first= Indumathie|last= Karunaratna|encyclopedia= Encyclopaedia of Buddhism|title= Devotion|date=2000|volume=IV|publisher=Government of Ceylon|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/283214333/Enceylopaedia-of-Buddhism-Vol-IV|pages=435–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/early%20buddhist%20theory%20of%20knowledge_jayatilleke.pdf|last1=Jayatilleke|first1=K.N.|authorlink1=K.N. Jayatilleke|title=Early Buddhist theory of knowledge|date=1963|publisher=[[George Allen &amp; Unwin]]|isbn=1-134-54287-9|p=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; This changed the meaning of Buddhist devotion to a more person-centered sense, similar to a theist sense used in Hindu scriptures. This sense of devotion was no longer connected with a belief in a religious system, and had little place for doubt, contradicting the early Buddhist concept of ''saddhā''. ''Saddhā'' did not exclude reasonable doubt on the spiritual path, and was a step in reaching the final aim of developing wisdom, not an end in itself.{{sfn| Nanayakkara|1966|p=679}}

In early Buddhism, states Sanath Nanayakkara, the concept of taking refuge to the Buddha had the meaning of taking the Buddha as an ideal to live by, rather than the later sense of self-surrender.&lt;!--p=680--&gt; But already in the [[atthakatha|Commentary]] to the [[Abhidhamma]] text ''[[Puggalapaññatti]]'', it is mentioned that the Buddhist devotee should develop his ''saddhā'' until it becomes ''bhaddi'', a sense not mentioned in earlier texts and probably influenced by the Hindu idea of ''bhakti''.&lt;!--p=679--&gt; There are instances where commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] mentions taking refuge in the Buddha in the sense of mere adoration, indicating a historical shift in meaning.&lt;!--Nanayakkara 680--&gt; Similar developments took place with regard to the term [[Puja (Buddhism)|''puja'' (honor)]] and the role of the Buddha image. In [[Mahāyāna Buddhism]], the doctrine of the [[trikāya]] (three bodies) and the devotion towards ''Bodhisattvas'' all indicating a shift of emphasis toward devotion as a central concept in later Buddhism.&lt;!--p=681--&gt;{{sfn| Nanayakkara|1966|pp=679–81}}

In later faith-oriented literature, such as the [[Avadana|Avadānas]], faith is given an important role in Buddhist doctrine. Nevertheless, faith (''śraddhā'') is discussed in different contexts than devotion (''bhakti''). ''Bhakti'' is often used disparagingly to describe acts of worship to deities, often seen as ineffective and improper for a Buddhist. Also, ''bhakti'' is clearly connected with a person as an object, whereas ''śraddhā'' is less connected with a person, and is more connected with truthfulness and truth. Śraddhā focuses on ideas such as the working of [[karma (Buddhism)|karma]] and [[merit transfer]].&lt;ref name="Rotman 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rotman|first1=Andy|title=Thus Have I Seen: Visualizing Faith in Early Indian Buddhism|date=2008|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-045117-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=a-0JCAAAQBAJ|chapter=Getting and Giving}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, affective devotion is an important part of Buddhist practice, not only in Mahāyāna Buddhism. According to Winston King, a scholar on Theravāda Buddhism in Myanmar, "warm, personalized, emotional" ''bhakti'' has been a part of the [[Burmese Buddhism|Burmese Buddhis]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t tradition apart from the monastic and lay intellectuals.&lt;ref name="King1964p173" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kLs3AAAAIAAJ|last1=Gokhale|first1=Balkrishna Govind|title=Bhakti in Early Buddhism|editor-last=Lele|editor-first=J|year=1981|encyclopedia=Tradition and modernity in Bhakti movements|volume=31|publisher=[[Brill (publisher)|Brill Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha is treasured by the everyday devout Buddhist, just like Catholics treasure Jesus. The orthodox teachers tend to restrain the devotion to the Buddha, but to the devout Buddhist populace, "a very deeply devotional quality" was and remains a part of the actual practice. This is observable, states King, in "multitudes of pagoda worshippers of the Buddha images" and the offerings they make before the image and nowhere else.&lt;ref name="King1964p173"&gt;{{cite book|author=Winston Lee King|title=A thousand lives away: Buddhism in contemporary Burma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5_dCAAAAIAAJ|year=1964|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=173–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the worship of the ''Bodhisattvas'' and various deities in Tibetan and other traditions of Buddhism, including the so-called wrathful deities.&lt;ref name="child138" /&gt;

=== Jainism ===
Bhakti has been a prevalent ancient practice in various Jaina sects, wherein learned [[Tirthankara]] (''Jina'') and human ''gurus'' have been venerated with offerings, songs and [[Aarti|Āratī]] prayers.&lt;ref name=johncort&gt;John Cort, Jains in the World : Religious Values and Ideology in India, Oxford University Press, ISBN, pages 64-68, 86-90, 100-112&lt;/ref&gt;

Jainism participated in the Bhakti school of medieval India, and has a rich tradition of bhakti literature (''stavan'') though these have been less studied than those of the Hindu tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Whitney Kelting|title=Singing to the Jinas: Jain Laywomen, Mandal Singing, and the Negotiations of Jain Devotion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=elcn1IEJ3CEC |year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803211-3|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Avasyaka sutra'' of Jains includes, among ethical duties for the devotee, the recitation of "hymns of praise to the Tirthankaras" as the second Obligatory Action. It explains this ''bhakti'' as one of the means to destroy negative karma. According to [[Paul Dundas]], such textual references to devotional activity suggests that ''bhakti'' was a necessary part of Jainism from an early period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas|title=The Jains|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ |year= 2003|publisher =Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-26605-5|pages= 170–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jeffery Long, along with its strong focus on ethics and ascetic practices, the religiosity in Jainism has had a strong tradition of ''bhakti'' or devotion just like their Hindu neighbors. The Jain community built ornate temples and prided in public devotion for its fordmakers, saints and teachers. ''Abhisekha'', festival prayers, community recitals and ''Murti puja'' (rituals before an image) are examples of integrated bhakti in Jain practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffery D Long|title=Jainism: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3gAAwAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85771-392-6|pages=111–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sherry Fohr|title=Jainism: A Guide for the Perplexed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HMXuBQAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4742-2755-1|pages=91–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lisa Owen|title=Carving Devotion in the Jain Caves at Ellora|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vHK2WE8xAzYC |year=2012|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-20629-9|pages=xii, 2, 12–13, 117–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{C. S. Peirce articles}}
On May 14, 1867, the 27-year-old [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], who eventually founded [[pragmatism]], presented a paper entitled "[[s:On a New List of Categories|On a New List of Categories]]" to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. Among other things, this paper outlined a theory of predication involving three universal '''categories''' that Peirce continued to apply in philosophy and elsewhere for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=Burch&gt;Burch, Robert (2001, 2010), "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/peirce/ Charles Sanders Peirce]", ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. See §9 "Triadism and the Universal Categories".&lt;/ref&gt;{{example needed}} In the categories one will discern, concentrated, the pattern which one finds formed by the three grades of clearness in "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]"  (1878 foundational paper for pragmatism), and in numerous other three-way distinctions in his work.

==The Categories==

In Aristotle's logic, [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]] are adjuncts to reasoning that are designed to resolve equivocations, ambiguities that make expressions or signs recalcitrant to being ruled by logic. Categories help the reasoner to render signs ready for the application of logical laws. An equivocation is a variation in meaning — a manifold of sign senses — such that, as Aristotle put it about names in the opening of ''[[Wikisource:Categories|Categories]]'' (1.1&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;1–12), "Things are said to be named ‘equivocally’ when, though they have a common name, the definition corresponding with the name differs for each". So Peirce's claim that three categories are sufficient amounts to an assertion that all manifolds of meaning can be unified in just three steps.

The following passage is critical to the understanding of Peirce's Categories:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I will now say a few words about what you have called Categories, but for which I prefer the designation Predicaments, and which you have explained as predicates of predicates.

That wonderful operation of [[hypostatic abstraction]] by which we seem to create ''entia rationis'' that are, nevertheless, sometimes real, furnishes us the means of turning predicates from being signs that we think or think ''through'', into being subjects thought of. We thus think of the thought-sign itself, making it the object of another thought-sign.

Thereupon, we can repeat the operation of hypostatic abstraction, and from these second intentions derive third intentions. Does this series proceed endlessly? I think not. What then are the characters of its different members?

My thoughts on this subject are not yet harvested. I will only say that the subject concerns Logic, but that the divisions so obtained must not be confounded with the different Modes of Being: Actuality, Possibility, Destiny (or Freedom from Destiny).

On the contrary, the succession of Predicates of Predicates is different in the different Modes of Being. Meantime, it will be proper that in our system of diagrammatization we should provide for the division, whenever needed, of each of our three Universes of modes of reality into Realms for the different Predicaments. (Peirce 1906&lt;ref&gt;p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA523&amp;#PRA3-PA522,M1 522], "Prolegomena to an Apology for Pragmaticism", The ''Monist'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA523&amp;#PRA3-PA473,M1 vol. XVI, no. 4], Oct. 1906, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA523&amp;#PRA3-PA492,M1 492]–546, reprinted in the ''Collected Papers'' vol 4, paragraphs 530–572, see [http://www.existentialgraphs.com/peirceoneg/prolegomena.htm#Paragraph549 paragraph 549]&lt;/ref&gt;).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first thing to extract from this passage is the fact that Peirce's Categories, or "Predicaments", are predicates of predicates. Meaningful predicates have both ''[[Extension (semantics)|extension]]'' and ''[[intension]]'', so predicates of predicates get their meanings from at least two sources of information, namely, the classes of relations and the qualities of qualities to which they refer. Considerations like these tend to generate hierarchies of subject matters, extending through what is traditionally called the ''logic of second intentions'',&lt;ref&gt;Such "intentions" are more like [[intension]]s than like aims or purposings.&lt;/ref&gt; or what is handled very roughly by ''[[second order logic]]'' in contemporary parlance, and continuing onward through higher intensions, or ''[[higher order logic]]'' and ''[[type theory]]''.

Peirce arrived at his own system of three categories after a thoroughgoing study of his predecessors, with special reference to the categories of Aristotle, Kant, and Hegel. The names that he used for his own categories varied with context and occasion, but ranged from reasonably intuitive terms like ''quality'', ''reaction'', and ''representation'' to maximally abstract terms like ''firstness'', ''secondness'', and ''thirdness'', respectively. Taken in full generality, ''nth''-ness can be understood as referring to those properties that all ''n''-adic relations have in common. Peirce's distinctive claim is that a type hierarchy of three levels is generative of all that we need in logic.

Part of the justification for Peirce's claim that three categories are both necessary and sufficient appears to arise from mathematical ideas about the [[Relation reduction|reducibility]] of ''n''-adic relations. According to Peirce's Reduction Thesis,&lt;ref&gt;See "The Logic of Relatives," The ''Monist'', Vol. 7, 1897, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pa0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA554&amp;#PPA161,M1 161]-217, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=pa0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA554&amp;#PPA183,M1 p. 183] (via Google Books with registration apparently not required). Reprinted in the ''Collected Papers'', vol. 3, paragraphs 456-552, see paragraph 483.&lt;/ref&gt; (a) triads are necessary because genuinely triadic relations cannot be completely analyzed in terms of monadic and dyadic predicates, and (b) triads are sufficient because there are no genuinely tetradic or larger polyadic relations—all higher-[[arity]] ''n''-adic relations can be analyzed in terms of triadic and lower-arity relations. Others, notably Robert Burch (1991) and Joachim Hereth Correia and Reinhard Pöschel (2006), have offered proofs of the Reduction Thesis.&lt;ref&gt;* Burch, Robert (1991), ''A Peircean Reduction Thesis: The Foundations of Topological Logic'', Texas Tech University Press, Lubbock, TX

There have been proposals by Donald Mertz, Herbert Schneider, Carl Hausman, and Carl Vaught to augment Peirce's threefolds to fourfolds; and one by Douglas Greenlee to reduce them to twofolds.&lt;ref&gt;For references and discussion, see Burgess, Paul (circa 1988) "Why Triadic?: Challenges to the Structure of Peirce's Semiotic"; posted by [[Joseph Morton Ransdell|Joseph M.

Peirce introduces his Categories and their theory in [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/newlist/nl-frame.htm "On a New List of Categories" (1867)], a work which is cast as a Kantian deduction and is short but dense and difficult to summarize. The following table is compiled from that and later works.
{{C. S. Peirce categorial table}}
(The context for interpretants is not psychology or sociology, but instead philosophical logic. In a sense, an interpretant is whatever can be understood as a conclusion of an inference. The context for the categories as categories is phenomenology, which Peirce also called phaneroscopy and categorics.)

The practice of '''charity''' means the voluntary giving of help to those in need, as a [[humanitarian]] act.

== Etymology ==
The word ''charity'' originated in late [[Old English]] to mean a "[[Christian]] love of one's fellows,"&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Oxford Dictionary of English |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=293 |date=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=anecAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA293}}&lt;/ref&gt; and up until at least the beginning of the [[20th century]], this meaning remained synonymous with ''charity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The concise Oxford dictionary of current English |date=1912 |pages=137–138 |url=https://archive.org/stream/conciseoxforddic00fowlrich#page/136/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Charity, or Christian Love. A sermon, etc |date=1837 |last=Crisp |first=Thomas Steffe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D7fOBKf1YPEC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Christian love : or charity an essential element of true Christian character |date=1850 |last=Wise |first=Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Wise (author) |url=https://archive.org/details/christianloveorc00wise}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Charity and Its Fruits: Or, Christian Love as Manifested in the Heart and Life |date=1852 |orig-year=1738 |last=Edwards |first=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Edwards (theologian) |url=https://archive.org/details/christianloveorc00wise}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from this original meaning, ''charity'' is etymologically linked to Christianity, with the word originally entering into the [[English language]] through the [[Old French]] word "''charité''", which was derived from the [[Latin]] "''caritas''", a word commonly used in the [[Vulgate]] [[New Testament]] to translate the Greek word ''[[agape]]'' ({{linktext|ἀγάπη}}), a distinct form of "''[[Love (religious views)#Christian|love]]''"&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/charity |date=2018 |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |title=Charity origin and meaning |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see the article: [[Charity (virtue)]]).

Over time, the meaning of ''charity'' has shifted from one of "Christian love" to that of "providing for those in need; generosity and giving,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of Charity |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/charity |publisher=Merriam-Webster |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford" /&gt; a transition which began with the Old French word ''charité''.&lt;ref name="etymonline"/&gt; Thus, while the older [[Douay-Rheims Bible|Douay-Rheims]] and [[King James Version|King James]] versions of the [[Bible]] translate instances of "''agape''" (such as those that appear in [[1 Corinthians 13]]) as "''charity''", modern English versions of the Bible typically translate "''agape''" as  "''love.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-1.htm |title=1 Corinthians 13:1 |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charitable giving is the act of giving money, goods or time to the unfortunate, either directly or by means of a [[charitable trust]] or other worthy cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marquis|first=Christopher|last2=Tilcsik|first2=András|date=2016-10-01|title=Institutional Equivalence: How Industry and Community Peers Influence Corporate Philanthropy|url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/orsc.2016.1083|journal=Organization Science|volume=27|issue=5|pages=1325–1341|doi=10.1287/orsc.2016.1083|issn=1047-7039}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Charitable giving as a religious act or duty is referred to as almsgiving or alms. The name stems from the most obvious expression of the [[virtue]] of charity; giving the recipients of it the means they need to survive. The impoverished, particularly those widowed or orphaned, and the ailing or injured, are generally regarded as the proper recipients of charity. The people who cannot support themselves and lack outside means of support sometimes become "[[Begging|beggars]]", directly soliciting aid from strangers encountered in public.

Some groups regard charity as being distributed towards other members from within their particular group. Although giving to those nearly connected to oneself is sometimes called charity—as in the saying "Charity begins at home"—normally charity denotes giving to those not related, with [[filial piety]] and like terms for supporting one's family and friends.  Indeed, treating those related to the giver as if they were strangers in need of charity has led to the figure of speech "as cold as charity"—providing for one's relatives as if they were strangers, without affection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunn|first=Alison|title=As 'cold as charity'?:* poverty, equity and the charitable trust|journal=Legal Studies|volume=20|issue=2|pages=222–240|doi=10.1111/j.1748-121X.2000.tb00141.x|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most forms of charity are concerned with providing basic necessities such as food, water, clothing, healthcare and shelter, but other actions may be performed as charity:  visiting the imprisoned or the homebound, ransoming captives, educating orphans, even social movements. Donations to causes that benefit the unfortunate indirectly, such as donations to fund cancer research, are also charity.

With regards to religious aspects, the recipient of charity may offer to pray for the benefactor. In medieval Europe, it was customary to feast the poor at the funeral in return for their prayers for the deceased.  Institutions may commemorate benefactors by displaying their names, up to naming buildings or even the institution itself after the benefactors.  If the recipient makes material return of more than a token value, the transaction is normally not called charity.

In the past{{which|date=March 2016}} century, many [[charitable organization]]s have created a "charitable model" in which donators give to conglomerates give to recipients. Examples of this include the [[Make-A-Wish Foundation|Make a Wish Foundation]] (John Cena holds the title for most wishes granted by a single individual, with over 450 wishes) and the [[World Wildlife Fund]]. Today some charities have modernized, and allow people to donate online, through websites such as [[JustGiving]]. Originally charity entailed the benefactor directly giving the goods to the receiver.  This practice was continued by some individuals, for example, "[[CNN Heroes|CNN Hero]]" [[Sal Dimiceli]], and service organizations, such as the [[Jaycees]]. With the rise of more [[social peer-to-peer processes]], many charities are moving away from the charitable model and starting to adopt this more direct donator to recipient approach. Examples of this include [[Global Giving]] (direct funding of community development projects in developing countries), [[DonorsChoose]] (for US-based projects), [http://purecharity.org/ PureCharity], [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]] (funding loans administered by microfinance organizations in developing countries) and [[Zidisha]] (funding individual microfinance borrowers directly).

Institutions evolved to carry out the labor of assisting the poor, and these institutions, called [[Charitable organization|charities]], provide the bulk of charitable giving today, in terms of monetary value.  These include [[orphanage]]s, [[food bank]]s, [[religious institute]]s dedicated to care of the poor, [[hospital]]s, organizations that visit the homebound and imprisoned, and many others.  Such institutions allow those whose time or inclination does not lend themselves to directly care for the poor to enable others to do so, both by providing money for the work and supporting them while they do the work.  Institutions can also attempt to more effectively sort out the actually needy from those who fraudulently claim charity.  Early Christians particularly recommended the care of the unfortunate to the charge of the local bishop.

There have been examinations of who gives more to charity.  One study conducted in the United States found that as a percentage of income, charitable giving increased as income decreased.  The poorest fifth of Americans, for example, gave away 4.3% of their income, while the wealthiest fifth gave away 2.1%.  In absolute terms, this was an average of $453 on an average income of $10,531, compared to $3,326 on an income of $158,388.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2009253657_charity23.html "America's poor are its most generous donors"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527080829/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2009253657_charity23.html |date=May 27, 2009 }}, by Frank Greve, McClatchy Newspapers as appears in the ''Seattle Times'', published May 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
Critics of charitable giving contend that simply transferring gifts or money to disadvantaged people has negative long-term effects.  The online microlending organization [[Zidisha]] published a blog post which contended that providing handouts can actually cause harm by incentivizing lack of progress out of poverty, and by creating a dependence mentality among recipients.  According to Zidisha, microfinance lending is a better alternative than donations, because it incentivizes successful investment of the funds and creates a can-do mentality on the part of recipients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julia-kurnia/about-to-send-a-donation_b_4623503.html|title = About to send a donation? Think twice. |date = January 18, 2014|publisher = Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A philosophical critique of charity can be found in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Soul of Man]]'', where he calls it "a ridiculously inadequate mode of partial restitution . . . usually accompanied by some impertinent attempt on the part of the sentimentalist to tyrannise over [the poor's] private lives", as well as a remedy that prolongs the "disease" of poverty, rather than curing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Oscar Wilde |title=The Soul of Man under Socialism |year=1891 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wilde's thoughts are cited with approval by [[Slavoj Žižek]], and the Slovenian thinker adds his description of the effect of charity on the charitable:

{{quote|
When, confronted with the starving child, we are told: "For the price of a couple of cappuccinos, you can save her life!", the true message is: "For the price of a couple of cappuccinos, you can continue in your ignorant and pleasurable life, not only not feeling any guilt, but even feeling good for having participated in the struggle against suffering!"
|{{cite book |author=Slavoj Žižek |title=[[Living in the End Times]] |publisher=Verso |year=2010 |page=117}}}}

[[Friedrich Engels]], in his [[The Condition of the Working Class in England|1845 treatise]] on the condition of the working class in [[England]], points out that charitable giving, whether by governments or individuals, is often seen by the givers as a means to conceal suffering that is unpleasant to see. Engels quotes from a letter to the editor of an English newspaper who complains that

::streets are haunted by swarms of beggars, who try to awaken the pity of the passers-by in a most shameless and annoying manner, by exposing their tattered clothing, sickly aspect, and disgusting wounds and deformities. I should think that when one not only pays the poor-rate, but also contributes largely to the charitable institutions, one had done enough to earn a right to be spared such disagreeable and impertinent molestations.

The English bourgeoisie, Engels concludes,

::is charitable out of self-interest; it gives nothing outright, but regards its gifts as a business matter, makes a bargain with the poor, saying: "If I spend this much upon benevolent institutions, I thereby purchase the right not to be troubled any further, and you are bound thereby to stay in your dusky holes and not to irritate my tender nerves by exposing your misery. You shall despair as before, but you shall despair unseen, this I require, this I purchase with my subscription of twenty pounds for the infirmary!" It is infamous, this charity of a Christian bourgeois!&lt;ref&gt;''The Condition of the Working Class in England'' (1845), Penguin edition (1987), p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Institute of Economic Affairs]] published a report in 2012 called "Sock Puppets: How the government lobbies itself and why", which criticised the phenomenon of governments funding charities which then lobby the government for changes which the government wanted all along.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iea.org.uk/publications/research/sock-puppets-how-the-government-lobbies-itself-and-why/|title=Sock Puppets: How the government lobbies itself and why|author=|date=|website=Institute of Economic Affairs|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charity in Christianity ==
In medieval Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries, Latin [[Christendom]] underwent a charitable revolution.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Brodman, ''Charity and Religion in Medieval Europe'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  Rich patrons founded many leprosaria and hospitals for the sick and poor. New [[confraternities]] and religious orders emerged with the primary mission of engaging in intensive charitable work. Historians debate the causes. Some argue that this movement was spurred by economic and material forces, as well as a burgeoning urban culture. Other scholars argue that developments in spirituality and devotional culture were central. For still other scholars, medieval charity was primarily a way to elevate one's social status and affirm existing hierarchies of power.&lt;ref&gt;Adam J. Davis, "The Social and Religious Meanings of Charity in Medieval Europe" ''History Compass'' (2014) 12#12 pp 935–950&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tzedakah in Judaism ==
[[File:Jewish cemetery Otwock Karczew Anielin IMGP6721.jpg|thumb|Sandstone vestige of a Jewish gravestone depicting a [[Tzedakah]] box (pushke). [[Jewish cemetery]] in [[Otwock]] (Karczew-Anielin), Poland.]]
In [[Judaism]], ''[[tzedakah]]''—a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term literally meaning righteousness but commonly used to signify ''charity''&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Hayim Halevy Donin; "To Be A Jew". Basic Books, New York; 1972, pp. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;—refers to the religious obligation to do what is right and just.&lt;ref name="chabad"&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1079/jewish/The-Myth-of-Charity.htm; Tzedakah vs The Myth of Charity]; by [[Yanki Tauber]]; Retrieved 03-11-2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is commanded by the [[Torah]] and not voluntary, the practice is not technically an act of charity; such a concept is virtually nonexistent in Jewish tradition. Jews give tzedakah, which can take the form of money, time and resources to the needy, out of "righteousness" and "justice" rather than benevolence, generosity, or charitableness.&lt;ref name="chabad" /&gt; The [[Torah]] requires that 10 percent of a Jew's income be allotted to righteous deeds or causes, regardless if the receiving party is rich or poor.

== Zakat and Sadaqa in Islam ==
In [[Islam]] there are two methods of charity.

One called [[Zakat]], the other is called [[Sadaqah|Sadaqa]].

Zakat is one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam|five pillars]] upon which the Muslim religion is based, where 2.5% of one's saving is compulsory to be given as Zakat per Islamic calendar year, provided that the saving is beyond the threshold limit, called [[Nisab]], usually determined by the religious authority.

Sadaqa is voluntary charity or contribution. Sadaqa can be given using money, personal items, time or other resources. There is no minimum or maximum requirement for Sadaqa. Even smiling to other people is considered a Sadaqa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fortyessentialhadith.wordpress.com/2011/05/09/hadith-31-your-smile-to-your-brother-is-sadaqa/|title=Hadith 31: Your Smile to Your Brother is a Sadaqah|date=2011-05-09|website=Forty Essential Hadith|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dāna in Indian religions ==
The practice of charity is called ''[[Dāna]]'' or ''Daana'' in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. It is the virtue of generosity or giving.&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole (1991), Moral Issues in Six Religions, Heinemann, {{ISBN|978-0-435-30299-3}}, pages 104–105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=krma365&gt;Krishnan &amp; Manoj (2008), Giving as a theme in the Indian psychology of values, in Handbook of Indian Psychology (Editors: Rao et al.), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-8175966024}}, pages 365–366.&lt;/ref&gt; Dāna has been defined in traditional texts, state Krishnan and Manoj,&lt;ref name=kandm3&gt;Krishnan &amp; Manoj (2008), Giving as a theme in the Indian psychology of values, in Handbook of Indian Psychology (Editors: Rao et al.), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-8175966024}}, pages 361–382; [http://drsirswal.webs.com/documents/Indian%20Psychology%20of%20values.pdf summary of the article]&lt;/ref&gt; as “any action of relinquishing the ownership of what one considered or identified as one's own, and investing the same in a recipient without expecting anything in return”. [[Karna]], [[Mahabali]] and [[Harishchandra]] are heroes also known for giving charity.

The earliest known discussion of charity as a virtuous practice, in Indian texts, is in [[Rigveda]].&lt;ref name=rthg&gt;[[s:The Rig Veda/Mandala 10/Hymn 117|The Rig Veda]], Mandala 10, Hymn 117, [[Ralph T. H. Griffith]] (Translator)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rhdana&gt;R Hindery, Comparative ethics in Hindu and Buddhist traditions, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Vol 2, Number 1, page 105.&lt;/ref&gt; According to other ancient texts of Hinduism, dāna can take the form of feeding or giving to an individual in distress or need.&lt;ref name=ganguli311&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/mahabharataofkri08royp#page/310/mode/2up Anushasana Parva, Section LIX] The Mahabharata, Translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, pages 310–311.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also take the form of philanthropic public projects that empower and help many.&lt;ref name=ganguli&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/mahabharataofkri08royp#page/306/mode/2up Anushasana Parva, Section LVIII] The Mahabharata, Translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, Published by P.C.

Dāna leads to one of the [[paramita|perfections]] (''pāramitā''). This can be characterized by unattached and unconditional generosity, giving and letting go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tsong-kha-pa |authorlink=Je Tsongkhapa |editor=Joshua Cutler |editor2=Guy Newland |others= |title= The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment, Volume II |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2002|publisher= Snow Lion |location= Canada |language= |isbn= 1-55939-168-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}: 236, 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical records, such as those by the Persian historian Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī who visited India in early 11th century, suggest ''dāna'' has been an ancient and medieval era practice among Indian religions.&lt;ref name=birunihind&gt;Alberuni's India (v. 2), [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_002/pages/ldpd_5949073_002_00000157.html?toggle=image&amp;menu=maximize&amp;top=&amp;left= Chapter LXVII, On Alms and how a man must spend what he earns], Columbia University Libraries, London :  Kegan Paul, Trübner &amp; Co., (1910), pages 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maria Heim (2004), Theories of the Gift in Medieval South Asia: Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-521-60513-7}}, pages 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Defence Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|300px|right|deFENCE project. Click to enlarge]]

''''deFENCE'''' is an [[interactive]] [[conceptual art]] project for freedom of cohabitation, designed in such a way as to include each beholder personally. In tradition of [[Marcel Duchamp]], the ''two main roles'' of this exhibit are the work itself, and the person watching it. Only here, the subjective role of the beholder is not the only one. They are personally drawn into the exhibit, by way of a [[mirror]]. &lt;br /&gt;
The work represents a house, with its door wide open, inviting and welcoming every visitor. Except, a certain visitor is watching this house over a barbed wire fence. On the other hand, this visitor is being watched from the window of the house. The author's intention was to combine these two persons into one, so that people who had never had the chance to be on the other side of the barbed wire, can benefit in two ways: Firstly, they can see how it is to be looking over a barbed wire into a house inviting you, which you cannot reach. And secondly, they can see themselves passively looking from the house at the person outside the fence, doing nothing to remove this segregation.

The concept of this project is to bring to the attention of people living in the 'free' world that many of the boundaries that segregate others in a 'non free' world, are created by themselves. Or, at least, they do nothing to remove these boundaries.&lt;br /&gt;
The wish of the author is to help remove all boundaries that separate people and worlds.

''Note:'' 'deFENCE' project was created by Gregor Marković from [[Serbia]], in January 2006. It has been selected to take part at the International Design Biennial in St. Etienne, in 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5706">The '''differential outcomes effect''' is a [[theory]] in [[behaviorism]], a branch of [[psychology]], that shows that a positive effect on [[accuracy]] occurs in [[discrimination learning]] between different [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] when unique rewards are paired with each individual stimulus.  The DOE was first demonstrated in 1970 by Milton Trapold on an experiment with [[rats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trapold|first=Milton A.|date=1970-05|title=Are expectancies based upon different positive reinforcing events discriminably different?|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1016/0023-9690(70)90079-2|journal=Learning and Motivation|volume=1|issue=2|pages=129–140|doi=10.1016/0023-9690(70)90079-2|issn=0023-9690}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rats were trained to discriminate between a clicker and a tone by pressing the left and right levers.  Half of the rats were trained using the differential outcomes procedure, where the clicker was paired with sucrose and tone with food pellets.  The remaining rats were trained with only sucrose or only food pellets.  The rats trained with the differential outcomes procedure were significantly more accurate than those trained with only one type of reinforcement (common outcome).  Since then it has been established through a myriad of [[experiments]] that the Differential Outcome Effect exists in most [[species]] capable of [[learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Urcuioli|first=Peter J.|date=2005-2|title=Behavioral and associative effects of differential outcomes in discrimination learning|journal=Learning &amp; Behavior|volume=33|issue=1|pages=1–21|issn=1543-4494|pmid=15971490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The Differential Outcomes Effect not only states that an [[association (psychology)|association]] between a stimulus and a [[Stimulus (psychology)|response]] is formed as [[traditional]] [[Classical Conditioning]] states, but that a [[simultaneous]] association is formed between a stimulus and a [[reinforcer]] in the [[Human subject research|subject]]. If one were to pair a stimulus with a reinforcer, that is known as a differential condition. When this is employed, one can expect a higher accuracy in tests when discriminating between two stimuli, due to this increased amount of [[information]] available to the subject than in a nondifferential condition.

==History==
In 1970 the Differential Outcome Effect was discovered by Trapold when testing the reasoning behind the theory. He created an experiment where rats were taught to discriminate between a clicking noise and a tone. He associated the left bar with the clicking noise and the right bar with the [[Musical tone|tone]]. The experimental group was given [[sucrose]] for one response and [[food]] for the other. The control group was randomly given either food or sucrose for each response. The rats in the [[experimental group]] were able to [[discriminate]] between the two stimuli faster than the rats in the [[control group]].

The Differential Outcome Effect was then found to exist in various species including but not limited to [[rats]], [[pigeons]] and [[horses]], over the years and was then finally explored in [[humans]] by Pauline Maki, J. Bruce Overmier, Sandra Delos, and Arlyne Gutmann in 1995. They tested [[children]] who were from 4 to 7 years old to discriminate between two different [[shapes]]. Children who were given either a reinforcer consisting of food for one response or given a verbal reinforcer for another response gave far more accurate answers than those who were given random reinforcers for different responses.

Then in 2002; Odette Miller, Kevin Waugh and Karen Chambers proved that Differential Outcome Effect exists in [[adults]]. This [[experiment]] was novel because it first used average adults ([[college students]])  in the experiment, and had a complex discrimination task which required participants to be able to distinguish between 15 different [[Kanji]] characters. In prior experiments, participants were only required to discriminate between two different stimuli. For the participants in the group given a differential condition, each Kanji character was given a unique [[photo]] and [[prize]] for answering correctly. Participants in the group given a  nondifferential condition were given a random photo and prize for answering the question correctly. The group given a differential condition fared far better than those in the group with the nondifferential condition, demonstrating that the Differential Outcome Effect not only exists in adult humans but also can be applied to tasks requiring discrimination of more than two stimuli.

More recently several studies have looked at the applications of the differential outcomes effect for populations with intellectual disabilities and pervasive developmental disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Esevez,|first=A|date=2003|title=Differential Outcomes Effect in Children and Adults With Down Syndrome.|url=http://www.aaiddjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1352/0895-8017(2003)108%3C0108:DOEICA%3E2.0.CO;2?code=aamr-site|journal=American Journal on Mental Retardation:|volume=108|pages=108–116|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCormack|first=Jessica|last2=Arnold-Saritepe|first2=Angela|last3=Elliffe|first3=Douglas|date=2017-06-30|title=The differential outcomes effect in children with autism|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bin.1489|journal=Behavioral Interventions|language=en|volume=32|issue=4|pages=357–369|doi=10.1002/bin.1489|issn=1072-0847}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientist have theorised that this procedure may be useful in overcoming barriers to learning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2182">'''Euthymia''' ({{lang-el|εὐθυμία}}, "gladness, good mood, [[tranquillity|serenity]]", literally "good [[thumos]]") is a term used by [[Democritus]] to refer to one of the root aspects of human life's goal.

[[Diogenes Laërtius]] records Democritus' position as "The chief good he asserts to be cheerfulness (euthymia); which, however, he does not consider the same as pleasure; as some people, who have misunderstood him, have fancied that he meant; but he understands by cheerfulness, a condition according to which the soul lives calmly and steadily, being disturbed by no fear, or superstition, or other [[Passions (philosophy)|passion]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/diogenes/dldemocritus.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]’s [[De Tranquillitate Animi|essay on tranquility]], he uses the Greek word ''euthymia'', which he defines as “believing in yourself and trusting that you are on the right path, and not being in doubt by following the myriad footpaths of those wandering in every direction.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=iPDUDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT32&amp;lpg=PT32&amp;dq=believing+in+yourself+and+trusting+that+you+are+on+the+right+path,+and+not+being+in+doubt+by+following+the+myriad+footpaths+of+those+wandering+in+every+direction.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Je4s_cM6X6&amp;sig=EGNvhD50W_iyC5DhFDzHf7HM3G8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwju0KSEnbrUAhXCl5QKHVjwAo8Q6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=believing%20in%20yourself%20and%20trusting%20that%20you%20are%20on%20the%20right%20path,%20and%20not%20being%20in%20doubt%20by%20following%20the%20myriad%20footpaths%20of%20those%20wandering%20in%20every%20direction.&amp;f=false|title=The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living: Featuring new translations of Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius|last=Holiday|first=Ryan|last2=Hanselman|first2=Stephen|date=2016-10-27|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=9781782833178|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The principle of evidential existentiality''' in [[philosophy]] is a principle that explains and gives value to the [[existence]] of entities. The principle states that the reality of an entity's existence gives greater value to prove its existence than would be given through any outward studies. The principle has become a backbone of [[Arguments for the existence of God|the God argument]], stating that because God is a [[self-evidence|self-evident]] entity, His existence can only be shared by humans, thus proof of God is unnecessary and moot.
It appears that the existence is primarily evident to the self only. The God or Supreme self is perceivable to the self. So evidentially self perception is followed by God perception and so on.

Where [[metaphysics]] tries to explain what is the universe and what it is like, '''feminist metaphysics''' questions how metaphysical answers have supported [[sexism]].&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Feminist Metaphysics | encyclopedia=[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] | last1=Haslanger|first1=Sally|last2=Sveinsdóttir|first2=Ásta Kristjana | editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first=Edward N. | year=2011 | edition=Winter 2011|oclc=224325075|issn=1095-5054}}&lt;/ref&gt; Are ideas we have about fundamental subjects like: the self, mind and body, nature, essence, and identity formed with gendered bias? For instance, feminist metaphysics would ask if [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]]&amp;mdash;the concept of humans having minds separate from our bodies&amp;mdash;privileges men or [[masculinity]].&lt;ref name="sep" /&gt;

== Social construction ==
The famous quote “One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman,” coined by [[Simone de Beauvoir]], can be considered feminist metaphysical critique.{{cn|date=January 2018}} De Beauvoir does not deny that some people are born with female body parts, but that those body parts need not imply how one is socially situated. Yet for many societies being in possession of those body parts prescribes social roles, norms, and activities, and the differences are said to be necessary, because they are natural.&lt;ref name=SecondSex-1949&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Second Sex|last = de Beauvoir|first = Simone|publisher = Vintage Books|year = 1949|isbn =978-1-473-52191-9  |location = New York|pages = Chapter 1|oclc=896850610|title-link = The Second Sex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since de Beauvoir many feminists have presented the view that social hierarchies are perpetuated by the fallacy that they are metaphysically "natural". In fact, the power that comes from naturalising myths about universal categories, has made feminists wary of accepting that any category at all is "natural". And subsequently a response is that any such supposedly "natural" category, should not be a basis for how we organize ourselves socially.&lt;ref name=AfterIdentity-2008&gt;{{Cite book|title = After Identity: Rethinking Race, Sex, and Gender|last = Warnke|first = Georgia|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2008|isbn =978-0-521-88281-1 |location = Cambridge, UK  &amp; New York |pages = |oclc=165408056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critique of social construction ===
If being a woman is not due to "situation", like biology, de Beauvoir claims that it is due to "instrumentality" of women's freedom.{{huh|date=January 2018|reason=gobbledygook}} Critic [[Judith Butler]] finds this problematic because de Beauvoir's reasoning, now plots "situation" against "instrumentality", plays into Cartesian [[body-freedom dualism]].&lt;ref name=GenderTrouble-1990&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender Trouble|last = Butler|first = Judith|publisher = Routledge|year = 1990|isbn = 978-0-415-90042-3|location = New York |pages = 12|oclc=19630577|title-link = Gender Trouble}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{huh|date=January 2018|reason=gobbledygook}}

{{General relativity |phenomena}}

'''Frame-dragging''' is an effect on [[spacetime]], predicted by [[Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]], that is due to non-static stationary distributions of [[mass–energy]]. A stationary [[Field (physics)|field]] is one that is in a steady state, but the masses causing that field may be non-static, rotating for instance. More generally, the subject of effects caused by mass–energy currents is known as [[gravitomagnetism]], in analogy with [[classical electromagnetism]]. 

The first frame-dragging effect was derived in 1918, in the framework of general relativity, by the Austrian physicists [[Josef Lense]] and [[Hans Thirring]], and is also known as the [[Lense–Thirring effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thirring |first=H. |authorlink= |date=1918 |title=Über die Wirkung rotierender ferner Massen in der Einsteinschen Gravitationstheorie |journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift |volume=19 |issue= |page=33 |bibcode=1918PhyZ...19...33T |url= |accessdate= |quote=}} [On the Effect of Rotating Distant Masses in Einstein's Theory of Gravitation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thirring |first=H. |authorlink= |date=1921 |title=Berichtigung zu meiner Arbeit: ‘Über die Wirkung rotierender Massen in der Einsteinschen Gravitationstheorie’ |journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift |volume=22 |issue= |page=29 |bibcode=1921PhyZ...22...29T |url= |accessdate= |quote=}} [Correction to my paper "On the Effect of Rotating Distant Masses in Einstein's Theory of Gravitation"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lense |first=J. |authorlink= |author2=Thirring, H. |date=1918 |title=Über den Einfluss der Eigenrotation der Zentralkörper auf die Bewegung der Planeten und Monde nach der Einsteinschen Gravitationstheorie |journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift |volume=19 |issue= |pages=156–163 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode=1918PhyZ...19..156L}} [On the Influence of the Proper Rotation of Central Bodies on the Motions of Planets and Moons According to Einstein's Theory of Gravitation]&lt;/ref&gt; They predicted that the rotation of a massive object would distort the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|spacetime metric]], making the orbit of a nearby test particle [[precess]]. This does not happen in [[Newtonian mechanics]] for which the [[gravitational field]] of a body depends only on its mass, not on its rotation. The Lense–Thirring effect is very small—about one part in a few trillion. To detect it, it is necessary to examine a very massive object, or build an instrument that is very sensitive.

In 2015, new general-relativistic extensions of Newtonian rotation laws were formulated to describe geometric dragging of frames which incorporates a newly discovered antidragging effect.&lt;ref&gt;Patryk Mach and Edward Malec, General-relativistic rotation laws in rotating fluid bodies, Phys. Rev. D 91, 124053 – Published 17 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
'''Rotational frame-dragging''' (the [[Lense–Thirring effect]]) appears in the [[general principle of relativity]] and similar theories in the vicinity of rotating massive objects. Under the Lense–Thirring effect, the frame of reference in which a clock ticks the fastest is one which is revolving around the object as viewed by a distant observer. This also means that light traveling in the direction of rotation of the object will move past the massive object faster than light moving against the rotation, as seen by a distant observer. It is now the best known frame-dragging effect, partly thanks to the [[Gravity Probe B]] experiment. Qualitatively, frame-dragging can be viewed as the gravitational analog of [[electromagnetic induction]].

Also, an inner region is dragged more than an outer region. This produces interesting locally rotating frames. For example, imagine that a north-south–oriented ice skater, in orbit over the equator of a black hole and rotationally at rest with respect to the stars, extends her arms. The arm extended toward the black hole will be "torqued" spinward due to gravitomagnetic induction ("torqued" is in quotes because gravitational effects are not considered "forces" under [[General relativity|GR]]). Likewise the arm extended away from the black hole will be torqued anti-spinward. She will therefore be rotationally sped up, in a counter-rotating sense to the black hole. This is the opposite of what happens in everyday experience. There exists a particular rotation rate that, should she be initially rotating at that rate when she extends her arms, inertial effects and frame-dragging effects will balance and her rate of rotation will not change. Due to the [[equivalence principle]], gravitational effects are locally indistinguishable from inertial effects, so this rotation rate, at which when she extends her arms nothing happens, is her local reference for non-rotation. This frame is rotating with respect to the fixed stars and counter-rotating with respect to the black hole. This effect is analogous to the [[hyperfine structure]] in atomic spectra due to nuclear spin. A useful metaphor is a [[planetary gear]] system with the black hole being the sun gear, the ice skater being a planetary gear and the outside universe being the ring gear. See [[Mach's principle]].

Another interesting consequence is that, for an object constrained in an equatorial orbit, but not in freefall, it weighs more if orbiting anti-spinward, and less if orbiting spinward. For example, in a suspended equatorial bowling alley, a bowling ball rolled anti-spinward would weigh more than the same ball rolled in a spinward direction. Note, frame dragging will neither accelerate or slow down the bowling ball in either direction. It is not a "viscosity". Similarly, a stationary [[plumb-bob]] suspended over the rotating object will not list. It will hang vertically. If it starts to fall, induction will push it in the spinward direction.

'''Linear frame dragging''' is the similarly inevitable result of the general principle of relativity, applied to [[linear momentum]]. Although it arguably has equal theoretical legitimacy to the "rotational" effect, the difficulty of obtaining an experimental verification of the effect means that it receives much less discussion and is often omitted from articles on frame-dragging (but see Einstein, 1921).&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, A ''The Meaning of Relativity'' (contains transcripts of his 1921 Princeton lectures).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Static mass increase''' is a third effect noted by Einstein in the same paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Meaning of Relativity |last=Einstein |first=A. |authorlink= |date=1987 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |location=London |isbn= |page= |pages=95–96 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is an increase in [[inertia]] of a body when other masses are placed nearby. While not strictly a frame dragging effect (the term frame dragging is not used by Einstein), it is demonstrated by Einstein that it derives from the same equation of general relativity. It is also a tiny effect that is difficult to confirm experimentally.

A somewhat equivalent, cheaper version of such an idea was put forth in 1986 by Ciufolini&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ciufolini |first=I. |authorlink= |year=1986 |month= |title=Measurement of Lense–Thirring Drag on High-Altitude Laser-Ranged Artificial Satellites |journal=Phys.

The measurable quantity was, in this case, the sum of the nodes of LAGEOS and of the new spacecraft, later named LAGEOS III, [[LARES (satellite)|LARES]], WEBER-SAT.

Limiting the scope to the scenarios involving existing orbiting bodies, the first proposal to use the LAGEOS satellite and the Satellite Laser Ranging ([[Satellite laser ranging|SLR]]) technique to measure the Lense–Thirring effect dates back to 1977–1978.&lt;ref&gt;Cugusi, L., Proverbio E.

In the case of stars orbiting close to a spinning, supermassive black hole, frame dragging should cause the star's orbital plane to [[Lense–Thirring precession|precess]] about the black hole spin axis. This effect should be detectable within the next few years via [[astrometry|astrometric]] monitoring of stars at the center of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
c^{2} d\tau^{2} =&amp;
\left( 1 - \frac{r_{s} r}{\rho^{2}} \right) c^{2} dt^{2}
- \frac{\rho^{2}}{\Lambda^{2}} dr^{2}
- \rho^{2} d\theta^{2} \\
&amp; {} - \left( r^{2} + \alpha^{2} + \frac{r_{s} r \alpha^{2}}{\rho^{2}} \sin^{2} \theta \right) \sin^{2} \theta \ d\phi^{2}
+ \frac{2r_{s} r\alpha c \sin^{2} \theta }{\rho^{2}} d\phi dt
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild radius]]

:&lt;math&gt;
r_{s} = \frac{2GM}{c^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

and where the following shorthand variables have been introduced for brevity

:&lt;math&gt;
\alpha = \frac{J}{Mc}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho^{2} = r^{2} + \alpha^{2} \cos^{2} \theta\,\!
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\Lambda^{2} = r^{2} - r_{s} r + \alpha^{2}\,\!
&lt;/math&gt;

In the non-relativistic limit where ''M'' (or, equivalently, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;) goes to zero, the Kerr metric becomes the orthogonal metric for the [[oblate spheroidal coordinates]]

:&lt;math&gt;
c^{2} d\tau^{2} =
c^{2} dt^{2}
- \frac{\rho^{2}}{r^{2} + \alpha^{2}} dr^{2}
- \rho^{2} d\theta^{2}
- \left( r^{2} + \alpha^{2} \right) \sin^{2}\theta d\phi^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

We may rewrite the Kerr metric in the following form

:&lt;math&gt;
c^{2} d\tau^{2} =
\left( g_{tt} - \frac{g_{t\phi}^{2}}{g_{\phi\phi}} \right) dt^{2}
+ g_{rr} dr^{2} + g_{\theta\theta} d\theta^{2} +
g_{\phi\phi} \left( d\phi + \frac{g_{t\phi}}{g_{\phi\phi}} dt \right)^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

This metric is equivalent to a co-rotating reference frame that is rotating with angular speed Ω that depends on both the radius ''r'' and the [[colatitude]] θ

:&lt;math&gt;
\Omega = -\frac{g_{t\phi}}{g_{\phi\phi}} = \frac{r_{s} \alpha r c}{\rho^{2} \left( r^{2} + \alpha^{2} \right) + r_{s} \alpha^{2} r \sin^{2}\theta}
&lt;/math&gt;

In the plane of the equator this simplifies to:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tartaglia |first=A. |authorlink= |date=2008 |title=Detection of the gravitometric clock effect |journal= Classical and Quantum Gravity|volume= 17|issue= |pages= 783–792|id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |arxiv=gr-qc/9909006v2|bibcode = 2000CQGra..17..783T |doi = 10.1088/0264-9381/17/4/304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\Omega = \frac{r_{s} \alpha c}{r^{3} + \alpha^{2} r + r_{s} \alpha^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, an inertial reference frame is entrained by the rotating central mass to participate in the latter's rotation; this is frame-dragging.

Consequently, particles within this ergosphere must co-rotate with the inner mass, if they are to retain their time-like character.]]

An extreme version of frame dragging occurs within the [[ergosphere]] of a rotating [[black hole]]. The Kerr metric has two surfaces on which it appears to be singular. The inner surface corresponds to a spherical [[event horizon]] similar to that observed in the [[Schwarzschild metric]]; this occurs at

:&lt;math&gt;
r_\text{inner} = \frac{r_{s} + \sqrt{r_{s}^{2} - 4\alpha^{2}}}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the purely radial component ''g&lt;sub&gt;rr&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the metric goes to infinity. The outer surface can be approximated by an [[oblate spheroid]] with lower spin parameters, and resembles a pumpkin-shape&lt;ref name=visser /&gt;&lt;ref name=blundell /&gt; with higher spin parameters. It touches the inner surface at the poles of the rotation axis, where the colatitude θ equals 0 or π; its radius in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates is defined by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;
r_\text{outer} = \frac{r_{s} + \sqrt{r_{s}^{2} - 4\alpha^{2} \cos^{2}\theta}}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the purely temporal component ''g&lt;sub&gt;tt&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the metric changes sign from positive to negative. The space between these two surfaces is called the [[ergosphere]]. A moving particle experiences a positive [[proper time]] along its [[worldline]], its path through [[spacetime]]. However, this is impossible within the ergosphere, where ''g&lt;sub&gt;tt&lt;/sub&gt;'' is negative, unless the particle is co-rotating with the interior mass ''M'' with an angular speed at least of Ω. However, as seen above, frame-dragging occurs about every rotating mass and at every radius ''r'' and colatitude θ, not only within the ergosphere.

===Lense–Thirring effect inside a rotating shell===
The [[Lense–Thirring effect]] inside a rotating shell was taken by [[Albert Einstein]] as not just support for, but a vindication of [[Mach's principle]], in a letter he wrote to [[Ernst Mach]] in 1913 (five years before Lense and Thirring's work, and two years before he had attained the final form of [[general relativity]]). A reproduction of the letter can be found in [[Gravitation (book)|Misner, Thorne, Wheeler]].&lt;ref name=mtw&gt;Misner, Thorne, Wheeler, ''Gravitation'', Figure 21.5, page 544&lt;/ref&gt; The general effect scaled up to cosmological distances, is still used as a support for Mach's principle.&lt;ref name=mtw/&gt;

Inside a rotating spherical shell the acceleration due to the Lense–Thirring effect would be&lt;ref name=phister&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pfister |first=Herbert |authorlink= |date=2005 |title=On the history of the so-called Lense–Thirring effect |journal=General Relativity and Gravitation |volume=39 |issue=11 |pages=1735–1748 |doi=10.1007/s10714-007-0521-4 |url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00002681/ |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode = 2007GReGr..39.1735P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

\bar{a} = -2d_1 \left( \bar{ \omega} \times \bar v \right) - d_2 \left[ \bar{ \omega} \times \left( \bar{ \omega} \times \bar{r} \right) + 2\left( \bar{ \omega}\bar{r} \right) \bar{ \omega} \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d_1 &amp;= \frac{4MG}{3Rc^2} \\
d_2 &amp;= \frac{4MG}{15Rc^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''MG'' ≪ ''Rc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or more precisely,

: &lt;math&gt;
d_1 = \frac{4 \alpha(2 - \alpha)}{(1 + \alpha)(3- \alpha)}, \qquad \alpha=\frac{MG}{2Rc^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

The spacetime inside the rotating spherical shell will not be flat. A flat spacetime inside a rotating mass shell is possible if the shell is allowed to deviate from a precisely spherical shape and the mass density inside the shell is allowed to vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pfister |first=H. |authorlink= |date=1985 |title=Induction of correct centrifugal force in a rotating mass shell |journal=Class.

[[Image:Rubik's cube.svg|thumb|right|The manipulations of this [[Rubik's Cube]] form the [[Rubik's Cube group]].]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''group''' is an [[algebraic structure]] consisting of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[element (mathematics)|elements]] equipped with a [[binary operation]] which combines any two elements to form a third element. To be a group, this operation must satisfy four conditions called the group [[axiom]]s, namely [[Closure (mathematics)|closure]], [[associativity]], [[identity element|identity]] and [[Inverse elements|invertibility]]. One of the most familiar examples of a group is the set of [[integer]]s together with the [[addition]] operation, but the abstract formalization of the group axioms, detached as it is from the concrete nature of any particular group and its operation, applies much more widely.  It allows entities with highly diverse mathematical origins in [[abstract algebra]] and beyond to be handled in a flexible way while retaining their essential structural aspects. The ubiquity of groups in numerous areas within and outside mathematics makes them a central organizing principle of contemporary mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Herstein|year = 1975|loc = §2, p. 26|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Hall|year = 1967|loc = §1.1, p. 1|nb = yes}}: "The idea of a group is one which pervades the whole of mathematics both pure and applied."&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups share a fundamental kinship with the notion of [[symmetry]]. For example, a [[symmetry group]] encodes symmetry features of a [[geometry|geometrical]] object: the group consists of the set of transformations that leave the object unchanged and the operation of combining two such transformations by performing one after the other. [[Lie group]]s are the symmetry groups used in the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]]; [[Poincaré group]]s, which are also Lie groups, can express the physical symmetry underlying [[special relativity]]; and [[point group]]s are used to help understand [[Molecular symmetry|symmetry phenomena in molecular chemistry]].

The concept of a group arose from the study of [[polynomial equations]], starting with [[Évariste Galois]] in the 1830s.  After contributions from other fields such as [[number theory]] and geometry, the group notion was generalized and firmly established around 1870.  Modern [[group theory]]—an active mathematical discipline—studies groups in their own right.{{cref|a}} To explore groups, mathematicians have devised [[Glossary of group theory|various notions]] to break groups into smaller, better-understandable pieces, such as [[subgroup]]s, [[quotient group]]s and [[simple group]]s. In addition to their abstract properties, group theorists also study the different ways in which a group can be expressed concretely, both from a point of view of [[representation theory]] (that is, through the [[group representation|representations of the group]]) and of [[computational group theory]].  A theory has been developed for [[finite group]]s, which culminated with the [[classification of finite simple groups]], completed in 2004.{{cref|aa}} Since the mid-1980s, [[geometric group theory]], which studies [[finitely generated group]]s as geometric objects, has become a particularly active area in group theory.

== Definition and illustration==

===First example: the integers===
One of the most familiar groups is the set of [[integers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; which consists of the numbers
:..., −4, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,&amp;nbsp;...,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = App. 2, p. 360|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with [[addition]].
The following properties of integer addition serve as a model for the group axioms given in the definition below.

*For any two integers ''a'' and ''b'', the [[Summation|sum]] ''a'' + ''b'' is also an integer. That is, addition of integers always yields an integer. This property is known as ''[[Closure (mathematics)|closure]]'' under addition.
*For all integers ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' = ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'').   Expressed in words, adding ''a'' to ''b'' first, and then adding the result to ''c'' gives the same final result as adding ''a'' to the sum of ''b'' and ''c'', a property known as ''[[associativity]]''.
*If ''a'' is any integer, then 0 + ''a'' = ''a'' + 0 = ''a''. [[Zero]] is called the ''[[identity element]]'' of addition because adding it to any integer returns the same integer.
*For every integer ''a'', there is an integer ''b'' such that ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a'' = 0. The integer ''b''  is called the ''[[inverse element]]'' of the integer ''a'' and is denoted −''a''.

The integers, together with the operation +, form a mathematical object belonging to a broad class sharing similar structural aspects. To appropriately understand these structures as a collective, the following [[definition]] is developed.

A group is a [[set (mathematics)|set]], ''G'', together with an [[Binary operation|operation]] • (called the ''group law'' of ''G'') that combines any two [[element (mathematics)|elements]] ''a'' and ''b'' to form another element, denoted {{nowrap|''a'' • ''b''}} or ''ab''. To qualify as a group, the set and operation, {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}}, must satisfy four requirements known as the ''group axioms'':&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Herstein|year = 1975|loc = §2.1, p. 27|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Closure: For all ''a'', ''b'' in ''G'', the result of the operation, ''a'' • ''b'', is also in ''G''.{{cref|b}}
;Associativity: For all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''G'', (''a'' • ''b'') • ''c'' = ''a'' • (''b'' • ''c'').
;Identity element: There exists an element ''e'' in ''G'' such that, for every element ''a'' in ''G'', the equation {{nowrap|1=''e'' • ''a'' = ''a'' • ''e'' = ''a''}} holds. Such an element is unique ([[#Uniqueness of identity element and inverses|see below]]), and thus one speaks of ''the'' identity element. 
;Inverse element: For each ''a'' in ''G'', there exists an element ''b'' in ''G'', commonly denoted ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (or −''a'', if the operation is denoted "+"), such that ''a'' • ''b'' = ''b'' • ''a'' = ''e'', where ''e'' is the identity element.

The result of an operation may depend on the order of the operands. In other words, the result of combining element ''a'' with element ''b'' need not yield the same result as combining element ''b'' with element ''a''; the equation
:{{nowrap|1=''a'' • ''b'' = ''b'' • ''a''}}
may not always be true. This equation always holds in the group of integers under addition, because {{nowrap|1=''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''}} for any two integers  ([[commutativity]] of addition). Groups for which the commutativity equation {{nowrap|1=''a'' • ''b'' = ''b'' • ''a''}} always holds are called ''[[abelian group]]s'' (in honor of [[Niels Henrik Abel]]). The symmetry group described in the following section is an example of a group that is not abelian.

The identity element of a group ''G'' is often written as 1 or 1&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld |title=Identity Element |urlname=IdentityElement}}&lt;/ref&gt; a notation inherited from the [[multiplicative identity]]. If a group is abelian, then one may choose to denote the group operation by + and the identity element by 0; in that case, the group is called an additive group. The identity element can also be written as ''id''.

The set ''G'' is called the ''underlying set'' of the group {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}}. Often the group's underlying set ''G'' is used as a short name for the group {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}}. Along the same lines, shorthand expressions such as "a subset of the group ''G''" or "an element of group ''G''" are used when what is actually meant is "a subset of the underlying set ''G'' of the group {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}}" or "an element of the underlying set ''G'' of the group {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}}".  Usually, it is clear from the context whether a symbol like ''G'' refers to a group or to an underlying set.

An alternate (but equivalent) definition is to expand the structure of a group to define a group as a set equipped with three operations satisfying the same axioms as above, with the "there exists" part removed in the two last axioms, these operations being
the group law, as above, which is a [[binary operation]],
the ''inverse operation'', which is a [[unary operation]] and maps {{mvar|a}} to &lt;math&gt;a^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;
and the identity element, which is viewed as a [[0-ary function|0-ary operation]].

As this formulation of the definition avoids [[existential quantifier]]s, it is generally preferred for [[computational group theory|computing with groups]] and for [[computer-aided proof]]s. This formulation exhibits groups as a variety of [[universal algebra]]. It is also useful for talking of properties of the inverse operation, as needed for defining [[topological group]]s and [[group object]]s.

=== Second example: a symmetry group ===
Two figures in the plane are [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] if one can be changed into the other using a combination of [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s, [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s, and [[translation (geometry)|translation]]s.  Any figure is congruent to itself.  However, some figures are congruent to themselves in more than one way, and these extra congruences are called [[symmetry|symmetries]]. A square has eight symmetries. These are:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|+ The elements of the symmetry group of the square (D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Vertices are identified by color or number.

* the [[identity operation]] leaving everything unchanged, denoted id;
* rotations of the square around its center by 90° clockwise, 180° clockwise, and 270° clockwise, denoted by r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively;
* reflections about the vertical and horizontal middle line (f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; and f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;), or through the two [[diagonal]]s (f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; and f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;).
{{clear}}

These symmetries are represented by functions. Each of these functions sends a point in the square to the corresponding point under the symmetry. For example, r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; sends a point to its rotation 90° clockwise around the square's center, and f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; sends a point to its reflection across the square's vertical middle line. Composing two of these symmetry functions gives another symmetry function.  These symmetries determine a group called the [[dihedral group]] of degree 4 and denoted D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  The underlying set of the group is the above set of symmetry functions, and the group operation is [[function composition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Herstein|year = 1975|loc = §2.6, p. 54|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two symmetries are combined by composing them as functions, that is, applying the first one to the square, and the second one to the result of the first application.  The result of performing first ''a'' and then ''b'' is written symbolically ''from right to left'' as
:{{nowrap|''b'' • ''a''}} ("apply the symmetry ''b'' after performing the symmetry ''a''").
The right-to-left notation is the same notation that is used for composition of functions.

The [[group table]] on the right lists the results of all such compositions possible. For example, rotating by 270° clockwise (r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and then reflecting horizontally (f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) is the same as performing a reflection along the diagonal (f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;). Using the above symbols, highlighted in blue in the group table:
:{{nowrap|1=f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Given this set of symmetries and the described operation, the group axioms can be understood as follows:
{{ordered list
|1= The closure axiom demands that the composition {{nowrap|''b'' • ''a''}} of any two symmetries ''a'' and ''b'' is also a symmetry. Another example for the group operation is
:{{nowrap|r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; • f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;,}}
i.e., rotating 270° clockwise after reflecting horizontally equals reflecting along the counter-diagonal (f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;). Indeed every other combination of two symmetries still gives a symmetry, as can be checked using the group table.

|2= The associativity constraint deals with composing more than two symmetries: Starting with three elements ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' of D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, there are two possible ways of using these three symmetries in this order to determine a symmetry of the square.  One of these ways is to first compose ''a'' and ''b'' into a single symmetry, then to compose that symmetry with ''c''.  The other way is to first compose ''b'' and ''c'', then to compose the resulting symmetry with ''a''.  The associativity condition
:{{nowrap|1=(''a'' • ''b'') • ''c'' = ''a'' • (''b'' • ''c'')}}
means that these two ways are the same, i.e., a product of many group elements can be simplified in any grouping.
For example, {{nowrap|1=(f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; • f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) • r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; • (f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} can be checked using the group table at the right
{{aligned table|cols=5|style=margin-left:1.2em
|(f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; • f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) • r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;|r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;|r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which equals
|f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; • (f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)|{{=}}|f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; • f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;|{{=}}|r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
}}
While associativity is true for the symmetries of the square and addition of numbers, it is not true for all operations.  For instance, subtraction of numbers is not associative: {{nowrap|(7 − 3) − 2 {{=}} 2}} is not the same as {{nowrap|7 − (3 − 2) {{=}} 6.}}

|3= The identity element is the symmetry id leaving everything unchanged: for any symmetry ''a'', performing id after ''a'' (or ''a'' after id) equals ''a'', in symbolic form,
: {{nowrap|1=id • ''a'' = ''a'',}}
: {{nowrap|1=''a'' • id = ''a''.}}

|4= An inverse element undoes the transformation of some other element. Every symmetry can be undone: each of the following transformations—identity id, the reflections f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and the 180° rotation r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;—is its own inverse, because performing it twice brings the square back to its original orientation. The rotations r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are each other's inverses, because rotating 90° and then rotation 270° (or vice versa) yields a rotation over 360° which leaves the square unchanged. In symbols,
:{{nowrap|f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; • f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} id,}}
:{{nowrap|r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} id.}}
}}

In contrast to the group of integers above, where the order of the operation is irrelevant, it does matter in D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;: {{nowrap|f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} but {{nowrap|r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; • f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;.}} In other words, D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is not abelian, which makes the group structure more difficult than the integers introduced first.

== History ==
{{Main|History of group theory}}
The modern concept of an abstract group developed out of several fields of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Wussing|year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Kleiner|year = 1986|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Smith|year = 1906|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original motivation for group theory was the quest for solutions of [[polynomial equation]]s of degree higher than 4. The 19th-century French mathematician [[Évariste Galois]], extending prior work of [[Paolo Ruffini]] and [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], gave a criterion for the solvability of a particular polynomial equation in terms of the [[symmetry group]] of its [[root of a function|roots]] (solutions).  The elements of such a [[Galois group]] correspond to certain [[permutation]]s of the roots. At first, Galois' ideas were rejected by his contemporaries, and published only posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Galois|year = 1908|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Kleiner|year = 1986|loc = p. 202|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; More general [[permutation group]]s were investigated in particular by [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]]. [[Arthur Cayley]]'s ''On the theory of groups, as depending on the symbolic equation θ&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; = 1'' (1854) gives the first abstract definition of a [[finite group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last=Cayley|year=1889|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geometry was a second field in which groups were used systematically, especially symmetry groups as part of [[Felix Klein]]'s 1872 [[Erlangen program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Wussing|year = 2007|loc = §III.2|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; After novel geometries such as [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] and [[projective geometry]] had emerged, Klein used group theory to organize them in a more coherent way. Further advancing these ideas, [[Sophus Lie]] founded the study of [[Lie group]]s in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last=Lie|year=1973|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third field contributing to group theory was [[number theory]]. Certain [[abelian group]] structures had been used implicitly in [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]' number-theoretical work ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (1798), and more explicitly by [[Leopold Kronecker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Kleiner|year = 1986|loc = p. 204|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, [[Ernst Kummer]] made early attempts to prove [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]  by developing [[class group|groups describing factorization]] into [[prime number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Wussing|year = 2007|loc = §I.3.4|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convergence of these various sources into a uniform theory of groups started with [[Camille Jordan]]'s ''Traité des substitutions et des équations algébriques'' (1870).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last=Jordan|year=1870|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walther von Dyck]] (1882) introduced the idea of specifying a group by means of generators and relations, and was also the first to give an axiomatic definition of an "abstract group", in the terminology of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last=von Dyck|year=1882|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 20th century, groups gained wide recognition by the pioneering work of [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius]] and [[William Burnside]], who worked on [[representation theory]] of finite groups, [[Richard Brauer]]'s [[modular representation theory]] and [[Issai Schur]]'s papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Curtis |year = 2003|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of Lie groups, and more generally [[locally compact group]]s was studied by [[Hermann Weyl]], [[Élie Cartan]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last=Mackey|year=1976|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its algebraic counterpart, the theory of [[algebraic group]]s, was first shaped by [[Claude Chevalley]] (from the late 1930s) and later by the work of [[Armand Borel]] and [[Jacques Tits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last=Borel|year=2001|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Chicago]]'s 1960–61 Group Theory Year brought together group theorists such as [[Daniel Gorenstein]], [[John G. Thompson]] and [[Walter Feit]], laying the foundation of a collaboration that, with input from numerous other mathematicians, led to the [[classification of finite simple groups]], with the final step taken by [[Michael Aschbacher|Aschbacher]] and Smith in 2004. This project exceeded previous mathematical endeavours by its sheer size, in both length of proof and number of researchers. Research is ongoing to simplify the proof of this classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Aschbacher|year = 2004|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; These days, group theory is still a highly active mathematical branch, impacting many other fields.{{cref|a}}

==Elementary consequences of the group axioms ==
Basic facts about all groups that can be obtained directly from the group axioms are commonly subsumed under ''elementary group theory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Ledermann|year = 1953|loc = §1.2, pp. 4–5|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Mathematical induction|repeated]] applications of the associativity axiom show that the unambiguity of
:''a'' • ''b'' • ''c'' = (''a'' • ''b'') • ''c'' = ''a'' • (''b'' • ''c'')
generalizes to more than three factors. Because this implies that parentheses can be inserted anywhere within such a series of terms, parentheses are usually omitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Ledermann|year = 1973|loc = §I.1, p. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The axioms may be weakened to assert only the existence of a [[left identity]] and [[left inverse element|left inverse]]s. Both can be shown to be actually two-sided, so the resulting definition is equivalent to the one given above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = §I.2, p. 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uniqueness of identity element and inverses===
Two important consequences of the group axioms are the uniqueness of the identity element and the uniqueness of inverse elements. There can be only one identity element in a group, and each element in a group has exactly one inverse element. Thus, it is customary to speak of ''the'' identity, and ''the'' inverse of an element.&lt;ref name="lang2005"&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.1, p. 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prove the uniqueness of an inverse element of ''a'', suppose that ''a'' has two inverses, denoted ''b'' and ''c'', in a group (''G'', •). Then

:{|
|''b'' ||=||''b'' • ''e'' ||&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||as ''e'' is the identity element
|-
| ||=||''b'' • (''a'' • ''c'') ||&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||because ''c'' is an inverse of ''a'', so ''e'' = ''a'' • ''c''
|-
| ||=||(''b'' • ''a'') • ''c'' ||&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||by associativity, which allows rearranging the parentheses
|-
| ||=||''e'' • ''c''||&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||since ''b'' is an inverse of ''a'', i.e., ''b'' • ''a'' = ''e''
|-
| ||=||''c''||&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|| for ''e'' is the identity element
|}

The term ''b'' on the first line above and the ''c'' on the last are equal, since they are connected by a chain of equalities. In other words, there is only one inverse element of ''a''.  Similarly, to prove that the identity element of a group is unique, assume ''G'' is a group with two identity elements ''e'' and ''f''. Then ''e'' = ''e'' • ''f'' = ''f'', hence ''e'' and ''f'' are equal.

===&lt;span id="translation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Division===
In groups, the existence of inverse elements implies that [[division (mathematics)|division]] is possible: given elements ''a'' and ''b'' of the group ''G'', there is exactly one solution ''x'' in ''G'' to the [[equation]] {{nowrap|1=''x'' • ''a'' = ''b''}}, namely {{nowrap|''b'' • ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="lang2005"/&gt; In fact, we have 
:{{nowrap|1= (''b'' • ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) • ''a'' =  ''b'' • (''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; • ''a'') = ''b'' • ''e'' = ''b''.}}
Uniqueness results by multiplying the two sides of the equation {{nowrap|1=''x'' • ''a'' = ''b''}} by {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The element {{nowrap|''b'' • ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, often denoted {{nowrap|''b'' / ''a''}}, is called the ''right quotient'' of ''b'' by ''a'', or the result of the ''right division'' of ''b'' by ''a''.

Similarly there is exactly one solution ''y'' in ''G'' to the equation {{nowrap|1=''a'' • ''y'' = ''b''}}, namely {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; • ''b''}}. This solution is the ''left quotient'' of ''b'' by ''a'', and is sometimes denoted {{nowrap|''a'' \ ''b''}}.

In general {{nowrap|''b'' / ''a''}} and {{nowrap|''a'' \ ''b''}} may be different, but, if the group operation is [[commutative]] (that is, if the group is [[abelian group|abelian]]), they are equal. In this case, the group operation is often denoted as an [[addition]], and one talks of ''subtraction'' and ''difference'' instead of division and quotient.

A consequence of this is that multiplication by a group element ''g'' is a [[bijection]]. Specifically, if ''g'' is an element of the group ''G'', the [[function (mathematics)]] from ''G'' to itself that maps {{nowrap|''h'' ∈ ''G''}} to {{nowrap|''g'' • ''h''}} is a bijection. This function is called the ''left translation'' by ''g'' . Similarly, the ''right translation'' by ''g'' is the bijection from ''G'' to itself, that maps ''h'' to {{nowrap|''h'' • ''g''}}. If ''G'' is abelian, the left and the right translation by a group element are the same.

== Basic concepts ==
:&lt;div class="dablink"&gt;''The following sections use [[table of mathematical symbols|mathematical symbols]] such as'' {{nowrap|1=''X'' = {''x'', ''y'', ''z''} }} ''to denote a [[set (mathematics)|set]]'' ''X'' ''containing [[element (mathematics)|elements]]'' ''x'', ''y'', ''and'' ''z'', ''or alternatively'' {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''X''}} ''to restate that'' ''x'' ''is an element of'' ''X''. ''The notation'' {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} ''means'' ''f'' ''is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] assigning to every element of'' ''X'' ''an element of'' ''Y''.&lt;/div&gt;

To understand groups beyond the level of mere symbolic manipulations as above, more structural concepts have to be employed.{{cref|c}} There is a conceptual principle underlying all of the following notions: to take advantage of the structure offered by groups (which sets, being "structureless", do not have), constructions related to groups have to be ''compatible'' with the group operation. This compatibility manifests itself in the following notions in various ways. For example, groups can be related to each other via functions called group homomorphisms. By the mentioned principle, they are required to respect the group structures in a precise sense. The structure of groups can also be understood by breaking them into pieces called subgroups and quotient groups. The principle of "preserving structures"—a recurring topic in mathematics throughout—is an instance of working in a [[category (mathematics)|category]], in this case the [[category of groups]].&lt;ref name="MacLane"/&gt;

===Group homomorphisms===
{{Main|Group homomorphism}}
''Group homomorphisms''{{cref|g}} are functions that preserve group structure.  A function {{nowrap|''a'': ''G'' → ''H''}} between two groups {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}} and {{nowrap|(''H'', ∗)}} is called a ''homomorphism'' if the equation
:{{nowrap|1=''a''(''g'' • ''k'') = ''a''(''g'') ∗ ''a''(''k'')}}
holds for all elements ''g'', ''k'' in ''G''. In other words, the result is the same when performing the group operation after or before applying the map ''a''. This requirement ensures that {{nowrap|1=''a''(1&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1&lt;sub&gt;''H''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and also {{nowrap|1=''a''(''g'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''(''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)}} for all ''g'' in ''G''. Thus a group homomorphism respects all the structure of ''G'' provided by the group axioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.3, p. 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two groups ''G'' and ''H'' are called ''[[Group isomorphism|isomorphic]]'' if there exist group homomorphisms {{nowrap|''a'': ''G'' → ''H''}} and {{nowrap|''b'': ''H'' → ''G''}}, such that applying the two functions [[function composition|one after another]] in each of the two possible orders gives the [[identity function]]s of ''G'' and ''H''. That is, {{nowrap|1=''a''(''b''(''h'')) = ''h''}} and {{nowrap|1=''b''(''a''(''g'')) = ''g''}} for any ''g'' in ''G'' and ''h'' in ''H''. From an abstract point of view, isomorphic groups carry the same information. For example, proving that {{nowrap|1=''g'' • ''g'' = 1&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for some element ''g'' of ''G'' is [[Logical equivalence|equivalent]] to proving that {{nowrap|1=''a''(''g'') ∗ ''a''(''g'') = 1&lt;sub&gt;''H''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, because applying ''a'' to the first equality yields the second, and applying ''b'' to the second gives back the first.

===Subgroups===
{{Main|Subgroup}}
Informally, a ''subgroup'' is a group ''H'' contained within a bigger one, ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.1, p. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concretely, the identity element of ''G'' is  contained in ''H'', and whenever ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are in ''H'', then so are {{nowrap|''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; •  ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, so the elements of ''H'', equipped with the group operation on ''G'' restricted to ''H'', indeed form a group.

In the example above, the identity and the rotations constitute a subgroup {{nowrap|1=''R'' = {id, r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;},}} highlighted in red in the group table above: any two rotations composed are still a rotation, and a rotation can be undone by (i.e., is inverse to) the complementary rotations  270° for 90°, 180° for 180°, and 90° for 270° (note that rotation in the opposite direction is not defined). The [[subgroup test]] is a [[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary and sufficient condition]] for a nonempty subset ''H'' of a group ''G'' to be a subgroup: it is sufficient to check that {{nowrap|''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''h'' ∈ ''H''}} for all elements {{nowrap|''g'', ''h'' ∈ ''H''}}. Knowing [[lattice of subgroups|the subgroups]] is important in understanding the group as a whole.{{cref|d}}

Given any subset ''S'' of a group ''G'', the subgroup generated by ''S'' consists of products of elements of ''S'' and their inverses. It is the smallest subgroup of ''G'' containing ''S''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Ledermann|year = 1973|loc = §II.12, p. 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the introductory example above, the subgroup generated by r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; consists of these two elements, the identity element id and {{nowrap|1=f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; = f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Again, this is a subgroup, because combining any two of these four elements or their inverses (which are, in this particular case, these same elements) yields an element of this subgroup.

===Cosets===
{{Main|Coset}}
In many situations it is desirable to consider two group elements the same if they differ by an element of a given subgroup. For example, in D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; above, once a reflection is performed, the square never gets back to the r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; configuration by just applying the rotation operations (and no further reflections), i.e., the rotation operations are irrelevant to the question whether a reflection has been performed. Cosets are used to formalize this insight: a subgroup ''H'' defines left and right cosets, which can be thought of as translations of ''H'' by arbitrary group elements ''g''. In symbolic terms, the ''left'' and ''right'' cosets of ''H'' containing ''g'' are

:{{nowrap|1=''gH'' = {''g'' • ''h'' : ''h'' ∈ ''H''} }} and {{nowrap|1=''Hg'' = {''h'' • ''g'' : ''h'' ∈ ''H''},}} respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.4, p. 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The left cosets of any subgroup ''H'' form a [[Partition of a set|partition]] of ''G''; that is, the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of all left cosets is equal to ''G'' and two left cosets are either equal or have an [[empty set|empty]] [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = §I.2, p. 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first case {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''H'' = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''H''}} happens [[if and only if|precisely when]] {{nowrap|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; • ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''H''}}, i.e., if the two elements differ by an element of ''H''. Similar considerations apply to the right cosets of ''H''. The left and right cosets of ''H'' may or may not be equal. If they are, i.e., for all ''g'' in ''G'', {{nowrap|1=''gH'' = ''Hg''}}, then ''H'' is said to be a ''[[normal subgroup]]''.

In D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the introductory symmetry group, the left cosets ''gR'' of the subgroup ''R'' consisting of the rotations are either equal to ''R'', if ''g'' is an element of ''R'' itself, or otherwise equal to {{nowrap|1=''U'' = f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' = {f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;} }} (highlighted in green). The subgroup ''R'' is also normal, because {{nowrap|1=f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' = ''U'' = ''R''f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} and similarly for any element other than f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. (In fact, in the case of D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, observe that all such cosets are equal, such that {{nowrap|1=f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' = f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' = f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' = f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''R''}}.)

===Quotient groups===
{{Main|Quotient group}}
In some situations the set of cosets of a subgroup can be endowed with a group law, giving a ''quotient group'' or ''factor group''. For this to be possible, the subgroup has to be [[normal subgroup|normal]]. Given any normal subgroup ''N'', the quotient group is defined by
:''G'' / ''N'' = {''gN'', ''g'' ∈ ''G''}, "''G'' modulo ''N''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.4, p. 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This set inherits a group operation (sometimes called coset multiplication, or coset addition) from the original group ''G'': {{nowrap|1=(''gN'') • (''hN'') = (''gh'')''N''}} for all ''g'' and ''h'' in ''G''. This definition is motivated by the idea (itself an instance of general structural considerations outlined above) that the map {{nowrap|''G'' → ''G'' / ''N''}} that associates to any element ''g'' its coset ''gN'' be a group homomorphism, or by general abstract considerations called [[universal property|universal properties]]. The coset {{nowrap|1=''eN '' = ''N''}} serves as the identity in this group, and the inverse of ''gN'' in the quotient group is {{nowrap|1=(''gN'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = (''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)''N''}}.{{cref|e}}

{| class="wikitable" style="float:right; text-align:center; margin:.5em 0 .5em 1em; width:200px;"

The elements of the quotient group {{nowrap|D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; / ''R''}} are ''R'' itself, which represents the identity, and {{nowrap|1=''U'' = f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''R''}}. The group operation on the quotient is shown at the right. For example, {{nowrap|1=''U'' • ''U'' = f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' • f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' = (f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; • f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;)''R'' = ''R''}}. Both the subgroup {{nowrap|1=''R'' = {id, r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;},}} as well as the corresponding quotient are abelian, whereas D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is not abelian. Building bigger groups by smaller ones, such as D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from its subgroup ''R'' and the quotient {{nowrap|D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; / ''R''}} is abstracted by a notion called [[semidirect product]].

Quotient groups and subgroups together form a way of describing every group by its ''[[presentation of a group|presentation]]'': any group is the quotient of the [[free group]] over the ''[[Generating set of a group|generators]]'' of the group, quotiented by the subgroup of ''relations''. The dihedral group D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, for example, can be generated by two elements ''r'' and ''f'' (for example, ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the right rotation and ''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; the vertical (or any other) reflection), which means that every symmetry of the square is a finite composition of these two symmetries or their inverses. Together with the relations
:''r ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''r'' • ''f'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = §I.2, p. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the group is completely described. A presentation of a group can also be used to construct the [[Cayley graph]], a device used to graphically capture [[discrete group]]s.

Sub- and quotient groups are related in the following way: a subset ''H'' of ''G'' can be seen as an [[injective]] map {{nowrap|''H'' → ''G''}}, i.e., any element of the target has at most one [[preimage|element that maps to it]]. The counterpart to injective maps are [[surjective]] maps (every element of the target is mapped onto), such as the canonical map {{nowrap|''G'' → ''G'' / ''N''}}.{{cref|y}} Interpreting subgroup and quotients in light of these homomorphisms emphasizes the structural concept inherent to these definitions alluded to in the introduction. In general, homomorphisms are neither injective nor surjective. [[Kernel (algebra)|Kernel]] and [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of group homomorphisms and the [[first isomorphism theorem]] address this phenomenon.

Examples and applications of groups abound. A starting point is the group '''Z''' of integers with addition as group operation, introduced above. If instead of addition [[multiplication]] is considered, one obtains [[multiplicative group]]s. These groups are predecessors of important constructions in [[abstract algebra]].

Groups are also applied in many other mathematical areas. Mathematical objects are often examined by [[functor|associating]] groups to them and studying the properties of the corresponding groups. For example, [[Henri Poincaré]] founded what is now called [[algebraic topology]] by introducing the [[fundamental group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Hatcher|year = 2002|loc = Chapter I, p. 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; By means of this connection, [[Glossary of topology|topological properties]] such as [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|proximity]] and [[continuous function|continuity]] translate into properties of groups.{{cref|i}} For example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered [[null-homotopic]] (and thus irrelevant), because it can be [[homotopy|continuously shrunk]] to a point. The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop [[winding number|winding once]] around the hole). This way, the fundamental group detects the hole.

In more recent applications, the influence has also been reversed to motivate geometric constructions by a group-theoretical background.{{cref|j}} In a similar vein, [[geometric group theory]] employs geometric concepts, for example in the study of [[hyperbolic group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Coornaert|last2 = Delzant|last3=Papadopoulos|year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further branches crucially applying groups include [[algebraic geometry]] and [[number theory]].&lt;ref&gt;for example, [[class group]]s and [[Picard group]]s; see {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Neukirch|year = 1999}}, in particular §§I.12 and I.13&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the above theoretical applications, many practical applications of groups exist. [[Cryptography]] relies on the combination of the abstract group theory approach together with [[algorithm]]ical knowledge obtained in [[computational group theory]], in particular when implemented for finite groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Seress|year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications of group theory are not restricted to mathematics; sciences such as [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[computer science]] benefit from the concept.

=== Numbers ===
Many number systems, such as the integers and the rationals enjoy a naturally given group structure. In some cases, such as with the rationals, both addition and multiplication operations give rise to group structures. Such number systems are predecessors to more general algebraic structures known as [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]]. Further [[abstract algebra]]ic concepts such as [[module (mathematics)|module]]s, [[vector space]]s and [[algebra over a field|algebras]] also form groups.

==== Integers ====
The group of integers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; under addition, denoted &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{Z},+\right)&lt;/math&gt;, has been described above. The integers, with the operation of [[multiplication]] instead of addition, &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{Z},\cdot\right)&lt;/math&gt; do ''not'' form a group. The closure, associativity and identity axioms are satisfied, but inverses do not exist: for example, {{nowrap|1=''a'' = 2}} is an integer, but the only solution to the equation {{nowrap|1=''a · b'' = 1}} in this case is {{nowrap|1=''b'' = 1/2}}, which is a rational number, but not an integer. Hence not every element of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; has a (multiplicative) inverse.{{cref|k}}

==== Rationals ====
The desire for the existence of multiplicative inverses suggests considering [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]
:&lt;math alt="a/b"&gt;\frac{a}{b}.&lt;/math&gt;
Fractions of integers (with ''b'' nonzero) are known as [[rational number]]s.{{cref|l}} The set of all such irreducible fractions is commonly denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;. There is still a minor obstacle for &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{Q},\cdot\right)&lt;/math&gt;, the rationals with multiplication, being a group: because the rational number [[0 (number)|0]] does not have a multiplicative inverse (i.e., there is no ''x'' such that {{nowrap|1=''x'' · 0 = 1}}), &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{Q},\cdot\right)&lt;/math&gt; is still not a group.

However, the set of all ''nonzero'' rational numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}\setminus\left\{0\right\}=\left\{q\in\mathbb{Q}\mid q\neq 0\right\}&lt;/math&gt; does form an abelian group under multiplication, generally denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}^*&lt;/math&gt;.{{cref|m}} Associativity and identity element axioms follow from the properties of integers. The closure requirement still holds true after removing zero, because the product of two nonzero rationals is never zero. Finally, the inverse of ''a''/''b'' is ''b''/''a'', therefore the axiom of the inverse element is satisfied.

The rational numbers (including 0) also form a group under addition. Intertwining addition and multiplication operations yields more complicated structures called [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and—if division is possible, such as in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;—[[field (mathematics)|fields]], which occupy a central position in [[abstract algebra]]. Group theoretic arguments therefore underlie parts of the theory of those entities.{{cref|n}}

===Modular arithmetic===

[[File:Clock group.svg|thumb|right|The hours on a clock form a group that uses [[Modular arithmetic|addition modulo]] 12. Here 9 + 4 = 1.]]
In [[modular arithmetic]], two integers are added and then the sum is divided by a positive integer called the ''modulus.'' The result of modular addition is the [[remainder]] of that division. For any modulus, ''n'', the set of integers from 0 to {{nowrap|''n'' − 1}} forms a group under modular addition: the inverse of any element ''a'' is {{nowrap|''n'' − ''a''}}, and 0 is the identity element. This is familiar from the addition of hours on the face of a [[12-hour clock|clock]]: if the hour hand is on 9 and is advanced 4 hours, it ends up on 1, as shown at the right. This is expressed by saying that 9 + 4 equals 1 "modulo 12" or, in symbols,
:9 + 4 ≡ 1 modulo 12.
The group of integers modulo ''n'' is written &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{n}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

For any [[prime number]] ''p'', there is also the [[multiplicative group of integers modulo n|multiplicative group of integers modulo ''p'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = Chapter VII}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its elements are the integers 1 to {{nowrap|''p'' − 1}}. The group operation is multiplication modulo ''p''. That is, the usual product is divided by ''p'' and the remainder of this division is the result of modular multiplication. For example, if {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 5}}, there are four group elements 1, 2, 3, 4. In this group, {{nowrap|1=4 · 4 = 1}}, because the usual product 16 is equivalent to 1, which divided by 5 yields a remainder of 1.  for 5 divides {{nowrap|1=16 − 1 = 15}}, denoted
:16 ≡ 1 (mod 5).
The primality of ''p'' ensures that the product of two integers neither of which is divisible by ''p'' is not divisible by ''p'' either, hence the indicated set of classes is closed under multiplication.{{cref|o}} The identity element is 1, as usual for a multiplicative group, and the associativity follows from the corresponding property of integers. Finally, the inverse element axiom requires that given an integer ''a'' not divisible by ''p'', there exists an integer ''b'' such that
:''a''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1 (mod ''p''), i.e., ''p'' divides the difference {{nowrap|''a'' · ''b'' − 1}}.
The inverse ''b'' can be found by using [[Bézout's identity]] and the fact that the [[greatest common divisor]] {{nowrap|gcd(''a'', ''p'')}} equals 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Rosen|year = 2000|loc = p. 54 (Theorem 2.1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 5}} above, the inverse of 4 is 4, and the inverse of 3 is 2, as {{nowrap|1=3 · 2 = 6 ≡ 1 (mod 5)}}. Hence all group axioms are fulfilled. Actually, this example is similar to &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{Q}\setminus\left\{0\right\},\cdot\right)&lt;/math&gt; above: it consists of exactly those elements in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; that have a multiplicative inverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §VIII.1, p. 292}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups are denoted '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt;. They are crucial to [[public-key cryptography]].{{cref|p}}

===Cyclic groups===
{{Main|Cyclic group}}
[[Image:Cyclic group.svg|right|thumb|upright|The 6th complex roots of unity form a cyclic group. ''z'' is a primitive element, but ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is not, because the odd powers of ''z'' are not a power of ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.]]
A ''cyclic group'' is a group all of whose elements are [[power (mathematics)|powers]] of a particular element ''a''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.1, p. 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In multiplicative notation, the elements of the group are:
:..., ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e'', ''a'', ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, ...,
where ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; means ''a'' • ''a'', and ''a&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;'' stands for ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; • ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; • ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = (''a'' • ''a'' • ''a'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; etc.{{cref|h}} Such an element ''a'' is called a generator or a [[Primitive root modulo n|primitive element]] of the group. In additive notation, the requirement for an element to be primitive is that each element of the group can be written as
: ..., −''a''−''a'', −''a'', 0, ''a'', ''a''+''a'', ...

In the groups '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' introduced above, the element 1 is primitive, so these groups are cyclic. Indeed, each element is expressible as a sum all of whose terms are 1.  Any cyclic group with ''n'' elements is isomorphic to this group. A second example for cyclic groups is the group of [[root of unity|''n''-th complex roots of unity]], given by [[complex number]]s ''z'' satisfying {{nowrap|1=''z''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}. These numbers can be visualized as the vertices on a regular ''n''-gon, as shown in blue at the right for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 6}}. The group operation is multiplication of complex numbers. In the picture, multiplying with ''z'' corresponds to a [[clockwise|counter-clockwise]] rotation by 60°.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.2, p. 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using some [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], the group '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt; can be shown to be cyclic: for example, if {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 5}}, 3 is a generator since {{nowrap|1=3&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = 3}}, {{nowrap|1=3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9 ≡ 4}}, {{nowrap|3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 2}}, and {{nowrap|3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1}}.

Some cyclic groups have an infinite number of elements.  In these groups, for every non-zero element ''a'', all the powers of ''a'' are distinct; despite the name "cyclic group", the powers of the elements do not cycle. An infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to {{nowrap|('''Z''', +)}}, the group of integers under addition introduced above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.1, p. 22 (example 11)}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these two prototypes are both abelian, so is any cyclic group.

The study of finitely generated abelian groups is quite mature, including the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]]; and reflecting this state of affairs, many group-related notions, such as [[Center (group theory)|center]] and [[commutator]], describe the extent to which a given group is not abelian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = §I.5, p. 26, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symmetry groups===
{{Main|Symmetry group}}
{{see also|Molecular symmetry|Space group|Symmetry in physics}}
''Symmetry groups'' are groups consisting of [[symmetry|symmetries]] of given mathematical objects—be they of geometric nature, such as the introductory symmetry group of the square, or of algebraic nature, such as [[polynomial equation]]s and their solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Weyl|year = 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptually, group theory can be thought of as the study of symmetry.{{cref|t}} [[Symmetry in mathematics|Symmetries in mathematics]] greatly simplify the study of [[geometry|geometrical]] or [[analysis|analytical objects]]. A group is said to [[group action|act]] on another mathematical object ''X'' if every group element performs some operation on ''X'' compatibly to the group law. In the rightmost example below, an element of order 7 of the [[(2,3,7) triangle group]] acts on the tiling by permuting the highlighted warped triangles (and the other ones, too). By a group action, the group pattern is connected to the structure of the object being acted on.

[[Image:Sixteenth stellation of icosahedron.png|right|thumb|200px|Rotations and reflections form the symmetry group of a [[great icosahedron]].]]
In chemical fields, such as [[crystallography]], [[space group]]s and [[point group]]s describe [[molecular symmetry|molecular symmetries]] and crystal symmetries. These symmetries underlie the chemical and physical behavior of these systems, and group theory enables simplification of [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] analysis of these properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Conway|last2= Delgado Friedrichs|last3 = Huson|last4 = Thurston|year = 2001}}. See also {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Bishop|year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, group theory is used to show that optical transitions between certain quantum levels cannot occur simply because of the symmetry of the states involved.

Not only are groups useful to assess the implications of symmetries in molecules, but surprisingly they also predict that molecules sometimes can change symmetry. The [[Jahn-Teller effect]] is a distortion of a molecule of high symmetry when it adopts a particular ground state of lower symmetry from a set of possible ground states that are related to each other by the symmetry operations of the molecule.&lt;ref name=Bersuker&gt;{{citation |title=The Jahn-Teller Effect |first= Isaac |last= Bersuker |page=2 |isbn=0-521-82212-2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Jahn|last2=Teller|year = 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, group theory helps predict the changes in physical properties that occur when a material undergoes a [[phase transition]], for example, from a cubic to a tetrahedral crystalline form. An example is [[ferroelectric]] materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the [[Curie temperature]] and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectric state, accompanied by a so-called soft [[phonon]] mode, a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition.&lt;ref name=Dove&gt;{{citation |title=Structure and Dynamics: an atomic view of materials |first=Martin T|last= Dove |page=265 |isbn=0-19-850678-3 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] has found further application in elementary particle physics, where its occurrence is related to the appearance of [[Goldstone boson]]s.

Finite symmetry groups such as the [[Mathieu group]]s are used in [[coding theory]], which is in turn applied in [[forward error correction|error correction]] of transmitted data, and in [[CD player]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Welsh|year = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another application is [[differential Galois theory]], which characterizes functions having [[antiderivative]]s of a prescribed form, giving group-theoretic criteria for when solutions of certain [[differential equation]]s are well-behaved.{{cref|u}} Geometric properties that remain stable under group actions are investigated in [[geometric invariant theory|(geometric)]] [[invariant theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Mumford|last2 = Fogarty|last3 = Kirwan|year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General linear group and representation theory===
{{Main|General linear group|Representation theory}}
[[Image:Matrix multiplication.svg|right|thumb|250px|Two [[vector (mathematics)|vectors]] (the left illustration) multiplied by matrices (the middle and right illustrations). The middle illustration represents a clockwise rotation by 90°, while the right-most one stretches the ''x''-coordinate by factor 2.]]
[[Matrix group]]s consist of [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] together with [[matrix multiplication]]. The ''general linear group'' {{nowrap|GL(''n'', '''R''')}} consists of all [[invertible matrix|invertible]] ''n''-by-''n'' matrices with [[real number|real]] entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lay|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its subgroups are referred to as ''matrix groups'' or ''[[linear group]]s''. The dihedral group example mentioned above can be viewed as a (very small) matrix group. Another important matrix group is the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(''n''). It describes all possible rotations in ''n'' dimensions. Via [[Euler angles]], [[Rotation matrix|rotation matrices]] are used in [[computer graphics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Kuipers|year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Representation theory'' is both an application of the group concept and important for a deeper understanding of groups.&lt;ref name=FultonHarris&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Fulton|last2 = Harris|year = 1991|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Serre|year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; It studies the group by its [[group action]]s on other spaces. A broad class of [[group representation]]s are linear representations, i.e., the group is acting on a [[vector space]], such as the three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. A representation of ''G'' on an ''n''-[[dimension]]al real vector space is simply a group homomorphism
:''ρ'': ''G'' → GL(''n'', '''R''')
from the group to the general linear group. This way, the group operation, which may be abstractly given, translates to the multiplication of matrices making it accessible to explicit computations.{{cref|w}}

Given a group action, this gives further means to study the object being acted on.{{cref|x}} On the other hand, it also yields information about the group. Group representations are an organizing principle in the theory of finite groups, Lie groups, [[algebraic group]]s and [[topological group]]s, especially (locally) [[compact group]]s.&lt;ref name="FultonHarris"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Rudin|year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Galois groups ===
{{Main|Galois group}}
''Galois groups'' were developed to help solve [[polynomial equation]]s by capturing their symmetry features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Robinson|year = 1996|loc = p. viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Artin|year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the solutions of the [[quadratic equation]] {{nowrap|1=''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''bx'' + ''c'' = 0}} are given by
:&lt;math alt="x = (negative b plus or minus the squareroot of (b squared minus 4 a c)) over 2a"&gt;x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}.&lt;/math&gt;
Exchanging "+" and "−" in the expression, i.e., permuting the two solutions of the equation can be viewed as a (very simple) group operation. Similar formulae are known for [[cubic equation|cubic]] and [[quartic equation]]s, but do ''not'' exist in general for [[quintic equation|degree 5]] and higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = Chapter VI}} (see in particular p. 273 for concrete examples)&lt;/ref&gt; Abstract properties of Galois groups associated with polynomials (in particular their [[solvable group|solvability]]) give a criterion for polynomials that have all their solutions expressible by radicals, i.e., solutions expressible using solely addition, multiplication, and [[Nth root|roots]] similar to the formula above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = p. 292 (Theorem VI.7.2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem can be dealt with by shifting to [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]] and considering the [[splitting field]] of a polynomial.  Modern [[Galois theory]] generalizes the above type of Galois groups to [[field extension]]s and establishes—via the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]]—a precise relationship between fields and groups, underlining once again the ubiquity of groups in mathematics.

== Finite groups ==
{{Main|Finite group}}
A group is called ''finite'' if it has a [[finite set|finite number of elements]]. The number of elements is called the [[order (group theory)|order]] of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Kurzweil|last2= Stellmacher|year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An important class is the ''[[symmetric group]]s'' S&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;, the groups of [[permutation]]s of ''N'' letters. For example, the symmetric group on 3 letters [[dihedral group of order 6|S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] is the group consisting of all possible orderings of the three letters ''ABC'', i.e., contains the elements ''ABC'', ''ACB'', ''BAC'', ''BCA'', ''CAB'', ''CBA'', in total 6 ([[factorial]] of 3) elements. This class is fundamental insofar as any finite group can be expressed as a subgroup of a symmetric group S&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; for a suitable integer ''N'', according to [[Cayley's theorem]]. Parallel to the group of symmetries of the square above, S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can also be interpreted as the group of symmetries of an [[equilateral triangle]].

The order of an element ''a'' in a group ''G'' is the least positive integer ''n'' such that ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''e'', where ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; represents

: &lt;math&gt;\underbrace{a \cdots a}_{n \text{ factors}},&lt;/math&gt;

i.e., application of the operation • to ''n'' copies of ''a''. (If • represents multiplication, then ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; corresponds to the ''n''th power of ''a''.) In infinite groups, such an ''n'' may not exist, in which case the order of ''a'' is said to be infinity. The order of an element equals the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by this element.

More sophisticated counting techniques, for example counting cosets, yield more precise statements about finite groups: [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's Theorem]] states that for a finite group ''G'' the order of any finite subgroup ''H'' [[divisor|divides]] the order of ''G''. The [[Sylow theorems]] give a partial converse.

The [[dihedral group]] (discussed above) is a finite group of order 8. The order of r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is 4, as is the order of the subgroup ''R'' it generates (see above). The order of the reflection elements f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; etc. is 2. Both orders divide 8, as predicted by Lagrange's theorem. The groups '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt; above have order {{nowrap|''p'' − 1}}.

=== Classification of finite simple groups ===
{{Main|Classification of finite simple groups}}
Mathematicians often strive for a complete [[classification theorems|classification]] (or list) of a mathematical notion. In the context of finite groups, this aim leads to difficult mathematics. According to Lagrange's theorem, finite groups of order ''p'', a prime number, are necessarily cyclic (abelian) groups '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;. Groups of order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can also be shown to be abelian, a statement which does not generalize to order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, as the non-abelian group D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of order 8 = 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; above shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Artin|year = 1991|loc = Theorem 6.1.14}}. See also {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = p. 77}} for similar results.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computer algebra system]]s can be used to [[List of small groups|list small groups]], but there is no classification of all finite groups.{{cref|q}} An intermediate step is the classification of finite simple groups.{{cref|r}} A nontrivial group is called ''[[simple group|simple]]'' if its only normal subgroups are the [[trivial group]] and the group itself.{{cref|s}} The [[Jordan–Hölder theorem]] exhibits finite simple groups as the building blocks for all finite groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = §I. 3, p. 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of finite simple groups|Listing all finite simple groups]] was a major achievement in contemporary group theory. 1998 [[Fields Medal]] winner [[Richard Borcherds]] succeeded in proving the [[monstrous moonshine]] conjectures, a surprising and deep relation between the largest finite simple [[sporadic group]]—the "[[monster group]]"—and certain [[modular function]]s, a piece of classical [[complex analysis]], and [[string theory]], a theory supposed to unify the description of many physical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Ronan|year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Groups with additional structure==
Many groups are simultaneously groups and examples of other mathematical structures. In the language of [[category theory]], they are [[group object]]s in a [[category (mathematics)|category]], meaning that they are objects (that is, examples of another mathematical structure) which come with transformations (called [[morphism]]s) that mimic the group axioms. For example, every group (as defined above) is also a set, so a group is a group object in the [[category of sets]].

===Topological groups===
[[Image:Circle as Lie group2.svg|right|thumb|The [[unit circle]] in the [[complex plane]] under complex multiplication is a Lie group and, therefore, a topological group. It is topological since complex multiplication and division are continuous. It is a manifold and thus a Lie group, because every [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|small piece]], such as the red arc in the figure, looks like a part of the [[real line]] (shown at the bottom). ]]
{{Main|Topological group}}
Some [[topological space]]s may be endowed with a group law. In order for the group law and the topology to interweave well, the group operations must be [[continuous function]]s, that is, {{nowrap|''g'' • ''h''}}, and ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; must not vary wildly if ''g'' and ''h'' vary only little. Such groups are called ''topological groups,'' and they are the group objects in the [[category of topological spaces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes| last = Husain|year = 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most basic examples are the [[real number|reals]] '''R''' under addition, {{nowrap|('''R''' ∖ {0}, ·)}}, and similarly with any other [[topological field]] such as the [[complex number]]s or [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]]. All of these groups are [[locally compact topological group|locally compact]], so they have [[Haar measure]]s and can be studied via [[harmonic analysis]]. The former offer an abstract formalism of invariant [[integral]]s. [[Invariant (mathematics)|Invariance]] means, in the case of real numbers for example:
: &lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x)\,dx = \int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x+c)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
for any constant ''c''. Matrix groups over these fields fall under this regime, as do [[adele ring]]s and [[adelic algebraic group]]s, which are basic to number theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes| last = Neukirch|year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galois groups of infinite field extensions such as the [[absolute Galois group]] can also be equipped with a topology, the so-called [[Krull topology]], which in turn is central to generalize the above sketched connection of fields and groups to infinite field extensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes| last = Shatz|year = 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; An advanced generalization of this idea, adapted to the needs of [[algebraic geometry]], is the [[étale fundamental group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes| last = Milne|year = 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lie groups===
{{Main|Lie group}}
''Lie groups'' (in honor of [[Sophus Lie]]) are groups which also have a [[manifold]] structure, i.e., they are spaces [[diffeomorphism|looking locally like]] some [[Euclidean space]] of the appropriate [[dimension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Warner|year = 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, the additional structure, here the manifold structure, has to be compatible, i.e., the maps corresponding to multiplication and the inverse have to be [[smooth map|smooth]].

A standard example is the general linear group introduced above: it is an [[open subset]] of the space of all ''n''-by-''n'' matrices, because it is given by the inequality
:det (''A'') ≠ 0,
where ''A'' denotes an ''n''-by-''n'' matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Borel|year = 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lie groups are of fundamental importance in modern physics: [[Noether's theorem]] links continuous symmetries to [[conserved quantities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Goldstein|year = 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rotation]], as well as [[translation (geometry)|translations]] in [[space]] and [[time]] are basic symmetries of the laws of [[mechanics]]. They can, for instance, be used to construct simple models—imposing, say, axial symmetry on a situation will typically lead to significant simplification in the equations one needs to solve to provide a physical description.{{cref|v}} Another example are the [[Lorentz transformation]]s, which relate measurements of time and velocity of two observers in motion relative to each other. They can be deduced in a purely group-theoretical way, by expressing the transformations as a rotational symmetry of [[Minkowski space]]. The latter serves—in the absence of significant [[gravitation]]—as a model of [[space time]] in [[special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citations|nb=yes|last=Weinberg|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full symmetry group of Minkowski space, i.e., including translations, is known as the [[Poincaré group]]. By the above, it plays a pivotal role in special relativity and, by implication, for [[quantum field theories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Naber|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Local symmetry|Symmetries that vary with location]] are central to the modern description of physical interactions with the help of [[gauge theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes| last = Becchi|year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations==
{{Group-like structures}}
In [[abstract algebra]], more general structures are defined by relaxing some of the axioms defining a group.&lt;ref name="MacLane"&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Mac Lane|year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Denecke|last2 = Wismath|year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Romanowska|last2 = Smith|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the requirement that every element has an inverse is eliminated, the resulting algebraic structure is called a [[monoid]]. The [[natural number]]s '''N''' (including 0) under addition form a monoid, as do the nonzero integers under multiplication {{nowrap|('''Z''' ∖ {0}, ·)}}, see above. There is a general method to formally add inverses to elements to any (abelian) monoid, much the same way as {{nowrap|('''Q''' ∖ {0}, ·)}} is derived from {{nowrap|('''Z''' ∖ {0}, ·)}}, known as the [[Grothendieck group]].
[[Groupoid]]s are similar to groups except that the composition {{nowrap|''a'' • ''b''}} need not be defined for all ''a'' and ''b''. They arise in the study of more complicated forms of symmetry, often in [[topology|topological]] and [[mathematical analysis|analytical]] structures, such as the [[fundamental groupoid]] or [[stack (mathematics)|stacks]]. Finally, it is possible to generalize any of these concepts by replacing the binary operation with an arbitrary [[arity|''n''-ary]] one (i.e., an operation taking ''n'' arguments). With the proper generalization of the group axioms this gives rise to an [[n-ary group|''n''-ary group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Dudek|year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The table gives a list of several structures generalizing groups.

A '''hate crime''' (also known as a '''bias-motivated crime''' or '''bias crime'''&lt;ref&gt;{cite web| url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/hate-crime|website=Dictionary.com|quote="Also called '''bias crime'''."}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[prejudice]]-motivated crime which occurs when a perpetrator targets a victim because of his or her membership (or perceived membership) in a certain [[social group]] or [[race (human categorization)|race]].  

Examples of such groups can include and are almost exclusively limited to: [[sex]], [[ethnicity]], [[disability]], [[language]], [[nationality]], [[Physical appearance#Physiological differences|physical appearance]], [[religion]], [[gender identity]] or [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stotzer|first=R.|url=http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Stotzer-Comparison-Hate-Crime-June-2007.pdf|format=PDF|title=Comparison of Hate Crime Rates Across Protected and Unprotected Groups|work= [[Williams Institute]]|date= June 2007|accessdate=2012-03-17}} "A hate crime or bias motivated crime occurs when the perpetrator of the crime intentionally selects the victim because of his or her membership in a certain group."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FBI2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2013/resource-pages/methodology/methodology_final|title=Methodology|work=FBI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Streis"&gt;Streissguth, Tom (2003). ''Hate Crimes'' (Library in a Book), p. 3. {{ISBN|0-8160-4879-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-criminal actions that are motivated by these reasons are often called "[[bias incident]]s".

"Hate crime" generally refers to [[crime|criminal acts]] which are seen to have been motivated by [[bias]] against one or more of the social groups listed above, or by bias against their derivatives. Incidents may involve physical assault, damage to property, [[bullying]], [[harassment]], [[verbal abuse]] or [[insult]]s, [[mate crime]] or offensive [[graffiti]] or letters ([[hate mail]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/reducing-crime/hate-crime/|title=Home Office {{!}} Hate crime|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126153146/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/reducing-crime/hate-crime/|archive-date=26 November 2005|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hate speech laws exist in many countries. In the United States, hate crime laws have been upheld by both the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] &lt;ref&gt;''[[Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire]]'', 315 U.S. 568, 572 (1942)&lt;/ref&gt; and lower courts, especially in the case of [[Fighting words|'fighting' words]] and other violent speech, but they are thought by some people to be in conflict with the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to [[freedom of speech]], but hate crimes are only regulated through threats of injury or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/do-hate-crime-laws-violate-first-amendment.html|title=Do Hate Crime Laws Violate the First Amendment?|work=www.criminaldefenselawyer.com|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "hate crime" came into common usage in the United States during the 1980s, but the term is often used retrospectively in order to describe events which occurred prior to that era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/civilrights/hate_crimes|title=Hate Crimes|work=FBI|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the Roman [[persecution of Christians]] to the [[Final Solution|Nazi slaughter of Jews]], hate crimes were committed by both individuals and governments long before the term was commonly used.&lt;ref name="Streis"/&gt;

As [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] began to [[colonialism|colonize]] the world from the 16th century onwards, [[indigenous peoples]] in the colonized areas, such as [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] increasingly became the targets of bias-motivated [[intimidation]] and [[violence]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2016}} During the past two centuries, typical examples of hate crimes in the U.S. include [[lynching]]s of [[African Americans]], largely in the [[Southern United States|South]], and lynchings of [[Mexican Americans|Mexicans]] and [[Chinese Americans|Chinese]] in the [[Western United States|West]]; [[cross burning]]s to intimidate black activists or to drive black families from predominantly white neighborhoods both during and after [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]; [[assault]]s on [[white people]] traveling in predominantly black neighborhoods; assaults on [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] people; the painting of [[swastika]]s on Jewish [[synagogue]]s; and [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] responses to a variety of [[minorities|minority]] [[ethnic group]]s.&lt;ref name = "tvccce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bja/162304.pdf |title=A Policymaker's Guide to Hate Crimes |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Duluth-lynching-postcard.jpg|thumb|Postcard of the [[1920 Duluth lynchings|Duluth lynchings]] of African-American men on June 15, 1920]]

The verb "''to [[Lynching|lynch]]''" is attributed to the actions of [[Charles Lynch (jurist)|Charles Lynch]], an 18th-century [[Virginia]] [[Quaker]]. Lynch, other militia officers, and justices of the peace rounded up [[Tory]] sympathizers who were given a summary trial at an informal court; sentences handed down included whipping, property seizure, coerced pledges of allegiance, and conscription into the military. Originally, the term referred to extrajudicial organized but unauthorized punishment of criminals. It later evolved to describe execution outside "ordinary justice." It is highly associated with white suppression of African Americans in the South, and periods of weak or nonexistent [[police authority]], as in certain frontier areas of the [[Old West]].&lt;ref name="Streis"/&gt;

The [[murders of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom]] and the [[Wichita Massacre]] were not classified as "hate crimes" by U.S. investigative officials or the media. In the early 21st century, conservative commentators [[David Horowitz]], [[Michelle Malkin]] ([[Fox News]] channel and author) and [[Stuart Taylor Jr.]] (journalist) did describe these events as "hate crimes against whites by blacks."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/05/hate-crimes-and-double-standards/305992/ Stuart Taylor, Jr. "'Hate Crimes' and Double Standards"], ''[[The Atlantic]],'' 29 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Hate crimes can have significant and wide-ranging [[Psychology|psychological]] consequences, not only for their direct victims but for others as well. A 1999 U.S. study of lesbian and gay victims of violent hate crimes documented that they experienced higher levels of psychological distress, including symptoms of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]], than lesbian and gay victims of comparable crimes which were not motivated by antigay bias.&lt;ref

; Impact on the individual victim: psychological and [[affection|affective]] disturbances; repercussions on the victim's identity and [[self-esteem]]; both reinforced by a specific hate crime's degree of violence, which is usually stronger than that of a common crime.
; Effect on the targeted group: generalized [[fear|terror]] in the group to which the victim belongs, inspiring feelings of vulnerability among its other members, who could be the next hate crime victims.
; Effect on other vulnerable groups: ominous effects on [[minority groups]] or on groups that identify themselves with the targeted group, especially when the referred hate is based on an [[ideology]] or a [[doctrine]] that preaches simultaneously against several groups.
; Effect on the community as a whole: divisions and factionalism arising in response to hate crimes are particularly damaging to [[multiculturalism|multicultural societies]].

Hate crime victims can also develop depression and [[psychological trauma]].&lt;ref

==Laws==
Hate crime laws generally fall into one of several categories:
# laws defining specific bias-motivated acts as distinct crimes;
# criminal penalty-enhancement laws;
# laws creating a distinct civil cause of action for hate crimes; and
# laws requiring administrative agencies to collect hate crime statistics.&lt;ref name="human"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/everyday-fears-080805.pdf |title=Michael McClintock: ''Everyday Fears: A Survey of Violent Hate Crimes in Europe and North America'' |publisher=Humanrightsfirst.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes (as in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]), the laws focus on [[war crimes]], [[genocide]], and [[crimes against humanity]] with the prohibition against discriminatory action limited to public officials.

====European Union====
Since 2002, with an amendment to the [[Convention on Cybercrime]], the [[European Union]] mandates individual states to punish as a crime [[hate speech]] done through the [[internet]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ibls.com/internet_law_news_portal_view.aspx?s=latestnews&amp;id=2422 Arias, Martha L.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Andorra====
Discriminatory acts constituting harassment or infringement of a person's dignity on the basis of origin, citizenship, race, religion, or gender (Penal Code Article 313). Courts have cited bias-based motivation in delivering sentences, but there is no explicit penalty enhancement provision in the Criminal Code. The government does not track hate crime statistics, although they are relatively rare.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Belgium====
[[Belgium]]'s Act of 25 February 2003 ("aimed at combating discrimination and modifying the Act of 15 February 1993 which establishes the Centre for Equal Opportunities and the Fight against Racism") establishes a penalty-enhancement for crimes involving discrimination on the basis of gender, supposed race, color, descent, national or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, civil status, birth, fortune, age, religious or philosophical beliefs, current or future state of health and handicap or physical features. The Act also "provides for a civil remedy to address discrimination."&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;  The Act, along with the Act of 20 January 2003 ("on strengthening legislation against racism"), requires the Centre to collect and publish statistical data on racism and discriminatory crimes.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====
The Criminal Code of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (enacted 2003) "contains provisions prohibiting discrimination by public officials on grounds, inter alia, of race, skin colour, national or ethnic background, religion and language and prohibiting the restriction by public officials of the language rights of the citizens in their relations with the authorities (Article 145/1 and 145/2)."&lt;ref&gt;Office of the High Representative, [http://www.ohr.int/decisions/judicialrdec/doc/HiRep-dec-101-law-crim-code-bih.doc Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina], January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bulgaria]]n criminal law prohibits certain crimes motivated by racism and [[xenophobia]], but a 1999 report by the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] found that it does not appear that those provisions "have ever resulted in convictions before the courts in Bulgaria."&lt;ref&gt;ECRI, "Second Report on Bulgaria", adopted on June 18, 1999, and made public on March 21, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Croatia====
The [[Croatia]]n Penal Code explicitly defines hate crime in article 89 as "any crime committed out of hatred for someone's race, skin color, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other belief, national or social background, asset, birth, education, social condition, age, health condition or other attribute".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2006_06_71_1706.html |title=71 28.6.2006 Zakon o izmjenama i dopunama Kaznenog zakona |publisher=Narodne-novine.nn.hr |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 January 2013, a new Penal Code was introduced with the recognition of a hate crime based on "race, skin color, religion, national or ethnic background, sexual orientation or gender identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ravnopravnost.hr/web/184/ |title=Centar za LGBT ravnopravnost » Vlada prihvatila prijedloge Centra za LGBT ravnopravnost |publisher=Ravnopravnost.hr |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331011308/http://www.ravnopravnost.hr/web/184/ |archivedate=2012-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Czech Republic====
The Czech legislation finds its constitutional basis in the principles of equality and non-discrimination contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms. From there, we can trace two basic lines of protection against hate-motivated incidents: one passes through criminal law, the other through civil law.
The current Czech criminal legislation has implications both for decisions about guilt (affecting the decision whether to find a defendant guilty or not guilty) and decisions concerning sentencing (affecting the extent of the punishment imposed). It has '''three levels''', to wit:
* a '''circumstance determining whether an act is a crime''' – hate motivation is included in the basic constituent elements. If hate motivation is not proven, conviction for a hate crime is not possible.
* a '''circumstance determining the imposition of a higher penalty''' – a hate motivation is included in the qualified constituent elements for some types of crimes (murder, bodily harm). If hate motivation is not proven, the penalty is imposed according to the scale specified for the basic constituent elements of the crime.
* '''general aggravating circumstance''' – the court is obligated to take the hate motivation into account as a general aggravating circumstance and determines the amount of penalty to impose. Nevertheless, it is not possible to add together a general aggravating circumstance and a circumstance determining the imposition of a higher penalty. (see Annex for details)
Current criminal legislation '''does not provide for special penalties''' for acts that target another by reason of his '''sexual orientation, age or health status'''. Only the constituent elements of the criminal offense of Incitement to hatred towards a group of persons or to the curtailment of their rights and freedoms, and general aggravating circumstances include attacking a so-called different group of people. Such a group of people can then, of course, be also one defined by sexual orientation, age or health status. A certain disparity has thus been created between, on the one hand, those groups of people who are victimized by reason of their skin color, faith, nationality, ethnicity or political persuasion and enjoy increased protection, and, on the other hand, those groups that are victimized by reason of their sexual orientation, age or health status and are not granted increased protection. This gap in protection against attacks motivated by the victim's sexual orientation, age or health status cannot be successfully bridged by interpretation. Interpretation by analogy is inadmissible in criminal law, sanctionable motivations being exhaustively enumerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in-ius.cz/dwn/zprava-o-nzn2011/report-web.pdf |title=Zpráva o násilí z nenávisti v České republice za rok 2011 |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denmark====
Although [[Denmark|Danish]] law does not include explicit hate crime provisions, "section 80(1) of the Criminal Code instructs courts to take into account the gravity of the offence and the offender's motive when meting out penalty, and therefore to attach importance to the racist motive of crimes in determining sentence."&lt;ref&gt;ECRI, “Second Report on Denmark,” adopted on June 16, 2000, and made public on April 3, 2001, para. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years judges have used this provision to increase sentences on the basis of racist motives.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chahrokh, Klug, and Bilger, Migrants, Minorities, and Legislation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1992, the Danish Civil Security Service (PET) has released statistics on crimes with apparent racist motivation.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Estonia====
Under section 151 of the Criminal Code of [[Estonia]] of 6 June 2001, which entered into force on 1 September 2002, with amendments and supplements and as amended by the Law of 8 December 2011, "activities which publicly incite to hatred, violence or discrimination on the basis of nationality, race, colour, sex, language, origin, religion, sexual orientation, political opinion, or financial or social status, if this results in danger to the life, health or property of a person, are punishable by a fine of up to 300 fine units or by detention".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislationline.org/documents/action/popup/id/18762 Criminal Code of Estonia of 6 June 2001, entered into force on 1 September 2002, with amendments and supplements and latest amendment by the Law of 8 December 2011, published in RT I, 29.12.2011, 1 and entered into force on 1 January 2012 (excerpts)], accessed 27 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

====Finland====
[[Finland|Finnish]] [[Criminal Code of Finland|Criminal Code]] 515/2003 (enacted January 31, 2003) makes "committing a crime against a person, because of his national, racial, ethnical or equivalent group" an aggravating circumstance in sentencing.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EUMC, “Racism and xenophobia in the E.U.,” p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ethnic agitation ({{lang-fi|kiihotus kansanryhmää vastaan}}) is criminalized and carries a fine or a prison sentence of not more than two years. The prosecution need not prove that an actual danger to an ethnic group is caused but only that malicious message is conveyed. A more aggravated hate crime, warmongering ({{lang-fi|sotaan yllyttäminen}}), carries a prison sentence of one to ten years. However, in case of warmongering, the prosecution must prove an [[overt act]] that evidently increases the risk that Finland is involved in a war or becomes a target for a military operation. The act in question may consist of
# illegal violence directed against a foreign country or its citizens,
# systematic dissemination of false information on Finnish foreign policy or defense
# public influence on the public opinion towards a pro-war viewpoint or
# public suggestion that a foreign country or Finland should engage in an aggressive act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039.pdf Penal Code (39/1889)] as of 1006/2004. §§ 6:5.1.4 (ethnic hatred as an aggravating factor), 11:8 (ethnic agitation) and 12:2 (warmongering).

====France====
In 2003, France enacted penalty-enhancement hate crime laws for crimes motivated by bias against the victim's actual or perceived ethnicity, nation, race, religion, or sexual orientation. The penalties for murder were raised from 30 years (for non-hate crimes) to life imprisonment (for hate crimes), and the penalties for violent attacks leading to permanent disability were raised from 10 years (for non-hate crimes) to 15 years (for hate crimes).&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000781920 Loi n° 2003–88 du 3 février 2003 visant à aggraver les peines punissant les infractions à caractère raciste, antisémite ou xénophobe]''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Georgia====
"There is no general provision in Georgian law for racist motivation to be considered an aggravating circumstance in prosecutions of ordinary offenses. Certain crimes involving racist motivation are, however, defined as specific offenses in the Georgian Criminal Code of 1999, including murder motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 109); infliction of serious
injuries motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 117); and torture motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 126). ECRI reported no knowledge of cases in which this law has been enforced. There is no systematic monitoring or data collection on discrimination in Georgia."&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Germany====
The [[German Criminal Code]] does not have hate crime legislation, but instead criminalizes [[hate speech]] under a number of different laws, including [[Volksverhetzung]]. In the German legal framework [[motivation]] is not taken into account while identifying the element of the offence. However, within the sentencing procedure the judge can define certain principles for determining punishment. In section 46 of the German Criminal Code it is stated that "the motives and aims of the perpetrator; the state of mind reflected in the act and the willfulness involved in its commission."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/StGB.htm#46 |title=Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch, StGB) |publisher=Iuscomp.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be taken into consideration when determining the [[punishment]]; under this statute, hate and bias have been taken into consideration in sentencing in past cases.&lt;ref name="Marc Coester 2008"&gt;Marc Coester (2008): Das Konzept der Hate Crimes aus den USA unter besonderer Berücksichtigung des Rechtsextremismus in Deutschland.

in Ukraine, all criminal punishments for crimes committed under the law are required to be registered in only one law, it is the only one: "CRIMINAL CODEX OF UKRAINE"

The crimes committed for Hate crime reinforce the punishment in many articles of the criminal law. There are also separate articles on punishment for Hate crime.

"CRIMINAL CODEX OF UKRAINE"  :

Article 161 : "Violations of equality of citizens depending on their race, nationality, religious beliefs, disability and other grounds

1. Intentional acts aimed at incitement to national, racial or religious hatred and violence, to humiliate national honor and dignity, or to repulse citizens' feelings due to their religious beliefs, as well as direct or indirect restriction of rights or the establishment of direct or indirect privileges citizens on the grounds of race, color, political, religious or other beliefs, sex, disability, ethnic or social origin, property status, place of residence, language or other grounds"(Maximum criminal sentence of up to 8 years in prison)

====United Kingdom====
For [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Scotland]], the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]] makes hateful behaviour towards a victim based on the victim's membership (or presumed membership) in a racial group or a religious group an [[aggravation (legal concept)|aggravation]] in [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] for specified crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/37/contents|title=Crime and Disorder Act 1998|work=legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]] (c. 24) amended sections of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/ukpga_20010024_en_5|title=Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Northern Ireland]], Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 (S.I. 1987/463 (N.I. 7)) serves the same purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1987/Uksi_19870463_en_1.htm|title=Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "racial group" is a group of persons defined by reference to race, colour, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origins. A "religious group" is a group of persons defined by reference to religious belief or lack of religious belief. The specified crimes are assault, criminal damage, offences under the [[Public Order Act 1986]], and offences under the [[Protection from Harassment Act 1997]].

Sections 145 and 146 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] require a court to consider whether a crime which is not specified by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 is racially or religiously aggravated, and to consider whether the following circumstances were pertinent to the crime:
:(a) that, at the time of committing the offence, or immediately before or after doing so, the offender demonstrated towards the victim of the offence hostility based on—
::(i) the sexual orientation (or presumed sexual orientation) of the victim, or
::(ii) a disability (or presumed disability) of the victim, or
:(b) that the offence is motivated (wholly or partly)—
::(i) by hostility towards persons who are of a particular sexual orientation, or
::(ii) by hostility towards persons who have a disability or a particular disability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030044_en_14#pt12-ch1-pb1-l1g145 Sections 145 and 146 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Hate crime" legislation is distinct from "hate speech" legislation.

The [[Crime Survey for England and Wales]] (CSEW) reported in 2013 that there are an average of 278,000 hate crimes a year with 40% being reported according to a victims survey, although police records only identified around 43,000 hate crimes a year.&lt;ref&gt;Arnett, G., [https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/dec/17/how-prevalent-hate-crime-england-wales Hate crime in England and Wales: how prevalent is it?], ''The Guardian'', 17 December 2013, accessed 29 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely reported that police recorded a 57% increase in hate crime complaints in the four days following the UK's [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|European Union membership referendum]], however a press release from the National Police Chief's Council stated that "this should not be read as a national increase in hate crime of 57 per cent”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/27/sadiq-khan-muslim-council-britain-warning-of-post-brexit-racism Cameron condemns xenophobic and racist abuse after Brexit vote], ''The Guardian'' 27 June 2016, accessed 29 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.npcc.police.uk/releases/hate-crime-is-unacceptable-in-any-circumstances-say-police|title=Hate crime is unacceptable in any circumstances say police |work=''National Police Chief's Council'' |date=27 June 2016|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 4, 2013 [[Essex Police]] launched the ‘Stop the Hate’ initiative as part of a concerted effort to find new ways to tackle hate crime in Essex. The launch was marked by a conference in [[Chelmsford]], hosted by Chief Constable Stephen Kavanagh, which brought together 220 delegates from a range of partner organisations involved in the field. The theme of the conference was ‘Report it to Sort it’ and the emphasis was on encouraging people to tell police if they have been a victim of hate crime, whether it be based on race, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity or disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopthehate.org.uk/2013/12/launch-of-stop-the-hate-initiative |title=Launch of ‘Stop the Hate’ initiative |publisher=Stop the hate |date=2013-12-04 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crown Prosecution Service]] guidance issued on 21 August 2017 stated that online hate crimes should be treated as seriously as offences in person.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40981235 Hate crimes: Fresh guidance on online offences], accessed 21 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most high-profile hate crime in modern Britain occurred in [[Eltham]], [[London]], on 24 April 1993, when 18-year-old black student [[Stephen Lawrence]] was stabbed to death in an attack by a gang of white youths. Two white teenagers were later charged with the murder, and at least three other suspects were mentioned in the national media, but the charges against them were dropped within three months after the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute. However, a change in the law a decade later allowed a suspect to be charged with a crime twice if new evidence emerged after the original charges were dropped or a "not guilty" verdict was delivered in court. Gary Dobson, who had been charged with the murder in the initial 1993 investigation, was found guilty of Stephen Lawrence's murder in January 2012 and sentenced to life imprisonment, as was David Norris, who had not been charged in 1993. A third suspect, Luke Knight, had been charged in 1993 but was not charged when the case came to court nearly 20 years later.

=====Scotland=====
Under [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Scots law#Common law|Common law]]{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} the courts can take any aggravating factor into account when sentencing someone found guilty of an offence. There is legislation dealing with the offences of incitement of racial hatred, racially aggravated harassment, prejudice relating to religious beliefs, disability, sexual orientation, and transgender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2009/8/contents?section-1-7|title=Offences (Aggravation by Prejudice) (Scotland) Act 2009|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Scottish Executive]] working group examined the issue of hate crime and ways of combating crime motivated by social prejudice, reporting in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/criminal/17543/8978] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012191951/http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/criminal/17543/8978|date=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main recommendations were not implemented, but in their manifestos for the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007]] several political parties included commitments to legislate in this area, including the [[Scottish National Party]] who now form the Scottish Government.  The Offences (Aggravation by Prejudice) (Scotland) Bill was introduced on 19 May 2008 by [[Patrick Harvie]] MSP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/s3/bills/09-AggPrej/index.htm |title=Offences (Aggravation by Prejudice) (Scotland) Bill |publisher=Scottish.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825214959/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/s3/bills/09-AggPrej/index.htm |archivedate=2011-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  having been prepared with support from the Scottish Government, and was passed unanimously by the [[Scottish Parliament|parliament]] on 3 June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8078988.stm MSPs approve new hate crime laws] BBC News 3 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eurasian countries with no hate crime laws====

===North America===

====Canada====
"In Canada the legal definition of hate crime can be found in sections 318 and 319 of the Criminal Code".
&lt;ref name="autogenerated161"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Grady|first=William|title=Crime In Canadian Context: debates and controversies|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-543378-4|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 the federal government amended a section of the Criminal Code that pertains to sentencing. Specifically, section 718.2. The section states (with regard to the hate crime):

''A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:

''(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,''

''(i) evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other similar factor, . . . shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances.''''
&lt;ref name="autogenerated161"/&gt;

A vast majority (84 per cent) of hate crime perpetrators were "male, with an average age of just under 30. Less than 10 of those accused had criminal records, and less than 5 per cent had previous hate crime involvement (ibid O’Grady 2010 page 163.)."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Grady|first=William|title=Crime In Canadian Context: debates and controversies|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-543378-4|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Only 4 percent of hate crimes were linked to an organized or extremist group (Silver et al., 2004)."
&lt;ref name="autogenerated162"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Grady|first=William|title=Crime In Canadian Context: debates and controversies|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-543378-4|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2004, Jewish people were the largest ethnic group targeted by hate crimes, followed by blacks, Muslims, South Asians, and homosexuals (Silver et al., 2004).&lt;ref name="autogenerated162"/&gt;

During the Nazi regime, anti-Semitism was a cause of hate related violence in Canada. For example, on August 16, 1933 there was a baseball game in Toronto and one team was made up of mostly Jewish players. At the end of the game, a group of Nazi sympathizers unfolded a Swastika flag and shouted ‘Heil Hitler’. That event [[Christie Pits riot|erupted into a brawl]] that had Jews and Italians against Anglo Canadians and the brawl went on for hours.&lt;ref name="autogenerated161"/&gt;

The first time someone was charged with hate speech over the internet occurred on 27 March 1996. "A Winnipeg teenager was arrested by the police for sending an email to a local political activist that contained the message ‘Death to homosexuals’ it's prescribed in the Bible! Better watch out next Gay Pride Week.’ (Nairne, 1996)."&lt;ref name="autogenerated162"/&gt;

Hate crime laws have a long history in the United States. The first hate crime&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015/topic-pages/incidentsandoffenses_final.pdf|title=Hate Crime Statistics, 2015|last=|first=|date=Fall 2016|website=ucr.fbi.gov|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; laws were passed after the [[American Civil War]], beginning with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]], to combat the growing number of racially motivated crimes being committed by the Reconstruction era [[Ku Klux Klan]]. The modern era of hate-crime legislation began in 1968 with the passage of federal statute, 18 U.S. 245, part of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968|Civil Rights Act]] which made it illegal to "by force or by threat of force, injure, intimidate, or interfere with anyone who is engaged in six specified protected activities, by reason of their [[race (classification of humans)|race]], [[color]], [[religion]], or [[national origin]]." However, "The prosecution of such crimes must be certified by the U.S. attorney general.".&lt;ref&gt;Streissguth (2003), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first state hate-crime statute, California's Section 190.2, was passed in 1978 and provided for penalty enhancement in cases where murder was motivated by prejudice against four "protected status" categories: race, religion, color, and national origin. Washington included [[ancestry]] in a statute passed in 1981. Alaska included [[creed]] and [[sex]] in 1982 and later [[disability]], [[sexual orientation]], and [[ethnicity]]. In the 1990s some state laws began to include [[ageing|age]], [[marital status]], membership in the [[armed forces]], and membership in [[civil rights]] organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Streissguth (2003), pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal acts which could be considered hate crimes in various states included [[aggravated assault]], [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]], [[vandalism]], [[rape]], [[threat]]s and [[intimidation]], [[arson]], [[trespassing]], [[stalking]], and various "lesser" acts until in 1987 California state legislation included all crimes as possible hate crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Streissguth (2003), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Defined in the 1999 National Crime Victim Survey, "A hate crime is a criminal offense. In the [[United States]], federal prosecution is possible for hate crimes committed on the basis of a person's race, religion, or nation origin when engaging in a federally protected activity." In 2009, the [[Matthew Shepard Act]] added actual or perceived [[gender]], [[gender identity]], [[sexual orientation]], and [[disability]] to the federal definition, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity.

Forty-five states and the [[District of Columbia]] have statutes criminalizing various types of hate crimes. Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia have statutes creating a [[Legal liability|civil cause of action]] in addition to the criminal penalty for similar acts. Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have statutes requiring the state to collect hate crime statistics.&lt;ref name="adl"&gt;[http://www.adl.org/99hatecrime/state_hate_crime_laws.pdf State Hate Crime Laws] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614124916/http://www.adl.org/99hatecrime/state_hate_crime_laws.pdf |date=2007-06-14 }}, [[Anti-Defamation League]], June 2006.

According to the [[FBI]] Hate Crime Statistics report for 2006, hate crimes increased nearly 8% nationwide, with a total of 7,722 incidents and 9,080 offenses reported by participating law enforcement agencies.  Of the 5,449 crimes against persons, 46% were classified as intimidation and 32% as simple assaults. 81% of the 3,593 crimes against property were acts of vandalism or destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics, 2006 [https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2006/index.html Hate Crime Statistics, 2006], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717214828/https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2006/index.html |date=July 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to the [[FBI]] Hate Crime Statistics for 2007, the number of hate crimes decreased to 7,624 incidents reported by participating law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics, 2007 [https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2007/table_02.htm Hate Crime Statistics, 2007], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709181446/https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2007/table_02.htm |date=July 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These incidents included 9 murders and 2 rapes(out of the almost 17,000 murders and 90,000 forcible rapes committed in the U.S. in 2007).&lt;ref&gt;Statistics, 2007 [https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2007/data/table_01.html FBI Crime in the United States 2007], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504123717/http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2007/data/table_01.html |date=May 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Attorney General]] Eric Holder said in June 2009 that recent killings show the need for a tougher U.S. hate crimes law to stop "violence masquerading as political activism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31392054/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/ |title=Attorney general urges new hate crimes law – Crime &amp; courts|publisher=MSNBC |date=2009-06-16 |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 hate crime statistics show 46.9% were motivated by race and 20.8% by sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lakeconews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=28459:fbi-releases-2011-hate-crime-statistics&amp;catid=1:latest&amp;Itemid=197 |title=FBI releases 2011 hate crime statistics |publisher=Lakeconews.com |date=2012-12-11 |accessdate=2013-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517030446/http://www.lakeconews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=28459%3Afbi-releases-2011-hate-crime-statistics&amp;catid=1%3Alatest&amp;Itemid=197 |archivedate=2013-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Hate Crimes Statistics report identified 5,818 single-bias incidents involving 6,837 offenses, 7,121 victims, and 5,475 known offenders&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015/topic-pages/incidentsandoffenses_final.pdf|title=Hate Crime Statistics, 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=ucr.fbi.gov|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutions of hate crimes have been difficult in the United States. Recently though, state governments have attempted to re-investigate and re-try past hate crimes. One prominent example is Mississippi's decision in 1990 to retry [[Byron De La Beckwith]] for the murder of [[Medgar Evers]], a prominent figure in the NAACP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Labuda|first=P.|title=Racial Reconciliation in Mississippi: An Evaluation of the Proposal to Establish a Mississippi Truth and Reconciliation Commission.|journal=Harvard Blackletter Law Journal|year=2011|volume=271|pages=1–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This would be the first time in U.S. history that an unresolved civil rights case would be re-opened. Byron De La Beckwith, a member of the Ku Klux Klan, was tried for the murder on two previous occasions and it resulted with a hung jury. However, he was finally sentenced to life in prison in 1994. Presented with testimony of two FBI informants who had infiltrated the KKK, the missing transcript from the first trial, the relocation of missing witnesses, numerous witness admissions of Beckwith bragging about his role in the murder and Beckwith's own racist writings, a mixed race jury found Beckwith guilty of murder. Even though De La Beckwith was 73 years of age when he was sentenced to life in prison, the 1994 conviction has been interpreted as a way for Mississippi to shed its racist past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alston, A.A. |author2=Dickerson, J.L.|title=Devil’s Sanctuary: An Eye-Witness History of Mississippi Hate Crimes|year=2009|publisher=Lawrence Hill Books|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Victims in the United States=====
One of the largest waves of hate crimes took place during the [[civil rights movement]]. During the 1950s and 1960s, both violence and threats of violence were common against African Americans, and hundreds of lives were lost due to such acts. Members of this [[social class]] faced violence from [[hate groups|groups]] such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] as well as violence from individuals who were committed to maintaining [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/hate-crimes-changed-history.html#|title=Hate Crimes that Changed History {{!}} Criminal Law|newspaper=CriminalDefenseLawyer.com|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, civil rights leaders such as [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and their supporters fought hard for the right of African Americans to vote as well as for equality in their everyday lives. African Americans have been the target of hate crimes since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]],&lt;ref name="americansperspective.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://americansperspective.com/10-of-the-worst-hate-crimes-and-violence-in-domestic-american-history/#|title=10 Of The Worst Hate Crimes and Violence in Domestic American History|date=2015-06-22|newspaper=americansperspective.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the humiliation of this [[social class]] was also desired by many Anti-black individuals. Other frequently reported bias motivations were bias against a religion, bias against a particular sexual orientation, and bias against a particular ethnicity/national origin.&lt;ref name="fbi 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2010/narratives/hate-crime-2010-victims |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]|title=Hate Crime Statistics, 2010|accessdate=March 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, these bias motivations overlapped, because violence can be both anti-gay and anti-black, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Doug|title=Evaluating the Severity of Hate-motivated Violence: Intersectional Differences among LGBT Hate Crime Victims|journal=Sociology|year=2010|volume=44|issue=5|pages=980–95|doi=10.1177/0038038510375737|url=http://soc.sagepub.com/content/44/5/980.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts have compared groups in terms of the per capita rate of hate crimes committed against them, to allow for differing populations.

Among the groups currently mentioned in the [[Hate Crime Statistics Act|Hate Crimes Statistics Act]], the largest number of hate crimes are committed against African Americans.&lt;ref name="Reports and Curricula"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.civilrights.org/publications/reports/cause_for_concern/p8.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/|title=Reports and Curricula|newspaper=The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Civil Rights Movement, some of the most notorious hate crimes included the 1968 [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]], the 1964 murders of Charles Moore and Henry Dee, the 1963 [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]], the 1955 murder of [[Emmett Till]],&lt;ref name="americansperspective.com"/&gt; as well as the burning of crosses, churches, Jewish synagogues and other places of worship of minority religions. Such acts began to take place more frequently after the [[racial integration]] of many schools and public facilities.&lt;ref name="Reports and Curricula"/&gt;

High-profile murders targeting victims based on their sexual orientation have prompted the passage of hate crimes legislation, notably the cases of [[Sean W. Kennedy]] and [[Matthew Shepard]]. Kennedy's murder was mentioned by Senator [[Gordon Smith (politician)|Gordon Smith]] in a speech on the floor of the US Senate while he advocated such legislation.  The [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]] was signed into law in 2009. It included sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, the disabled, and military personnel and their family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Matthew Shepard And James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act Of 2009 {{!}} CRT {{!}} Department of Justice|url=https://www.justice.gov/crt/matthew-shepard-and-james-byrd-jr-hate-crimes-prevention-act-2009-0|website=www.justice.gov|accessdate=29 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=military and families at least not obvious from linked article|date=June 2013}} This is the first all-inclusive bill ever passed in the United States, taking 45 years to complete.{{clarify|"all-inclusive" how/45 years how?|date=June 2013}}

Gender-based crimes may also be considered hate crimes. This view would designate [[rape]] and [[domestic violence]], as well as non-interpersonal violence against women such as the [[École Polytechnique massacre]] in [[Quebec]], as hate crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2YdCbgXjr-EC&amp;pg=PA405 |chapter=Hate Crime Statutes: A Promising Tool for Fighting Violence Against Women |first=Marguerite |last=Angelari |title=Pornography, Sex Work, and Hate Speech |editor=Karen J.

In May 2018, ''ProPublica'' reviewed police reports for 58 cases of purported anti-heterosexual hate crimes. ''ProPublica'' found that about half of the cases were anti-LGBT hate crimes that had been miscategorized, and that the rest were motivated by hate towards Jews, blacks or women or that there was no element of a hate crime at all. ''ProPublica'' found not a single case of a hate crime spurred by anti-heterosexual bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/police-are-mislabeling-crimes-as-anti-heterosexual-hate-crimes|title=Police Are Mislabeling Anti-LGBTQ and Other Crimes as Anti-Heterosexual — ProPublica|date=2018-05-15|website=ProPublica|language=en-us|others=Rachel Glickhouse, Rahima Nasa|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===

====Brazil====
In [[Brazil]], hate crime laws focus on [[racism]], racial [[injury]], and other special bias-motivated crimes such as, for example, murder by [[death squad]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L8072.htm|title=L8072|website=www.planalto.gov.br}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[genocide]] on the grounds of [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], race or religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L2889.htm|title=L2889|website=www.planalto.gov.br}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murder by death squads and genocide are legally classified as "hideous crimes" (''crimes hediondos'' in Portuguese).&lt;ref&gt;Law 8072/1990 (aforementioned link), Article 1st, I and single paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crimes of racism and racial injury, although similar, are enforced slightly differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boletimjuridico.com.br/doutrina/texto.asp?id=662 |title=Racismo ou injúria racial? - Boletim Jurídico |publisher=Boletimjuridico.com.br |date= |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 140, 3rd paragraph, of the [[Penal Code]] establishes a harsher penalty, from a minimum of 1 year to a maximum of 3 years, for injuries motivated by "elements referring to race, color, [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], origin, or the condition of being an aged or [[disability|disabled person]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Decreto-Lei/Del2848compilado.htm |title=DEL2848compilado |publisher=Planalto.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side, Law 7716/1989 covers "crimes resulting from [[discrimination]] or [[prejudice]] on the grounds of race, color, ethnicity, religion, or national origin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L7716.htm |title=L7716 |publisher=Planalto.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Brazilian Constitution defines as a "fundamental goal of the Republic" (Article 3rd, clause IV) "to promote the well-being of all, with no prejudice as to [[nationality|origin]], race, sex, color, age, and any other forms of discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao_Compilado.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chile====
In 2012, the Anti-discrimination law amended the Criminal Code adding a new aggravating circumstance of criminal responsibility, as follows: "Committing or participating in a crime motivated by ideology, political opinion, religion or beliefs of the victim; nation, race, ethnic or social group; sex, [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], age, affiliation, personal appearance or suffering from illness or disability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=1984|title=COD-PENAL 12-NOV-1874 MINISTERIO DE JUSTICIA - Ley Chile - Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional|website=www.leychile.cl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=1042092|title=LEY-20609 24-JUL-2012 MINISTERIO SECRETARÍA GENERAL DE GOBIERNO - Ley Chile - Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional|website=www.leychile.cl}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Middle East===

3.4.1. Israel
 
Israel is the only country in the middle east who has hate crime laws. Hate crime, as passed by the Isreli Knesset (Parliament), is defined as crime for reason of race, religion, gender and sexual orientation

==Support for and opposition to hate crime laws==

===Support===
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2015}}
Justifications for harsher punishments for hate crimes focus on the notion that hate crimes cause greater individual and societal harm.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} It is said&lt;ref&gt;Marian Duggan and Vicky Heap, ''Administrating Victimization: The Politics of AntiSocial Behaviour and Hate Crime Policy'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; that, when the core of a person's identity is attacked, the degradation and [[dehumanization]] is especially severe, and additional emotional and physiological problems are likely to result. Society then, in turn, can suffer from the [[empowerment|disempowerment]] of a group of people.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Furthermore, it is asserted that the chances for retaliatory crimes are greater when a hate crime has been committed. The [[1992 Los Angeles riots|riots]] in [[Los Angeles]], California that followed the beating of [[Rodney King]], a Black motorist, by a group of [[white people|White]] police officers are cited as support for this argument.&lt;ref name = "tvccce"/&gt; The beating of white truck driver [[Reginald Oliver Denny|Reginald Denny]] by black rioters during the same riot is also an example that supports this argument.

In ''[[Wisconsin v. Mitchell]]'', the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] unanimously found that ''penalty-enhancement'' hate crime statutes do not conflict with [[free speech]] rights, because they do not punish an individual for exercising [[freedom of expression]]; rather, they allow courts to consider [[motive (law)|motive]] when sentencing a criminal for conduct which is not protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/supreme-court-drama/wisconsin-v-mitchell|accessdate=2011-10-12|title=Wisconsin v. Mitchell|publisher=Enotes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst in the case of ''[[Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire]]'' the court defined "fighting words" as "those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Sumner | first = L.W. | author-link = L.

===Opposition===
The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously found the [[R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul|St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance]] amounted to viewpoint-based discrimination is in conflict with rights of free speech, because it selectively criminalized bias-motivated speech or symbolic speech for disfavored topics while permitting such speech for other topics.&lt;ref&gt;''[[R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul]]'', 505 U.S. 377 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics further assert that it conflicts with an even more fundamental right: free thought. The claim is that hate-crime legislation effectively makes certain ideas or beliefs, including religious ones, illegal, in other words, [[thought crime]]s.&lt;ref&gt;'''Sources''':

In their book ''Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity Politics'', [[James B. Jacobs]] and Kimberly Potter criticize hate crime legislation for exacerbating conflicts between groups.  They assert that by defining crimes as being committed by one group against another, rather than as being committed by individuals against their society, the labeling of crimes as "hate crimes" causes groups to feel persecuted by one another, and that this impression of persecution can incite a [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]] and thus lead to an actual increase in crime.&lt;ref name="Jacobs, James B. 1998"&gt;Jacobs, James B. &amp; Kimberly Potter. (1998). Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity Politics. New York: Oxford University Press,&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobs and Potter also argued that hate crime legislation can end up only covering the victimization of some groups rather than all, which is a form of discrimination itself and that attempts to remedy this by making all identifiable groups covered by hate crime protection thus make hate crimes co-terminus with generic criminal law. The authors also suggest that arguments which attempt to portray hate crimes as worse than normal crimes because they spread fear in a community are unsatisfactory, as normal criminal acts can also spread fear yet only hate crimes are singled out.&lt;ref name="Jacobs, James B. 1998"/&gt; Indeed it has been argued that victims have varied reactions to hate crimes, so it is no necessarily true that hate crimes are regarded as more harmful than other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Iganski, Paul, and Spiridoula Lagou. "Hate crimes hurt some more than others: Implications for the just sentencing of offenders." Journal of interpersonal violence 30.10 (2015): 1696-1718.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mellgren, C., Andersson, M., &amp; Ivert, A.-K. (2017). For Whom Does Hate Crime Hurt More? A Comparison of Consequences of Victimization Across Motives and Crime Types. Journal of Interpersonal Violence. https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260517746131&lt;/ref&gt; Heidi Hurd argues that hate crime represents an effort by the state to encourage a certain moral character in its citizen and thus represents the view that the instillation of virtue and the elimination of vice are legitimate state goals, which she argues is a contradiction of the principles of liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Hurd, Heidi. "Why Liberals Should Hate'Hate Crime Legislation'." (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some have argued hate crime laws bring the law into disrepute and further divide society, as groups apply to have their critics silenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Troy |first=Daniel E. |url=http://www.aei.org/speech/17122 |title=AEI – Short Publications |publisher=Aei.org |date=1999-08-04 |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610125417/http://www.aei.org/speech/17122 |archivedate=2011-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; American forensic psychologist [[Karen Franklin]] said that the term ''hate crime'' is somewhat misleading since it assumes there is a hateful motivation which is not present in many occasions;&lt;ref name=twsFrontline&gt;Frontline (PBS),[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/interviews/franklin.html Interviews], Accessed July 26, 2014, "...forensic psychologist, Karen Franklin's dual interests in psychology and the law brought her to question the roots of anti-gay hate crimes... badly needed empirical data on the nature and extent of negative reactions to gays..."&lt;/ref&gt; in her view, laws to punish people who commit hate crimes may not be the best remedy for preventing them because the threat of future punishment does not usually deter such criminal acts.&lt;ref name="twsAdvocate"&gt;{{cite web

'''The Hermit's Cave''', situated on Scenic Hill on the northeastern outskirts of [[Griffith, New South Wales]], [[Australia]], is in fact a complex of stone structures.

Misleadingly called 'The Hermit's Cave', the site in reality comprises a complex of shelters, terraced gardens, exotic plants, water-cisterns, dry-stone walling and linking bridges, stairways and paths that stretch intermittently across more than a kilometre of the escarpment. Made single-handedly  by  a reclusive Italian migrant, [[Valerio Ricetti]], these structures involved the moving of hundreds of tons of stone and earth, together with the ingenious incorporation of natural features in the landscape.

The site is recognised for being a rare example of an Australian hermit's domain. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 12 January 2007.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5056544|Hermit's Cave Complex|hr=01766|fn=H05/00285|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Over the period from around 1929 to 1952 the hermit [[Valerio Ricetti]] fashioned an outcrop of rock shelters and rock overhangs on a ridge top site outside Griffith into his living quarters. The historical archaeological complex includes rock shelters (some modified into cave-like enclosures), dry-stone walling, stone stairways and paths, terraced gardens, water cisterns, remnant plantings, inscriptions and rock murals. Over more than two decades Ricetti developed, utilised and occupied structures along the one kilometre long site where he lived in isolated seclusion from 1929 to 1941. He continued to work on the site until 1952 when he returned to Italy where he died in the same year.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

===Valerio Ricetti's history as told by others===

Valerio Ricetti was born in north [[Italy]] around 1897-98 in [[Sondalo]], a small town in a valley in the Italian [[Alps]], close to the border with [[Switzerland]]. In his home region he was apprenticed as a cement and stonemason and gained experience working on road and rail tunnel constructions. With the declining economic situation and impending war in Europe, his uncle encouraged him to migrate to Australia to seek better opportunities. Aged 16 or 17, Ricetti arrived at [[Port Pirie, South Australia|Port Pirie]],  [[South Australia]], in October 1914. He worked at Port Pirie for a few months before heading off to [[Broken Hill]] where he stayed at the Ceccato boarding house (signed-on as being 18 years old) and obtained work in the mines with Valentino Ceccato and Francesco Bicego. During his time at Broken Hill Ricetti learned to speak English which he spoke well although he retained an accent. Later, Ceccato and Bicego left Broken Hill and came to Griffith. Ricetti continued to work in the mines until 1918 when he left Broken Hill, heartbroken from being spurned by a barmaid he intended to marry. This love affair devastated him and scarred him for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3793&gt;P Ceccato 2001:15,43, pers.comm. 2004;  B Ceccato pers.comm. 2004; J Bicego pers. comm. 2004; J Bugno n.d: 1, cited in Caillard 2005: 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Ricetti travelled to South Australia where he worked at various jobs for several years. His life experiences fed his disillusionment with humanity.  With a year's timber-cutting wages in his pocket he departed for [[Adelaide]] where he visited a brothel. On leaving he found that he had left his wallet behind, but the bouncer would not allow him back in. He hurled a rock through a window, was chased and ended up in [[Adelaide Gaol]]. On release he left for [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].  In [[Melbourne]] he intended to pawn his one remaining possession, a coat, but a passer-by who offered to pawn it for him never returned. He moved on to [[Burrinjuck, New South Wales|Burrinjuck]], NSW, in 1928. In the decade since he left Broken Hill Ricetti had befriended many people but few of these friendships had lasted long. Leaving Burrinjuck, he set out on his own. For the next twelve months or so Ricetti followed the [[Murrumbidgee River]] downstream to the [[Lachlan River]] then upstream to [[Hillston, New South Wales|Hillston]], NSW.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Griffith's newspaper, "The Area News", reported in 1977 that "He finally found work on a riverboat of the period. He later explained that he had been a sailor on the Murray and that his "ship" had been the Mary Anne. The Mary Anne was one of the many boats that steamed the Murray, Murrumbidgee and Lachlan, and it would appear that Ricetti was to learn more about life during the period he spent on board her; perhaps something about love, unrequited. On the walls of his cave he etched a brief, pathetic epitaph to those days - two hearts and an anchor".&lt;ref&gt;(Fenwick 1977: 8 )&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Ricetti walked along the railway line to Griffith, with no idea of where he was heading. He was searching for a location where he could be on his own. That did not eventuate and he reached in Griffith in 1929.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Arriving on the outskirts of Griffith, a sudden rainstorm drove him to seek shelter on Scenic Hill. Next day he explored the area. About a quarter of the way down from the hilltop, he found a huge overhanging rock which was dry underneath. Close by he saw  two reservoirs full of water and fruit and vegetable farms at the foot of the hill. To the west was the town rubbish dump which teemed with rabbits.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Tired of travelling, and with no money left, he later recalled saying to himself "I have found the [[Garden of Eden]]". Ricetti decided to construct a private utopia, by making the cave his permanent home. He scavenged the rubbish dump where he found a half-worn out shovel, a pick head and an axe head. He felled tree branches to make handles for them. He believed himself to be the only Italian in the area and kept entirely to himself. In reality, his old compatriots Ceccato and Bicego from Broken Hill had settled nearby and increasing numbers of Italian migrants were settling the area.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Ricetti cleared and decorated the caves, creating massive stone galleries and pathways, cliff-side gardens and floral painted rock walls. He worked at night and early in the morning, to remain unseen, eventually moving hundreds of tonnes of rock. Digging under the huge rock, the earth that he threw out rolled down the steep hillside. So he set about building a stone retaining wall. As it was gradually back-filled, he increased the retaining wall height and length. Finally it reached 9 metres long and 2.4 metres high. This gave him a level surface of 2.7 to 3.7 metres outside the cave. Portions on either side of the rock were closed off with stones and clay mortar leaving an opening just  over 1 metre wide and 2 metres high to enter the cave.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Outside he planted flowers on both sides of a path that led to the top of the retaining wall. Turning right, he then followed along the top of the wall for about 6 metres where he had made a pathway a little over half a metre wide that led to and from the cave.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Under the lookout, some 36 metres to the right, is a formation of three high rocks in a half circle. The centre one is fashioned by nature as a dome. In front of these rocks he built a stone retaining wall about 1.5 metres high and 4.5 metres long. This he filled with earth to level it, and then he planted more flowers. He called it his "shrine".&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Further west he found an area that was partly surrounded by a sheer wall of rocks jutting out from the sloping hill. He made flower beds with pathways leading from one bed to another. On the sloping side he built small stone retaining walls. Near a corner of this complex were four large rocks, joined together front and back, with one either side forming a central open space about 3 metres in diameter. The top was open. On the garden side was a hole about a metre deep that he had to crawl through to get inside. Ricetti dug down in front of the hole to make it large enough to walk through, but just over half a metre down he found rock. At this level he dug inwards, carrying the soil up and forming more flowerbeds. At the centre of this "room" was a rock a little over half a metre high and too large to move. So with stone and clay mortar he shaped it into a table. At the entrance he made a stairway so he could walk down to the cave. For the top he laid thin poles across like a lattice, planting grapevines and wisteria to form a canopy.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Close to these gardens he had a couple of places to hide when people came. These places were not developed in any prominent way. But over the other side of the hill, some 180 metres from the main cave,  he built a stone walled circular cave amongst shrubs, around a large tree with a peephole which afforded him another place to hide when people appeared.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

In 1935 Ricetti fell off some rocks, breaking his leg and badly bruising his ribs. A passing swagman found him and notified an ambulance that took Ricetti to hospital where the Government Medical Officer, Dr E.W. Burrell, attended to him. He became a celebrity when the enormity of his work on Scenic Hill was discovered. During Ricetti's hospitalisation Wade Shire Council came to his assistance, resolving 'to attend to and maintain the gardens during the hermit's indisposition. Councillor Lenehan stated that the recluse, by vast labour, had added considerably to the interest of Griffith outlook and it was up to the Council to do something for him.'&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

After leaving hospital Ricetti returned to his reclusive existence. Anxious to pay Dr Burrell for his treatment, however, Ricetti slipped into town at night and worked in the doctor's garden. After a few visits the doctor caught him and explained to Ricetti that payment was made to him by the Government.  A friendship grew between the two, which Ricetti valued greatly. Dr Burrell would visit Ricetti regularly at the cave and leave boxes with useful items such as clothes and shoes.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

In 1937 a Mr Agostini wandered up the hill one night and came face to face with Ricetti. In conversation the names Ceccato and Bicego came up and Ricetti commented  that he had worked at Broken Hill with people of those names.  Agostini informed Ceccato of his contact with  Ricetti and the acquaintance between Ceccato, Bicego and Ricetti was renewed.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

On weekends they would pick up Ricetti, and take him to places where he met many people. They would try to coax him to come and live among them, but the hill remained his home. By now Ricetti had become more socialised and did not shy away from people.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

During World War II  Ricetti was interned as an enemy alien. He had allegedly lined one of his caves with newspapers that included reports of Hitler with the swastika prominently displayed (Fenwick 1977: 9 ). He was put to work building roads and instructed his captors on how to improve their road-building methods. After four months he was assessed, declared a deranged person and moved to a mental institution at [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]], NSW. Six months later he was released and sent back to Griffith where the police met him and told him to get a job, find accommodation and not go back to the hill. Asked if he could name someone he gave Valentino Ceccato's name, who agreed to take him in.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

From 1942 to 1952 Ricetti  worked and lived at the Ceccato's, first on Valentino Ceccato's farm until 1948 and then on the farm of Valentino'a son and daughter-in-law, Bruno and Nora Ceccato. From 1943-47 Ricetti worked in the orchards and vineyards alongside Valentino's son, Peter Ceccato, to whom he told stories of his life.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3794&gt;P. Ceccato 2001: 43, 45;  B &amp; N Ceccato pers. comm. 2004, cited in Caillard 2005: 29, 32-33&lt;/ref&gt; But Ricetti was always a loner, working away from others on the farm and sleeping in the pruning shed. He was troubled by visions and obsessed with his cave: "Disturbing him also was an illusion - a "man and woman in the sky". Very real to him, they towered above him, demanding that he do more and more work." By all accounts these visions stemmed from his disastrous love affair in Broken Hill.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3795&gt;Ceccato 2001: 37; pers. comm. B &amp; N Ceccato and P. Ceccato 2004, cited in Caillard 2005: 33&lt;/ref&gt; Ricetti spent as much time as possible at his cave where he stuffed his earnings from Ceccato into clefts in the rocks before Ceccato opened a bank account into which he paid Ricetti's wages direct (Fenwick 1977: 9 ).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

In May 1952 Ricetti  was in bad health and used the 1400 pounds he had amassed in wages to return to Italy and his brother, with whom he had lost contact.  He clearly intended to return as he bought a return ticket and left his savings in the bank.  But in November 1952 Bruno Ceccato received notice from the Municipality of Sondrio Vatellina that Ricetti had died&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3796&gt;B&amp;N; Ceccato pers. comm. 2004; P Ceccato 2001: 47, cited in Caillard 2005: 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Most information for this section is taken from: Peter Kabaila, "Griffith Heritage", 2005: 105-108. Also consulted:  W.H. Fenwick, "The Area News", 3 February 1977, 8-9; Bobby Caillard, "Recovering the Lost Landscape of Valeri Ricetti: the archaeology of an individual", BA (Hons) thesis, [[University of Sydney]], 2005: Vol 1, 28-34).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

===Valero Ricetti's history as documented===
There is very little documentation on Valerio Ricetti's life in Australia and it is almost exclusively confined to records of his internment, dated 1942-45, held by National Archives Australia. Much of the information contained in these records is in the form of Ricetti's answers to a Military Police Questionnaire prior to his internment in 1942. But very little of  this information provided by Ricetti can be substantiated by other documents.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Additionally, a photocopy of an employee record for [[BHP]] mines was obtained by both J Bicego and J Bugno.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Photocopies of most documents are reproduced in Bobby Caillard, "Recovering the Lost Landscape of Valeri Ricetti: the archaeology of an individual", BA (Hons) thesis, University of Sydney, 2005: Vol 2, 1-30.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Additional enquiries were undertaken by the Heritage Office with National Archives Australia (NAA);  State [[Record (magazine)|Record]] Offices in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales;  Glenside Campus (formerly Parkside Lunatic Asylum), Adelaide and Griffith Base Hospital, NSW.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

There is no record of Ricetti's date of birth. In 1942 it is recorded as 12 March 1897&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3797&gt;Caillard 2005: 7, 8, 11,12&lt;/ref&gt; and also as 12 March 1903.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3798&gt;http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The latter date is likely incorrect as Ricetti would have been only 11 or 12 years old on arrival in Australia.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Ricetti's arrival date and port of entry into Australia cannot be verified. In 1942 he reports that he arrived in 1914 at Adelaide, date and ship's name unknown, that he paid his own fare and that he had no family or friends in Australia on arrival.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3799&gt;Caillard 2005: 7, 8, 11, 12&lt;/ref&gt; But there is no record of his entry into a South Australian port as either a passenger, crew member or ship's deserter over a wide date range around 1914. Neither is he recorded as a passenger entering through a port in [[Western Australia]] or Victoria over an equally wide date range. Passenger shipping arrivals into [[Sydney]] for this period are not indexed, therefore were not searched (Heritage Office pers. comm. 2006: NAA Adelaide, [[Perth]], Melbourne; State Records SA, NSW; Public Record Office Victoria).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

On arrival in Australia, Ricetti claims to have spent "about one year in a mental hospital in South Australia, after which he went to Alice Springs and on to the [[Northern Territory]]".&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3800&gt;Caillard 2005: 8&lt;/ref&gt; One month later Ricetti claims that he worked in the Broken Hill mines from 1914–17 and on the railways at [[Grafton, New South Wales|Grafton]], NSW, from 1917-21 after which he came to Griffith where he was employed by various Italian farmers for a few days at a time. The records from 1942 also note Ricetti's two court appearances in the period before his arrival in Griffith:  at Adelaide on 7 October 1919 for a breach of the War Precautions Act (Aliens) (offence unspecified), fined five pounds or one month's hard labour and at [[Barham, New South Wales|Barham]], NSW, on 14 October 1927 for stealing, fined ten pounds or two months hard labour. The same records note that Ricetti claimed to have left his passport at the Adelaide Police Station but that enquiries failed to confirm this and that examination of his finger prints revealed that Ricetti was also known in Adelaide as Frank Pullen and Frank Muler.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3801&gt;Caillard 2005: 12, 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Of these claims, only Ricetti's employment at the Broken Hill mines in 1917, his 1927 fine for stealing and a possible gaol sentence in Adelaide in 1919 can be substantiated in the documentary record.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Records of the former Parkside Lunatic Asylum, Adelaide (the only such institution in South Australia at that time) for the period 1914-20 reveal no entries under various possible spellings of Valerio Ricetti or his two aliases.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3802&gt;Caillard 2005: 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Ricetti's employment at Broken Hill mines can be verified for only 9 days, 17 to 26 May 1917, after which date he left. The record shows that he resided at Eyre St, [[South Broken Hill, New South Wales|South Broken Hill]] which was the Ceccato boarding house at 305 Eyre Street. He is recorded as Vito Ricetti and his age given as 22 years (instead of 20 years), his age probably falsified to gain employment.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3803&gt;Caillard 2005: 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The Adelaide Register of Prisoners has no record for Valerio Ricetti but has two entries for Franz Recitti in 1919 and 1920. The related documents have not been sighted by the Heritage Office but these entries may tally with one of Ricetti's aliases and relate to either his 1919 breach of War Precautions or the Adelaide brothel offence related by Peter Ceccato&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3804&gt;Ceccato 2001: 17-23&lt;/ref&gt;(Heritage Office pers. comm. 2006: State Records SA).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

There is no record of Ricetti working on the railways at Grafton between 1917 and 1921 (Heritage Office pers. comm. 2006: NSW State Records).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The Police Charges and Summons Book, 1924-28 for Barham, NSW, (on the [[Murray River]]) records that Ricetti pleaded guilty on 14 October 1927 to stealing 40 dozen oranges for which he was fined 10 pounds in default of two months hard labour in [[Deniliquin]] Gaol ([[Charles Sturt University]], NSW, Regional Archives).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

During World War II, "enemy aliens" resident in Australia were required to register under National Security (Aliens Control) Regulations, to report to the police station each week and to carry an identify card at all time to avoid arrest ([[Dalton, New South Wales|Dalton]] &amp; Polkinghorne 1990: 845). Ricetti's internment record&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3798/&gt; and associated documents held by the NAA&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3805&gt;Caillard 2005: 16-25&lt;/ref&gt; confirm his internment as an enemy alien between May 1942 and December 1943. The documents also reveal the difference in assessment of Ricetti the individual by the local and state police services.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Ricetti was arrested by Griffith Police on 4 March 1942 for failing to register as an alien and to report to police .  Ricetti's statement that he was unaware of the requirement to register was accepted by the local police. He was charged with "being deemed insane and found wandering at large" but was discharged five days later following examination by Dr Burrell (who had attended him in Griffith Hospital in 1935) who pronounced him "completely harmless and therefor (sic) not a subject for medical attention in an institution".&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3800/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

In his reports to the Commissioner of Police, Sydney, the Officer-in-Charge of Griffith Police noted that Ricetti spoke German, French and Italian quite fluently. He commented on Ricetti's residence on Scenic Hill, his "considerable skill in stonework", and his work "to beautify the hill" which Ricetti had asserted to him to be "his mission in life" .  The officer noted that Ricetti had "long been regarded as an eccentric" and the "difficulty is experienced in getting anything like a coherent story from him" . He concluded that Ricetti was a "harmless mental deficient who lives the life of a hermit" and that it was not proposed to begin proceedings against him.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3806&gt;Caillard 2005: 8, 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Military Police [[Intelligence (newspaper)|Intelligence]], Sydney, however, thought otherwise. They required Ricetti's completion of a four page questionnaire and a search of his premises for "literature of subversive or disloyal nature" or "prohibited possessions". The search carried out on 10 April 1942 by Griffith Police found nothing.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3807&gt;Caillard 2005: 10, 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The questionnaire appears to have been completed in two stages with handwritten entries by Griffith Police and later, typed entries (that include Ricetti's court appearances) probably entered by Military Police Intelligence in Sydney. These typed entries give a more critical assessment of Ricetti. They comment that Ricetti resides "in the highest and most secluded locality in the District  ... about a mile from the various petrol depots, electricity substations and water channels in the Irrigation Area" and that he "is known to wander about at night". The entry continues that Ricetti "is regarded with a good deal of suspicion"—a statement that does not square with Griffith Police's assessment of Ricetti as "harmless" and "eccentric"—and concludes "We are of the opinion that this alien should be interned.".&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3808&gt;Caillard 2005: 8, 12-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Ricetti was arrested on 3 May 1942 on Scenic Hall and removed to the [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]] internment camp (south-west of Sydney) from where he was transferred to [[Cowra]] in July 1942. Records show he was released from Camp 12, Cowra on 16 December 1942  but also transferred from Cowra to [[Loveday, South Australia|Loveday]] internment camp, SA, on 21 April 1943.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3809&gt;Caillard 2005: 18, 23&lt;/ref&gt; One account suggests Ricetti was moved during his internment to a mental institution in Orange, NSW, for treatment.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3810&gt;Ceccato 2001: 35 &amp; 9&lt;/ref&gt; However there is no record for that period of Ricetti being admitted to [[Orange Health Service|Bloomfield Hospital]], Orange (at that time the only mental institution in Orange) .&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3811&gt;Caillard 2005: 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Ricetti was released from Loveday on 5 December 1943 and taken to Sydney where he gave his new place of abode as Farm 219 [[Yoogali]], Griffith (Valentino and Elizabeth Ceccato's farm). A year later (30 November 1944) Ricetti notified his change of abode from Farm 219 Yoogali to Scenic Hill, Griffith. This would indicate the earliest official acceptance of his occupation of this Crown Reserve as his place of abode, even though he is remembered as living on the Ceccato farm at that time.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Ricetti's departure from Sydney cannot be confirmed as NSW passenger shipping lists for 1952 are not indexed and therefore were not searched.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The absence of documentary verification for much of Ricetti's story can be at least partly explained by the loss or destruction of many records over time.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

===European traditions of hermitism and North Italian cultural influences===

Ricetti's experience aligns with European traditions of hermitism that are not essentially religious in origin whereby an individual makes a conscious (rather than an enforced) choice to remove himself or herself from society, often after a long period of solitary wandering (Ricetti trekked on foot for a decade from Adelaide through north Victoria and southern NSW to Griffith). Ricetti's choice of landscape conforms to many European hermit dwellings. Caves are frequently chosen, particularly those located on steep hillsides or in mountains. In this respect Ricetti would have drawn on his Italian upbringing  in a mountain valley of north Italy in making his choice of dwelling on the 200 metre high escarpment of the southern edge of the [[McPherson Range]]—a prominent ridge top location in the predominantly flat [[Riverina]] Plain. Spiritual iconography is common even among hermits living outside a recognised religious tradition.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

North Italian cultural influences can be seen in Ricetti's use of:
:(a) skilled stonemasonry with dry stone walling combined with backfilling  to create terraces for cultivation on steep and rocky slopes. The use of stone for farmhouses and the skill of dry stone (with no mortar) constructions are prominent in this region as is the use of terracing for cultivation.
:(b) planting of grape vines and fruit trees
:(c) the "Chapel"  with its painted Christian iconography.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Sources: http://www.hermitary.com; http://www.councilgrove.com/her_cave.htm; Bobby Caillard, "Recovering the Lost Landscape of Valeri Ricetti: the archaeology of an individual", BA (Hons) thesis, University of Sydney, 2005: Vol 1: 134)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

== Description ==
The Hermit's Cave Complex is a collection of rock shelters and rock [[Overhang (architecture)|overhangs]] (several of which have been modified by Ricetti to create cave-like enclosures) with elaborate stoneworks and earthworks created by Ricetti, all of which are located along a long, narrow ridge top site outside Griffith. Ricetti's work is over more than one kilometre along the south-eastern face of Scenic Hill which is a  200 metre high escarpment on the southern-most part of the McPherson Range. Scenic Hill is now adjacent to the western edge of  the Collina residential suburb. The southern and northern edges of the site are defined by  Ricetti's hide-outs constructed in rocky outcrops.  The western perimeter is currently defined by  the road reserve boundary of Scenic Drive although there are possibly remnants of other constructions west and north-west of this road.  The area of the nominated site comprises 16.16 ha with a length of 1150 m and varying widths of approximately 120 to 190m.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The archaeological remains of the site are located in discrete areas along the length of the site across a distance of  over one kilometre.  From south-east to north-west these remains are grouped as follows:&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

;1) Far South Rock Shelter  (possible main western hide-out)
* 40-step stone stair;
* hide-out with open rock shelter with three large stone blocks placed in a row;
* small, natural shelter with a narrow passage leading into a small chamber containing natural stone blocks that form a window opening.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

;2) South Rock Shelter (possible first dwelling)

Rock shelter containing:
* 18-step stone stair;
* dwelling with partly intact stone enclosure walls;
* remnant stonework (remains of the wall and another stone stair).
The small size of the shelter and absence of rock inscriptions and rock murals suggests this was a short-term dwelling used by Ricetti before he constructed and moved into the second, more substantial dwelling.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

;3) Southern Garden and Rock Shelter (possible second dwelling)
This dwelling is associated with two gardens, three cisterns, a rock shelter popularly known as "La Scala" (Opera House) and its inscriptions. It is recorded in historical photographs and is remembered to have been built and occupied before the third dwelling.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

''A) Rock Shelter containing:''
* east stone stair leading to the garden;
* bottom stone stair from the east, leading to a narrow passage between two boulders with a low wall into the dwelling;
* dwelling, being a rock shelter overhang that was walled off, containing a stonework window;
* top stone stair rising from the rock shelter overhang;
* west stone stair into a narrow passage between two boulders leading to a second, small chamber that contains a large flattish stone). This chamber is thought to have been a cistern.
* holes (chiselled out) that were used to support timber [[Trellis (architecture)|trellis]] structures.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

''B) Gardens''
The largest and most complex zone of the site being 60 metres long and 35 metres wide. Located along the base of a cliff face below the ridge top with a drop in level of 10 metres.
:i) Upper Garden. Designed as three terraces with cisterns, connecting [[stairs]], paths and a dwelling. Its remnant features are earthwork terraces with stone [[retaining wall]]s; metal materials (steel sheet, wire) for shoring terraces and construction; remnant fig plantings; remnant yucca plantings and yucca plantings that have invaded the surrounding area.
:ii) Lower Garden.  Contains the best -constructed and best-preserved example of Ricetti's stonework. It comprises an earth-filled stone retaining wall forming an elevated walkway.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

''C) Cisterns''
:i) Uppermost Cistern.  Situated in the top terrace and fed by moisture from the cliff face.
:ii) Second Cistern.  Situated outside the north-eastern retaining walls of the garden at the middle terrace level and fed by moisture from the cliff face and surface run-off.
:iii) Lower Cistern. Adjacent to and below the lower garden and fed by  surface run-off from the gardens and possibly the top cistern.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

''D) Natural Amphitheatre-Shaped Rock Shelter featuring:''
* stone retaining wall to form a bridge;
* stone staircase remnants;
* location of a bush timber ladder that was used to provide access to a rock shelf;
* rock inscriptions at the base of the cliff with a mixture of Christian and other motifs.
i) Rock shelter popularly known as 'La Scala' (or the 'Opera House')
* a place of suitable acoustics where Ricetti used to stand and call out. His voice could sometimes be heard as far away as the town
ii) Rock inscriptions at 'La Scala':

Rock inscriptions occur in three areas.

a) The lower rock gallery is at the base of the cliff and contains a mixture of Christian and other symbols:
* a court jester's face and hat, with three crucifixes representing the hill of Calvary;
* three fishes (an early Christian symbol) intertwined;
* apocalyptic message, incomplete, in back to front lettering in a combination of Latin and Italian: 'paratus nun qua no...'('be prepared').
b) Partly up the rock face, near the stone stair to the "La Scala" rock shelf, is the date 1918 and initials RV ( Valerio Ricetti's, back to front). This date predates Ricetti's known arrival in the area.

c) Inscription on a rock floor of later date is {{circa|1923}} (also predates Ricetti's arrival).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

''E) Two Stone Stairs''
*  upper stone stair built with low risers (possibly for carrying rocks from the quarry);
*  hidden stone stair, winding down through a passage between boulders.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

;4) Central 'Hide-Outs'
*  stone stair on contour forming part of the main track linking the gardens with the 'Main Cave';
*  natural chamber formed by two boulders with stone blocks at the entrance (the lower hide-out);
*  small natural rock shelter with no stonework (the upper hide-out).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

;5) Main Cave (possible third dwelling)
This dwelling is the best-known and best-maintained of Ricetti's works. It is associated with other structures that are popularly known as "Kitchen", "Gun Post", "Art Gallery", "Chapel", stone stair and "The Cliffs Cave" inscription.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

''A) Rock Shelter containing:''
* stone-walled sleeping chamber with doorway;
* painted rock murals featuring flower and ship's anchor motifs;
* second chamber with fireplace, known as the 'Kitchen';
* remnant fig planting;
* remnant oleander planting;
* back-filled retaining walls separating the dwelling from the "Gun Post".&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

''B) 'Gun Post'''

A stone earthwork resembling a small fortification. Historical photographs show a gang plank bridge connecting it to the third dwelling. No evidence of a real defensive purpose has been found, but it appears to have been used by Ricetti to monitor his surroundings.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

''C) 'Art Gallery'''

A separate chamber connected to the third dwelling. This was remembered to contain a cinema poster of King Kong.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

''D) 'Chapel'''

* natural rock amphitheatre with views to the east;
* earthwork terraces with stone retaining walls;
* various materials (steel, wire) still in place and visible, for shoring up and reinforcing the terraces;
* rock mural with cross and the initials VR to the left of the cross and RV to the right of it.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

''E) Stone Stair''

90-step remnant of stone stair constructed by Ricetti.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

''F) "The Cliffs Cave" Inscription''

A historic inscription (predating Ricetti's occupation) reads "H.M. Alf. Irv. Driver The Cliffs Born Nov. 21/-70". Alf Driver was the pioneer selector of the local property, The Cliffs. The inscription is chiselled in elegant, cursive script into the floor of the rock shelter which is located near a hazardous rock ledge that is reached by a narrow passage between two boulders. From the rock shelter there is a magnificent 180 degree view of the Riverina Plain and the slopes of the hill below. The site clearly has a larger and previous history of use by settlers and travellers and probably an even older Aboriginal association.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

;6) North Rock Shelter (1)
A narrow, rectangular shelter with two built walls, it is  well concealed at the foot of a sheer rock face. Located about 100 metres north-east of the third dwelling, it is connected by pathways to the third dwelling, ridge top and North Rock Shelter (2).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

;7) North Rock Shelter (2)
Defining the northern limits of the Hermit's Cave Complex, it is located about 100 metres north-east of North Rock Shelter (1):
*  enclosed rock shelter, well concealed and out of sight from both the ridge top and from below;
*  30-step stone stair connecting the shelter to the ridge top and the bottom of the hill. The top section (10 steps) is steep and narrow, descending between two rock faces.
*  faded white diagonal lines painted on one internal rock face.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

;8) Site of Western Shelter
This site is known through archival photographs and supported by oral history although no physical evidence of the structure has been found. Its stone structures were probably dismantled for use in gardens. Its location has been given as 'just to the west of the track [Scenic Drive] about 100-200 yards in on the flat, north-north-west of the cave's old entrance, north of the look-out'.

Archival photographs indicate a worked stone structure with large, smooth-finished rectangular blocks framing a wooden doorway with jambs and curved [[Lintel (architecture)|lintel]] of "wilga timber". The structure was a small room built around a hollow wilga tree at the base of which Ricetti had built a fireplace so that the tree could serve as a [[chimney]]. The door and a peephole allowed Ricetti to view the approaches from all sides.  Ricetti used the structure as both a kitchen and a hide-out but abandoned it because of visitors or vandals.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Sources: Peter Kabaila, 'Hermit's Cave, Conservation Management Strategy for Griffith City Council', 2006; Bobby Caillard, "Recovering the Lost Landscape of Valeri Ricetti: the archaeology of an individual", BA (Hons) thesis, University of Sydney, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

=== Condition ===

The gardens were reported to be in a fair condition as at 19 June 2006, although erosion of clay mortar supporting the stone masonry work on the retaining walls is a concern. Erosion is equally a concern on the retaining walls to the "Chapel". Graffiti is a concern, with graffiti damage to some of Ricetti's original rock art.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Some of the staircases are still in a pristine condition. Taking into account the nature of the rudimentary construction, the site is remarkably intact.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The site has considerable archaeological potential. There are possibly remnants of constructions to the west and north-west of Scenic Drive  (outside the nominated curtilage) but their locations are unknown.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The site retains most of its original design and material. Much of the original stonewalling is intact. It has suffered some damage due to graffiti, vandalism and erosion of original material.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

=== Modifications and dates ===
The landscape has been modified on several occasions between the 1970s and 1990s. The most prominent modifications ( by Council) are the Sir Dudley de Chair look-out area  above the "Chapel" and a steel hand-rail along the stairs from the lookout to the "Chapel" together with work undertaken by the Apex Club in the 1970s, being the construction of a 60-step stone stair  from the lookout to the "Chapel". Apex have also attempted to reconstruct part of the "Main Cave". Apex, however, used cement mortar, which deviated from Ricetti's utilisation of clay-mortar and dry-stone techniques.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==

The cultural landscape and historical archaeological complex known as the Hermit's Cave Complex has state significance as a rare example in New South Wales of a documented, extensive  and relatively intact complex of recluse dwellings that is an outstanding twentieth century archaeological site containing rare examples of rock art, historic graffiti, numerous stone structures, earthworks and remnant cultivation.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The Hermit's Cave Complex has multicultural heritage values that constitute material evidence of the response of one individual, the Italian migrant Valerio Ricetti, to the impact of migration in the period after World War 1. The site documents Ricetti's resourcefulness and skill and demonstrates a rare interpretation and integration of natural landscape and materials to create not just a shelter but, over time, an elaborate complex comprising hide-outs, a lookout and modified cave-like enclosures supplemented by retaining stone walls, linking bridges, stone stairways, paths and earthworks with terraced gardens, remnant plantings and water cisterns.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The Hermit's Cave Complex illustrates a European tradition of hermitism that is rarely found in New South Wales.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The Hermit's Cave Complex  has outstanding educational, interpretative and research potential as a resource for the study of historical archaeology and ethnic history.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Hermit's Cave Complex was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 12 January 2007 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''

The Hermit's Cave Complex has state significance for its capacity to demonstrate a historical pattern of migration experiences in material form. Ricetti's story of a  young, non English-speaking migrant with no family or friendship networks in Australia  is significant for the individuality of his response (in an Australian context) to the pressures and opportunities of migration.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Ricetti's retreat from human interraction  was marked initially by a decade of aimless solitary trekking around inland southern New South Wales and adjacent parts of Victoria and South Australia that ended with his decision to set down roots, build a retreat and live off the land in seclusion when he sighted the rocky ridge top of Scenic Hill on the outskirts of Griffith.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Over a 23-year period Ricetti did more than merely construct a habitable shelter on the ridge top. He invested a vast amount of time and physical labour in considerably modifying the landscape to suit his purposes and to create an aesthetically pleasing environment. He backfilled a total area of 505 square metres to create terraces for cultivation on the steep slopes of the escarpment. The soil in the cultivated areas has been identified as fine and pebble-free in an otherwise stony environment which indicates a sieving process (Ricetti could access and adapt materials located on the town dump nearby). The terraces were planted with a variety of edible and ornamental plants which demonstrates aesthetic as well as practical values. Ricetti collected, shifted, cut and placed thousands of cubic metres of stone to create the series of retaining walls around the ten identified terrraces and the extensive stairways that link the elements of the site.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The plantings have been identified as including grape vines, fig, olive and stone-fruit trees. These take several years to fruit which would indicate Ricetti viewed this cultivation as long term investment. Other plantings such as tomato, passion-fruit vines, sweet peas and lettuce would have required intensive care and nurturing in Griffith's semi-arid climate, evidenced by Ricetti's construction of water cisterns.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

This level of activity and attention demonstrates that Ricetti valued his dwelling with a high degree of both physical and emotional investment as a permanent home and a long-term project.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3812&gt;Caillard 2005: Vol 1: 139-141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Oral history indicates he was driven by "visions" to work on his project. Ricetti's response can perhaps be understood in the context of European traditions of hermitism, especially in the Alpine regions of northern Italy where his choice of landscape echoes that of many European hermit dwellings.  North Italian cultural influences can be seen in Ricetti's use of :
:(a) skilled stonemasonry with dry stone walling;
:(b) planting of grape vines and fruit trees; and
:(c) the chapel cave with its painted Christian iconography.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Ricetti's is an important story in the narratives of "difference" or  "the other", not only for his response to society but also for society's response to him. At the local level the community understands his "difference" and values his work on Scenic Hill: his hospitalisation engenders community support during his absence and, in World War II, the local police consider him no threat and his work to be valuable. At the impersonal level of state jurisdiction, however, his "difference" is viewed unfavourably. He is  demonised for his nationality and nonconformity and interned as an enemy alien, suspicions compounded by his 14 years of social alienation. These distinctions may reflect wider patterns in wartime internment processes.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''

The Hermit's Cave Complex is of local significance for its association with the extensively documented life of Valerio Ricetti, the subject of local folklore as the "hermit" of Scenic Hill.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''

The Hermit's Cave Complex is significant at state level  as an example of multicultural heritage and as an aesthetically distinctive cultural landscape. It demonstrates through its landmark qualities an individual's adaptation of  the landscape and natural materials to provide shelter, food and an aesthetically pleasing environment as a response to social dislocation and isolation.  As such it is in the tradition of European ascetic/hermit retreat dwellings created to provide for seclusion from society.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The landmark qualities of the Hermit's Cave Complex align with European traditions of hermitism that are not essentially religious in origin. Ricetti's choice of landscape conforms to many European hermit dwellings. Caves are frequently chosen, particularly those located on steep hillsides or on mountains. In this respect Ricetti would have drawn on his Italian upbringing  in a mountain valley of north Italy in making his choice of dwelling the 200 metre high escarpment of the southern edge of the McPherson Range—a prominent ridge top location in the predominantly flat Riverina Plain.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Spiritual iconography is common even among hermits living outside a recognised religious tradition. Ricetti's work reflects Italian hermit traditions of painting and inscribing important images and texts on cave walls.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

North Italian cultural influences can be seen in Ricetti's creative and technical achievements, specifically in his:
:(a) skilled stonemasonry with dry stone walling combined with backfilling  to create terraces for cultivation on steep and rocky slopes. The use of stone for farmhouse building and the skill of dry stone (with no mortar) constructions are prominent in this region and are reflected in the stonework of the Hermit's Cave Complex,  as is the use of terracing for cultivation.
:(b) planting of grape vines and fruit trees
:(c) decoration of the chapel cave with its painted Christian iconography.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The site is a popular place for meditative walks, in a setting reminiscent of ancient European archaeological monuments. The stonework and gardens recall  the stone structures and intensively modified rural landscapes of northern Italy.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

'''The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''

The Hermit's Cave Complex has social significance at the local level for the Griffith community,  and in particular the Italian community of Griffith and the surrounding [[Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area]], as an important element of local folklore.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

The Hermit's Cave Complex is of state significance as an outstanding example of a twentieth century historical archaeological site that is suitable for further research.
It has outstanding educational, interpretative and research potential as a resource for the study of historical archaeology, multicultural heritage and migration history:
* as an example of "ethnic nostalgia", reproducing aspects of structures and modified landscapes of rural  Italy in an alien setting (specifically the stonework and gardens)
* as a complex historical archaeological site
* as a migration story of an individual's response to the impact of settlement, internment and poverty.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

Outstanding level of rarity. The Hermit's Cave Complex has state significance as a rare, documented example of a known hermit dwelling and a document of recluse living, especially in terms of the extent and complex nature of the site.
Some of the known examples of hermit and/or cave dwellings evidence some construction techniques similar to Ricetti's, such as dry stone walling, some terracing and water provision. But these examples are either on a considerably smaller scale, are evidence of community activity or are constructions by squatters who were not hermits.
The known examples of cave dwellings appear to be linked to squatting, mainly in the 1930s depression. None of these examples show similar evidence of the extent and complexity of Ricetti's construction works at the Hermit's Cave Complex.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''

The Hermit's Cave Complex has state significance for being representative in its physical forms of some aspects of the small number of known examples of recluse living in New South Wales, most of which are in the Sydney region.
Enquiries have revealed a number of previously occupied caves in New South Wales that reflect either depression era occupation, squatting by individuals who are not necessarily hermits, or more elaborate constructions by communities of fringe dwellers.
Many cave shelters throughout the national parks that flank Sydney --- the Royal to the south, the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] to the west  and Kuring-gai Chase to the north --- were depression-era dwellings of the 1930s, such as the former fishermen's caves at Cape Solander ([[Botany Bay]]), the caves in the Domain in the city, and Poet's Cave in [[Lane Cove National Park]], Sydney, that was inhabited by a  hermit who was also believed to be responsible for a biblical inscription on a rock in the park.
In north-western New South Wales caves were occupied at Lightening Ridge and in the Warrumbungle Ranges, the latter reputedly used by cattle duffers (dates unknown).
Other "hermit-type" dwellings like the Crater Cove huts on [[Sydney Harbour]] and huts along the [[Hawkesbury River]] grew in popularity in the 1930s depression but originated earlier and continued their existence later as communities of fringe dwellers. The Crater Cove huts were first constructed by squatters during the 1920s in the [[Middle Harbour]] bushland and remained inhabited until 1988. They were built on the low cliffs and wide rock platforms facing the harbour with water tanks carved into the rock, stone built chimneys, paths and edging. A group of Hawkesbury River huts (with boat access only) were occupied by one family group and included wells, terracing of the ridges, gardens, extensive dry stone walling and linking pathways.
A large and impressive two-storey, Swiss chalet style dwelling was constructed by a squatter over a 40-year period from the 1920s at Hungry Beach in Kuring-gai Chase National Park. The building had 2 metre high circular stone walls, its own water supply, polished concrete floors and all fixed furniture (sofas, kitchen benches, cupbords, wardrobes etc)  was built of polished ferrocement. During World War II it was occupied by the United States military. The builder was not a hermit and he sourced (and paid for) building materials that he brought in by barge from Sydney. The building was reputedly demolished in 1969 while the occupant (then in his eighties) was hospitalised.
The Hermit's Cave Complex is representative of some of these construction techniques as a class or type of item and is the finest known example of its type.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

[[File:Números hiperreales.png|450px|thumb|Infinitesimals (ε) and infinites (ω) on the hyperreal number line (1/ε = ω/1)]]

The system of '''hyperreal numbers''' is a way of treating [[Infinity|infinite]] and [[infinitesimal]] quantities.  The hyperreals, or '''nonstandard reals''', *'''R''', are an [[Field extension|extension]] of the [[real number]]s '''R''' that contains numbers greater than anything of the form

:&lt;math&gt;1 + 1 + \cdots + 1 &lt;/math&gt; (for any finite number of terms).

Such numbers are infinite, and their [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]]s are [[infinitesimal]]s.  The term "hyper-real" was introduced by [[Edwin Hewitt]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt (1948), p.&amp;nbsp;74, as reported in Keisler (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

The hyperreal numbers satisfy the [[transfer principle]], a rigorous version of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz's]] heuristic [[Law of Continuity]].  The transfer principle states that true [[first-order logic|first order]] statements about '''R''' are also valid in *'''R'''. For example, the commutative law of addition, ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'', holds for the hyperreals just as it does for the reals; since '''R''' is a [[real closed field]], so is *'''R'''.  Since &lt;math&gt;\sin({\pi n})=0&lt;/math&gt; for all integers ''n'', one also has &lt;math&gt;\sin({\pi H})=0&lt;/math&gt; for all [[hyperinteger]]s ''H''.  The transfer principle for [[ultrapower]]s is a consequence of [[Łoś' theorem]] of 1955.

Concerns about the [[soundness]] of arguments involving infinitesimals date back to ancient Greek mathematics, with [[Archimedes]] replacing such proofs with ones using other techniques such as the [[method of exhaustion]].&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, [[Abraham Robinson]] proved that the hyperreals were logically consistent if and only if the reals were. This put to rest the fear that any proof involving infinitesimals might be unsound, provided that they were manipulated according to the logical rules that Robinson delineated.

The application of hyperreal numbers and in particular the transfer principle to problems of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] is called [[non-standard analysis]]. One immediate application is the definition of the basic concepts of analysis such as derivative and integral in a direct fashion, without passing via logical complications of multiple quantifiers.  Thus, the derivative of ''f(x)'' becomes &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = {\rm st}\left( \frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x} \right)&lt;/math&gt; for an infinitesimal &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;, where ''st(&amp;middot;)'' denotes the [[standard part function]], which "rounds off" each finite hyperreal to the nearest real.  Similarly, the integral is defined as the standard part of a suitable infinite sum.

==The transfer principle==
{{Main|Transfer principle}}
The idea of the hyperreal system is to extend the real numbers '''R''' to form a system *'''R''' that includes infinitesimal and infinite numbers, but without changing any of the elementary axioms of algebra. Any statement of the form "for any number x..." that is true for the reals is also true for the hyperreals. For example, the axiom that states "for any number ''x'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''" still applies. The same is true for [[quantification (logic)|quantification]] over several numbers, e.g., "for any numbers ''x'' and ''y'', ''xy''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''yx''." This ability to carry over statements from the reals to the hyperreals is called the [[transfer principle]]. However, statements of the form "for any ''set'' of numbers S ..." may not carry over. The only properties that differ between the reals and the hyperreals are those that rely on quantification over sets, or other higher-level structures such as functions and relations, which are typically constructed out of sets. Each real set, function, and relation has its natural hyperreal extension, satisfying the same first-order properties.  The kinds of logical sentences that obey this restriction on quantification are referred to as statements in [[first-order logic]].

The transfer principle, however, doesn't mean that '''R''' and *'''R''' have identical behavior. For instance, in *'''R''' there exists an element ''&amp;omega;'' such that

: &lt;math&gt; 1&lt;\omega, \quad 1+1&lt;\omega, \quad 1+1+1&lt;\omega, \quad 1+1+1+1&lt;\omega, \ldots. &lt;/math&gt;

but there is no such number in '''R'''. (In other words, *'''R''' is not [[Archimedean property|Archimedean]].) This is possible because the nonexistence of ''&amp;omega;'' cannot be expressed as a first order statement.

==Use in analysis==

===Calculus with algebraic functions===
Informal notations for non-real quantities have historically appeared in calculus in two contexts: as infinitesimals like ''dx'' and as the symbol ∞, used, for example, in limits of integration of [[improper integrals]].

As an example of the transfer principle, the statement that for any nonzero number ''x'', ''2x''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''x'', is true for the real numbers, and it is in the form required by the transfer principle, so it is also true for the hyperreal numbers. This shows that it is not possible to use a generic symbol such as ∞ for all the infinite quantities in the hyperreal system; infinite quantities differ in magnitude from other infinite quantities, and infinitesimals from other infinitesimals.

Similarly, the casual use of 1/0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∞ is invalid, since the transfer principle applies to the statement that division by zero is undefined. The rigorous counterpart of such a calculation would be that if ε is a non-zero infinitesimal, then 1/ε is infinite.

For any finite hyperreal number ''x'', its [[standard part]], st ''x'', is defined as the unique real number that differs from it only infinitesimally. The derivative of a function ''y''(''x'') is defined not as ''dy/dx'' but as the standard part of ''dy/dx''.

For example, to find the [[derivative]] ''f&amp;prime;''(''x'') of the [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, let ''dx'' be a non-zero infinitesimal. Then,

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=\operatorname{st}\left(\frac{f(x + dx) - f(x)}{dx}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\operatorname{st}\left(\frac{x^2 + 2x \cdot dx + (dx)^2 -x^2}{dx}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\operatorname{st}\left(\frac{2x \cdot dx +  (dx)^2}{dx}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\operatorname{st}\left(\frac{2x \cdot dx}{dx} + \frac{(dx)^2}{dx}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\operatorname{st}\left(2x + dx\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=2x&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The use of the standard part in the definition of the derivative is a rigorous alternative to the traditional practice of neglecting the square {{Citation needed|reason=if dx got to zero in limit then dx square go there too and doing this faster, this is rigorous|date=February 2018}} of an infinitesimal quantity. [[Dual number]]s are a number system based this idea. After the third line of the differentiation above, the typical method from Newton through the 19th century would have been simply to discard the ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; term. In the hyperreal system,
''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0, since ''dx'' is nonzero, and the transfer principle can be applied to the statement that the square of any nonzero number is nonzero. However, the quantity ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  is infinitesimally small compared to ''dx''; that is, the hyperreal system contains a hierarchy of infinitesimal quantities.

===Integration===
One way of defining a definite integral in the hyperreal system is as the standard part of an infinite sum on a hyperfinite lattice defined as ''a'',&amp;nbsp;''a&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;dx'',&amp;nbsp;''a&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2dx'', ... ''a&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ndx'', where ''dx'' is infinitesimal, n is an infinite [[hypernatural]], and the lower and upper bounds of integration are ''a'' and ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;''dx.''&lt;ref&gt;Keisler&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
The hyperreals *'''R''' form an [[ordered field]] containing the reals '''R''' as a subfield. Unlike the reals, the hyperreals do not form a standard [[metric space]], but by virtue of their order they carry an [[order topology]].

The use of the definite article ''the'' in the phrase ''the hyperreal numbers'' is somewhat misleading in that there is not a unique ordered field that is referred to in most treatments.
However, a 2003 paper by [[Vladimir Kanovei]] and [[Saharon Shelah]]&lt;ref name=kanovei2003&gt;{{Citation | last1=Kanovei|first1=Vladimir| last2=Shelah|first2=Saharon| title=A definable nonstandard model of the reals| url=http://shelah.logic.at/files/825.pdf| journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic|volume=69|year=2004| pages=159–164 | doi=10.2178/jsl/1080938834|arxiv=math/0311165}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that there is a definable, countably [[saturated model|saturated]] (meaning [[ω-saturated]], but not, of course, countable) [[elementary substructure|elementary extension]] of the reals, which therefore has a good claim to the title of ''the'' hyperreal numbers.  Furthermore, the field obtained by the ultrapower construction from the space of all real sequences, is unique up to isomorphism if one assumes the [[continuum hypothesis]].

The condition of being a hyperreal field is a stronger one than that of being a [[real closed field]] strictly containing '''R'''. It is also stronger than that of being a [[superreal field]] in the sense of Dales and [[W. Hugh Woodin|Woodin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Woodin | first1=W. H. | last2=Dales | first2=H. G. | title=Super-real fields: totally ordered fields with additional structure | publisher=Clarendon Press | location=Oxford | isbn=978-0-19-853991-9 | year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The hyperreals can be developed either axiomatically or by more constructively oriented methods. The essence of the axiomatic approach is to assert (1) the existence of at least one infinitesimal number, and (2) the validity of the transfer principle. In the following subsection we give a detailed outline of a more constructive approach. This method allows one to construct the hyperreals if given a set-theoretic object called an [[ultrafilter]], but the ultrafilter itself cannot be explicitly constructed.

===From Leibniz to Robinson===
When [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and (more explicitly) [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] introduced differentials, they used infinitesimals and these were still regarded as useful by later mathematicians such as [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] and [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]]. Nonetheless these concepts were from the beginning seen as suspect, notably by [[George Berkeley]].  Berkeley's criticism centered on a perceived shift in hypothesis in the definition of the derivative in terms of infinitesimals (or fluxions), where ''dx'' is assumed to be nonzero at the beginning of the calculation, and to vanish at its conclusion (see [[Ghosts of departed quantities]] for details).  When in the 1800s [[calculus]] was put on a firm footing through the development of the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]] by [[Bernard Bolzano|Bolzano]], Cauchy, [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]], and others, infinitesimals were largely abandoned, though research in [[non-Archimedean field]]s continued (Ehrlich 2006).

However, in the 1960s [[Abraham Robinson]] showed how infinitely large and infinitesimal numbers can be rigorously defined and used to develop the field of [[non-standard analysis]].&lt;ref name=robinson&gt;{{Citation | last1=Robinson | first1=Abraham | author1-link=Abraham Robinson | title=Non-standard analysis | publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] | isbn=978-0-691-04490-3 | year=1996}}. The classic introduction to nonstandard analysis.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson developed his theory [[Constructive_proof#Non-constructive_proofs|nonconstructively]], using [[model theory]]; however it is possible to proceed using only [[algebra]] and [[topology]], and proving the transfer principle as a consequence of the definitions. In other words hyperreal numbers ''per se'', aside from their use in nonstandard analysis, have no necessary relationship to model theory or first order logic, although they were discovered by the application of model theoretic techniques from logic.  Hyper-real fields were in fact originally introduced by Hewitt (1948) by purely algebraic techniques, using an ultrapower construction.

===The ultrapower construction===

We are going to construct a hyperreal field via [[sequence]]s of reals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Loeb | first1=Peter A. | title=Nonstandard analysis for the working mathematician | publisher=Kluwer Acad. Publ. | location=Dordrecht | series=Math. Appl. | year=2000 | volume=510 | chapter=An introduction to nonstandard analysis | pages=1–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact we can add and multiply sequences componentwise; for example:

:&lt;math&gt; (a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots) + (b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots) = (a_0 +b_0, a_1+b_1, a_2+b_2, \ldots) &lt;/math&gt;

and analogously for multiplication.
This turns the set of such sequences into a [[commutative ring]], which is in fact a real [[algebra over a field|algebra]] '''A'''. We have a natural embedding of '''R''' in '''A''' by identifying the real number ''r'' with the sequence (''r'', ''r'', ''r'', …) and this identification preserves the corresponding algebraic operations of the reals. The intuitive motivation is, for example, to represent an infinitesimal number using a sequence that approaches zero. The inverse of such a sequence would represent an infinite number. As we will see below, the difficulties arise because of the need to define rules for comparing such sequences in a manner that, although inevitably somewhat arbitrary, must be self-consistent and well defined. For example, we may have two sequences that differ in their first ''n'' members, but are equal after that; such sequences should clearly be considered as representing the same hyperreal number. Similarly, most sequences oscillate randomly forever, and we must find some way of taking such a sequence and interpreting it as, say, &lt;math&gt;7+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is a certain infinitesimal number.

Comparing sequences is thus a delicate matter. We could, for example, try to define a relation between sequences in a componentwise fashion:

:&lt;math&gt; (a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots) \leq (b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots) \iff  (a_0 \leq b_0) \wedge (a_1 \leq b_1) \wedge (a_2 \leq b_2) \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

but here we run into trouble, since some entries of the first sequence may be bigger than the corresponding entries of the second sequence, and some others may be smaller.   It follows that the relation defined in this way is only a [[partial order]].  To get around this, we have to specify which positions matter. Since there are infinitely many indices, we don't want finite sets of indices to matter. A consistent choice of index sets that matter is given by any free [[ultrafilter]] ''U'' on the [[natural number]]s; these can be characterized as ultrafilters that do not contain any finite sets. (The good news is that [[Zorn's lemma]] guarantees the existence of many such ''U''; the bad news is that they cannot be explicitly constructed.) We think of ''U'' as singling out those sets of indices that "matter": We write (''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...) ≤ (''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...) if and only if the set of natural numbers { ''n'' : ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; } is in ''U''.

This is a [[total preorder]] and it turns into a [[total order]] if we agree not to distinguish between two sequences ''a'' and ''b'' if ''a''≤''b'' and ''b''≤''a''. With this identification, the ordered field '''*R''' of hyperreals is constructed. From an algebraic point of view, ''U'' allows us to define a corresponding [[ideal (ring theory)|maximal ideal]] '''I''' in the commutative ring '''A''' (namely, the set of the sequences that vanish in some element of ''U''), and then to define '''*R''' as '''A'''/'''I'''; as the quotient of a commutative ring by a maximal ideal, '''*R''' is a field. This is also notated '''A'''/''U'', directly in terms of the free ultrafilter ''U''; the two are equivalent. The maximality of '''I''' follows from the possibility of, given a sequence ''a'', constructing a sequence ''b'' inverting the non-null elements of ''a'' and not altering its null entries. If the set on which ''a'' vanishes is not in ''U'', the product ''ab'' is identified with the number 1, and any ideal containing 1 must be ''A''. In the resulting field, these ''a'' and ''b'' are inverses.

The field '''A'''/''U'' is an [[ultraproduct|ultrapower]] of '''R'''.
Since this field contains '''R''' it has cardinality at least that of the continuum. Since '''A''' has cardinality

:&lt;math&gt;(2^{\aleph_0})^{\aleph_0} = 2^{\aleph_0^2} =2^{\aleph_0},&lt;/math&gt;

it is also no larger than &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;, and hence has the same cardinality as '''R'''.

One question we might ask is whether, if we had chosen a different free ultrafilter ''V'', the quotient field '''A'''/''U'' would be isomorphic as an ordered field to '''A'''/''V''. This question turns out to be equivalent to the [[continuum hypothesis]]; in [[ZFC]] with the continuum hypothesis we can prove this field is unique up to [[order isomorphism]], and in ZFC with the negation of continuum hypothesis we can prove that there are non-order-isomorphic pairs of fields that are both countably indexed ultrapowers of the reals.

For more information about this method of construction, see [[ultraproduct]].

===An intuitive approach to the ultrapower construction===

The following is an intuitive way of understanding the hyperreal numbers. The approach taken here is very close to the one in the book by Goldblatt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Goldblatt | first1=Robert | title=Lectures on the hyperreals: an introduction to nonstandard analysis | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | isbn=978-0-387-98464-3 | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recall that the sequences converging to zero are sometimes called infinitely small. These are almost the infinitesimals in a sense; the true infinitesimals include certain classes of sequences that contain a sequence converging to zero.

Let us see where these classes come from. Consider first the sequences of real numbers. They form a [[ring (abstract algebra)|ring]], that is, one can multiply, add and subtract them, but not always divide by a non-zero element. The real numbers are considered as the constant sequences, the sequence is zero if it is identically zero, that is,  ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for all ''n''.

In our ring of sequences one can get ''ab''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 with neither ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 nor ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. Thus, if for two sequences &lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; one has ''ab''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, at least one of them should be declared zero. Surprisingly enough, there is a consistent way to do it. As a result, the equivalence classes of sequences that differ by some sequence declared zero will form a field, which is called a hyperreal [[field (mathematics)|field]]. It will contain the infinitesimals in addition to the ordinary real numbers, as well as infinitely large numbers (the reciprocals of infinitesimals, including those represented by sequences diverging to infinity). Also every  hyperreal that is not infinitely large will be infinitely close to an ordinary real, in other words, it will be the sum of an ordinary real and an infinitesimal.

This construction is parallel to the construction of the reals from the rationals given by [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]]. He started with the ring of the [[Cauchy sequence]]s of rationals and declared all the sequences that converge to zero to be zero. The result is the reals. To continue the construction of hyperreals, let us consider the zero sets of our sequences, that is, the &lt;math&gt;z(a)=\{i: a_i=0\}&lt;/math&gt;, that is, &lt;math&gt;z(a)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of indexes &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;a_i=0&lt;/math&gt;. It is clear that if &lt;math&gt;ab=0&lt;/math&gt;, then the union of &lt;math&gt;z(a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z(b)&lt;/math&gt; is ''N'' (the set of all natural numbers), so:
#One of the sequences that vanish on two complementary sets should be declared zero
#If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is declared zero, &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; should be declared zero too, no matter what &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is.
#If both &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are declared zero, then &lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt; should also be declared zero.
Now the idea is to single out a bunch ''U'' of subsets ''X'' of ''N'' and to declare that  &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;z(a)&lt;/math&gt; belongs to ''U''.  From the above conditions one can see that:
#From two complementary sets one belongs to ''U''
#Any set having a subset that belongs to ''U'', also belongs to ''U''.
#An intersection of any two sets belonging to ''U'' belongs to ''U''.
#Finally, we do not want the empty set to belong to ''U'' because then everything would belong to ''U'', as every set has the empty set as a subset.

Any family of sets that satisfies (2–4) is called a [[filter (mathematics)|filter]] (an example: the complements to the finite sets, it is called the [[Fréchet filter]] and it is used in the usual limit theory). If (1) also holds, U is called an [[ultrafilter]] (because you can add no more sets to it without breaking it). The only explicitly known example of an ultrafilter is the family of sets containing a given element (in our case, say, the number 10). Such ultrafilters are called trivial, and if we use it in our construction, we come back to the ordinary real numbers. Any ultrafilter containing a finite set is trivial. It is known that any filter can be extended to an ultrafilter, but the proof uses the [[axiom of choice]]. The existence of a nontrivial ultrafilter (the [[ultrafilter lemma]]) can be added as an extra axiom, as it is weaker than the axiom of choice.

Now if we take a nontrivial ultrafilter (which is an extension of the Fréchet filter) and do our construction, we get the hyperreal numbers as a result.

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a real function of a real variable  &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; naturally extends to a hyperreal function of a hyperreal variable by composition:
:&lt;math&gt;f(\{x_n\})=\{f(x_n)\}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\{ \dots\}&lt;/math&gt; means "the equivalence class of the sequence &lt;math&gt;\dots&lt;/math&gt; relative to our ultrafilter", two sequences being in the same class if and only if the zero set of their difference belongs to our ultrafilter.

All the arithmetical expressions and formulas make sense for hyperreals and hold true if they are true for the ordinary reals. It turns out that any finite (that is, such that &lt;math&gt;|x| &lt; a&lt;/math&gt; for some ordinary real &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;) hyperreal &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; will be of the form &lt;math&gt;y+d&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is an ordinary (called standard) real and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is an infinitesimal. It can be proven by bisection method used in proving the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, the property (1) of ultrafilters turns out to be crucial.
Now one can see that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous means that &lt;math&gt;f(a)-f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is infinitely small whenever &lt;math&gt;x-a&lt;/math&gt;  is, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable means that
:&lt;math&gt;(f(x)-f(a))/(x-a)-f'(a)&lt;/math&gt;
is infinitely small whenever &lt;math&gt;x-a&lt;/math&gt; is. Remarkably, if one allows &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to be hyperreal, the derivative will be automatically continuous (because, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;  being differentiable at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;f'(x)-(f(x)-f(a))/(x-a)=f'(x)-(f(a)-f(x))/(a-x)&lt;/math&gt;
is infinitely small when &lt;math&gt;x-a&lt;/math&gt; is, therefore &lt;math&gt;f'(x)-f'(a)&lt;/math&gt; is also infinitely small when &lt;math&gt;x-a&lt;/math&gt; is).

==Properties of infinitesimal and infinite numbers==

The finite elements '''F''' of '''*R''' form a [[local ring]], and in fact a [[valuation ring]], with the unique maximal ideal '''S''' being the infinitesimals; the quotient '''F'''/'''S''' is isomorphic to the reals. Hence we have a [[ring homomorphism|homomorphic]] mapping, st(''x''), from '''F''' to '''R''' whose [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] consists of the infinitesimals and which sends every element ''x'' of '''F''' to a unique real number whose difference from x is in '''S'''; which is to say, is infinitesimal. Put another way, every ''finite'' nonstandard real number is "very close" to a unique real number, in the sense that if ''x'' is a finite nonstandard real, then there exists one and only one real number st(''x'') such that ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;st(''x'') is infinitesimal. This number st(''x'') is called the [[standard part function|standard part]] of ''x'', conceptually the same as ''x'' ''to the nearest real number''. This operation is an order-preserving homomorphism and hence is well-behaved both algebraically and order theoretically. It is order-preserving though not isotonic; i.e. &lt;math&gt; x \le y&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{st}(x) \le \operatorname{st}(y)&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y &lt;/math&gt; does not imply &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{st}(x) &lt; \operatorname{st}(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

* We have, if both ''x'' and ''y'' are finite,
::&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{st}(x + y) = \operatorname{st}(x) + \operatorname{st}(y)  &lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{st}(x y) = \operatorname{st}(x)  \operatorname{st}(y)  &lt;/math&gt;
*  If ''x'' is finite and not infinitesimal.
:: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{st}(1/x)  = 1 /  \operatorname{st}(x)  &lt;/math&gt;
* ''x'' is real if and only if
:: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{st}(x) = x &lt;/math&gt;
The map st is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] with respect to the order topology on the finite hyperreals; in fact it is [[locally constant function|locally constant]].

==Hyperreal fields==
Suppose ''X'' is a [[Tychonoff space]], also called a T&lt;sub&gt;3.5&lt;/sub&gt; space, and C(''X'') is the algebra of continuous real-valued functions on ''X''. Suppose M is a [[prime ideal|maximal ideal]] in C(''X''). Then the [[factor ring|factor algebra]] A = C(''X'')/M is a totally ordered field F containing the reals. If F strictly contains '''R''' then M is called a '''hyperreal ideal''' (terminology due to [[Edwin Hewitt|Hewitt]] (1948)) and F a '''hyperreal field'''. Note that no assumption is being made that the cardinality of F is greater than '''R'''; it can in fact have the same cardinality.

An important special case is where the topology on ''X'' is the [[Discrete space|discrete topology]]; in this case ''X'' can be identified with a [[cardinal number]] κ and C(''X'') with the real algebra &lt;math&gt;\Bbb{R}^\kappa&lt;/math&gt; of functions from κ to '''R'''. The hyperreal fields we obtain in this case are called [[ultraproduct|ultrapower]]s of '''R''' and are identical to the ultrapowers constructed via free [[ultrafilter]]s in model theory.

'''Intra-organismic perspective''' is a [[theory]] developed by [[John Bowlby|Bowlby]] that states [[infant]]s have an innate desire to develop attachments to other individuals. This desire is also thought to have been a result of [[natural selection]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6024">"'''Justice as Fairness: Political not Metaphysical'''" is an essay by [[John Rawls]], published in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls, "Justice as Fairness: Political not Metaphysical," ''Philosophy and Public Affairs'' 14 (Summer 1985): 223–51.&lt;/ref&gt; In it he describes his conception of [[justice]]. It comprises two main principles of [[liberty]] and [[:wikt:equality|equality]]; the second is subdivided into Fair Equality of Opportunity and the Difference Principle.

Rawls arranges the principles in 'lexical priority', prioritising in the order of the Liberty Principle, Fair Equality of Opportunity and the Difference Principle. This order determines the priorities of the principles if they conflict in practice. The principles are, however, intended as a single, comprehensive conception of justice—'Justice as Fairness'—and not to function individually. These principles are always applied so as to ensure that the "least advantaged" are benefitted and not hurt or forgotten.

Rawls presented the theory in the famous ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', subsequently revising it in ''[[Political Liberalism]]''.

==First principle: the liberty principle==
The first and most important principle states that every individual has an equal right to basic liberties, Rawls claiming "that certain rights and freedoms are more important or 'basic' than others".&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 2007:45&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Freeman argues, Rawls believes that "personal property" – personal belongings, a home – constitutes a basic liberty, but an absolute right to unlimited private property is not.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 2007:50&lt;/ref&gt; As basic liberties, these rights are inalienable: no government can amend, infringe or remove such rights from individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman 2007:51&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Mertens says Rawls contends that principles for a society are just when chosen by representative citizens placed within "fair" conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Follesdal|first1=ed. by Andreas|last2=Pogge|first2=Thomas|last3=Mertens|first3=Thomas|title=Real world justice : grounds, principles, human rights, and social institutions|date=2005|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9781402031410|page=86|url=http://thomaspogge.com/books/real-world-justice/|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', Rawls articulates the Liberty Principle as the most extensive basic liberty compatible with similar liberty for others; he later amended this in ''[[Political Liberalism]]'', stating instead that "each person has an equal claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic rights and liberties".&lt;ref&gt;Rawls 2005:5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second principle: the equality principle==
The Equality Principle is the component of Justice as Fairness establishing [[distributive justice]]. Rawls awards the Fair Equality of Opportunity Principle lexical priority over the Difference Principle: a society cannot arrange inequalities to maximize the share of the least advantaged whilst not allowing access to certain offices or positions.

===Fair equality of opportunity===
This principle maintains that "offices and positions"&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 2010:86&lt;/ref&gt; should be open to any individual, regardless of his or her social background, ethnicity or sex. It is stronger than 'Formal Equality of Opportunity' in that Rawls argues that an individual should not only have the ''right'' to opportunities, but should have an ''effective'' equal chance as another of similar natural ability.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, 2008: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/equal-opportunity/#2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difference principle===
The Difference Principle regulates inequalities: it only permits inequalities that work to the advantage of the worst-off. This is often misinterpreted as [[trickle-down economics]]; Rawls' argument is more accurately expressed as a system where wealth "diffuses up".&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 2010:291–92 &amp; 222–23&lt;/ref&gt; By guaranteeing the worst-off in society a fair deal, Rawls compensates for naturally occurring inequalities (talents that one is born with, such as a capacity for sport).

Rawls justifies the Difference Principle on the basis that, since Fair Equality of Opportunity has lexical priority, the Just choice from [[Pareto optimal]] scenarios which could occur would be that benefiting the worst-off rather than the best-off.

==Original position==
{{main|Original position}}
A key component of Rawls' argument is his claim that his Principles of Justice would be chosen by parties in the [[original position]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 2009: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/&lt;/ref&gt; This is a [[thought experiment]] in which the parties select principles that will determine the basic structure of the society they will live in. This choice is made from behind a [[veil of ignorance (philosophy)|veil of ignorance]], which would deprive participants of information about their particular characteristics: his or her ethnicity, social status, gender and, crucially,  their conception of The Good. This forces participants to select principles impartially and rationally.

{{redirect|Skullcup|other uses|Skull cup}}

A '''kapala''' ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] for "skull") or '''skullcup''' is a cup made from a human skull and used as a ritual implement (bowl) in both [[Hindu]] [[Tantra]] and [[Buddhist]] [[Tantra]] ([[Vajrayana]]). Especially in Tibet, they are often carved or elaborately mounted with precious metals and jewels. 

[[Image:Kapala skull cup.jpg|thumb|right|Tibetan carved kapala]]
{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
[[File:Kapala.JPG|thumbnail|Kapala]]

==Nomenclature, orthography and etymology==
'Kapala' ({{bo|t=ཀ་པ་ལ|w=kapala}}) is a [[loan word]] into Tibetan from Sanskrit ''kapāla'' ([[Devanagari]]: कपाल) referring to the skull or forehead, usually of a human. By association, it refers to the ritual skullcup fashioned out of a human cranium.

== Vajrayana deities ==
[[Image:Chakrasamvara Vajravarahi.jpg|thumb|right|The Buddhist Deities [[Chakrasamvara]] and [[Vajravarahi]], circa 15th century Painting Kapala is seen on one of the left hands]]
Many of the deities of [[Vajrayana]], including [[mahasiddha]]s, [[dakini]]s and [[dharmapala]]s, are depicted as carrying the kapala, usually in their left hand. Some deities such as the Hindu [[Chinnamasta]] and the related Buddhist [[Vajrayogini]] are depicted as drinking blood from the kapala.&lt;ref&gt;Benard, Elisabeth Anne (1994). ''Chinnamasta: The Aweful Buddhist and Hindu Tantric Goddess''. Delhi: Motilal Barnarsidass. {{ISBN|81-208-1065-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hindu deities ==
Hindu deities that may be depicted with the kapala include [[Durga]], [[Kālī]] and [[Shiva]], especially in his [[Bhairava]] form. Even [[Ganesha]], when adopted into Tibetan Buddhism as Maharakta [[Ganapati]], is shown with a kapala filled with blood. 

Some of the Hindu deities pictured thus are:

a) [[Kālī]], pictured in the most common four-armed iconographic image, shows each hand carrying variously a sword, a [[trishula]] (trident), a severed head, and a bowl or skullcup (kapala) catching the blood of the severed head.

b) The [[Chamunda]], a form of [[Durga]], seen in the [[Halebidu]] temple built by the [[Hoysala]], is described as wearing a garland of severed heads or skulls ([[Mundamala]]). She is described as having four, eight, ten, or twelve arms, holding a [[damaru]] (drum), trishula (trident), sword, a snake ([[nāga]]), skull-mace ([[khatvanga]]), thunderbolt ([[vajra]]), a severed head and panapatra (drinking vessel, wine cup) or skullcup (kapala), filled with blood.

==Uses==

[[File:Kapala Mala courtesy The WOVENSOULS collection.jpg|thumb|Kapala Mala, 19th century, Tibet, courtesy of the Wovensouls collection]]

In Tibetan monasteries a kapala is used symbolically to hold bread or dough cakes, [[torma]], and wine instead of blood and flesh as offerings to wrathful deities, such as the ferocious [[Dharmapāla]] ("defender of the faith"). The dough cakes are shaped to resemble human eyes, ears and tongues. The ''kapala'' is made in the form of a skull, specially collected and prepared. It is elaborately anointed and consecrated before use. The cup is also elaborately decorated and kept in a triangular pedestal. The heavily embossed cup is usually made of [[silver-gilt]] bronze with lid shaped like a skull and with a handle made in the form of a thunderbolt.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica''. [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9044643/kapala Kapala]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kapalas are used mainly for esoteric purposes such as rituals. Among the rituals using kapalas are higher tantric meditation to achieve a transcendental state of thought and mind within the shortest possible time; libation to gods and deities to win their favor; by Tibetan Lamas as an offering bowl on the altar, being filled with wine or blood as a gift to the Yidam Deity or all the Deities; and the [[Vajrayana]] empowerment ceremony.

== Charnel ground or sky burial ==
{{Main|Sky burial}}
The kapala is one of several charnel ground implements made from human bone found by tantrics at sky burial sites.
[[Image:Sky burial site, Yerpa Valley.JPG|thumb|left| Sky burial site in Yerpa valley in Tibet where kapalas are searched for by tantric practitioners]]

The charnel ground, an ancient Tibetan burial custom, is distinctly different from the customs of graveyards and cremation, but all three of them have been a part of the home ground of [[tantra|tantric]] practitioners’ such as the yogis and yoginis, Shaiva Kapalikas and Aghoris, shamans and sadhus. The charnel ground, often referred to as "sky burial" by Western sources, is an area demarcated specifically in Tibet, defined by the Tibetan word Jhator (literal meaning is ’giving alms to the birds’), a way of  exposing the corpse to nature, where human bodies are disposed as it were or in a chopped (chopped after the rituals) condition in the open ground as a ritual that has great religious meaning of the ascent of the mind to be reincarnated into another circle of life. Such a practice results in finding human bones, half or whole skeletons, more or less putrefying corpses and disattached limbs lying scattered around. Items made from human skulls or bones are found in the sky burial grounds by the [[Sadhus]] and Yogins of the tantric cult. The charnel grounds are also known by the epithets the "field of death" or the  "valley of corpses". In Tibet,  a class distinction in the burial practices is also noted. The dead High Lamas are buried in [[Stupa]]s or cremated but the dead commoners are disposed of in the Charnel ground or in a Sky burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yoniversum.nl/dakini/charnel_g.html|title=Charnel- and Cremation Grounds|first=Rufus C.|last=Camphausen|website=www.yoniversum.nl|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguides/tibet/sky-buria.htm|title=Sky Burial, Tibetan Religious Ritual, Funeral Party|website=www.travelchinaguide.com|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The products from the charnel ground are the charnel ground ornaments such as the i) Crown of five skulls, ii) Bone necklace, iii) Bone armlets, iv)  Bone bracelets, v) Bone skirt and vi) Bone anklets which decorate  many images of dakinis, yoginis, dharmapalas and a few other deities (as may be seen in some of the pictures and stone images depicted in the gallery here), and other products such as the Bone trumpet, the Skull cup and Skull drum used by the tantric practitioners. Kapala or the skull cup is thus a produce from the Charnel ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yoniversum.nl/dakini/charnel_o.html|title=Charnel Ground Ornaments and Implements|first=Rufus C.|last=Camphausen|website=www.yoniversum.nl|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laban movement analysis''' (LMA), sometimes '''Laban/Bartenieff movement analysis''', is a method and language for describing, visualizing, interpreting and documenting human movement. It is based on the original work of [[Rudolf Laban]], which was developed and extended by [[Lisa Ullmann]], [[Irmgard Bartenieff]], [[Warren Lamb]] and others. LMA draws from multiple fields including [[anatomy]], [[kinesiology]] and [[psychology]]. It is used by dancers, actors,&lt;ref&gt;Newlove, J. (1993) ''Laban for Actors and Dancers: Putting Laban's Movement Theory into Practice'', [[Nick Hern Books]], London. {{ISBN|978-1-85459-160-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; musicians and athletes; by health professionals such as physical and occupational therapists and psychotherapists;&lt;ref&gt;Bartenieff, Irmgard, and Dori Lewis. ''Body movement: Coping with the environment''. Psychology Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; and in anthropology, business consulting and leadership development.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Warren, and Turner, D. (1969). ''Management Behaviour''. New York: International Universities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Labanotation]] (or Kinetography Laban), a notation system for recording and analyzing movement, is used in LMA, but Labanotation is a separate system.

==Categories of movement==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2017}}
Laban movement analysis is generally divided into four categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.laban-eurolab.org/english/lbms/theory/|title=Theory|website=www.laban-eurolab.org|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Body ([[Bartenieff Fundamentals]], total-body connectivity)
* Effort (Energetic dynamics)
* Shape
* Space (Choreutics, [[space harmony]])

Other categories, that are occasionally mentioned in some literature, are relationship and phrasing. These are less well defined. Relationship is the interaction between people, body parts or a person and an object. Phrasing is defined as being the personal expression of a movement.

[[File:Laban Categories.svg|thumb|Example organisation of Laban movement analysis categories.]]

These categories are in turn occasionally divided into kinematic and non-kinematic categories to distinguish which categories relate to changes to body relations over time and space.&lt;ref&gt;Foroud, Afra, and Ian Q. Whishaw. "Changes in the kinematic structure and non-kinematic features of movements during skilled reaching after stroke: A laban movement analysis in two case studies." ''Journal of Neuroscience Methods'' 158, no. 1 (2006): 137-149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rett, Jörg, and Jorge Dias. "Human robot interaction based on bayesian analysis of human movements." In ''Portuguese Conference on Artificial Intelligence'', pp. 530-541. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laban Kinematics.svg|thumb|Organisation of Laban movement analysis categories into kinematic and non-kinematic groups.]]

===Body===

The body category describes structural and physical characteristics of the human body while moving. This category is responsible for describing which body parts are moving, which parts are connected, which parts are influenced by others, and general statements about body organization.

Several subcategories of body are:
* Initiation of movement starting from specific bodies;
* Connection of different bodies to each other;
* Sequencing of movement between parts of the body; and
* Patterns of body organization and connectivity, called "patterns of total body square connectivity", "developmental hyper movement patterns", or "neuromuscular shape-shifting patterns".

===Effort===
[[File:Laban-Effort-graph-labeled.jpg|right|thumb|Laban effort graph with effort elements labeled]]
'''Effort''', or what Laban sometimes described as dynamics, is a system for understanding the more subtle characteristics about movement with respect to inner intention. The difference between punching someone in anger and reaching for a glass is slight in terms of body organization – both rely on extension of the arm. The attention to the strength of the movement, the control of the movement and the timing of the movement are very different.

Effort has four subcategories (effort factors), each of which has two opposite polarities (Effort elements).&lt;ref&gt;Laban, Rudolf, and Lawrence, F. C. Effort. (1947). London: MacDonald and Evans.&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Effort Factor !! Effort element &lt;small&gt;(''Fighting'' polarity)&lt;/small&gt; !! Effort element &lt;small&gt;(''Indulging'' polarity)&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| Space ||     Direct || Indirect (flexible)
|-
| Weight ||    Strong ||      Light
|-
| Time ||  Sudden (quick) ||     Sustained
|-
| Flow ||      Bound ||      Free
|}

Laban named the combination of the first three categories (Space, Weight, and Time) the Effort Actions, or Action Drive. The eight combinations are descriptively named Float, Punch (Thrust), Glide, Slash, Dab, Wring, Flick, and Press. The Action Efforts have been used extensively in some acting schools, including ALRA, Manchester School of Theatre, LIPA and [[London College of Music]]  to train in the ability to change quickly between physical manifestations of emotion.

Flow, on the other hand, is responsible for the continuousness or ongoingness of motions. Without any Flow Effort, movement must be contained in a single initiation and action, which is why there are specific names for the Flow-less Action configurations of Effort. In general it is very difficult to remove Flow from much movement, and so a full analysis of Effort will typically need to go beyond the Effort Actions.

===Shape===
While the Body category primarily develops connections within the body and the body/space intent, the way the body changes shape during movement is further experienced and analyzed through the Shape category. It is important to remember that all categories are related, and Shape is often an integrating factor for combining the categories into meaningful movement.

There are several subcategories in Shape:
* "Shape Forms" describe static shapes that the body takes, such as Wall-like, Ball-like, and Pin-like.
* "Modes of Shape Change" describe the way the body is interacting with and the relationship the body has to the environment. There are three Modes of Shape Change:
** Shape Flow: Representing a relationship of the body to itself. Essentially a stream of consciousness expressed through movement, this could be amoebic movement or could be mundane habitual actions, like shrugging, shivering, rubbing an injured shoulder, etc. 
** Directional: Representing a relationship where the body is directed toward some part of the environment. It is divided further into Spoke-like (punching, pointing, etc.) and Arc-like (swinging a tennis racket, painting a fence)
** Carving: Representing a relationship where the body is actively and three dimensionally interacting with the volume of the environment. Examples include kneading bread dough, wringing out a towel, avoiding laser-beams or miming the shape of an imaginary object. In some cases, and historically, this is referred to as Shaping, though many practitioners feel that all three Modes of Shape Change are "shaping" in some way, and that the term is thus ambiguous and overloaded.
* "Shape Qualities" describe the way the body is changing (in an active way) toward some point in space. In the simplest form, this describes whether the body is currently Opening (growing larger with more extension) or Closing (growing smaller with more flexion). There are more specific terms – Rising, Sinking, Spreading, Enclosing, Advancing, and Retreating, which refer to specific dimensions of spatial orientations.
* "Shape Flow Support" describes the way the torso (primarily) can change in shape to support movements in the rest of the body. It is often referred to as something which is present or absent, though there are more refined descriptors.

===Space===
{{Main|Space Harmony}}
One of Laban's primary contributions to Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) are his theories of Space. This category involves motion in connection with the environment, and with spatial patterns, pathways, and lines of spatial tension. Laban described a complex system of geometry based on crystalline forms, [[Platonic solids]], and the structure of the human body. He felt that there were ways of organizing and moving in space that were specifically harmonious, in the same sense as music can be harmonious. Some combinations and organizations were more theoretically and aesthetically pleasing. As with music, [[Space Harmony]] sometimes takes the form of set 'scales' of movement within geometric forms. These scales can be practiced in order to refine the range of movement and reveal individual movement preferences. The abstract and theoretical depth of this part of the system is often considered to be much greater than the rest of the system. In practical terms, there is much of the Space category that does not specifically contribute to the ideas of Space Harmony.

This category also describes and notates choices which refer specifically to space, paying attention to:
* Kinesphere: the area that the body is moving within and how the mover is paying attention to it.
* Spatial Intention: the directions or points in space that the mover is identifying or using.
* Geometrical observations of where the movement is being done, in terms of emphasis of directions, places in space, planar movement, etc.

The Space category is currently under continuing development, more so since exploration of non-Euclidean geometry and physics has evolved.

==Use in human–computer interaction==
LMA is used in Human-Computer Interaction as a means of extracting useful features from a human's movement to be understood by a computer,&lt;ref&gt;Roudposhti, Kamrad Khoshhal, Luís Santos, Hadi Aliakbarpour, and Jorge Dias. "Parameterizing interpersonal behaviour with laban movement analysis—a bayesian approach." In ''Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), 2012 IEEE Computer Society Conference on'', pp. 7-13. IEEE, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as generating realistic movement animation for virtual agents &lt;ref&gt;Chi, Diane, Monica Costa, Liwei Zhao, and Norman Badler. "The EMOTE model for effort and shape." In ''Proceedings of the 27th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques'', pp. 173-182. ACM Press/Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and robots.&lt;ref&gt;Nakata, Toru, Tomomasa Sato, Taketoshi Mori, and Hiroshi Mizoguchi. "Expression of emotion and intention by robot body movement." In ''Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Autonomous Systems''. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal Study==

Laban movement analysis practitioners and educators who studied at [[Laban/Bartenieff Institute of Movement Studies (LIMS)|LIMS]], an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Dance (NASD), are known as "Certified Movement Analysts" (CMAs).

Laban/Bartenieff and Somatic Studies International™ ([https://labaninternational.org/ LSSI]), is an approved training program of ISMETA, and offers Movement Analysis and Somatic Practice training, which qualifies “Certified Movement Analysts &amp; Somatic Practitioners” (CMA-SPs).

Other courses offer LMA studies, including Integrated Movement Studies, which qualifies "Certified Laban/Bartenieff Movement Analysts" (CLMAs).

The '''Lambda 10 Project''' is a national [[wikt:clearing house|clearinghouse]] of information pertaining to [[LGBT]] issues in [[United States|American]] [[fraternities and sororities]]. The [[organization]] works to heighten the visibility of [[Coming out|out]] members (chiefly [[university]] [[student]]s), and offers educational resources related to [[sexual orientation]] and the fraternity/sorority experience.&lt;ref name="glbtq"&gt;{{Cite web | last =Kaczorowski | first =Craig | title =Fraternities and Sororities | work =glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture | publisher =glbtq, Inc. | date =2004-02-12| url =http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/fraternities,2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lambda 10 Project was founded in the autumn of 1995 at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana]]; it is currently [[Headquarters|headquartered]] in the University's Office of Student Ethics and Anti-harassment Programs.

Among the organization's offerings are an index of [[lecture]]rs available for events; lists of [[Internet forum|forum]]s concerning LGBT "[[Fraternities and sororities|Greek life]]"; and a repository of [[magazine]] articles, [[website]]s, and pertinent [[news]] stories. Working with the renowned LGBT [[publisher]] [[Alyson Publications]], '''Lambda 10''' also compiled and released three [[Anthology|anthologies]] of [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] and [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] students' Greek experiences: ''Out on Fraternity Row: Personal Accounts of Being Gay in a College Fraternity'' (1998), ''Secret Sisters: Stories of Being Lesbian and Bisexual in a College Sorority'' (2001) and ''Brotherhood: Gay Life in College Fraternities'' (2005).&lt;ref name="Lambda 10"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lambda10.org|work=Lambda 10 Project |publisher=Campus Pride, Inc.|accessdate=2009-12-03 |title=National Clearinghouse for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Fraternity &amp; Sorority Issues}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lambda 10 Project is an educational initiative of [[Campus Pride]], an [[United States|American]] national [[nonprofit]] [[501(c)(3)#501.28c.29.283.29|501(c)(3)]] organization which serves [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]] and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) and [[straight ally|ally]] [[student]] leaders and/or [[student society|campus organization]].  It is an associate member of the [[Association of Fraternity Advisors]] and serves as a resource for the leaders of numerous national and international fraternities and sororities.

The Project created an educational resource titled Out on Fraternity Row: Personal Accounts of Being Gay in a College Fraternity released by Alyson Publications, Inc in 1998, Secret Sisters: Stories of Being Lesbian &amp; Bisexual in a College Sorority released by Alyson Publications, Inc. in 2001 and recently Brotherhood: Gay Life in College Fraternities released by Alyson Publications, Inc. in October 2005.

Ethical limitarianism is an [[ethical theory]] relating to priorities of intervention where need or risk might be evident.  As the [[principle]] of [[distributive justice]] advanced by [[Ingrid Robeyns]], limitarianism states that it is morally impermissible to be (excessively) [[Wealth|rich]] (i.e. have more economic resources than a certain level).

==Types of ethical limitarianism==

'''Ethical limitarianism'''

Ethical limitarianism is an [[ethical theory]] which (1) tries to be a partial [[Explanation|account]] of [[distributive justice]], (2) which belongs within the realms of politics rather than morality, (3) which is conceived and developed at the level of non-ideal theory, (4) which relies on an instrumental justification.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/36357522/Assessing_Non-intrinsic_Limitarianism Volacu, A., Dumitru, A., Assessing Non-intrinsic Limitarianism]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is related to [[effective altruism]].

'''Democratic Limitarianism'''

Democratic Limitarianism is a [[political theory]] that [[governments]] have priority duties to 
their citizenry to protect from risk and to ensure independence from fear, and thereby it urges that government prioritize protecting its citizens against fear of death or injury from: 
* Domestic threats
* Foreign threats
* Social insecurity
* Environmental hazard
A political movement advocates this [[prioritarianism|prioritization]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://thelimitarian.wordpress.com/democratic-limitarianism-what-and-why/ Democratic Limitarianism: What and Why.  The Limitarian, Citizen 2.0 website, accessed 1/2/2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethical limitarianism of [[Ingrid Robeyns]] would contrast with this view of democratic limitarianism.

==Earlier uses of term limitarianism==
Ethical limitarianism is not to be confused with [[Christian theology|Christian theological]] limitarianism, which teaches that [[History of the Calvinist–Arminian debate|Christ's atonement]] applies only to [[the elect]] (as [[Calvinism]]), and not to all humanity (as [[Christian universalism]] taught), or of [[limited atonement]] and [[irresistible grace]] as [[St. Augustine]] had taught.

'''Love and hate''' as co-existing forces have been thoroughly explored within the literature of [[psychoanalysis]],&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (1974) p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; building on awareness of their co-existence in Western culture reaching back to the “odi et amo” of [[Catullus]],&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Fowler, ''A Dictionary of Modern English Usage'' (1991) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Plato]]'s ''Symposium''.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 119n&lt;/ref&gt;

==Love and hate in Freud’s work==
[[Ambivalence]] was the term borrowed by [[Sigmund Freud]] to indicate the simultaneous presence of [[love]] and [[hate]] towards the same object.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) P. 118-9&lt;/ref&gt; While the roots of ambivalence can be traced back to breast-feeding in the [[oral stage]], it was re-inforced during toilet-training as well.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (1974) p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Freudian followers such as [[Karl Abraham]] and [[Erik H. Erikson]] distinguished between an early sub-stage with no ambivalence at all towards the mother’s breast, and a later oral-sadistic sub-phase where the biting activity emerges and the phenomenon of ambivalence appears for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Erikson, ''Childhood and Society'' (1973) p. 66-74&lt;/ref&gt; The child is interested in both libidinal and aggressive gratifications, and the mother’s breast is at the same time loved and hated.

While during the [[pre-oedipal]] stages ambivalent feelings are expressed in a dyadic relationship between the mother and the child, during the [[oedipal conflict]] ambivalence is experienced for the first time within a triangular context which involves the child, the mother and the father. In this stage, both the boy and the girl develop negative feelings of jealousy, hostility and rivalry toward the parent of the same sex, but with different mechanisms for the two sexes.  The boy’s attachment to his mother becomes stronger, and he starts developing negative feelings of rivalry and hostility toward the father. The boy wishes to destroy the father so that he can become his mother’s unique love object. On the other hand, the girl starts a love relationship with her father. The mother is seen by the girl as a competitor for the father’s love and so the girl starts feeling hostility and jealousy towards her. The negative feelings which arise in this phase coexist with love and affection toward the parent of the same sex and result in an ambivalence which is expressed in feelings, behavior and fantasies.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 60-3&lt;/ref&gt; The negative feelings are a source of [[anxiety]] for the child who is afraid that the parent of the same sex would take revenge on him/her. In order to lessen the anxiety, the child activates the [[defense mechanism]] of [[identification (psychology)|identification]], and identifies with the parent of the same sex. This process leads to the formation of the Super-Ego.

According to Freud, ambivalence is the precondition for melancholia, together with loss of a loved object, oral regression and discharge of the aggression toward the self. In this condition, the ambivalently loved object is introjected, and the libido is withdrawn into the self in order to establish identification with the loved object.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; The object loss then turns into an ego loss and the conflict between the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|Ego]] and the Super-Ego becomes manifested. The same ambivalence occurs in the obsessional neurosis, but there it remains related to the outside object.

==In the work of Melanie Klein==

The [[object relations theory]] of [[Melanie Klein]] pivoted around the importance of love and hate, concern for and destruction of others, from infancy onwards.&lt;ref&gt;P. Marcus/A. Rosenberg, ''Psychoanalytic Versions of the Human Condition'' (1998) p. 118-120&lt;/ref&gt; Klein stressed the importance of inborn [[aggression]] as a reflection of the [[death drive]] and talked about the battle of love and hatred throughout the life span. As life begins, the first object for the infant to relate with the external world is the mother. It is there that both good and bad aspects of the self are split and projected as love and hatred to the mother and the others around her later on: as analyst, she would find herself split similarly into a “nice” and a “bad” Mrs Klein.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Segal, ''Melanie Klein'' (2001) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Paranoid-schizoid and depressive positions|paranoid-schizoid position]], the infant sees objects around it either as good or bad, according to his/her experiences with them. They are felt to be loving and good when the infant’s wishes are gratified and happy feelings prevail. On the other hand, objects are seen as bad when the infant’s wishes are not met adequately and frustration prevails. In the child’s world there is not yet a distinction between fantasy and reality; loving and hating experiences towards the good and bad objects are believed to have an actual impact on the surrounding objects. Therefore, the infant must keep these loving and hating emotions as distinct as possible, because of the [[paranoid anxiety]] that the destructive force of the bad object will destroy the loving object from which the infant gains refuge against the bad objects. The mother must be either good or bad and the feeling experienced is either love or hate.

However, later in development, these emotions start to get integrated, in a natural process. As the infant’s potential to tolerate ambivalent feelings with the [[Paranoid-schizoid and depressive positions|depressive position]], the infant starts forming a perception of the objects around it as both good and bad, thus tolerating the coexistence of these two opposite feelings for the same object where experience had previously been either idealised or dismissed as bad, the good object can be accepted as frustrating without losing its acceptable status.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Segal, ''Introduction to the World of Melanie Klein'' (1964) p. 106-7&lt;/ref&gt; When this takes place, the previous paranoid anxiety (that the bad object will destroy everything) transforms into a [[depressive anxiety]]; this is the intense fear that the child’s own destructiveness (hate) will damage the beloved others. Subsequently, for the coexistence of love and hate to be attainable, the child must believe in her ability to contain hate, without letting it destroy the loving objects. He/she must believe in the prevalence of the loving feelings over his/her aggressiveness. Since this ambivalent state is hard to preserve, under difficult circumstances it is lost, and the person returns to the previous manner keeping love and hate distinct for a period of time until he/she is able to regain the capacity for ambivalence.

==In the work of Ian Suttie==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}

[[Ian Dishart Suttie]] (1898-1935) wrote the book ''[[The Origins of Love and Hate]]'', which was first published in 1935, a few days after his death. He was born in Glasgow and was the third of four children. His father was a general practitioner, and Ian Suttie and both of his brothers and his sister became doctors as well. He qualified from Glasgow University in 1914. After a year he went into psychiatry.

Although his work has been out of print in England for some years, it is still relevant today.{{dubious|date=May 2013}} It has been often cited and makes a contribution towards understanding the more difficult aspects of family relationships and friendships.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} He can be seen as one of the first significant [[Object relations theory|object relations theorists]] and his ideas anticipated the concepts put forward by modern self psychologists.

Although Ian Suttie was working within the tradition set by Freud, there were a lot of concepts of Freud’s theory he disagreed with. First of all, Suttie saw sociability, the craving for companionship, the need to love and be loved, to exchange and to participate, to be as primary as sexuality itself. And in contrast with Freud he didn’t see sociability and love simply as a derivative from sexuality. Secondly, Ian Suttie explained anxiety and neurotic maladjustment, as a reaction on the failure of finding a response for this sociability; when primary social love and tenderness fails to find the response it seeks, the arisen frustration will produce a kind of [[separation anxiety]]. This view is more clearly illustrated by a piece of writing of Suttie himself: ‘Instead of an armament of instincts, latent or otherwise, the child is born with a simple attachment-to-mother who is the sole source of food and protection… the need for a mother is primarily presented to the child mind as a need for company and as a discomfort in isolation’.

Ian [[Suttie]] saw the infant as striving from the first to relate to his mother, and future mental health would depend on the success or failure of this first relationship ([[object relations]]). Another advocate of the object relations paradigm is [[Melanie Klein]]. Object relations was in contrast with Freud’s [[psychoanalysis]]. The advocates of this object relations paradigm all, in exception of Melanie Klein, held the opinion that most differences in individual development that are of importance for mental health could be traced to differences in the way children were treated by their parents or to the loss or separation of parent-figures. In the explanation of the love and hate relationship by Ian Suttie, the focus, not surprisingly, lies in relations and the social environment. According to Suttie, Freud saw love and hate as two distinct instincts. Hate had to be overcome with love, and because both terms are seen as two different instincts, this means [[psychological repression|repression]]. In Suttie’s view however, this is incompatible with the other Freudian view that life is a struggle to attain peace by the release of the impulse. These inconsistencies would be caused by leaving out the social situations and motives. Suttie saw hate as the frustration aspect of love. “The greater the love, the greater the hate or jealousy caused by its frustration and the greater the ambivalence or guilt that may arise in relation to it.” Hate has to be overcome with love by the child removing the cause of the anxiety and hate by restoring harmonious relationships. The feeling of anxiety and hate can then change back into the feeling of love and security. This counts for the situation between mother and child and later for following relationships.

In Suttie’s view, the beginning of the relationship between mother and child is a happy and symbiotic one as well. This happy symbiotic relationship between mother and baby can be disrupted by for example a second baby or the mother returning to work. This makes the infant feel irritable, insecure and anxious. This would be the start of the feeling of [[ambivalence]]: feelings of [[love]] and [[hate]] towards the mother. The child attempts to remove the cause of the anxiety and hate to restore the relationship (retransforming). This retransforming is necessary, because hate of a loved object ([[ambivalence]]) is intolerable.

==In the work of Edith Jacobson==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}

The newborn baby is not able to distinguish the self from others and the relationship with the mother is symbiotic, with the two individuals forming a unique object. In this period, the child generates two different images of the mother.  On one hand there is the loving mother, whose image derives from experiences of love and satisfaction in the relationship with her. On the other hand, there is the bad mother, whose image derives from frustrating and upsetting experiences in the relationship. Since the child at this stage is unable to distinguish the self from the other, those two opposite images are often fused and confused, rather than distinguished. At about six months of age, the child becomes able to distinguish the self from the others. He now understands that his mother can be both gratifying and frustrating, and he starts experiencing himself as being able to feel both love and anger. This ambivalence results in a vacillation between attitudes of passive dependency on the omnipotent mother and aggressive strivings for self expansion and control over the love object. The passive-submissive and active-aggressive behaviour of the child during the [[pre-oedipal]] and the early [[oedipal]] period is determined by his ambivalent emotional fluctuations between loving and trusting admirations of his parents and disappointed depreciation of the loved objects. The [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] can use this ambivalence conflicts to distinguish between the self and the object. At the beginning, the child tends to turn aggression toward the frustrating objects and libido towards the self. Hence, frustration, demands and restrictions imposed by parents within normal bounds, reinforce the process of discovery and distinction of the object and the self. When early experiences of severe disappointment and abandonment have prevented the building up of un-ambivalent object relations and stable identifications and weakened the child’s self-esteem, they may result in ambivalence conflict in adulthood, which in turn causes depressive states.

[[Units of measurement]] used in [[Malaysia]] and neighbouring countries include the ''[[Catty|kati]]'', a unit of [[mass]], and the ''gantang'', a unit of [[volume]].

== Mass ==

In measuring amount by mass, the common unit is ''[[Catty|kati]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singlishdictionary.com/singlish_K.htm#kati "Kati" entry] at A Dictionary of Singlish and Singapore English.&lt;/ref&gt; which is about 1{{fraction|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;lb (604.79 g).&lt;ref name="my_law"&gt;{{cite web|title=Weights and Measures Act 1972 |work=Laws of Malaysia |url=http://www.kpdnkk.gov.my/akta-timbang-dan-sukat-1972 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201182503/http://www.kpdnkk.gov.my/akta-timbang-dan-sukat-1972 |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A higher unit is ''[[Picul|pikul]]'' or ''picul'', which is 100 ''kati'' or {{convert|133.333|lb}}.&lt;ref name="Xinhua Zidian"&gt;新华字典 (''[[Xīnhuá Zìdiǎn]]''), Peking, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Volume ==
{{Other uses|Gantang (disambiguation)}}
In measuring amount by volume, the common unit is ''gantang'' (gallon), which is  equivalent to {{convert|1|impgal|lk=on}} or 8 pints. 
To make it clear,
Gantang equals a Gallon. A Gallon has sub measurements of 4 Quarts, or 8 Pints, or 16 Cups. A Gantang has sub measurements of 4 Churpak, or 8 Leng, or 16 Chentong. 
Churpak equals a Quart.
Leng equals a Pint.
Chentong equals a Cup.&lt;ref&gt;

''Chentong'' is also normally used only in certain areas, and so eight ''leng'' makes up a ''gantang''.

When used to measure unhusked rice, a ''gantang'' weights about {{convert|4|to|5|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4979">{{Other uses|Map (disambiguation)}}

In [[mathematics]], the term '''mapping''', sometimes shortened to '''map''', refers to either a [[Function (mathematics)|function]], often with some sort of special structure, or a [[morphism]] in category theory, which generalizes the idea of a function. There are also a few, less common uses in logic and graph theory.

==Maps as functions==
{{Main article|Function (mathematics)}}

In many branches of mathematics, the term '''map''' is used to mean a [[Function (mathematics)|function]], sometimes with a specific property of particular importance to that branch.  For instance, a "map" is a ''[[continuous function]]'' in [[topology]], a ''[[Linear map|linear transformation]]'' in [[linear algebra]], etc.

Some authors, such as [[Serge Lang]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Serge|last=Lang|title=Linear Algebra|edition=2nd|year=1971|page=83|publisher=Addison-Wesley}}&lt;/ref&gt; use "function" only to refer to maps in which the [[codomain]] is a set of numbers (i.e. a subset of the [[Field (mathematics)|field]]s '''R''' or '''C''') and the term ''mapping'' for more general functions.

Sets of maps of special kinds are the subjects of many important theories: see for instance [[Lie group]], [[mapping class group]], [[permutation group]].&lt;!-- many more to add here--&gt;

In the theory of [[dynamical system]]s, a map denotes an [[Discrete-time dynamical system|evolution function]] used to create [[Dynamical system#Maps|discrete dynamical systems]]. See also [[Poincaré map]].

A ''partial map'' is a ''[[partial function]]'', and a ''total map'' is a ''[[total function]]''. Related terms like ''[[Domain (mathematics)|domain]]'', ''[[codomain]]'', ''[[Injective function|injective]]'', ''[[Continuous function|continuous]]'', etc. can be applied equally to maps and functions, with the same meaning. All these usages can be applied to "maps" as general functions or as functions with special properties.

==Maps as morphisms==
{{Main article|Morphism}}

In [[category theory]], "map" is often used as a synonym for [[morphism]] or arrow, thus for something more general than a function.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=An Introduction to Category Theory|first=H.|last=Simmons|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=9781139503327|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VOCQUC_uiWgC&amp;pg=PA2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, morphisms &lt;math&gt;f\, X\to Y&lt;/math&gt;, in a [[Concrete category| concrete category]], in other words morphisms that can be viewed as functions, carry with them the information of both its domain (the source &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of the morphism), but also its co-domain (the target &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;). In the widely used definition of function &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt;, this is a subset of &lt;math&gt;X\times Y&lt;/math&gt; consisting of all the pairs &lt;math&gt;(x,f(x))&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. In this sense, the function doesn't capture the information of which set &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is used as the co-domain. Only the range &lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the function.

==Other uses==
===In logic===
In [[formal logic]], the term '''map'''  is sometimes used for a ''[[functional predicate]]'', whereas a function is a [[model (logic)|model]] of such a [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]] in [[set theory]].

===In graph theory===
[[File:Dodecahedron schlegel diagram.png|thumb|An example of a map in [[graph theory]]]]

In [[graph theory]], a '''map''' is a drawing of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] on a surface without overlapping edges (an [[Graph embedding|embedding]]). If the surface is a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] then a map is a [[planar graph]], similar to a [[political map]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Jonathan|last1=Gross|first2=Jay|last2=Yellen|title=Graph Theory and its applications|year=1998|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-8493-3982-0|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In computer science===
In the communities surrounding [[programming language]]s that treat functions as [[first-class citizen]]s, a [[Map (higher-order function)|map]] often refers to the [[Binary function|binary]] [[higher-order function]] that takes a function ''f'' and a [[List (abstract data type)|list]] {{nowrap|[''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} as [[Argument of a function|arguments]] and returns {{nowrap|[''f''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), ''f''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., ''f''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)]}}, where {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 0}}.

The '''Movement for Justice''' was set up in 1995 by people around the Kingsway College Student Union in the [[London Borough of Camden]] to tackle racism in institutional and established forms. The group confronted organised [[fascism]] as well as [[death in custody]] and wider racism to black people as well as [[tourism|travellers]], [[refugees]] and [[asylum seekers]]. It is also the sister group to the American organization The Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration &amp; Immigrant Rights, and Fight for Equality By Any Means Necessary ([[BAMN]]). Movement for Justice is headed up by members of the [[Workers' Internationalist League|Revolutionary Internationalist League]] (RIL), a [[Trotskyist]] group.&lt;ref name="Mendick"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mendick|first1=Robert|title=Veteran revolutionary with conviction for attacking Tory chairman behind the Grenfell Tower 'day of rage' protest|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/20/veteran-revolutionary-conviction-attacking-tory-chairman-behind/|accessdate=20 June 2017|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The group first grew following the murder of [[Stephen Lawrence]] and the campaign that followed. The group went on to campaign for justice for the murders by racists and in police custody of many others including [[Rolan Adams]], Michael Tachie-Menson,

The group took part in the demonstrations to close down the [[British National Party]] headquarters in the area and helped the [[Youth against Racism in Europe]] to build an anti-racist campaign through this. They also campaigned with the YRE and local community to fight drove the BNP off [[Brick Lane]].

In 1993 a Kingsway student [[Shah Alam]] was nearly killed in a racist attack in Poplar, East London and they organised the Justice for Shah Alam Campaign which organised a march, public meetings, press conferences and court pickets to get the racists convicted and jailed.

After the death of [[Brian Douglas]] they helped get Lambeth [[Unison]] (public service workers union) and Kingsway College Student Union with the campaign.

The organisation also concentrated on mass non-co-operation with the [[Asylum Bill]] and in September 1995, published a pamphlet "Howard's Racist Immigration and Asylum Bill - What it is and how to fight it". In 1995 the group orchestrated a paint attack on [[Brian Mawhinney]], Tory MP outside Parliament at the state opening and Queen's speech, because of what they saw as his deliberate use of emotive and misrepresentative language about 'British people fearing immigrants flooding the country' which were seen by many as an [[incitement to ethnic or racial hatred|incitement to racial hatred]]. The group continued to oppose immigration, asylum legislation after Labour took power.

After the death of Oscar Okoye the group came under attack from [[Lee Jasper]] and [[Brian Paddick]]. The group's chairman [[Alex Olowade]] was sacked from his job with Lambeth Council.

In 2001 after the police shot dead a man with a replica gun cigarette lighter in Brixton, the group organised a demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jul/17/ukguns ‘Demonstration planned after police shooting’], ''The Guardian'', 17 July 2001 (accessed 11 April 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstration was covered by the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1450042.stm ‘Brixton violence 'against racist police'’], ''BBC News'', 21 July 2001 (accessed 13 April 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible infiltration by undercover police==
Former [[Metropolitan Police]] [[Special Branch]] undercover officer Peter Francis, who as part of the secretive [[Special Demonstration Squad]] infiltrated the [[Youth against Racism in Europe|YRE]] and associated groups between 1993 and 1997, claimed in a 2014 statement issued through his solicitor that he had been a founding member of Movement for Justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leighday.co.uk/News/2014/July-2014/Statement-on-behalf-of-Peter-Francis-following-pub ‘Statement on behalf of Peter Francis following publication of the Creedon Report’], Leigh Day website, 29 July 2014 (accessed 30 July 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent activities==
The group organised the first London student civil rights conference on 13 July 2006{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} and according to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' was the key organiser behind the "Day of Rage" protests following the [[Grenfell Tower fire]].&lt;ref name="Mendick" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11943">The possibility that there might be '''more than one dimension of time''' has occasionally been discussed in [[physics]] and [[philosophy]].

== Physics ==

[[Special relativity]] describes [[spacetime]] as a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|manifold]] whose [[metric tensor]] has a negative [[eigenvalue]]. This corresponds to the existence of a "time-like" direction. A metric with multiple negative eigenvalues would correspondingly imply ''several'' timelike directions, i.e. multiple time dimensions, but there is no consensus regarding the relationship of these extra "times" to time as conventionally understood.

If the special theory of relativity can be generalized for the case of ''k''-dimensional time (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) and ''n''-dimensional space (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k'' + 2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,  ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k'' + ''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), then the (''k'' + ''n'')-dimensional interval, being invariant, is given by the expression

:(d''s''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (''c''d''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + (''c''d''t''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − (d''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − … − (d''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The [[metric signature]] will be

:&lt;math&gt;(\underbrace{+,\cdots,+}_{k},\underbrace{-,\cdots,-}_{n})&lt;/math&gt;  (timelike [[sign convention]])
or
:&lt;math&gt;(\underbrace{-,\cdots,-}_{k},\underbrace{+,\cdots,+}_{n})&lt;/math&gt; (spacelike sign convention).

The transformations between the two inertial frames of reference ''K'' and ''K''′, which are in a standard configuration (i.e., transformations without translations and/or rotations of the space axis in the [[hyperplane]] of [[space]] and/or rotations of the  time axis in the hyperplane of time), are given as follows:&lt;ref name="Milen2012"&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;t'_{\sigma} = \sum_{\theta=1}^k \left(\delta_{\sigma\theta} t_\theta + \frac{c^2}{v_\sigma v_{\theta}} \beta^2(\zeta-1) t_\theta\right) - \frac{1}{v_\sigma}\beta^2 \zeta x_{k+1},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x'_\lambda = x_\lambda,&lt;/math&gt;

where
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_1 = (v_1,\underbrace{0,\cdots,0}_{n-1}),&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_2 = (v_2,\underbrace{0,\cdots,0}_{n-1}),&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sum_{\mu=1}^k \frac{c^2}{v^2_\mu}}};&lt;/math&gt;

''σ'' = 1, 2, ..., ''k''; ''λ'' = ''k''+2, ''k''+3, ..., ''k''+''n''. Here ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''σθ''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]]. These transformations are generalization of the [[Lorentz boost]] in a fixed space direction (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;) in the field of the multidimensional [[time]] and multidimensional space.

[[File:Causal structure of a space-time with two time dimensions and one space dimension.png|thumb|Causal structure of a space-time with two time dimensions and one space dimension]]
Let us denote
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx_\eta}{dt_\sigma} = V_{\sigma\eta}&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx'_\eta}{dt'_\sigma} = V'_{\sigma\eta},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''σ'' = 1, 2, ..., ''k''; ''η'' = ''k''+1, ''k''+2, ..., ''k''+''n''. The [[velocity-addition formula]] is then given by

:&lt;math&gt;V'_{\sigma(k+1)} = \frac{V_{\sigma(k+1)}\zeta\left(1 - \beta^2\sum_{\theta=1}^k \frac{c^2}{v_\theta V_{\theta(k+1)}}\right)}{1 + \frac  {V_{\sigma(k+1)}}{v_\sigma}\beta^2\left((\zeta-1)\sum_{\theta=1}^k \frac{c^2}{v_\theta V_{\theta(k+1)}} - \zeta\right)},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V'_{\sigma \lambda} = \frac{V_{\sigma \lambda}}{1 + \frac{V_{\sigma(k+1)}}{v_\sigma}\beta^2\left((\zeta-1)\sum_{\theta=1}^k \frac{c^2}{v_\theta V_{\theta(k+1)}} - \zeta\right)},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ'' = 1, 2, ..., ''k''; ''λ'' = ''k''+2, ''k''+3, ..., ''k''+''n''.

For simplicity, let us consider only one spatial [[dimension]] ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the two time dimensions ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. (E. g., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''ct''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''ct''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''.) Let us assume that in point ''O'', having coordinates ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, there has been an event ''E''. Let us further assume that a given interval of time &lt;math&gt;\Delta T = \sqrt{(\Delta t_1)^2 + (\Delta t_2)^2} \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; has passed since the event ''E''. The causal region connected to the event ''E'' includes the [[lateral surface]] of the [[right circular cone]] {(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − (''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0}, the lateral surface of the [[right circular cylinder]] {(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Δ''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;} and the inner region bounded by these surfaces, i.e., the causal region includes all points (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), for which the conditions

Theories with more than one dimension of time have sometimes been advanced in physics, whether as a serious description of reality or just as a curious possibility. [[Itzhak Bars]]'s work on "two-time physics",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physics.usc.edu/~bars/twoTph.htm |title=Two-Time Physics |last1=Bars |first1=Itzhak |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the SO(10,2) symmetry of the extended supersymmetry structure of [[M-theory]], is the most recent and systematic development of the concept (see also [[F-theory]]).  Walter Craig and Steven Weinstein proved the existence of a well-posed initial value problem for the [[ultrahyperbolic equation]] (a wave equation in more than one time dimension).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/465/2110/3023 | title = On determinism and well-posedness in multiple time dimensions | publisher = Proc. R. Soc. A  vol. 465 no. 2110 3023-3046 (2008) | last1= Craig | first1 = Walter | last2 = Weinstein | first2 = Steven | accessdate = 5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This showed that initial data on a mixed (spacelike and timelike) hypersurface obeying a particular nonlocal constraint evolves deterministically in the remaining time dimension.

=== Connection to the Planck length and the speed of light ===

Let us regard the motion of a test particle with coordinate

&lt;math&gt; x^{\mu} = \begin{pmatrix} ct \\ r\cdot f\left(\frac{\gamma\tau}{\Lambda}\right) \\ \mathbf{x} \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

which is the canonical (1,3) spacetime vector &lt;math&gt; (ct, \mathbf{x})^{T} &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; x \in \R^3 &lt;/math&gt; extended by an additional timelike coordinate &lt;math&gt; r \cdot f (\gamma\tau /\Lambda)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt; \tau &lt;/math&gt; is the second time parameter, &lt;math&gt; r\in \R&lt;/math&gt; describes the size of the second time dimension and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic velocity, thus the equivalent of &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; describes the shape of the second time dimension and &lt;math&gt; \Lambda\in \R&lt;/math&gt; is a normalization parameter such that &lt;math&gt; \gamma\tau/\Lambda &lt;/math&gt; is dimensionless. Decomposing &lt;math&gt; x^{\mu}=x^{\mu}_t + x^{\mu}_{\tau} &lt;/math&gt; with 

&lt;math&gt; x^{\mu}_t = \begin {pmatrix} ct \\ 0 \\ \eta\mathbf{x} \end{pmatrix};\ x^{\mu}_{\tau} = \begin {pmatrix} 0 \\ r\cdot f\left(\frac{\gamma\tau}{\Lambda}\right) \\ (1-\eta)\mathbf{x} \end{pmatrix}, \eta\in(0,1) &lt;/math&gt;

and using the metric &lt;math&gt; (+,+,-,-,-) &lt;/math&gt;, the [[Lagrangian_mechanics | Lagrangian]] becomes

&lt;math&gt; L(x,\dot{x},x^{\prime},t,\tau)=\frac{r}{\Lambda}\sqrt{\dot{c}^2t^2+c^2-\eta^2\dot{\mathbf{x}}^2+2\dot{c}ct}\sqrt{(\gamma^{\prime 2}\tau^2+\gamma^2+2\gamma
\gamma^{\prime}\tau)\left(\left.\frac{df}{dz}\right|_{z=\frac{\gamma\tau}{\Lambda}}\right)^{2}-(1-\eta)^2\mathbf{x}^{\prime 2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

Applying the [[Euler-Lagrange Equations]]

&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}_i}+\frac{d}{d\tau}\frac{\partial L}{\partial x^{\prime\ }_i}-\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i}=0 &lt;/math&gt;

the existence of the [[Planck length]] and the constancy of the [[speed of light]] can be derived.{{cn|date=November 2017|reason=source originally cited was not reliable}}

As a consequence of this model it has been suggested that the speed of light may not have been constant in the early universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A Time Varying Speed of Light as a Solution to Cosmological Puzzles | publisher = Phys. Rev. D vol. 59 043516 (1999) | last1= Albrecht | first1 = A. | last2=Magueijo | first2= J. |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Conceptual difficulties with multiple physical time dimensions have been raised in modern [[analytic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fqxi.org/community/essay/winners/2008.1#Weinstein | last1 = Weinstein | first1 = Steven | title = Many Times | publisher=Foundational Questions Institute |accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a solution to the problem of the subjective passage of time, [[J. W. Dunne]] proposed an infinite hierarchy of time dimensions, inhabited by a similar hierarchy of levels of consciousness. Dunne suggested that, in the context of a "block" spacetime as modelled by [[General Relativity]], a second dimension of time was needed in order to measure the speed of one's progress along one's own timeline. This in turn required a level of the conscious self existing at the second level of time. But the same arguments then applied to this new level, requiring a third level, and so on in an [[infinite regress]]. At the end of the regress was a "superlative general observer" who existed in [[eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sprg.ssl.berkeley.edu/~jmcd/book/revs3/aewt.html |title=John's Book Reviews: An Experiment with Time |last1=McDonald |first1=John Q. |date=15 November 2006 |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published his theory in relation to [[precognition|precognitive]] dreams in his 1927 book ''[[An Experiment with Time]]'' and went on to explore its relevance to contemporary physics in ''The Serial Universe'' (1934). His infinite regress was criticised as logically flawed and unnecessary, although writers such as [[J. B. Priestley]] acknowledged the possibility of his second time dimension.&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Gunn; ''The Problem of Time'', Unwin, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Priestley, ''Man and Time'', Aldus, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Möbius strip''' or '''Möbius band''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|m|ɜː|b|i|ə|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|m|oʊ|-|,_|ˈ|m|eɪ|-|}}; {{IPA-de|ˈmøːbi̯ʊs|lang}}), also spelled '''Mobius''' or '''Moebius''', is a [[Surface (topology)|surface]] with only one side (when embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space) and only one [[boundary (topology)|boundary]]. The Möbius strip has the [[Mathematics|mathematical]] property of being [[orientability|unorientable]]. It can be realized as a [[ruled surface]]. Its discovery is attributed to the German [[mathematician]]s [[August Ferdinand Möbius]] and [[Johann Benedict Listing]] in 1858,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

An example of a Möbius strip can be created by taking a paper strip and giving it a half-twist, and then joining the ends of the strip to form a loop. However, the Möbius strip is not a surface of only one exact size and shape, such as the half-twisted paper strip depicted in the illustration.  Rather, mathematicians refer to the closed Möbius band as any surface that is [[homeomorphic]] to this strip.  Its boundary is a simple closed curve, i.e., homeomorphic to a circle. This allows for a very wide variety of geometric versions of the Möbius band as surfaces each having a definite size and shape.   For example, any rectangle can be glued to itself (by identifying one edge with the opposite edge after a reversal of orientation) to make a Möbius band.  Some of these can be smoothly modeled in  [[Euclidean space]], and others cannot.

A half-twist [[clockwise]] gives an embedding of the Möbius strip different from that of a half-twist counterclockwise – that is, as an embedded object in Euclidean space, the Möbius strip is a [[chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] object with right- or left-handedness. However, the underlying [[topological space]]s within the Möbius strip are homeomorphic in each case. An infinite number of topologically different embeddings of the same topological space into three-dimensional space exist, as the Möbius strip can also be formed by twisting the strip an odd number of times greater than one, or by knotting and twisting the strip, before joining its ends.  The complete open Möbius band is an example of a topological surface that is closely related to the standard Möbius strip, but that is not homeomorphic to it.

Finding [[algebraic variety|algebraic equations]], the solutions of which have the topology of a Möbius strip, is straightforward, but, in general, these equations do not describe the same geometric shape that one gets from the twisted paper model described above.  In particular, the twisted paper model is a [[developable surface]], having zero [[Gaussian curvature]].  A system of [[differential-algebraic equation]]s that describes models of this type was published in 2007 together with its numerical solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Starostin E.L. |author2=van der Heijden G.H.M. | title=The shape of a Möbius strip | journal=[[Nature Materials]] | url=http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v6/n8/abs/nmat1929.html | year=2007 | doi=10.1038/nmat1929 | volume = 6 | pages = 563–7 | pmid=17632519 | issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Euler characteristic]] of the Möbius strip is [[zero]].

==Properties==
[[File:Moebiusband-1s.svg|thumb|once cut Möbius strip: one non Möbius strip]]
[[File:Moebiusband-2s.svg|thumb|twice cut Möbius strip: one Möbius strip (purple), one non Möbius strip]]
The Möbius strip has several curious properties. A line drawn starting from the seam down the middle meets back at the seam, but at the other side. If continued, the line meets the starting point, and is double the length of the original strip. This single continuous curve demonstrates that the Möbius strip has only one [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]].

Cutting a Möbius strip along the center line with a pair of scissors yields one long strip with two full twists in it, rather than two separate strips; the result is not a Möbius strip. This happens because the original strip only has one edge that is twice as long as the original strip.  Cutting creates a second independent edge, half of which was on each side of the scissors. Cutting this new, longer, strip down the middle creates two strips wound around each other, each with two full twists.

If the strip is cut along about a third of the way in from the edge, it creates two strips: One is a thinner Möbius strip – it is the center third of the original strip, comprising one-third of the width and the same length as the original strip. The other is a longer but thin strip with two full twists in it – this is a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of the edge of the original strip, and it comprises one-third of the width and twice the length of the original strip.

Other analogous strips can be obtained by similarly joining strips with two or more half-twists in them instead of one. For example, a strip with three half-twists, when divided lengthwise, becomes a twisted strip tied in a [[trefoil knot]]. (If this knot is unravelled, the strip has eight half-twists.)  A strip with ''N'' half-twists, when bisected, becomes a strip with ''N'' + 1 full twists.  Giving it extra twists and reconnecting the ends produces figures called [[paradromic ring]]s.

One way to represent the Möbius strip as a subset of three-dimensional Euclidean space is using the parametrization:

:&lt;math&gt;x(u,v)= \left(1+\frac{v}{2} \cos \frac{u}{2}\right)\cos u&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y(u,v)= \left(1+\frac{v}{2} \cos\frac{u}{2}\right)\sin u&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z(u,v)= \frac{v}{2}\sin \frac{u}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;0 \le u&lt; 2\pi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-1 \le v\le 1&lt;/math&gt;. This creates a Möbius strip of width 1 whose center circle has radius 1, lies in the &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt;-plane and is centered at &lt;math&gt;(0, 0, 0)&lt;/math&gt;. The parameter &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; runs around the strip while &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; moves from one edge to the other.

In [[cylindrical coordinates|cylindrical polar coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;(r, \theta, z)&lt;/math&gt;, an unbounded version of the Möbius strip can be represented by the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\log(r)\sin\left(\frac{1}{2}\theta\right)=z\cos\left(\frac{1}{2}\theta\right).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Widest isometric embedding in 3-space ===
If a smooth Möbius strip in three-space is a rectangular one – that is, created from identifying two opposite sides of a geometrical rectangle with bending but not stretching the surface – then such an embedding is known to be possible if the aspect ratio of the rectangle is greater than the square root of three. (Note the shorter sides of the rectangle are identified to obtain the Möbius strip.) For an aspect ratio less than or equal to the square root of three, however, a smooth embedding of a rectangular Möbius strip into three-space may be impossible.

As the aspect ratio approaches the limiting ratio of {{sqrt|3}} from above, any such rectangular Möbius strip in three-space seems to approach a shape that in the limit can be thought of as a strip of three equilateral triangles, folded on top of one another so that they occupy just one equilateral triangle in three-space.

If the Möbius strip in three-space is only once continuously differentiable (in symbols: C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;), however, then the theorem of Nash-Kuiper shows that no lower bound exists.

A method of making a Möbius strip from a rectangular strip too wide to simply twist and join (e.g., a rectangle only one unit long and one unit wide) is to first fold the wide direction back and forth using an even number of folds—an "accordion fold"—so that the folded strip becomes narrow enough that it can be twisted and joined, much as a single long-enough strip can be joined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Barr  |first = Stephen  |title = Experiments in Topology  |year = 1964 |publisher = Thomas Y. Crowell Company |location = New York |pages = 48,200–201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With two folds, for example, a {{nowrap|1 × 1}} strip would become a {{nowrap|1 × ⅓}} folded strip whose [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]] is in the shape of an 'N' and would remain an 'N' after a half-twist. This folded strip, three times as long as it is wide, would be long enough to then join at the ends. This method works in principle, but becomes impractical after sufficiently many folds, if paper is used. Using normal paper, this construction can be [[Mathematics of paper folding#Flat folding|folded flat]], with all the layers of the paper in a single plane, but mathematically, whether this is possible without stretching the surface of the rectangle is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;Dmitry Fuchs and [[Serge Tabachnikov]], ''Mathematical Omnibus: Thirty Lectures on Classic Mathematics'', 2007, page 199, at http://www.math.psu.edu/tabachni/Books/taba.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Topology ===
[[Topology|Topologically]], the Möbius strip can be defined as the [[square (geometry)|square]] &lt;math&gt;[0, 1] \times [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; with its top and bottom sides [[Quotient space (topology)|identified]] by the relation &lt;math&gt;(x, 0) \sim (1 - x, 1)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;0 \le x \le 1&lt;/math&gt;, as in the diagram on the right.

A less used presentation of the Möbius strip is as the topological quotient of a torus.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Phillips, ''[http://www.ams.org/mathmedia/archive/10-2006-media.html Tony Phillips' Take on Math in the Media],'' [[American Mathematical Society]], October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A torus can be constructed as the square &lt;math&gt;[0, 1] \times [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; with the edges identified as &lt;math&gt;(0, y) \sim (1, y)&lt;/math&gt; (glue left to right) and &lt;math&gt;(x, 0) \sim (x, 1)&lt;/math&gt; (glue bottom to top). If one then also identified {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'') ~ (''y'', ''x'')}}, then one obtains the Möbius strip. The diagonal of the square (the points {{nowrap|(''x'', ''x'')}} where both coordinates agree) becomes the boundary of the Möbius strip, and carries an orbifold structure, which geometrically corresponds to "reflection" – [[geodesic]]s (straight lines) in the Möbius strip reflect off the edge back into the strip. Notationally, this is written as T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; – the 2-torus quotiented by the [[group action]] of the [[symmetric group]] on two letters (switching coordinates), and it can be thought of as the [[Configuration space (mathematics)|configuration space]] of two unordered points on the circle, possibly the same (the edge corresponds to the points being the same), with the torus corresponding to two ordered points on the circle.

The Möbius strip is a two-dimensional [[compact manifold]] (i.e. a [[Surface (topology)|surface]]) with boundary. It is a standard example of a surface that is not [[orientable manifold|orientable]]. In fact, the Möbius strip is the epitome of the topological phenomenon of [[Orientability|nonorientability]].  This is because two-dimensional shapes (surfaces) are the lowest-dimensional shapes for which nonorientability is possible and the Möbius strip is the '''only''' surface that is topologically a subspace of '''every''' nonorientable surface. As a result, any surface is nonorientable if and only if it contains a Möbius band as a subspace.

The Möbius strip is also a standard example used to illustrate the mathematical concept of a [[fiber bundle]]. Specifically, it is a nontrivial bundle over the circle ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a fiber the [[unit interval]], {{nowrap|1=''I'' = [0, 1]}}. Looking only at the edge of the Möbius strip gives a nontrivial two point (or '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;!-- What is Z2??--&gt;) bundle over ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Computer graphics ===
A simple construction of the Möbius strip that can be used to portray it in computer graphics or modeling packages is:
* Take a rectangular strip. Rotate it around a fixed point not in its plane. At every step, also rotate the strip along a line in its plane (the line that divides the strip in two) and perpendicular to the main orbital radius. The surface generated on one complete revolution is the Möbius strip.
* Take a Möbius strip and cut it along the middle of the strip.  This forms a new strip, which is a rectangle joined by rotating one end a whole turn.  By cutting it down the middle again, this forms two interlocking whole-turn strips.

=== Open Möbius band ===
The '''open Möbius band''' is formed by deleting the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the standard Möbius band. It is constructed from the set {{nowrap|1=''S'' = { (''x'', ''y'') ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; : 0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 1 and 0 &lt; ''y'' &lt; 1 } }} by identifying (glueing) the points {{nowrap|(0, ''y'')}} and {{nowrap|(1, 1 − ''y'')}} for all {{nowrap|1=0 &lt; ''y'' &lt; 1}}.

It may be constructed as a surface of constant positive, negative, or zero (Gaussian) [[Gaussian curvature|curvature]]. In the cases of negative and zero curvature, the Möbius band can be constructed as a (geodesically) complete surface, which means that all geodesics ("straight lines" on the surface) may be extended indefinitely in either direction.

'''Constant negative curvature:'''
Like the plane and the open cylinder, the open Möbius band admits not only a complete metric of constant curvature 0, but also a complete metric of constant negative curvature, say −1.  One way to see this is to begin with the [[Poincaré half-plane model|upper half plane (Poincaré) model]] of the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]] ℍ, namely {{nowrap|1=ℍ = { (''x'', ''y'') ∈ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{pipe}} ''y'' &gt; 0} }} with the [[Riemannian metric]] given by {{nowrap|(''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; +  ''dy''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) / ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  The orientation-preserving isometries of this metric are all the maps {{nowrap|''f'' : ℍ → ℍ}} of the form {{nowrap|1=''f''(''z'') := (''az'' + ''b'') / (''cz'' + ''d'')}}, where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' are real numbers satisfying {{nowrap|1=''ad'' − ''bc'' = 1}}. Here ''z'' is a complex number with {{nowrap|Im(''z'') &gt; 0}}, and we have identified ℍ with {{nowrap|{''z'' ∈ ℂ {{pipe}} Im(''z'') &gt; 0} }} endowed with the Riemannian metric that was mentioned.  Then one orientation-reversing isometry ''g'' of ℍ given by {{nowrap|1=''g''(''z'') := -conj(''z'')}}, where conj(''z'') denotes the complex conjugate of ''z''.  These facts imply that the mapping {{nowrap|''h'' : ℍ → ℍ}} given by {{nowrap|1=''h''(''z'') := −2⋅conj(''z'')}} is an orientation-reversing isometry of ℍ that generates an infinite cyclic group ''G'' of isometries. (Its square is the isometry  {{nowrap|1=''h''(''z'') := 4⋅z}}, which can be expressed as {{nowrap|1=(''2z'' + ''0'') / (''0z'' + ''1/2'')}}.) The quotient {{nowrap|ℍ / ''G''}} of the action of this group can easily be seen to be topologically a Möbius band. But it is also easy to verify that it is complete and non-compact, with constant negative curvature −1.

The group of isometries of this Möbius band is 1-dimensional and is isomorphic to the special orthogonal group SO(2).

'''(Constant) zero curvature:'''
This may also be constructed as a complete surface, by starting with portion of the plane '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; defined by {{nowrap|0 ≤ y ≤ 1}} and identifying {{nowrap|(''x'', 0)}} with {{nowrap|(−''x'', 1)}} for all ''x'' in '''R''' (the reals). The resulting metric makes the open Möbius band into a (geodesically) complete flat surface (i.e., having Gaussian curvature equal to 0 everywhere). This is the only metric on the Möbius band, up to uniform scaling, that is both flat and complete.

The group of isometries of this Möbius band is 1-dimensional and is isomorphic to the orthogonal group SO(2).

'''Constant positive curvature:'''
A Möbius band of constant positive curvature cannot be complete, since it is known that the only complete surfaces of constant positive curvature are the sphere and the [[Real projective plane|projective plane]].  The projective plane '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of constant curvature +1 may be constructed as the quotient of the unit sphere ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; by the antipodal map ''A'': ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, defined by {{nowrap|1=''A''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') = (−''x'', −''y'', −''z'')}}.  The open Möbius band is homeomorphic to the once-punctured projective plane, that is, '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with any one point removed.  This may be thought of as the closest that a Möbius band of constant positive curvature can get to being a complete surface: just one point away.

The group of isometries of this Möbius band is also 1-dimensional and isomorphic to the orthogonal group O(2).

The space of unoriented lines in the plane is [[diffeomorphic]] to the open Möbius band.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=Phillip|year=1993|title=Spaces of Geodesics|journal=Aportaciones Matemáticas|series=Notas de Investigación|pages=67–79|publisher=UASLP|url=http://www.math.wichita.edu/~pparker/research/sog.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; To see why, let ''L''(''θ'') denote the line through the origin at an angle ''θ'' to the positive x-axis.  For each ''L''(''θ'') there is the family ''P''(''θ'') of all lines in the plane that are perpendicular to ''L''(''θ'').  Topologically, the family ''P''(''θ'') is just a line (because each line in ''P''(''θ'') intersects the line ''L''(''θ'') in just one point).  In this way, as ''θ'' increases in the range {{nowrap|0° ≤ ''θ'' &lt; 180°}}, the line ''L''(''θ'') represents a line's worth of distinct lines in the plane. But when ''θ'' reaches 180°, ''L''(180°) is identical to ''L''(0), and so the families ''P''(0°) and ''P''(180°) of perpendicular lines are also identical families.  The line ''L''(0°), however, has returned to itself as ''L''(180°) ''pointed in the opposite direction''. Every line in the plane corresponds to exactly one line in some family ''P''(''θ''), for exactly one ''θ'', for {{nowrap|0° ≤ ''θ'' &lt; 180°}}, and ''P''(180°) is identical to ''P''(0°) but returns pointed in the opposite direction.  This ensures that the space of all lines in the plane – the union of all the ''L''(''θ'') for {{nowrap|0° ≤ ''θ'' ≤ 180°}} – is an open Möbius band.

The group of bijective linear transformations {{nowrap|GL(2, '''R''')}} of the plane to itself (real {{nowrap|2 × 2}} matrices with non-zero determinant) naturally induces bijections of '''the space of lines in the plane''' to itself, which form a group of self-homeomorphisms of the space of lines.  Hence the same group forms a group of self-homeomorphisms of the Möbius band described in the previous paragraph.  But there is no metric on the space of lines in the plane that is invariant under the action of this group of homeomorphisms. In this sense, the space of lines in the plane has no natural metric on it.

This means that the Möbius band possesses a natural 4-dimensional [[Lie group]] of self-homeomorphisms, given by {{nowrap|GL(2, '''R''')}}, but this high degree of symmetry cannot be exhibited as the group of isometries of any metric.

===Möbius band with round boundary===
The edge, or [[boundary (topology)|boundary]], of a Möbius strip is [[homeomorphic]] (topologically equivalent) to a [[circle]].  Under the usual embeddings of the strip in Euclidean space, as above, the boundary is not a true circle.  However, it is possible to [[embedding|embed]] a Möbius strip in three dimensions so that the boundary is a perfect circle lying in some plane.  For example, see Figures 307, 308, and 309 of "Geometry and the imagination".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A much more geometric embedding begins with a minimal [[Klein bottle]] immersed in the 3-sphere, as discovered by Blaine Lawson.  We then take half of this Klein bottle to get a Möbius band embedded in the 3-sphere (the unit sphere in 4-space). The result is sometimes called the "Sudanese Möbius Band"
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; where "sudanese" refers not to the country [[Sudan]] but to the names of two topologists, Sue Goodman and Daniel Asimov.  Applying stereographic projection to the Sudanese band places it in 3-dimensional space, as can be seen below – a version due to George Francis can be found [http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/graphics/pix/Special_Topics/Differential_Geometry/illiview.html here].

From Lawson's minimal Klein bottle we derive an embedding of the band into the [[3-sphere]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, regarded as a subset of '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is geometrically the same as '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.  We map angles ''η'', ''φ'' to complex numbers ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via
:&lt;math&gt;z_1 = \sin\eta\,e^{i\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_2 = \cos\eta\,e^{i\varphi/2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Here the parameter ''η'' runs from 0 to ''π'' and ''φ'' runs from 0 to 2''π''. Since {{nowrap|1={{abs|&amp;thinsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + {{abs|&amp;thinsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}, the embedded surface lies entirely in ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The boundary of the strip is given by {{nowrap|1={{abs|&amp;thinsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;}} = 1}} (corresponding to {{nowrap|1=''η'' = 0, ''π''}}), which is clearly a circle on the 3-sphere.

To obtain an embedding of the Möbius strip in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; one maps ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; via a [[stereographic projection]]. The projection point can be any point on ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; that does not lie on the embedded Möbius strip (this rules out all the usual projection points). One possible choice is &lt;math&gt;\left\{1/\sqrt{2},i/\sqrt{2}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;. Stereographic projections map circles to circles and preserves the circular boundary of the strip. The result is a smooth embedding of the Möbius strip into '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with a circular edge and no self-intersections.

[[File:MobiusSnail2B.png|center|580px]]

The Sudanese Möbius band in the three-sphere ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is geometrically a fibre bundle over a great circle, whose fibres are great semicircles.  The most symmetrical image of a stereographic projection of this band into '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is obtained by using a projection point that lies on that great circle that runs through the midpoint of each of the semicircles. Each choice of such a projection point results in an image that is congruent to any other. But because such a projection point lies on the Möbius band itself, two aspects of the image are significantly different from the case (illustrated above) where the point is not on the band: 1) the image in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is not the full Möbius band, but rather the band with one point removed (from its centerline); and 2) the image is unbounded – and as it gets increasingly far from the origin of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, it increasingly approximates a plane.  Yet this version of the stereographic image has a group of 4 symmetries in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (it is isomorphic to the [[Klein 4-group]]), as compared with the bounded version illustrated above having its group of symmetries the unique group of order 2. (If all symmetries and not just orientation-preserving isometries of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are allowed, the numbers of symmetries in each case doubles.)

But the most geometrically symmetrical version of all is the original Sudanese Möbius band in the three-sphere ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, where its full group of symmetries is isomorphic to the Lie group O(2). Having an infinite cardinality (that of the [[Continuum (set theory)|continuum]]), this is far larger than the symmetry group of any possible embedding of the Möbius band in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Related objects==
A closely related 'strange' geometrical object is the [[Klein bottle]]. A Klein bottle can be produced by gluing two Möbius strips together along their edges; this cannot be done in ordinary three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] without creating self-intersections.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Going in the other direction, if one glues a disk to a Möbius strip by identifying their boundaries, the result is the projective plane. To visualize this, it is helpful to deform the Möbius strip so that its boundary is an ordinary circle (see above). The real projective plane, like the Klein bottle, cannot be embedded in three-dimensions without self-intersections.

In [[graph theory]], the [[Möbius ladder]] is a [[cubic graph]] closely related to the Möbius strip.

In 1968, Gonzalo Vélez Jahn (UCV, Caracas, Venezuela) discovered three dimensional bodies with Möbian characteristics;&lt;ref&gt;[http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/VelezJahnsMoebiusToroidalPolyhedron/ Wolfram Demonstration Project:  Vélez-Jahn's Möbius Toroidal Polyhedron]&lt;/ref&gt; these were later described by [[Martin Gardner]] as prismatic rings that became toroidal polyhedrons in his August 1978 [[Mathematical Games column]] in Scientific American.&lt;ref&gt;This was the third time Gardner had featured the Möbius strip in his column.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Moebiusstripscarf.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Mathematics and art|Mathematical art]]: a [[scarf]] designed as a Möbius strip]]
There have been several technical applications for the Möbius strip.  Giant Möbius strips have been used as [[conveyor belt]]s that last longer because the entire surface area of the belt gets the same amount of wear, and as continuous-loop recording tapes (to double the playing time).  Möbius strips are common in the manufacture of fabric computer printer and [[typewriter ribbon]]s, as they let the ribbon be twice as wide as the print head while using both halves evenly.&lt;ref&gt;Hogarth, Ian W. and Kiewning, Friedhelm. (1991) "Typewriter or printer ribbon and method for its manufacture" {{US Patent|5062725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Möbius resistor]] is an electronic circuit element that cancels its own inductive reactance. [[Nikola Tesla]] patented similar technology in 1894:&lt;ref&gt;Tesla, Nikola (1894) "Coil for Electro-Magnets" {{US Patent|512340}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Coil for Electro Magnets" was intended for use with his system of global transmission of electricity without wires.

The Möbius strip is the [[Configuration space (mathematics)|configuration space]] of two unordered points on a circle.  Consequently, in [[music theory]], the space of all two-note chords, known as [[Dyad (music)|dyads]], takes the shape of a Möbius strip; this and generalizations to more points is a significant [[Orbifold#Music theory|application of orbifolds to music theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/080507-math-music.html Clara Moskowitz, Music Reduced to Beautiful Math, LiveScience]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Dmitri Tymoczko |title= The Geometry of Musical Chords |date= 7 July 2006 |volume= 313 |issue= 5783 |pages= 72–4 |journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] |doi= 10.1126/science.1126287 |pmid= 16825563|bibcode= 2006Sci...313...72T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economics]], a '''negative income tax''' ('''NIT''') is a welfare system within an income tax where people earning below a certain amount receive supplemental pay from the government instead of paying taxes to the government.

Such a system has been discussed by economists but never fully implemented. According to surveys however, the consensus view among economists is that the "government should restructure the welfare system along the lines" of one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Mankiw|first=N.

Negative income taxes can implement a [[basic income]] or supplement a [[guaranteed minimum income]] system.

In a negative income tax system, people earning a certain income level would owe no taxes; those earning more than that would pay a proportion of their income above that level; and those below that level would receive a payment of a proportion of their shortfall, which is the amount their income falls below that level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shindler|first1=Michael|title=Replace Welfare With a Negative Income Tax|url=http://economics21.org/commentary/replace-welfare-negative-income-tax|website=Economics 21|publisher=The Manhattan Institute for Policy Research|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General welfare==
A negative income tax is intended to create a single system that would not only pay for government, but would also fulfill the social goal of making sure that there was a minimum level of income for all. It is theorized that, with an NIT, the need for [[minimum wage]], food stamps, welfare, social security programs and other government assistance programs could be eliminated, thus reducing the administrative effort and cost to a fraction of what it is under the current system, as well as eliminating the [[perverse incentive]]s created by these overlapping aid programs, e.g. when a minimum wage worker who earns a little more nets out with less income because they are newly ineligible for aid. Theoretically, the worker would then be stuck in a [[welfare trap]] and would have no incentive to seek higher wages.

A NIT does not disrupt low-wage markets, whereas a minimum wage law makes certain that people whose skills are not sufficient to justify that kind of wage will go unemployed. A NIT would therefore increase the availability of cheap labor, which would enable businesses to do domestically some of the work which they would otherwise have to outsource to other countries.

A NIT could reduce administrative overhead, since the large bureaucracies responsible for administering taxation and welfare systems, with the multitude of rules, thresholds and different applications required, could be greatly reduced or eliminated. The savings from this could then be returned to the people through spending on different government activities, via tax cuts, or any array of different ways.

== Specific models ==

Various different models of negative income tax have been proposed.

One model was proposed by [[Milton Friedman]].&lt;ref name=capitalism_and_freedom /&gt;&lt;ref name=essence_friedman /&gt;  In this version, a specified proportion of unused deductions or allowances would be refunded to the taxpayer. If, for a family of four the amount of allowances came out to $10,000, and the subsidy rate was 50%, and the family earned $6,000, the family would receive $2,000, because it left $4,000 of allowances unused, and therefore qualifies for $2,000, half that amount. Friedman feared that subsidy rates any higher would lessen the incentive to obtain employment. He also warned that the negative income tax, as an addition to the "ragbag" of [[Welfare state|welfare]] and assistance programs, would only worsen the problem of bureaucracy and waste. Instead, he argued, the negative income tax should immediately replace all other welfare and assistance programs on the way to a completely [[laissez-faire]] society where all welfare is privately administered. The negative income tax has come up in one form or another in [[United States Congress|Congress]], but Friedman eventually opposed it because it came packaged with other undesirable elements antithetical to the efficacy of the negative income tax. Friedman preferred to have no income tax at all, but said he did not think it was politically feasible at that time to eliminate it, so he suggested this as a less harmful income tax scheme.&lt;ref name=free_to_choose /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frank|first=Robert H|date=2006-11-23 |title=The Other Milton Friedman: A Conservative With a Social Welfare Program |journal=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/23/business/23scene.html?_r=2|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flat tax with negative income tax ===

The effort for reporting and supervision can be significantly reduced by combining basic income with flat income tax. The relationship between gross and net income for individuals can be adjusted to correspond roughly to current relationship at all income levels, implying that income tax is effectively progressive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-graz.at/~parncutt/BIFT2.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514152858/http://www.uni-graz.at/~parncutt/BIFT2.html |date=May 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[flat tax|flat rate income taxation]] with [[tax exemption]] implements a negative income tax as well as maintaining an actual tax rate progression at extremely low administrative cost. This is achieved by paying a ''tax on the tax exemption to all taxpayers'', e.g. in monthly payments. The tax on the tax exemption is computed by applying the nominal flat tax rate to the exemption. The tax on the income is drawn directly ''from the source'', e.g. from an employer. The tax on income is computed by applying the nominal flat tax rate to the income.

This simple method results in an effective progressive rate taxation (although the tax rate for the taxes drawn at the source is flat) which is positive once the income exceeds the tax exemption. If, however, the income is less than the tax exemption, the effective progressive rate actually becomes negative without any involvement by any tax authority. As for the positive progression, only very high incomes would lead to an actual tax rate which is close to the nominal flat tax rate.

The tax on tax exemption also can be understood as a [[tax credit]], which is paid back once an income has reached the level of the tax exemption. This level marks the point where paid taxes and the tax credit are equal. Above that point the state earns taxes from the taxpayer. Below that point the state pays taxes to the taxpayer.

Example:
* The income tax rate is 50%.
* The tax exemption is $30,000.
* The subsidy rate is 50% and equal to the income tax rate.

Under this scheme:
* A person earning $0 would receive $15,000 from the government.
* A person earning $25,000 would receive $2,500 from the government.
* A person earning $30,000 would neither receive any money nor pay any tax.
* A person earning $50,000 would pay a tax of $10,000.
* A person earning $100,000 would pay a tax of $35,000.

Flat tax implementations ''without'' the provision of a negative income tax actually need an ''additional'' effort in order to ''avoid'' negative taxation. For such a tax, the exemption only can be paid after knowing the earned income. Flat tax implementations ''with'' negative income tax allow the payment or crediting of the income tax at any interval, independent of the amount of the actual income.

==Implementation==

While the notion has long been popular in some circles, its implementation has never been politically feasible. This is partly because of the very complex and entrenched nature of most countries' current tax laws: they would have to be rewritten under any NIT system. However, some countries have seen the introduction of refundable (or non-wastable) [[tax credit]]s which can be paid even when there is no tax liability to be offset, such as the [[Earned Income Tax Credit]] in the United States and [[working tax credit]] in the UK. 

In 1971, President [[Richard Nixon]] proposed a negative income tax as the centerpiece of his welfare reform program, but the NIT was not approved by Congress; however, Congress did pass a bill establishing [[Supplemental Security Income]] (SSI), providing a guaranteed income for elderly and disabled persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A policy called negative income tax has been implemented for a certain bracket of low incomes in [[Israel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Experiments==

From 1968 to 1982, the US and Canadian governments conducted a total of five negative income tax experiments. They were the first major social science experiments in the world. The first experiment was the [[New Jersey Income Maintenance Experiment]], proposed by MIT Economics graduate student [[Heather Ross]] in 1967 in a proposal to the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urban.org/pubs/digest/introduction.html |title=An Overview of Social Experimentation and the Digest |publisher=Urban.org |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2013-02-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130101109/http://www.urban.org/pubs/digest/introduction.html |archivedate=2011-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocates==
In the United States, [[Milton_Friedman|Milton]] and [[Rose Friedman]] promoted the idea in 1980 in their book and television series ''[[Free to Choose]]''.
More recently, a negative income tax was advocated by the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] as part of their 2010 platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gp.org/committees/platform/2010/economic-justice.php |title=The Green Party of the United States |publisher=Gp.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111917/http://www.gp.org/committees/platform/2010/economic-justice.php |archivedate=2013-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], a negative income tax is advocated by the [[Pirate Party (Australia)|Pirate Party]] as part of their tax policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pirateparty.org.au/wiki/Platform#Basic_income_through_reverse_taxation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708083444/http://pirateparty.org.au/wiki/Platform#Basic_income_through_reverse_taxation |date=July 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Slovakia]], welfare and tax system reform based on NIT is proposed by [[classical liberal]] [[Freedom and Solidarity]] party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sulik.sk/media/contribution_bonus.pdf] {{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his final book ''[[Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?]]'' (1967), American civil rights leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] wrote&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther King jr., ''[[Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?]]'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shindler|first1=Michael|title=Replace Welfare with a Negative Income Tax|url=http://economics21.org/commentary/replace-welfare-negative-income-tax|website=Economics 21|publisher=The Manhattan Institute|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{"|I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective — the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income.|from the chapter titled "Where We Are Going"}}

==Criticism==
A common criticism is that the NIT might reduce the incentive to work, since recipients of the NIT would receive a guaranteed minimum wage equal to the government payment in the absence of employment. A series of studies in the United States beginning in 1968 attempted to test for effects on work incentives. [[Jodie Allen]] summarizes the key studies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Stanford Research Institute (SRI), which analyzed the SIME/DIME findings, found stronger work disincentive effects, ranging from an average 9 percent work reduction for husbands to an average 18 percent reduction for wives. This was not as scary as some NIT opponents had predicted. But it was large enough to suggest that as much as 50 to 60 percent of the transfers paid to two-parent families under a NIT might go to replace lost earnings. They also found an unexpected result: instead of promoting family stability (the presumed result of extending benefits to two-parent working families on an equal basis), the NITs seemed to increase family breakup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Allen |first1=Jodie T. |editor= [[David R. Henderson]] (ed.) |encyclopedia=[[Concise Encyclopedia of Economics]] |title=Negative Income Tax |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/NegativeIncomeTax.html |year=2002 |edition= 1st |publisher=[[Library of Economics and Liberty]] }} {{OCLC|317650570|50016270|163149563}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The link between NIT and divorce was later determined to be due to a statistical error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | access-date = May 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism comes from the relative expense of the establishment of such a tax. According to a research project conducted by Rutgers University in 2002, a program of targeted job creation would produce similar wealth redistribution with significantly less cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harvey|first=Philip|title=The Relative Cost of a Universal Basic Income and a Negative Income Tax|journal=An International Journal of Basic Income Research|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Israel Fund''' ('''NIF''') is a [[United States|U.S.]]-based non-profit organization established in 1979. It describes its objective as social justice and equality for all Israelis. The New Israel Fund says it has provided $300 million to over 900 Israeli civil society organizations that it describes as "cutting-edge."&lt;ref name="nif-faq"/&gt; It describes itself as active on the issues of civil and human rights, women's rights, religious status, human rights in the occupied territories, the rights of Israel's Arab minority, and freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nif.org/our-issues&lt;/ref&gt; The New Israel Fund is the largest foreign donor to progressive causes in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;"New Israel Fund may drop anti-Zionist donors" Sept 2, 2010 [https://www.thejc.com/news/world/new-israel-fund-may-drop-anti-zionist-donors-1.17782] &lt;/ref&gt;

Its financial support for [[Breaking the Silence (non-governmental organization)|Breaking the Silence]], [[Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel|Adalah]], [[B’Tselem]], [[Yesh Din]],  and other groups allegedly hostile to Zionist values has drawn criticism from many associated with Israel's political right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sokol|first1=Sam|title=Birthright Israel cuts ties with New Israel Fund|date=November 28, 2014|access-date=October 7, 2016|newspaper=[[Jerusalem Post]]|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Birthright-Israel-cuts-ties-with-New-Israel-Fund-383088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology ==
NIF describes itself as "the leading organization committed to democratic change within Israel".&lt;ref name="nif-about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nif.org/about/wearenif |title=We Are NIF |publisher=New Israel Fund |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118084930/http://www.nif.org/about/wearenif |archivedate=18 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its stated objective is "to actualize the vision of Israel's Founders, that of a Jewish and democratic state that, in the words of the Declaration of Independence, 'ensures complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="nif-faq"/&gt; It views Israel as "the sovereign expression of the right of self-determination of the Jewish people and as a democracy dedicated to the full equality of all its citizens and communities".&lt;ref name="nif-principles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nif.org/about/new-israel-fund-principles |title=New Israel Fund Principles |publisher=New Israel Fund |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528072709/http://www.nif.org/about/new-israel-fund-principles |archivedate=28 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It advocates for [[Civil rights|civil]] and human rights, [[Religious toleration|religious tolerance]] and [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]], and closing the [[Social inequality|social]] and [[Economic inequality|economic gaps]] in Israeli society, especially those among Jews and Arabs.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

[[Daniel Sokatch]], CEO, says that in line with their "core values of democracy and equality, we support two states for two peoples and we oppose the occupation and the settlement enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Daniel Sokatch]] |date=16 May 2012 |newspaper=The Australian Jewish News |url=http://www.jewishnews.net.au/nif-in-the-hot-seat/26146 |title=NIF In the Hot Seat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, NIF marched with a "progressive cluster" in the New York Celebrate Israel parade; the cluster included [[Ameinu]], [[Americans for Peace Now]], [[B'Tselem]] USA, [[Partners for Progressive Israel]], and [[Rabbis for Human Rights-North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=17 May 2012 |url=http://www.nif.org/news-media/press-releases/new-israel-fund-with-more-partners-will-march-again-in-new-yorks-annual-celebrate-israel-parade/ |title=New Israel Fund, With More Partners, will March Again in New York's Annual 'Celebrate Israel' Parade |publisher=New Israel Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The New Israel Fund is a registered [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] organization in the United States. The New Israel Fund's headquarters are located in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="nif-faq"/&gt; The New Israel Fund also has offices in [[Jerusalem]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Miami]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], [[Toronto]], [[London]], and [[Basel]].&lt;ref name="nifContact"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nif.org/about/contact/ |title=Contact |publisher=New Israel Fund |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
In October 2009, Daniel Sokatch became the new chief [[executive officer]] of the New Israel Fund, after working as the [[executive director]] of the [[Progressive Jewish Alliance]] and the [[San Francisco]] [[Jewish Federation]].

Rachel Liel, formerly director of Shatil, became Israel [[Executive Director]] on 1 November 2009.

[[Rabbi]] [[Brian Lurie]], former executive director of the San Francisco Federation and [[executive vice president]] of the UJA, was the [[chairman|chair]] of NIF's [[board of directors]], following the term of [[Naomi Chazan]], former deputy speaker of the [[Israeli Knesset]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Chemi Shalev]] |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/new-nif-head-brian-lurie-the-occupation-is-a-cancer-that-is-eating-us.premium-1.455599 |title=New NIF head Brian Lurie: 'The occupation is a cancer that is eating us' |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attorney Talia Sasson, best known for her authorship of the [[Sasson Report|report detailing Israeli government support of illegal settlements]], succeeded Rabbi Lurie as NIF [[President (corporate title)|president]] in June 2015.&lt;ref name=Guttman&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forward.com/articles/205958/new-israel-fund-shifts-cash-in-push-for-progressiv |title=New Israel Fund Shifts Cash in Push for Progressive Politics |first=Nathan |last=Guttman |date=18 September 2014 |work=[[The Forward]] |accessdate=29 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The board consists of 21 community leaders, activists, academics and philanthropists from the United States, Israel, Canada and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Board of Directors"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nif.org/about/people/ |title=People |publisher=New Israel Fund |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other board members include law professor [[Peter Edelman]], economist [[Franklin Fisher]], and Bedouin scholar [[Amal ElSana Alhjooj]].&lt;ref name="Board of Directors"/&gt; International Council members include Israeli novelist [[Amos Oz]], Nobel Prize winner [[Aaron Ciechanover]], former Deputy Attorney General Judith Karp, former Knesset Speaker [[Avram Burg]], and [[Michael Walzer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nif.org/about/people/international-council-members/ |title=International Council Members |publisher=New Israel Fund |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

===Grantmaking===
In 2014, NIF contributed about US$24 million to groups in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nif.org/about/financials/ |title=2014 Annual Report |publisher=New Israel Fund |accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, NIF published guidelines defining who is eligible to receive its grants on its website for the first time.&lt;ref name="jp2010-09-20"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=188620 |title=NIF denies plans to change funding policies |last=Shefler |first=Gil |date=20 September 2010 |work=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nif-guidelines"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nif.org/about/funding-guidelines/ |title=Funding Guidelines |date=September 2010 |publisher=New Israel Fund |accessdate=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naomi Paiss, NIF's vice president of public affairs, says that it is the actions of grantee organizations that are looked at to determine whether they qualify for funding, and not the personal views of individuals involved. In her words, NIF "won't support organizations working to deny the Jewish people's right to sovereign self-determination". She explains that it is not relevant whether the "leaders of (Israeli-)Arab organizations prefer a multinational, multicultural state" so long as the work by the grantees is not "designed to change the State of Israel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=14 February 2014 |author=Yonah Jeremy Bob |title=A big and sometimes tumultuous tent |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |url=http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/A-big-and-sometimes-tumultuous-tent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== NGOs ====

In 2014 NIF had a budget of $31,057,80, and awarded $14.7 million in grants to grantees including [[Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel|Adalah]], [[B'Tselem]], [[Breaking the Silence (non-governmental organization)|Breaking the Silence]], [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel]], the Council for Peace and Security, [[Molad: The Center for the Renewal of Israeli Democracy]], [[Mossawa Center]] and [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]]; in addition, NIF directs "donor advised" grants in which supporters make gifts directly to NGOs on advice from NIF grant experts.&lt;ref name=Grants2014&gt;{{cite news|title=NIF Grants – 2014|url=http://ngo-monitor.org/article/changes_in_nif_grants_few_changes_in_demonization_funding |publisher=[[NGO Monitor]] |date=20 August 2015 |accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2014 Grantees |publisher=New Israel Fund |url=http://www.nif.org/what-we-do/grantmaking/grantees/2014-grantees/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel-US Civil Liberties Law Program===
The New Israel Fund has trained more than 46 Israeli lawyers over the course of 20 years in human rights law. The lawyers are provided with the opportunity to get a [[LLM]] degree at the [[American University]] [[Washington College of Law]] specializing in human rights law. Graduates of the program have successfully argued cases in Israel around social justice, for environmental protections, to curb police brutality, and against discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Quiet Revolution |author=Yuval Yoaz |date=25 May 2004 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/the-quiet-revolution-1.123451 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Initiatives For Democracy===
In September 2014, the New Israel Fund announced a new initiative, New Initiatives for Democracy (NIF-D), that will provide for the seed-funding, partnering and incubation of new programs to construct the missing architecture for the progressive movement in Israel, as well as building bridges to non-progressive constituencies who share values and interests. Initial funding stood at more than $2 million in 2014, granted or seed-funded to eight new initiatives, from think tanks to media monitoring to online engagement and leadership training.&lt;ref name=Guttman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nif.org/what-we-do/new-initiatives-for-democracy |title=New Initiatives for Democracy |publisher=New Israel Fund |accessdate=29 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It's a tactic of intimidation.] 20 Aug, 2017, Renen Netzer, Globes&lt;/ref&gt;  and is credited with seed-funding "almost every significant cause-related progressive NGO in Israel".&lt;ref name="nif-faq"/&gt; Since its inception the fund has provided over US $250 million to more than 900 organizations.&lt;ref name="nif-faq"/&gt; NIF states that while its position is that "Israel is and must be a Jewish and democratic state" it says it was "among the first organizations to see that civil, human and economic rights for Israeli Arabs is an issue crucial to the long-term survival of the state".&lt;ref name="nif-pi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nif.org/issue-areas/israeli-arabs |title=The Paradox of Ethnicity and Citizenship |publisher=New Israel Fund |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101194826/http://nif.org/issue-areas/israeli-arabs |archivedate=1 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender segregation and women's rights===
In 1994, a pair of NIF grantees successfully petitioned the Israeli High Court of Justice to force the Israeli military to stop discriminating on the basis of gender when it came to allowing women to qualify for flight training. The decision, known as the [[Alice Miller (pilot)|Alice Miller]] case, opened the door for women to serve in many combat roles within the Israeli army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alice Miller Chosen to Light Independence Day Torch |date=23 April 2015 |publisher=New Israel Fund |url=http://www.nif.org/stories/our-issues/social-and-economic-justice/alice-miller-chosen-to-light-independence-day-torch/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bettylu K.

In January 2011, the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] ruled that publicly-funded buses cannot enforce a policy of gender segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/israeli-freedom-riders-ensure-womens-place-at-front-of-the-bus/2011/07/14/gIQAYSakGI_story.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Jenna | last=Johnson | date=15 July 2011 | title=Israeli 'Freedom Riders' ensure women's place at front of the bus}}&lt;/ref&gt; IRAC, a grantee of NIF,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://issuu.com/newisraelfund/docs/2010_annual_report/1 |title=2010 Annual Report |date=7 September 2011 |publisher=New Israel Fund |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; initiated the legal efforts to integrate the bus lines. NIF-backed efforts against gender segregation in public spaces included a Chanukah candle-lighting to protest gender segregation at the Western Wall plaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nif.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=524 |title=Chanukah Candle-Lighting at Western Wall Protests Gender-Segregation |publisher=New Israel Fund |accessdate=19 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407214618/http://www.nif.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=524 |archivedate=7 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2011, in response the disappearance of the images of women from advertisements in Jerusalem because of Haredi pressure, NIF launched the "Women Should be Seen and Heard" campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/world/middleeast/israel-faces-crisis-over-role-of-ultra-orthodox-in-society.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Ethan | last1=Bronner |authorlink=Ethan Bronner | first2=Isabel | last2=Kershner |author2link=Isabel Kershner | title=Israel Faces Crisis Over Role of Ultra-Orthodox in Society | date=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In winter 2012, NIF convened "30 social justice organizations" who put pressure on organizers of a fertility and gynecology conference from which women were banned from speaking, and that "nine out of ten Israeli doctors scheduled to speak had withdrawn".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.forward.com/sisterhood-blog/149359/women-only-fertility-conference-is-no-answer/ |title=Women-Only Fertility Conference Is No Answer |last1=Sztokman |first1=Elana |date=10 January 2012 |newspaper=[[The Forward]] |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NIF also supports [[Women of the Wall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jodi Rudoren |date=11 March 2013 |title=Standoff at Western Wall Over Praying by Women |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/world/middleeast/3-ultra-orthodox-men-arrested-in-western-wall-standoff.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which fights for egalitarian prayer at the [[Western Wall]], Judaism's holiest site.

===Social justice protests===
In the summer of 2011, as hundreds of thousands of Israelis protested  for social justice, NIF reportedly raised $35,000 on behalf of the demonstrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/141891/ |title=New Israel Fund Alone in Funding Israel Protests |last=Guttman |first=Nathan |date=26 August 2011 |newspaper=[[The Forward]] |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NIF praised the [[2011 Israeli social justice protests|social justice protest]] as an autonomous, grassroots movement. It said its own participation was limited in scope, which included providing tens of thousands of dollars in small grants to activist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Israel Fund Alone in Funding Israel Protests |first=Nathan |last=Guttman |url=http://forward.com/articles/141891/new-israel-fund-alone-in-funding-israel-protests/ |newspaper=[[The Forward]] |date=2 September 2011 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also acknowledged other activities, including "mapping the initiatives, which were initiated by Shatil and the New Israel Fund" and in terms of providing advice to the protesters and providing funding for the tent cities in the periphery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Israel Fund Comes Clean on Role in Tent Protests |url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/new-israel-fund-comes-clean-on-role-in-tent-protests/2012/01/17/ |newspaper=[[The Jewish Press]] |date=17 January 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nif.org/component/content/article/13-stories/1176-a-letter-from-shatil-director-ronit-heyd |title=A Letter from SHATIL Director Ronit Heyd |publisher=New Israel Fund |accessdate=23 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127120040/http://nif.org/component/content/article/13-stories/1176-a-letter-from-shatil-director-ronit-heyd |archivedate=27 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NIF also organized a petition signed by nearly 4,000 people in support of the protesters. The petition was published in the Israeli edition of the ''International Herald Tribune''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nif.org/issue-areas/component/content/article/12-general/1184-full-page-nif-ad-in-iht-israel-edition |title=Full-Page NIF Ad in IHT Israel Edition |publisher=New Israel Fund |accessdate=23 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503133338/http://www.nif.org/issue-areas/component/content/article/12-general/1184-full-page-nif-ad-in-iht-israel-edition |archivedate=3 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wikileaks===
A leaked U.S. government cable revealed that a former NIF staff person hypothesized that in 100 years Israel would be majority Arab and said that this change would not be the tragedy that Israelis fear since it would become more democratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Noah Pollak]] |date=6 September 2011 |title=Wikileaks Bombshell: New Israel Fund Official Endorses End of Jewish State |work=[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]] |url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/2011/09/06/wikileaks-new-israel-fund-endorses-end-of-jewish-state/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Israel Fund said that this individual left the organization because her personal views diverged from the organization's perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=NIF Statement: Wikileaks and Anti-Democratic Legislation |date=6 September 2011 |publisher=New Israel Fund |url=http://www.nif.org/news-media/press-releases/nif-statement-wikileaks-and-anti-democratic-legislation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BDS===
NIF is opposed to the global [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] (BDS) campaign.&lt;ref name="paiss"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Naomi Paiss |date=16 March 2012 |publisher=[[The Daily Beast]] |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/03/16/a-leftist-s-critique-of-bds.html |title=A Leftist Critique of BDS}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has stated that it does not support global BDS and will not support organizations with BDS programs but that its policy allows NIF the discretion to "engage in dialogue with an important organization that signs one letter supporting divestment rather than summarily dismissing them".&lt;ref name="goldberg"&gt;{{cite news |title=The New Israel Fund, Dipping Its Toe Into the BDS Swamp |first=Jeffrey |last=Goldberg |authorlink=Jeffrey Goldberg |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2010/11/the-new-israel-fund-dipping-its-toe-into-the-bds-swamp/66699/ |work=The Atlantic |date=17 November 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naomi Paiss, Director of Communications, described the campaign as "a tactic that embodies the message that Israel cannot and will not change itself, and for that reason, we think it is inflammatory and counter-productive".&lt;ref name="paiss"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://zeek.forward.com/articles/117036/ |title=Don't Divest; Invest |last=Paiss |first=Naomi |date=28 October 2010 |work=ZEEK |accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the NIF states that it will "not exclude support for organizations that lawfully discourage the purchase of goods or use of services from settlements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is NIF’s position on boycott, divestment and sanctions?|url=https://www.nif.org/about/selected-policies/|website=New Israel Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torture ban===
In 1999, the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] ruled that the Israel Security Agency, also known as [[Shin Bet]], could no longer use various means of physical torture in its interrogations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=7 September 1999 |author=Rebecca Trounson |title=Israeli Court Bans Torture in Interrogations |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/sep/07/news/mn-7626}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matter was brought to the court by three NIF grantees: [[Public Committee Against Torture in Israel]], [[HaMoked]], and [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HCJ 5100/94 - Public Committee Against Torture in Israel et al. v. The State of Israel et al. Judgment |date=6 September 1999 |publisher=Hamoked |url=http://www.hamoked.org/Document.aspx?dID=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision by Chief Justice Aharon Barak concluded "A democratic, freedom loving society does not accept that investigators use any means for the purpose of uncovering the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Judgment |date=6 September 1999 |publisher=Supreme Court of Israel |url=http://www.hamoked.org/files/2012/260_eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eitan Felner, executive director of [[B'Tselem]] said that "The importance of this decision is that it says that certain ends, even crucial ones like fighting random violence against civilians, can't justify every means."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Ilene Prusher]] |date=6 September 1999 |title=Israeli court outlaws torture |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/sep/07/israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some of the groups who brought the case to the court say that some forms of torture continue to be practiced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=6 January 2014 |author=Yonah Jeremy Bob |title=Israeli rights group accuses Shin Bet of using torture despite High Court ban |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |url=http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Israeli-NGO-accuses-Shin-Bet-of-using-torture-despite-High-Court-ban-337196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Josh Nathan-Kazis |author2=Nathan Guttman |date=20 January 2015 |title=Two Countries, Two Paths on Torture |newspaper=[[The Forward]] |url=http://forward.com/news/israel/212351/two-countries-two-paths-on-torture/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ford Foundation funding===
In 2003 and 2008, the [[Ford Foundation]] provided five-year grants worth $20 million each to NGOs in Israel through the New Israel Fund. The foundation was the focus of criticism because most of its donees are liberal. The foundation adopted new, stricter funding guidelines after the [[World Conference against Racism 2001|World Conference against Racism]] in Durban in 2001. At the beginning of the second five-year grant, the Ford Foundation said it would not renew its grants to Israeli NGOs, which had provided roughly one-third of the New Israel Fund's donor-advised giving, citing its policy of creating sustainable funding, which is also being applied to much of its NGO funding worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://forward.com/articles/136816/ |title=Ford Foundation, Big Funder of Israeli NGOs, Pulling Out |last=Guttman |first=Nathan |date=6 April 2011 |work=[[The Forward]] |accessdate=9 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birthright===
In November 2014 [[Birthright Israel]] cancelled a planned trip the two groups had been collaborating on. According to Stephanie Ives, the NIF's New York director, Birthright had provided three reasons: Birthright said the NIF had violated its marketing guidelines, Birthright said it does not work with organizations that seek to influence Israeli policy, and Birthright was cancelling several trips from the New York area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sam Sokol |date=28 November 2014 |title=Birthright Israel cuts ties with New Israel Fund |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Birthright-Israel-cuts-ties-with-New-Israel-Fund-383088}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Birthright Israel Terminates Partnership With Controversial New Israel Fund |date=26 November 2014 |newspaper=[[Algemeiner Journal]] |url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2014/11/26/birthright-israel-terminates-partnership-with-controversial-new-israel-fund/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism ==

=== Pamela Geller ===

[[Pamela Geller]] has put pressure on some of the New Israel Fund's donors to stop funding the group because she says the organization is anti-Israel. Geller says the New Israel Fund "are leftists aligned with the jihad force" and that they are "21st century kapos, but worse". She announced a national advertising effort to place the names of donors in ads on transit systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Moving on From Attacking Islam, Pamela Geller Sponsors N.Y.C. Bus Ads Against New Israel Fund Donors |author=Debra Nussbaum Cohen |date=11 March 2015 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.646449}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anatomy of a Smear |author=[[Jane Eisner]] |date=10 March 2015 |newspaper=[[The Forward]] |url=http://forward.com/opinion/editorial/216301/anatomy-of-a-smear/}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts were criticized by [[Deborah Lipstadt]] and Rabbi [[David Ellenson]], who wrote in ''[[The Forward]]'' that the campaign amounts to [[McCarthyism]]. They also wrote, "it is simply wrong to question the commitment and loyalty of this organization and its supporters to the Jewish state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=13 March 2015 |author=[[Deborah Lipstadt]] |author2=[[David Ellenson]] |title=Echoes of McCarthyism in Smear Campaign Against New Israel Fund Backers |newspaper=[[The Forward]] |url=http://forward.com/opinion/216599/echoes-of-mccarthyism-in-smear-campaign-against-ne/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Im Tirtzu===

In January 2010, [[Im Tirtzu]] placed newspaper advertisements depicting then-NIF President Naomi Chazan with a horn sprouting from her forehead (as a pun, since both the words "horn" and "fund" use the same Hebrew word "Keren") as part of a campaign accusing NIF of responsibility for the [[Goldstone Report]]. Im Tirtzu alleged that 92% of all Israel-based negative reporting in the Goldstone report came from NIF-supported groups.&lt;ref name="jta1"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.jta.org/2010/02/10/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/breaking-down-the-im-tirtzu-report-on-new-israel-fund |title = Breaking down the Im Tirtzu report on New Israel Fund |last=Kampeas |first= Ron |authorlink=Ron Kampeas |date= 9 February 2010 |publisher = JTA |accessdate =5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Im Tirtzu's campaign drew criticism. [[Abe Foxman]], head of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] said that it was "absurd to blame Goldstone on the NIF."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Knesset Slimers Retreat After Foxman Slams Defamation of New Israel Fund |author=[[J.J. Goldberg]] |date=February 5, 2010 |newspaper=The Forward |url=http://forward.com/opinion/125089/knesset-slimers-retreat-after-foxman-slams-defamat/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gershon Baskin]], writing in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', accused Im Tirtzu of using an "anti-Semitic motif" as part of a "witch-hunt" that "is reminiscent of the darkest days of McCarthyism".&lt;ref name=jp-dark&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Article.aspx?ID=168195|title=A dark day for democracy |last=Baskin |first=Gershon |authorlink=Gershon Baskin |date=9 February 2010 |work=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jp-cufi&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=167666 |title=Christians fume over ad showing Chazan wearing horn|date=3 February 2010|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |accessdate=28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] (JTA) Im Tirtzu's report said 16 NIF affiliated groups comprised 14 percent of all sources for the Goldstone report, while stating in a separate section that these constitute 92 percent of Israel-based negative reporting in the Goldstone report; some reporting had incorrectly confused the two separate figures and accused Im Tirzu as being inaccurate.&lt;ref name="jta1"/&gt;

NIF estimated that 1.3% of the citations in the UN report originated from reports by organizations supported by the New Israel Fund.&lt;ref name="nifAnalysis"&gt;{{cite web |date=11 February 2010 |url=http://www.nif.org/media-center/under-attack/lies-damn-lies-and-the-im.html|title=Lies, Damn Lies, and the Im Tirtzu Report - Analysis of the Im Tirtzu Report on the New Israel Fund |publisher=New Israel Fund |accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chemi Shalev]], writing for ''[[Haaretz]]'', defended the NIF, writing "one cannot really overstate what an utter travesty this fanatic jihad against the NIF was".&lt;ref name=Shalev&gt;{{cite news |title=An evening in New York with the enemies of the state |first=Chemi |last=Shalev |authorlink=Chemi Shalev |url=http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/west-of-eden/an-evening-in-new-york-with-the-enemies-of-the-state-1.394034 |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=6 November 2011 |accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benjamin Netanyahu===
In April 2018 Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] blamed the New Israel Fund for undermining an agreement he said he had reached with the government of Rwanda to have that country accept migrants deported from Israel. The Rwandan government denied that such an agreement ever existed. NIF also denied Netanyahu's allegation, although it was later reported that five NIF grantees sent a letter to Rwandan President Paul Kagame asking him not to accept the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NEW ISRAEL FUND GRANTEES ASKED RWANDAN GOVERNMENT NOT TO ACCEPT MIGRANTS|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/New-Israel-Fund-grantees-asked-Rwandan-government-not-to-accept-migrants-549124|website=Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The organization's CEO said that NIF "did support massive numbers of Israelis standing up for what is right and demanding action from their own government." Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel [[Martin Indyk]] termed Netanyahu's statements as  "Bibiesque/Trump-style deflection" and said that "Israelis are smarter than to believe such hogwash." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.jta.org/2018/04/04/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/why-netanyahu-is-blaming-this-organization-for-israels-migrant-crisis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timesofisrael.com/pm-pins-deportation-failure-on-new-israel-fund-demands-knesset-probe/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Netanyahu-New-Israel-Fund-hostile-to-Israel-killed-Rwanda-migrant-plan-547802&lt;/ref&gt;

(p. 126)|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''obscurantism'' derives from the title of the 16th-century satire ''[[Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum]]'' (1515–19, ''Letters of Obscure Men''), that was based upon the [[intellectualism|intellectual]] dispute between the German humanist [[Johann Reuchlin]] and the monk [[Johannes Pfefferkorn]] of the [[Dominican Order]], about whether or not all [[Judaism|Jewish]] books should be [[Book burning|burned]] as un-Christian heresy. Earlier, in 1509, the monk Pfefferkorn had obtained permission from [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] (1486–1519), to burn all copies of the [[Talmud]] ([[Jewish law]] and [[Jewish ethics]]) known to be in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (AD 926–1806); the ''Letters of Obscure Men'' satirized the Dominican arguments for burning "un-Christian" works.

In the 18th century, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers applied the term ''obscurantist'' to any enemy of intellectual enlightenment and the liberal diffusion of knowledge. In the 19th century, in distinguishing the varieties of obscurantism found in [[metaphysics]] and [[theology]] from the "more subtle" obscurantism of the [[critical philosophy]] of [[Immanuel Kant]], and of modern [[philosophical skepticism]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] said: "The essential element in the black art of obscurantism is not that it wants to darken individual understanding, but that it wants to blacken our picture of the world, and darken our idea of existence."&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, F. (1878) ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' Vol. II, Part 1, 27. Cambridge University Press; 2 edition (November 13, 1996). {{ISBN|978-0-521-56704-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In restricting knowledge to an [[Elite|élite]] ruling class of "the few", obscurantism is fundamentally [[anti-democratic]], because its component [[anti-intellectualism]] and [[elitism]] exclude the people as [[intellect]]ually unworthy of knowing the facts and truth about the [[government]] of their [[City-State]].&lt;ref name=Hersh&gt;[[Seymour Hersh|Seymour M.

In 18th century monarchic France, the [[Marquis de Condorcet]], as a [[political science|political scientist]], documented the [[aristocracy]]'s obscurantism about the social problems that provoked the [[French Revolution]] (1789–99) that deposed them and their [[List of French monarchs|King]], [[Louis XVI of France]].

In the 19th century, the [[mathematics|mathematician]] [[William Kingdon Clifford]], an early proponent of [[Darwinism]], devoted some writings to uprooting obscurantism in England, after hearing clerics—who privately agreed with him about evolution—publicly denounce [[evolution]] as un-[[Christianity|Christian]]. Moreover, in the realm of organized religion, obscurantism is a distinct strain of thought independent of theologic allegiance. The distinction is that fundamentalism presupposes sincere religious belief, whereas obscurantism is based upon minority manipulation of the popular faith as political praxis; cf. [[Censorship]].&lt;ref name = Obs&gt;Syed, I. (2002) [http://www.irfi.org/articles/articles_51_100/obscurantism.htm "Obscurantism"]. From: ''Intellectual Achievements of Muslims''.

=== Leo Strauss ===

==== Political philosophy ====
In the 20th century, the American conservative [[political philosophy|political philosopher]] [[Leo Strauss]], for whom philosophy and politics intertwined, and his [[Neoconservatism|Neo-conservative]] adherents adopted the notion of government by the enlightened few as political strategy. He noted that [[intellectuals]], dating from [[Plato]], confronted the dilemma of either an informed populace "interfering" with government, or if it were possible for [[Value (ethics)|good]] politicians to be truthful and still govern to maintain a stable society—hence the [[Noble Lie]] necessary in securing public acquiescence. In ''The City and Man'' (1964), he discusses the myths in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' that Plato proposes effective governing requires, among them, the belief that the country (land) ruled by the State belongs to it (despite some having been conquered from others), and that citizenship derives from more than the [[accident of birth]] in the City-State. Thus, in the ''New Yorker'' magazine article ''Selective Intelligence'', [[Seymour Hersh]] observes that Strauss endorsed the "[[Noble Lie]]" concept: the myths politicians use in maintaining a cohesive society.&lt;ref name="Hersh"&gt;[[Seymour Hersh|Seymour M. Hersh]], [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/05/12/selective-intelligence "Selective Intelligence"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 12 May 2003, accessed April 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;Brian Doherty, [http://www.reason.com/9707/fe.bailey.shtml "Origin of the Specious: Why Do Neoconservatives Doubt Darwin?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725170209/http://www.reason.com/9707/fe.bailey.shtml|date=2008-07-25}}, ''[[Reason Online]]'' July 1997, accessed 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shadia Drury]] criticized Strauss's acceptance of dissembling and deception of the populace as "the peculiar justice of the wise", whereas Plato proposed the Noble Lie as based upon [[Morality|moral]] good. In criticizing ''Natural Right and History'' (1953), she said that "Strauss thinks that the superiority of the ruling philosophers is an intellectual superiority and not a moral one ... [he] is the only interpreter who gives a sinister reading to Plato, and then celebrates him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/faith-iraqwarphiloshophy/article_1542.jsp|title=Noble lies and perpetual war: Leo Strauss, the neocons, and Iraq|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Esoteric texts ====
Leo Strauss also was criticized for proposing the notion of "esoteric" meanings to ancient texts, obscure knowledge inaccessible to the "ordinary" intellect. In ''Persecution and the Art of Writing'' (1952), he proposes that some philosophers write esoterically to avert persecution by the political or religious authorities, and, per his knowledge of [[Maimonides]], [[Al Farabi]], and [[Plato]], proposed that an esoteric writing style is proper for the philosophic text. Rather than explicitly presenting his thoughts, the philosopher's esoteric writing compels the reader to think independently of the text, and so learn. In the ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phædrus]]'', Socrates notes that writing does not reply to questions, but invites dialogue with the reader, thereby minimizing the problems of grasping the written word. Strauss noted that one of writing's political dangers is students' too-readily accepting dangerous ideas—as in the trial of [[Socrates]], wherein the relationship with [[Alcibiades]] was used to prosecute him.

For Leo Strauss, philosophers' texts offered the reader lucid "exoteric" (salutary) and obscure "esoteric" (true) teachings, which are concealed to the reader of ordinary intellect; emphasizing that writers often left contradictions and other errors to encourage the reader's more scrupulous (re-)reading of the text. In observing and maintaining the "[[exoteric]]&amp;nbsp;– [[esoteric]]" dichotomy, Strauss was accused of obscurantism, and for writing esoterically. 

=== Bill Joy ===
[[File:Bill joy.jpg|thumb|right|125px|[[Bill Joy]]]]
In the ''Wired'' magazine article, "[[Why the Future Doesn't Need Us]]" (April 2000), the computer scientist [[Bill Joy]], then a [[Sun Microsystems]] chief scientist, in the sub-title proposed that: "Our most powerful twenty-first-century technologies—robotics, genetic engineering, and nanotech[nology]—are threatening to make humans an endangered species"; in the body, he posits that:

:"The experiences of the atomic scientists clearly show the need to take personal responsibility, the danger that things will move too fast, and the way in which a process can take on a life of its own. We can, as they did, create insurmountable problems in almost no time flat. We must do more thinking up front if we are not to be similarly surprised and shocked by the consequences of our inventions."&lt;ref&gt;Khushf, George (2004). "The Ethics of Nanotechnology: Vision and Values for a New Generation of Science and Engineering", ''Emerging Technologies and Ethical Issues in Engineering'', National Academy of Engineering, pp. 31–32. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. {{ISBN|0-309-09271-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joy's proposal for limiting the dissemination of "certain" knowledge, in behalf of preserving society, was quickly likened to obscurantism. A year later, the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], in the ''Science and Technology Policy Yearbook 2001'', published the article "A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and-Gloom Technofuturists", wherein the computer scientists [[John Seely Brown]] and Paul Duguid countered his proposal as technological tunnel vision, and the predicted technologically derived problems as infeasible, for disregarding the influence of non-scientists upon such societal problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/ch4.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031231160458/http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/ch4.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-12-31 |title=A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and- Gloom Technofuturists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appeal to emotion ==
[[File:Friedrich Hayek portrait.jpg|thumb|right|175px|&lt;center&gt;The economist [[Friedrich August von Hayek]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
In the essay "Why I Am Not a Conservative" (1960), the economist [[Friedrich von Hayek]] said that political [[conservatism]] is ideologically unrealistic, because of the conservative person’s inability to adapt to changing human realities and refusal to offer a positive political program that benefits everyone in a society. In that context, Hayek used the term ''obscurantism'' differently, to denote and describe the [[denial]] of the empirical truth of scientific theory, because of the disagreeable [[Morality|moral]] consequences that might arise from acceptance of fact.

== Deliberate obscurity ==
The second sense of ''obscurantism'' denotes making knowledge abstruse, that is, difficult to grasp. In the 19th and 20th centuries obscurantism became a [[polemics|polemical]] term for accusing an author of deliberately writing obscurely, in order to hide his or her [[intellectualism|intellectual]] vacuousness. Philosophers who are neither [[empiricism|empiricists]] nor [[positivism|positivists]] often are considered obscurantists when describing the abstract concepts of their disciplines. For philosophic reasons, such authors might modify or reject verifiability, falsifiability, and logical non-contradiction. From that perspective, obscure (clouded, vague, abstruse) writing does not necessarily indicate that the writer has a poor grasp of the subject, because unintelligible writing sometimes is purposeful and philosophically considered.&lt;ref name=Rorty&gt;Rorty, Richard (1989) ''Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, Ch. 6: "From Ironist Theory to Private Allusions: Derrida". {{ISBN|0-521-36781-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|right|120px|&lt;center&gt;[[Aristotle]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== Aristotle ===
In contemporary discussions of [[virtue ethics]], [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (''The Ethics'') stands accused of ethical obscurantism, because of the technical, philosophic language and writing style, and their purpose being the [[education]] of a cultured governing [[elite]].&lt;ref name=b&gt;Lisa van Alstyne, "Aristotle's Alleged Ethical Obscurantism." ''Philosophy,'' Vol. 73, No. 285 (July, 1998), pp. 429–452.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kant ===
[[Immanuel Kant]] employed technical terms that were not commonly understood by the layman. [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] contended that post-Kantian philosophers such as [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] deliberately imitated the abstruse style of writing practiced by Kant.&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, ''Manuscript Remains'', Vol. 4, "Cogitata I," §&amp;nbsp;107.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hegel ===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|thumb|120px|&lt;center&gt;[[G. W. F. Hegel]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]]'s philosophy, and the philosophies of those he influenced, especially [[Karl Marx]], have been accused of obscurantism. [[Analytic philosophy|Analytic]] and [[Logical positivism|positivistic]] philosophers, such as [[A. J. Ayer]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and the [[Critical Rationalism|critical-rationalist]] [[Karl Popper]], accused Hegel and [[Hegelianism]] of being obscure. About Hegel's philosophy, Schopenhauer wrote that it is: "...&amp;nbsp;a colossal piece of mystification, which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage.&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur (1965). ''On the Basis of Morality'', trans. E.F.J. Payne. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, pp.15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, biographer Terry Pinkard notes "Hegel has refused to go away, even in analytic philosophy, itself."&lt;ref&gt;''Hegel: A Biography'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000, xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel was aware of his obscurantism, and perceived it as part of philosophical thinking: to accept and transcend the limitations of quotidian (everyday) thought and its concepts. In the essay "Who Thinks Abstractly?", he said that it is not the philosopher who thinks abstractly, but the layman, who uses concepts as [[:wikt:given|givens]] that are immutable, without context. It is the philosopher who thinks concretely, because he transcends the limits of quotidian [[concept]]s, in order to understand their broader context. This makes philosophical thought and language appear obscure, esoteric, and mysterious to the layman.

=== Marx ===
[[File:Marx4.jpg|thumb|120px|right|&lt;center&gt;[[Karl Marx]] in 1861&lt;/center&gt;]]

In his early works,&lt;ref&gt;See his ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1844), ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' (1845), and ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]'' (1847).&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Marx criticized German and French philosophy, especially [[German Idealism]], for its traditions of German irrationalism and ideologically motivated obscurantism.&lt;ref&gt;See, Dallmayr, Fred R., "The Discourse of Modernity: Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger (and Habermas)", ''PRAXIS International'' (4/1988), pp. 377–404.&lt;/ref&gt; Later thinkers whom he influenced, such as the philosopher [[György Lukács]] and social theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]], followed with similar arguments of their own.&lt;ref&gt;[[György Lukács]]'s ''The Destruction of Reason''; [[Jürgen Habermas]]'s ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity''&lt;/ref&gt; However, philosophers such as Karl Popper and Friedrich Hayek in turn criticized Marx and [[Marxism|Marxist]] philosophy as obscurantist (however, see [[#Appeal to emotion|above]] for Hayek's particular interpretation of the term).&lt;ref&gt;Wright, E. O., Levine, A., &amp; Sober, E. (1992). ''Reconstructing Marxism: essays on explanation and the theory of history''. London: Verso, 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heidegger ===
[[Martin Heidegger]], and those influenced by him, such as [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]], have been labeled obscurantists by critics from analytic philosophy and the [[Critical theory (Frankfurt School)|Frankfurt School of critical theory]]. Of Heidegger, [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote, "his philosophy is extremely obscure. One cannot help suspecting that language is here running riot. An interesting point in his speculations is the insistence that nothingness is something positive. As with much else in Existentialism, this is a psychological observation made to pass for logic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Russell|first = Bertrand|authorlink = Bertrand Russell|title = Wisdom of the West|publisher = Crescent Books|year = 1989|pages = 303|isbn = 978-0-517-69041-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is Russell's complete entry on Heidegger, and it expresses the sentiments of many 20th-century analytic philosophers concerning Heidegger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0801485649|title=Heidegger: An Introduction|first=Richard|last=Polt|date=7 January 1999|publisher=Cornell University Press|accessdate=11 February 2017|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Derrida ===
In their obituaries, "Jacques Derrida, Abstruse Theorist, Dies at 74" (10 October 2004) and "Obituary of Jacques Derrida, French intellectual" (21 October 2004), ''[[The New York Times]]'' newspaper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/10/obituaries/10derrida.html|title=Jacques Derrida, Abstruse Theorist, Dies in Paris at 74|date=10 October 2004|work=The New York Times|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=3308320|title=Jacques Derrida|date=21 October 2004|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017|via=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; described Derrida as a deliberately obscure philosopher.

In ''[[Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity]]'' (1989), [[Richard Rorty]] proposed that in ''The Post Card: From Socrates to Freud and Beyond'' (1978), Jacques Derrida purposefully used undefinable words (e.g. [[Différance]]), and used defined words in contexts so diverse that they render the words unintelligible, hence, the reader is unable to establish a context for his literary self. In that way, the philosopher Derrida escapes metaphysical accounts of his work. Since the work ostensibly contains no metaphysics, Derrida has, consequently, escaped metaphysics.&lt;ref name=Rorty /&gt;

Derrida's philosophic work is especially controversial among American and British academics, as when the [[University of Cambridge]] awarded him an honorary doctorate, despite opposition from among the Cambridge philosophy faculty and analytical philosophers worldwide. In opposing the decision, philosophers including [[Barry Smith (academic and ontologist)|Barry Smith]], [[W. V. O. Quine]], [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]], [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]], [[René Thom]], and twelve others, published a letter of protestation in ''[[The Times]]'' of London, arguing that "his works employ a written style that defies comprehension ... [thus] Academic status based on what seems to us to be little more than semi-intelligible attacks upon the values of reason, truth, and scholarship is not, we submit, sufficient grounds for the awarding of an honorary degree in a distinguished university."&lt;ref&gt;Barry Smith et al., "Open letter against Derrida receiving an honorary doctorate from Cambridge University," ''The Times'' [London], 9 May 1992. [http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/varia/Derrida_Letter.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''New York Review of Books'' article "An Exchange on Deconstruction" (February 1984), [[John Searle]] comments on [[Deconstruction]]: "... anyone who reads deconstructive texts with an open mind is likely to be struck by the same phenomena that initially surprised me: the low level of philosophical argumentation, the deliberate obscurantism of the prose, the wildly exaggerated claims, and the constant striving to give the appearance of profundity, by making claims that seem paradoxical, but under analysis often turn out to be silly or trivial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mackey| first = Louis H.| title = An Exchange on Deconstruction (Reply by John R. Searle)| journal = New York Review of Books| volume = 31| issue = 1| date = February 2, 1984| url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/5964| accessdate = 2007-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lacan ===
[[Jacques Lacan]] was an [[intellectual]] who defended obscurantism to a degree. To his students' complaint about the deliberate obscurity of his lectures, he replied: "The less you understand, the better you listen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=7Xw4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=%22The+less+you+understand,+the+better+you+listen%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20less%20you%20understand%2C%20the%20better%20you%20listen%22&amp;f=false | title = The ego in Freud's theory and in the technique of psychoanalysis, 1954–1955 | isbn = 978-0-521-31801-3 | author1 = Lacan | first1 = Jacques | year = 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1973 seminar ''Encore'', he said that his ''Écrits'' (''Writings'') were not to be understood, but would effect a meaning in the reader, like that induced by mystical texts. The obscurity is not in his writing style, but in the repeated allusions to Hegel, derived from [[Alexandre Kojève]]'s lectures on Hegel, and similar theoretic divergences.

=== Sokal Affair ===

The [[Sokal Affair]] (1996) was a publishing [[hoax]] that the professor of physics [[Alan Sokal]] perpetrated on the editors and readers of ''[[Social Text]]'', an [[academic journal]] of [[postmodernism|post-modern]] [[cultural studies]] that was not then a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] publication. In 1996, as an experiment testing [[publishing|editorial]] integrity (fact-checking, verification, peer review, etc.), Sokal submitted "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity", a [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] article proposing that physical reality is a social construct, in order to learn if ''Social Text'' would "publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if: (a) it sounded good, and, (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions".&lt;ref name = Physicist&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html| title = A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies| accessdate= April 3, 2007| last = Sokal| first = Alan D.| authorlink = Alan Sokal| work = [[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]| date =May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sokal's fake article was published in the Spring/Summer 1996 issue of ''Social Text'', which was dedicated to the [[Science Wars]] about the conceptual validity of [[scientific objectivity]] and the nature of scientific theory, among [[Scientific realism|scientific realists]] and postmodern critics in American universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.physics.nyu.edu/~as2/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html| title = Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity| accessdate= 3 April 2007| last = Sokal| first = Alan D.| authorlink = Alan Sokal| date = Spring–Summer 1996 |origyear=1994 (original version published 1994-11-28, revised 1995-05-13)| work = [[Social Text]]|issue= 46/47| publisher = [[Duke University]] Press| pages = 217–252|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070326153354/http://www.physics.nyu.edu/~as2/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate = 26 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sokal's ''raison de guerre'' ("war reason") for publication of a false article was that postmodernist critics questioned the objectivity of science, by criticising the [[scientific method]] and the nature of knowledge, usually in the disciplines of cultural studies, [[cultural anthropology]], [[feminist studies]], [[comparative literature]], [[media studies]], and [[science and technology studies]]. Whereas the scientific realists countered that objective scientific knowledge exists, riposting that postmodernist critics almost knew nothing of the science they criticized. In the event, editorial deference to "[[Appeal to Authority|Academic Authority]]" (the Author-Professor) prompted the editors of ''Social Text'' not to fact-check Sokal's manuscript by submitting it to peer review by a scientist.

Later, concerning the lack of editorial integrity shown by the publication of his fake article in ''Social Text'' magazine, Sokal addressed the matter in the May 1996 edition of the ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' journal, in the article "A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies", in which he (Sokal) announced that his transformative hermeneutics article was a [[parody]], submitted "to test the prevailing intellectual standards", and concluded that, as an academic publication, ''Social Text'' ignored the requisite [[intellectual rigor]] of verification and "felt comfortable publishing an article on [[quantum physics]] without bothering to consult anyone knowledgeable in the subject".&lt;ref name = Physicist /&gt;&lt;ref name="LinguaFranca"&gt;{{cite news | last = Sokal| first = Alan | title = A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies | pages = 2| newspaper = Lingua Franca| date = May–June 1996| url = http://www.ee.bgu.ac.il/~censor/katz-directory/01-07-17sokal-lingua-franca-experiment.pdf| accessdate =27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, as a [[Intellectual|public intellectual]], Sokal said his hoax was an action protesting against the contemporary tendency towards obscurantism—abstruse, esoteric, and vague writing in the [[social sciences]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In short, my concern over the spread of [[subjectivism|subjectivist]] thinking is both intellectual and political. Intellectually, the problem with such doctrines is that they are false (when not simply meaningless). There is a real world; its properties are not merely social constructions; facts and evidence do matter. What sane person would contend otherwise? And yet, much contemporary academic theorizing consists precisely of attempts to blur these obvious truths—the utter absurdity of it all being concealed through obscure and pretentious language.&lt;ref name = Physicist /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moreover, independent of the hoax, as a pseudoscientific [[Masterpiece|opus]], the article "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity" is described as an exemplar "[[pastiche]] of [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Cant (language)|cant]], fawning references, grandiose quotations, and outright nonsense, centered on the claim that physical reality is merely a social construct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Harrell| first = Evans| title = A Report from the Front of the "Science Wars": The controversy over the book ''Higher Superstition,'' by Gross and Levitt and the recent articles by Sokal| journal = Notices of the American Mathematical Society| volume = 43| issue = 10| pages = 1132–1136| date =October 1996| url = http://www.ams.org/notices/199610/comm-harrell.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8326">The '''overshooting model''', or the '''exchange rate overshooting hypothesis''', first developed by economist [[Rudi Dornbusch]], is a theoretical explanation for high levels of [[exchange rate]] volatility. The key features of the model include the assumptions that goods' prices are sticky, or slow to change, in the short run, but the prices of currencies are flexible, that [[arbitrage]] in asset markets holds, via the [[uncovered interest parity]] equation, and that expectations of exchange rate changes are "consistent": that is, [[rational expectations|rational]]. The most important insight of the model is that adjustment lags in some parts of the economy can induce compensating volatility in others; specifically, when an [[exogenous]] variable changes, the short-term effect on the exchange rate can be greater than the long-run effect, so in the short term, the exchange rate ''overshoots'' its new equilibrium long-term value. 
 
Dornbusch developed this model back when many economists held the view that ideal markets should reach equilibrium and stay there. Volatility in a market, from this perspective, could only be a consequence of imperfect or [[information asymmetry|asymmetric information]] or adjustment obstacles in that market. Rejecting this view, Dornbusch argued that volatility is in fact a far more fundamental property than that.

According to the model, when a change in monetary policy occurs (e.g., an unanticipated permanent increase in the money supply), the market will adjust to a new equilibrium between prices and quantities. Initially, because of the "stickiness" of prices of goods, the new short run equilibrium level will first be achieved through shifts in financial market prices. Then, gradually, as prices of goods "unstick" and shift to the new equilibrium, the [[foreign exchange market]] continuously reprices, approaching its new long-term equilibrium level. Only after this process has run its course will a new long-run equilibrium be attained in the domestic money market, the currency exchange market, and the goods market.

As a result, the foreign exchange market will initially overreact to a monetary change, achieving a new short run equilibrium. Over time, goods prices will eventually respond, allowing the foreign exchange market to dissipate its overreaction, and the economy to reach the new long run equilibrium in all markets.

== Outline of the model ==

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Assumption 1:
| Aggregate demand is determined by the standard open economy [[IS-LM]] mechanism
|}
That is to say, the position of the Investment Saving (IS) curve is determined by the volume of injections into the flow of income and by the competitiveness of Home country output measured by the real exchange rate.

The first assumption is essentially saying that the IS curve (demand for goods) position is in some way dependent on the real [[effective exchange rate]] Q.

That is, [IS = C + I + G +Nx(Q)]. In this case, net exports is dependent on Q (as Q goes up, foreign countries' goods are relatively more expensive, and home countries' goods are cheaper, therefore there are higher net exports).

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Assumption 2:
| Financial Markets are able to adjust to shocks instantaneously, and investors are risk neutral.
|}
If financial markets can adjust instantaneously and investors are risk neutral, it can be said the uncovered [[interest rate parity]] (UIP) holds at all times. That is, the equation r = r*  + Δs&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; holds at all times (explanation of this formula is below).

It is clear, then, that an expected depreciation/appreciation offsets any current difference in the exchange rate. If r &gt; r*, the exchange rate (domestic price of one unit of foreign currency) is expected to increase. That is, the domestic currency depreciates relative to the foreign currency.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Assumption 3:
| In the short run, goods prices are 'sticky'. That is, aggregate supply is horizontal in the short run, though it is positively sloped in the long run.
|}
In the long run, the exchange rate(s) will equal the long run equilibrium exchange rate,(ŝ).

'''Formal Notation'''

[1] r = r* +Δse (uncovered interest rate parity - approximation)

[2] Δs&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; = θ(ŝ – s) (Expectations of market participants)

[3] m - p = ky-lr (Demand/Supply on money)

[4] y&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; = h(s-p) = h(q) (demand for the home country output)

[5] þ = π(yd- ŷ)(proportional change in prices with respect to time) dP/dTime

From the above can be derived the following (using algebraic substitution)

[6] p - p_hat = - lθ(ŝ - s)

[7] þ = π[h(s-p) - ŷ]

'''In equilibrium'''

y&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; = ŷ (demand for output equals the long run demand for output)

from this substitution shows that
[8] ŷ/h = ŝ - p_hat
That is, in the long run, the only variable that affects the real exchange rate is growth in capacity output.

Also, 
Δs&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 (that is, in the long run the expected change of inflection is equal to zero)

Substituting into [2] yields r = r*.
Substituting that into [6] shows:

[9] p_hat = m -kŷ + l r*

taking [8] &amp; [9] together:

[10] ŝ = ŷ(h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; - k) + m +lr*

comparing [9] &amp; [10], it is clear that the only difference between them is the intercept (that is the slope of both is the same). This reveals that given a rise in money stock pushes up the long run values of both in equally proportional measures, the real exchange rate (q) must remain at the same value as it was before the market shock. Therefore, the properties of the model at the beginning are preserved in long run equilibrium, the original equilibrium was stable.

'''Short run disequilibrium'''

The standard approach is to rewrite the basic equations [6] &amp; [7] in terms of the deviation from the long run equilibrium).
In equilibrium [7] implies 0 = π[h(ŝ-p_hat) - ŷ]
Subtracting this from [7] yields

[11] þ = π[h(q-q_hat) 
The rate of exchange is positive whenever the real exchange rate is above its equilibrium level, also it is moving towards the equilibrium level] - This yields the direction and movement of the exchange rate.

In equilibrium, [9] hold, that is [6] - [9] is the difference from equilibrium.
→←←
[12] p - p_hat = -lθ(s-ŝ)
This shows the line upon which the exchange rate must be moving (the line with slope -lθ).

Both [11] &amp; [12] together demonstrates that the exchange rate will be moving towards the long run equilibrium exchange rate, whilst being in a position that implies that it was initially overshot.
From the assumptions above, it is possible to derive the following situation. 
This demonstrated the overshooting and subsequent readjustment. In the graph on the top left, So is the initial long run equilibrium, S1 is the long run equilibrium after the injection of extra money and S2 is where the exchange rate initially jumps to (thus overshooting). When this overshoot takes place, it begins to move back to the new long run equilibrium S1.

'''Pacificism''' is the general term for [[ethical]] opposition to [[violence]] or [[war]], except in cases where force is deemed absolutely necessary to advance the cause of [[peace]].

It falls between [[pacifism]], which usually states that killing, violence or war is unconditionally wrong in all cases, and [[defensivism]], which accepts all ''defensive'' wars and acts of deterrence as morally just.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.westernherald.com/media/storage/paper881/news/2002/10/10/Opinion/Pacifism.Cannot.Hold.Up.Under.Scrutiny-2127363.shtml Western Herald - Pacifism cannot hold up under scrutiny] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629055802/http://media.www.westernherald.com/media/storage/paper881/news/2002/10/10/Opinion/Pacifism.Cannot.Hold.Up.Under.Scrutiny-2127363.shtml |date=2008-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacificism states that war can only ever be considered as a firm "last resort", condemning both [[aggression]] and [[militarism]]. In the 1940s, the two terms were not conceptually distinguished and pacificism was considered merely as an archaic spelling, although less 'barbarous' than the more common and shorter form.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite magazine

The distinct theory was first put forward by [[A. J. P. Taylor]] in ''The Trouble-Makers'' (1957)&lt;ref&gt;‘By ‘pacificism’ I mean the advocacy of a peaceful policy; by ‘pacifism’ (a word invented only in the twentieth century) the doctrine of non-resistance. The latter is the negation of policy, not an alternative, and therefore irrelevant to my theme. Hence my disregard for the Peace Societies.’  AJP Taylor, ''The Trouble-Makers'', London: H Hamilton, 1957, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently defined by Martin Ceadel in his 1987 book, ''Thinking About Peace and War''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/pacifism.htm#SH2c Pacifism - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/peaceed/pe_debate.html Pledge Peace Union - Debating Peace and War]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also discussed in detail in [[Richard Norman]]'s book: ''Ethics, Killing and War''.

The largest national peace association in history, the British [[League of Nations Union]], was pacificist rather than pacifist in orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Birn, ''The League of Nations Union'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the majority of peace activists have been pacificists rather than strict pacifists.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ceadel, ''Semi Detached Idealists: The British Peace Movement and International Relations, 1854-1945'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prajñā''' ([[Sanskrit]]) or '''paññā''' ([[Pāli]]) "wisdom" is insight in the true nature of reality, namely primarily [[anicca]] (impermanence), [[dukkha]] (dissatisfaction or suffering), [[anatta|anattā]] (non-self) and [[śūnyatā]] (emptiness).

==Etymology==
''Prajñā'' is often translated as "wisdom", but is closer in meaning to "insight", "non-discriminating knowledge", or "intuitive apprehension".{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=218}}

* ''jñā'' can be translated as "consciousness", "knowledge", or "understanding".&lt;ref group=web&gt;See, e.g., Monier-Williams (1899), "jña," p. 425 (retrieved 14 August 2012 from "Cologne U." at [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/MWScanpdf/mw0425-jehila.pdf mw0425-jehila.pdf]).&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Pra'' is an intensifier which can be translated as "higher", "greater", "supreme" or "premium",&lt;ref group=web&gt;See, e.g., Monier-Williams (1899), "prā," p. 652 (retrieved 14 Aug. 2012 from "Cologne U." at http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0659-prajalpana.jpg)&lt;/ref&gt; or "being born or springing up",{{sfn|Loy|1997|p=136}} referring to a spontaneous type of knowing.{{sfn|Loy|1997|p=136}}

==Understanding in the Buddhist traditions==
''Paññā'' is the fourth virtue of ten Theravāda ''[[pāramitā|pāramitās]]'', and the sixth of the six Mahāyāna ''pāramitās''.

===Theravada Buddhism===
In the [[Pāli Canon]], ''paññā'' is [[Samādhi|concentrated]] [[vipassana|insight]] into the [[Three marks of existence|three characteristics]] of all things, namely [[anicca|impermanence]], [[dukkha|suffering]] and [[anatta|no-self]], and the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Nirvana and Other Buddhist Felicities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2go_y5KYyoC |year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-57054-1 |pages=140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Gombrich|title=Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZyJAgAAQBAJ|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-90352-8|page=47}}, '''Quote:''' "All phenomenal existence [in Buddhism] is said to have three interlocking characteristics: impermanence, suffering and lack of soul or essence."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Olson|title=The Different Paths of Buddhism: A Narrative-Historical Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QRp-AixBLKUC |year=2005|publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-3778-8 |pages=63–64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 5th-century exegetical work ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'', one of the most revered books in Theravada Buddhism, [[Buddhaghosa|Buddhaghoṣa]] states that the function of ''paññā'' is "to abolish the darkness of [[Avidya (Buddhism)|delusion]]".{{sfn|Buddhaghosa|Ñāṇamoli|1999|p=437}}

===Mahāyāna Buddhism===
{{See also|Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction}}
In Mahayana Buddhism, the importance of prajna was stressed in combination with [[Karuṇā|karuna]], compassion. It took a central place in the ''[[Perfection of Wisdom|Prajñā-pāramitā Sutras]]'', such as the [[Heart Sutra]]. Prajna is spoken of as the principal means of attaining [[Nirvana (concept)|nirvāna]], through its revelation of the true nature of all things as [[Sunyata|emptiness]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3354">The '''principle of plenitude''' asserts that the universe contains all possible forms of existence.  The [[Intellectual history|historian of ideas]] [[Arthur Oncken Lovejoy|Arthur Lovejoy]] was the first to trace the history of this [[philosophy|philosophically]] important principle explicitly.  Lovejoy distinguishes two versions of the principle: a static version, in which the universe displays a constant fullness and diversity, and a temporalized version, in which fullness and diversity gradually increase over time.

Lovejoy traces the principle of plenitude to the writings of [[Plato]], finding in the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' an insistence on "the necessarily complete translation of all the ideal possibilities into actuality".&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy 1936, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  By contrast, he takes [[Aristotle]] to reject the principle in his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', when he writes that "it is not necessary that everything that is possible should exist in actuality".&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy 1936, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Plato, the principle of plenitude has had the following adherents:

*[[Epicurus]] reiterated the principle in fr.266 [[Hermann Usener|Us.]] His follower [[Lucretius]] (''DRN'' V 526-33 ) famously applied the principle to the sets of multiple explanations by which the Epicureans account for astronomical and meteorological phenomena: every possible explanation is also true, if not in our world, then elsewhere in the infinite universe.
*[[Augustine of Hippo]] brought the principle from [[Neo-Platonic]] thought into early Christian [[Theology]].
*[[St Anselm]]'s [[ontological argument]]s for God's existence used the principle's implication that nature will become as complete as it possibly can be, to argue that existence is a "perfection" in the sense of a completeness or fullness.

In [[set theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''reflection principle''' says that it is possible to find sets that resemble the class of all sets. There are several different forms of the reflection principle depending on exactly what is meant by "resemble". Weak forms of the reflection principle are theorems of [[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory|ZF set theory]] due to {{harvtxt|Montague|1961}}, while stronger forms can be new and very powerful axioms for set theory. 

The name "reflection principle" comes from the fact that properties of the universe of all sets are "reflected" down to a smaller set.

==Motivation==

A naive version of the reflection principle states that "for any property of the universe of all sets we can find a set with the same property". This leads to an immediate contradiction: 
the universe of all sets contains all sets, but there is no set with the property that it contains all sets. To get useful (and non-contradictory) reflection principles we need to be more careful about what we mean by "property" and what properties we allow. 

To find non-contradictory reflection principles we might argue informally as follows. Suppose that we have some collection ''A'' of methods for forming sets (for example, taking powersets, subsets, the axiom of replacement, and so on). We can imagine taking all sets obtained by repeatedly applying all these methods, and form these sets into a class ''V'', which can be thought of as a model of some set theory. But now we can introduce the following new principle for forming sets: "the collection of all sets obtained from some set by repeatedly applying all methods in the collection ''A'' is also a set". If we allow this new principle for forming sets, we can now continue past ''V'', and consider the class ''W'' of all sets formed using the principles ''A'' and the new principle. In this class ''W'', ''V'' is just a set, closed under
all the set-forming operations of ''A''. In other words the universe ''W'' contains a ''set'' ''V'' which resembles ''W'' in that it is closed under all the methods ''A''.

We can use this informal argument in two ways. We can try to formalize it in (say) ZF set theory; by doing this we obtain some theorems of ZF set theory, called reflection theorems. 
Alternatively we can use this argument to motivate introducing new axioms for set theory.

==In ZFC==

In trying to formalize the argument for the reflection principle of the previous section in ZF set theory, it turns out to be necessary to add some conditions about the collection of properties ''A'' (for example, ''A'' might be finite). Doing this produces 
several closely related "reflection theorems" of ZFC all of which state that we can find a set that is almost a model of ZFC. 

One form of the reflection principle in ZFC says that for any '''finite''' set of axioms of ZFC we can find a countable [[set model|transitive model]] satisfying these axioms. (In particular this proves that, unless inconsistent, ZFC is not finitely axiomatizable because if it were it would prove the existence of a model of itself, and hence prove its own consistency, contradicting Gödel's second incompleteness theorem.) This version of the reflection theorem is closely related to the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]]. 

Another version of the reflection principle says that for any '''finite''' number of formulas of ZFC we can find a set ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; in the [[cumulative hierarchy]] such that all the formulas in the set are [[absoluteness (mathematical logic)|absolute]] for ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; (which means very roughly that they hold in ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if they hold in the universe of all sets). So this says that the set ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; resembles the universe of all sets, at least as far as the given finite number of formulas is concerned. In particular for any formula of ZFC there is a theorem of ZFC that the formula is logically equivalent to a version of it with all quantifiers relativized to ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; See {{harv|Jech|2002|p=168}}.

If &amp;kappa; is a strong inaccessible, then there is a closed unbounded subset ''C'' of &amp;kappa;, such that for every α∈''C'', the identity function from V&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; to V&lt;sub&gt;&amp;kappa;&lt;/sub&gt; is an elementary embedding.

==As new axioms==

Bernays used a reflection principle as an axiom for one version of set theory (not [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], which is a weaker theory). His reflection principle stated roughly that if ''A'' is a class with some property, then one can find a transitive set ''u'' such that ''A∩u'' has the same property when considered as a subset of the "universe" ''u''. This is quite a powerful axiom and implies the existence of several of the smaller [[large cardinal]]s, such as [[inaccessible cardinal]]s. (Roughly speaking, the class of all ordinals in ZFC is an inaccessible cardinal apart from the fact that it is not a set, and the reflection principle can then be used to show that there is a set which has the same property, in other words which is an inaccessible cardinal.) Unfortunately, this cannot be axiomatized directly in ZFC, and a class theory like [[Morse–Kelley set theory|MK]] normally has to be used. The consistency of Bernays's reflection principle is implied by the existence of a [[Erdős cardinal|ω-Erdős cardinal]]. 

There are many more powerful reflection principles, which are closely related to the various large cardinal axioms. For almost every known large cardinal axiom there is a known reflection principle that implies it, and conversely all but the most powerful known reflection principles are implied by known large cardinal axioms {{harv|Marshall R.|1989}}. An example of this is the [[wholeness axiom]], which implies the existence of [[huge cardinal|super-n-huge cardinal]]s for all finite n and its consistency is implied by an I3 [[rank-into-rank|rank-into-rank cardinal]].

'''Robert Henry Lawrence Phillipson''' (born 18 March 1942 in [[Gourock]], [[Scotland]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albumacademicum.uva.nl/ R.H.L. Phillipson, 1942 -] at the University of Amsterdam ''Album Academicum'' website.&lt;/ref&gt; is Research Professor at [[Copenhagen Business School]]'s Department of English. He is perhaps best known for writing ''[[Linguistic Imperialism]]'' and ''[[English-Only Europe?]]: Challenging Language Policy'' (translated in [[Esperanto]] by István Ertl: ''Ĉu nur-angla Eŭropo? Defio al lingva politiko''). He graduated as an undergraduate from Cambridge University

He got his PhD from the [[University of Amsterdam]] and his interests include [[language pedagogy]], [[language policy]], and [[linguistic human rights]].

On 21 February 2010, Phillipson was awarded the [[Linguapax Prize]] along with [[Miquel Siguan i Soler]]. [[Linguapax Institute]] describes them as "renowned advocates of multilingual education as a factor of peace and of linguistic rights against cultural and linguistic homogenization processes". &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linguapax.org/en/news/2010/02/21/miquel-siguan-and-robert-phillipson-linguapax-award-2010-ex-aequo "Linguapax Award 2010"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613050334/http://www.linguapax.org/en/news/2010/02/21/miquel-siguan-and-robert-phillipson-linguapax-award-2010-ex-aequo |date=13 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MontrealSoupKitchen1931.jpg|thumb|A soup kitchen in [[Montreal, Quebec]], [[Canada]] in 1931.]]
A '''soup kitchen''', '''meal center,''' or '''food kitchen''' is a place where [[food]] is offered to the hungry usually for free or sometimes at a below market [[price]]. Frequently located in lower-income neighborhoods, soup kitchens are often staffed by [[Volunteering|volunteer]] organizations, such as [[Church body|church]] or community groups. Soup kitchens sometimes obtain food from a [[food bank]] for free or at a low price, because they are considered a [[Charitable organization|charity]], which makes it easier for them to feed the many people who require their services.

Many historical and some modern soup kitchens serve only [[soup]] (hence its name) with perhaps some bread. But several establishments which title themselves as a "soup kitchen" also serve other types of food, so social scientists sometimes discuss them together with similar hunger relief agencies that provide more varied hot meals, like food kitchens and meal centers.

While societies have been using various methods to share food with the hungry for millennia, the first soup kitchens in the modern sense may have emerged in the late 18th century. By the late 19th century, they were to be found in several American and European cities. In the [[United States]] and elsewhere, they became more prominent in the 20th century during the [[Great Depression]]. With the improved economic conditions that followed [[World War II]], soup kitchens became less widely used, at least in the advanced economies. In the United States there was a resurgence in the use of soup kitchens following the cutbacks in welfare that were implemented in the early 1980s.

In the 21st century, the use of soup kitchens expanded in both the United States and Europe, following [[2007–08 world food price crisis|lasting global increases in the price of food]] which began in late 2006. Demand for their services grew as the [[Great Recession]] began to worsen economic conditions for those on low income. In much of Europe, demand further increased after the introduction of [[austerity]]-based economic policies from 2010.

==History==
The earliest occurrences of soup kitchens are difficult to identify. Throughout history, societies have invariably recognized a [[moral obligation]] to feed the hungry. The philosopher [[Simone Weil]] wrote that feeding the hungry when one has resources to do so is the most obvious obligation of all. She also said that as far back as [[Ancient Egypt]], it was believed that people needed to show they had helped the hungry in order to justify themselves in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Simone Weil]]|title=[[The Need for Roots]]|page=6|year=2002 |orig-year=1942|isbn=0-415-27102-9|publisher=[[Routledge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soup has long been one of the most economical and simple ways to supply nutritious food to large numbers of people.&lt;ref name ="allAboutSoup"&gt;

Social historian [[Karl Polanyi]] wrote that before markets became the world's dominant form of economic organisation in the 19th century, most human societies would generally either starve all together or not at all; because, communities would naturally share their food. As markets began to replace the older forms of resource allocation such as [[Redistribution (cultural anthropology)|Redistribution]], [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|Reciprocity]], and [[Autarky]], society's overall level of food security would typically rise. But food insecurity could become worse for the poorest section of society, and the need arose for more formal methods for providing them with food.&lt;ref name ="GreatTransformation"&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Karl Polanyi]]|title=[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]]|year=2002 |orig-year=1942|chapter=chpt. 1-5|ISBN=978-0-8070-5643-1|publisher=Beacon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian churches traditionally provided food for the hungry since [[Late antiquity]], with the nourishment mainly provided in the form of [[soup]].

===Emergence of the modern soup kitchen===
[[Image:Count Rumford.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Sir Benjamin Thompson, painted by [[Thomas Gainsborough]], 1783.]]
The earliest modern soup kitchens were established by the inventor [[Benjamin Thompson|Sir Benjamin Thompson]], who was employed as an [[aide-de-camp]] to the [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria]] in the 1790s. Thompson was an American loyalist refugee from New England, and an inventor who was ennobled by Bavaria as Count Rumford. The Count was a prominent advocate of hunger relief, writing pamphlets that were widely read across Europe.

His message was especially well received in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], where he had previously held a senior government position for several years and was known as "the Colonel". An urgent need had recently arisen in Britain for food relief, due to its leading role in driving the [[Industrial Revolution]]. While technological development and economic reforms were rapidly increasingly overall prosperity, conditions for the poorest were often made worse, as traditional ways of life were disrupted. In the closing years of the 18th century, soup kitchens run on the principles pioneered by Rumford were to be found throughout [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Scotland]], with about 60,000 people being fed by them daily in [[London]] alone.&lt;ref name="allAboutSoup"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CountRumford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/food/2010/12/count-rumford-and-the-history-of-the-soup-kitchen/|title=Count Rumford and the History of the Soup Kitchen|publisher=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|author=Lisa Bramen|date=29 December 2010|accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Shadow Behind Our Founding Fathers: A traitor, a scientist, a womanizer and an enigma" review of Nicholas Delbanco's ''The Count of Concord'' '''Book World''' p. 9, 22 June 2008, ''The Washington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt;

While soup kitchens were generally well regarded, they did attract criticism from some, for encouraging dependency, and sometimes on a local level for attracting vagrants to an area. In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] they were made illegal, along with other forms of aid apart from workhouses, by the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|Poor Law Amendment Act]] of 1834.{{efn|Note that criticism of soup kitchens was only a minor driver of the 1834 law - the move was driven more by free market ideology and discontent with other forms of "outdoor" aid like the much more widely disliked Speemhanland system, see [[Hunger in the United Kingdom]].}}

During the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish famine]] of the 19th century, in which as many as one million people may have died, the [[British government]] passed the [[Temporary Relief Act]] (also known as the Soup Kitchen Act) in February 1847. The Act amended the restrictions on the provision of aid outside the workhouses for the duration of the famine, and expressly allowed the establishment of soup kitchens in Ireland to relieve pressure from the overstretched [[Irish Poor Laws|Poor Law]] system, which was proving to be totally inadequate in coping with the disaster.&lt;ref name = "Poverty"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gwendolyn Mink and Alice O'Connor|title=Poverty in the United States|pages=321–323|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-597-4|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell Bartoletti|first=Susan|title=Black potatoes: the story of the great Irish famine, 1845-1850|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2001|pages=75|isbn=978-0-618-00271-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WdmQoaeVuG4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA75&amp;lpg=RA1-PA75&amp;dq=%22Soup+Kitchen+Act%22+1847&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8KuSXfbTHx&amp;sig=KPV_4StEhWpvltXv5_7s161nGbQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OlBrSqmjDJmOjAfihr2eCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prohibition against soup kitchens was soon relaxed on mainland Britain too, though they never again became as prevalent as they had been in the early 19th century, partly as from the 1850s onwards, economic conditions generally began to improve even for the poorest. For the first few decades after the return of soup kitchens to mainland [[Great Britain|Britain]], they were at first heavily regulated, run by groups like the [[Charity Organization Society]]. Even in the early 20th century, campaigning journalists like [[Bart Kennedy]] would criticize them for their long queues, and for the degrading questions staff would ask the hungry before giving out any soup.&lt;ref name ="allAboutSoup"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="GreatTransformation"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "HungerModHist"/&gt;

===Spread to the United States===

The concept of soup kitchens spread to the [[United States]] from Ireland after the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great famine]] and the concomitant wave of Irish emigration to the [[New World]].&lt;ref name = "Poverty" /&gt; The earliest ones were established in the 1870s. A sharp rise in the number of hungry people resulting from an industrial recession coincided with the success of the  [[Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor|AICP,]] and the American branch of the ''Charity Organization Society'' in getting various forms of "outdoor relief"{{efn|In the main, this meant ending the practice where municipal officials would give out small sums of cash to the poor. Unlike in Britain a few decades earlier, the US did not pass nationwide laws restricting private individuals from giving food to the hungry.}} banned. This resulted in civil society establishing soup kitchens, to help feed those of the poor who did not wish to subject themselves to the regimented organisation of the [[Almshouses]] favored by the charitable societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Todd DePastino]]|title=Citizen Hobo: How a Century of Homelessness Shaped America|page=22|year=2005|isbn=0226143791|publisher=[[Chicago University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed the term “breadline” entered the popular lexicon in the 1880s. It was during those years that a noteworthy bakery in New York City’s Greenwich Village, “Fleischmann Model Viennese Bakery,” instituted a policy of distributing unsold baked goods to the poor at the end of their business day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wetsteon |first=Ross |title=Republic of Dreams: Greenwich Village, the American Bohemia, 1910–1960 |location= |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |year=2003 |at=preface |isbn=0-684-86996-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
By the late 19th century  soup kitchens were to be found in several US cities.&lt;ref name="CountRumford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HungerModHist"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Vernon|title=Hunger: A Modern History|chapter=Chpts. 1-3|year=2007|isbn=0674026780|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of soup kitchens hit the mainstream of [[United States]] consciousness during the [[Great Depression]]. One soup kitchen in [[Chicago]] was even sponsored by [[United States|American]] mobster [[Al Capone]] in an effort to clean up his image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/history/acoffee.html "Soup Kitchens"] ''Social Security Online History Page''.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the improved economic conditions that followed the Second World War, there was less need for soup kitchens in advanced economies.&lt;ref name = "sweet"&gt;{{cite book|author=Janet Poppendieck|title=Sweet Charity?: Emergency Food and the End of Entitlement|chapter=Introduction, Chpt 1|year=1999|isbn=0140245561|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, with the scaling back of welfare provision in the 1980s under [[Ronald Reagan|president Reagan]]'s administration, there was a rapid rise in activity from grass roots hunger relief agencies such as soup kitchens. According to a comprehensive government survey completed in 2002, over 90% of food banks, about 80% of emergency kitchens, and all known food rescue organisations, were established in the US after 1981.&lt;ref name= "sweet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="walter"/&gt; Presently, [[Catholic Charities USA]] of [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], founded by [[Sisters of Loretto|The Sisters of Loretto]], provides food to upwards of 600-700 persons or more per day, and has been doing so since 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccharitiescc.org/what-we-do/marian-house/soup-kitchen/|title=Marian House Soup Kitchen|author=|date=|website=ccharitiescc.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the 21st century==

Use of soup kitchens has grown rapidly across the world, following the lasting global inflation in the cost of food that began in late 2006. The ''global financial crisis'' further increased the demand for soup kitchens, as did the introduction of austerity policies that have become common in Europe since 2010. Modern soup kitchens are generally well regarded, though like their historical counterparts they are sometimes disliked by local residents for lowering the tone of a neighborhood.&lt;ref name="walter"&gt;{{cite book

=== World's largest soup kitchen===
[[File:Amritsar-golden-temple-00.JPG|thumb|The [[Harmandir Sahib]] at night]]
{{Main article|Harmandir Sahib}}
The world's largest soup kitchen run at the [[Sikhism|Sikhs]]' holiest shrine, [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], India, which according to ''Croatian Times'' can serve free food for up to 100,000 - 300,000 people every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.croatiantimes.com/news/Around_the_World/2013-04-12/32910/SCOFF_THAT_-_Free_Food_Daily_For_300,000_at_Worlds_largest_Soup_Kitchen

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]] (Kitchen), food is served to all visitors regardless of faith, religion, or background. Only vegetarian food is served and people eat together as equals. The institution of the [[Sikh]] langar, a community run free kitchen, was started by the first Sikh Guru, [[Guru Nanak]]. It was designed to uphold the principle of equality between all people regardless of religion, caste, colour, creed, age, gender, or social status. In addition to the ideals of equality, the tradition of langar expresses the ethics of sharing, community, inclusiveness, and oneness of humankind. Every Sikh [[Gurdwara|shrine]] has a [[Selfless service|religiously sanctioned moral and humanitarian obligation to serve]] and [[Langar (Sikhism)|provide hospitality, provisions, nourishments and meals]] to any man, regardless of race, creed, religious profession, identification, or affiliation.

=== Comparison with front line food banks and pantries===
[[File:US Navy 090806-N-6220J-004 Sailors and Navy Delayed Entry Program members serve breakfast to homeless men and women at Dorothy's Soup Kitchen in Salinas, Calif. during Salinas Navy Week community service event.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[United States Navy]] serve the homeless at Dorothy's Soup Kitchen, [[Salinas, California]] in 2009.]]
In some countries such as [[UK|Great Britain]], increased demand from hungry people has largely been met by [[food bank]]s, operating on the "front line" model, where they give food out directly to the hungry. In the USA, such establishments are called "food pantries"; Americans generally reserve the term "food bank" for entities which perform a warehouse-like function, distributing food to front line agencies, but not directly to the hungry themselves. Instead of providing hot meals, front line food banks and pantries hand out packages of groceries so that recipients can cook themselves several meals at home. This is often more convenient for the end user. They can receive food for up to a dozen or so meals at once, whereas with a soup kitchen, they typically only receive a single meal with each visit.{{efn|Although some soup kitchens also like to give visitors a second "carry out" meal.}}

Food banks typically have procedures needed to prevent unscrupulous people taking advantage of them, unlike soup kitchens which will usually give a meal to whomever turns up with no questions asked. The soup kitchen's greater accessibility can make it more suitable for assisting people with long-term dependence on food aid. Soup kitchens can also provide warmth, companionship, and the shared communal experience of dining with others, which can be especially valued by people such as disabled, pensioners, widowers, homeless and ex-homeless. In some countries such as Greece, soup kitchens have become the most widely used form of food aid, with ''[[The Guardian]]'' reporting in 2012, that an estimated 400,000 Greeks visit a soup kitchen each day.&lt;ref name = "Poverty"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "walter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In the wake of the attempted putsch, [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|President Recep Tayyip Erdogan]]'s government closed down media companies linked to exiled cleric [[Fethullah Gülen]] and his [[Hizmet|Hizmet Movement]]. Turkey's General Directorate for Press, Broadcasting, and Information also revoked at least 620 journalists' accreditations.

As a result of the crackdown, 2,308 media workers and journalists have lost their job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/11/brothers-critical-turkish-regime-arrested-after-tv-programme|title=Brothers critical of Turkish government arrested after TV programme|last=Letsch|first=Constanze|date=2016-09-11|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey's media purge has also occurred online: regulators blocked at least 30 news-related websites.&lt;ref name="cpj.org"/&gt; Websites not linked to Gülen's movement, such as [[WikiLeaks|Wikileaks]] and the Turkish satirical weekly ''Leman'', are among those blocked inside Turkey.

== Chronology of Purge ==

On Thursday July 21, six days after the failed coup d’état, Turkey’s parliament approved a bill declaring a state of emergency allowing the government to rule by decree for three months.&lt;ref name="London"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/21/turkey-parliament-expected-to-pass-erdogan-emergency-measures|title=Turkey MPs approve state of emergency bill allowing rule by decree|last=London|first=Kareem Shaheen Owen Bowcott in|date=2016-07-21|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, Erdogan announced that the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] had been suspended.

Under the [[Constitution of Turkey|Turkish constitution]], during a state of emergency, the government can overturn the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms, as long as it respects international laws.&lt;ref name="London"/&gt; However, the 15th article of the Turkish Constitution states that the ECHR cannot be suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allaboutturkey.com/constitution.htm|title=The Constitution - All About Turkey|website=www.allaboutturkey.com|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context and that of a [[2016–17 purges in Turkey|a wider purge in Turkey]] with 40,000 arrests and 160,000 suspensions of officials,&lt;ref name="Reuters0430"/&gt; President Erdogan initiated a purge of media and journalists suspected of sympathy with the [[Gülen movement]]&lt;ref name="gulenwebsite"&gt;[http://www.gulenmovement.us/gulen-movement/what-is-the-gulen-movement Gulen's Hizmet movement]&lt;/ref&gt;. On July 27th, Erdogan published a decree in [[T.C. Resmi Gazete|Turkey's official government gazette]],&lt;ref name="tcresmi_media_shutdown"&gt;http://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2016/07/20160727M2-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; ordering the shutdown of three news agencies, 16 TV channels, 23 radio channels, 45 newspapers, 15 magazines and 29 publishing houses (see list below).&lt;ref name="cpj.org"/&gt;

By the force of the state of emergency, "all goods, assets, rights, documents and papers [belonging to those media outlets] will be transferred, free of charge, to Turkish treasury with no appeal to be made".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/jul/29/press-freedom-groups-condemn-turkish-media-crackdown|title=Press freedom groups condemn Turkish media crackdown|last=Greenslade|first=Roy|date=2016-07-29|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, 89 arrest warrants were issued for journalists who were alleged plotters in the failed attempt to overthrow the government.&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/30/turkish-correspondent-tweets-arrests-of-42-journalists-in-turkey|title=17 Turkish journalists charged with terror group membership|last=Johnston|first=Chris|date=2016-07-30|last2=Forsdike|first2=Josy|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same week, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/30/turkey-journalists-arrest-nation-shock-coup 17 journalists] were charged with membership in Gülen’s movement, which the government considers a terrorist group.&lt;ref name="Johnston"/&gt;  On August 5, this number increased to 36 journalists indicted for the same charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cpj.org/blog/2016/08/turkey-crackdown-chronicle-week-of-july-31.php|title=Turkey Crackdown Chronicle: Week of July 31 - Committee to Protect Journalists|website=cpj.org|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish government justified the arrests for security reasons and said the journalists were being investigated and prosecuted for participating in criminal activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/29/stop-the-press-turkey-crackdown-journalists-overdrive-since-coup|title=Stop the press: Turkey's crackdown on its media goes into overdrive|last=Letsch|first=Constanze|date=2016-08-29|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 27, the [http://platform24.org/en/ Platform for Independent Journalism (P24)], a press freedom group, said the number of journalists arrested since the coup was 108.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/02/journalist-erdogan-arrests-turkey-crackdown-criticism-president|title=I’m a journalist on the run from Erdoğan – I have no idea what I’ve done|date=2016-09-02|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==

Press freedom groups have condemned the crackdown. The Turkish representative for [[Reporters Without Borders]] called the arrests "a witch hunt against journalists".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/25/turkey-issues-arrest-warrants-42-journalists-attempted-coup|title=Turkey issues warrants for 42 journalists in relation to failed coup|last=Letsch|first=Constanze|date=2016-07-25|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Kaye, the [[United Nations|UN]] special rapporteur on the right to freedom of expression said that "the attempted coup cannot justify such a broad attack against almost all voices, not just critical ones but analytic and journalistic."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20319&amp;LangID=E|title=Freedom of expression: UN and OSCE experts deplore crackdown on journalists and media outlets in Turkey|website=www.ohchr.org|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The disregard for any assurance of due process is flagrant and only contributes to the extreme levels of insecurity affecting all those working to inform people of the ongoing crisis in the country,"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  said Dunja Mijatović, the media freedom representative of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe]]’s representative on media freedom.

The [[Committee to Protect Journalists|Committee to Protect Journalist]]’s program coordinator for central Asia, Nina Ognianova, said that the "scale of this rout of the media is staggering." She added: "The government is exploiting a failed coup to silence the critical press when Turkey most needs pluralistic media."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cpj.org/2016/07/turkey-shutters-more-than-100-media-outlets-as-pur.php|title=Turkey shutters more than 100 media outlets as purge continues - Committee to Protect Journalists|website=cpj.org|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turkey director at [[Human Rights Watch]], Emma Sinclair-Webb, added to the criticism "In the absence of any evidence of their role or participation in the violent attempt to overthrow the government, we strongly condemn this accelerated assault on the media, which further undermines Turkey’s democratic credentials", she said.&lt;ref name="Johnston"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6535">In [[philosophy]], the '''unity of the proposition''' is the problem of explaining how a sentence in the [[indicative mood]] expresses more than just what a list of [[proper name]]s expresses.

== History ==

The problem was discussed under this name by [[Bertrand Russell]], but can be traced back to [[Plato]]. In Plato's ''[[Sophist_(dialogue)|Sophist]]'', the simplest kind of sentence consists of just a proper name and a [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] [[terminology|term]] (i.e. a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]). The name refers to or picks out some [[individual]] [[object (philosophy)|object]], and the predicate then says something about that individual.

The difficulty is to explain how the predicate does this.  If, as Plato thinks, the predicate is the name of some universal [[concept]] or [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-metaphysics/ form], how do we explain how the sentence comes to be [[Truth|true]] or false?  If, for example, "[[Socrates]] is wise" consists of just a name for Socrates, and a name for the universal concept of [[Wisdom]], how could the sentence be true ''or'' false?  In either case, the "Socrates" [[Sign (linguistics)|signifies]] Socrates, and the predicate signifies Wisdom.  But the sentence ''[[Logical assertion|asserts]]'' that Socrates is wise.  The assertion of wisdom must consist in the assertion of some relation between Socrates and Wisdom.  What is this relation?

The problem was discussed much later by [[F. H. Bradley|Francis Bradley]].  If we assume that a sentence consists of two objects and a relation that connects them, and we represent this by three names, say John, loving, Mary, how do we express the fact that John loves Mary?  For "John", "loving" and "Mary" would name the objects they do, even if this were not a fact.  This is known as [[Bradley's regress]].

== Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein ==

The problem became significant in the early development of [[set theory]].  Set membership is a [[Formal set theory|formal]] [[Knowledge representation|representation]] of the relation between the two parts of the proposition, and there are certain philosophical problems connected with this, as [[Frege]] realised when he investigated the distinction between [[concept and object]].  Assume that "Shergar is a horse" analyses into what "Shergar" names (an "Object", according to Frege), and what "is a horse" names (a "Concept").  Objects are fundamentally different from concepts, otherwise we get the problem of the unity of the proposition.  A predicate cannot function as the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of a sentence.  But what are we doing when we talk about the concept ''is a horse''? Aren't we using the expression "the concept ''is a horse''", and isn't that a subject expression, which refers (on Frege's account) to an Object? Yes, says Frege, and on that account the concept ''is a horse'' is not a concept at all. This is a [[dogma]] that even Frege's most faithful followers found difficult to swallow.

The difficulty was discussed in detail in ''[[Principia Mathematica|The Principles of Mathematics]]'' by Russell, who saw no resolution.

:There appears to be an ultimate notion of assertion, given by the verb, which is lost as soon as we substitute a verbal noun, and is lost when the proposition in question is made the subject of some other proposition. ...Thus the contradiction which was to have been avoided, of an entity which cannot be made a logical subject, appears to have here become inevitable.  This difficulty, which seems to be inherent in the very nature of truth and falsehood, is one with which I do not know how to deal with satisfactorily.  ...I therefore leave this question to the [[logic]]ians with the above brief indication of a difficulty. (§ 52)

Consider e.g. "A differs from B".  The constituents of this proposition are simply A, difference and B.  The proposition relates A and B, using the words "is ... from" in "A is different from B".  But if we represent this contribution by words for relations, as e.g. "A &lt;R&gt; difference &lt;R&gt; B" we are back to a list of terms, we are essentially back at Bradley's regress.
	
: A proposition, in fact, is essentially a ''unity'', and when analysis has destroyed the unity, no enumeration of constituents will restore the proposition. The verb, when used as a verb, embodies the unity of the proposition, and is thus distinguishable from the verb considered as a term, though I do not know how to give a clear account of the distinction. (§ 52)

[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] addresses the problem early on in the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''.  In section 2.01 he claims that "states of affairs" are combinations of objects. In section 2.03 he explains that nothing is needed to link the objects, since the objects ''hang together''.  The arrangement of words that in the sentence corresponds to the arrangement or ''structure'' of objects in the [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] expressed by the sentence. This is the so-called [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus#The picture theory|picture theory of the proposition]].

[[File:Winged sun sharpe.png|thumb|250px|"Winged Sun of Thebes" (from ''Egyptian Mythology and Egyptian Christianity'' by Samuel Sharpe, 1863)]]
The '''winged sun''' is a symbol associated with [[divinity]], [[Royal family|royalty]] and power in the [[Ancient Near East]] ([[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Anatolia]], and [[Persia]]).

== Ancient Egypt ==
In ancient Egypt, the symbol is attested from the [[Old Kingdom]] ([[Sneferu]], 26th century BC {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}), often flanked on either side with a [[uraeus]].
In early Egyptian religion, the symbol Behedeti represented [[Horus]] of [[Edfu]], later identified with [[Ra-Harachte]]. It is sometimes depicted on the neck of [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis]], the bull of [[Ptah]].  As time passed (according to interpretation) all of the subordinated gods of Egypt were considered to be aspects of the sun god, including e.g. [[Khepri]].

== Mesopotamia and the Levant ==
[[File:Nimrud stele winged sun.jpg|thumb|200px|Stele to [[Assurnasiripal II]] at [[Nimrud]] (9th century BC), detail showing the winged sun.]]

From roughly 2000 BC, the symbol also appears in the [[Levant]] and [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Asia Minor]]. It appears in reliefs with [[Assyria]]n rulers and in [[Hieroglyphic Luwian|Hieroglyphic Anatolian]] as a symbol for royalty, transcribed into [[Latin]] as SOL SUUS (literally, "his own self, the Sun", i.e., "His Majesty").

== Hebrew ==
From ca. the 8th century BC, the winged solar disk appears on [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] seals connected to the royal house of the [[Kingdom of Judah]]. Many of these are seals and jar handles from [[Hezekiah]]'s reign, together with the inscription ''l'melekh'' ("belonging to the king").&lt;ref name=Deutsch2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deutsch|first1=Robert|title=Lasting Impressions: New bullae reveal Egyptian-style emblems on Judah’s royal seals|journal=Biblical Archaeology Review|date=July–August 2002|volume=28|issue=4|pages=42–51|url=http://www.archaeological-center.com/en/monographs/m13/|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, Hezekiah's royal seals feature two downward-pointing wings and six rays emanating from the central sun disk, and some are flanked on either side with the Egyptian [[ankh]] ("key of life") symbol.&lt;ref name=Deutsch2002 /&gt; Prior to this, there are examples from the seals of servants of king [[Ahaz]] and of king [[Uzziah]].&lt;ref name=Sarlo2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sarlo|first1=Daniel|title=Winged Scarab Imagery in Judah: Yahweh as Khepri|journal=Eastern Great Lakes Biblical Society Annual Meeting, Erie, PA|date=2014|url=https://www.academia.edu/5562359/Winged_Scarab_Imagery_in_Judah_Yahweh_as_Khepri|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compare also [[Malachi]] 4:2, referring to a winged "Sun of righteousness",
:''But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings...'' ([[KJV]])

== Zoroastrianism ==
[[File:Persepolis Bas-Relief.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Faravahar]] in the [[Persepolis]]. Also a small winged sun is below of it, click on the image to see.]]
The symbol evolved into the  [[Faravahar]] (the "visual aspect of [[Ahura Mazda]]") in [[Zoroastrian]] [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]].

==Greece==
The winged sun is conventionally depicted as the knob of the [[Staff of Hermes]].

==Modern use==
[[File:Winged Sun alchemical.jpg|thumb|200px|As an [[alchemical symbol]]: a winged sun hovers over a sepulchre filled with water (from ''[[Rosary of the Philosophers]]'').]]
The symbol was used on the cover of [[Charles Taze Russell]]'s textbook series ''[[Studies in the Scriptures]]'' beginning with the  1911 editions. Various groups such as [[Freemasonry]],  [[Rosicrucianism]], [[Thelema]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[Unity Church]] have also used it.  Variations of the symbol are used as a trademark logo on vehicles produced by the [[Chrysler]] Corporation, and [[Harley Davidson]].

==Heraldic use==
A winged sun is used in the heraldry of the North America Trade Directory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northamerica-trade.com/heraldic.htm Heraldic information of the North America Trade Directory] (retrieved November 28, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22935">The '''World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB)''' is an international [[soil classification]] system for naming soils and creating legends for soil maps. The currently valid version is the Update 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/i3794en/I3794en.pdf|title=World Reference Base for Soil Resources 2014, Update 2015|last=IUSS Working Group WRB|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the third edition 2014. It is edited by a working group of the [[International Union of Soil Sciences]] (IUSS).

== History ==
Since the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, several countries developed national [[soil classification]] systems. During the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the need for an international soil classification system became more and more obvious. 

From 1971 to 1981, the Food and Agriculture Organization ([[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]]) and [[UNESCO|UNESCO]] published the [[Soil Map of the World]], 10 volumes, scale 1 : 5 M. The Legend for this map, published in 1974 under the leadership of Rudi Dudal, became the [[FAO soil classification]]. Many ideas from national soil classification systems were brought together in this worldwide-applicable system, among them the idea of diagnostic horizons as established in the ‘7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; approximation to the [[USDA soil taxonomy]]’ from 1960. The next step was the Revised Legend of the Soil Map of the World, published in 1988.

In 1982, the International Soil Science Society (ISSS; now: [[International Union of Soil Sciences]], IUSS) established a working group named International Reference Base for Soil Classification (IRB)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iuss.boku.ac.at/files/iuss126_def_72dpi.pdf|title=IUSS Bulletion 126, page 38-45|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Chair of this working group was Ernst Schlichting. Its mandate was to develop an international soil classification system that should better consider soil-forming processes than the FAO soil classification. Drafts were presented in 1982 and 1990.

In 1992, the IRB working group decided to develop a new system named World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) that should further develop the Revised Legend of the [[FAO soil classification]] and include some ideas of the more systematic IRB approach. Otto Spaargaren ([[International Soil Reference and Information Centre]]) and Freddy Nachtergaele ([[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]]) were nominated to prepare a draft. This draft was presented at the 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[World Congress of Soil Science]] in Acapulco in 1994. At the same congress, the WRB was established as an ISSS working group replacing the IRB. At the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; World Congress of Soil Science in Montpellier in 1998, the first edition of the WRB was published. At the same congress, the ISSS endorsed the WRB as its correlation system for soil classification. (In 2014, the [[USDA soil taxonomy]] also received the status of a correlation system.) At the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; World Congress of Soil Science in Philadelphia in 2006, the second edition of the WRB was presented, and at the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; World Congress of Soil Science in Jeju in 2014, the third edition. An update of the third edition was issued in 2015. Whereas the second edition was only suitable for naming soils, the third edition can additionally be used for creating map legends.

The WRB has only two hierarchical levels (see below) and has in that sense a similar approach as the French référencial pédologique (1992, 1995, 2008). Contrary to that, the [[USDA soil taxonomy]] is strongly hierarchical and has six levels. The classification in WRB is based mainly on soil morphology (field and laboratory data) as an expression of [[pedogenesis]]. Another difference with USDA soil taxonomy is that soil climate is regarded only as a soil-forming factor and not as a soil characteristic. The WRB is not meant to replace national soil classification systems, which, for their area, may be more detailed than the WRB.

== The editor of the WRB ==
The WRB is edited by a working group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iuss.org/index.php?article_id=42|title=List of the IUSS working groups|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[International Union of Soil Sciences]] (IUSS). The current chair of the working group is Peter Schad ([[Technical University of Munich]], Germany, since 2010). The current vice-chair is Stephan Mantel ([[International Soil Reference and Information Centre]], The Netherlands, since 2018). 

Chairs of the WRB working group and responsible first authors of the WRB editions are: Seppe Deckers (Belgium, 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; edition 1998), Erika Michéli (Hungary, 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; edition 2006) and Peter Schad (Germany, 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; edition 2014).

== The WRB 2015 ==

=== The architecture of the WRB ===
The classification is based on '''diagnostic horizons''', '''diagnostic properties''' and '''diagnostic materials''', altogether called '''diagnostics'''. Diagnostic materials are materials that significantly influence soil-forming processes ([[pedogenesis]]). They are either inherited from the parent material or the result of soil-forming processes. Diagnostic properties are typical results of soil-forming processes or reflect specific conditions of soil formation. Diagnostic horizons are typical results of soil-forming processes that show a minimum thickness and therefore a horizontal appearance. 

The diagnostics have names (e. g. argic horizon, stagnic properties, fluvic material), The WRB does not use horizons symbols (A horizons, B horizons). Therefore, horizons that are not diagnostic, do not have names. Instead, WRB recommends using the horizon symbols provided by the FAO Guidelines for Soil Description (2006). 

The classification comprises two levels: 

The first level has 32 '''Reference Soil Groups''' (RSGs).

At the second level, for further differentiation a set of '''qualifiers''' is added to the name of the RSG. There are 185 qualifiers in total. For every RSG, there is a list of available qualifiers, which are subdivided into two types: 

* '''Principal qualifiers''' describe typical characteristics of a RSG. They are ranked and given in an order of importance. They are placed before the name of the RSG.
* '''Supplementary qualifiers''' describe additional characteristics. They are not ranked and used in alphabetical order. They are placed after the name of the RSG in brackets and separated from each other by commas.

The names of the RSGs and the qualifiers start with capital letters. They must be given in English and must not be translated into any other language in order to guarantee that a certain soil has the same name all over the world. 

=== Naming a soil with the WRB ===
A key is used for allocating a soil to a certain RSG. In a defined sequence, the key asks for the presence or absence of certain diagnostics in a certain depth range. In addition, the key asks for single characteristics, e. g., a certain clay content or a certain base saturation. The soil belongs to the first RSG, for which it fulfils the set of criteria.

The qualifiers available for use with a particular RSG are listed in the key, along with the RSG. Their number is from 35 to 68. All applying qualifiers must be added to the soil name. The principal qualifiers are added before the name of the RSG. The sequence is from right to left, i.e. the uppermost qualifier in the list is placed closest to the name of the RSG. The supplementary qualifiers are added in brackets after the name of the RSG and are separated from each other by commas. The sequence is from left to right, i.e. the first qualifier according to the alphabet is placed closest to the name of the RSG. If no other principal qualifier applies, the Haplic qualifier is used. If two or more qualifiers in the list are separated by a slash (/) only one of them can be used. The slash signifies that these qualifiers are either mutually exclusive (e.g. Dystric and Eutric) or one of them is redundant with the redundant qualifier(s) listed after the slash(es). In the soil name, supplementary qualifiers are always placed in the order of the alphabet, even if their position in the list differs from alphabetical sequence due to the use of the slash. It is a general rule that qualifiers conveying redundant information are not used. Example: If a soil has the Calcaric qualifier (carbonates present) the Eutric qualifier (high base saturation) is not used.

Qualifiers may be combined with specifiers (e.g. Epi-, Proto-) to form subqualifiers (e.g. Epiarenic, Protocalcic). The depth-related specifiers are of special importance, although their use is optional:

* Epi-: only from 0 to ≤50 cm,
* Endo-: only below &gt;50 cm,
* Amphi-: only from &gt;0 to &lt;100 cm,
* Ano-: only from 0 to &gt;50 and &lt;100 cm,
* Kato-: only from &gt;0 to ≥100 cm
* Panto-: from 0 to ≥100 cm

=== Creating map legends with the WRB ===
The number of qualifiers used in a map legend depends on the scale. The WRB distinguishes four map scale levels: 

* first map scale level: RSG only,
* second map scale level: the RSG plus the first applying principal qualifier,
* third map scale level: the RSG plus the first two applying principal qualifiers,
* fourth map scale level: the RSG plus the first three applying principal qualifiers.

Correlating the map scale levels with concrete scales (e.g. fourth map scale level from 1 : 250 000 to 1 : 1 000 000) is difficult because selecting a map scale level depends very much from the homogeneity/heterogeneity of the landscape.

The principal qualifiers are added before the name of the RSG following the rules explained for naming a soil. Depending on the purpose of the map or according to national traditions, at any scale level, further qualifiers may be added optionally. They may be additional principal qualifiers from further down the list and not already used in the soil name, or they may be supplementary qualifiers. They are placed using the above-mentioned rules for supplementary qualifiers; principal qualifiers first, then supplementary qualifiers.

The WRB recommends that on a map unit not just one soil is indicated but an association of soils. For this purpose, WRB uses the following nomenclature: 

* dominant: the soil represents &gt;50 % of the soil cover,
* codominant: the soil represents 25 - 50 % of the soil cover,
* associated: the soil represents 5 - 25 % of the soil cover. 

For codominant and associated soils, it is allowed to use less principal qualifiers than would correspondent to the used map scale level. The use of specifiers is not recommended due to the generalization that is required when making maps. In map legends, the names of the RSGs are given in plural; in all other cases they are given in singular. 

=== The WRB Manual ===
The WRB Manual comprises five chapters and four annexes. 

Chapter 1 reports on background and basics. It includes tables of the diagnostic horizons and of the RSGs. The latter is given below. Chapter 2 provides the rules for classifying soils and creating map legends. It is highly recommended to read this short chapter before using the WRB. Chapter 3 presents the diagnostic horizons, properties and materials, each with a general description, the diagnostic criteria and some additional information. For the decision, whether a diagnostic is present or absent in a soil, only the diagnostic criteria are relevant. Chapter 4 provides the key to the RSGs and for every RSG a list with the available principal and supplementary qualifiers. Chapter 5 gives the definitions of the qualifiers. These five chapters are concluded with a list of references. 

They are followed by four annexes. Annex 1 briefly describes the 32 RSGs. Annex 2 lists the laboratory methods. This is only a list; it is not a laboratory manual. Annex 3 gives the codes for the RSGs, the qualifiers and the specifiers and the rules for the sequence of the codes for naming soils and creating map legends. Annex 4 provides a texture triangle, in which the ranges of the texture-related qualifiers are marked with different grey shades.

== Examples ==

=== Example for naming a soil with the WRB ===
Our example soil has the following characteristics: 

Field characteristics: A soil developed from [[loess]] shows a marked clay increase in around 60 cm depth and clay coatings in the clay-richer horizon. According to the landscape setting, we presume that high-activity clays dominate. In the field, a pH value of 6 is measured in the subsoil. The lower part of the clay-poorer topsoil is bleached. In the clay-richer horizon, we observe a mottling; the oximorphic and the reductimorphic colours sum up to 30% of the exposed area, the intensive colours in the interiors of the aggregates. In spring time, reducing conditions occur. The soil is ploughed regularly. Organic matter concentrations in the topsoil are small.

Laboratory characteristics: The laboratory analyses confirm the high [[Cation-exchange capacity|cation exchange capacity]] per kg clay in the clay-richer horizon and the high base saturation in the subsoil. In the topsoil, we find 20% [[clay]], 10% [[sand]] and 70% [[silt]], in the subsoil 35% clay, 10% sand and 55% silt. 

The naming of the soil consists of four steps. 

'''Question 1: Does the soil have diagnostic horizons, properties and materials?''' 

The soil has the following diagnostics: 

* albic material (in the bleached horizon)
* argic horizon (clay-richer horizon)
* stagnic properties (in the clay-richer horizon)
* reducing conditions (in the clay-richer horizon)

'''Question 2: To which RSG does the soil belong?''' 

We have to go through the key RSG for RSG. This soil is not a Histosol, not an Anthrosol, not a Technosol etc. Finally, we end up with the [[Luvisols]]. This is the first RSG in the key, the criteria of which our soil completely fulfils. 

'''Question 3: Which qualifiers apply?''' 

From the list of the principal qualifiers, Stagnic (stagnic properties und reducing conditions) and Albic (light colours) apply. Stagnic is found further up in the list. Therefore, the soil has to be named up till now Albic Stagnic Luvisol. From the list of the supplementary qualifiers, Siltic (silty from 0 to 60 cm), Loamic (loamy from 60 cm downwards), Aric (ploughed), Cutanic (clay coatings) und Ochric (small concentrations of organic carbon) apply. Bringing the supplementary qualifiers into the alphabetical order, the soil is an Albic Stagnic Luvisol (Aric, Cutanic, Loamic, Ochric, Siltic). 

'''Question 4: Which specifiers can be used to form subqualifiers?''' 

The soil is Siltic from 0 to 60 cm and Loamic from 60 cm downwards. We can use the depth-related specifiers Ano- and Endo- to construct the subqualifiers Anosiltic and Endoloamic. The stagnic properties occur only in the subsoil and the albic material only around 50 cm. This means that we can use the subqualifiers Endostagnic and Amphialbic. 

Now, the soil name is: Amphialbic Endostagnic Luvisol (Aric, Cutanic, Endoloamic, Ochric, Anosiltic). 

Using the codes of Annex 3 of the WRB Manual gives us the following short name: LV-stn.abm-ai.ct.lon.oh.sia. 

=== Example for creating map legends with the WRB ===
Let’s say that our example soil Amphialbic Endostagnic [[Luvisol]] (Aric, Cutanic, Endoloamic, Ochric, Anosiltic) covers 60% of the area of a map unit. The other 40% are covered by a Eutric Endoluvic Amphialbic [[Stagnosol]] (Humic, Endoloamic, Anosiltic). The map unit will be named as follows: 

First map scale level: 

* dominant: Luvisols
* codominant: Stagnosols

Second map scale level: 

* dominant: Stagnic Luvisols
* codominant: Albic Stagnosols

Third map scale level: 

* dominant: Albic Stagnic Luvisols
* codominant: Luvic Albic Stagnosols

Fourth map scale level: 

* dominant: Albic Stagnic Luvisols
* codominant: Eutric Luvic Albic Stagnosols

Remarks: The use of the depth-related specifiers is not recommended in map legends, where generalization is required. The fourth scale level would allow three principal qualifiers, but the dominant soil in our example has only two. 

At every scale level, optional qualifiers may be added. If one wants to give information about organic carbon, one can do that even at the first map scale level and write: 

* dominant: Luvisols (Ochric)
* codominant: Stagnosols (Humic)

If somebody wants to give additional information on soil genesis, this can also be done on the first map scale level: 

* dominant: Luvisols (Stagnic)
* codominant: Stagnosols (Luvic)

Both in combination would read, e. g., at the second map scale level: 

* dominant: Stagnic Luvisols (Ochric)
* codominant: Albic Stagnosols (Luvic, Humic)

====Political Exile====
On May 16, 1961, [[Park Chung-hee]], [[Kim Jong-pil]], and Lee Nak-sun successfully staged a military coup d'etat. Immediately after, [[Park Chung-hee]] sent aides to try and win over key opposition lawmakers including Lee who rejected Park's request for help. Lee was forced to leave politics and went to the United States where he was vocally opposed to the military coup in Korea and studied Political Science at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].
