The term '''anal retentive''' (also '''anally retentive'''), often abbreviated to '''anal''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memidex.com/anal-retentive |title=anal-retentive |work=Memidex/WordNet Dictionary/Thesaurus |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used to describe a person who pays such attention to detail that it becomes an obsession and may be an annoyance to others, potentially to the detriment of the anal-retentive person. The term derives from [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[psychoanalysis]].

==Origins==
In Freudian psychology, the [[anal stage]] is said to follow the [[oral stage]] of [[infant development|infant]] or [[Child development|early-childhood development]]. This is a time when an infant's attention moves from oral stimulation to anal stimulation (usually the [[bowel]]s but occasionally the [[bladder]]), usually synchronous with learning to control their excretory functions—in other words, any form of child training and not specifically linked to toilet training.  Freud posited that children who experience conflicts, in which libido energy is under-indulged during this period of time, and the child is perhaps too strongly chastised for toilet-training accidents, may develop "anal retentive" fixations or personality traits.  These traits are associated with a child's efforts at excretory control: orderliness, stubbornness, and compulsions for control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Hall |first = Calvin S. |title = A Primer of Freudian Psychology |publisher = [[New American Library]] |year = 1954 |location = New York |page = 108 |isbn = 0-452-01183-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, those who are overindulged during this period may develop "[[anal-expulsive]]" personality types.

Freud's theories on early childhood have been influential on the [[psychological]] community; the phrase ''anal retentive'' and the term ''anal'' survive in common usage. The second edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' (DSM-II) introduced [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder]] (OCPD), with a definition based on Freud's description of anal-retentive personality.&lt;ref name="Pinto 2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pinto |first=Anthon y|first2=Jane L. |last2=Eisen |first3=Maria C. |last3=Mancebo |first4=Steven A. |last4=Rasmussen |year=2008 |publisher=Elsevier |pages=246–263 |title=Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Subtypes and Spectrum Conditions |chapter=Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder |editor-first1=Jonathan S. |editor-last1=Abramowitz |editor-first2=Dean |editor-last2=McKay |editor-first3=Steven |editor-last3=Taylor |isbn=978-0-08-044701-8 |chapter-url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/B9780080447018500164/3-s2.0-B9780080447018500164-main.pdf?_tid=5e5920c6-6e10-11e6-8885-00000aab0f02&amp;acdnat=1472492906_7d594e8d9e99c696b9336666dab25769}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the association between OCPD and toilet training is largely regarded as unsupported "[[Popular psychology|pop-psychology]]" and therefore discredited by the majority of psychologists of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.&lt;ref name=berger&gt;{{cite book |last = Berger |first = Kathleen |title = The Developing Person |publisher = Worth Publishers |year = 2000 |location = New York |pages = 218 |isbn = 1-57259-417-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no conclusive research linking anal stage conflicts with "anal" personality types.&lt;ref name="berger" /&gt; Research suggests that the overall pattern of [[Parenting styles|parental attitudes]] has a much more concrete effect on how an infant will grow up.

A "'''backlash'''" is an adverse reaction to something which has gained popularity, prominence, or influence. Although it can sometimes represent a categorical rejection of the idea, aesthetic, product, or fad in question, it is usually a reflection of a collective resentment of that thing's ubiquity in [[culture]] and [[Mass media|media]], rather than a denial of its existence. The term is commonly applied to gender and [[racial discrimination]] and [[religious discrimination]] against [[minority group|minority]] groups, as well, such as in response to certain events or circumstances.

'''Behavior modification''' refers to [[behavioral change theories|behavior-change procedures]] that were employed during the 1970s and early 1980s. Based on methodological behaviorism,&lt;ref name=Annualreviewbehaviortherapy&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Behavior modification: delusion or deliverance?|author=Mahoney, M. J., Kazdin, A. E., &amp; Lesswing, N. J.|author2=Franks, C. M., Wilson, G. T.|pages=11–40|title=Annual Review of Behavior Therapy: Theory and Practice|volume=2|publisher=Brunner/Mazel|date=1974|accessdate=December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; overt behavior was modified with presumed consequences, including artificial positive and negative [[reinforcement]] contingencies to increase desirable behavior, or administering positive and negative [[punishment]] and/or [[extinction (psychology)|extinction]] to reduce problematic behavior.&lt;ref name=Mace1994&gt;{{cite journal|title=The significance and future of functional analysis methodologies|author=Mace, F.

[[Applied behavior analysis]] (ABA)&amp;mdash;the application of behavior analysis&amp;mdash;is based on [[radical behaviorism]], which refers to [[B. F. Skinner]]'s viewpoint that cognition and emotions are covert behavior that are to be subjected to the same conditions as overt behavior.

==Description==
The first use of the term behavior modification appears to have been by [[Edward Thorndike]] in 1911. His article ''Provisional Laws of Acquired Behavior or Learning'' makes frequent use of the term "modifying behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Thorndike |first=E.L. |year=1911 |title=Provisional Laws of Acquired Behavior or Learning |journal=Animal Intelligence |publisher=The McMillian Company |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through early research in the 1940s and the 1950s the term was used by [[Joseph Wolpe]]'s research group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wolpe |first=J. |year=1968 |title=Psychotheraphy by Reciprocal Inhibition |journal=Conditional Reflex |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=234–240 |doi=10.1007/BF03000093 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The experimental tradition in clinical psychology used it to refer to psycho-therapeutic techniques derived from empirical research.&lt;ref&gt;In {{cite book |editor-first=A. J. |editor-last=Bachrach |title=Experimental Foundations of Clinical Psychology |pages=3–25 |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=1962 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since come to refer mainly to techniques for increasing adaptive behavior through reinforcement and decreasing maladaptive behavior through extinction or punishment (with emphasis on the former).

In recent years, the concept of [[punishment (psychology)|punishment]] has had many critics, though these criticisms tend not to apply to negative punishment (time-outs) and usually apply to the addition of some aversive event. The use of [[positive punishment]] by board certified behavior analysts is restricted to extreme circumstances when all other forms of treatment have failed and when the behavior to be modified is a danger to the person or to others (see [[professional practice of behavior analysis]]). In clinical settings positive punishment is usually restricted to using a spray bottle filled with water as an aversive event. When misused, more aversive punishment can lead to affective (emotional) disorders, as well as to the receiver of the punishment increasingly trying to avoid the punishment (i.e., "not get caught").

Behavior modification relies on the following:
* [[Reinforcement]] (Positive and Negative)
* [[Punishment (psychology)|Punishment]] (Positive and Negative)
* [[Extinction (psychology)|Extinction]]
* [[Shaping (psychology)|Shaping]]
* [[Applied behavior analysis#Fading|Fading]]
* [[Chaining]]

==Some areas of effectiveness==
[[Functional analysis (psychology)|Functional behavior assessment]] forms the core of [[applied behavior analysis]]. Many techniques in this therapy are specific techniques aimed at specific issues. Interventions based on behavior analytic principles have been extremely effective in developing evidence-based treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Donohue |first=W. |last2=Ferguson |first2=K. E. |year=2006 |title=Evidence-Based Practice in Psychology and Behavior Analysis |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=335–52 |doi=10.1037/h0100155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the above, a growing list of research-based interventions from the behavioral paradigm exist. With children with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), one study showed that over a several year period, children in the behavior modification group had half the number of felony arrests as children in the medication group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Satterfield |first=J. H. |last2=Satterfield |first2=B. T. |last3=Schell |first3=A. M. |year=1987 |title=Therapeutic interventions to prevent delinquency in hyperactive boys |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=56–64 |doi=10.1097/00004583-198701000-00012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Satterfield |first=J. H. |last2=Schell |first2=A. |year=1997 |title=A prospective study of hyperactive boys with conduct problems and normal boys: Adolescent and adult criminality |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry |volume=36 |issue=12 |pages=1726–35 |doi=10.1097/00004583-199712000-00021 |pmid=9401334}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings have yet to be replicated, but are considered encouraging for the use of behavior modification for children with ADHD. There is strong and consistent evidence that behavioral treatments are effective for treating ADHD. A recent [[meta-analysis]] found that the use of behavior modification for ADHD resulted in effect sizes in between group studies (.83), pre-post studies (.70), within group studies (2.64), and single subject studies (3.78) indicating behavioral treatments are highly effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fabianoa |first=G. A. |last2=Pelham Jr. |first2=W. E. |last3=Colesb |first3=E. K. |last4=Gnagya |first4=E. M. |last5=Chronis-Tuscanoc |first5=A. |last6=O'Connora |first6=B. C. |year=2008 |title=A meta-analysis of behavioral treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=129–40 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2008.11.001 |pmid=19131150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavior modification programs form the core of many residential [[Behavior Modification Facility|treatment facility]] programs. They have shown success in reducing recidivism for adolescents with conduct problems and adult offenders. One particular program that is of interest is ''teaching-family homes'' (see [[Teaching Family Model]]), which is based on a social learning model that emerged from [[radical behaviorism]]. These particular homes use a family style approach to residential treatment, which has been carefully replicated over 700 times.&lt;ref&gt;Dean L. Fixsen, Karen A. Blasé, Gary D. Timbers and Montrose M. Wolf (2007) In Search of Program Implementation: 792 Replications of the Teaching-Family Model. ''Behavior Analyst Today'' Volume 8, No. 1, pp. 96–106 [http://www.baojournal.com Behavior Analyst Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent efforts have seen a push for the inclusion of more behavior modification programs in residential re-entry programs in the U.S. to aid prisoners in re-adjusting after release.

One area that has repeatedly shown effectiveness has been the work of [[behaviorist]]s working in the area of community reinforcement for addictions.&lt;ref&gt;Milford, J.L.; Austin, J.L.; Smith, J.E. (2007). Community Reinforcement and the Dissemination of Evidence-based Practice: Implications for Public Policy. ''IJBCT'', 3(1), pp. 77–87 [http://www.baojournal.com])&lt;/ref&gt; Another area of research that has been strongly supported has been behavioral activation for depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spates | first1 = R.C. | last2 = Pagoto | first2 = S. | last3 = Kalata | first3 = A. | year = 2006 | title = A Qualitative and Quantitative Review of Behavioral Activation Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder | url = http://www.baojournal.com | journal = The Behavior Analyst Today | volume = 7 | issue = 4| pages = 508–17 | doi=10.1037/h0100089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way of giving positive reinforcement in behavior modification is in providing compliments, approval, encouragement, and affirmation; a ratio of five compliments for every one complaint is generally seen as being [[effective]] in altering behavior in a desired manner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kirkhart |first=Robert |last2=Kirkhart |first2=Evelyn |chapter=The Bruised Self: Mending in the Early Years |editor-first=Kaoru |editor-last=Yamamoto |title=The Child and His Image: Self Concept in the Early Years |location=New York |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1972 |isbn=0-395-12571-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and even in producing stable marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gottman | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Levenson | first2 = R.W. | year = 1999 | title = What predicts change in marital interaction over time? A study of alternative models | url = | journal = Family Process | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 143–58 | doi=10.1111/j.1545-5300.1999.00143.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of notable interest is that the right behavioral intervention can have profound system effects. For example, Forgatch and DeGarmo (2007) found that with mothers who were recently divorced, a standard round of [[parent management training]] (programs based on social learning principles that teaches rewarding good behavior and ignoring bad behavior combined with communication skills) could help elevate the divorced mother out of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Forgatch | first1 = M. | last2 = DeGarmo | first2 =  | year = 2007 | title = Accelerating recovery from poverty: Prevention effects for recently separated mothers | url = | journal = Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention | volume = 4 | issue = 4| pages = 681–72 | doi=10.1037/h0100400| pmc = 2587348}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, parent management training programs, sometimes referred to as behavioral parent training programs, have shown relative cost effectiveness for their efforts&lt;ref&gt;Olchowski, A.E.; Foster, E.M.; Webster-Stratton, C.H. (2007). Implementing Behavioral Intervention Components in a Cost-Effective Manner: Analysis of the Incredible Years Program. ''Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention'', Vol. 3(4) and Vol. 4(1), Combined Edition, pp. 284–304.&lt;/ref&gt; for the treatment of conduct disorder. Thus, such intervention can have profound effects on socializing the child in a relatively cost effective fashion and help get the parent out of poverty. This level of effect is often looked for and valued by those who practice [[behavioral engineering]] and results of this type have caused the Association for Behavior Analysis International to take a position that those receiving treatment have a right to effective treatment &lt;ref&gt;[https://apps.abainternational.org/ABA/statements/treatment.asp ABA:I] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119000000/https://apps.abainternational.org/ABA/statements/treatment.asp |date=November 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a right to effective education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://apps.abainternational.org/ABA/statements/education.asp ABA:I]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In job performance==
Based on the conceptual premises of classical behaviorism and reinforcement theory, the Organizational Behavior Modification Model (aka O.B. Mod) represents a behavioral approach to the management of human resources in organizational settings.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stajkovic, A. D., &amp; Luthans, F.|first=|date=1997|title=A meta-analysis of the effects of organizational behavior modification on task performance, 1975-1995|url=|journal=Academy of Management|volume=40|pages=1122–1149|via=|doi=10.2307/256929}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of reinforcement theory to modification of behavior as it relates to job performance first requires analysis of necessary antecedents (e.g., job design, training) of the desired behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After it has been determined that the necessary antecedents are present, managers must first identify the behaviors to change. These behaviors must be observable, measurable, task-related, and critical to the task at hand. Next, a baseline measure of the behavior must be assessed and functional consequences analyzed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Now that the link between the antecedent, behavior, and contingent consequences has been established, an intervention to change the behavior can be introduced. If the intervention is successful in modifying the behavior, it must be maintained using schedules of reinforcement and must be evaluated for performance improvement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The O.B. Mod has been found to have a significant positive effect on task performance globally,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luthans, F., Stajkovic, A. D., Luthans, B. C., &amp; Lutherans, K. W.|first=|date=1998|title=Applying Behavioral Management in Eastern Europe|url=|journal=European Management Journal|volume=16|pages=446–475|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with performance on average increasing 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luthans, F., &amp; Stajkovic, A. D.|first=|date=1999|title=Reinforce for performance: The need to go beyond pay and even rewards|url=|journal=Academy of Management Executive|volume=13|pages=49–57|via=|doi=10.5465/ame.1999.1899548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study that examined the differential effects of incentive motivators administered with the O.B. Mod on job performance found that using money as a reinforcer with O.B. Mod was more successful at increasing performance compared to routine pay for performance (i.e., money administered on performance not using O.B. Mod).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stajkovic, A. D., &amp; Luthans, F.|first=|date=2001|title=Differential effects of incentive motivators on work performance|url=|journal=Academy of Management Journal|volume=4|pages=580–590|via=|doi=10.2307/3069372}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors also found that using money administered through the O.B. Mod produced stronger effects (37% performance increase), compared to social recognition (24% performance increase) and performance feedback (20% performance increase).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Behavior modification is critiqued in person-centered psychotherapeutic approaches such as [[Person-centered therapy|Rogerian Counseling]] and [[Re-evaluation Counseling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rc.org/|title=Re-evaluation Counseling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which involve "connecting with the human qualities of the person to promote healing", while behaviorism is "denigrating to the human spirit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holland | first1 = J.L. | year = 1976 | title = A new synthesis for an old method and a new analysis of some old phenomena | url = | journal = The Counseling Psychologist | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 12–15 | doi=10.1177/001100007600600303}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[B.F. Skinner]] argues in ''[[Beyond Freedom and Dignity]]'' that unrestricted reinforcement is what led to the "feeling of freedom", thus removal of aversive events allows people to "feel freer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=B. F. |last=Skinner |year=1974 |title=Beyond Freedom and Dignity |location=Harmondsworth |publisher=Penguin |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further criticism extends to the presumption that behavior increases only when it is reinforced. This premise is at odds with research conducted by [[Albert Bandura]] at Stanford University. His findings indicate that violent behavior is imitated, without being reinforced, in studies conducted with children watching films showing various individuals "beating the daylights out of Bobo". Bandura believes that human personality and learning is the result of the interaction between environment, behavior and psychological process. There is evidence, however, that imitation is a class of behavior that can be learned just like anything else. Children have been shown to imitate behavior that they have never displayed before and are never reinforced for, after being taught to imitate in general.&lt;ref&gt;D. Baer, R.F.; Peterson, J.A. Sherman Psychological Modeling: Conflicting Theories, 2006{{Incomplete short citation|date=February 2015}} &lt;!-- Is it ISBN 0202308480 ? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Several people have criticized the level of training required to perform behavior modification procedures, especially those that are restrictive or use [[aversives]], [[aversion therapy]], or [[punishment]] protocols. Some desire to limit such restrictive procedures only to licensed psychologists or licensed counselors. Once licensed for this group, post-licensed certification in behavior modification is sought to show scope of competence in the area through groups like the World Association for Behavior Analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baojournal.com/WCBA/WCBA.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110222511/http://www.baojournal.com/WCBA/WCBA.html |archivedate=2011-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still others desire to create an independent practice of behavior analysis through licensure to offer consumers choices between proven techniques and unproven ones (see [[Professional practice of behavior analysis]]). Level of training and consumer protection remain of critical importance in [[applied behavior analysis]] and behavior modification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10458">In [[mathematical physics]], the '''[[Frederik Belinfante|Belinfante]]–[[Léon Rosenfeld|Rosenfeld]] tensor''' is a modification of the energy–momentum tensor that is constructed from the canonical energy–momentum tensor and the spin current so as to be  symmetric yet still conserved.

In a [[classical field theory|classical]] or [[quantum field theory|quantum]] local field theory, the generator of [[Lorentz transformation]]s  can be written as an integral

: &lt;math&gt;M_{\mu\nu} = \int \mathrm{d}^3x \, {M^0}_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

of a local current

: &lt;math&gt;{M^\mu}_{\nu\lambda}= (x_\nu {T^\mu}_\lambda - x_\lambda {T^\mu}_\nu)+ {S^\mu}_{\nu\lambda}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;{T^\mu}_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the canonical [[Noether's theorem|Noether]] [[energy–momentum tensor]], and &lt;math&gt; {S^{\mu}}_{\nu\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; is the contribution of the intrinsic (spin) [[angular momentum]].  Local conservation of angular momentum

: &lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu {M^\mu}_{\nu\lambda}=0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

requires that

: &lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu {S^\mu}_{\nu\lambda}=T_{\lambda\nu}-T_{\nu\lambda}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus a source of [[spin tensor|spin-current]] implies a non-symmetric canonical energy–momentum tensor.

The Belinfante–Rosenfeld tensor&lt;ref name="belinfante"&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. J. Belinfante|title=On the current and the density of the electric charge, the energy, the linear momentum and the angular momentum of arbitrary fields |journal=Physica |volume=7| page=449| year=1940|doi=10.1016/S0031-8914(40)90091-X|bibcode=1940Phy.....7..449B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rosenfeld"&gt;{{cite journal|author=L. Rosenfeld |title=Sur le tenseur D’Impulsion-Energie |journal=Acad. Roy. Belg. Memoirs de classes de Science |volume=18 |issue =fasc. 6|year=1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a modification of the energy momentum tensor

: &lt;math&gt;T_B^{\mu\nu} = T^{\mu\nu} +\frac 12 \partial_\lambda(S^{\mu\nu\lambda}+S^{\nu\mu\lambda}-S^{\lambda\nu\mu})&lt;/math&gt;

that is constructed from the canonical energy momentum tensor and the spin current &lt;math&gt; {S^{\mu}}_{\nu\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; so as to be  symmetric yet still conserved.
  
An integration by parts shows that

: &lt;math&gt;M^{\nu\lambda} = \int (x^\nu T^{0\lambda}_B - x^\lambda T^{0\nu}_B) \, \mathrm{d}^3x,&lt;/math&gt;

and so a physical interpretation of Belinfante tensor is that it includes the "bound momentum" associated with gradients of the intrinsic angular momentum. In other words, the added term is an analogue of the &lt;math&gt; {\mathbf J}_\text{bound}= \nabla\times \mathbf {M}&lt;/math&gt; "[[bound current]]" associated with a magnetization density &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf M}&lt;/math&gt;.

The curious combination of spin-current components required to make &lt;math&gt; T_B^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; symmetric and yet still conserved seems totally ''ad hoc'', but it was shown by both Rosenfeld and Belinfante that the modified  tensor  is precisely the symmetric Hilbert energy–momentum tensor that acts as the source of gravity in  [[general relativity]].  Just as it is the sum of the   bound and free currents that acts as  a source of the  magnetic field, it is the sum of the bound and free energy–momentum that acts as a source of gravity.

==Belinfante-Rosenfeld and  the Hilbert energy-momentum tensor==

The Hilbert   energy-momentum tensor &lt;math&gt;T_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the variation of the action functional &lt;math&gt;S_{\rm eff}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the metric as

&lt;math&gt;\delta S_{\rm eff}=\frac 12 \int d^nx \sqrt{g} \,T_{\mu\nu}\,\delta g^{\mu\nu},&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently as

&lt;math&gt;\delta S_{\rm eff}=-\frac 12 \int d^nx \sqrt{g} \,T^{\mu\nu}\,\delta g_{\mu\nu}. &lt;/math&gt;

(The minus sign in the second equation arises because &lt;math&gt; \delta g^{\mu\nu}= - g^{\mu\sigma} \delta g_{\sigma\tau} g^{\tau\nu}&lt;/math&gt;.)

We  may  also  define  an energy-momentum  tensor &lt;math&gt;T_{cb}&lt;/math&gt; by varying a Minkowski-orthonormal  vierbein &lt;math&gt; {\bf e}_a&lt;/math&gt; to get

&lt;math&gt; \delta S_{\rm eff}=  \int d^nx\sqrt{g}\left( \frac{\delta S}{\delta e^\mu_a}\right) \delta e^\mu_a  \equiv  \int d^nx\sqrt{g} \left(T_{cb} \eta^{ca} e^{*b}_\mu\right) \delta e^\mu_a.&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt; \eta_{ab} = {\bf e}_a \cdot {\bf e}_b &lt;/math&gt; is the Minkowski metric for the orthonormal vierbein frame, and &lt;math&gt;{\bf e}^{*b}&lt;/math&gt; are the covectors dual to the vierbeins.

With the vierbein variation  there is no immediately obvious  reason for &lt;math&gt;T_{cb}&lt;/math&gt; to be symmetric. 
However, the  action functional &lt;math&gt; S_{\rm eff}({\bf e}_a) &lt;/math&gt; should be invariant under  an infinitesimal  local Lorentz transformation  &lt;math&gt;\delta e^\mu_a= e^\mu_b {\theta^{b}}_a(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta^{ab}=-\theta^{ba}&lt;/math&gt;,
and so

&lt;math&gt;\delta S_{\rm eff}
=   \int d^nx\sqrt{g} \,T_{cb}\,\eta^{ca} e^{*b}_\mu e^\mu_d {\theta^d}_a
=  \int d^nx\sqrt{g} \,T_{cb}\,\eta^{ca}  {\theta^b}_a
=  \int d^nx\sqrt{g}\, T_{cb}\, \theta^{bc}(x),
&lt;/math&gt;

should be zero.
As  &lt;math&gt;\theta^{bc}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary position-dependent skew symmetric matrix, we see that local Lorentz and rotation invariance both  requires and implies that  &lt;math&gt;T_{bc}=T_{cb}&lt;/math&gt;.

Once we know that &lt;math&gt;T_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is symmetric, it is easy to show that &lt;math&gt;T_{ab}= e_a^\mu e_b^\nu T_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;, and so the vierbein-variation energy-momentum  tensor is equivalent to  the metric-variation Hilbert  tensor.

We can now understand  the origin of the Belinfante-Rosefeld modification of the Noether canonical energy momentum tensor. 
Take the  action to be  &lt;math&gt;S_{\rm eff}({\bf e}_a, {\omega}^{ab}_\mu )&lt;/math&gt; where   &lt;math&gt;{\omega}^{ab}_\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the spin connection that   is   determined by &lt;math&gt;{\bf e}_a&lt;/math&gt;   via    the condition of being metric compatible  and torsion free.   The spin current   &lt;math&gt;{S^\mu}_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;  is then   defined by the variation

&lt;math&gt;
{S^\mu}_{ab}= \frac{2}{\sqrt g} \left(\frac{\delta S_{\rm eff}}{\delta \omega^{ab}_\mu}\right)_{{\bf e}_a},
&lt;/math&gt;

and the "canonical"  Noether energy momentum tensor &lt;math&gt;T^{(0)}_{cb}&lt;/math&gt;  is the part that arises from the variation where we keep the spin connection fixed:

&lt;math&gt;
 T_{cb} ^{(0)}  \eta^{ca} e^{*b}_\mu= \frac{1}{\sqrt{g}}\left(\frac{\delta S_{\rm eff}}{\delta e^\mu_a}\right)_{\omega^{ab}_\mu}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Then

&lt;math&gt;
\delta S_{\rm eff} = \int d^nx \sqrt{g} \left\{ T_{cb} ^{(0)}  \eta^{ca} e^{*b}_\mu  \delta e^\mu_a+ \frac 12 {S^{\mu}}_{ab} \delta {\omega^{ab}}_\mu\right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Now, for a torsion-free and metric-compatible connection, we have
that

&lt;math&gt;
(\delta \omega_{ij\mu}) e^\mu_k 
=-\frac 12\left\{(\nabla_j \delta e_{ik} -  \nabla_k  \delta e_{ij})
+( \nabla_k \delta e_{ji}- \nabla_i  \delta e_{jk}) -( \nabla_i \delta e_{kj}-\nabla_j \delta e_{ki})\right\},
&lt;/math&gt;

where we are using the notation

&lt;math&gt;
\delta e_{ij} =  {\bf e}_i\cdot \delta {\bf e}_j= \eta_{ib}[e^{*b}_\alpha \delta e_j^\alpha].
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the spin-connection variation, and after an integration by parts, we find

&lt;math&gt;
\delta S_{\rm eff} = \int d^nx \sqrt{g} \left\{ T_{cb} ^{(0)} +\frac 12 \nabla_a({S_{bc}}^a+{S_{cb}}^a-{S^a}_{bc})\right\}  \eta^{cd}e^{*b}_\mu \,\delta e_d^\mu.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus we see that  corrections to the canonical Noether tensor that appear in the  Belinfante-Rosenfeld tensor occur because we need to simultaneously vary the vierbein and the spin connection if we are to preserve local Lorentz invariance.

As an example,  consider the  classical Lagrangian for the Dirac field

&lt;math&gt;
\int d^dx\sqrt{g}\left\{ \frac i 2 \left( \bar \Psi \gamma^a e^\mu_a\nabla_\mu \Psi - (\nabla_\mu \bar\Psi)e^\mu_a \gamma_a \Psi\right)+m\bar\Psi\Psi \right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Here the spinor covariant derivatives are

&lt;math&gt;
\nabla_\mu \Psi =\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu}+\frac 18 [\gamma_b,\gamma_c] {\omega^{bc}}_\mu\right) \Psi,
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\nabla_\mu\bar  \Psi =\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu}-\frac 18 [\gamma_b,\gamma_c] {\omega^{bc}}_\mu\right) \bar\Psi.
&lt;/math&gt;

We therefore get

&lt;math&gt;
T^{(0)}_{bc}= \frac i2\left(\bar \Psi \gamma_c( \nabla_b\Psi) -(\nabla_b \bar \Psi)\gamma_c \Psi\right),
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
{S^a}_{bc}= \frac i8 \bar\Psi\{\gamma^a,[\gamma_b,\gamma_c]\}\Psi.
&lt;/math&gt;

There is no contribution from &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{g}&lt;/math&gt; if we use the equations of motion.

Now  
&lt;math&gt;
\{\gamma_a,[\gamma_b,\gamma_c]\}=4 \gamma_a\gamma_b\gamma_c, 
&lt;/math&gt;
if &lt;math&gt;a,b c&lt;/math&gt; are distinct 
and zero otherwise.
As a consequence  &lt;math&gt;S_{abc}&lt;/math&gt;  is totally antisymmetric. Now,  using this result, and again  the equations of motion, we find that

&lt;math&gt;
\nabla_a {S^a}_{bc}= T^{(0)}_{cb}-T^{(0)}_{bc},
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus  the Belinfante-Rosenfeld  tensor becomes

&lt;math&gt;
T_{bc} = T^{(0)}_{bc}+ \frac 12(T^{(0)}_{cb}-T^{(0)}_{bc})
= \frac 12 (T^{(0)}_{bc}+T^{(0)}_{cb}).
&lt;/math&gt;

The on-shell Belinfante-Rosenfeld  tensor for the Dirac field is  therefore seen to be  the symmetrized canonical energy-momentum tensor.

==Weinberg's definition==

Weinberg defines the Belinfante tensor as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weinberg|first1=Steven|title=The quantum theory of fields|date=2005|publisher=[[Cambridge Univ. Press]]|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=9780521670531|edition=Repr., pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T_B^{\mu\nu}=T^{\mu\nu}-\frac{i}{2}\partial_\kappa \left[\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\kappa\Psi^\ell)}(\mathcal{J}^{\mu\nu})^\ell_{\,\, m}\Psi^m-\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu\Psi^\ell)}(\mathcal{J}^{\kappa\nu})^\ell_{\,\, m}\Psi^m-\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\nu\Psi^\ell)}(\mathcal{J}^{\kappa\mu})^\ell_{\,\, m}\Psi^m\right]    &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lagrangian density]], the set {Ψ} are the fields appearing in the Lagrangian, the non-Belinfante energy momentum tensor is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\mu\nu}=\eta^{\mu\nu}\mathcal{L}-\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu\Psi^\ell)}\partial^\nu\Psi^\ell&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{J^{\mu\nu}}&lt;/math&gt; are a set of matrices satisfying the algebra of the homogeneous [[Lorentz group]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cahill|first1=Kevin, [[University of New Mexico]]|title=Physical mathematics|date=2013|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge|isbn=9781107005211|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[\mathcal{J}^{\mu\nu},\mathcal{J}^{\rho\sigma}]=i\mathcal{J}^{\rho\nu}\eta^{\mu\sigma}-i\mathcal{J}^{\sigma\nu}\eta^{\mu\rho}-i\mathcal{J}^{\mu\sigma}\eta^{\nu\rho}+i\mathcal{J}^{\mu\rho}\eta^{\nu\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:A calm by James Gillray.jpg|thumb|right|''A Calm'', by [[James Gillray]]]]
[[File:Abbot of Watkungtaphao in Phu Soidao Waterfall.jpg|thumb|200px|Doing [[meditation]] could help people be in a calm state.]]
'''Calmness''' is the mental state of [[Inner peace|peace of mind]] being free from agitation, excitement, or disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/calmness|title=Calm – Definition of Calm by Merriam-Webster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also refers being in a state of serenity, tranquillity, or peace.&lt;ref name="a1" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Calmness|title=Calmness – definition of calmness by The Free Dictionary|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calmness can most easily occur for the average person during a state of relaxation, but it can also be found during much more alert and aware states.{{CN|date=December 2017}} Some people find that focusing the mind on something external, or even internal, such as the breathing, can itself be very calming.

Calmness is a quality that can be cultivated and increased with practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simoleonsense.com/the-psychology-of-cool-calm-collected/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513144845/http://www.simoleonsense.com/the-psychology-of-cool-calm-collected/ |archivedate=May 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It usually takes a trained mind to stay calm in the face of a great deal of different stimulation, and possible distractions, especially emotional ones. The negative emotions are the greatest challenge to someone who is attempting to cultivate a calm mind. Some disciplines that promote and develop calmness are [[prayer]], [[yoga]], [[relaxation training]], breath training, and [[meditation]]. [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] states that “Concentration is a cornerstone of mindfulness practice. Your mindfulness will only be as robust as the capacity of your mind to be calm and stable. Without calmness, the mirror of mindfulness will have an agitated and choppy surface and will not be able to reflect things with any accuracy.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/calmness|title=Quotes About Calmness|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another term usually associated with calmness is "Peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/calmness?show=0&amp;t=1303344553|title=Calmness Synonyms, Calmness Antonyms – Merriam-Webster Thesaurus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mind that is at peace or calm will cause the brain to produce "good" hormones, which in turn give the person a stable emotional state and promote good health in every area of life, including [[marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=98658&amp;page=2|title=Study: Bad Hormones Lead to Bad Marriages|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing the rise in crime and diseases around the world which are more often than not the consequences of the emotions going 'out-of-control',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/topics/anger/control.aspx#|title=Controlling Anger — Before It Controls You|work=apa.org|accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is therefore considered beneficial for many to stay calm and cultivate it in every possible situation, especially during stressful events such as demise of a family member or failure in business.

==Etymology==
The term comes from [[Middle English]] calme, from [[Old French]], from [[Old Italian]] calmo, from [[Late Latin]] cauma, "heat of the day", the "resting place in the heat of the day", from Greek kauma, burning heat, from kaiein, to burn.&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt;

'''Chai''' ({{lang-he|[[wikt:חַי|חַי]]}} "living" ''{{transl|he|ḥay}}'') is a Hebrew word that figures prominently in modern [[Jewish culture]]; the Hebrew letters of the word are often used as a visual symbol.

==History==
According to ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'', its use as an amulet originates in 18th century Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/165445/exploring-chai-culture/?p=all|title=Exploring 'Chai' Culture|date=11 November 2012|work=The Jewish Daily Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chai as a symbol goes back to medieval Spain. Letters as symbols in [[Jewish culture]] go back to the earliest Jewish roots, the [[Talmud]] states that the world was created from Hebrew letters which form verses of the [[Torah]]. In medieval [[Kabbalah]], Chai is the lowest (closest to the physical plane) emanation of God.&lt;ref name=tco&gt;Pelaia, Ariela. "[https://www.thoughtco.com/chai-in-judaism-2076800 What Does the Chai Symbol Signify for Jews?]" ThoughtCo.  (accessed March 9, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; According to 16th century Greek rabbi [[Shlomo HaKohen of Greece|Shlomo Hacohen Soloniki]], in his commentary on the [[Zohar]], Chai as a symbol has its linkage in the Kabbalah texts to God's attribute of 'Ratzon', or motivation, will, muse.&lt;ref&gt;Sheat Ratzon al ha-Zohar 35&lt;/ref&gt;  The Jewish commentaries give an especially long treatment to certain verses in the Torah with the word as their central theme. Three examples are Leviticus 18:5 וָחַי בָּהֶם 'Chai Bahem', 'and you shall live by [this faith]' (as opposed to just doing it), this is part of the section dealing with the legacy of Moses Our Teacher following his death. Deuteronomy 30:רְאֵה נָתַתִּי לְפָנֶיךָ הַיּוֹם, אֶת-הַחַיִּים וְאֶת-הַטּוֹב, וְאֶת-הַמָּוֶת, וְאֶת-הָרָע.	15 "Verily, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil, in that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His ordinances; then thou shalt live." There is nary an ancient Jewish commentator who does not comment on that verse. The [[Shema]] prayer as well speaks of the importance of Chai, to live and walk in the Jewish cultural lifestyle.

Two common Jewish names used since Talmudic times, are based on this symbol, Chaya feminine, Chayim masculine.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The Jewish toast (on alcoholic beverages such as wine) is l'chaim, 'to life'.&lt;ref name=tco/&gt;

==Linguistics==
The word is made up of two letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]] - [[Heth (letter)|Chet]] ({{Hebrew|ח}}) and [[Yodh|Yod]] ({{Hebrew|י}}), forming the word "chai", meaning "alive", or "living".&lt;ref name=tco/&gt; The most common spelling in [[Latin script]] is "Chai", but the word is occasionally also spelled "Hai". The usual modern pronunciation of this word is {{IPA-he|χai̯|}}, while a transcription of the [[Biblical Hebrew language|Biblical]] and [[Mishnaic Hebrew language|Mishnaic]] pronunciation would have likely been {{IPA|[ħai̯]}} (with a [[pharyngeal consonant]]).

In Hebrew, the related word ''chaya'' means "living thing" or "animal", and is derived from the Hebrew word ''chai'' ({{lang|he|חי}}), meaning "life".

==Numerology==
There have been various mystical numerological speculations about the fact that, according to the system of [[gematria]], the letters of ''chai'' add up to 18&lt;ref name=tco/&gt; (see [[Tzadikim Nistarim#Lamedvavnik/s|"Lamedvavniks"]] etc.).  For this reason, [[18 (number)|18]] is a spiritual number in Judaism, and many Jews give gifts of money in multiples of 18 as a result.&lt;ref name=tco/&gt;

==In Jewish culture==
[[Image:מדליות במכביה ה-18, 1.JPG|thumb|[[Maccabiah Games|Maccabia]] medals with ''Chai'' symbol]]

The Chai symbol can be worn by Jews as a medallion around the neck, similarly to other Jewish symbols, such as the [[Star of David]] and the [[Hamsa]].&lt;ref name=tco/&gt;

Jews often give gifts and donations in multiples of 18, which is called "giving chai".  Mailings from Jewish charities usually suggest the amounts to give in multiples of chai (18, 36, 54 dollars, etc.) rather than the usual multiples of 25.&lt;ref name=tco/&gt;

It appears in the slogan "''{{transl|he|[[Am Yisrael Chai|ʿam yisraʾel ḥay]]}}!''" ({{Hebrew|עַם יִשְרָאֵל חַי}}, "The people of Israel lives!").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Am Yisrael Chai" - Eternal Nation|url=http://www.aish.com/sh/s/48967201.html|website=aish.com|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is heard in a [https://web.archive.org/web/20140729011002/http://soundportraits.org/on-air/bergen-belsen/transcript.php BBC recording] from April 20, 1945 of Jewish survivors of the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] five days after their liberation. This was the first Sabbath ceremony openly conducted on German soil since the beginning of the war. With people still dying around them, the survivors sang what would become the Israeli national anthem, "[[Hatikvah]]". At the end of "Hatikvah", British Army Chaplain [[Leslie Hardman]] shouts out, ''Am Yisrael Chai!'' ("The people of Israel is alive!")&lt;ref&gt;[http://israblog.nana.co.il/blogread.asp?blog=213241&amp;blogcode=3921211 Nana.co.il] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520091127/http://israblog.nana.co.il/blogread.asp?blog=213241&amp;blogcode=3921211 |date=May 20, 2007 }}, original Site with Newspaper Article {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1983]], which was held in Germany four decades after [[Shoah]], Israel was represented with the song "[[Hi (Ofra Haza song)|Chai]]", performed by [[Ofra Haza]], which includes the line ''Am Yisra'el chai''.

Several Jewish radio stations have the word in their names, including [[Kol Chai]] (Israel), [[Radio Jai]] (Argentina), and [[ChaiFM]] (South Africa).

'''Child abduction''' or '''child theft''' is the unauthorized removal of a [[Minor (law)|minor]] (a child under the age of [[Age of majority|legal adulthood]]) from the [[Child custody|custody]] of the child's [[Parent|natural parents]] or [[Legal guardian|legally appointed guardians]].
 
The term child abduction conflates two legal and social categories which differ by their perpetrating contexts: abduction by members of the child's family or abduction by strangers:

* [[Parental child abduction]]: unauthorized custody of a child by a family relative (usually one or both parents) without parental agreement and contrary to family law ruling, which may have removed the child from the care, access and contact of the other parent and family side. Occurring around parental [[Legal separation|separation]] or [[divorce]], such parental or familial child abduction may include [[parental alienation]], a form of child abuse seeking to disconnect a child from targeted parent and denigrated side of [[family]].
* [[Kidnapping|Abduction or kidnapping]] by strangers (from outside the family, natural or legal guardians) who steal  a child for criminal purposes which may include:
** [[extortion]], to elicit a [[ransom]] from the guardians for the child's return
** illegal [[adoption]], a stranger steals a child with the intent to rear the child as their own or to sell to a prospective adoptive parent
** [[human trafficking]], a stranger steals a child with the intent to exploit the child themselves or by trade in a list of possible abuses including [[child slavery|slavery]], [[child labor|forced labor]], [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]], or even [[Organ trade#Illegal organ trading|illegal organ trading]]
** [[murder]]

Neonatal "infant abduction" and prenatal [[fetal abduction]] are the earliest ages of child abduction as defined by a viable child through the age of majority. In addition, "embryo theft" and even "oocyte misappropriation" in reproductive medical settings have been legalistically construed as child abduction.&lt;ref name="pmid9242390"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Lehrman S| title=University settles with patients over trade in 'stolen' embryos. | journal=Nature | year= 1997 | volume= 388 | issue= 6641 | pages= 411 | pmid=9242390 | doi=10.1038/41181 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=9242390  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Judith D.|title=Misappropriation of Human Eggs and Embryos and the Tort of Conversion: A Relational View|journal=Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review|date=1999|volume=32|issue=381|url=http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/llr/vol32/iss2/2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=Karen T.|title=Embryo Theft: The Misappropriation of Human Eggs at an Irvine Fertility Clinic Has Raised a Host of New Legal Concerns for Infertile Couples Using New Reproductive Technologies|journal=Southwestern University Law Review|date=1997|volume=26|issue=1133|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/swulr26&amp;div=31&amp;id=&amp;page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abductions by strangers ==
The stereotypical version of child abduction by a stranger is the classic form of "[[kidnapping]]," exemplified by the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]], in which the child is detained, transported some distance, held for ransom or with intent to keep the child permanently. These instances are rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/documents/nismart2_nonfamily.pdf |title=NISMART National Non-Family Abduction Report October 2002 (A study commissioned by the US Department of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention found that there were only approximately 115 stereotypical stranger abductions in 1999) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child abduction for ransom: United States ===
[[File:2007 report child plane.jpg|thumb|left|Image from the [[United States Hague Abduction Convention Compliance Reports]] on the [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]]]]

The earliest nationally publicised kidnapping of a child by a stranger for the purpose of extracting a ransom payment from the parents was the Pool case of 1819, which took place in Baltimore, Maryland. Margaret Pool, 20-months-old, was kidnapped on May 20 by Nancy Gamble (19-years-old) and secreted with the assistance of Marie Thomas. On May 22, the parents, James and Mary Pool, placed an ad in the ''Baltimore Patriot'' newspaper offering a $20 reward for Mary's return. When the child was recovered on May 23—through the efforts of members of the community who conducted a search—it was revealed that the child had been badly whipped by Gamble and bore bloody wounds. Both Gamble and Thomas were tried for the crime of kidnapping and found guilty. The motive for the crime was demonstrated to be financial. She had kidnapped the child with the intention of waiting for a reward to be offered, then would return the child and collect the money. This is a technique favored by many ransom child kidnappers before the use of written ransom demands became the favored method.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Nancy Gamble's crime and subsequent trial were reported in detail in ''Baltimore Patriot'' (June 26, 1819). The June 26 article, as well as others on the case that had appeared in the ''Patriot'', were reprinted in newspapers in other states including: Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia and Washington D.C.

=== Children abducted for slavery ===
{{Main|Child slavery}}
In 1597, [[Elizabeth I of England]] licensed the abduction of children for use as chapel choristers and theatre performers.&lt;ref name=bbc130617&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-22938866 | title = Elizabethan child actors 'kidnapped and whipped' | first = Sean | last = Coughlan | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 17 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are reports that abduction of children to be used or sold as [[slavery|slaves]] is common in parts of Africa.

The [[Lord's Resistance Army]], a rebel paramilitary group operating mainly in northern [[Uganda]], is notorious for its abductions of children for use as [[child soldier]]s or [[sex slave]]s. According to the [[Sudan Tribune]], {{as of|2005|lc=y}}, more than 30,000 children have been kidnapped by the LRA and their leader, Joseph Kony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/article.php3?id_article=11792 |title=Time may be running out for Uganda's LRA warlord – Sudan Tribune: Plural news and views on Sudan |publisher=Sudan Tribune |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By stranger to raise ===
A very small number of abductions result from - in most cases - women who kidnap babies (or other young children) to bring up as their own. These women are often unable to have children of their own, or have [[Miscarriage|miscarried]], and seek to satisfy their unmet psychological need by abducting a child rather than by [[adoption|adopting]]. The crime is often premeditated, with the woman often [[simulated pregnancy|simulating pregnancy]] to reduce suspicion when a baby suddenly appears in the household.

Historically, a few states have practiced child abduction for [[indoctrination]], as a form of punishment for political opponents, or for profit. Notable cases include the [[kidnapping of children by Nazi Germany]] (400,000 children kidnapped for possible [[Germanization]]),&lt;ref name=Sereny&gt;[[Gitta Sereny]], [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/children.html "Stolen Children"], rpt. in ''[[Jewish Virtual Library]]'' ([[American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise]]). Accessed September 15, 2008.

Some other abductions have been to make children available by [[child-selling]] for adoption by other people,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/china/21570762-curb-widespread-trafficking-abducted-children-officials-and-parents-are-turning-social ''Child Trafficking: A Cruel Trade'', in ''The Economist'', January 26, 2013], as accessed July 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; without adopting parents necessarily being aware of how children were actually made available for adoption.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, Barbara Bisantz, ''The Baby Thief: The Untold Story of Georgia Tann, the Baby Seller Who Corrupted Adoption'' (New York: Union Square Press, 1st ed. 2007 ({{ISBN|978-1-4027-5863-8}})), p.&amp;nbsp;245.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parental child abduction ==
{{Main|Parental child abduction}}
By far the most common kind of child abduction is parental child abduction (200,000 in 2010 alone)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maureen|first=Dabbagh|title=Parental Kidnapping in America|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|location=US|isbn=978-0-7864-6533-0|page=1|url=http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6533-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and often occurs when the parents separate or begin divorce proceedings. A parent may remove or retain the child from the other seeking to gain an advantage in expected or pending child-custody proceedings or because that parent fears losing the child in those expected or pending child-custody proceedings; a parent may refuse to return a child at the end of an ''[[contact (law)|access]] visit'' or may flee with the child to prevent an access visit or fear of domestic violence and abuse.

Parental child abductions may be within the same city, within the state region or within the same country, or may be international. Studies performed for the [[U.S. Department of Justice]]'s [[Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention]] reported that in 1999, 53% percent of family abducted children were gone less than one week, and 21% were gone one month or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/documents/nismart2_familyabduction.pdf |title=NISMART National Family Abduction Report, October 2002 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International child abduction ===
{{Main|International child abduction}}

International child abduction occurs when a parent, relative or acquaintance of a child leaves the country with the child or children in violation of a custody decree or visitation order. Another related situation is retention where children are taken on an alleged vacation to a foreign country and are not returned.

While the number of cases which is over 600,000 a year consists of international child abduction is small in comparison to domestic cases, they are often the most difficult to resolve due to the involvement of conflicting international jurisdictions.  Two-thirds of international parental abduction cases involve mothers who often allege domestic violence. Even when there is a treaty agreement for the return of a child, the court may be reluctant to return the child if the return could result in the permanent separation of the child from their primary caregiver. This could occur if the abducting parent faced criminal prosecution or deportation by returning to the child's home country.

The [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]] is an international human rights treaty and legal mechanism to recover children abducted to another country. The Hague Convention does not provide relief in many cases resulting in some parents hiring private parties to recover their children. Covert recovery was first made public when Don Feeney, a former Delta Commando, responded to a desperate mother's plea to locate and recover her daughter from Jordan in the 1980s. Feeney successfully located and returned the child. A movie and book about Feeney's exploits lead to other desperate parents seeking him out for recovery services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;#8250 Donya Al-Nahi |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0671769340 |title=Rescue My Child: The Story of the Ex-Delta Commandos Who Bring Home Children Abducted Overseas: Neil C. Livingstone: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2007, both the United States, European authorities, and NGO's had begun serious interest in the use of mediation as a means by which some international child abduction cases may be resolved. The primary focus was on Hague Cases. Development of mediation in Hague cases, suitable for such an approach, had been tested and reported by REUNITE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reunite.org/ |title=Reunite International |publisher=Reunite.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; a London Based NGO which provides support in international child abduction cases, as successful. Their reported success lead to the first international training for cross-border mediation in 2008, sponsored by NCMEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingkids.com |title=National Center for Missing and Exploited Children |publisher=Missingkids.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Held at the University of Miami School of Law, Lawyers, Judges, and certified mediators interested in international child abduction cases, attended.

International child abduction is not new. A case of international child abduction has been documented aboard the Titanic. However, the incidence of international child abduction continues to increase due to the ease of international travel, increase in bi-cultural marriages and a high divorce rate. Parental abduction has been defined as child abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prevent-abuse-now.com/unreport.htm |title=Parental Child Abduction is Child Abuse |first=Dr. Nancy |last=Faulkner |publisher=Prevent-abuse-now.com |date=June 9, 1999 |accessdate=September 9, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926135211/http://www.prevent-abuse-now.com/unreport.htm |archivedate=September 26, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global Missing Children's Network==
Launched in 1998 as a [[joint venture]] of the [[International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]] (ICMEC) and NCMEC, the Global Missing Children's Network (GMCN) is a network of countries that connect, share [[best practices]], and disseminate information and images of missing children to improve the effectiveness of missing children investigations.&lt;ref name=ncmissing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingkids.com/GMCN|title=Global Missing Children's Network|publisher=NCMEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cyber&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0rVfRwcIPYgC&amp;pg=SA11-PA31&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBg&amp;q=icmec%20children|title=Computer Forensics: Investigating Network Intrusions and Cyber Crime|author= EC-Council|publisher= Cengage Learning|pages=11–26, 11–31 to 11–33|year= 2009|ISBN=1435483529}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=more/&gt;  The Network has 22 member countries: Albania, Argentina, Australia, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the US.&lt;ref name=more&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/activities-in-more-than-22-countries-around-the-globe-will-remember-missing-children-on-may-25-2013-05-22|title=Activities in More than 22 Countries around the Globe will Remember Missing Children on May 25|date=May 22, 2013|work=MarketWatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parents of [[Madeleine McCann]], a three-year-old girl who disappeared from her bed in a hotel in Portugal in 2007, approached ICMEC to help them publicize her case. ICMEC's YouTube channel, "Don'tYouForgetAboutMe," which lets people post videos, images, and information about their missing children, was launched that year as a part of these efforts, and {{as of|2014|November|lc=y}} had 2,200 members.&lt;ref name=peo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20051149,00.html|title=Madeleine McCann's Parents Create Missing Kids Site on Youtube|work=People|author=Ellen Tumposky|date=August 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/DontYouForgetAboutMe|title=DontYouForgetAboutMe|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/10/ukcrime.madeleinemccann|title=You have to blank out the dark thoughts|newspaper= ''The Guardian''|date=August 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ICMEC reviews the postings to ensure that any child in a posted video is in fact missing, that authorities are aware that the child is missing, and that the images are not inappropriate.&lt;ref name=peo/&gt;

'''Dance notation''' is the [[symbol]]ic representation of human [[dance]] movement and form, using methods such as graphic symbols and figures, path mapping, [[Numeral system|numerical system]]s, and letter and word [[Writing systems|notations]]. Several dance notation systems have been invented, many of which are designed to document specific types of dance. A ''dance score'' is recorded dance notation that describes a particular dance.

==Usage==

The primary uses of dance notation are historical dance preservation through documentation, and analysis (e.g., in [[ethnochoreology]]) or reconstruction of [[choreography]], dance forms, and technical exercises. Also, dance notation allows a dance work to be documented and therefore potentially copyrighted. 

Two popular dance notation systems used in [[Western culture]] are [[Labanotation]] (also known as Kinetography Laban) and [[Benesh Movement Notation]]. Others include [[Eshkol-Wachman Movement Notation]] and DanceWriting.

Many dance notation systems are designed for a specific type of dance. Examples of such systems include Shorthand Dance Notation for dances from [[Israel]], Morris Dance Notation for [[Morris dance]], and [[Beauchamp-Feuillet notation]] for [[Baroque dance]]. As a result, these systems usually cannot effectively describe other types of dance.

==History==

[[File:Dancewriting 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Valerie Sutton]] in a dance pose and its corresponding "Sutton DanceWriting" notation.]]

In the 1680s, [[Pierre Beauchamp]] invented a dance notation system for Baroque dance. His system, known as ''[[Beauchamp-Feuillet notation]]'', was published in 1700 by [[Raoul-Auger Feuillet]] and used to record dances throughout the eighteenth century.

A well-known collection of dance scores is the [[Sergeyev Collection]], recorded using [[Vladimir Ivanovich Stepanov]]'s notation method (1892). This collection documents the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]]'s (today the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet) repertoire from the turn of the 20th century, including [[Marius Petipa]]'s original choreographic designs for ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', ''[[Giselle]]'', ''[[Le Corsaire]]'', and ''[[Swan Lake]]'', as well as ''[[Coppélia]]'' and the original version of ''[[The Nutcracker]]''. It was with this collection that many of these works were first staged outside Russia.

In 1948, [[Hanya Holm]] became the first Broadway choreographer to have her dance scores copyrighted, for her work on ''[[Kiss Me, Kate|Kiss Me Kate]]''.

In 1951, Stanley D. Kahn published [[Kahnotation]], a dance notation system specific to [[tap dance]].

In 1975, [[Ann Hutchinson Guest]] reconstructed choreographer [[Arthur Saint-Léon]]'s ''Pas de Six'' from his 1844 ballet ''[[La Vivandière]]'', along with its original music by composer [[Cesare Pugni]], for the [[Joffrey Ballet]]. The piece was reconstructed from Saint-Léon's work, which was documented using his own method of dance notation, known as ''La Sténochorégraphie''.

In 1982, the first computerized notation system—the ''DOM'' dance notation system—was created by [[Eddie Dombrower]] for the [[Apple II]] [[personal computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Dance Notation Journal|year=1986|issue=Fall|pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system displayed an animated figure on the screen that performed dance moves specified by the choreographer.

'''Daniel A. Vallero''' is an American environmental author&lt;ref&gt;[http://store.elsevier.com/Daniel-Vallero/ELS_1007685/ Author page at Elsevier]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470259603.fmatter/summary/ Author page at John Wiley &amp; Sons]&lt;/ref&gt; and scientist. He was born in [[East St. Louis, Illinois]] and grew up in [[Collinsville, Illinois]]. He received a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in city and regional planning from [[Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville]].  He also earned a masters in civil and environmental engineering (environmental health sciences) from the [[University of Kansas]] and a PhD in civil and environmental engineering from [[Duke University]] with a thesis on "“Dicarboximide Fungicide Flux to the Lower Troposphere from an Aquic Hapludult Soil”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cee.duke.edu/faculty/daniel-vallero Faculty page at Duke]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fds.duke.edu/db/pratt/cee/faculty/daniel.vallero/files/CV.pdf Curriculum vitae at Duke]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Vallero is recognized internationally for advancing the state of environmental science and engineering, as an author, educator, engineer and scientific researcher. He has appeared on news and other shows, recently discussing [[plastic recycling]] on NBC's [[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]] (http://www.today.com/video/today/51620316) and on [[MSNBC]], and current state of ethics in research at universities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-engineering-schools/articles/2012/05/31/ethics-courses-trending-at-graduate-engineering-schools?page=2 U.S. News &amp; World Report]&lt;/ref&gt; He began his professional career in the Kansas City regional office of the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] in 1976 and has worked in numerous other scientific venues since then.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-05/documents/vallero_daniel_sed.pdf Researcher page at EPA]&lt;/ref&gt; He directed the Science, Technology and Human Values Program at [[Duke University]] from 1997 to 2005. Beginning in 2005, he has been  adjunct Professor of  Engineering Ethics at  Duke University, with a joint appointment in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and  the Trinity School of Arts and Sciences. He held appointments also at the [[University of Missouri-Kansas City]], [[North Carolina Central University]], and as science staff member on Energy and Power Subcommittee of the [[United States House of Representatives]].
 
In his books and other writings, Vallero has taken the systems view of living systems, As such he has bridged [[biomedical engineering]] with [[environmental engineering]]. He stresses the need to incorporate the [[social sciences]] into every engineering and design project.  As a leader in [[engineering ethics]], he has served the [[National Academy of Engineering]] as a member of the Online Ethics Committee and the Executive Board of the National Institute of Engineering Ethics. Vallero has also advised [[Sigma Xi]], universities and other institutions on science and [[research ethics]] and the responsible conduct of research (RCR).

Vallero is editor for the [[Institution of Chemical Engineers]]' journal, ''Process Safety and Environmental Protection'', as well as the [[MDPI]] journal, ''Sustainability''. He is also the environmental engineering subject editor of the [[McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Technology]] and the ''McGraw-Hill Yearbook of Science &amp; Technology''.

== Works ==

Vallero is a pioneer of [[green engineering]] and the application of [[life cycle analysis]] to engineering design. He was among the first to question the sustainability and ethics of using corn as a source of ethanol fuel. His reasoning was that current farming practice's dependence on fossil fuels needed to grow (including fertilizer and pesticides), harvest and ferment the corn is highly inefficient thermodynamically. The use of corn for fuel is especially problematic, since only the seed are used, not to mention the misuse of an important part of the global food supply.&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008). Teaching green engineering: The case of ethanol life cycle analysis. Bulletin of
Science, Technology &amp; Society. 28 (3): 236-243.&lt;/ref&gt; Vallero argued that other crops are much more sustainable, especially those that make use of the whole plant, including cellulosic material, like [[switchgrass]] (Panicum virgatum).

In the book, "DUST: The inside Story of its Role in the September 11th Aftermath," &lt;ref&gt;P.J. Lioy (2010). DUST: The Inside Story of Its Role in the September 11th Aftermath (Forward By Tom Kean). Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield. {{ISBN|1-4422-0148-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the late American scientist [[Paul Lioy]] credited Vallero with leading the way to sampling of hazardous air pollutants in and around Ground Zero following the [[9/11]] attacks on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]. Lioy collaborated with Vallero in establishing a protocol for characterizing exposure in risk assessments following such emergencies. Lioy and Vallero coined the term “5 R’s” to delineate how exposure assessment varies during the five stages following a disaster: 1. Rescue; 2. Recovery; 3. Reentry; 4. Restoration; and 5. Rehabitation.&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero  and P. Lioy (2012). The 5-R’s: Reliable Post-Disaster Exposure Assessment. Leadership and Management and Engineering. 12 (4):  247-253. (October 2012). {{DOI|10.1061/(ASCE)LM.1943-5630.0000200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With architect, Chris Brasier, Vallero coined the term "synthovation," as a new design process for green engineering and [[green architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008), Sustainable Design: The Science of Sustainability and Green Engineering. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ, {{ISBN|0470130628}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of synthesis and innovation, sustainable design does not consider innovation to be an interruption (feedback loop) to the design process as in traditional "concept to completion" design. Rather, innovations are to be expected and integrated. Differing from the traditional step-wise process, synthovation is a spiral, dynamic, and continuously moving process toward completion of the design and throughout the life of the project, including end-of life recycling and design for disassembly, a component of [[design for environment]] (DfE), with innovations added along the way that will increase the [[sustainability]] of the project over its entire [[Enterprise life cycle|life cycle]].

In her book, "Hormone Deception",&lt;ref&gt;L. Berkson (2010), Hormone Deception. CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform; 1 edition, {{ISBN|1453741275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsey Berkson credits Vallero as among the first to apply [[exposure science]] to [[endocrine disruptors]].

'''Elizabeth Bender Roe Cloud''' (April 2, 1887 – September 16, 1965) was an [[Ojibwe]] activist and educator. A product of the Native American Boarding School System, she graduated with teaching credentials from the [[Hampton Institute]] and taught from 1908 though 1916. She then joined her husband and helped administer the American Indian Institute of Wichita, Kansas for twenty-five years. In the 1940s, she founded the Oregon Trails Women's Club with tribe members from the [[Umatilla Indian Reservation]]. She served as the National Chair of Indian Welfare for the [[General Federation of Women's Clubs]] for eight years, the first American Indian to hold the post. Roe Cloud received the National Mother of the Year award in 1950 and in 1952, she was honored as the "Outstanding Indian" of the year by the [[American Indian Exposition]] of [[Anadarko, Oklahoma]]. She is noted for having used her influence as an educated indigenous woman to advocate for Native American self-determination.

==Early life==
Elizabeth Georgiana Bender (native name: Equay Zaince){{#tag:ref|Elizabeth Roe Cloud's allotment number was 556, as shown on the 1930 Chippewa Census.{{sfn|Chippewa Census|1930|p=562}} This allotment number is identical with that assigned to Equay Zaince on the Minnesota Historical Society Records.{{sfn|Minnesota Historical Society|2011|p=12}}|group="Notes"}} was born on April 2, 1887{{#tag:ref|Tetzloff gives Bender's birth date April 2, 1887.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=80}} This conflicts with the date of July 1888 shown on the 1900 census;{{sfn|U. S. Census|1900|p=5B}} but all of the dates on the 1900 census for the Bender siblings do not conform to other published dates. For example, Anna's birth date in Molin is given as February 22, 1885{{sfn|Molin|1988|p=94}} and Chief's birth date in Kashatus is given as May 5, 1884.{{sfn|Kashatus|2006|p=5}}|group="Notes"}}  on the [[White Earth Indian Reservation]] in northwestern [[Minnesota]] to Pay show de o quay (Mary née Razor or Razier), of the Mississippi Chippewa band and Albertus Bliss Bender, a German immigrant.{{sfn|U. S. Census|1900|p=5B}}{{sfn|Chippewa Census|1896|p=197}}{{sfn|''Indianapolis Recorder''|1950|p=9}}{{sfn|Kashatus|2006|p=5}}{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=80}} Her father was a logger and after he and Mary married, he lived on her allotment, continued to log, and also hunted and fished.{{sfn|Molin|1988|p=94}} Bender's mother was an [[herbalist]] and healer, who served as a [[midwife]] to her tribe. One of eleven children born to the couple, Elizabeth was the sixth child{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=80}} and one of five who attended Hampton Institute.{{sfn|Molin|1988|p=94}} Her older sister Anna was also an educator and two of her older brothers John and [[Chief Bender|Charles Albert "Chief" Bender]] were noted baseball players. Chief was inducted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1953.{{sfn|Swift|2008|p=165}}{{sfn|Kashatus|2006|p=150}}

Bender attended boarding schools in Minnesota, beginning her studies at around age nine at the Catholic Sisters School in [[St. Joseph, Minnesota]]. After her first year, she transferred to the Catholic Sisters School closer to home, in [[White Earth, Minnesota|White Earth]], for another year. Between 1898 and 1902,{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=81}} she took courses at the [[American Indian boarding schools|Pipestone Boarding School]] for half a day and then performed manual labor for the other half-day.{{sfn|Molin|1988|p=95}} She went on to join her sister Anna and further her education at the [[normal school]] of the Hampton Institute in 1903.{{sfn|Gridley|1936|p=34}}{{sfn|Messer|2009|p=93}} Both she and her sister Anna participated in the work-away summer programs, where they were paid for performing domestic services. In 1904, they were placed in separate houses near Boston, which allowed them to spend time together, as well as making a trip to watch their brother Chief play baseball.{{sfn|Molin|1988|p=97}} Completing her studies in 1907, she remained at Hampton taking post-graduate courses in teaching and domestic science.{{sfn|Messer|2009|p=93}}{{sfn|Nesper|2014}}{{sfn|Molin|1988|p=97}}

==Career==
In 1908, Bender was sent to the [[Blackfeet Reservation]] in [[Browning, Montana]], where she would teach for two years. In 1910, she returned east and completed a nursing course in [[Philadelphia]] at [[Hahnemann University Hospital|Hahnemann Hospital]]. In 1912, she returned to the Blackfeet Reservation. The following year,{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|pp=84–85}} she moved on to the school at the [[Fort Belknap Indian Reservation]] in Montana, where she remained until 1914.{{sfn|Messer|2009|p=94}}{{sfn|''The Red Lake News''|1915|p=2}} At both of the reservations, she not only taught, but served as housemother to the boarders, occasionally as their cook, and even treated the students for [[trachoma]].{{sfn|Messer|2009|p=94}} She returned to Hampton to complete a [[Home Economics]] course in 1914 and 1915.{{sfn|Nesper|2014}}{{sfn|''The Red Lake News''|1915|p=2}} During this same time frame, she attended the Fourth Annual Conference of the [[Society of American Indians]] held between October 6 and 11, 1914 in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].{{sfn|Messer|2009|p=93}} Bender had joined the organization when she graduated{{sfn|Nesper|2014}} and it was at this meeting that she would meet [[Henry Roe Cloud]], a full-blood [[Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska|Winnebago]] tribe member.{{sfn|Messer|2009|p=93}} The two immediately began a relationship, which continued even after Bender finished her studies at Hampton and went to teach at [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] in 1915.{{sfn|Messer|2009|p=95}} Simultaneously, Roe Cloud went to [[Wichita, Kansas]] and founded the Roe Institute, later known as the American Indian Institute,{{sfn|''The Wichita Beacon''|1921|p=12}}{{sfn|Tihen|2002|pp=2–3}} a college preparatory school for indigenous men.{{sfn|Nesper|2014}} While she was at Carlisle, Bender formed a [[Camp Fire Girls]] program, to help girls learn domestic and artistic skills.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|pp=85–86}} On 12 June 1916, Bender married Roe Cloud at her brother Chief's home in Philadelphia.{{sfn|''The Native American''|1916|p=240}}

The couple made their home in Wichita, where Elizabeth worked at the American Indian Institute (AII), serving as matron and financial manager.{{sfn|Gridley|1936|p=34}} Because Henry had no prior experience teaching, she often served as an advisor and took an active part in running the school for twenty years.{{sfn|Messer|2009|pp=94, 102}}{{sfn|Nesper|2014}} Unlike other Native American schools, the  curriculum of AII included courses on indigenous cultures, in addition to the academic lessons.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=90}} Over the next several years, their family grew to include Elizabeth Marion (born 1917), Anne Woesha (born 1918), Lillian Alberta (born 1920), Ramona Clark (born 1922) and Henry Jr. (1926–1929). When Henry Jr. died, they adopted Jay Hunter, a family friend, who was not orphaned, but joined their family as was customary among the Winnebago.{{sfn|Messer|2009|p=108}} In 1931, Henry took a job with the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] and began traveling as an investigator researching conditions, such as education, health and poverty, among Native American communities.{{sfn|Messer|2009|p=107}} He was often absent from the school and Elizabeth supervised it during those absences.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=91}} In 1932, she returned to school, taking courses at [[Wichita University]] part time, where she eventually earned her bachelor's degree.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|pp=92–93}} Henry had been appointed as the superintendent of the [[Haskell Institute]] in 1933 and would work in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]] for the next two years.{{sfn|Goodwin|2017|p=69}} Elizabeth resigned from her duties at AII in 1934, but continued to live in Wichita so that the children could finish their schooling and herself took graduate courses at the [[University of Kansas]].{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|pp=92–93}} In 1937, fire destroyed the school and after struggling to remain open for two years, the decision was made to close the school in 1939.{{sfn|Tihen|2002|p=3}} That same year, Elizabeth was asked by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to serve as a delegate to represent minorities for the [[White House Conference on Children and Youth]], examining children and the role of democracy. At the conference, she met [[Sadie Orr Dunbar]], who was the current president of the [[General Federation of Women's Clubs]] (GFWC).{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|pp=94–95}}

In 1940, the family relocated to the [[Umatilla Indian Reservation]], where Henry became superintendent of the agency there.{{sfn|Goodwin|2017|p=71}}{{sfn|U. S. Census|1940|p=2B}} Elizabeth became involved in the [[Woman's club movement]], founding the Oregon Trails Women's Club from women on the reservation.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=95}} Joining the Oregon State Federation of Women's Clubs, she was appointed to serve as chair for the state organization's Indian Welfare Committee{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=78}} in 1948. Her duties were to implement the club's outreach to Native American women and to help the club members implement the goals of equal citizenship for indigenous people.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=97}} Henry died of heart failure in 1950, before Elizabeth won the Golden Rule Foundation's Mother of the Year award for 1950.{{sfn|''Indianapolis Recorder''|1950|p=9}} In part, the award was given because all four of her daughters had gone on to earn university educations. Marion had been the first American Indian to graduate from [[Wellesley College]], Anne Woesha was the first indigenous woman to graduate from [[Vassar College|Vassar]], Lillian completed her education at the University of Kansas and Ramona graduated from Vassar.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=97}} The award propelled her to national speaking and writing engagements and to head the national Indian Affairs Division for the GFWC.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=99}} She was the first Native American to be named mother of the year, as well as the first to head the GFWC's Indian Affairs Division,{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|pp=97, 99}} which she led for eight years. Developing a "Point Four Program", which included desegregating Indian populations from mainstream schools and opportunities, providing leadership training, expanding cultural programs, and conducting studies.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=100}} She urged each affiliated club to develop Indian Affairs committees   and by 1951 had offices in forty state affiliates. She also pressed for state organizations to offer educational scholarships for Native children.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=104}} In regard to the last item, Roe Cloud traveled over 22,000 miles over the next two years assessing conditions for tribes in twenty-two states and the [[Territory of Alaska]].{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=100}} Simultaneously, she began participating as a field officer of the [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI). She had directed a two-week summer stragegy workshop, held in [[Brigham City, Utah]] in 1951 and began working as a co-director, with [[D'Arcy McNickle]] for the American Indian Development Project.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=101}}

Roe Cloud used her voice as an advocate for indigenous people, arguing that though Native Americans could learn self-sufficiency, the government had to cease efforts to victimize tribes by usurping their power, their natural resources, and their customs. She proposed a Charter of Indian Rights, developed in the AID Project to the GFWC, which was adopted in 1952. In part, the plan called for the government to speed up its efforts to help tribes eliminate poverty and illiteracy, provide adequate health and resource safeguards, and allow Native communities the autonomy to manage their own affairs once they had shown an ability to do so.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=102}} She saw the role of the AID Project as one of advising and assisting in developing strategy, but allowing communities to establish their own goals and management processes.{{sfn|Goodwin|2017|p=97}} That same year, she was selected as the "Outstanding Indian" of the year by the [[American Indian Exposition]] of [[Anadarko, Oklahoma]].{{sfn|''The Ada Weekly News''|1952|p=6}} When [[Helen Peterson]] became the executive director of NCAI in 1953, Roe Cloud helped her transition into the job and took her to reservations throughout Indian country to make assessments of the various tribes and establish networking contacts.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=110}} With the passage of [[House concurrent resolution 108]], designed to implement the [[Indian termination policy]] to discharge federal trustee responsibility for Indian lands and force the tribes into [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|assimilating]] to mainstream culture, Roe Cloud pressed the GFWC to oppose legislation aimed at terminating tribes.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|pp=102–103}} The GFWC leadership joined the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], the [[American Legion]], other organizations, and the Native American community in opposition to termination, ultimately defeating the policy in the 1960s.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=103}}

==Death and Legacy==
Roe Cloud died on September 16, 1965 in [[Portland, Oregon]].{{sfn|''Statesman Journal''|1965|p=5}} Her ability to straddle two worlds, during the contentious decades of the Indian termination policies, allowed her to serve as a role model for generations which followed her activism. Rather than adopt the position of GFWG's first Indian Welfare Committee Chair, Stella Atwood, who backed American Indian rights, but proclaimed, "I will work ''for'' the Indians but not with them," Roe Cloud tried to involve indigenous people in creating their own solutions and reforms.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=104}}{{sfn|Goodwin|2017|p=120}} Her daughter, Anne Woesha, would become an activist after her mother's death, participating in the [[Occupation of Alcatraz]].{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=105}}

An '''empirical theory of perception''' is a kind of explanation for how [[percept]]s arise. These theories hold that sensory systems incorporate information about the statistical properties of the natural world into their design and relate incoming stimuli to this information, rather than analyzing sensory stimulation into its components or [[Feature detection (nervous system)|features]].

== Empirical accounts of vision ==
[[Visual perception]] is initiated when objects in the world reflect light [[Ray (optics)|rays]] towards the eye. Most empirical theories of visual perception begin with the observation that stimulation of the [[retina]] is fundamentally ambiguous. In empirical accounts, the most commonly proposed mechanism for circumventing this ambiguity is "[[unconscious inference]]," a term that dates back to [[Helmholtz]].

According to Hatfield,&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield, Gary. Perception as Unconscious Inference. Accessed from http://repository.upenn.edu/ircs_reports/9/ .&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alhazen#Book of Optics|Alhazen]] was the first to propose that higher-level cognitive processes ("judgments") could supplement sense perception to lead to veridical perception of distance, suggesting that these "judgments" are formally equivalent to [[syllogisms]]. [[Descartes]] extended and refined this account. [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] departed from this tradition, putting forth the new idea that sensory systems, rather than performing logical operations on stimuli to reach veridical conclusions (i.e. these light rays come with certain orientations relative to each other, therefore their source is at a certain distance), make ''associations'', so that for instance if certain co-occurring sensory attributes are usually present when an object is at a given distance an observer would see an object with those attributes as being at that distance. For Helmholtz Berkeleyan associations form the premises for inductive "judgements," in Alhazen's sense of the term. [[Helmholtz]] was one of the first thinkers on the subject to augment his reasoning with detailed knowledge of the anatomy of sensory mechanisms.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In current work Helmholtz's use of the term is construed as referring to some mechanism that augments sense impressions with acquired knowledge or through application of [[heuristics]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} In general, contemporary empirical theories of perception seek to describe and/or explain the physiological underpinnings of this "unconscious inference," particularly in terms of how sensory systems acquire information about general statistical features of their environments (see [[natural scene statistics]]) and apply this information to sensory data in order to shape perception. A recurring theme in these theories is that stimulus ambiguity is rectified by ''a priori'' knowledge about the natural world.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Wholly empirical approach to visual perception==
The wholly empirical approach to perception, developed by [[Dale Purves]] and his colleagues, holds that percepts are determined solely by evolutionary and individual experience with sensory impressions and the objects from which they derive. The success or failure of behavior in response to these sensory impressions tends to increase the prevalence of neural structures that support some ways of interpreting sensory input while decreasing the prevalence of neural structures that support other ways of interpreting sensory input.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Purves|first=Dale|last2=Monson|first2=Brian B.|last3=Sundararajan|first3=Janani|last4=Wojtach|first4=William T.|date=2014-04-01|title=How biological vision succeeds in the physical world|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/13/4750|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=111|issue=13|pages=4750–4755|doi=10.1073/pnas.1311309111|issn=0027-8424|pmc=3977276|pmid=24639506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The wholly empirical strategy ===
{{inappropriate person|date=March 2013}}

The wholly empirical theory of perception departs from many other empirical theories by recognizing the seriousness of the [[inverse problem in optics|optical inverse problem]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} To illustrate this problem, imagine that three hoses are used to fill a bucket with water. If how much water each hose has contributed is known, it is straightforward to calculate how much water is in the bucket. These kinds of problems are known as “forward” problems, and scientists like them because they are easy to solve. But if instead, all that is known is the amount of water in the bucket, it is impossible to figure out, on this basis alone, how much water came from each hose: it is impossible to work “backwards” from the bucket to the hoses.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} This is a simple example of an [[inverse problem]].  Solutions to these problems are rarely possible, although they can sometimes be approximated by imposing assumption-based constraints on the “[[solution space]]”.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Navigating the world on the basis of sensory stimulation alone represents an inverse problem in the realm of biology. Consider, for example, the case of the distance and line length. When light reflected from a [[linearity|linear]] object falls on the [[retina]], the object in 3-D space is transformed into a two-dimensional line.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Note, however, that a distant line can form the same image on the retina as a shorter but close line. All the eyes receive is an image, which is analogous to the bucket of water. It is impossible to go backward to know the real distance, length, and orientation of the source of the projected line, analogous to the amounts of water that came from each hose. Despite this fact, percipients usually manage to behave effectively in response to sensory stimulation.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The inverse optics problem presents a quandary for traditional approaches to perception. For example, advocates of [[Feature detection (nervous system)|feature detection]] or, in more current terms, neural [[filter (signal processing)|filtering]], propose that the visual system performs logical computations on retinal inputs to determine higher-level aspects of a perceptual scene such as contrast, contour, shape and color percepts.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} However, given the inverse problem, it is hard to imagine how these computations, if they were actually performed, would be useful, since they would have little or nothing to do with properties of the real world. Empirical approaches to perception take a different tack, arguing that the only way for organisms to successfully overcome the inverse problem is to exploit their long and varied past experience with the real world.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}
	
The wholly empirical approach holds that this experience is the sole determinant of perceptual qualities. The reason percipients see an object as dark or light, the argument goes, is that in both our own past and the past of the species it paid off to see it that particular way. Returning to the bucket analogy, imagine that each of the three hoses pumps out water of a different color: one pumps out black water, one pumps out gray water, and one pumps out clear water.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} All one sees is the water in the bucket, which can be clear, gray, black, or any shade in between. As expected, it is impossible to perform some calculation on the color of the water in the bucket to find out how much water came out of each hose. Now imagine that it is your job to bet on how much water came out of the gray hose. The output ratios of the hoses are not random, but [[covariance|co-vary]] in all kinds of complicated ways based on the time of day, how long it takes to fill up the bucket, etc. At first your behavior in response to the color of the bucket might not be so good, but over time this would gradually improve as different shades and behaviors in response became associated by trial and error. The key is that in order to improve you have to know whether or not your behaviors worked by interacting with the world.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

On the wholly empirical view, the retinal image is like the bucket and what you see is determined by past behaviors that have succeeded. Although this example is simplistic, it illustrates the general strategy that visual system uses to work around the inverse problem.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Over millions of years individuals whose visual systems more successfully linked sensory stimulation with successful behavior won out. In this view the inverse problem is not actually solved—which would be analogous to computing the outputs of all three hoses—the result might be close enough to behave appropriately in response to stimuli.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Color ===

[[Color vision]] is dependent on activation of three [[cone cell]] types in the human retina, each of which is primarily responsive to a different spectrum of [[physics of light|light frequencies]]. While these [[retina]]l mechanisms enable subsequent color processing, their properties alone cannot account for the full range of color perception phenomena. In part this is due to the fact that [[illuminance]] (the amount of light shining on an object), [[reflectance]] (the amount of light an object is predisposed to reflect), and [[transmittance]] (the extent to which the light medium distorts the light as it travels) are conflated in the retinal image. This is problematic because, if color vision is to be useful, it must somehow guide behavior in line with these properties. Even so, the visual system only has access to retinal input, which does not distinguish the relative contributions of each of these factors to the final [[electromagnetic spectrum|light spectra]] that stimulate the [[retina]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

According to the empirical framework, the visual system solves this problem by drawing on species and individual experience with retinal images that have signified different combinations of illuminance, reflectance, and transmittance in the past. Only those associations that led to appropriate behavior were retained through evolution and development, leading to a repertoire of neural associations and predispositions that ground color perception in the world.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

One way to test this idea is to see whether the frequency of co-occurrence of light spectra predicts simultaneous color contrast effects (see side image, Fig. 1). Long and Purves&lt;ref&gt;Natural scene statistics as the universal basis for color context effects. Long F, Purves D. Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences 100(25): 15190-15193. (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; showed that by sampling thousands of [[scene statistics|natural images]], analysis of associations between target colors and the colors of their surrounds could explain perceptual effects like those seen on the right. Rather than explaining the diverging color percepts as unfortunate byproducts of a normally veridical color perception mechanism, according to this work the different colors humans see are simply the byproducts of our species and individual exposure to the distribution of color spectra in the world.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Brightness ===
[[File:Grey square optical illusion.svg|thumb|alt=Striking demonstration of simultaneous brightness contrast.|Fig. 2. Squares A and B are identical in luminance returns but look differently bright depending on context.]]
’’[[Brightness]]’’ refers to a subjective sense that the object considered is emitting light. Whereas the perceptual correlates of color are the frequencies of light that compose the [[visible spectrum|light spectrum]], the perceptual correlate of brightness is [[luminance]], or the intensity of light emitted by an object. While it may seem obvious that the sensation of brightness is straightforwardly related to the amount or intensity of light coming to the eyes, perception researchers have long known that brightness is not caused solely by the luminance incident on the retina.&lt;ref&gt;Fechner G.T., Adler, H.E., Howes, D.H. &amp; Boring, E.G., (1966) Elements of Psychophysics (Holt Rinehart and Winston, New York).&lt;/ref&gt; A common example is simultaneous brightness contrast (shown to the right), in which the two identical target diamonds appear differently bright.

In the empirical account, the same general framework used to rationalize simultaneous color contrast applies to simultaneous [[brightness]] contrast. Because the three factors that determine luminance emissions—[[transmittance]], [[reflectance]], and [[illuminance]]—are blended in the retinal image of the object, operations on the luminance returns as such cannot in principle yield percepts that are good guides to behavior.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The visual system solves this problem by associating luminance values and their given contexts with the success or failure of ensuing behavior, leading to percepts that often (but only incidentally) reflect properties of objects rather than their associated images.

The image on the right (Fig. 2.) strongly supports this view of how brightness perception works. Although other frameworks have either no explanation for this effect or explanations that are highly inconsistent with their explanations for similar effects, the empirical framework makes the case that the perceived brightness differences are due to empirical associations between the targets and their respective contexts. In this case, because the “lighter” targets would typically have been shadowed, humans perceive them in a way that is consistent with their having a higher [[reflectance]] despite their presumably low levels of [[illuminance]]. Note that this approach is considerably different from computational “context”-driven approaches, since in this case the target/context relationships are contingent and world-based, and therefore cannot be generalized to other cases in any meaningful way.

=== Line length ===

Perception of line length is confounded by another [[inverse problem in optics|optical inverse problem]]: the further away a line in the world, the smaller the projected line will be on the retina. Different orientations of a line relative to the observer may obscure true line length as well. It is well known that straight lines are erroneously reported as longer or shorter as a function of their angular orientation,&lt;ref&gt;Shipley W C, Mann B M, Penfield M J (1949) J Exp Psychol 39:548–551&lt;/ref&gt; as is evident in Fig. 3. While no generally accepted explanations of this phenomenon have been offered previously, the empirical approach has had some success in explaining the effect as a function of the distribution of lines in natural scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Howe and Purves  (2002). PNAS  99(20): 13184-13188.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Howe and Purves (2002) analyzed [[scene statistics|natural scene]] photographs to find projected lines that corresponded to straight line sources. They found that the ratios of the actual length of the lines to the projected lines on the retina, when classified by their respective orientations on the retina, almost perfectly matched subjective estimation of line length as a function of angle relative to the observer. For example, horizontal lines on the retinal image would typically have turned out to issue from relatively short physical sources, while lines at about 60 degrees relative to the observer would typically have signified longer physical sources, which explains why individuals tend to see the 60° line in Fig. 3 as longer than the 0° (horizontal) line. While there is no way for the visual system to know this ''a priori'', the fact that it seems to take this knowledge for granted in its construction of length estimation percepts strongly supports the wholly empirical view of perception.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Motion ===
Perception of motion is also confounded by an inverse problem: movement in three-dimensional space does not map perfectly onto movement on the retinal plane. A distant object moving at a given speed will translate more slowly on the retina than a nearby object moving at the same speed, and as mentioned previously size, distance and orientation are also ambiguous given only the retinal image. As with other aspects of perception, empirical theorists propose that this problem is solved by trial-and-error experience with moving stimuli, their associated retinal images and the consequences of behavior.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} 
One way to test this hypothesis is by seeing whether it can explain the [[flash lag illusion]], a visual effect in which a flash superimposed on a moving bar is falsely seen to lag behind the bar. The task for empirical theorists is to explain why individuals perceive the flash in this way, and further, why the perceived lag increases with the speed of the moving bar. To investigate this question, Wojtach et al. (2008)&lt;ref&gt;An empirical explanation of the flash-lag effect. Wojtach W.T., Sung K., Truong S., Purves D. (2008) Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences 105(2): 16338-16343.&lt;/ref&gt; simulated a three-dimensional environment full of moving virtual particles. They modeled the transformation from three dimensions to the two-dimensional image plane and tallied up the frequency of occurrence of particle speeds, particle distances, image speeds, and image distances (image meaning the path projected across the computer-modeled “retina”). The [[probability distributions]] they obtained in this way predicted the magnitude of the bar-flash disparity quite well. The authors concluded that the flash-lag effect was a signature of the way brains evolve and develop to behave appropriately in response to moving retinal images.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55705">'''Enactivism''' argues that [[cognition]] arises through a dynamic interaction between an acting [[organism]] and its environment.&lt;ref name="Evan Thompson"/&gt; It claims that our environment is one which we selectively create through our capacities to interact with the world.&lt;ref name=Rowlands/&gt; "Organisms do not passively receive information from their environments, which they then translate into internal representations. Natural cognitive systems...participate in the generation of meaning ...engaging in transformational and not merely informational interactions: ''they enact a world''."&lt;ref name=Jaegher1/&gt; These authors suggest that the increasing emphasis upon enactive terminology presages a new era in thinking about cognitive science.&lt;ref name=Jaegher1/&gt; How the actions involved in enactivism relate to age-old questions about [[free will]] remains a topic of active debate.&lt;ref name=Manetti/&gt;

The term 'enactivism' is close in meaning to 'enaction', defined as "the manner in which a subject of perception creatively matches its actions to the requirements of its situation".&lt;ref name=Tascano0/&gt; The introduction of the term ''enaction'' in this context is attributed to  [[Francisco Varela]], [[Evan Thompson]], and [[Eleanor Rosch]],&lt;ref name=Tascano0/&gt;&lt;ref name=RWilson/&gt; who proposed the name to "emphasize the growing conviction that cognition is not the representation of a pre-given world by a pre-given mind but is rather the enactment of a world and a mind on the basis of a history of the variety of actions that a being in the world performs".&lt;ref name=Varela/&gt; This was further developed by Thompson and others,&lt;ref name="Evan Thompson"/&gt; to place emphasis upon the idea that experience of the world is a result of mutual interaction between the sensorimotor capacities of the organism and its environment.&lt;ref name=RWilson/&gt;

The initial emphasis of enactivism upon sensorimotor skills has been criticized as "cognitively marginal",&lt;ref name=ClarkA/&gt; but it has been extended to apply to higher level cognitive activities, such as social interactions.&lt;ref name="Jaegher1"/&gt; "In the enactive view,... knowledge is constructed: it is constructed by an agent through its sensorimotor interactions with its environment, co-constructed between and within living species through their meaningful interaction with each other. In its most abstract form, knowledge is co-constructed between human individuals in socio-linguistic interactions...Science is a particular form of social knowledge construction...[that] allows us to perceive and predict events beyond our immediate cognitive grasp...and also to construct further, even more powerful scientific knowledge."&lt;ref name=Rohde/&gt;

Enactivism is closely related to [[situated cognition]] and [[embodied cognition]], and is presented as an alternative to [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], [[computationalism]], and [[Cartesian dualism]].

==Philosophical aspects&lt;!--'Enaction (philosophy)' redirects here--&gt;==

Enactivism is one of  a cluster of related theories sometimes known as the ''4Es''.&lt;ref name=Gallagher/&gt; As described by [[Mark Rowlands]], mental processes are:
* '''Embodied''' involving more than the brain, including a more general involvement of bodily structures and processes.
* '''Embedded''' functioning only in a related external environment.
* '''Enacted''' involving not only neural processes, but also things an organism ''does''.
* '''Extended''' into the organism's environment.

Enactivism proposes an alternative to [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] as a philosophy of mind, in that it emphasises the interactions between mind, body and the environment, seeing them all as inseparably intertwined in mental processes.&lt;ref name=EThompson/&gt; The self arises as part of the process of an embodied entity interacting with the environment in precise ways determined by its physiology.   In this sense, individuals can be seen to "grow into" or arise from their interactive role with the world.&lt;ref name=Burman/&gt;
:"Enaction is the idea that organisms create their own experience through their actions. Organisms are not passive receivers of input from the environment, but are actors in the environment such that what they experience is shaped by how they act."&lt;ref name=Hutchins/&gt;

In ''The Tree of Knowledge'' Maturana &amp; Varela proposed the term ''enactive''&lt;ref name=Maturana/&gt; "to evoke the view of knowledge that what is known is brought forth, in contraposition to the more classical views of either cognitivism&lt;ref group=Note name=Cognitivism/&gt; or connectionism.&lt;ref group=Note name=Connectionism/&gt; They see enactivism as providing a middle ground between the two extremes of [[representationalism]] and [[solipsism]]. They seek to "confront the problem of understanding how our existence-the [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] of our living- is coupled to a surrounding world which appears filled with regularities that are at every instant the result of our biological and social histories.... to find a ''via media'': to understand the regularity of the world we are experiencing at every moment, but without any point of reference independent of ourselves that would give certainty to our descriptions and cognitive assertions.  Indeed the whole mechanism of generating ourselves, as describers and observers tells us that our world, as the world which we bring forth in our coexistence with others, will always have precisely that mixture of regularity and mutability, that combination of solidity and shifting sand, so typical of human experience when we look at it up close."[''Tree of Knowledge'', p.&amp;nbsp;241]

Enactivism also addresses the [[hard problem of consciousness]], referred to by Thompson as part of the ''[[explanatory gap]]'' in explaining how consciousness and subjective experience are related to brain and body.&lt;ref name=EThompson2/&gt;  "The problem with the dualistic concepts of consciousness and life in standard formulations of the hard problem is that they exclude each other by construction".&lt;ref name=EThompson3/&gt; Instead, according to Thompson's view of enactivism, the study of consciousness or [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] as exemplified by [[Husserl]] and [[Merleau-Ponty]] is to complement science and its objectification of the world. "The whole universe of science is built upon the world as directly experienced, and if we want to subject science itself to rigorous scrutiny and arrive at a precise assessment of its meaning and scope, we must begin by reawakening the basic experience of the world of which science is the second-order expression" (Merleau-Ponty, ''The phenomenology of perception'' as quoted by Thompson, p.&amp;nbsp;165). In this interpretation, enactivism asserts that science is formed or enacted as part of humankind's interactivity with its world, and by embracing phenomenology "science itself is properly situated in relation to the rest of human life and is thereby secured on a sounder footing."&lt;ref name=EThompson4/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baldwin/&gt;

Enaction has been seen as a move to conjoin [[representationalism]] with [[phenomenalism]], that is, as adopting a [[constructivist epistemology]], an epistemology centered upon the active participation of the subject in constructing reality.&lt;ref name=Mutelesi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chiari/&gt; However, 'constructivism' focuses upon more than a simple 'interactivity' that could be described as a minor adjustment to 'assimilate' reality or 'accommodate' to it.&lt;ref name=Glaserfeld/&gt; Constructivism looks upon interactivity as a radical, creative, revisionist process in which the knower ''constructs'' a personal 'knowledge system' based upon their experience and tested by its viability in practical encounters with their environment. Learning is a result of perceived anomalies that produce dissatisfaction with existing conceptions.&lt;ref name=Glasersfeld2/&gt;

How does constructivism relate to enactivism? From the above remarks it can be seen that [[Ernst von Glasersfeld|Glasersfeld]] expresses an interactivity between the knower and the known quite acceptable to an enactivist, but does not emphasize  the structured probing of the environment by the knower that leads to the "perturbation relative to some expected result" that then leads to a new understanding.&lt;ref name=Glasersfeld2/&gt; It is this probing activity, especially where it is not accidental but deliberate, that characterizes enaction, and invokes ''affect'',&lt;ref name=Ward2/&gt; that is, the motivation and planning that lead to doing and to fashioning the probing, both observing and modifying the environment, so that "perceptions and nature condition one another through generating one another."&lt;ref name=Diettrich/&gt; The questioning nature of this probing activity is not an emphasis of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] and Glasersfeld.

Sharing enactivism's stress upon both action and embodiment in the incorporation of knowledge, but giving Glasersfeld's mechanism of viability an [[Introduction to evolution|evolutionary]] emphasis,&lt;ref name=Diettrich2/&gt; is [[evolutionary epistemology]]. Inasmuch as an organism must reflect its environment well enough for the organism to be able to survive in it, and to be competitive enough to be able to reproduce at sustainable rate, the structure and reflexes of the organism itself embody knowledge of its environment. This biology-inspired theory of the growth of knowledge is closely tied to [[universal Darwinism]], and is associated with evolutionary epistemologists such as [[Karl Popper]], [[Donald T. Campbell]], [[Peter Munz]], and [[Gary Cziko]].&lt;ref name=Gontier/&gt; According to Munz, "an organism is an ''embodied theory'' about its environment... Embodied theories are also no longer expressed in language, but in anatomical structures or reflex responses, etc."&lt;ref name=Gontier/&gt;&lt;ref name=Munz/&gt;

===Enactive views of perception===
In the enactive view, perception "is not conceived as the transmission of information but more as an exploration of the world by various means. Cognition is not tied into the workings of an 'inner mind', some cognitive core, but occurs in directed interaction between the body and the world it inhabits."&lt;ref name=McGann2&gt;

[[Alva Noë]] in advocating an enactive view of perception&lt;ref name=Noe&gt;
{{cite book |author=Alva Noë |title= Action in Perception |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFKvU2hPhxEC&amp;pg=PA1 |pages=1 ''ff'' |chapter=Chapter 1: The enactive approach to perception: An introduction |isbn=9780262140881 |year=2004 |publisher=MIT Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt; sought to resolve how we perceive three-dimensional objects, on the basis of two-dimensional input.  He argues that we perceive this solidity (or 'volumetricity') by appealing to patterns of sensorimotor expectations. These arise from our agent-active  'movements and interaction' with objects, or 'object-active' changes in the object itself. The solidity is perceived through our expectations and skills in knowing how the object's appearance would change with changes in how we relate to it. He saw all perception as an active exploration of the world, rather than being a passive process, something which happens to us.

Noë's idea of the role of 'expectations' in three-dimensional perception has been opposed by several philosophers, notably by [[Andy Clark]].&lt;ref name=ClarkA1/&gt; Clark points to difficulties of the enactive approach.  He points to internal processing of visual signals, for example, in the ventral and dorsal pathways, [[Two-streams hypothesis|the two-streams hypothesis]]. This results in an integrated perception of objects (their recognition and location, respectively) yet this processing cannot be described as an action or actions. In a more general criticism, Clark suggests that perception is not a matter of expectations about sensorimotor mechanisms guiding perception. Rather, although the limitations of sensorimotor mechanisms constrain perception, this sensorimotor activity is drastically filtered to fit current needs and purposes of the organism, and it is these imposed 'expectations' that govern perception, filtering for the 'relevant' details of sensorimotor input (called "sensorimotor summarizing").&lt;ref name=ClarkA1/&gt;

These sensorimotor-centered and purpose-centered views appear to agree on the general scheme but disagree on the dominance issue – is the dominant component peripheral or central. Another view, the closed-loop perception one, assigns equal a-priori dominance to the peripheral and central components. In closed-loop perception, perception emerges through the process of inclusion of an item in a motor-sensory-motor loop, i.e., a loop (or loops) connecting the peripheral and central components that are relevant to that item. The item can be a body part (in which case the loops are in steady-state) or an external object (in which case the loops are perturbed and gradually converge to a steady state). These enactive loops are always active, switching dominance by the need.

Another application of enaction to perception is analysis of the human hand. The many remarkably demanding uses of the hand are not learned by instruction, but through a history of engagements that lead to the acquisition of skills. According to one interpretation, it is suggested that "the hand [is]...an organ of cognition", not a faithful subordinate working under top-down instruction, but a partner in a "bi-directional interplay between manual and brain activity."&lt;ref name="Hutto"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Daniel Hutto]]: "Enactivists are concerned to defend the view that our most elementary ways of engaging with the world and others - including our basic forms of perception and perceptual experience - are mindful in the sense of being phenomenally charged and intentionally directed, despite being non-representational and content-free."&lt;ref name="Hutto2"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Hutto calls this position 'REC' (&lt;u&gt;R&lt;/u&gt;adical &lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt;nactive &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;ognition): "According to REC, there is no way to distinguish neural activity that is imagined to be genuinely content involving (and thus truly mental, truly cognitive) from other non-neural activity that merely plays a supporting or enabling role in making mind and cognition possible."&lt;ref name="Hutto2" /&gt;

===Participatory sense-making===

[[Hanne De Jaegher]] and [[Ezequiel Di Paolo]] (2007)&lt;ref name="DeJaeger0"/&gt; have extended the enactive concept of sense-making&lt;ref name="EThompson3"/&gt; into the social domain. The idea takes as its departure point the process of interaction between individuals in a social encounter.&lt;ref name=DeJaegher_etal&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hanne De Jaegher |author2=Ezequiel Di Paolo |author3=Shaun Gallagher |title= Can social interaction constitute social cognition? |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |year=2010  |volume=14 |issue=10 |pages=441–447 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.06.009 |pmid=20674467}}
&lt;/ref&gt; De Jaegher and Di Paolo argue that the interaction process itself can take on a form of autonomy (operationally defined). This allows them to define social cognition as the generation of meaning and its transformation through interacting individuals.

The notion of participatory sense-making has led to the proposal that interaction processes can sometimes play constitutive roles in social cognition (De Jaegher, Di Paolo, Gallagher, 2010).&lt;ref name="DeJaegher1"/&gt; It has been applied to research in [[social neuroscience]]''&lt;ref name="DiPaolo3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SchilbachTimmermans&gt;
{{cite journal |author1=Leonhard Schilbach |author2=Bert Timmermans |author3=Vasudevi Reddy |author4=Alan Costall |author5=Gary Bente |author6=Tobias Schlicht |author7=Kai Vogeley |title= Toward a second-person neuroscience |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |year=2013  |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=393–414 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X12000660}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' and [[autism]].''&lt;ref name="DeJaegher_autism"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hanne De Jaegher |title= Embodiment and sense-making in autism|journal=Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience |year=2012  |volume=7 |pages=15 |doi=10.3389/fnint.2013.00015}}
&lt;/ref&gt;''

In a similar vein, "an inter-enactive approach to agency holds that the behavior of agents in a social situation unfolds not only according to their individual abilities and goals, but also according to the conditions and constraints imposed by the autonomous dynamics of the interaction process itself".&lt;ref name=STorrance&gt;
{{cite journal |title=An Inter-Enactive Approach to Agency: Participatory Sense-Making, Dynamics, and Sociality |author1=Steve Torrance |author2=Tom Froese |url=http://sacral.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pdf/froese_humana_2011.pdf |journal=Human Mente |volume=15 |pages=21–53 |year=2011 }} 
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Torrance, enactivism involves five interlocking themes related to the question "What is it to be a (cognizing, conscious) agent?" It is:&lt;ref name=STorrance/&gt;
:1. to be a biologically autonomous ([[Autopoiesis|autopoietic]]) organism
:2. to generate ''significance'' or ''meaning'', rather than to act via...updated internal representations of the external world
:3. to engage in sense-making via dynamic coupling with the environment
:4. to 'enact' or 'bring forth' a world of significances by mutual co-determination of the organism with its enacted world
:5. to arrive at an experiential awareness via lived embodiment in the world.

Torrance adds that "many kinds of agency, in particular the agency of human beings, cannot be understood separately from understanding the nature of the interaction that occurs between agents." That view introduces the social applications of enactivism. "Social cognition is regarded as the result of a special form of action, namely ''social interaction''...the enactive approach looks at the circular dynamic within a dyad of embodied agents."&lt;ref name=FuchsT&gt;

In [[cultural psychology]], enactivism is seen as a way to uncover cultural influences upon feeling, thinking and acting.&lt;ref name=Verheggen&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 8: Enactivism |author1=Cor Baerveldt |author2=Theo Verheggen |title=The Oxford Handbook of Culture and Psychology  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WljI1r2e-SUC&amp;pg=PA165 |pages=165''ff'' |doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195396430.013.0009 |isbn=9780195396430 |date=May 2012 |quote= Whereas the enactive approach in general has focused on sense-making as an embodied and situated activity, enactive cultural psychology emphasizes the expressive and dynamically enacted nature of cultural meaning.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Baerveldt and Verheggen argue that "It appears that seemingly natural experience is thoroughly intertwined with sociocultural realities." They suggest that the social patterning of experience is to be understood through enactivism, "the idea that the reality we have in common, and in which we find ourselves, is neither a world that exists independently from us, nor a socially shared way of representing such a pregiven world, but a world itself brought forth by our ways of communicating and our joint action....The world we inhabit is manufactured of 'meaning' rather than 'information'.&lt;ref name=Baerveldt&gt;

The ideas of enactivism regarding how organisms engage with their environment have interested those involved in [[Cognitive robotics|robotics]] and [[Human–computer interaction|man-machine interfaces]]. The analogy is drawn that a robot can be designed to interact and learn from its environment in a manner similar to the way an organism does that,&lt;ref name=Sandini&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and a human can interact with a computer-aided design tool or data base using an interface that creates an enactive environment for the user, that is, all the user's tactile, auditory, and visual capabilities are enlisted in a mutually explorative engagement, capitalizing upon all the user's abilities, and not at all limited to cerebral engagement.&lt;ref name=Bordegoni&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; McGann, De Jaegher, and Di Paolo discuss how this work makes the dynamics of coupling between an agent and its environment, the foundation of enactivism, "an operational, empirically observable phenomenon."&lt;ref name=McGann3&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Marek McGann |author2=Hanne De Jaegher |author3=Ezequiel Di Paolo |year= 2013 |title=Enaction and psychology |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=203–209 |url= https://www.academia.edu/4993021/Enaction_and_Psychology |doi= 10.1037/a0032935 |quote=Such modeling techniques allow us to explore the parameter space of coupling between agent and environment...to the point that their basic principles (the universals, if such there are, of enactive psychology) can be brought clearly into view.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the AI environment invents examples of enactivism using concrete examples that, although not as complex as living organisms, isolate and illuminate basic principles.

{{Emotion}}

'''Envy''' (from Latin ''[[invidia]]'') is an [[emotion]] which "occurs when a person lacks another's superior quality, achievement, or possession and either desires it or wishes that the other lacked it".&lt;ref name="Parrot, Smith, 1993 "&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parrott | first1 = W. G. | last2 = Smith | first2 = R. H. | year = 1993 | title = Distinguishing the experiences of envy and jealousy | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 906–920 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.6.906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] defined envy as pain at the sight of another’s good fortune, stirred by “those who have what we ought to have.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.mb.txt Rhetoric By Aristotle]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] said that envy was one of the most potent causes of unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Conquest of Happiness|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|publisher=[[Horace Liveright|H. Liverwright]]|year=1930|location=[[New York City|New York]]|page=&lt;!-- insert page number --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only is the envious person rendered unhappy by his or her envy, Russell explained, but that person may also wish to inflict misfortune on others, in forms of emotional abuse and violent acts of criminality. Although envy is generally seen as something negative, Russell also believed that envy was a driving force behind the movement of economies and must be endured to achieve the "keep up with Jones" system. He believed this is what helps to maintain democracy, a system where no one can achieve more than anyone else.&lt;ref&gt;Russell (1930), pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have recently suggested that there are two types of envy: malicious envy and benign envy—malicious envy being proposed as a sick force that ruins a person and his/her mind and causes the envious person to blindly want the "hero" to suffer; on the other hand, benign envy being proposed as a type of positive motivational force that causes the person to aspire to be as good as the "hero"—but only if benign envy is used in a right way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Leveling up and down: the experiences of benign and malicious envy.|display-authors=etal|author=van de Ven N|pmid=19485619|doi=10.1037/a0015669|volume=9|journal=Emotion|pages=419–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spring.org.uk/2011/05/why-envy-motivates-us.php|title=Why Envy Motivates Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Sherry Turkle]] considers that  the advent of social media and selfie culture is creating an alienating sense of “self-envy” psyche in users, and posits this further affects problem areas attached to attachments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sherry Turkle|title=Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AjFXDgAAQBAJ|year=2017|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-09366-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Envy and gloating have parallel structures as emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/envy.htm|title=Emotional Competency - Envy|website=www.emotionalcompetency.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sentic.net/hourglass-of-emotions.pdf |title=LNCS 7403 - The Hourglass of Emotions |format=PDF |website=Sentic.net |date= |accessdate=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only type of envy that can have positive effects is benign envy. According to researchers, benign envy can provide emulation, improvement motivation, positive thoughts about the other person, and admiration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lange |first1=Jens |last2=Crusius |first2=Jan |last3=Weidman |first3=Aaron |title=The Painful Duality of Envy: Evidence for an Integrative Theory and a Meta-Analysis on the Relation of Envy and Schadenfreude}}&lt;/ref&gt;.This type of envy, if dealt with correctly, can positively effect a persons future by motivating them to be a better person and to succeed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=van de Ven |first1=Niels |title=Envy and Its Consequences: Why It Is Useful to Distinguish between Benign and Malicious Envy |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/spc3.12253 |website=online library |publisher=John Wiley and Sons LTD.}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Our human instinct is to avoid negative aspects in life such as the negative emotion, envy. However, it is possible to turn this negative emotional state into a motivational tool that can help a person to become successful in the future.

== Socioevolutionary view ==
[[File:Giotto - Scrovegni - -48- - Envy.jpg|thumb|''Invidia'', [[allegory|allegorical]] painting by [[Giotto di Bondone]], ca. 1305-1306]]
One theory that helps explain envy and its effects on human behavior is the Socioevolutionary theory. Based upon (Charles) Darwin's (1859) theory of evolution through [[natural selection]], socioevolutionary theory predicts that humans behave in ways that enhance individual survival and the reproduction of their genes. Thus, this theory provides a framework for understanding social behavior and experiences, such as the experience and expression of envy, as rooted in biological drives for survival and procreation.&lt;ref name="ehis.ebscohost.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yoshimura|first=C.G|year=2010|title= The experience and communication of envy among siblings, siblings-in-law, and spouses|publisher=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=876f3f3d-bc01-4f81-b58c-1a9c4db40db0%40sessionmgr4&amp;vid=6&amp;hid=20}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have demonstrated that inciting envy actually changes cognitive function, boosting mental persistence and memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fields|first=R|year=2011|title= Eat Your Guts Out: Why Envy Hurts and Why It's Good for Your Brain|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-new-brain/201109/eat-your-guts-out-why-envy-hurts-and-why-its-good-your-brain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Schadenfreude ==
{{Main|Schadenfreude}}
''Schadenfreude'' means taking pleasure in the misfortune of others and can be understood as an outgrowth of envy in certain situations.

Envy and Schadenfreude are very similar and are linked emotional states. Both emotions are considered very complex and often times looked down upon, which is understandable considering they are both antisocial behaviors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zizzo |first1=Daniel |title=Money burning and rank egalitarianism with random dictators |date=2003 |volume=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Given the detrimental states of these emotions, it is very important to understand their development in the early stages of childhood.

The two social emotions, envy and schadenfreude act together as sister emotions during the developmental stages in adolescents. Both emotions have a strong presence during these early stages in a child's life. However, as a person ages ,the more they begin to conceal these “bad” emotions and learn to regulate.  

In previous studies, it has been shown that envy becomes less prevalent as a child gets older. Researchers believe that this results from an increase in the regulation of envious type emotions as a person ages and gains more wisdom about life. Depending on age, the correlation of envy and schadenfreude increases. For example a younger child is more likely to make spiteful decisions when they feel envious towards a person. 

== Regarding possessions or status ==
[[File:Jheronimus Bosch Table of the Mortal Sins (Invidia).jpg|thumb|left|[[Hieronymus Bosch]], ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things]]'' (Invidia)]]

Often, envy involves a motive to "outdo or undo the rival's advantages".&lt;ref&gt;D'Arms, J. (2009). Envy. Unpublished manuscript, ''Stanford Encyclopedia of philosophy'', Stanford, Retrieved from Plato.stanford.edu/entries/envy/&lt;/ref&gt; In part, this type of envy may be based on materialistic possessions rather than psychological states. Basically, people find themselves experiencing an overwhelming emotion due to someone else owning or possessing desirable items that they do not. For example, your next door neighbor just bought a brand new [[ocarina]]—a musical instrument you've been infatuated with for months now but can't afford. Feelings of envy in this situation would occur in the forms of emotional pain, a lack of [[self-worth]], and a lowered [[self-esteem]]/[[well-being]].

In Nelson Aldrich's ''Old Money'', he states that "envy is so integral and painful a part of what animates human behavior in market societies that many people have forgotten the full meaning of the word, simplifying it into one of the symptoms of desire. It is that (a symptom of [[Desire (emotion)|desire]]), which is why it flourishes in market societies: democracies of desire, they might be called, with money for ballots, stuffing permitted. But envy is more or less than desire. It begins with the almost frantic sense of [[emptiness]] inside oneself, as if the pump of one's heart were sucking on air. One has to be blind to perceive the emptiness, of course, but that's what envy is, a selective blindness. ''Invidia'', Latin for envy, translates as "nonsight," and Dante had the envious plodding along under cloaks of lead, their eyes sewn shut with leaden wire. What they are blind to is what they have, God-given and humanly nurtured, in themselves".&lt;ref name="Hacker, Diana 1996. p. 23"&gt;Hacker, Diana. ''A Canadian Writer's Reference'', 2nd Ed. Nelson Canada, 1996. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overcoming ==
Envy may negatively affect the closeness and satisfaction of relationships. Overcoming envy might be similar to dealing with other negative emotions ([[anger]], [[resentment]], etc.). Individuals experiencing anger often seek professional treatment ([[anger management]]) to help understand why they feel the way they do and how to cope. Subjects experiencing envy often have a skewed perception on how to achieve true [[happiness]]. By helping people to change these perceptions, they will be more able to understand the real meaning of fortune and satisfaction with what they do have. According to Lazarus "coping is an integral feature of the emotion process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lazarus | first1 = R. S. | year = 2006 | title = Emotions and Interpersonal Relationships: Toward a Person-Centered Conceptualization of Emotions and Coping | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 74 | issue = 1| pages = 9–46 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2005.00368.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are very few theories that emphasize the coping process for emotions as compared to the information available concerning the emotion itself.

There are numerous [[Coping (psychology)|styles of coping]], of which there has been a significant amount of research done, for example, [[avoidant]] versus approach. Coping with envy can be similar to coping with anger. The issue must be addressed cognitively in order to work through the emotion. According to the research done by [[Peter Salovey|Salovey]] and Rodin (1988), "more effective strategies for reducing initial envy appear to be stimulus focused rather than self-focused.".&lt;ref name="Salovey, P. 1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Salovey | first1 = P. | last2 = Rodin | first2 = J. | year = 1988 | title = Coping with envy and jealousy | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 15–33 | doi=10.1521/jscp.1988.7.1.15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salovey and Rodin (1988) also suggest "self-bolstering (e.g., "thinking about my good qualities") may be an effective strategy for moderating these self-deprecating thoughts and muting negative affective reactions".&lt;ref name="Salovey, P. 1988"/&gt; Further research needs to be done in order to better understand envy, as well as to help people cope with this emotion.

==Benefits==

Envy can be a painful emotion that can result from an unflattering social comparison of someone who is perceived to be a superior person. Aristotle defined envy as the pain a person experiences at the sight of another person’s good fortune. While envy is seen to be negative, it is the driving force behind the “keeping up with the Jones” philosophy. This means that there is always something to work toward, and to never become complacent with life.

	Envy can tell a person many things about themselves. It can tell them who they admire, what they want, and where they can grow. Being envious of another person can seem negative at that moment but has the potential to have positive effects in the future. For example, if a person envies someone who is successful it might drive them to work harder and to be more diligent which can in turn can attribute to their success in the long run.


==Envy and Adolescence==

Children show evidence of envy at an early age. Adults can be just as envious, however, they tend to be better at concealing the emotion. Envy plays a significant role in the development of adolescents. Comparing oneself is a universal aspect of human nature. No matter the age or culture, social comparison happens all over the globe. Comparison can range from physical attributes, material possessions and intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=festinger |first1=Leon |date=May 1, 1954 |pages=117-140 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/001872675400700202}}&lt;/ref&gt; However,children are more likely to envy over material objects such as shoes, video games, iPhone ect. Kids believe these material objects are correlated to their status.

 Social status has been found to have a strong connection with self-esteem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harter |first1=Susan |title=The Construction of the Self: Developmental and Sociocultural Foundations |date=2012 |publisher=Guilford Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;.An adolescents self-esteem is very fragile during early years and is heavily impacted by peer opinion.  If a child is comfortable with who they are and self-confident they are less likely to become envious of others material objects because they do not self-identify with materials. Material objects are not the only things that adolescents become envious over, however it is the most prevalent.

As children get older they develop stronger non-materialistic envy such as romantic relationships, physical appearance, achievement, and popularity.  Sometimes envious feelings are internalized in children, having a negative impact on their self-esteem. Envy comes from comparing, these comparisons can serve as a reminder that they have failed social norms and do not fit in with their peers. A feeling of inadequacy can arise and become destructive to a child’s happiness and cause further internal damage.

A child's identity is formed during their early years. Identity development is considered the central task during adolescence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erikson |first1=Erik |title=Identity Youth and Crisis |date=1968 |publisher=W.W. Norton and Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;. When children grow up understanding who they are, they are able to better define what their strengths and weaknesses are while comparing themselves to others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marcia |first1=James |title=Ego Identity}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Comparison can have two outcomes, it can be healthy in aiding in self-improvement or it can be unhealthy and result in envy/jealousy which can develop into depression. This is why self-exploration and identity development are critical in adolescent years.

It is important to identify healthy and unhealthy envy in a child at an early age. If a child is showing signs of unhealthy envy, it is best to teach the child productive ways to handle these emotions. It is much easier to teach a child how to control their emotions while they are young rather than allowing them to develop a habit that is hard to break when they are older.

==Envy and adulthood==
The things that drive people mad with envy changes throughout their lifetime. Studies have shown that the younger the person, the more likely they are to be envious of others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dahl |first1=Melissa |title=How Envy Changes as You Get Older |url=https://www.thecut.com/2015/11/how-envy-changes-as-you-get-older.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Adults under the age of 30 are more likely to experience envy compared to those 30 years and older. However, what people become envious over differs across adulthood. 

Younger adults, under the age of 30, have been found to envy others social status, relationships, and attractiveness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dahl |first1=Melissa |title=How Envy Changes as You Get Older |url=https://www.thecut.com/2015/11/how-envy-changes-as-you-get-older.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This starts to fade when a person hits there 30's, typically, at this point in life the person begins to accept who they are as an individual and compare themselves to others less often. However, they still envy others, just over different aspects in life, such as, career or salary &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dahl |first1=Melissa |title=How Envy Changes As You Get Older |url=https://www.thecut.com/2015/11/how-envy-changes-as-you-get-older.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Studies have shown a decrease in envy as a person ages, however, envious feelings over money was the only thing that consistently increased as a person got older &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dahl |first1=Melissa |title=How Envy Changes as You Get Older |url=https://www.thecut.com/2015/11/how-envy-changes-as-you-get-older.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

As a person ages, they begin to accept their social status. Nonetheless, envious feelings will be present throughout a persons life. It is up to the individual on whether they will let these envious feelings motivate or destroy them.
== Narcissists ==
Individuals with [[narcissistic personality disorder]] are often envious of others or believe others are envious of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/narcissisticpd.htm Narcissistic personality disorder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108003738/http://behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/narcissisticpd.htm |date=2010-01-08 }} - [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [[American Psychiatric Association]] (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Masterson|Masterson, James F.]] Why Is It Always About You? : The Seven Deadly Sins of Narcissism (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In philosophy ==
[[Aristotle]] (in [[Rhetoric]]) defined envy (φθόνος ''phthonos'') "as the pain caused by the good fortune of others",&lt;ref name="Pedrick "&gt;{{cite book|last=Pedrick|first=Victoria|author2=Oberhelman, Steven M.|year=2006|title=The Soul of Tragedy: Essays on Athenian Drama|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-0-226-65306-8|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Page:The ethics of Aristotle.djvu/68|2.7.1108b1-10]]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] defined it as "a reluctance to see our own well-being overshadowed by another's because the standard we use to see how well off we are is not the intrinsic worth of our own well-being but how it compares with that of others" (in [[Metaphysics of Morals]]).

== Religious views ==

=== In Buddhism ===
{{see also|Irshya}}

In Buddhism, the term [[irshya]] is commonly translated as either envy or jealousy. ''Irshya'' is defined as a state of mind in which one is highly agitated to obtain wealth and honor for oneself, but unable to bear the excellence of others.

The term ''[[mudita]]'' (sympathetic joy) is defined as taking joy in the good fortune of others. This virtue is considered the [[Antidote (Buddhism)|antidote]] to envy and the opposite of [[schadenfreude]].

Both in the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]] there are various descriptions of envy and events related to it, mostly with a dramatic outcome.

Envy is one of the [[Seven deadly sins]] in [[Roman Catholicism]]. In the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'' envy is said to be the motivation behind [[Cain and Abel|Cain]] murdering his brother, [[Cain and Abel|Abel]], as Cain envied Abel because God favored Abel's sacrifice over Cain's.

=== In Hinduism ===
"One who does not envy but is a compassionate friend to all ... such a devotee is very dear to Me." - [[Lord Krishna]] in the [[Bhagavad Gita]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20120116154250/http://vedabase.net/bg/12/13-14/en Chapter 12, Verse 15.]

In [[Hinduism]], envy is considered a disastrous emotion. Hinduism maintains that anything which causes the mind to lose balance with itself leads to misery. This concept is put forth in the epic [[Mahabharata]], wherein [[Duryodhana]] launches the [[Kurukshetra war]] out of envy of the perceived prosperity of his cousins. He is known to have remarked:

"Father! The prosperity of the [[Pandavas]] (cousins) is burning me deeply! I cannot eat, sleep or live in the knowledge that they are better off than me!"

Thus, Hinduism teaches that envy can be overcome simply by recognizing that the man or woman who is the object of one's envy is merely enjoying the fruits of their past karmic actions and that one should not allow such devious emotions to take control of their mind, lest they suffer the same fate as the antagonists of the [[Mahabharata]].

=== In Islam ===
In [[Islam]], envy (Hassad حسد in Arabic) is an impurity of the heart and can destroy one's good deeds.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} One must be content with what God has willed and believe in the justice of the creator. A Muslim should not allow his envy to inflict harm upon the envied person. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

[[Muhammad]] said, "Do not envy each other, do not hate each other, do not oppose each other, and do not cut relations, rather be servants of Allah as brothers. It is not permissible for a Muslim to disassociate from his brother for more than three days such that they meet and one ignores the other, and the best of them is the one who initiates the salaam." Sahih al-Bukhari [Eng. Trans. 8/58 no. 91], Sahih Muslim [Eng. Trans. 4/1360 no. 6205, 6210]

A Muslim may wish for himself a blessing like that which someone else has, without wanting it to be taken away from the other person. This is permissible and is not called hasad. Rather, it is called ghibtah.

"There is to be no envy except in two cases: (towards) a person to whom Allah has granted wisdom, and who rules by this and teaches it to the people, and (towards) a person to whom Allah has granted wealth and property along with the power to spend it in the cause of the Truth." [Al-Bukhaari &amp; Muslim]

=== In Judaism ===
In Judaism (in the Hebrew Bible 'jealousy', is a key feature of God's personality – He is furious in jealousy (for His own people's undivided worship).  YeHoVaH is jealous for His own.  {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}
The God of Israel is, "slow to anger and great in compassion" (Exodus 34:6) but when His jealousy and anger had accumulated there was an outburst of punishment. (Exodus 34:6; Numbers 14:18; Psalm 103:8; Ps 86:15; Ps 145:8; Jonah 4:2; Nahum 1:3; Nehemiah 9:17; Joel 2:13  etc.)
While jealousy is branded as a negative and unwanted emotion generally in society today and also in Christianity, which had developed out of Judaism, in the Biblical (so-called Old Testament) context it is a strong aspect of God's character and therefor not a flawed characteristic – unlike envy, which God does denounce. (Exodus 20:14; Deuteronomy 5:9 and verse18)  
We envy people when we want what they have.  We are jealous when we want to keep for ourselves what belongs exclusively to us.  Therefore we see the frightening permission God gave husbands who became jealous of their wives, to make them take a curse upon themselves, in case they had slept with another man while they belonged to their husband. (Numbers 5:11 – 31)
This points to the intimacy and exclusivity He is interested in, from His own people.  Ephraim 'committed harlotry' against YHVH and thereby defiled the nation of Israel.  Therefore He withdrew Himself from them, to their detriment:  "Woe to those when I depart from them!" (Hosea 9:12), He warns.  "They will cry to YHVH, but he will hide His face from them". (Micah 3:4)  A wounded Lover speaking.  "You paid, but were not paid; for your harlotry. Therefore, oh harlot, hear the Word of YHVH:  I shall set My jealousy against you and they will deal furiously with you." (Ezekiel 23:25)
YHVH showed Ezekiel how the people in Jerusalem set up 'an image that provokes jealousy'.  (Ezekiel 8:11, 12,  1 Kings 14:22, 2 Chronicles 14:2)
God also loves like a jealous lover:  He told Moses to make a breastplate for Aaron the priest, to wear when he goes into the Most Holy Place.  On the breastplate he had to display the names of all the tribes of Israel, so He could see it whenever Aaron went in to work where YHVH's Presence was (Exodus 28:29).  Somewhere else He says, I have your name engraved in the palm of My hand.  (Isaiah 49:16)
The God of Israel wants with His people a marriage of faithfulness, fairness, kindness and compassion – and that they should know Him.  (Hosea 2:21,22)
He is even jealous for the land itself, the land of Israel.  (Joel 2:18)
"I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy..  YHVH will yet comfort Zion and will yet choose Jerusalem..  For I will be to her a wall of fire all around; and the glory in her midst." (Zechariah 1:14, 17, Zechariah 2:9)
The Hebrew Bible says Judah provoked YHVH to jealousy with all their sins and their false gods. (1 Kings 14:22)  There is a notable difference in meaning between jealousy (of something that is one's own) and envy (which is covetousness of another one's possessions). (Exodus 20: 14; Proverbs 27:4)

== Cultural references ==
In English-speaking cultures, envy is often associated with the color [[green]], as in "green with envy", and [[yellow]].&lt;ref name="Eva Heller 2000 pg. 33"&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur- effets et symboliques'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Yellow is the color of ambivalence and contradiction; a color associated with optimism and amusement; but also with betrayal, duplicity, and jealousy.&lt;ref name="Eva Heller 2000 pg. 33"/&gt; The phrase "green-eyed monster" refers to an individual whose current actions appear [[Motivation|motivated]] by jealousy not envy. This is based on a line from Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]''. Shakespeare mentions it also in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' when Portia states: "How all the other passions fleet to air, as doubtful thoughts and rash embraced despair and shuddering fear and green-eyed jealousy!"

The character [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Envy|Envy]] from [[Fullmetal Alchemist]] series is one of the seven homunculi named after the seven deadly sins.

The character of Zelena on ABC's ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', takes on the title "The Wicked Witch of the West" after envy itself dyes her skin in the episode "It's Not Easy Being Green".

In the [[parable]] "Garden of Statues",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shonmehta.com/2014/08/garden-of-statues_10.html |title= Garden of Statues }}&lt;/ref&gt; a character goes mad with envy because of all the attention his sculptor neighbor is getting.

In [[Nelson W. Aldrich Jr.|Nelson W. Aldrich Jr.'s]] ''Old Money'', he states that people who suffer from a case of malicious envy are blind to what good things they already have, thinking they have nothing, causing them to feel emptiness and despair.&lt;ref name="Hacker, Diana 1996. p. 23"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6068">In [[optics]], the '''Ewald–Oseen extinction theorem''', sometimes referred to as just "extinction theorem", is a theorem that underlies the common understanding of scattering (as well as refraction, reflection, and diffraction). It is named after [[Paul Peter Ewald]] and [[Carl Wilhelm Oseen]], who proved the theorem in crystalline and isotropic media, respectively, in 1916 and 1915.&lt;ref name=born_and_wolf&gt;{{Citation|author=[[Max Born|Born, Max]]|author2=[[Emil Wolf|Wolf, Emil]]|title=Principles of Optics (7th ed.)|publisher=Cambridge University Press|place=Cambridge|year=1999|page=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oV80AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the theorem applied to scattering by an isotropic dielectric objects in free space. The scope of the theorem was greatly extended to encompass a wide variety of bianisotropic media.&lt;ref name=lakhtakia&gt;{{Citation|last=Lakhtakia|first=Akhlesh|year=2017|title=The Ewald-Oseen Extinction Theorem and the Extended Boundary Condition Method, in: The World of Applied Electromagnetics|publisher=Springer|place=Cham, Switzerland|pages=481-513|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-58403-4_19|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-58403-4_19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

An important part of optical physics theory is starting with microscopic physics—the behavior of atoms and electrons—and using it to ''derive'' the familiar, macroscopic, laws of optics. In particular, there is a derivation of how the [[refractive index]] works and where it comes from, starting from microscopic physics. The Ewald–Oseen extinction theorem is one part of that derivation (as is the [[Lorentz–Lorenz equation]] etc.).

When light traveling in vacuum enters a transparent medium like glass, the light slows down, as described by the [[index of refraction]]. Although this fact is famous and familiar, it is actually quite strange and surprising when you think about it microscopically. After all, according to the [[superposition principle]], the light in the glass is a superposition of:
* The original light wave, and
* The light waves emitted by each of the atoms in the glass.
(Remember, light has an electric field that pushes atoms back and forth, which causes the atoms to emit [[dipole radiation]].)

Individually, each of these waves travels at the speed of light in vacuum, ''not'' at the (slower) speed of light in glass. Yet when the waves are added up, they surprisingly create ''only'' a wave that travels at the slower speed.

The Ewald–Oseen extinction theorem says that the light emitted by the atoms has a component traveling at the speed of light in vacuum, which exactly cancels out ("extinguishes") the original light wave. Additionally, the light emitted by the atoms has a component which looks like a wave traveling at the slower speed of light in glass. Altogether, the ''only'' wave in the glass is the slow wave, consistent with what we expect from basic optics.

A more complete description can be found in Classical Optics and its Applications, by Masud Mansuripur.&lt;ref name=mansuripur&gt;{{Citation|last=Mansuripur|first=Masud|year=2009|title=Classical Optics and its Applications (2nd ed.)|publisher=Cambridge University Press|place=Cambridge|page=209|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nrkfmf4RizIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA168#v=onepage&amp;f=false|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511803796.019|arxiv=1507.05234}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A  proof of the classical theorem can be found in Principles of Optics, by Born and Wolf.&lt;ref name=born_and_wolf/&gt;, and that of its extension has been presented by [[Akhlesh Lakhtakia]].&lt;ref name=lakhtakia/&gt;

== Extinction lengths and tests of special relativity ==

The characteristic "extinction length" of a medium is the distance after which the original wave can be said to have been completely replaced. For visible light, traveling in air at sea level, this distance is approximately 1&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name=fox62&gt;{{Citation|author=[[J. G. Fox|Fox, J.G.]]|title=Experimental Evidence for the Second Postulate of Special Relativity|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=30|issue=1|year=1962|pages=297–300|doi=10.1119/1.1941992|postscript=.|bibcode=1965AmJPh..33....1F }}&lt;/ref&gt; In interstellar space, the extinction length for light is 2 light years&lt;ref name=brecher&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Brecher, K.|title=Is the speed of light independent of the velocity of the source|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=39|year=1977|pages=1051–1054|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.39.1051|postscript=.|bibcode=1977PhRvL..39.1051B|issue=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At very high frequencies, the electrons in the medium can't "follow" the original wave into oscillation, which lets that wave travel much further:  for 0.5 MeV gamma rays, the length is 19&amp;nbsp;cm of air and 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm of Lucite, and for 4.4 GeV, 1.7 m in air, and 1.4&amp;nbsp;mm in carbon.&lt;ref name=filippas_and_fox&gt;{{cite journal|last=Filippas|first=T.A.|author2=[[J.

[[Special relativity]] predicts that the speed of light in vacuum is independent of the velocity of the source emitting it. This widely believed prediction has been occasionally tested using astronomical observations.&lt;ref name=fox62/&gt;&lt;ref name=brecher/&gt; For example, in a binary star system, the two stars are moving in opposite directions, and one might test the prediction by analyzing their light.  (See, for instance, the [[De Sitter double star experiment]].)  Unfortunately, the extinction length of light in space nullifies the results of any such experiments using visible light, especially when taking account of the thick cloud of stationary gas surrounding such stars.&lt;ref name=fox62 /&gt;  However, experiments using X-rays emitted by binary pulsars, with much longer extinction length, have been successful.&lt;ref name=brecher /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8984">{{about|the existentialist phrase coined by Jean-Paul Sartre|the [[transcendent theosophy]] founder|Mulla Sadra}}

The proposition that '''existence precedes essence''' ({{lang-fr|l'existence précède l'essence}}) is a central claim of [[existentialism]], which reverses the traditional philosophical view  that the [[essence]] (the nature) of a thing is more fundamental and immutable than its [[existence]] (the mere fact of its being).&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Timaeus''; Aristotle, ''Metaphysics''; St Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa contra Gentiles'', Pars 3:1, ''Summa Theologiae'', Pars 1:1, etc. Analysis of "existence before essence" in Etienne Gilson, ''The Christian Philosophy of Saint Thomas Aquinas'', Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; To existentialists, human beings&amp;mdash;through their [[consciousness]]&amp;mdash;create their own values and determine a meaning for their life because the human being does not possess any inherent [[Identity (social science)|identity]] or [[Value (ethics)|value]]. That identity or value must be created by the individual. By posing the acts that constitute them, they make their existence more significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} (Dictionary) "L'existencialisme" - see "l'identité de la personne"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Encyclopédie de la jeunesse, 1979, p.567&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea can be found in the works of philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''Philosophical Fragments'', 1844.&lt;/ref&gt; but was explicitly formulated by philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] in the 20th century. The three-word formula originated in his 1945&lt;ref&gt;The lecture was delivered on Monday, October 29, 1945, although not published until 1946. "Existentialism is a Humanism." trans. Carol Macomber, preface by Arlene Elkaïm-Sartre, ed. John Kulka (New Haven: Yale, 2007), p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; lecture "[[L'existentialisme est un humanisme|Existentialism Is a Humanism]]",&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; though antecedent notions can be found in [[Heidegger|Heidegger's]] ''[[Being and Time]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, in ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' (1943), credits a slightly longer version of the claim to Heidegger: "Now freedom has no essence.  It is not subject to any logical necessity; we must say of it what Heidegger said of the ''Dasein'' in general: 'In it existence precedes and commands essence.'"  However, Sartre gives no page reference for this citation.  In ''Being and Time'', Heidegger writes: "The 'essence' of human-being lies in its existence." ("Das 'Wesen' des Daseins liegt in seiner Existenz", ''Sein und Zeit'', p. 42.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sartre's view==
The [[Sartre]]an claim is best understood in contrast to an established principle of [[metaphysics]]{{dubious|date=April 2012}} that ''essence'' precedes ''existence'', i.e. a typical claim for this traditional thesis would be that man is essentially selfish, or that he is a rational being.

To Sartre,  "existence precedes essence" means that a [[Personality development|personality]] is not built over a previously designed model or a precise purpose, because it is the human being who [[free will|chooses]] to engage in such enterprise. While not denying the constraining conditions of human existence, he answers to [[Spinoza]] who affirmed that man is determined by what surrounds him. Therefore, to Sartre an [[oppression|oppressive situation]] is not intolerable in itself, but once regarded as such by those who feel oppressed the situation ''becomes'' intolerable. So by projecting my intentions onto my present condition, "It is I who freely transform it into action". When he said that "the world is a [[mirror]] of my [[Political freedom|freedom]]", he meant that the world obliged me to react, to overtake myself. It is this overtaking of a present constraining situation by a project to come that Sartre names [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]]. He added that "we are condemned to be free".&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}}

When it is said that man defines himself, it is often perceived as stating that man can "wish" to be something – anything, a bird, for instance – and then be it. According to Sartre's account, however, this would be a kind of [[Bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]]. What is meant by the statement is that man is (1) defined only insofar as he acts and (2) that he is responsible for his actions. To clarify, it can be said that a man who acts cruelly towards other people is, by that act, defined as a cruel man and in that same instance, he (as opposed to his genes, for instance) is defined as being responsible for being this cruel man. Of course, the more positive therapeutic aspect of this is also implied: You can choose to act in a different way, and to be a good person instead of a cruel person. Here it is also clear that since man can choose to be either cruel or good, he is, in fact, neither of these things ''essentially''.&lt;ref&gt;Catalano p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

To claim that existence precedes essence is to assert that there is no such predetermined essence to be found in humans, and that an individual's essence is defined by the individual through how that individual creates and lives his or her life. As Sartre puts it in his [[Existentialism is a Humanism]]: "man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world – and defines himself afterwards".&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, ''Existentialism is a humanism''&lt;/ref&gt;

Existentialism tends to focus on the question of human existence and the conditions of this existence. What is meant by existence is the concrete life of each individual, and their concrete ways of being in the world. Even though this concrete individual existence must be the primary source of information in the study of people, certain conditions are commonly held to be "endemic" to human existence. These conditions are usually in some way related to the inherent meaninglessness or absurdity of the earth and its apparent contrast with our pre-reflexive lived lives which normally present themselves to us as meaningful. A central theme is that since the world "in-itself" is absurd, that is, not "fair", then a meaningful life can at any point suddenly lose all its meaning. The reasons why this happens are many, ranging from a tragedy that "tears a person's world apart", to the results of an honest inquiry into one's own existence. Such an encounter can make a person mentally unstable, and avoiding such instability by making people aware of their condition and ready to handle it is one of the central themes of existentialism. [[Albert Camus]], for instance, famously claimed in ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus|Le Mythe de Sisyphe]]'' that "there is only one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide".&lt;ref&gt;Camus, ''The Myth of Sisyphus''&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from these "psychological" issues, it is also claimed that these encounters with the absurd are where we are most in touch with our condition as humans. Such an encounter cannot be without philosophical significance, and existentialist philosophers derive many metaphysical theories from these encounters. These are often related to [[self|the self]], [[consciousness]] and [[free will|freedom]] as well as the nature of meaning.

{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2017}}
'''Eye-gouging''' is a serious offence in [[rugby union]] where a player uses hands or fingers to inflict pain in an opponent's eyes. The game's laws refer to it as ''"contact with eyes or the eye area of an opponent"'' but such incidents are usually referred to as "[[eye-gouging]]" among players and in the media.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news |title=Eye gouging: war is declared on rugby's ‘ultimate sin’ |first=Mark |last=Souster |newspaper=The Times (London) |date=11 January 2010 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/rugby_union/article6982910.ece }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

The laws of rugby union, as written by [[World Rugby]], define foul play as: "''Anything a player does within the playing enclosure that is against the letter and spirit of the Laws of the Game. It includes obstruction, unfair play, repeated infringements, dangerous play and misconduct which is prejudicial to the Game".''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/EN/laws/3/10/91/during-the-match/foul-play/definitions/#clause_91|title=Laws of the Game Rugby Union 2010, Law 10 Definitions |publisher = [[World Rugby|International Rugby Board]] (now World Rugby) |accessdate = 27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, they state that ''"A player must not do anything that is dangerous to the opponent"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/EN/laws/3/10/95/method-of-playing-the-match/foul-play/dangerous-play-and-misconduct/#clause_95|title=Laws of the Game Rugby Union 2010, Law 10.4|publisher = International Rugby Board|accessdate = 29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WR Regulations provide for punishment for contact with eyes or the eye area of an opponent.&lt;ref name="REG17"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.irb.com/mm/document/lawsregs/0/regulation17090730_8711.pdf|title= REGULATION 17. ILLEGAL AND/OR FOUL PLAY AND MISCONDUCT|publisher= ''[[World Rugby|International Rugby Board]]''|accessdate= 29 April 2010|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120609160719/http://www.irb.com/mm/document/lawsregs/0/regulation17090730_8711.pdf|archivedate= 9 June 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this is usually called "[[eye-gouging]]" by the [[Mass media|media]], fans and players, the term "gouging" is not used in World Rugby's laws or regulations, which do list degrees of gravity of the offence. World Rugby themselves have used the term in a 2009 statement, when the body was known as the International Rugby Board (IRB): "The IRB are firmly of the view there is no place in rugby for illegal or foul play and the act of eye-gouging is particularly heinous".&lt;ref name="Scotsman"&gt;{{cite news |title=IRB review signals intent to get tough on gouging |first=Andrew |last=Baldock |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=2 July 2009 |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/rugby/IRB-review-signals-intent-to.5421507.jp }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scales of the offence ===

Following two separate high-profile [[Test match (rugby union)|test match]] incidents, involving [[Schalk Burger]] and [[Sergio Parisse]], during the same week in June 2009, the IRB stated that it would review the sanction structure for this type of offence "in order to send out the strongest possible message that such acts will not be tolerated".&lt;ref name="Scotsman"/&gt;

The regulations provide a scale of seriousness.&lt;ref name="REG17"/&gt; As of the most recent revision to the regulations in 2016, separate scales are provided for "contact with the ''eyes''" and "contact with the ''eye area''", where the "eyes" are defined as all tissues within and covering the orbital cavity, including eyelids, and "eye area" covers areas outside the orbital cavity but in close proximity to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldrugby.org/handbook/regulations/reg-17/appendix-1 |title=Appendix 1: World Rugby Sanctions for Foul Play (Regulation 17) |work=World Rugby Handbook |publisher=[[World Rugby]] |date=22 April 2016 |accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Contact with the eyes
* Lower end: up to 12-week ban.
* Mid range: up to 18-week ban.
* Top end: greater than 24-week ban.

;Contact with the eye area
* Lower end: up to 4-week ban.
* Mid range: up to 8-week ban.
* Top end: greater than 12-week ban.

The maximum sanction for either is a 156-week (3 year) ban.

In [[rugby sevens|sevens]], bans are officially expressed in numbers of matches instead of weeks, reflecting the schedule of the Sevens World Series for [[World Rugby Sevens Series|men]] and [[World Rugby Women's Sevens Series|women]], as well as other major events for sevens teams.

== History ==
In the early days of rugby, eye gouging was commonplace and happened mainly in the [[scrum (rugby)|scrum]] due to a lack of control by [[referee (rugby)|referees]] and the opportunity the scrum offered for players to commit foul play due to the way the scrum is formed.&lt;ref name=process&gt;{{cite book | first = Eric | last = Dunning  | title = The Sports Process: A Comparative and Developmental Approach | publisher = Human Kinetics | location =  | year = 1996| isbn = 0880116242  | page = 54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rising amount of foul play involving eye gouging eventually lead to the founding of the [[Rugby Football Union]] to control rugby and to reduce the amount of foul play.&lt;ref name=process /&gt; Eye-gouging then began to disappear from the early game as the laws of rugby became stricter due to English [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] students starting to play rugby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Iain | last = Macintosh  | title = Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Rugby But Were too Afraid to Ask | publisher = A&amp;C Black | location =  | year = 2012| isbn = 1408174367  | page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After then foul play including eye-gouging became largely unspoken of and rugby authorities often ignored complaints of eye-gouging. This was due to authorities expecting players to deal with it themselves as it was claimed to be part of the nature of the game and was often viewed as a joke.&lt;ref name=thesis /&gt; In 1992, [[Richard Loe]] made contact with [[Greg Cooper (rugby union)|Greg Cooper]]'s eyes while playing in the [[National Provincial Championship]] and was banned for nine months after a nine-hour deliberation by the [[New Zealand Rugby Union]]'s judicial committee.&lt;ref name=Loe&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby-union-loe-banned-for-gouging-1556429.html |title=Loe banned for gouging |publisher=The Independent |date=9 October 1992 |accessdate=8 August 2011 |location=London |first=Steve |last=Bale}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was viewed by observers as a turning point in attitudes towards eye-gouging and punishments for eye-gouging became stricter.&lt;ref name=thesis&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=Ph.D |chapter=6.2 |title=A discourse analysis of institutionalised logic in the field of New Zealand rugby 1985 and 2005  |author= |last=Harris |first=David |year=2008 |publisher=Massey University |docket= |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Daniell, a New Zealand [[Lock (rugby union)|lock]] who played for nearly a decade in France, eye gouging is fairly common and considered "a way of life" in French rugby, where it is known as "la fourchette".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher |first=Brendan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/france/4945001/Eye-gouging-just-a-way-of-life-in-French-rugby.html |title=Eye-gouging just a way of life in French rugby |publisher=Telegraph |date=5 March 2009 |accessdate=8 August 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanctions for eye-gouging have been subject to debate by journalists and commentators, depending on interpretation by presiding disciplinary officers.&lt;ref name=baffling&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter |last=Bills |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/news-comment/peter-bills-varying-punishments-for-eyegouging-are-baffling-2269508.html |title=Varying punishments for eye-gouging are baffling |publisher=The Independent |date=19 April 2011 |accessdate=8 August 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Punishments in the Northern Hemisphere are seen by some journalists as being harsher than those for similar offenses seen in Southern Hemisphere countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/may/04/alan-quinlan-gouging-british-lions | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Paul | last=Rees | title=Alan Quinlan fights gouging citation with Lions tour on the line | date=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South African national rugby union team|South African national]] coach, [[Peter de Villiers]] stated he did not believe that an eye-gouging incident for which Schalk Burger was yellow carded merited any punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/8122733.stm | work=BBC News | first=Simon | last=Austin | title=Burger 'gouge' angers Fitzgerald | date=27 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RUeyegouge.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Clarence Harding after a severe eye gouge]]

As well as many cases involving professional rugby union, the case of Clarence Harding, an amateur player, has received considerable coverage due to the extreme damage caused to his eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1247241/Rugby-player-blinded-eye-eye-gouging-attack.html|title=Police investigate rugby match gouging incident which left player blind in one eye|accessdate=11 May 2010 | location=London | work=Daily Mail|date=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2017|failed=y|reason=Per RfC, DAILY MAIL is unreliable and should be removed or replaced.}}&lt;ref name='Blind eyes must not be turned'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetrugby.com/story/0,25883,16016_6136583,00.html|title=Blind eyes must not be turned|work=Planet Rugby|accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/8663226.stm|title=Player blinded in one eye after gouge speaks out |accessdate=11 May 2010 | work=BBC News | date=6 May 2010 |first=Alastair |last=Eykyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harding was left without sight in his right eye and can no longer play rugby, and the injury has affected his livelihood and has since had the eye removed due to the pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-13029096| title= Maidstone RFC 'tarnished' by RFU eye gouging ruling| work=BBC.co.uk | author= | date=10 April 2011 | accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Iles, the player alleged to have injured Harding, was found not guilty by the [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] as they could not determine which player was responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-11827032 | title= Disappointment as Kent rugby player cleared of gouging | work=BBC.co.uk | author= | date=24 November 2010 | accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Maidstone RFC]] were fined [[Pound sterling|£]]2,000 and deducted 50 points after being found "guilty of conduct prejudicial to the interests of the game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-12179402 | title= Maidstone RFC fined over eye gouging | work=BBC.co.uk | author= | date=13 January 2011 | accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was also investigated by [[Kent Police]] but no criminal charges were brought against Maidstone or Iles due to insufficient evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-12001599 | work=BBC News | title=Kent club Maidstone RFC charged over eye gouging | date=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 October 2010, [[Gavin Quinnell]] suffered an eye injury during a game between [[Llanelli RFC|Llanelli]] and [[Cross Keys RFC|Cross Keys]], from which he lost the sight in his left eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/welsh/9056033.stm | title=Gavin Quinnell loses sight in his left eye  | work=BBC.co.uk | author= | date=7 October 2010 | accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was under investigation by the [[Welsh Rugby Union]] and [[Gwent Police]], with the police arresting the perpetrator. However, the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] advised against prosecution, leading to the dropping of criminal charges, and the WRU eventually dropped its citing complaint, to the self-described shock of the Quinnell family, one of the most prominent in Welsh rugby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/welsh/12964924.stm |title=Quinnell family's shock over sight loss ruling |work=BBC Sport |date=4 April 2011 |accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An incident in the [[2011 Rugby World Cup Final|Rugby World Cup Final]] on 23 October 2011 led the IRB to reevaluate its disciplinary procedures. [[France national rugby union team|France]] centre [[Aurélien Rougerie]] apparently made contact with the eyes of [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] captain [[Richie McCaw]], who would later state that he had been "half-blinded" for the last few minutes of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/newzealand/rugby/story/155634.html |title=McCaw breaks eye-gouge silence |work=ESPN Scrum |date=6 December 2011 |accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original camera angles provided by host broadcaster Sky NZ showed no apparent foul play, and Rougerie was not cited within the 36-hour window allowed by IRB rules at the time. Three days after the match, new Sky NZ footage emerged which showed Rougerie apparently raking his hand across McCaw's eyes. The IRB could not cite Rougerie outside the 36-hour window, and the exception allowed in its rules for "exceptional circumstances" did not include the emergence of new evidence. In December 2011 the IRB announced that it would reconsider its procedures to address similar situations in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/france/rugby/story/153864.html |title=IRB ponder disciplinary overhaul |work=ESPN Scrum |date=8 November 2011 |accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High-profile cases ===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45909">The '''fairness doctrine''' of the United States [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), introduced in 1949, was a policy that required the holders of [[broadcast license]]s both to present controversial issues of public importance and to do so in a manner that was—in the FCC's view—honest, equitable, and balanced. The FCC eliminated the policy in 1987 and removed the rule that implemented the policy from the ''Federal Register'' in August 2011.&lt;ref name="Finally"&gt;{{cite web|last=Boliek|first=Brooks|title=FCC finally kills off fairness doctrine|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0811/61851.html|work=Politico|date=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fairness doctrine had two basic elements: It required broadcasters to devote some of their airtime to discussing controversial matters of [[public interest]], and to air contrasting views regarding those matters. Stations were given wide latitude as to how to provide contrasting views: It could be done through news segments, public affairs shows, or editorials. The doctrine did not require equal time for opposing views but required that contrasting viewpoints be presented. The demise of this FCC rule has been considered by some to be a contributing factor for the rising level of [[Polarization (politics)|party polarization]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;E. Patterson, Thomas. "The News Media: Communicating Political Images." We the People. 10th ed. McGraw-Hill Education, 2013. 336. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rendall |first=Steve |title=The Fairness Doctrine: How We Lost it, and Why We Need it Back |publisher=Extra! |date=January 1, 2005 |url=http://fair.org/extra/the-fairness-doctrine/ |accessdate=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main agenda for the doctrine was to ensure that viewers were exposed to a diversity of viewpoints. In 1969 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] upheld the FCC's general ''right'' to enforce the fairness doctrine where channels were limited. But the courts did not rule that the FCC was ''obliged'' to do so.&lt;ref name=RedLion&gt;[http://www.epic.org/free_speech/red_lion.html ''Red Lion Broadcasting Co.'' v. ''FCC''], decided June 8, 1969, also at {{Ussc|395|367|1969}} (Excerpt from Majority Opinion, III A; Senate report cited in footnote 26). Justice [[William O. Douglas]] did not participate in the decision, but there were no concurring or dissenting opinions.&lt;/ref&gt; The courts reasoned that the scarcity of the broadcast spectrum, which limited the opportunity for access to the airwaves, created a need for the doctrine.

The fairness doctrine is not the same as the [[equal-time rule]]. The fairness doctrine deals with discussion of controversial issues, while the equal-time rule deals only with political candidates.

==Origins==
In 1938, a former Yankee Network employee named Lawrence J. Flynn challenged the license of John Shepard III's WAAB in Boston, and also lodged a complaint about WNAC. Flynn asserted that these stations were being used to air one-sided political viewpoints and broadcast attacks (including editorials) against local [and federal] politicians that Shepard opposed. The FCC requested that Shepard provide details about these programs, and to appease the commission, the Yankee Network agreed to drop the editorials.  But Flynn created a company called Mayflower Broadcasting and tried to get the FCC to award him WAAB's license; however, the FCC refused. Instead, in 1941, the commission made a ruling that came to be known as the Mayflower Decision which declared that radio stations, due to their public interest obligations, must remain neutral in matters of news and politics, and they were not allowed to give editorial support to any particular political position or candidate.

In 1949, the FCC’s Editorializing Report&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Commission in the Matter of Editorializing by Broadcast Licensees'', 13 F.C.C. 1246 [1949].&lt;/ref&gt; repealed the [[Mayflower Doctrine]], which had forbidden editorializing on the radio since 1941, and laid the foundation for the Fairness Doctrine by reaffirming the FCC's holding that licensees must not use their stations “for the private interest, whims or caprices [of licensees], but in a manner which will serve the community generally.”&lt;ref&gt;''Report ... Licensees'', 13 F.C.C. 1246, 1248-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = America's Battle for Media Democracy: The Triumph of Corporate Libertarianism and the Future of Media Reform|last = Pickard|first = Victor|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2015|isbn = 9781107694750|location = New York, NY|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC Report established two forms of regulation on broadcasters: to provide adequate coverage of public issues, and to ensure that coverage fairly represented opposing views.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, D.L. (1996), ''The Federal Communications Commission, the broadcast industry, and the fairness doctrine 1981–1987'', New York: University Press of America, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The second rule required broadcasters to provide reply time to issue-oriented citizens. Broadcasters could therefore trigger Fairness Doctrine complaints without editorializing. The commission required neither of the Fairness Doctrine's obligations before 1949. Until then broadcasters had to satisfy only general “public interest” standards of the Communications Act.&lt;ref&gt;Donahue, H.(1988). ''The battle to control broadcast news''. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine remained a matter of general policy and was applied on a case-by-case basis until 1967,&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum Opinion and Order, 8 F.C.C.2d 721 (August 7, 1967), which codified the personal attack doctrine and implemented provisions with respect to political editorials from Times-Mirror Broadcasting Co., 40 F.C.C. 531, 538 (1962); codified as 32 Fed. Reg. 10303 at para. 4 (1967). This was amended twice in Memorandum Opinion and Order, 9 F.C.C.2d 539 (1967) and Memorandum Opinion and Order, 12 F.C.C.2d 250 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; when certain provisions of the doctrine were incorporated into FCC regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Donald P. Mullally, “The Fairness Doctrine: Benefits and Costs”, ''The Public Opinion Quarterly'' 33, no. 4 (Winter 1969–1970): 577.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1969 textbook case, the [[United States courts of appeals]], in an opinion written by [[Warren Burger]], directed the FCC to revoke Lamar Broadcasting's licence for television station [[WLBT]] due to the station's segregationist politics and ongoing censorship of NBC network news coverage of the US civil rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2008/3/6/the_fcc_censorship_legendary_media_activist The FCC &amp; Censorship: Legendary Media Activist [[Everett Parker]] on the Revocation of WLBT’s TV License in the 1960s for Shutting Out Voices of the Civil Rights Movement], [[Democracy Now]], March 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application of the doctrine by the FCC ==

In 1974, the Federal Communications Commission stated that the [[United States Congress|Congress]] had delegated it the power to mandate a system of “access, either free or paid, for person or groups wishing to express a viewpoint on a controversial public issue...” but that it had not yet exercised that power because licensed broadcasters had “voluntarily” complied with the “spirit” of the doctrine. It warned that: {{cquote|Should future experience indicate that the doctrine [of 'voluntary compliance'] is inadequate, either in its expectations or in its results, the Commission will have the opportunity—and the responsibility—for such further reassessment and action as would be mandated.&lt;ref&gt;''In the Matter of the Handling of Public Issues Under the Fairness Doctrine and the Public Interest Standards of the Communications Act'', 48 F.C.C.2d 1 (F.C.C. 1974); 39 Fed. Reg. 26.372, 26.374 (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;}}  

In one landmark case, the FCC argued that [[teletext]] was a new technology that created soaring demand for a limited resource, and thus could be exempt from the fairness doctrine. The Telecommunications Research and Action Center (TRAC) and [[Media Access Project]] (MAP) argued that teletext transmissions should be regulated like any other airwave technology, hence the Fairness Doctrine was applicable (and must be enforced by the FCC). In 1986, Judges [[Robert Bork]] and [[Antonin Scalia]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] concluded that the Fairness Doctrine did apply to teletext but that the FCC was not required to apply it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altlaw.org/v1/cases/419289 ''Telecommunications Research and Action Center'' v. ''FCC'', 801 F.2d 501 (D.C. Cir. 1986)] retrieved on August 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; In a 1987 case, ''[[Meredith Corporation|Meredith Corp.]] v. FCC'', two other judges on the same court declared that Congress did not mandate the doctrine and the FCC did not have to continue to enforce it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altlaw.org/v1/cases/421421 ''Meredith Corp.'' v.

==Decisions of the United States Supreme Court==

In ''[[Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC]]'', {{Ussc|395|367|1969}}, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld (by a vote of 8-0) the constitutionality of the fairness doctrine in a case of an on-air personal attack, in response to challenges that the doctrine violated the [[First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]]. The case began when journalist [[Fred J. Cook]], after the publication of his ''Goldwater: Extremist of the Right'', was the topic of discussion by [[Billy James Hargis]] on his daily Christian Crusade radio broadcast on [[WGCB-TV|WGCB]] in [[Red Lion, Pennsylvania]]. Mr. Cook sued arguing that the fairness doctrine entitled him to free air time to respond to the personal attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Joyce: [http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:YDRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FAE0731EA2EE1CD&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&amp;req_dat=11ECDBF131F44C689BB0EDBA11D99EE0 “His call for a reply set up historic broadcast ruling; Fred J. Cook, whose book was attacked on Red Lion radio station WGCB in 1964, died recently at age 92.”] ''York Daily Record'' (Pennsylvania), May 6, 2003, retrieved on August 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Although similar laws are unconstitutional when applied to the press, the Court cited a [[United States Senate|Senate]] report (S. Rep. No. 562, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 8-9 [1959]) stating that radio stations could be regulated in this way because of the limited public airwaves at the time. Writing for the Court, Justice [[Byron White]] declared:{{cquote|A license permits broadcasting, but the licensee has no constitutional right to be the one who holds the license or to monopolize a radio frequency to the exclusion of his fellow citizens. There is nothing in the First Amendment which prevents the Government from requiring a licensee to share his frequency with others.... It is the right of the viewers and listeners, not the right of the broadcasters, which is paramount.&lt;ref name=RedLion /&gt;}}
The Court warned that if the doctrine ever restrained speech, then its constitutionality should be reconsidered.

However, in the case of ''[[Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo]]'', {{Ussc|418|241|1974}}, [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Warren Burger]] wrote (for a unanimous court):{{cquote|Government-enforced right of access inescapably dampens the vigor and limits the variety of public debate.}}
This decision differs from ''Red Lion'' v. ''FCC'' in that it applies to a newspaper, which, unlike a broadcaster, is unlicensed and can theoretically face an unlimited number of competitors.

In 1984, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress could not forbid editorials by non-profit stations that received grants from the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] (''FCC v. [[League of Women Voters]] of California'', {{Ussc|468|364|1984}}). The Court's 5-4 majority decision by [[William J. Brennan, Jr.]] stated that while many now considered that expanding sources of communication had made the fairness doctrine's limits unnecessary: {{cquote|We are not prepared, however, to reconsider our longstanding approach without some signal from Congress or the FCC that technological developments have advanced so far that some revision of the system of broadcast regulation may be required. (footnote 11)}}
After noting that the FCC was considering repealing the fairness doctrine rules on editorials and personal attacks out of fear that those rules might be "chilling speech", the Court added: {{cquote|Of course, the Commission may, in the exercise of its discretion, decide to modify or abandon these rules, and we express no view on the legality of either course. As we recognized in Red Lion, however, were it to be shown by the Commission that the fairness doctrine '[has] the net effect of reducing rather than enhancing' speech, we would then be forced to reconsider the constitutional basis of our decision in that case. (footnote 12)&lt;ref&gt;The quotation is from Section III C of ''Red Lion'' v. ''FCC'' {{Ussc|395|367|1969}}. Justice Brennan's opinion was joined by Justices [[Thurgood Marshall]], [[Harry Blackmun]], [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.|Lewis Powell]] and [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]. Dissenting opinions were written or joined by Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] and Justices [[William Rehnquist]], [[Byron White]] and [[John Paul Stevens]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Revocation ==
=== Basic doctrine ===
In 1985, under FCC Chairman [[Mark S. Fowler]], a communications attorney who had served on Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign staff in 1976 and 1980, the FCC released its report on ''General Fairness Doctrine Obligations''&lt;ref&gt;''General Fairness Doctrine Obligations of Broadcast Licensees'', Report, 50 Fed. Reg. 35418 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; stating that the doctrine hurt the public interest and violated [[free speech]] rights guaranteed by the [[First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|First Amendment]]. The Commission could not, however, come to a determination as to whether the doctrine had been enacted by Congress through its 1959 Amendment to Section 315 of the [[Communications Act of 1934|Communications Act]]. 

In response to the 1986 ''Telecommunications Research &amp; Action Center v. F.C.C.'' decision,&lt;ref&gt;801 F.2d 501 (D.C. Cir. 1986), ''reh'g denied'', 806 F.2d 1115 (D.C. Cir. 1986), ''cert. denied'', 107 S.Ct. 3196 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[99th Congress]] directed&lt;ref&gt;Making Continuing Appropriations for Fiscal Year 1987, P.L. 99-500. See also, ''Conference Report to Accompany H.J.Res. 738'', H.Rept. 99-1005. 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; the FCC to examine alternatives to the Fairness Doctrine and to submit a report to Congress on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40009.pdf | publisher=Congressional Research Service | date=13 July 2011 | accessdate=10 May 2016 |title=Fairness Doctrine: History and Constitutional Issues|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, in ''Meredith Corporation v. F.C.C.'' the case was returned to the FCC with a directive to consider whether the doctrine had been “self-generated pursuant to its general congressional authorization or specifically mandated by Congress.”&lt;ref&gt;809 F.2d 863 (D.C. Cir. 1987) at 872.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The FCC opened an inquiry inviting public comment on alternative means for administrating and enforcing the Fairness Doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;''Inquiry into Section 73.1910 of the Commission’s Rules and Regulations Concerning Alternatives to the General Fairness Doctrine Obligations of Broadcast Licensees in MM Docket No. 97-26'', 2 FCC Rcd 1532 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in its 1987 report, the alternatives—including abandoning a case-by-case enforcement approach, replacing the doctrine with open access time for all members of the public, doing away with the [[personal attack rule]], and eliminating certain other aspects of the doctrine—were rejected by the FCC for various reasons.&lt;ref&gt;''In the Matter of Inquiry into Section 73.1910 of the Commission’s Rules and Regulations Concerning Alternatives to the General Fairness Doctrine Obligations of Broadcast Licensees''. 2 FCC Rcd 5272 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 5 August 1987, under FCC Chairman [[Dennis R. Patrick]], the FCC abolished the doctrine by a 4-0 vote, in the ''Syracuse Peace Council'' decision,&lt;ref&gt;''In re Complaint of Syracuse Peach Council against Television Station WTVH Syracuse, New York'', 2 FCC Rcd 5043 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; which was upheld by a panel of the Appeals Court for the D.C. Circuit in February 1989, though the Court stated in their decision that they made "that determination without reaching the constitutional issue."&lt;ref name="syacuse_fcc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://openjurist.org/867/f2d/654/syracuse-peace-council-v-federal-communications-commission | title=867 F. 2d 654 - Syracuse Peace Council v. Federal Communications Commission | publisher=Openjurist | date=10 February 1989 | accessdate=7 December 2014 | quote=Under the "fairness doctrine," the Federal Communications Commission has, as its 1985 Fairness Report explains, required broadcast media licensees (1) "to provide coverage of vitally important controversial issues of interest in the community served by the licensees" and (2) "to provide a reasonable opportunity for the presentation of contrasting viewpoints on such issues." Report Concerning General Fairness Doctrine Obligations of Broadcast Licensees, 102 F.C.C. 2d 143, 146 (1985). In adjudication of a complaint against Meredith Corporation, licensee of station [[WTVH]] in Syracuse, New York, the Commission concluded that the doctrine did not serve the public interest and was unconstitutional. Accordingly it refused to enforce the doctrine against Meredith. Although the Commission somewhat entangled its public interest and constitutional findings, we find that the Commission's public interest determination was an independent basis for its decision and was supported by the record. We uphold that determination without reaching the constitutional issue.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC suggested in ''Syracuse Peace Council'' that because of the many media voices in the marketplace, the doctrine be deemed unconstitutional, stating that: {{cquote|The intrusion by government into the content of programming occasioned by the enforcement of [the Fairness Doctrine] restricts the journalistic freedom of broadcasters ... [and] actually inhibits the presentation of controversial issues of public importance to the detriment of the public and the degradation of the editorial prerogative of broadcast journalists.}}

At the 4-0 vote, Chairman Patrick said:{{cquote|We seek to extend to the electronic press the same First Amendment guarantees that the print media have enjoyed since our country's inception.&lt;ref name="vote1987"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hershey, Jr. |first1=Robert D. |title=F.C.C.

[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/20/business/regulator-unregulated-dennis-patrick-fcc-another-man-who-loves-free-markets.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1987, Congress attempted to preempt the FCC decision and codify the Fairness Doctrine,&lt;ref&gt;The Fairness in Broadcasting Act of 1987, S. 742 &amp; H.R. 1934, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; but the legislation was vetoed by President [[Ronald Reagan]]. Another attempt to revive the doctrine in 1991 was stopped when President [[George H.W. Bush]] threatened another veto.&lt;ref&gt;Val E. Limburg, [http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/F/htmlF/fairnessdoct/fairnessdoct.htm "Fairness Doctrine"], April 27, 2009, [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fowler said in February 2009 that his work toward revoking the Fairness Doctrine under the Reagan Administration had been a matter of principle (his belief that the Doctrine impinged upon the First Amendment), not partisanship. Fowler described the White House staff raising concerns, at a time before the prominence of conservative talk radio and during the preeminence of the [[Big Three television networks]] and PBS in political discourse, that repealing the policy would be politically unwise. He described the staff's position as saying to Reagan: {{cquote|The only thing that really protects you from the savageness of the three networks{{mdash}}every day they would savage Ronald Reagan{{mdash}}is the Fairness Doctrine, and Fowler is proposing to repeal it!&lt;ref name="Fowler-Levin;"&gt;[http://citadelcc.vo.llnwd.net/o29/network/Levin/MP3/levin02162009.mp3 The Mark Levin Show], February 16, 2009 (a 26-Megabyte [[MP3]] file), from about 17 minutes 15 seconds into the broadcast to 25 min. 45 sec.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Corollary rules ===
Two corollary rules of the doctrine, the [[personal attack rule]] and the "political editorial" rule, remained in practice until 2000. The "personal attack" rule applied whenever a person (or small group) was subject to a personal attack during a broadcast. Stations had to notify such persons (or groups) within a week of the attack, send them transcripts of what was said and offer the opportunity to respond on-the-air. The "political editorial" rule applied when a station broadcast editorials endorsing or opposing candidates for public office, and stipulated that the unendorsed candidates be notified and allowed a reasonable opportunity to respond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INFORMATION NEEDS OF COMMUNITIES: The policy and regulatory landscape|url=https://transition.fcc.gov/osp/inc-report/INoC-26-Broadcast.pdf|website=transition.fcc.gov|publisher=[[FCC]]|accessdate=22 August 2017|pages=277-278|format=pdf|date=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit]] ordered the FCC to justify these corollary rules in light of the decision to repeal the Fairness Doctrine. The FCC did not provide prompt justification so both corollary rules were repealed in October 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leweke|first1=Robert W.|title=Rules Without a Home: FCC Enforcement of the Personal Attack and Political Editorial Rules|journal=Communication Law and Policy|date=1 October 2001|volume=6|issue=4|pages=557–576|doi=10.1207/S15326926CLP0604_02|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15326926CLP0604_02|accessdate=22 August 2017|issn=1081-1680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition ===
The Fairness Doctrine has been strongly opposed by prominent [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] who view it as an attack on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights and property rights. Editorials in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[The Washington Times]]'' in 2005 and 2008 said that Democratic attempts to bring back the Fairness Doctrine have been made largely in response to conservative [[talk radio]].&lt;ref&gt;

In the same year, the Broadcaster Freedom Act of 2007 was proposed in the Senate by Senators Coleman with 35 co-sponsors (S.1748) and [[John Thune]] (R-SD) with 8 co-sponsors (S.1742)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-s1742/show Broadcaster Freedom Act of 2007], Open Congress Foundation, retrieved on November 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and in the House by Republican Representative [[Mike Pence]] (R-[[Indiana|IN]]) with 208 co-sponsors (H.R. 2905).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h2905/show Broadcaster Freedom Act of 2007, introduced February 1, 2005, "To prevent the Federal Communications Commission from repromulgating the fairness doctrine"], Open Congress Foundation, retrieved on November 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It provided that: {{cquote|The Commission shall not have the authority to prescribe any rule, regulation, policy, doctrine, standard, or other requirement that has the purpose or effect of reinstating or repromulgating (in whole or in part) the requirement that broadcasters present opposing viewpoints on controversial issues of public importance, commonly referred to as the `Fairness Doctrine', as repealed in General Fairness Doctrine Obligations of Broadcast Licensees, 50 Fed.

Neither of these measures came to the floor of either house.

On August 12, 2008, FCC Commissioner [[Robert M. McDowell]] stated that the reinstitution of the Fairness Doctrine could be intertwined with the debate over [[network neutrality]] (a proposal to classify network operators as [[common carrier]]s required to admit all Internet services, applications and devices on equal terms), presenting a potential danger that [[net neutrality]] and Fairness Doctrine advocates could try to expand content controls to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Poor, [http://www.businessandmedia.org/articles/2008/20080812160747.aspx "FCC Commissioner: Return of Fairness Doctrine Could Control Web Content"], August 13, 2008, Business &amp; Media Institute&lt;/ref&gt; It could also include "government dictating content policy".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eyeblast.tv/Public/Video.aspx?rsrcID=34016 See also [http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-288134A1.pdf Commissioner McDowell's speech to the Media Institute] in January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;     The conservative [[Media Research Center]]'s Culture &amp; Media Institute argued that the three main points supporting the Fairness Doctrine — media scarcity, liberal viewpoints being censored at a corporate level, and public interest — are all myths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultureandmedia.com/specialreports/2008/Fairness_Doctrine/CMI_FairnessDoctrine_Single.pdf Culture &amp; Media Institute report on The Fairness Doctrine.] - accessed August 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, [[Barack Obama]]'s press secretary wrote that Obama (then a Democratic U.S. Senator from Illinois and candidate for President): {{cquote|Does not support reimposing the Fairness Doctrine on broadcasters ... [and] considers this debate to be a distraction from the conversation we should be having about opening up the airwaves and modern communications to as many diverse viewpoints as possible. That is why Sen. Obama supports media-ownership caps, [[network neutrality]], [[public broadcasting]], as well as increasing minority ownership of broadcasting and print outlets.&lt;ref&gt;John Eggerton, [http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6573406.html "Obama Does Not Support Return of Fairness Doctrine"], ''[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]'', June 25, 2008, retrieved on October 30, 2008, citing an e-mail from Obama's press secretary, Michael Ortiz.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On February 16, 2009, Mark Fowler said: {{cquote|I believe as President Reagan did, that the electronic press{{mdash}}and you're included in that{{mdash}}the press that uses air and electrons, should be and must be as free from government control as the press that uses paper and ink, ''Period''.&lt;ref name="Fowler-Levin;"/&gt;}}

In February 2009, a White House spokesperson said that President Obama continued to oppose the revival of the Doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=White House: Obama Opposes 'Fairness Doctrine' Revival |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100days/2009/02/18/white-house-opposes-fairness-doctrine/ |work=Fox News |date=February 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[111th Congress]] (January 2009 to January 2011), the [[Broadcaster Freedom Act of 2009]] (S.34, S.62, H.R.226) was introduced to block reinstatement of the Doctrine.  On February 26, 2009, by a vote of 87-11, the Senate added that act as an amendment to the [[District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009]] (S.160),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate Backs Amendment to Prevent Fairness Doctrine Revival |work=FOXNews.com |date=February 26, 2009 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/02/26/demint-tries-prevent-fairness-doctrine-revival/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228062416/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/02/26/demint-tries-prevent-fairness-doctrine-revival/ |archivedate=February 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [a bill which later passed the Senate 61-37, but not the House of Representatives].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/feb/26/senate-votes-give-dc-full-house-vote/|title=Senate votes to give D.C. full House vote|last=Warren|first=Timothy|date=February 26, 2009|publisher=[[The Washington Times]]|accessdate=February 26, 2009}} The Senate roll call is [https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00073 here].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Associated Press]] reported that the vote on the Fairness Doctrine [[rider (legislation)|rider]] was: {{cquote|In part a response to conservative radio talk show hosts who feared that Democrats would try to revive the policy to ensure liberal opinions got equal time.}}
The AP report went on to say that President Obama had no intention of reimposing the doctrine, but Republicans (led by Sen. [[Jim DeMint]], R-[[South Carolina|SC]]) wanted more in the way of a guarantee that the doctrine would not be reimposed.&lt;ref&gt;Senate bars FCC from revisiting Fairness Doctrine The Associated Press, February 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suggested alternatives===

{{distinguish|Unfairness doctrine}}

Media reform organizations such as [[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]] feel that a return to the Fairness Doctrine is not as important as setting stronger station ownership caps and stronger "public interest" standards enforcement (with funding from fines given to [[public broadcasting]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepress.net/files/talk_radio.pdf|title="The Structural Imbalance of Talk Radio", Free Press, Center for American Progress|author=|date=|website=freepress.net|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Accurate labeling rules ====
Under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, the FTC requires that all 'consumer commodities' bear a label with an accurate 'statement identifying the commodity'.  If revenue-generating commercial broadcasts (whether by radio, tv, or internet) are a 'consumer commodity', then they must be accurately labeled.  That would seem to preclude 'News' that is not genuine, 'Opinion' that is not the author's actual opinion, or 'Analysis' that is not at least arguably analytical.  Note that in general the FTC only has authority over commercial aspects (pertaining to revenue) rather than speech.

===Public opinion===
In an August 13, 2008 telephone poll released by [[Rasmussen Reports]], 47% of 1,000 likely voters supported a government requirement that broadcasters offer equal amounts of liberal and conservative commentary, while 39% opposed such a requirement. In the same poll, 57% opposed and 31% favored requiring Internet [[website]]s and [[blog]]gers that offer political commentary to present opposing points of view. By a margin of 71%-20% the respondents agreed that it is "possible for just about any political view to be heard in today’s media" (including the Internet, newspapers, [[cable TV]] and [[satellite radio]]), but only half the sample said they had followed recent news stories about the Fairness Doctrine closely. (The [[margin of error]] was 3%, with a 95% confidence interval.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/47_favor_government_mandated_political_balance_on_radio_tv 47% Favor Government Mandated Political Balance on Radio, TV], Rasmussen Reports press release, Thursday, August 14, 2008 and [http://rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_20082/pt_survey_toplines/august_2008/toplines_fairness_doctrine_august_13_2008 Toplines - Fairness Doctrine - August 13, 2008] (Questions and answers from the survey).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal revocation==
In June 2011, the Chairman and a subcommittee chairman of the [[House Energy and Commerce Committee]], both Republicans, said that the FCC, in response to their requests, had set a target date of August 2011 for removing the Fairness Doctrine and other "outdated" regulations from the FCC's rulebook.&lt;ref&gt;Gautham Nagesh, [http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/168807-fcc-sets-august-target-for-striking-fairness-doctrine FCC sets August target for striking Fairness Doctrine], "Hillicon Valley" blog, ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', June 28, 2011, quoting Republican Representatives [[Fred Upton]] (R-Michigan), Chairman of the Energy &amp; Commerce Committee, and [[Greg Walden]] (R-Oregon), Chairman of its Telecommunications Subcommittee.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 22, 2011, the FCC voted to remove the rule that implemented the Fairness Doctrine, along with more than 80 other rules and regulations, from the ''[[Federal Register]]'' following an executive order by President Obama directing a "government-wide review of regulations already on the books" to eliminate unnecessary regulations.&lt;ref name="Finally"/&gt;

'''Functional psychology''' or '''functionalism''' refers to a psychological philosophy that considers mental life and behaviour in terms of active adaptation to the person's environment.&lt;ref&gt;Gary R. VandenBos, ed., ''APA Dictionary of Psychology'' (2006). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it provides the general basis for developing psychological theories not readily testable by controlled experiments or [[applied psychology]].

Functionalism arose in the U.S. in the late 19th century as an alternative to [[Structuralism (psychology)|structuralism]].&lt;ref name="EBO functionalism"&gt;"functionalism." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/222123/functionalism Encyclopædia Britannica Online]. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 08 Mar. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While functionalism never became a formal school, it built on structuralism's concern for the anatomy of the mind and led to greater concern over the functions of the mind, and later to [[behaviourism]].&lt;ref name="EBO functionalism"/&gt;

==History==
{{original research|date=July 2012}}
{{see also|History of psychology#Early American Psychology}}
Functionalism &lt;ref name="termfunctionalism"&gt; [http://www.iep.utm.edu/functism/ Functionalism]. "Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt; was a philosophy opposing the prevailing [[structuralism (psychology)|structuralism]] of psychology of the late 19th century. [[Edward Titchener]], the main structuralist, gave psychology its first definition as a science of the study of mental experience, of [[consciousness]], to be studied by trained [[introspection]].

[[William James]] is considered to be the founder of functional psychology. But he would not consider himself as a functionalist, nor did he truly like the way science divided itself into schools. [[John Dewey]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Harvey A. Carr]], and especially [[James Rowland Angell]] were the main proponents of functionalism at the [[University of Chicago]]. Another group at [[Columbia University|Columbia]], including notably [[James McKeen Cattell]], [[Edward L. Thorndike]], and [[Robert S. Woodworth]], were also considered functionalists and shared some of the opinions of Chicago's professors. [[Egon Brunswik]] represents a more recent, but Continental, version. The functionalists retained an emphasis on conscious experience.

[[Behaviourist]]s also rejected the method of introspection but criticized functionalism because it was not based on controlled experiments and its theories provided little predictive ability.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} [[B.F. Skinner]] was a developer of behaviourism. He did not think that considering how the mind affects behaviour was worthwhile, for he considered behaviour simply as a learned response to an external stimulus. Yet, such behaviourist concepts tend to deny the human capacity for random, unpredictable, sentient decision-making, further blocking the functionalist concept that human behaviour is an active process driven by the individual. Perhaps, ''a combination'' of both the functionalist and behaviourist perspectives provides scientists with the most empirical value,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} but, even so, it remains philosophically (and physiologically) difficult to integrate the two concepts without raising further questions about human behaviour.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} For instance, consider the interrelationship between three elements: the human environment, the human autonomic nervous system (our fight or flight muscle responses), and the human somatic nervous system (our voluntary muscle control). The behaviourist perspective explains a mixture of both types of muscle behaviour, whereas the functionalist perspective resides mostly in the somatic nervous system. It can be argued that all behavioural origins begin within the nervous system, prompting all scientists of human behaviour to possess basic physiological understandings, something very well understood by the functionalist founder William James.

==Contemporary descendants==
[[Evolutionary psychology]] is based on the idea that knowledge concerning the function of the psychological phenomena affecting human evolution is necessary for a complete understanding of the human psyche. Even the project of studying the evolutionary [[consciousness#Biological function and evolution|functions of consciousness]] is now an active topic of study. Like evolutionary psychology, James's functionalism was inspired by [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of natural selection.&lt;ref name="Psychology"&gt;Schacter, Daniel L.; Wegner, Daniel &amp; Gilbert, Daniel. 2007. ''Psychology''. Worth Publishers. pp. 26–7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OSH gift card.jpg|thumb|Gift card for a US hardware store]]

A '''gift card''' (also known as '''gift certificate''' in North America, or '''gift voucher''' or '''gift token''' in the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/gift-token|title=GIFT TOKEN {{!}} meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge Dictionary|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a prepaid [[stored-value card|stored-value money card]] usually issued by a [[retailer]] or [[bank]] to be used as an alternative to cash for purchases within a particular store or related businesses. Gift cards are also given out by retailers and marketers as part of a promotion strategy, to entice the recipient to come in or return to the store, and at times such cards are called '''cash cards'''. Gift cards are generally redeemable only for purchases at the relevant retail premises and cannot be cashed out, and in some situations may be subject to an expiry date or fees. Visa and MasterCard credit cards produce generic gift cards which need not be redeemed at particular stores, and which are widely used for '''cashback''' marketing strategies. A feature of these cards is that they are generally anonymous and are disposed of when the stored value on a card is exhausted.

From the purchaser's point of view, a gift card is a [[gift]], given in place of an object which the recipient may not need, when the giving of cash as a present may be regarded as socially inappropriate. In the [[United States]], gift cards are highly popular, ranking in 2006 as the second-most given gift by consumers and the most-wanted gift by women, and the third-most wanted by males.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Gift cards have become increasingly popular as they relieve the donor of selecting a specific gift.&lt;ref name=consumer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/02/gift_cards_congress.html |title=Congress Considers New Gift Card Rules |author=James R.

==History==
{{refimprove|date=June 2012}}
The first giftcard using a payments infrastructure was introduced by [[Neiman Marcus]] in late 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buchanan|first=Matt|title=The Vile History of Gift Cards and How They Came to Destroy Christmas|url=https://gizmodo.com/5434783/the-vile-history-of-gift-cards-and-how-they-came-to-destroy-christmas|publisher=Gizmodo|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;, though [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster Entertainment]] was the first company to do so at a wide scale&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CES/NaBANCO introduces stored value card technology; Blockbuster Video is first merchant partner|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/CES%2fNaBANCO+introduces+stored+value+card+technology%3b+Blockbuster...-a017787941|publisher=Business Wire|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, test-marketing them in 1995 and launching them around the country the next year. In the beginning, the Blockbuster giftcard replaced gift certificates that were being counterfeited with recently introduced color copiers and color printers. Blockbuster's first giftcard transactions were processed by what was then Nabanco of [[Sunrise, Florida]]. Nabanco was the developer of the first third-party platform for the processing of giftcards using existing payment infrastructure.

Neiman Marcus and Blockbuster were later followed by the [[Mobil]] gas card which initially offered prepaid phone value provided by [[MCI Inc.|MCI]]. [[Kmart]] was next with the introduction of the Kmart Cash Card which in the early generations provided prepaid phone time with [[AT&amp;T]]. Later this feature was dropped as it was not profitable for both Kmart and Mobil. The Kmart Mags Pangilinan Cash Card was the first replacement for cash returns when a shopper did not have a receipt for a gift. This practice of giving a cash card in place of cash for non-receipted returns is common place today with most merchants. From these early introductions, other retailers began to adapt a giftcard program to replace their gift certificate programs.

==Function and types==
[[File:Gift card assortment.jpg|300px|thumb|right|An assortment of gift cards, many from U.S. national retailers such as [[Best Buy]], [[Target Corporation|Target]] and [[Home Depot]].]]
A gift card may resemble a [[credit card]] or display a specific theme on a plastic card the size of a credit card. The card is identified by a specific number or code, not usually with an individual name, and thus could be used by anybody. They are backed by an on-line electronic system for authorization. Some gift cards can be reloaded by payment and can be used thus multiple times.

Cards may have a [[barcode]] or [[magnetic strip]], which is read by an electronic credit card machine. Many cards have no value until they are sold, at which time the cashier enters the amount which the customer wishes to put on the card. This amount is rarely stored on the card but is instead noted in the store's database, which is crosslinked to the card ID. Gift cards thus are generally not [[stored-value card]]s as used in many public transport systems or library photocopiers, where a simplified system (with no network) stores the value only on the card itself. To thwart counterfeiting, the data is [[encrypted]]. The magnetic strip is also often placed differently than on credit cards, so they cannot be read or written with standard equipment. Other gift cards may have a set value and need to be activated by calling a specific number.

Gift cards can also be custom tailored to meet specific needs. By adding a custom message or name on the front of the card, it can make for an individualized gift or incentive to an employee to show how greatly they are appreciated.

Gift cards are divided into "open loop" or "network" cards and "closed loop" cards. The former are issued by banks or credit card companies and can be redeemed by different establishments, the latter by a specific store or restaurant and can be only redeemed by the issuing provider. The latter, however, tend to have fewer problems with card value decay and fees.&lt;ref name="consumerreports"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consumerreports.org/holiday-shopping/tips-for-giving-gift-cards/|title=Avoid gift card pitfalls|date=December 2007}} accessed 06-16-2008&lt;/ref&gt; In either case the giver would buy the gift card (and may have to pay an additional purchase or activation fee), and the recipient of the card would use the value of the card at a later transaction. A third form is the "hybrid closed loop" card where the issuer has bundled a number of closed loop cards; an example is free gift cards for a specific [[shopping mall|mall]].

Gift cards differ from [[scrip|gift certificate]]s, in that the latter are usually sold as a paper document with an authorized signature by a restaurant, store, or other individual establishment as a [[voucher]] for a future service; there is no electronic authorization. A gift certificate may or may not have an expiration date and generally has no administrative fees.

Bank-issued gift cards may be used in lieu of checks as a way to disburse [[rebate (marketing)|rebate]] funds. Some retailers use the gift card system for refunds in lieu of cash thereby assuring that the customer will spend the funds at their store.

A [[Charity gift card|Charity Gift Card]] allows the gift giver to make a charitable donation, and the gift recipient to choose a charity that will receive the donation.

===Mobile and virtual gift cards===

Mobile gift cards are delivered to mobile phones via [[email]] or [[SMS]] and phone apps allow users to carry only their cell phone. Benefits include tying them to a particular phone number and ease of distribution.

Virtual gift cards are delivered via e-mail to the recipient, the benefits being that they cannot be lost and that the consumer does not have to drive to the bricks and mortar location to purchase a gift card.

Other companies have introduced virtual gift cards that users redeem on their smartphones. As the merchant is not involved in the loop, it is considered a cash transfer rather than a traditional gift card.

==Pitfalls==
It has been argued that holiday giving destroys value due to mismatching gifts.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/magazine/07wwln_freak.t.html?ex=1325826000&amp;en=970d53de24147ae4&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss | author=Stephen J. Dubner and Steven D. Levitt | title=The Gift-Card Economy | date=January 7, 2007 | publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most efficient way to keep value in gifting would be to give cash; however, this is socially acceptable only within limits. Gift cards, to a degree, may overcome this problem but have certain pitfalls. Some feel that the absence of the thought of selecting a specific gift makes a gift card a worse choice than a poorly executed but individual gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/12/bad_gift.html | title=Bad Gift Better Than Gift Card, Says Philosopher | date=2006-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; New products in the gift card industry are evolving to tackle this "impersonal" pitfall of gift cards. New services launched by some service providers allows for customization and personalization of gift cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_45/b4057049.htm | work=BusinessWeek | title=Gift Cards with a Personal Touch | date=November 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gift cards have been criticized for the ability of the issuer to set rules that are detrimental to the purchaser or card recipient. For example, gift cards may be subject to an expiry date, administrative fees, restrictions on use, and absence of adequate protection in case of fraud or loss.&lt;ref name=consumer/&gt; Over time fees may render the value of a gift card zero. However, these issues have been addressed in recent years in some jurisdictions. In the [[United States]], many jurisdictions limit or prohibit all fees or expiration dates for gift cards. Further, because of the negative impact on sales that such policies can have, most merchants have adopted and even advertise a "no fee, no expiration" policy for their gift cards, whether or not state laws require it. In 2011, an estimated 2.5% of gift cards were subject to an expiration date and 2.7% to post-sale fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scripsmart.com/gift_card_report_2011 |title=ScripSmart 2011 Gift Card Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quarter of gift card recipients still have not spent gift cards a year after receiving them, according to a Consumer Reports survey. And a majority of people say they end up spending more than the value of the card once they get to the store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97016449 |title=Gift Card Warning: Check Retailer's Health |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event of the bankruptcy of the issuing retailer, the outstanding value on gift cards is considered [[unsecured debt]], and as such gift cards may become valueless.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97016449 | author=Tamara Keith | title=Gift Card Warning: Check Retailer's Health | date=2008-11-17 | publisher=[[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the company intends to continue trading, gift cards may be honoured even in bankruptcy.

Another issue regarding gift cards are the growing concerns from retailers and other businesses about what can be done to prevent gift cards from being exploited by fraudsters. Gift card information can either be stolen from their rightful owners by fraudsters or they can be purchased with stolen credit card information. In recent years, cybercriminals have increased their efforts to take advantage of fraudulent gift cards as they are simple to exploit with automated brute-force bot attacks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.csoonline.com/article/3196035/fraud/what-not-to-get-mom-for-mother-s-day.html | work=CSO Online | title=What Not To Get Mom For Mother's Day | date=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The most common form of gift card fraud is committed through the act of stealing card information for activated cards with an existing balance by attacking a retailer’s systems which store gift card data. Once a gift card has been compromised, the fraudster will then check the balance through online customer portals before using the funds or reselling on the secondary gift card market&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2017/03/17/prevent-fraud-brute-force-online-coupon-gift-card-attacks/| work=Digital Commerce 360 from Internet Retailer | title=How to prevent fraud from brute force online coupon and gift card attacks | date=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Redemption rate==
{{main article | breakage }}
Not all gift cards are redeemed. The card may be lost; there may be time decay (expiration and fees) or complex rules of redemption; the recipient may not be interested in the store that accepts the card or be under the false assumption that not using it will save money for the giver. It has been estimated that perhaps 10% of cards are not redeemed, amounting to a gain for retailers of about $8 billion in the United States in 2006.&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;

In 2012, over $100 billion in gift cards will be purchased in the United States, where over 20% of those gift cards will go unredeemed or unused. This has amassed a large opportunity in the secondary market, similar to the secondary ticket market in the early 2000s. Some companies have created a business in the secondary gift card market that allow consumers to sell their unused gift cards or buy discounted gift cards to their favorite brands. This has helped their users recoup their share of some $55 million per day that goes unredeemed in the United States every year, by turning their unused gift cards into cash.

==Regulations==

=== Canada ===
All Canadian provinces have legislations passed to ban expiry dates and fees collected on gift cards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.financialpost.com/2012/02/27/gift-cards-come-with-regulations/ Gift cards come with regulations]&lt;/ref&gt; However, provincial gift card legislations do not apply to sectors that are regulated under federal laws. For example, gift cards that resemble credit cards (i.e. with Visa, MasterCard or American Express branding) and phone cards are regulated by the federal government. Under the federal ''Prepaid Payment Products Regulations'', effective May 1, 2014, federally regulated gift cards may only charge maintenance fees under certain conditions, and may not set an expiry date for funds on those cards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/Eng/about/news/Pages/News-nouvelles.aspx?itemid=249 Prepaid Payment Products Regulations published in the Canada Gazette]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In the past, uniform standards concerning gift cards did not exist. This was set to change as an addendum to the [[Credit CARD Act of 2009]] directs the federal government to create consumer-friendly standards pertaining to gift cards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-627 Read The Bill: H.R. 627 [111th]. GovTrack.us. Retrieved on 2011-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, the new regulations prohibit retailers from setting expiration dates unless they are at least 5 years after the card’s date of issue or the date on which funds were last added to the card. In addition, retailers are no longer able to assess dormancy, inactivity, or service fees unless the card has been inactive for at least 12 months, and if fees are added after that period, the details of such fees must be clearly disclosed on the card. Additionally, retailers are unable to levy more than one fee per month. The new provisions took effect on August 22, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wkow.com/Global/story.asp?S=12188430 Fed issues new gift card regulations – WKOW 27: Madison, WI Breaking News, Weather and Sports]. Wkow.com (2010-03-23). Retrieved on 2011-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

Open loop cards are governed by rules of the [[Comptroller of the Currency]], however oversight has been criticized.&lt;ref name=consumer/&gt; Closed loop gift cards are subject to rules set by different state regulations, and issuing authorities vary widely in the rules they set for the consumer.&lt;ref name=consumer/&gt; Rules can be changed by the issuer without notifying the consumer.&lt;ref name=consumerreports/&gt;&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;

A '''green sport event''' is a sporting event that stresses utilizing greener resources. Fans can do their part by riding [[public transportation]] to the event. People are being more aware of many things, like using earth friendly [[paper products]], [[fertilizer]] and [[pesticides]].&lt;ref&gt;Zeller, Tom, Jr. "Getting Sports Events to Go Green." [[New York Times]] [New York, New York] 9 Aug. 2009, Energy Environment sec.: n. pag. Web. 5 Oct. 2009. &lt;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/10/business/energy-environment/10green.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Also see [[sustainable event management]] or event greening.

==Third dimension==

One week after the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) awarded the [[XVII Olympic Winter Games]] to Lillehammer, national, local and regional governments decided to make the Lillehammer Games a showcase for GREEN mega-events. More than 200 different projects with environmental aspects were carried out. And at IOC's 100&amp;nbsp;years celebration in Paris in 1994, environment was added as the Third Dimension to the Olympics in addition to Sport and Culture.

The legacy from Lillehammer has, in a global perspective, followed two paths:
- World Conferences on sport and environment, the first in Lillehammer in 1996
- Environmental requirements which have to be met by future bidders and organisers of Olympic Games.

===Target Center===
{{main|Target Center}}
:The [[Target Center]] home of the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] (NBA) has the 5th largest [[green roof]], and if the first arena to have a green roof. It collects rain water and regulates temperatures in both the summer and the winter. It has collected nearly 1&amp;nbsp;million gallons of rain water and it has diverted it into the [[Mississippi River]]. Also on the top of the roof there are different kinds of plants such as [[prairie coreopsis]], [[Fragaria|wild strawberry]], [[dotted blazing-star]], and [[Lupinus|lupine]].&lt;ref name="greensportsvenues"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greensportsvenues.com/2009092169/news/first-arena-green-roof-unveiled-at-target-center.php|title=First arena green roof unveiled at Target Center  &amp;#124; News|publisher=greensportsvenues.com|accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tokyo 2016 Olympics bid===
 {{main|Tokyo bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics}}
:[[Tokyo]] is not going to be the host of the 2016 olympics but the city was a candidate. They had said that if they were going to host it they would have the first carbon-minus games. A man-made island called [[Sea Forest]] off the Tokyo was going to be the place for the Olympic [[Cross country running|Cross-Country]], [[Rowing (sport)|Rowing]], [[Canoe]], [[Kayak]] and [[mountain bike]] and [[BMX]] competitions. Also they were going to have half a million trees planted on this island by 2016. [[U2]]'s lead singer [[Bono]] was one of the first people to plant a tree on this island. During this major planning stage was also the Vice Governor of Tokyo, [[Hideo Sugawara]], Beijing 2008 swimming medallist, [[Junichi Miyashita]], and thousands of Tokyo 2016 green supporters. Tokyo's carbon-minus plan was to install the use of [[solar energy|solar]], [[wind]] and other [[renewable energy sources]]. They were going to have faculty helping where ever they could all over the stadium. Low or [[zero-emission vehicle]]s are also includes in Tokyo 2016's plan.&lt;ref name="greensportsvenues2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greensportsvenues.com/2009092168/news/tokyo-pitches-carbon-minus-olympics-for-2016.php|title=Tokyo pitches carbon-minus Olympics for 2016 &amp;#124; News|publisher=greensportsvenues.com|accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Airlines Center ===
{{main|American Airlines Center}}
The [[American Airlines Center]] home of the [[Miami Heat]] (NBA) has been awarded [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED Certification]] for Existing Buildings: Operations &amp; Maintenance by the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] (USGBC), being one of two the first two to receive this award. The Center received the award on the same day as the Philips Arena in Atlanta. This center has committed to saving energy and water savings. They wish that they could be a lead to other sports venues becoming more "green" too.

====List of "green" features at the American Airline Center ====
::[[Green roofing materials]]: The arena’s solar reflective index is high enough that it reflects heat and reduces the energy needed to cool the building.
::[[Energy conservation|Energy consumption]]: The arena was built without a chilled water plant, which requires a lot of energy, therefore, there is much less energy consumption as the arena’s chilled water comes from an off-site source.
:: [[Water-efficient landscaping]]: All plants are high to medium drought resistant, and a “drip and soak” irrigation system (micro irrigation) runs under the surface delivering water directly to the roots and minimizing the amount of water evaporated by the sun.
::[[Underground parking]]: Reduces heat-trapping asphalt to trap heat, which is known to cause a “heat-island effect” which releases heat back into the atmosphere.
::[[Walk-off carpets]]: Trap dirt and contamination of arena guests to improve overall indoor air quality.&lt;ref name="greensportsvenues3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greensportsvenues.com/2009040866/news/american-airlines-leed.php|title=Joinng the LEED lineup: American Airlines Arena &amp;#124; News|publisher=greensportsvenues.com|accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators, clinicians, and research authors frequently analyze and discuss the effects and efficacy of this intervention as a whole, with the result that it is often difficult to attribute positive or negative outcomes to any of the specific techniques that contribute to guided meditation. Furthermore, the term "guided meditation" is frequently used interchangeably with the terms "guided imagery" and sometimes with "creative visualization" in [[popular psychology]] and [[Self help|self-help]] literature, and to a lesser extent in [[Scholarly method|scholarly]] and [[Scientific method|scientific]] publications. Consequently, understanding the nature, scope, application, and limitations of guided meditation requires it to be considered in context and relationship to the multiple techniques that are integral to its practice, allowing for variations in terminology.&lt;ref&gt;Astin, J.A., Shapiro, S.L., Eisenberg, D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4659">The '''H-Prize program''' is a series of [[inducement prize contest|inducement prizes]] intended to encourage research into the use of [[hydrogen]] as an [[energy carrier]] in a [[hydrogen economy]]. The program is sponsored by the [[United States Department of Energy]] and administered by the Hydrogen Education Foundation. In 2014, an H-Prize competition was launched to develop a small-scale hydrogen generation and refueling station for hydrogen [[fuel cell electric vehicle]]s. The prize, named the H2 Refuel H-Prize and worth $1 million, was awarded in January 2017, to the consortium "SimpleFuel". 

==Creation==
Legislation for the prize, introduced by Rep. [[Bob Inglis]], passed the [[United States House of Representatives]] in May 2006 as {{USBill|109|H.R.|5143}},&lt;ref&gt;[[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060602094041/http://www.house.gov/science/press/109/109-257.htm "House Overwhelmingly Passes Inglis H-Prize Bill"]&lt;/ref&gt; but did not receive a vote in the [[United States Senate]]. After being reintroduced by Rep. [[Dan Lipinski]] at the beginning of a new term in January 2007, it was eventually folded into the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]], which passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate and was then signed into law in December 2007.

The bill [[authorization bill|authorized]] $50 million in prize money, for the period from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2017. However, in order to be spent, these funds must also be included in Congress's annual [[appropriation bill]]s. The law provides for three categories of prizes:

*Four prizes of up to $1 million, awarded every two years for advances in hydrogen production, storage, distribution and utilization;
*One prize of up to $4 million, awarded two years to working prototypes of hydrogen vehicles which meet ambitious performance goals; and
*A $10 million grand prize, awarded only once during the program for a major technological breakthrough.

In October 2008, the [[Hydrogen Education Foundation]] of Washington, D.C. was selected to administer the H-Prize along with [[South Carolina Research Authority|SCRA]], a South Carolina research foundation.

== Prizes ==
In August 2009, the [[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy]] (EERE) of the U.S. Department of Energy announced a $1 million prize for innovative [[hydrogen storage]] materials which would be awarded in February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2009/08/26/E9-20552/initial-h-prize-competition-for-breakthrough-advances-in-materials-for-hydrogen-storage|title=Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 164 / Wednesday, August 26, 2009 / Notices|date=August 26, 2009|accessdate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the prize was never awarded as no competitor met the competition requirements.

In March 2014, EERE announced plans for a $1 million H2 Refuel H-Prize, and the Prize competition was launched in October 2014. The competition focused on developing small hydrogen refueling stations that can generate hydrogen from electricity or natural gas and dispense it to vehicles at least 1 kg at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://energy.gov/eere/articles/interested-hydrogen-and-fuel-cell-technologies-help-shape-h2-refuel-h-prize | title=Interested in Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies?

SimpleFuel was a consortium of three companies, PDC Machines, Ivys, Inc, and McPhy Energy North America. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/articles/energy-department-announces-simplefuel-winner-1-million-h2-refuel-h-prize | title=Energy Department Announces SimpleFuel Winner of the $1 Million H2 Refuel H-Prize | publisher=[[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy]] | date=19 January 2017 | accessdate=23 January 2018 | author=Sunita Satyapal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yoko Ono. Half-A-Room. 1967.jpg|thumb|''Half-A-Room'', MOMA, 1967.]]
'''''Half-A-Room''''' is a 1967 conceptual artwork by the Japanese artist [[Yoko Ono]].

==Work==
The work is made from various objects that have been cut in half and painted white. It was made with the help of Ono's second husband, [[Anthony Cox (producer)|Anthony Cox]], and some local art students. The piece was first displayed at Ono's 'Half-A-Wind' exhibition (also called 'Yoko Plus Me'&lt;ref name="Badman2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Keith Badman|title=The Beatles: Off the Record|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g9YFvAv6GrwC|date=9 December 2009|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-0-85712-045-8|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;) at the [[Lisson Gallery]] in West London in 1967. At the Lisson Gallery show the objects were accompanied by a row of glass bottles on a shelf with each bottle containing the words "Half a X" for each cut up object to represent their respective missing halves. The names in bottles was suggested by [[John Lennon]], with Ono recognizing his contribution semi-anonymously with the inclusion of the label "J.L." underneath the bottles.&lt;ref name="BeramBoriss-Krimsky2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nell Beram|author2=Carolyn Boriss-Krimsky|title=Yoko Ono: Collector of Skies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pCOWKp3LZ0C|date=1 February 2012|publisher=Abrams|isbn=978-1-61312-513-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{col-end|width=95%}}

''Half-a-Room'' was shown at Ono's exhibition from 10 November 2007 to 4 February 2008 at the Centro Cultural Banco do Brasil in São Paulo .&lt;ref name='AIU'&gt;{{cite web|title=Half-a-Room|url=http://www.a-i-u.net/art_news.html|publisher=AIU|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The work was shown at Ono's 1967 ''Half-a-Wind'' exhibition at the [[Lisson Gallery]] in Paddington, London, from 11 October to 14 November 1967.&lt;ref name='LissonEx'&gt;{{cite web|title=Half-A-Wind show|url=http://www.lissongallery.com/exhibitions/yoko-ono-half-a-wind-show|publisher=Lisson Gallery|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the exhibition was underwritten by [[John Lennon]]. Ono had been to see Lennon's friend [[Pete Shotton]], who was working for [[The Beatles]] company [[Apple Corps]], and had asked to borrow a few thousand pounds to fund the exhibition. Shotton told Ono that he "really not authorised to hand out two thousand quid like that" but upon asking Lennon, Shotton said that he "merely grunted the affirmative without further comment". Lennon later described the exhibition as all "beautifully cut in half and painted white...That was our first public appearance, but I didn't even go and see the show, I was too uptight".&lt;ref name="Badman2009"/&gt;

==Interpretation==
''Half-A-Room'' has been described by Ono as a response to her feeling at the time that "there was a half empty space in my life" as a result of the increasing estrangement of her and her second husband, [[Anthony Cox (producer)|Anthony Cox]]. Ono awoke one day and noticed that her Cox had not returned from a night out, and so the bed was half empty, and through this realised that there was "a half empty space in my life". The magazine ''[[Another Magazine]]'' wrote in 2015 that the piece "speaks to the pointlessness of material things without the human connection that gives them meaning; the result is a pure, painful representation of heartbreak that takes the breath away."&lt;ref name='AnOther15&gt;{{cite web|title=The Extraordinary Yoko Ono|url=http://www.anothermag.com/art-photography/7473/the-extraordinary-yoko-ono|publisher=[[Another Magazine]]|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional impact of the end of her relationship with Cox subsequently inspired Ono to make her piece ''[[Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting]]''.&lt;ref name=Guard14&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/13/yoko-ono-guggenheim-bilbao-conceptual-influence|title=Yoko Ono show at Guggenheim shines light on pioneering conceptual artist|date=13 March 2014|author=Jonathan Jones (journalist)|work=The Guardian|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the accompanying exhibition text ''Some Notes on the Lisson Gallery Show'', Ono wrote that "I think of this show as an elephant's tail. ...Life is only half a game. Molecules are always at the verge of half disappearing and half emerging. Somebody said I should also put half-a-person in the show. But we are halves already. It is sad that the air is the only thing we share. No matter how close we get to each other, there is always air between us. It is also nice that we share the air. No matter how far apart we are, the air links us".&lt;ref name='LissonHalf'&gt;{{cite web|title=Half-a-Room|url=http://www.lissongallery.com/50years/half-a-room-installation|publisher=Lisson Gallery|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an audio guide recorded for Ono's 2015 retrospective at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City, Ono said that "You see a room with little – a space between it. Instead of a room that's packed, you know, it has air between there. ...In those days, I still didn't have a life of just being alone. And then I thought, "This is a great one for a work of art to show to people that we're just half." Anyway, everything that I see here, the other half is invisible. And that other half may be something that we might see one day, but now we don't see it".&lt;ref name='MOMA'&gt;{{cite web|title=Half-a-Room|url=https://www.moma.org/explore/multimedia/audios/406/7262|publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]]|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ring theory]], a branch of [[abstract algebra]], an '''ideal''' is a special [[subset]] of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. Ideals generalize certain subsets of the [[integer]]s, such as the [[even numbers]] or the multiples of 3. Addition and subtraction of even numbers preserves evenness, and multiplying an even number by any other integer results in another even number;  these [[Closure (mathematics)|closure]] and absorption properties are the defining properties of an ideal.  An ideal can be used to construct a [[quotient ring]] similarly to the way that, in [[group theory]], a [[normal subgroup]] can be used to construct a [[quotient group]].

Among the integers, the ideals correspond one-for-one with the [[non-negative integer]]s: in this ring, every ideal is a [[principal ideal]] consisting of the multiples of a single non-negative number. However, in other rings, the ideals may be distinct from the ring elements, and certain properties of integers, when generalized to rings, attach more naturally to the ideals than to the elements of the ring. For instance, the [[prime ideal]]s of a ring are analogous to [[prime number]]s, and the [[Chinese remainder theorem]] can be generalized to ideals.  There is a version of [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic|unique prime factorization]] for the ideals of a [[Dedekind domain]] (a type of ring important in [[number theory]]).

The concept of an [[order ideal]] in [[order theory]] is derived from the notion of ideal in ring theory. A [[fractional ideal]] is a generalization of an ideal, and the usual ideals are sometimes called '''integral ideals''' for clarity.

== History ==
Ideals were first proposed by [[Richard Dedekind]] in 1876 in the third edition of his book ''[[Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie]]'' (English: ''Lectures on Number Theory''). They were a generalization of the concept of [[ideal number]]s developed by [[Ernst Kummer]].&lt;ref name="flt"&gt;{{cite book

| title = An introduction to number theory
| year = 2005

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later the concept was expanded by [[David Hilbert]] and especially [[Emmy Noether]].

== Definitions ==
For an arbitrary ring &lt;math&gt;(R,+,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;(R,+)&lt;/math&gt; be its [[additive group]]. A subset &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''two-sided ideal''' (or simply an '''ideal''') of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; if it is an additive subgroup of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; that "absorbs multiplication by elements of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;." Formally we mean that &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is an ideal if it satisfies the following conditions:

# &lt;math&gt;(I,+)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[subgroup]] of &lt;math&gt;(R,+)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in I, \forall r \in R :\quad x \cdot r, r \cdot x \in I &lt;/math&gt;
Equivalently, an ideal of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a sub-&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-[[bimodule]] of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

A subset &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''right ideal''' of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;See Hazewinkel et al. (2004), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; if it is an additive subgroup of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and absorbs multiplication on the right, that is:
# &lt;math&gt;(I,+)&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;(R,+)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in I, \forall r \in R: \quad x \cdot r \in I.&lt;/math&gt;
Equivalently, a right ideal of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a right &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-[[module (mathematics)|submodule]] of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly a subset &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''left ideal''' of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; if it is an additive subgroup of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; absorbing multiplication on the left:
# &lt;math&gt;(I,+)&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;(R, +)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in I, \forall r \in R: \quad r \cdot x \in I.&lt;/math&gt;
Equivalently, a left ideal of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a left &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-submodule of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

In all cases, the first condition can be replaced by the following well-known criterion that ensures a nonempty subset of a group is a subgroup:

:1'. &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is [[empty set|non-empty]] and &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y \in I: x - y \in I&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;In fact, since &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be [[unital ring|unital]], it suffices that &lt;math&gt;x + y&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, since the second condition implies that &lt;math&gt;-y&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The left ideals in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; are exactly the right ideals in the [[opposite ring]] &lt;math&gt;R^o&lt;/math&gt; and vice versa.

A two-sided ideal is a left ideal that is also a right ideal, and is often called an ideal except to emphasize that there might exist single-sided ideals. When &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a commutative ring, the definitions of left, right, and two-sided ideal coincide, and the term ''ideal'' is used alone.

== Properties ==

{0} and ''R'' are ideals in every ring ''R''. If ''R'' is a [[division ring]] or a [[Field (mathematics)|field]], then these are its only ideals. The ideal ''R'' is called the '''unit ideal'''.  Any ideal ''I'' is a '''proper ideal''' if it is a proper subset of ''R'', that is, if ''I'' does not equal ''R''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lang|2005|loc=Section III.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as [[normal subgroup]]s of groups are [[Kernel (algebra)|kernels]] of group [[homomorphisms]], ideals have interpretations as kernels. For a nonempty subset ''A'' of ''R'': 
* ''A'' is an ideal of ''R'' if and only if it is a kernel of a ring homomorphism from ''R''.
* ''A'' is a right ideal of ''R'' if and only if it is a kernel of a homomorphism from the right ''R'' module ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; to another right ''R'' module.
* ''A'' is a left ideal of ''R'' if and only if it is a kernel of a homomorphism from the left ''R'' module &lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' to another left ''R'' module.

If ''p'' is in ''R'', then ''pR'' is a right ideal and ''Rp'' is a left ideal of ''R''. These are called, respectively, the [[Principal ideal|principal]] right and left ideals generated by ''p''. To remember which is which, note that right ideals are [[invariant (mathematics)#Invariant set|stable under]] right-multiplication (''IR''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''I'') and left ideals are stable under left-multiplication (''RI''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''I'').

The connection between [[coset]]s and ideals can be seen by switching the operation from "multiplication" to "addition".

== Motivation ==
Ideals &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; are in some sense a generalisation of the set of multiples of an integer. That is, &lt;math&gt;n\mathbb{Z}\subset\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;

Intuitively, the definition can be motivated as follows: Suppose we have a subset &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and that we would like to obtain a ring with the same structure as &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, except that the elements of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; should be zero (they are in some sense "negligible").

But if &lt;math&gt;s_1=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_2=0&lt;/math&gt; in our new ring, then surely &lt;math&gt;s_1+s_2&lt;/math&gt; should be zero too, and &lt;math&gt;r s_1&lt;/math&gt; as well as &lt;math&gt;s_1 r&lt;/math&gt; should be zero for ''any'' element &lt;math&gt;r \in R&lt;/math&gt; (zero or not).

The definition of an ideal is such that the ideal &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; generated (see below) by &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is exactly the set of elements that are forced to become zero if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; becomes zero, and the [[quotient ring]] &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt; is the desired ring where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is zero, and ''only'' elements that are forced by &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to be zero are zero. The requirement that &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt; should have the same structure (except that &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; becomes zero) is formalized by the condition that the projection from &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt; is a (surjective) [[ring homomorphism]].

The quintessential example is when &lt;math&gt;R=\mathbb{Z},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S=\{n\}&lt;/math&gt; for some nonzero &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. By "considering &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; to be zero", we are essentially reducing elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; to their remainder after dividing by n. Thus &lt;math&gt;I=n\mathbb{Z}=\{...,-2n,-n,0,n,2n,...\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R/I=\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}=\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; is the set of possible remainders after dividing an integer by n (ie. the [[cyclic group]] of order n).

== Examples ==
* In a ring ''R'', the set ''R'' itself forms an ideal of ''R''. Also, the subset containing only the additive identity 0&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; forms an ideal. These two ideals are usually referred to as the ''trivial ideals'' of ''R''.
* The even [[integer]]s form an ideal in the ring &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; of all integers; it is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;2\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. This is because the sum of any even integers is even, and the product of any integer with an even integer is also even. Similarly, the set of all integers divisible by a fixed integer ''n'' is an ideal denoted &lt;math&gt;n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The set of all [[polynomial]]s with real coefficients which are divisible by the polynomial ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 is an ideal in the ring of all polynomials.
* The set of all ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] whose last row is zero forms a right ideal in the ring of all ''n''-by-''n'' matrices. It is not a left ideal. The set of all ''n''-by-''n'' matrices whose last ''column'' is zero forms a left ideal but not a right ideal.
* The ring &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; of all [[continuous function]]s ''f'' from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; under [[pointwise multiplication]] contains the ideal of all continuous functions ''f'' such that ''f''(1) = 0. Another ideal in &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; is given by those functions which vanish for large enough arguments, i.e. those continuous functions ''f'' for which there exists a number ''L'' &gt; 0 such that ''f''(''x'') = 0 whenever |''x''| &gt; ''L''.
* [[Compact operator]]s form an ideal in the ring of [[bounded operators]].

== Ideal generated by a set ==
Let ''R'' be a (possibly not unital) ring. Any intersection of any nonempty family of left ideals of ''R'' is again a left ideal of ''R''. If ''X'' is any subset of ''R'', then the intersection of all left ideals of ''R'' containing ''X'' is a left ideal ''I'' of ''R'' containing ''X'', and is clearly the smallest left ideal to do so. This ideal ''I'' is said to be the left ideal '''[[generating set of a module|generated]]''' by ''X''. Similar definitions can be created by using right ideals or two-sided ideals in place of left ideals.

If ''R'' has unity, then the left, right, or two-sided ideal of ''R'' generated by a subset ''X'' of ''R'' can be expressed internally as we will now describe. The following set is a left ideal:
:&lt;math&gt;\{r_1x_1+\dots+r_nx_n \mid n\in\mathbb{N}, r_i\in R, x_i\in X\}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Each element described would have to be in every left ideal containing ''X'', so this left ideal is in fact the left ideal generated by ''X''. The right ideal and ideal generated by ''X'' can also be expressed in the same way:
:&lt;math&gt;\{x_1r_1+\dots+x_nr_n \mid n\in\mathbb{N}, r_i\in R, x_i\in X\}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\{r_1x_1s_1+\dots+r_nx_ns_n \mid n\in\mathbb{N}, r_i\in R,s_i\in R, x_i\in X\}.\,&lt;/math&gt;
The former is the right ideal generated by ''X'', and the latter is the ideal generated by ''X''.

By convention, 0 is viewed as the [[empty sum|sum of zero such terms]], agreeing with the fact that the ideal of ''R'' generated by ∅ is {0} by the previous definition.

If a left ideal ''I'' of ''R'' has a finite subset ''F'' such that ''I'' is the left ideal  generated by ''F'', then the left ideal ''I'' is said to be [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]]. Similar terms are also applied to right ideals and two-sided ideals generated by finite subsets.

In the special case where the set ''X'' is just a singleton {''a''} for some ''a'' in ''R'', then the above definitions turn into the following:

:&lt;math&gt;Ra=\{ra \mid r\in R\}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;aR=\{ar \mid  r\in R\}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;RaR=\{r_1as_1+\dots+r_nas_n \mid n\in\mathbb{N}, r_i\in R,s_i\in R\}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

These ideals are known as the left/right/two-sided [[principal ideal]]s generated by ''a''. It is also very common to denote the two-sided ideal generated by ''a'' as (''a'').

If ''R'' does not have a unit, then the internal descriptions above must be modified slightly. In addition to the finite sums of products of things in ''X'' with things in ''R'', we must allow the addition of ''n''-fold sums of the form ''x''+''x''+...+''x'', and ''n''-fold sums of the form (''−x'')+(''−x'')+...+(''−x'') for every ''x'' in ''X'' and every ''n'' in the natural numbers. When ''R'' has a unit, this extra requirement becomes superfluous.

=== Example ===
* In the ring &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; of integers, every ideal can be generated by a single number (so &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[principal ideal domain]]), and the only two generators of ''pR'' are ''p'' and ''−p''. The concepts of "ideal" and "number" are therefore almost identical in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. If ''aR''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''bR'' in an arbitrary domain, then ''au''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b'' for some [[invertible element|unit]] ''u''. Conversely, for any unit ''u'', ''aR''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''auu''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''auR''. So, in a commutative principal ideal domain, the generators of the ideal ''aR'' are just the elements ''au'' where ''u'' is an arbitrary unit. This explains the case of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; since 1 and −1 are the only units of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Types of ideals ==
* '''[[Factor Ideal]]''': Suppose that '''R''' is a ring and that '''I''' is a (two-sided) ideal of '''R'''. Then we can use '''R''' and '''I''' to create a new ring, called "the factor ring of '''R''' modulo '''I'''". This ring is denoted '''R'''/'''I''', and its elements are certain subsets of '''R''' associated to '''I'''. The most well known examples are the rings '''Z'''/n'''Z''', created from the ring '''Z''' of integers and its ideals.

''To simplify the description all rings are assumed to be commutative. The non-commutative case is discussed in detail in the respective articles.''

Ideals are important because they appear as kernels of ring homomorphisms and allow one to define [[factor ring]]s. Different types of ideals are studied because they can be used to construct different types of factor rings.

* '''[[Maximal ideal]]''': A proper ideal ''I'' is called a '''maximal ideal''' if there exists no other proper ideal ''J'' with ''I'' a proper subset of ''J''.  The factor ring of a maximal ideal is a [[simple ring]] in general and is a [[field (mathematics)|field]] for commutative rings.&lt;ref&gt;Because simple commutative rings are fields. See {{cite book|author=Lam|year=2001|title=A First Course in Noncommutative Rings|url={{Google books|plainurl=y|id=f15FyZuZ3-4C|page=39|text=simple commutative rings}}|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Minimal ideal]]''': A nonzero ideal is called minimal if it contains no other nonzero ideal.
* '''[[Prime ideal]]''': A proper ideal ''I'' is called a '''prime ideal''' if for any ''a'' and ''b'' in ''R'', if ''ab'' is in ''I'', then at least one of ''a'' and ''b'' is in ''I''. The factor ring of a prime ideal is a [[prime ring]] in general and is an [[integral domain]] for commutative rings.
* '''[[Radical of an ideal|Radical ideal]]''' or [[semiprime ideal]]: A proper ideal ''I'' is called '''radical''' or '''semiprime''' if for any ''a'' in ''R'', if ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is in ''I'' for some ''n'', then ''a'' is in ''I''. The factor ring of a radical ideal is a [[semiprime ring]] for general rings, and is a [[reduced ring]] for commutative rings.
* '''[[Primary ideal]]''': An ideal ''I'' is called a '''primary ideal''' if for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''R'', if ''ab'' is in ''I'', then at least one of ''a'' and ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is in ''I'' for some [[natural number]] ''n''. Every prime ideal is primary, but not conversely. A semiprime primary ideal is prime.
* '''[[Principal ideal]]''': An ideal generated by ''one'' element.
* '''Finitely generated ideal''': This type of ideal is [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] as a module.
* '''[[Primitive ideal]]''': A left primitive ideal is the [[Annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] of a [[simple module|simple]] left [[module (mathematics)|module]].  A right primitive ideal is defined similarly.  Actually (despite the name) the left and right primitive ideals are always two-sided ideals. Primitive ideals are prime. A factor rings constructed with a right (left) primitive ideals is a right (left) [[primitive ring]]. For commutative rings the primitive ideals are maximal, and so commutative primitive rings are all fields.
* '''[[Irreducible ideal]]''': An ideal is said to be irreducible if it cannot be written as an intersection of ideals which properly contain it.
* '''Comaximal ideals''': Two ideals &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{i}, \mathfrak{j}&lt;/math&gt; are said to be '''comaximal''' if &lt;math&gt;x + y = 1&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathfrak{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathfrak{j}&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''[[Regular ideal]]''': This term has multiple uses. See the article for a list.
* '''[[Nil ideal]]''':  An ideal is a nil ideal if each of its elements is nilpotent.

Two other important terms using "ideal" are not always ideals of their ring. See their respective articles for details:
*'''[[Fractional ideal]]''': This is usually defined when ''R'' is a commutative domain with [[quotient field]] ''K''. Despite their names, fractional ideals are ''R'' submodules of ''K'' with a special property. If the fractional ideal is contained entirely in ''R'', then it is truly an ideal of ''R''.
*'''[[Invertible ideal]]''': Usually an invertible ideal ''A'' is defined as a fractional ideal for which there is another fractional ideal ''B'' such that ''AB''=''BA''=''R''. Some authors may also apply "invertible ideal" to ordinary ring ideals ''A'' and ''B'' with ''AB''=''BA''=''R'' in rings other than domains.

== Further properties ==
* In rings with identity, an ideal is proper ''if and only if'' it does not contain 1 or equivalently it does not contain a unit.
* The set of ideals of any ring are [[partially ordered set|partially ordered]] via [[subset|subset inclusion]], in fact they are additionally a [[complete lattice|complete]] [[modular lattice]] in this order with [[join (lattice theory)|join operation]] given by addition of ideals and [[meet (lattice theory)|meet operation]] given by set intersection. The trivial ideals supply the least and greatest elements: the largest ideal is the entire ring, and the smallest ideal is the zero ideal. The lattice is not, in general, a [[distributive lattice]].
* Unfortunately [[Zorn's lemma]] does not necessarily apply to the collection of proper ideals of ''R''. However, when ''R'' has identity 1, this collection can be reexpressed as "the collection of ideals which do not contain 1". It can be checked that Zorn's lemma now applies to this collection, and consequently there are maximal proper ideals of ''R''. With a little more work, it can be shown that every proper ideal is contained in a maximal ideal. See ''[[Krull's theorem]]'' at [[maximal ideal]].
* The ring ''R'' can be considered as a left module over itself, and the left ideals of ''R'' are then seen as the [[submodule]]s of this module. Similarly, the right ideals are submodules of ''R'' as a right module over itself, and the two-sided ideals are submodules of ''R'' as a [[bimodule]] over itself. If ''R'' is commutative, then all three sorts of module are the same, just as all three sorts of ideal are the same.
* Every ideal is a [[pseudo-ring]].
* The ideals of a ring form a [[semiring]] (with identity element ''R'') under addition and multiplication of ideals.

== Ideal operations ==
The sum and product of ideals are defined as follows. For  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{b}&lt;/math&gt;, ideals of a ring R,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}+\mathfrak{b}:=\{a+b \mid a \in \mathfrak{a} \mbox{ and } b \in \mathfrak{b}\}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a} \mathfrak{b}:=\{a_1b_1+ \dots + a_nb_n \mid a_i \in \mathfrak{a} \mbox{ and } b_i \in \mathfrak{b}, i=1, 2, \dots, n; \mbox{ for } n=1, 2, \dots\},&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. the product of two ideals &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{b}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the ideal &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}\mathfrak{b}&lt;/math&gt; generated by all products of the form ''ab'' with ''a'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; and ''b'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{b}&lt;/math&gt;. The product &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}\mathfrak{b}&lt;/math&gt; is [[subset|contained in]] the intersection of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{b}&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{b}&lt;/math&gt; is also the intersection of all ideals containing both &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{b}&lt;/math&gt;.

The sum and the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of ideals is again an ideal; with these two operations as join and meet, the set of all ideals of a given ring forms a [[complete lattice|complete]] [[modular lattice]].  Also, the [[union (set theory)|union]] of two ideals is a subset of the sum of those two ideals, because for any element ''a'' inside an ideal, we can write it as ''a''+0, or 0+''a''; therefore, it is contained in the sum as well. However, the union of two ideals is not necessarily an ideal; rather, the sum is the ideal generated by the union.

The three operations of intersection, sum (or join), and product make the set of ideals of a commutative ring into a [[quantale]].

== Examples of ideal operations ==
In &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; we have
:&lt;math&gt;(n)\cap(m) = \text{lcm}(n,m)\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
since &lt;math&gt;(n)\cap(m)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of integers which are divisible by both &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;R = \mathbb{C}[x,y,z,w]&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;I = (z, w),\text{ }J = (x+z,y+w),\text{ }K = (x+z, w)&lt;/math&gt;. Then,
* &lt;math&gt;I + J = (z,w, x+z, y+w) = (x, y, z, w)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I + K = (z, w, x + z)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;IJ = (z(x + z), z(y + w), w(x + z), w(y + w))= (z^2 + xz, zy + wz, wx + wz, wy + w^2)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;IK = (xz + z^2, zw, xw + zw, w^2)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;I \cap J = IJ&lt;/math&gt; while &lt;math&gt;I \cap K = (w, xz + z^2) \neq IK&lt;/math&gt;
In the first computation, we see the general pattern for taking the sum of two finitely generated ideals, it is the ideal generated by the union of their generators. In the last three we observe that products and intersections agree whenever the two ideals intersect in the zero ideal. These computations can be checked using [[Macaulay 2|Macaulay2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/doc/Macaulay2-1.9.2/share/doc/Macaulay2/Macaulay2Doc/html/_ideals.html|title=ideals|website=www.math.uiuc.edu|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/doc/Macaulay2-1.9.2/share/doc/Macaulay2/Macaulay2Doc/html/_sums_cm_spproducts_cm_spand_sppowers_spof_spideals.html|title=sums, products, and powers of ideals|website=www.math.uiuc.edu|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/doc/Macaulay2-1.9.2/share/doc/Macaulay2/Macaulay2Doc/html/_intersection_spof_spideals.html|title=intersection of ideals|website=www.math.uiuc.edu|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideals and congruence relations ==
There is a bijective correspondence between ideals and [[congruence relation]]s (equivalence relations that respect the ring structure) on the ring:

Given an ideal ''I'' of a ring ''R'', let ''x'' ~ ''y'' if ''x'' − ''y'' ∈ ''I''.  Then ~ is a congruence relation on ''R''.

Conversely, given a congruence relation ~ on ''R'', let ''I'' = {''x'' : ''x'' ~ 0}.  Then ''I'' is an ideal of ''R''.

An '''ideology''' is a collection of [[normative]] [[beliefs]] and [[values]] that an individual or group holds for other than purely [[epistemic]] reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Honderich |first1=Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |date=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-866132-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined by [[Antoine Destutt de Tracy]] in 1796, who conceived it as the "science of ideas". In contemporary philosophy it is narrower in scope than that original concept, or the ideas expressed in broad concepts such as ''[[worldview]]'', ''[[imaginary (sociology)|imaginary]]'' and ''[[ontology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2013 |last1=Steger |first1=Manfred B. |last2=James |first2=Paul |authorlink2=Paul James (academic) |title=Levels of Subjective Globalization: Ideologies, Imaginaries, Ontologies |url=https://www.academia.edu/4311113 |journal=Perspectives on Global Development and Technology |volume=12 |issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the political world, for instance, there are many well-known [[List of political ideologies|political ideologies]], which cover a wide range of human interests.

In the sense defined by French Marxist philosopher [[Louis Althusser]], ideology is "the imagined existence (or idea) of things as it relates to the real conditions of existence".

==Etymology and history==
[[File:Destutt de Tracy.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Destutt de Tracy]] (1754-1836)]]
The term "ideology" was born during the [[Reign of Terror]] of [[French Revolution]], and acquired several other meanings thereafter.

The word, and the system of ideas associated with it, was coined by [[Antoine Destutt de Tracy]] in 1796,&lt;ref name = hart&gt;{{cite web|last = Hart|first = David M. |date = 1 January 2002|url = http://www.econlib.org/library/Tracy/DestuttdeTracyBio.html |title = Life and Works of Antoine Louis Claude, Comte Destutt de Tracy|website = Library of Economics and Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he was in prison pending trial during the Terror. The word was created by assembling the words [[idea#John Locke|''idea'']], from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἰδέα|ἰδέα]]}} (near to the [[John Locke|Lockean]] sense) and ''[[-logy]]'', from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]]}}.

The coup that overthrew [[Maximilien Robespierre]] allowed Tracy to pursue his work.&lt;ref name = kennedy&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kennedy |first=Emmet |date=Jul–Sep 1979 |title="Ideology" from Destutt De Tracy to Marx |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=353–368 |jstor=2709242 |doi=10.2307/2709242|bibcode=1961JHI....22..215C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = hart/&gt;

Tracy reacted to the terroristic phase of the revolution by trying to work out a rational system of ideas to oppose the irrational mob impulses that had nearly destroyed him.  He devised the term for a "science of ideas" he hoped would form a secure foundation for the moral and political sciences. He based the word on two things:  1) sensations people experience as they interact with the material world; and 2) the ideas that form in their minds due to those sensations. He conceived "Ideology" as a [[liberalism|liberal]] philosophy that would defend individual liberty, property,  [[free markets]], and constitutional limits on state power.  He argues that among these aspects ideology is the most generic term, because the science of ideas also contains the study of their expression and deduction.&lt;ref name = kennedy/&gt;

Tracy worked this out during the Napoleonic regime, and [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] came to view 'Ideology' a term of abuse, which he often hurled against his liberal foes in Tracy's [[Institut National]]. According to [[Karl Mannheim]]'s historical reconstruction of the shifts in the meaning of ideology, the modern meaning of the word was born when Napoleon used it to describe his opponents as "the ideologues". [[Karl Marx]] adopted this negative sense of the term and used it in his writings (he described Tracy as a "fischblütige Bourgeoisdoktrinär", a fishblooded bourgeois doctrinaire).&lt;ref&gt;De Tracy, Destutt (1801) ''Les Éléments d'idéologie'', 3rd ed. (1817), p. 4, cited by: Mannheim, Karl (1929) Ideologie und Utopie, 2nd footnote in the chapter ''The problem of "false consciousness"''&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracy's major book, ''[[The Elements of Ideology]]'', was soon translated into the major languages of Europe, and in the next generation, when post-Napoleonic governments adopted a reactionary stance, influenced the Italian, Spanish and Russian thinkers who had begun to describe themselves as "liberals" and who attempted to reignite revolutionary activity in the early 1820s (these included the Carlist rebels in Spain, the Carbonari societies in France and Italy, and the Decembrists in Russia).

In the century after Tracy, the term ideology moved back and forth between positive and negative connotations.

(Perhaps the most accessible source for the near-original meaning of ''ideology'' is [[Hippolyte Taine]]'s work on the [[Ancien Régime]] (the first volume of "Origins of Contemporary France"). He describes ideology as rather like teaching philosophy by the [[Socratic method]], but without extending the vocabulary beyond what the general reader already possessed, and without the examples from observation that practical science would require. Taine identifies it not just with Destutt De Tracy, but also with his milieu, and includes [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]] as one of its precursors. (Destutt de Tracy read the works of Locke and Condillac while he was imprisoned during the [[Reign of Terror]].))

The term "ideology" has [[Euphemism#Euphemism treadmill|dropped some of its pejorative sting]], and has become a neutral term in the analysis of differing political opinions and views of social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, Terry (1991) ''Ideology. An introduction'', Verso, pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Karl Marx]] situated the term within [[class struggle]] and domination,&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Robert C (1978). ''The Marx-Engels Reader'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company, pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''MER'', pg. 154&lt;/ref&gt; others believed it was a necessary part of [[structural functionalism|institutional functioning]] and [[social cohesion|social integration]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan Silbey, [http://www.credoreference.com/entry/cupsoc/ideology "Ideology"] at ''Cambridge Dictionary of Sociology''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
There has been considerable analysis of different ideological patterns. Some have described this kind of analysis as ''meta-ideology''—the study of the structure, form, and manifestation of ideologies. Recent analysis tends to posit that ideology is a ''coherent system of ideas'' that rely on a few basic assumptions about reality that may or may not have any factual basis. Ideas become ideologies (that is, become coherent, repeated patterns) through the subjective ongoing choices that people make, serving as the seed around which further thought grows. According to most recent analysis, ideologies are neither necessarily right nor wrong. Believers in ideology range from passive acceptance through fervent advocacy to true belief.

This accords with definitions, such as by [[Manfred Steger]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]], that emphasize both the issue of patterning and contingent claims to truth:

{{quote|Ideologies are patterned clusters of normatively imbued ideas and concepts, including particular representations of power relations. These conceptual maps help people navigate the complexity of their political universe and carry claims to social truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2010 |last1=James |first1=Paul |authorlink=Paul James (academic) |last2=Steger |first2=Manfred |title=Globalization and Culture, Vol. 4: Ideologies of Globalism |url=https://www.academia.edu/4510893 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The works of George Walford and Harold Walsby, done under the heading of [[systematic ideology]], are attempts to explore the relationships between ideology and social systems. [[Charles Blattberg]] offers an account that distinguishes political ideologies from political philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;Blattberg, Charles, "Political Philosophies and Political Ideologies", in ''Patriotic Elaborations: Essays in Practical Philosophy'', Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2009.[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1755117]&lt;/ref&gt;

David W. Minar describes six different ways the word "ideology" has been used:
# As a collection of certain ideas with certain kinds of ''content'', usually normative
# As the ''form or internal logical structure'' that ideas have within a set
# By the role ideas play in ''human-social interaction''
# By the role ideas play in the ''structure of an organization''
# As meaning, whose purpose is ''persuasion''
# As the ''locus'' of social interaction

For Willard A. Mullins an ideology should be contrasted with the related (but different) issues of ''utopia'' and ''historical myth''. An ideology is composed of four basic characteristics:
# it must have power over cognition
# it must be capable of guiding one's evaluations;
# it must provide guidance towards action; and
# it must be logically coherent.

[[Terry Eagleton]] outlines (more or less in no particular order) some definitions of ideology:&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, Terry (1991) ''Ideology: An Introduction'', Verso, {{ISBN|0-86091-319-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The process of production of meanings, signs and values in social life
# A body of ideas characteristic of a particular social group or class
# Ideas that help legitimate a dominant political power
# False ideas that help legitimate a dominant political power
# Systematically distorted communication
# Ideas that offer a position for a subject
# Forms of thought motivated by social interests
# Identity thinking
# Socially necessary illusion
# The conjuncture of discourse and power
# The medium in which conscious social actors make sense of their world
# Action-oriented sets of beliefs
# The confusion of linguistic and phenomenal reality
# Semiotic closure
# The indispensable medium in which individuals live out their relations to a social structure
# The process that converts social life to a natural reality

The German philosopher [https://web.archive.org/web/20110701015904/http://www.ideologieforschung.de/web/Christian_Duncker.html Christian Duncker] called for a "critical reflection of the ideology concept" (2006). In his work, he strove to bring the concept of ideology into the foreground, as well as the closely connected concerns of [[epistemology]] and history. In this work, the term ideology is defined in terms of a system of presentations that explicitly or implicitly claim to absolute truth.

There are many different kinds of ideologies: [[politics|political]], [[Social issues|social]], [[epistemological]], and [[ethics|ethical]].

===Marxist view===
[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Karl Marx]] posits that a society's dominant ideology is integral to its superstructure.]]
In the [[Marxist]] [[base and superstructure (Marxism)|economic base and superstructure]] model of society, ''base'' denotes the [[relations of production]] and [[modes of production]], and ''superstructure'' denotes the dominant ideology (religious, legal, political systems). The economic base of production determines the political superstructure of a society. Ruling class-interests determine the superstructure and the nature of the justifying ideology—actions feasible because the ruling class control the means of production. For example, in a [[feudal]] [[mode of production]], religious ideology is the most prominent aspect of the superstructure, while in capitalist formations, ideologies such as [[liberalism]] and [[social democracy]] dominate. Hence the great importance of the ideology justifying a society; it politically confuses the alienated groups of society via [[false consciousness]].

Some explanations have been presented. [[György Lukács]] proposes ideology as a [[psychological projection|projection]] of the [[class consciousness]] of the ruling class. [[Antonio Gramsci]] uses [[cultural hegemony]] to explain why the [[working-class]] have a false ideological conception of what are their best interests. Marx argued that "The class which has the means of material production at its disposal has control at the same time over the means of mental production."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marx|first=Karl|title="The Civil War in France", The Marx-Engels Reader 2nd ed.|year=1978a|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marxist formulation of "ideology as an instrument of social reproduction" is conceptually important to the [[sociology of knowledge]],&lt;ref&gt;In this discipline, there are lexical disputes over the meaning of the word "ideology" ("false consciousness" as advocated by Marx, or rather "false position" of a statement in itself is correct but irrelevant in the context in which it is produced, as in [[Max Weber]]'s opinion): {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Eleggibilità più ampia senza i paletti del peculato d'uso? Un'occasione (perduta) per affrontare il tema delle leggi ad personam |journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia Edizione Online |date=2005| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89394794}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; viz. [[Karl Mannheim]], [[Daniel Bell]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]] et al. Moreover, Mannheim has developed, and progressed, from the "total" but "special" Marxist conception of ideology to a "general" and "total" ideological conception acknowledging that all ideology (including [[Marxism]]) resulted from social life, an idea developed by the [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. [[Slavoj Žižek]] and the earlier [[Frankfurt School]] added to the "general theory" of ideology a psychoanalytic insight that ideologies do not include only conscious, but also [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] ideas.

===Louis Althusser's ideological state apparatuses===
[[Louis Althusser]] proposed both spiritual and materialistic conception of ideology, which made use of a special type of discourse: the [[lacunar discourse]]. A number of propositions, which are never untrue, suggest a number of other propositions, which are. In this way, the essence of the lacunar discourse is what is ''not'' told (but is suggested).

For example, the statement "All are equal before the law," which is a theoretical groundwork of current legal systems, suggests that all people may be of equal worth or have equal "opportunities". This is not true, for the concept of [[private property]] and power over the [[means of production]] results in some people being able to own more (''much'' more) than others. This power disparity contradicts the claim that all share both practical worth and future opportunity equally; for example, the rich can afford better legal representation, which practically privileges them before the law.

Althusser also proffered the concept of the [[ideological state apparatus]] to explain his theory of ideology. His first thesis was "''ideology has no history''": while individual ideolog''ies'' have histories, interleaved with the general class struggle of society, the general form of ideology is external to history.

For Althusser, beliefs and ideas are the products of social practices, not the reverse. His thesis that "''ideas are material''" is illustrated by the "scandalous advice" of [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] toward unbelievers: "Kneel and pray, and then you will believe." What is ultimately ideological for Althusser are not the subjective beliefs held in the conscious "minds" of human individuals, but rather discourses that produce these beliefs, the material institutions and rituals that individuals take part in without submitting it to conscious examination and so much more [[critical thinking]].

===Ideology and the Commodity in the works of Guy Debord===
The French [[Marxist]] theorist [[Guy Debord]], founding member of the [[Situationist International]], argued that when the commodity becomes the "essential category" of society, i.e. when the process of [[commodification]] has been consummated to its fullest extent, the image of society propagated by the commodity (as it describes all of life as constituted by notions and objects deriving their value only as commodities tradeable in terms of [[exchange value]]), colonizes all of life and reduces society to a mere representation, [[The Society of the Spectacle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Society of the Spectacle|publisher=Zone Books|author=Guy Debord|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silvio Vietta: ideology and rationality===
{{Disputed section|date=July 2015}}
The German [[cultural historian]] [[Silvio Vietta]] described the development and expansion of Western rationality from ancient times onwards as often accompanied by and shaped by ideologies like that of the "just war", the "true religion", racism, nationalism, or the vision of future history as a kind of heaven on earth in communism. He said that ideas like these became ideologies by giving hegemonic political actions an idealistic veneer and equipping their leaders with a higher and, in the "[[political religion]]s" ([[Eric Voegelin]]), nearly God-like power, so that they became masters over the lives (and the deaths) of millions of people. He considered that ideologies therefore contributed to power politics irrational shields of ideas beneath which they could operate as manifestations of idealism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Theory of Global Civilization: Rationality and the Irrational as the Driving Forces of History|publisher=Kindle Ebooks|author=Silvio Vietta|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rationalität. Eine Weltgeschichte. Europäische Kulturgeschichte und Globalisierung|publisher=Fink|author=Silvio Vietta|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eric Hoffer:  unifying agents===
The American philosopher [[Eric Hoffer]] identified several elements that unify followers of a particular ideology:&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 91 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt;
 
1) Hatred:  "Mass movements can rise and spread without a God, but never without belief in a devil.".&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "ideal devil" is a foreigner.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

2) Imitation:  "The less satisfaction we derive from being ourselves, the greater is our desire to be like others ... the more we mistrust our judgment and luck, the more are we ready to follow the example of others."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 101-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

3) Persuasion:  The proselytizing zeal of propagandists derives from "a passionate search for something not yet found more than a desire to bestow something we already have."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

4) Coercion:  Hoffer asserts that violence and fanaticism are interdependent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  People forcibly converted to Islamic or communist beliefs become as fanatical as those who did the forcing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 107–8.&lt;/ref&gt;  "It takes fanatical faith to rationalize our cowardice."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

5) Leadership:  Without the leader, there is no movement.  Often the leader must wait long in the wings until the time is ripe.  He calls for sacrifices in the present, to justify his vision of a breathtaking future.  The skills required include:  audacity, brazenness, iron will, fanatical conviction; passionate hatred, cunning, a delight in symbols; ability to inspire blind faith in the masses and a group of able lieutenants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 112-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Charlatanism is indispensable, and the leader often imitates both friend and foe, "a single-minded fashioning after a model."  He will not lead followers towards the "promised land," but only "away from their unwanted selves."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 116-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

6) Action:  Original thoughts are suppressed, and unity encouraged, if the masses are kept occupied through great projects, marches, exploration and industry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 120-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

7) Suspicion:  "There is prying and spying, tense watching and a tense awareness of being watched."  This pathological mistrust goes unchallenged and encourages conformity, not dissent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ronald Inglehart===

[[Ronald Inglehart]] of the University of Michigan is author of the [[World Values Survey]], which, since 1980, has mapped social attitudes in 100 countries representing 90% of global population. Results indicate that where people live is likely to closely correlate with their ideological beliefs. In much of Africa, South Asia and the Middle East, people prefer traditional beliefs and are less tolerant of liberal values. Protestant Europe, at the other extreme, adheres more to secular beliefs and liberal values. Alone among high-income countries, the United States is exceptional in its adherence to traditional beliefs, in this case Christianity.

==Political ideologies==&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Charles de Gaulle]]--&gt;
{{See also|List of political ideologies}}
In [[social studies]], a political ideology is a certain ethical set of [[ideal (ethics)|ideals]], principles, [[doctrine]]s, [[mythology|myths]], or [[symbol]]s of a [[social movement]], [[institution]], [[social class|class]], or large group that explains how society should work, and offers some political and cultural blueprint for a certain social order. Political ideologies are concerned with many different aspects of a society, including (for example): the economy, [[education]], [[health care]], [[labor law]], [[criminal law]], the [[justice system]], the provision of [[social security]] and [[social welfare]], [[trade]], the [[environmentalism|environment]], [[minor (law)|minors]], [[immigration]], [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], use of the [[military]], [[patriotism]], and [[established religion]].

Political ideologies have two dimensions:
# Goals: how society should work
# Methods: the most appropriate ways to achieve the ideal arrangement

There are many proposed methods for the classification of political ideologies, each of these different methods generate a specific [[political spectrum]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Ideologies also identify themselves by their position on the [[political spectrum]] (such as the [[left-wing politics|left]], the [[center (politics)|center]] or the [[right-wing politics|right]]), though precision in this respect can very often become controversial. Finally, ideologies can be distinguished from [[political strategy|political strategies]] (e.g., [[populism]]) and from single issues that a party may be built around (e.g. [[Marijuana political parties|legalization of marijuana]]). Philosopher Michael Oakeshott provides a good definition of ideology as "the formalized abridgment of the supposed sub-stratum of the rational truth contained in the tradition".

A political ideology largely concerns itself with how to allocate [[power (sociology)|power]] and to what ends power should be used. Some parties follow a certain ideology very closely, while others may take broad inspiration from a group of related ideologies without specifically embracing any one of them. Each political ideology contains certain ideas on what it considers the best [[form of government]] (e.g., [[democracy]], [[demagogy]], [[theocracy]], [[caliphate]] etc.), and the best [[economic system]] (e.g. [[capitalism]], [[socialism]], etc.). Sometimes the same word is used to identify both an ideology and one of its main ideas. For instance, "socialism" may refer to an economic system, or it may refer to an ideology that supports that economic system.

Studies of the concept of ideology itself (rather than specific ideologies) have been carried out under the name of [[systematic ideology]].

Post 1991, many commentators claim that we are living in a post-ideological age,&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Bell|Bell, D.]] ''[[The End of Ideology|The End of Ideology: On the Exhaustion of Political Ideas in the Fifties]] (2000) (2nd ed.). Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, pg. 393''&lt;/ref&gt; in which redemptive, all-encompassing ideologies have failed, and this view is often associated{{by whom|date=August 2015}} with [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s writings on "the end of history".&lt;ref&gt;Fukuyama, F. (1992)''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''. USA: The Free Press, xi&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Nienhueser sees research (in the field of [[human resource management]]) as ongoingly "generating ideology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nienhueser |first1=Werner |year=2011 |title=Empirical Research on Human Resource Management as a Production of Ideology |url=http://www.management-revue.org/papers/mrev_4_11_Nienhueser.pdf |journal=Management Revue |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=367–393 |doi=10.1688/1861-9908_mrev_2011_04_Nienhueser |issn=0935-9915 |access-date=2015-08-27 |quote=[...] current empirical research in HRM is generating ideology.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slavoj Zizek]] has pointed out how the very notion of post-ideology can enable the deepest, blindest form of ideology. A sort of false consciousness or false cynicism, engaged in for the purpose of lending one's point of view the respect of being objective, pretending neutral cynicism, without truly being so. Rather than help avoiding ideology, this lapse only deepens the commitment to an existing one. Zizek calls this "a post-modernist trap".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zizek |first=Slavoj |date=2008 |title=The Sublime Object of Ideology |edition=2nd |publisher=[[London: Verso]]|pages =xxxi, 25–27 |isbn=9781844673001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Sloterdijk]] advanced the same idea already in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sloterdijk |first=Peter |date=1988 |title=Critique of Cynical Reason |publisher=[[US: University of Minnesota Press]] |isbn=9780816615865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several studies that show that affinity to a specific political ideology is heritable.&lt;ref&gt;Bouchard, T. J., and McGue, M. (2003). "Genetic and environmental influences on human psychological differences." ''Journal of Neurobiology'', 54 (1), 44–45.” https://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1169974.files/Bouchard%20McGue%202003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cloninger, et al.

===Government ideology===
When a political ideology becomes a dominantly pervasive component within a government, one can speak of an [[ideocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Politics_of_ideocracy.html?id=xC6FAAAAMAAJ |title=Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz, Alfred Wayne Penn. Politics of Ideocracy|isbn=9780791422977|last1=Piekalkiewicz|first1=Jaroslaw|last2=Penn|first2=Alfred Wayne|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different forms of government utilize ideology in various ways, not always restricted to politics and society. Certain ideas and schools of thought become favored, or rejected, over others, depending on their compatibility with or use for the reigning social order.

===Implementation===

"Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back", said [[John Maynard Keynes]].&lt;ref&gt;The General Theory, p383-4&lt;/ref&gt; How do ideologies become part of government policy?
In ''[[The Anatomy of Revolution]]'', [[Crane Brinton]] said that new ideology spreads when there is discontent with the old regime.&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; Extremists such as [[Lenin]] and [[Robespierre]] will overcome more moderate revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, CH 6&lt;/ref&gt;  This stage is soon followed by [[Thermidor]], a reining back of revolutionary enthusiasm under pragmatists like [[Stalin]] and [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] who bring "normalcy and equilibrium".&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, CH 8&lt;/ref&gt;
A very similar sequence  ("men of ideas&gt;fanatics&gt;practical men of action") occurs in [[Eric Hoffer]], [[The True Believer]],&lt;ref&gt;Hoffer, chapters 15, 16,17&lt;/ref&gt; and Brinton's sequence is reiterated by [[J. William Fulbright]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulbright, The Arrogance of Power, 1967, chapters 3-7&lt;/ref&gt;
The revolution thus becomes established as an [[Ideocracy]], but its rise is likely to be checked by a [[Political midlife crisis]].

==Epistemological ideologies==
Even when the challenging of existing beliefs is encouraged, as in scientific theories, the dominant [[paradigm]] or [[mindset]] can prevent certain challenges, theories, or experiments from being advanced.

A special case of science adopted as ideology is that of ecology, which studies the relationships among living things on Earth. [[Perceptual psychology|Perceptual psychologist]] [[James J. Gibson]] believed that human perception of ecological relationships was the basis of [[self-awareness]] and [[cognition]] itself. [[Linguistics|Linguist]] [[George Lakoff]] has proposed a [[cognitive science of mathematics]] wherein even the most fundamental ideas of arithmetic would be seen as consequences or products of human perception—which is itself necessarily evolved within an ecology.

[[Deep ecology]] and the modern [[ecology movement]] (and, to a lesser degree, [[Green parties]]) appear to have adopted ecological sciences as a positive ideology.

Some accuse [[ecological economics]] of likewise turning scientific theory into [[political economy]], although theses in that science can often be tested. The modern practice of [[green economics]] fuses both approaches and seems to be part science, part ideology.

This is far from the only theory of economics raised to ideology status. Some notable economically based ideologies include [[neoliberalism]], [[monetarism]], [[mercantilism]], [[mixed economy]], [[social Darwinism]], [[communism]], [[laissez-faire|laissez-faire economics]], and [[free trade]]. There are also current theories of [[safe trade]] and [[fair trade]] that can be seen as ideologies.

==Psychological research==
Psychological research&lt;ref name="jost2008"/&gt; increasingly suggests that ideologies reflect (unconscious) motivational processes, as opposed to the view that political convictions always reflect independent and unbiased thinking. Jost, Ledgerwood and Hardin proposed in 2008 that ideologies may function as prepackaged units of interpretation that spread because of basic human motives to understand the world, avoid existential threat, and maintain valued interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name="jost2008"&gt;Jost, John T., Ledgerwood, Alison, &amp; Hardin, Curtis D. (2008). "Shared reality, system justification, and the relational basis of ideological beliefs." ''Social and Personality Psychology Compass'', 2, 171–186&lt;/ref&gt; These authors conclude that such motives may lead disproportionately to the adoption of [[system justification|system-justifying]] worldviews. Psychologists have generally found that [[personality traits]], individual difference variables, needs, and ideological beliefs seem to have a common thread.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Ideology and semiotic theory==
According to the semiotician [[Bob Hodge (linguist)|Bob Hodge]], ideology "identifies a unitary object that incorporates complex sets of meanings with the social agents and processes that produced them. No other term captures this object as well as 'ideology'. [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s '[[episteme]]' is too narrow and abstract, not social enough. His 'discourse', popular because it covers some of ideology's terrain with less baggage, is too confined to verbal systems. 'Worldview' is too metaphysical, 'propaganda' too loaded. Despite or because of its contradictions, 'ideology' still plays a key role in semiotics oriented to social, political life."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bob Hodge (linguist)|Bob Hodge]], [http://www.semioticon.com/seo/I/ideology.html# "Ideology"], at ''Semiotics Encyclopedia Online''.&lt;/ref&gt; Authors such as [[Michael Freeden]] have also recently incorporated a [[semantics|semantic]] analysis to the study of ideologies.

Sociologists define ideology as "cultural beliefs that justify particular social arrangements, including patterns of inequality."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sociology|last=Macionis|first=John J.|date=2010|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=9780205749898|edition=13th|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|pages=257|oclc=468109511}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dominant groups use these sets of cultural beliefs and practices to justify the systems of inequality that maintain their group's social power over non-dominant groups. Ideologies use a society's symbol system to organize social relations in a [[hierarchy]], with some social identities being superior to other social identities, which are considered inferior. The dominant ideology in a society is passed along through the society's major social institutions, such as the media, the family, education, and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=SOC 2018|last=Witt|first=Jon|publisher=MCGRAW-HILL|year=2017|isbn=978-1259702723|edition=5TH|location=[S.l.]|pages=65|oclc=968304061}}&lt;/ref&gt; As societies changed throughout history, so did the ideologies that justified systems of inequality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sociological examples of ideologies include: [[racism]]; [[sexism]]; [[heterosexism]]; [[ableism]]; and [[ethnocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=SOC 2018|last=Witt|first=John|publisher=MCGRAW-HILL|year=2017|isbn=978-1259702723|edition=5TH|location=[S.l.]|pages=|oclc=968304061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ref improve|date=January 2015}}
In [[computer science]], an '''in-place algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] which transforms input using no auxiliary [[data structure]].  However a small amount of extra storage space is allowed for auxiliary variables. The input is usually overwritten by the output as the algorithm executes. In-place algorithm updates input sequence only through replacement or swapping of elements. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called '''not-in-place''' or '''out-of-place'''.

In-place can have slightly different meanings.  In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers.  However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log ''n'') bits.  More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation.  Usually, this space is O(log ''n''), though sometimes anything in [[ Big_O_notation#Little-o_notation |o(''n'')]] is allowed.  Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used.  Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length.  In this article, we refer to total space complexity ([[Deterministic space|DSPACE]]), counting pointer lengths.  Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log ''n'' factor compared to an analysis that ignores the length of indices and pointers.  

An algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage.  Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed.  When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm.  In theory applications such as [[log-space reduction]]s, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is ''write-only'').

== Examples ==

Given an [[Array data structure|array]] &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; of ''n'' items, suppose we want an array that holds the same elements in reversed order and dispose of the original. One seemingly simple way to do this is to create a new array of equal size, fill it with copies from &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; in appropriate order and then delete &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.

  '''function''' reverse(a[0..n - 1])
      allocate b[0..n - 1]
      '''for''' i '''from''' 0 '''to''' n - 1
          b[n − 1 − i] := a[i]
      '''return''' b

Unfortunately, this requires O(''n'') extra space for having the arrays &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; available simultaneously. Also, allocation and deallocation are often slow operations. Since we no longer need &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, we can instead overwrite it with its own reversal using this in-place algorithm which will only need constant number (2) of integers for the auxiliary variables &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tmp&lt;/code&gt;, no matter how large the array is.

  '''function''' reverse_in_place(a[0..n-1])
      '''for''' i '''from''' 0 '''to''' floor((n-2)/2)
          tmp := a[i]
          a[i] := a[n − 1 − i]
          a[n − 1 − i] := tmp

As another example, many [[sorting algorithm]]s rearrange arrays into sorted order in-place, including: [[bubble sort]], [[comb sort]], [[selection sort]], [[insertion sort]], [[heapsort]], and [[Shell sort]].  These algorithms require only a few pointers, so their space complexity is {{math|O(log ''n'')}}.&lt;ref&gt;The bit space requirement of a pointer is {{math|O(log ''n'')}}, but pointer size can be considered a constant in most sorting applications.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quicksort]] operates in-place on the data to be sorted.  However, quicksort requires {{math|O(log ''n'')}} stack space pointers to keep track of the subarrays in its [[divide and conquer algorithm|divide and conquer]] strategy.  Consequently, quicksort needs {{math|O(log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'')}} additional space.  Although this non-constant space technically takes quicksort out of the in-place category, quicksort and other algorithms needing only {{math|O(log ''n'')}} additional pointers are usually considered in-place algorithms.

Most [[selection algorithm]]s are also in-place, although some considerably rearrange the input array in the process of finding the final, constant-sized result.

Some text manipulation algorithms such as [[Trim (programming)|trim]] and reverse may be done in-place.

== In computational complexity ==

In [[computational complexity theory]], the strict definition of in-place algorithms includes all algorithms with O(1) space complexity, the class '''[[Deterministic space|DSPACE]]'''(1). This class is very limited; it equals the [[regular language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Liśkiewicz and Rüdiger Reischuk. [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/34203.html The Complexity World below Logarithmic Space]. ''Structure in Complexity Theory Conference'', pp. 64-78. 1994. Online: p. 3, Theorem 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it does not even include any of the examples listed above.

We usually consider algorithms in [[L (complexity)|L]], the class of problems requiring O(log ''n'') additional space, to be in-place. This class is more in line with the practical definition, as it allows numbers of size n as pointers or indices.  This expanded definition still excludes quicksort, however, because of its recursive calls.  

Identifying the in-place algorithms with L has some interesting implications; for example, it means that there is a (rather complex) in-place algorithm to determine whether a path exists between two nodes in an [[undirected graph]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
 | last = Reingold | first = Omer | author-link = Omer Reingold

 | mr = 2445014
 | pages = 1–24
 | title = Undirected connectivity in log-space
 | volume = 55
 | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; a problem that requires O(''n'') extra space using typical algorithms such as [[depth-first search]] (a visited bit for each node). This in turn yields in-place algorithms for problems such as determining if a graph is [[bipartite graph|bipartite]] or testing whether two graphs have the same number of [[connected component (graph theory)|connected component]]s. See [[SL (complexity)|SL]] for more information.

== Role of randomness ==

In many cases, the space requirements for an algorithm can be drastically cut by using a [[randomized algorithm]]. For example, say we wish to know if two vertices in a graph of ''n'' vertices are in the same [[Connected component (graph theory)|connected component]] of the graph. There is no known simple, deterministic, in-place algorithm to determine this, but if we simply start at one vertex and perform a [[random walk]] of about 20''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; steps, the chance that we will stumble across the other vertex provided that it is in the same component is very high. Similarly, there are simple randomized in-place algorithms for primality testing such as the [[Miller-Rabin primality test]], and there are also simple in-place randomized factoring algorithms such as [[Pollard's rho algorithm]]. See [[RL (complexity)|RL]] and [[BPL (complexity)|BPL]] for more discussion of this phenomenon.

== In functional programming ==

[[Functional programming]] languages often discourage or don't support explicit in-place algorithms that overwrite data, since this is a type of [[side effect (computer science)|side effect]]; instead, they only allow new data to be constructed. However, good functional language compilers will often recognize when an object very similar to an existing one is created and then the old one thrown away, and will optimize this into a simple mutation "under-the-hood".

Note that it is possible in principle to carefully construct in-place algorithms that don't modify data (unless the data is no longer being used), but this is rarely done in practice.  See [[purely functional data structure]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6685">'''Ka Hsaw Wa''' (born 1970) is a Burmese [[human rights]] activist. He is a  member of the [[Karen people|Karen]] [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] group. Along with his wife, environmental and human rights attorney [[Katie Redford]], he is the co-founder and co-director of EarthRights International (ERI), an organization that focuses on human rights in Burma and other areas "where protection of human rights and the [[natural environment|environment]] is intrinsically connected."&lt;ref name="earthrights1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthrights.org/misc/ka_hsaw_wa_bio.html |title=Ka Hsaw Wa &amp;#124; EarthRights International |publisher=Earthrights.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ka Hsaw Wa and Katie Redford have two young children.

==Biography==
Ka Hsaw Wa was born under a different name, which he keeps secret in order to protect his family in [[Burma]].  He has not seen his parents in over 15 years. He adopted the name "Ka Hsaw Wa", which means "the White Elephant", while in exile in the United States. White Elephants are traditionally thought of by the [[Karen people]] as symbolizing righteousness and strength as well as a harbinger of great positive change.

Ka Hsaw Wa grew up in [[Burma]] as the son of a doctor and enjoyed relative economic privilege in his youth.  However, when he entered college he soon became active in political causes, and quickly developed into a strong student leader.  The Burmese government [[8888 Uprising|attacked the students brutally in 1988]], killing many.  Ka Hsaw Wa was captured and [[torture]]d.  He then left Burma, but re-entered the country in order to participate in a lengthy photographic campaign documenting environmental and indigenous destruction, as well as severe human rights abuses, including [[starvation]], [[systematic rape]], and the destruction of entire villages.  Most of the problems he documented were connected to the construction and operation of a [[petroleum]] [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] in the area of [[Yadana]] for the oil companies [[Unocal]] (U.S.-based) and [[Total S.A.]] (based in France).

Ka Hsaw Wa, Katie Redford and EarthRights launched a federal [[Katie Redford#Human Rights Law|lawsuit against Unocal]], employing a unique legal strategy utilizing the U.S. [[Alien Tort Statute]] of 1789, which says that "federal courts have jurisdiction for torts that occur in violation of the [[Law of Nations]], [which] includes abuses of fundamental human rights [and] genocide",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theconnection.org/shows/2003/09/20030930_b_main.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001230830/http://www.theconnection.org/shows/2003/09/20030930_b_main.asp |date=October 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to force the company to assume responsibility for human rights abuses caused by its actions. In the case [[Unocal]] eventually agreed to pay compensation to the 15 anonymous villagers who suffered forced labor, rape, and the effects of killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/14/business/14unocal.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=unocal+settles+burma&amp;st=nyt&amp;oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=Unocal Settles Rights Suit in Myanmar | date=2004-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ka Hsaw Wa continues his front-line activism, and was featured in the 2006 film, ''[[Total Denial]]''. A description based on his role in the film is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Ka Hsaw Wa dedicated his life to human rights activism, speaking fluent English and Burmese, dodging back and forth as he plays cat-and-mouse with the border guards, marrying another rights worker and even raising a family. All the while he is fighting to live and protect his homeland. At one point he describes how he was himself tortured. When he goes into difficult areas of the jungle, he takes a gun with a single bullet - to commit suicide if captured (to avoid torture)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0976178/ |title=Total Denial (2006) - IMDb |publisher=Uk.imdb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ka Hsaw Wa and EarthRights are also involved in the current struggle for democracy and human rights in Burma, wherein a number of protesters, including monks, have been killed, and hundreds of protesters arrested.  They are working to bring an end to the current violence against the people. In response to the 2007 protests, Ka Hsaw Wa has said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"As someone who experienced this regime's brutality in 1988, I am glad that this time around, the world is watching. But that is not enough. The international community, including multinational corporations, must act now to prevent further bloodshed in Burma. The people have suffered profoundly for too long — they have already sacrificed so much, and they will not stop."[http://watsonblogs.org/mak/]

'''Michael Thomas Rice Jr.''' (born February 13, 1969) is an American [[college basketball]] coach, formerly the head men's basketball coach at [[Robert Morris University]] and later [[Rutgers-New Brunswick|Rutgers University]]. He is the son of former college basketball coach and [[Portland Trail Blazers]] announcer [[Mike Rice (basketball)|Mike Rice]]. In 2009, he helped lead Robert Morris to its first [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] since 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Morris Clinches NCAA Tourney Bid|date=March 12, 2009|accessdate=March 12, 2009|publisher=ThePittsburghChannel|url=http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/sports/18866842/detail.html}}{{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rice gained national attention in 2013, when [[ESPN]] aired Rutgers practice videos showing the coach verbally and physically abusing players.

==Overview==
Rice was born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], to Kathy and Mike Rice. He attended [[Boardman High School]] in [[Boardman, Ohio]] where he was a three year starter as a basketball guard. He was a three-year starter for the [[Fordham University]] basketball team from 1988 to 1991 and was captain of the team his senior year when Fordham went to the [[National Invitation Tournament]]. He received a bachelor's degree in communication. After graduation he was an assistant coach at several programs including Fordham 1991–1994; [[Marquette University]] 1994–1997; [[Niagara University]] 1997–1998; [[Chicago State University]] 1998–2001; [[St. Joseph's University]] 2004–2006; and [[University of Pittsburgh]] 2006–2007. In addition he was associated with the Hoop Group in [[Neptune Township, New Jersey|Neptune, New Jersey]] from 2001 to 2004 where he was director of the Eastern Invitational Basketball Camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pittsburghpanthers.com/sports/m-baskbl/mtt/rice_mike00.html|title=Mike Rice Bio - PittsburghPanthers.com - University of Pittsburgh Official Athletic Site|publisher=PittsburghPanthers.com|accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scarletknights.com/basketball-men/news/release.asp?prID=9212#.UVw_P0rivFI |title=Mike Rice Named Rutgers University Head Men's Basketball Coach |publisher=Scarletknights.com |date=May 6, 2010 |accessdate=2013-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407080058/http://scarletknights.com/basketball-men/news/release.asp?prID=9212 |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, he became head coach at Robert Morris University, and in 2010 he became head coach of Rutgers University.

==Rutgers University suspension and firing==
On December 13, 2012, Rice was suspended three games without pay and fined $50,000 for abusive behavior toward his players. The suspension came after athletic director [[Tim Pernetti]] obtained video footage from a practice during either Rice's first or second season at Rutgers, at which Rice was seen throwing basketballs at players' heads and cursing at them. Assistant coach David Cox led the team during Rice's suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/rutgersbasketball/index.ssf/2012/12/mike_rice_suspended_by_rutgers.html|title=Rutgers suspended Mike Rice because school found coach threw basketballs at players' heads|last=Prunty|first=Brendan|publisher=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of the suspension, Rice was not only banned from any contact with his players or going on recruiting visits, but was banned from coming onto campus altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Andy|authorlink=Andy Katz|title=Mike Rice speaks out after suspension, fine|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/blog/_/name/katz_andy/id/8790174/rutgers-scarlet-knights-coach-mike-rice-vows-get-better-suspension-college-basketball|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pernetti characterized the suspension as "a complete removal from the program," but stated that Rice would return to Rutgers for the 2013-14 season pending a review of his behavior.&lt;ref&gt;ESPN, [http://espn.go.com/new-york/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/8744573/mike-rice-coach-rutgers-scarlet-knights-suspended-three-games-fined Mike Rice suspended, fined $50K]&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation changed dramatically on April 2, 2013, when [[ESPN]]'s ''[[Outside the Lines]]'' aired several hours of video from Rice's practices. According to ESPN, the video, provided to Pernetti by then-assistant coach [[Eric Murdock]], showed Rice berating, pushing, kicking, cursing, using [[homophobia|homophobic]] slurs, and throwing basketballs at players during practices.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, [https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/03/rutgers-fire-basketball-coach-mike-rice Rutgers' firing of coach Mike Rice exposes a toxic locker-room culture], 3 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Murdock said that he first told Pernetti about the abuse in the summer of 2012, but Pernetti took no action until he and other Rutgers officials saw the video in December. Murdock claims he was fired in July for reporting the abuse, and sued Rutgers for wrongful termination.&lt;ref&gt;via [[ESPN]]. [http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/9125796/practice-video-shows-rutgers-basketball-coach-mike-rice-berated-pushed-used-slurs-players "Rutgers' Rice Berates Players at Practice"], April 2, 2013. Accessed April 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; An independent investigation found that there was insufficient evidence to support Murdock's claims that Rice created a hostile work environment. It also found the video was not in context, since it depicted practices from Rice's first year at Rutgers. However, it did find that Rice's actions brought "shame and disgrace" to Rutgers–on paper, grounds to fire Rice for cause regardless of the merits of Murdock's claims.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/sports/ncaabasketball/rutgers-officials-long-knew-of-coach-mike-rices-actions.html|title=Rutgers Officials Long Knew of Coach’s Actions|author1=Steve Eder|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pernetti later said that his gut feeling had been to fire Rice on the spot, but ultimately concluded that Rutgers policy would not justify a firing.&lt;ref name=Record/&gt;

The video touched off a nationwide outcry, with [[Governor of New Jersey|New Jersey Governor]] [[Chris Christie]] condemning Rice's behavior, and [[New Jersey General Assembly|State Assembly]] Speaker [[Sheila Oliver]] among many demanding that Rice be fired.&lt;ref&gt;ESPN. [http://espn.go.com/new-york/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/9128825/rutgers-scarlet-knights-fire-coach-mike-rice-wake-video-scandal Rutgers fires coach Mike Rice]&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Rutgers fired Rice as head coach.&lt;ref name="ricefired"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scarletknights.com/basketball-men/news/release.asp?prID=13041#.UVw93KLqk84 |title=Mike Rice Relieved of Duties at Rutgers University |publisher=[[Rutgers University]] |date=April 3, 2013 |accessdate=April 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406045910/http://www.scarletknights.com/basketball-men/news/release.asp?prID=13041 |archivedate=April 6, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ''[[The Star-Ledger|The (Newark) Star-Ledger]]'', the move came after school president [[Robert L. Barchi|Robert Barchi]] saw the video for the first time, although he had signed off on Pernetti's decision to suspend Rice in December. When Barchi saw the video, he called in Pernetti and told him that Rice had to leave immediately.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/04/mike_rice_fired_rutgers_univer.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Barchi held Pernetti responsible for the debacle, and forced Pernetti's resignation two days later.&lt;ref name=Record&gt;{{cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409095655/http://www.northjersey.com/news/Sullivan_For_days_Rutgers_athletic_director_knew_he_would_have_to_go.html|title=For days, Rutgers athletic director knew he would have to go|author1=Tara Sullivan|publisher=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]|date=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a post-mortem of the circumstances leading to Rice's firing, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Rutgers officials were so focused on whether Rice created a hostile work environment for his assistants that they ignored "the larger question" of whether Rice's behavior toward his players in and of itself demanded his firing.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31935">In [[theoretical physics]], '''negative mass''' is matter whose [[mass]] is of opposite sign to the mass of normal matter, e.g. −1&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/negative-mass-object-washington-state-physics-isaac-newton-upside-down-a7693701.html "Scientists observe liquid with 'negative mass', which turns physics completely upside down"], ''The Independent'', April 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/fluid-negative-mass-1.4073937 "Scientists create fluid that seems to defy physics:'Negative mass' reacts opposite to any known physical property we know"], ''CBC'', April 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Such matter would violate one or more [[energy condition]]s and show some strange properties, stemming from the ambiguity as to whether attraction should refer to force or the oppositely oriented acceleration for negative mass. It is used in certain speculative [[hypothesis]], such as on the construction of traversable [[wormhole]]s and the [[Alcubierre drive]]. Initially, the closest known real representative of such exotic matter is a region of [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]] density produced by the [[Casimir effect]].

[[General relativity]] describes [[gravity]] and the [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] for both positive and [[negative energy]] particles, hence negative mass, but does not include the other [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]]. On the other hand, the [[Standard Model]] describes [[elementary particle]]s and the other fundamental forces, but it does not include gravity. A unified theory that explicitly includes gravity along with the other fundamental forces may be needed for a better understanding of the concept of negative mass.

==In general relativity==
Negative mass is any region of space in which for some observers the mass density is measured to be negative. This could occur due to a region of space in which the stress component of the Einstein [[stress–energy tensor]] is larger in magnitude than the mass density. All of these are violations of one or another variant of the positive [[energy condition]] of Einstein's general theory of relativity; however, the positive energy condition is not a required condition for the mathematical consistency of the theory.

===Inertial versus gravitational mass===

Ever since [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] first formulated his theory of [[gravity]], there have been at least three conceptually distinct quantities called [[mass]]:
*[[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]] &amp;ndash; the mass ''m'' that appears in Newton's second law of motion, '''F'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;thinsp;'''a'''
*“active” [[gravitational mass]] &amp;ndash; the mass that produces a gravitational field that other masses respond to 
*“passive” gravitational mass &amp;ndash; the mass that responds to an external gravitational field by accelerating.

Einstein’s [[equivalence principle]] postulates that inertial mass must equal passive gravitational mass. The law of [[Momentum|conservation of momentum]] requires that active and passive gravitational mass be identical. All experimental evidence to date has found these are, indeed, always the same. In considering negative mass, it is important to consider which of these concepts of mass are negative. In most analyses of negative mass, it is assumed that the equivalence principle and conservation of momentum continue to apply, and therefore all three forms of mass are still the same.

In his 4th-prize essay for the 1951 [[Gravity Research Foundation]] competition, [[Joaquin Mazdak Luttinger]] considered the possibility of negative mass and how it would behave under gravitational and other forces.&lt;ref name="Luttinger 1951"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Luttinger |first=J. M. |year=1951 |title=On "Negative" mass in the theory of gravitation |url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5852e579be659442a01f27b8/t/5873dc04d1758eea4b41c720/1483987972731/luttinger.pdf |journal=Awards for Essays on Gravitation |publisher=Gravity Research Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, following Luttinger's idea, [[Hermann Bondi]] suggested in a paper in ''[[Reviews of Modern Physics]]'' that mass might be negative as well as positive.&lt;ref name="Bondi 1957"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.29.423 |title=Negative Mass in General Relativity |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=423 |year=1957 |last1=Bondi |first1=H. |bibcode=1957RvMP...29..423B }}&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out that this does not entail a logical contradiction, as long as all three forms of mass are negative, but that the assumption of negative mass involves some counter-intuitive form of motion. For example, an object with negative inertial mass would be expected to accelerate in the opposite direction to that in which it was pushed (non-gravitationally).

There have been several other analyses of negative mass, such as the studies conducted by R. M. Price,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Price|first1=R. M.|title=Negative mass can be positively amusing|journal=Am. J. Phys.|date=1993|volume=61|issue=3|page=216|doi=10.1119/1.17293 |url=http://people.westminstercollege.edu/faculty/ccline/courses/resources/wp/pdf/AJP000216.pdf|bibcode = 1993AmJPh..61..216P }}&lt;/ref&gt; however none addressed the question of what kind of energy and momentum would be necessary to describe non-singular negative mass. Indeed, the Schwarzschild solution for negative mass parameter has a naked singularity at a fixed spatial position. The question that immediately comes up is, would it not be possible to smooth out the singularity with some kind of negative mass density. The answer is yes, but not with energy and momentum that satisfies the [[Energy condition#Dominant energy condition|dominant energy condition]]. This is because if the energy and momentum satisfies the dominant energy condition within a spacetime that is asymptotically flat, which would be the case of smoothing out the singular negative mass Schwarzschild solution, then it must satisfy the positive energy theorem, i.e. its [[ADM formalism|ADM mass]] must be positive, which is of course not the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shoen|first1=R.|last2=Yao|first2=S.-T.|title=On the proof of the positive mass conjecture in general relativity|journal=Commun. Math. Phys.|date=1979|volume=65|pages=45–76 |url=http://www.doctoryau.com/papers/PositiveMassConjecture.pdf|bibcode = 1979CMaPh..65...45S |doi = 10.1007/BF01940959 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Witten|first1=Edward|title=A new proof of the positive energy theorem|journal=Comm.

===Runaway motion===
Although no particles are known to have negative mass, physicists (primarily [[Hermann Bondi]] in 1957,&lt;ref name="Bondi 1957" /&gt; [[William B. Bonnor]] in 1989,&lt;ref name="Bonnor 1989"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00763458| title = Negative mass in general relativity| journal = General Relativity and Gravitation| volume = 21| issue = 11| pages = 1143| year = 1989| last1 = Bonnor | first1 = W. B.|bibcode = 1989GReGr..21.1143B }}&lt;/ref&gt; then [[Robert L. Forward]]&lt;ref name="Forward 1990"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2514/3.23219| title = Negative matter propulsion| journal = Journal of Propulsion and Power| volume = 6| pages = 28| year = 1990| last1 = Forward | first1 = R. L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;) have been able to describe some of the anticipated properties such particles may have. Assuming that all three concepts of mass are equivalent the gravitational interactions between masses of arbitrary sign can be explored, based on the [[Einstein field equations]] and the [[equivalence principle]]:

* Positive mass attracts both other positive masses and negative masses.
* Negative mass repels  both other negative masses and positive masses.

For two positive masses, nothing changes and there is a gravitational pull on each other causing an attraction. Two negative masses would repel because of their negative inertial masses. For different signs however, there is a push that repels the positive mass from the negative mass, and a pull that attracts the negative mass towards the positive one at the same time.

Hence Bondi pointed out that two objects of equal and opposite mass would produce a constant acceleration of the system towards the positive-mass object,&lt;ref name="Bondi 1957" /&gt; an effect called "runaway motion" by Bonnor who disregarded its physical existence, stating: 
{{Centered pull quote
 |I regard the runaway (or self-accelerating) motion […] so preposterous that I prefer to rule it out by supposing that inertial mass is all positive or all negative.
|author= William B. Bonnor
|source=in ''Negative mass in general relativity''.&lt;ref name="Bonnor 1989" /&gt;}}

Such a couple of objects would accelerate without limit (except relativistic one); however, the total mass, momentum and energy of the system would remain 0.

This behavior is completely inconsistent with a common-sense approach and the expected behaviour of 'normal' matter; but is completely mathematically consistent and introduces no violation of conservation of momentum or [[conservation of energy|energy]]. If the masses are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, then the momentum of the system remains zero if they both travel together and accelerate together, no matter what their speed:

:&lt;math&gt;p_\mathrm{sys} = mv + (-m)v = \big(m+(-m)\big)v = 0\times v = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

And equivalently for the [[kinetic energy]]:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{k,sys} = \tfrac12 mv^2 + \tfrac12(-m)v^2 = \tfrac12\big(m+(-m)\big)v^2 = \tfrac12(0)v^2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

However, this is perhaps not exactly valid if the energy in the gravitational field is taken into account.

Forward extended Bondi's analysis to additional cases, and showed that even if the two masses {{math|''m''&lt;sup&gt;(−)&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''m''&lt;sup&gt;(+)&lt;/sup&gt;}} are not the same, the conservation laws remain unbroken. This is true even when relativistic effects are considered, so long as inertial mass, not rest mass, is equal to gravitational mass.

This behaviour can produce bizarre results: for instance, a gas containing a mixture of positive and negative matter particles will have the positive matter portion increase in [[temperature]] without bound. However, the negative matter portion gains negative temperature at the same rate, again balancing out. [[Geoffrey A. Landis]] pointed out other implications of Forward's analysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=G.|last= Landis|title=Comments on Negative Mass Propulsion|journal=J. Propulsion and Power|volume= 7|issue= 2|pages= 304 |year=1991|doi=10.2514/3.23327}}&lt;/ref&gt; including noting that although negative mass particles would repel each other gravitationally, the [[electrostatic force]] would be attractive for like [[charge (physics)|charges]] and repulsive for opposite charges.

Forward used the properties of negative-mass matter to create the concept of diametric drive, a design for [[spacecraft propulsion]] using negative mass that requires no energy input and no [[Working mass|reaction mass]] to achieve arbitrarily high acceleration.

Forward also coined a term, "nullification", to describe what happens when ordinary matter and negative matter meet: they are expected to be able to cancel out or nullify each other's existence. An interaction between equal quantities of positive mass matter (hence of positive energy {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) and negative mass matter (of negative energy {{math|−''E'' {{=}} −''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) would release no energy, but because the only configuration of such particles that has zero momentum (both particles moving with the same velocity in the same direction) does not produce a collision, all such interactions would leave a surplus of momentum, which is classically forbidden. So once this runaway phenomenon has been revealed, the [[scientific community]] considered negative mass could not exist in the universe.

===Arrow of time and energy inversion===
In 1970, [[Jean-Marie Souriau]] demonstrated, through the complete [[Poincaré group]] of dynamic [[group theory]], that reversing the energy of a particle (hence its mass, if the particle has one) is equal to reversing its [[arrow of time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Souriau |first=J.-M. |date=1970 |title=Structure des Systèmes Dynamiques |trans-title=Structure of Dynamic Systems |url=http://www.jmsouriau.com/structure_des_systemes_dynamiques.htm |location=Paris |publisher=Dunod |page=199 |language=French |issn=0750-2435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Souriau |first=J.-M. |title=Structure of Dynamical Systems |chapter=A mechanistic description of elementary particles: Inversions of space and time |location=Boston |publisher=Birkhäuser |date=1997 |isbn=978-1-4612-6692-1 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0281-3_14 |url=http://ayuba.fr/souriau/Souriau-time-energy-mass-inversion.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The universe according to [[general relativity]] is a [[Riemannian manifold]] associated to a [[metric tensor]] solution of Einstein’s field equations. In such a framework, the runaway motion prevents the existence of negative matter.&lt;ref name="Bondi 1957" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonnor 1989" /&gt;

Some [[bimetric theory|bimetric theories]] of the universe propose that two [[multiverse|parallel universes]] instead of one may exist with an opposite arrow of time, linked together by the [[Big Bang]] and interacting only through [[gravitation]].&lt;ref name="Sakharov 1980"&gt;A.D.

According to group theory, the matter of the [[Topological conjugacy|conjugated]] metric would appear to the matter of the other metric as having opposite mass and arrow of time (though its [[proper time]] would remain positive). The coupled metrics have their own [[geodesic]]s and are solutions of two coupled field equations:&lt;ref name="Petit 2014a"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10509-014-2106-5 |title=Negative mass hypothesis in cosmology and the nature of dark energy |journal=Astrophysics and Space Science |volume=354 |issue=2 |pages=611 |year=2014 |last1=Petit |first1=J.

The [[Post-Newtonian expansion|Newtonian approximation]] then provides the following interaction laws:
* Positive mass attracts positive mass.
* Negative mass attracts negative mass.
* Positive mass and negative mass repel each other.
Those laws are different to the laws described by Bondi and Bonnor, and solve the runaway paradox. The negative matter of the coupled metric, interacting with the matter of the other metric via gravity, could be an alternative candidate for the explanation of [[dark matter]], [[dark energy]], [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]] and [[accelerating universe]].&lt;ref name="Petit 2014a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Petit 2014b" /&gt;

===In Gauss's law of gravity===
In [[electromagnetism]] one can derive the energy density of a field from [[Gauss's law]], assuming the curl of the field is 0. Performing the same calculation using [[Gauss's law for gravity]] produces a negative energy density for a gravitational field.

===Gravitational interaction of antimatter===
{{Main|Gravitational interaction of antimatter}}
The overwhelming consensus among physicists is that [[antimatter]] has positive mass and should be affected by gravity just like normal matter. Direct experiments on neutral [[antihydrogen]] have not been sensitive enough to detect any difference between the gravitational interaction of antimatter, compared to normal matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/ncomms2787 |pmid=23653197 |pmc=3644108 |title=Description and first application of a new technique to measure the gravitational mass of antihydrogen |journal=Nature Communications |volume=4 |pages=1785 |year=2013 |last1=Amole |first1=C. |last2=Ashkezari |first2=M.

[[Bubble chamber]] experiments provide further evidence that antiparticles have the same inertial mass as their normal counterparts. In these experiments, the chamber is subjected to a constant magnetic field that causes charged particles to travel in [[Helix|helical]] paths, the radius and direction of which correspond to the ratio of electric charge to inertial mass. Particle–antiparticle pairs are seen to travel in helices with opposite directions but identical radii, implying that the ratios differ only in sign; but this does not indicate whether it is the charge or the inertial mass that is inverted. However, particle–antiparticle pairs are observed to electrically attract one another. This behavior implies that both have positive inertial mass and opposite charges; if the reverse were true, then the particle with positive inertial mass would be repelled from its antiparticle partner.

==Experimentation==
Physicist Peter Engels and a team of colleagues at [[Washington State University]] claimed to have observed negative mass behavior in rubidium atoms. On 10 April 2017 Engels team created negative "effective" mass by reducing the temperature of rubidium atoms to near [[absolute zero]], generating a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]. By using a laser-trap, the team were able to reverse the spin of some of the rubidium atoms in this state, and observed that once released from the trap, the atoms expanded and displayed properties of negative mass, in particular accelerating towards a pushing force instead of away from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39642992|title=Physicists observe 'negative mass'|date=2017-04-19|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-04-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.155301 |pmid=28452531 |title=Negative-Mass Hydrodynamics in a Spin-Orbit–coupled Bose–Einstein Condensate |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=118 |issue=15 |pages=155301 |year=2017 |last1=Khamehchi |first1=M. A. |last2=Hossain |first2=Khalid |last3=Mossman |first3=M. E. |last4=Zhang |first4=Yongping |last5=Busch |first5=Th. |last6=Forbes |first6=Michael Mcneil |last7=Engels |first7=P. |bibcode=2017PhRvL.118o5301K |arxiv=1612.04055 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This kind of negative effective mass is analogous to the well-known apparent negative effective mass of electrons in the upper part of the dispersion bands in solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashcroft|first1=N. W.|last2=Mermin|first2=N. D.|title=Solid State Physics|date=1976|publisher=Saunders College|location=Philadelphia|pages=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, neither case is negative mass for the purposes of the [[stress–energy tensor]].

Some recent work with [[metamaterial]]s suggests that some as-yet-undiscovered composite of superconductors, metamaterials and normal matter could exhibit signs of negative effective mass in much the same way as low temperature alloys melt at below the melting point of their components or some semiconductors have negative differential resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2014.10.036 |title=Novel negative mass density resonant metamaterial unit cell |journal=Physics Letters A |volume=379 |pages=33 |year=2015 |last1=Cselyuszka |first1=Norbert |last2=Sečujski |first2=Milan |last3=Crnojević-Bengin |first3=Vesna |bibcode=2015PhLA..379...33C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In quantum mechanics==
In 1928, [[Paul Dirac]]'s theory of [[elementary particle]]s, now part of the [[Standard Model]], already included negative solutions.&lt;ref name="Dirac 1928"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspa.1928.0023 |title=The Quantum Theory of the Electron |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences |volume=117 |issue=778 |pages=610 |year=1928 |last1=Dirac |first1=P. A. M. |bibcode=1928RSPSA.117..610D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Standard Model]] is a generalization of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) and negative mass is already built into the theory.

[[Mike Morris (physicist)|Morris]], [[Kip Thorne|Thorne]] and Yurtsever&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.1446 |pmid=10038800 |title=Wormholes, Time Machines, and the Weak Energy Condition |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=61 |issue=13 |pages=1446–1449 |year=1988 |last1=Morris |first1=Michael S. |last2=Thorne |first2=Kip S. |last3=Yurtsever |first3=Ulvi |bibcode=1988PhRvL..61.1446M }}&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that the quantum mechanics of the [[Casimir effect]] can be used to produce a locally mass-negative region of space–time. In this article, and subsequent work by others, they showed that negative matter could be used to stabilize a [[wormhole]]. Cramer ''et al.'' argue that such wormholes might have been created in the early universe, stabilized by negative-mass loops of [[cosmic string]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=astro-ph/9409051 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.51.3117 |title=Natural wormholes as gravitational lenses |journal=Physical Review D |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=3117 |year=1995 |last1=Cramer |first1=John G. |last2=Forward |first2=Robert L. |last3=Morris |first3=Michael S. |last4=Visser |first4=Matt |last5=Benford |first5=Gregory |last6=Landis |first6=Geoffrey A. |bibcode=1995PhRvD..51.3117C }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Hawking]] has proved that [[negative energy]] is a necessary condition for the creation of a [[closed timelike curve]] by manipulation of gravitational fields within a finite region of space;&lt;ref name="futureofspacetime"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hawking | first = Stephen | title = The Future of Spacetime | publisher = W. W. Norton |year= 2002 | pages = 96 | isbn = 0-393-02022-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; this proves, for example, that a finite [[Tipler cylinder]] cannot be used as a [[Time travel|time machine]].

===Schrödinger equation===
For energy eigenstates of the [[Schrödinger equation]], the wavefunction is wavelike wherever the particle's energy is greater than the local potential, and exponential-like (evanescent) wherever it is less. Naively, this would imply kinetic energy is negative in evanescent regions (to cancel the local potential). However, kinetic energy is an operator in [[quantum mechanics]], and its expectation value is always positive, summing with the expectation value of the potential energy to yield the energy eigenvalue.

For wavefunctions of particles with zero rest mass (such as [[photon]]s), this means that any evanescent portions of the wavefunction would be associated with a local negative mass–energy. However, the Schrödinger equation does not apply to massless particles; instead the [[Klein–Gordon equation]] is required.

==In special relativity==
{{See also|Exotic matter|Faster-than-light}}
One can achieve a negative mass independent of [[negative energy]]. According to [[mass–energy equivalence]], mass {{mvar|m}} is in proportion to energy {{mvar|E}} and the coefficient of proportionality is {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Actually, {{mvar|m}} is still equivalent to {{mvar|E}} although the coefficient is another constant &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Wang, Z.Y, Wang P.Y, Xu Y.R.| date=2011 | title=Crucial experiment to resolve Abraham–Minkowski Controversy | journal=Optik | volume=122 | pages=1994–1996 | doi=10.1016/j.ijleo.2010.12.018 | issue= 22| bibcode=2011Optik.122.1994W | arxiv=1103.3559 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as {{math|−''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wang, Z.Y.|title=Modern Theory for Electromagnetic Metamaterials|journal=Plasmonics|date=2016|volume=11|pages=503–508|doi=10.1007/s11468-015-0071-7|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case, it is unnecessary to introduce a [[negative energy]] because the mass can be negative although the energy is positive. That is to say,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
E&amp;=-mc^2&gt;0 \\
m&amp;= -\frac{E}{c^2}&lt;0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Under the circumstances,

:&lt;math&gt;dE=F\,ds=\frac{dp}{dt}\,ds=\frac{ds}{dt}\,dp=v\,dp=v\,d(mv)&lt;/math&gt;

and so,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
-c^2\,dm&amp;=v\,d(mv) \\
-c^2(2m)\,dm&amp;=2mv\,d(mv) \\
-c^2\,d(m^2)&amp;=d(m^2v^2) \\
-m^2c^2&amp;=m^2v^2+C
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

When {{math|''v'' {{=}} 0}},

:&lt;math&gt;C=-m_0^2c^2&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
-m^2c^2&amp;=m^2v^2-m_0^2c^2 \\
m&amp;=\frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1+\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0}} is [[invariant mass]] and [[invariant energy]] equals {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} −''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 0}}. The squared mass is still positive and the particle can be stable.

From the above relation,

:&lt;math&gt;p=mv= \frac{m_0 v}{\sqrt{1+\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;

The [[negative momentum]] is applied to explain [[negative refraction]], the [[inverse Doppler effect]] and the [[reverse Cherenkov effect]] observed in a [[negative index metamaterial]]. The [[radiation pressure]] in the [[metamaterial]] is also negative&lt;ref name="Veselago1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veselago|first=V. G.|title=The electrodynamics of substances with simultaneously negative values of permittivity and permeability|journal=Soviet Physics Uspekhi|year=1968|volume=10|issue=4|pages=509–514 |doi=10.1070/PU1968v010n04ABEH003699|bibcode = 1968SvPhU..10..509V }}&lt;/ref&gt; because the force is defined as {{math|''F'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''dp''|''dt''}}}}. [[Pressure#Negative pressures|Negative pressure]] exists in [[dark energy]] too. Using these above equations, the [[energy–momentum relation]] should be

:&lt;math&gt;E^2 =- p^2c^2+ m_0^2 c^4&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the [[Planck–Einstein relation]] {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''ħω''}} and [[de Broglie]]'s {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''ħk''}}, we obtain the following [[dispersion relation]] 
 
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^2 =- k^2c^2+ \omega_\mathrm{p}^2\,, \quad \left(E_0=\hbar\omega_\mathrm{p}=-m_0c^2&gt;0\right)&lt;/math&gt;

when the wave consists of a stream of particles whose [[energy–momentum relation]] is &lt;math&gt;E^2 =- p^2c^2+ m_0^2 c^4&lt;/math&gt; ([[wave–particle duality]]) and can be excited in a [[negative index metamaterial]]. The velocity of such a particle is equal to

:&lt;math&gt;v=c\sqrt{\frac{E_0^2}{E^2}-1}=c\sqrt{\frac{\omega_\mathrm{p}^2}{\omega^2}-1}&lt;/math&gt;

and range is from zero to infinity

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\omega_\mathrm{p}^2}{\omega^2}&amp;&lt;2\,, \quad\mbox{when }v&lt;c \\
\frac{\omega_\mathrm{p}^2}{\omega^2}&amp;&gt;2\,, \quad\mbox{when }v&gt;c
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, the [[kinetic energy]] is also negative

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
E_\mathrm{k} &amp;= E-E_0 \\
&amp;=-mc^2-\left(-m_0 c^2\right) \\
&amp;=-\frac{m_0c^2}{\sqrt{1+\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} + m_0 c^2 \\
&amp;= m_0 c^2 \left(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\right)&lt;0\,, \quad \left(\mbox{where }m_0&lt;0\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, [[negative kinetic energy]] exists in some models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Caldwell|first=R. R.|title=A phantom menace? Cosmological consequences of a dark energy component with super-negative equation of state|journal=Physics Letters B|volume=545|pages=23–29|date=2002|doi=10.1016/S0370-2693(02)02589-3|issue=1–2|arxiv = astro-ph/9908168 |bibcode = 2002PhLB..545...23C }}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe [[dark energy]] ([[phantom energy]]) whose pressure is negative. In this way, the negative mass of exotic matter is now associated with [[negative momentum]], [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]], [[negative kinetic energy]] and [[faster-than-light]] phenomena.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3691">'''Negative transference''' is the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] term for the [[transference]] of negative and hostile feelings, rather than positive ones, onto a therapist (or other emotional object).

==Freud's preference==
In his pioneering studies of transference phenomena, [[Freud]] noted the existence of both positive and negative transferences, while expressing a preference for the former, which he initially saw as a prerequisite for analytic work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Janet Malcolm]], ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (1988) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Freud considered that "The hostile feelings make their appearance as a rule later than the affectionate ones and behind them";&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 495&lt;/ref&gt; and more frequently in same-sex than in mixed-sex analytic pairings.

[[Otto Fenichel]] pointed out that whereas neurotic aggravations can follow the emergence of a negative transference, so too (paradoxically) can improvements: the patient gets better to spite the therapist for emphasising the patient's problems.&lt;ref&gt;O. Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 559-60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later formulations==
[[Melanie Klein]] in her disputes with [[Anna Freud]] laid much greater emphasis than her opponent on the constructive role to be played by interpreting the negative transference.&lt;ref&gt;C. Frank, ''Melanie Klein in Berlin'' (2009) p. 33-9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Lacan]] followed her theoretical lead in seeing "the [[Psychological projection|projection]] of what Melanie Klein calls ''bad internal objects''" as key to "the negative transference that is the initial knot of the analytic drama"&lt;ref&gt;J. Lacan, ''Écrits'' (1997) p. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; - though he himself would face criticism for glossing over the negative transference in training analyses, to keep his analysands in dependence.&lt;ref&gt;D. Macey, Introduction, J. Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) p. xii&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. R. D. Fairbairn]] was also more interested in the negative than the positive transference, which he saw as a key to the [[Repetition compulsion|repetition]] and exposure of unconscious attachments to internalised bad objects.&lt;ref&gt;M. Stark, ''Working with Resistance'' (2002) p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; In his wake, [[object relations theory|object relations theorists]] have tended to stress the positive results that can emerge from working with the negative transference.&lt;ref&gt;P. Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 112-3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nous''''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|n|aʊ|s}},&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles|edition=3 |page=1417|year=1973|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|US|n|uː|s}}), sometimes equated to [[intellect]] or [[intelligence]], is a term from classical [[philosophy]] for the faculty of the human [[mind]] necessary for understanding what is [[truth|true]] or [[reality|real]]. English words such as "[[understanding]]" are sometimes used, but three commonly used philosophical terms come directly from classical languages: [[wiktionary:νοῦς|''νοῦς'']] or [[wiktionary:νόος|''νόος'']] (from [[Ancient Greek|Ancient Greek)]], ''[[wikt:intellectus|intellēctus]]'' and ''[[wiktionary:intellegentia|intellegentia]]'' (from [[Latin]]). To describe the activity of this faculty, the word "intellection" is sometimes used in philosophical contexts, as well as the Greek words ''noēsis'' and ''noeîn'' (''[[wiktionary:νόησις|νόησις]]'', [[wiktionary:νοεῖν|''νοεῖν'']]). This activity is understood in a similar way (at least in some contexts) to the modern concept of [[intuition (philosophy)|intuition]].

In philosophy, common English translations include "understanding" and "mind"; or sometimes  "[[thought]]" or "[[reason]]" (in the sense of that which reasons, not the activity of reasoning).&lt;ref&gt;See entry for ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dno%2Fos νόος]'' in [[Liddell &amp; Scott]], on the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See entry for ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dintellectus2 intellectus]'' in [[Lewis &amp; Short]], on the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is also often described as something equivalent to [[perception]] except that it works within the mind ("the [[mind's eye]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature|last=Rorty|first=Richard|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1979}} page 38.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the basic meaning is something like "awareness".&lt;ref&gt;"This quest for the beginnings proceeds through sense perception, reasoning, and what they call noesis, which is literally translated by "understanding" or intellect," and which we can perhaps translate a little bit more cautiously by "awareness," an awareness of the mind's eye as distinguished from sensible awareness." {{citation|chapter=Progress or Return|title=An Introduction to Political Philosophy: Ten Essays by Leo Strauss| editor=Hilail Gilden |publication-place= Detroit|publisher=Wayne State UP|year=1989|last=Strauss|first=Leo}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In colloquial [[British English]], ''nous'' also denotes "[[good sense]]", which is close to one everyday meaning it had in [[Ancient Greece]].

[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|right|250px|upright=2.0|This diagram shows the medieval understanding of [[celestial spheres|spheres]] of the [[cosmos]], derived from [[Aristotle]], and as per the standard explanation by [[Ptolemy]]. It came to be understood that at least the outermost sphere (marked "[[Primum Mobile|Primũ Mobile]]") has its own intellect, intelligence or ''nous'' - a cosmic equivalent to the human mind.]]
In [[Aristotle]]'s influential works, the term was carefully distinguished from sense perception, imagination, and reason, although these terms are closely inter-related. The term was apparently already singled out by earlier philosophers such as [[Parmenides]], whose works are largely lost. In post-Aristotelian discussions, the exact boundaries between perception, understanding of perception, and reasoning have not always agreed with the definitions of Aristotle, even though his terminology remains influential.

In the Aristotelian scheme, ''nous'' is the basic understanding or awareness that allows human beings to think rationally. For Aristotle, this was distinct from the processing of sensory perception, including the use of imagination and memory, which other animals can do. This therefore connects discussion of ''nous'' to discussion of how the human mind sets definitions in a consistent and communicable way, and whether people must be born with some innate potential to understand the same [[universals|universal]] [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]] in the same logical ways. Deriving from this it was also sometimes argued, especially in classical and medieval philosophy, that the individual ''nous'' must require help of a spiritual and divine type. By this type of account, it came to be argued that the human understanding (''nous'') somehow stems from this cosmic ''nous'', which is however not just a recipient of order, but a creator of it. Such explanations were influential in the development of medieval accounts of [[God]], the [[immortality of the soul]], and even the [[Celestial spheres|motions of the stars]], in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, amongst both eclectic philosophers and authors representing all the major faiths of their times.

==Pre-Socratic usage==
[[File:Anger of achilles.jpg|thumb|right|The earliest surviving text that uses the word ''nous'' is the ''[[Iliad]]''. [[Agamemnon]] says to [[Achilles]]: "Do not thus, mighty though you are, godlike Achilles, seek to deceive me with your wit (''nous''); for you will not get by me nor persuade me."&lt;ref&gt;This is from [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D1%3Acard%3D130 I.130], the translation is by A.T. Murray, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In early Greek uses, [[Homer]] used ''nous'' to signify mental activities of both [[Human|mortal]]s and immortals, for example what they really have on their mind as opposed to what they say aloud. It was one of several words related to thought, thinking, and perceiving with the mind. In [[pre-Socratic philosophy]], it became increasingly distinguished as a source of knowledge and reasoning opposed to mere sense perception or thinking influenced by the body such as emotion. For example, [[Heraclitus]] complained that "much learning does not teach ''nous''".&lt;ref name=Long&gt;{{citation |title=Nous|last=Long|first=A.A.|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/A075.htm| year=1998|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among some Greek authors, a faculty of intelligence known as a "higher mind" came to be considered as a property of the [[cosmos]] as a whole.

The work of [[Parmenides]] set the scene for Greek philosophy to come and the concept of ''nous'' was central to his radical proposals. He claimed that reality as the senses perceive it is not a world of truth at all, because sense perception is so unreliable, and what is perceived is so uncertain and changeable. Instead he argued for a [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] wherein ''nous'' and related words (the verb for thinking which describes its mental perceiving activity, ''noein'', and the unchanging and eternal objects of this perception, ''noēta'') describe a form of perception which is not physical, but intellectual only, distinct from sense perception and the objects of sense perception.
[[File:Anaxagoras Lebiedzki Rahl.jpg|thumb|right|[[Anaxagoras]]]]
[[Anaxagoras]], born about 500 BC, is the first person who is definitely known to have explained the concept of a ''nous'' (mind), which arranged all other things in the cosmos in their proper order, started them in a rotating motion, and continuing to control them to some extent, having an especially strong connection with living things. (However Aristotle reports an earlier philosopher, [[Hermotimus of Clazomenae]], who had taken a similar position.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' I.4.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.+Met.+1.984b 984b].&lt;/ref&gt;) Amongst the pre-Socratic philosophers before Anaxagoras, other philosophers had proposed a similar ordering human-like principle causing life and the rotation of the heavens. For example, [[Empedocles]], like [[Hesiod]] much earlier, described cosmic order and living things as caused by a cosmic version of [[love]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Presocratic Philosophers|edition=second|last1=Kirk|last2=Raven|last3=Schofield|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1983}} Chapter X.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pythagoras]] and Heraclitus, attributed the cosmos with "reason" (''[[logos]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Presocratic Philosophers|edition=second|last1=Kirk|last2=Raven|last3=Schofield|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1983}}. See pages 204 and 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Anaxagoras the [[cosmos]] is made of infinitely divisible matter, every bit of which can inherently become anything, except Mind (''nous''), which is also matter, but which can only be found separated from this general mixture, or else mixed into living things, or in other words in the Greek terminology of the time, things with a soul (''psychē'').&lt;ref name=KirkRavenXII&gt;{{citation |title=The Presocratic Philosophers|edition=second|last1=Kirk|last2=Raven|last3=Schofield|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1983}} Chapter XII.&lt;/ref&gt; Anaxagoras wrote:
{{quote|All other things partake in a portion of everything, while ''nous'' is infinite and self-ruled, and is mixed with nothing, but is alone, itself by itself. For if it were not by itself, but were mixed with anything else, it would partake in all things if it were mixed with any; for in everything there is a portion of everything, as has been said by me in what goes before, and the things mixed with it would hinder it, so that it would have power over nothing in the same way that it has now being alone by itself. For it is the thinnest of all things and the purest, and it has all knowledge about everything and the greatest strength; and ''nous'' has power over all things, both greater and smaller, that have soul [''psychē''].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/greek-texts/ancient-greece/anaxagoras-nous.asp Anaxagoras, DK B 12], trans. by  J. Burnet&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Concerning [[cosmology]], Anaxagoras, like some Greek philosophers already before him, believed the cosmos was revolving, and had formed into its visible order as a result of such revolving causing a separating and mixing of different types of [[chemical element]]s. ''Nous'', in his system, originally caused this revolving motion to start, but it does not necessarily continue to play a role once the mechanical motion has started. His description was in other words (shockingly for the time) corporeal or mechanical, with the [[moon]] made of earth, the sun and stars made of red hot metal (beliefs Socrates was later accused of holding during his trial) and ''nous'' itself being a physical fine type of matter which also gathered and concentrated with the development of the cosmos. This ''nous'' (mind) is not incorporeal; it is the thinnest of all things. The distinction between ''nous'' and other things nevertheless causes his scheme to sometimes be described as a peculiar kind of dualism.&lt;ref name=KirkRavenXII/&gt;

Anaxagoras' concept of ''nous'' was distinct from later platonic and neoplatonic cosmologies in many ways, which were also influenced by [[Eleatics|Eleatic]], [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] and other pre-Socratic ideas, as well as the Socratics themselves.

In some schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], a "higher mind" came to be considered a property of the cosmos as a whole that exists within all matter (known as buddhi or mahat). In [[Samkhya]], this faculty of intellect ([[buddhi]]) serves to differentiate matter ([[prakrti]]) from pure consciousness ([[purusha]]). The lower aspect of mind that corresponds to the senses is referred to as "[[Manas-vijnana|manas]]".

==Socratic philosophy==

===Xenophon===
[[Xenophon]], the less famous of the two students of Socrates whose written accounts of him have survived, recorded that he taught his students a kind of [[teleological]] justification of piety and respect for divine order in nature. This has been described as an [[teleological argument|"intelligent design" argument]] for the existence of God, in which nature has its own ''nous''.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{citation|title=The Religion of Socrates| first=Mark |last= McPherran|year=1996|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nWfQx1CjZl0C&amp;pg=PA274|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press}}, pp. 273-275; and {{citation|title=Creationism and Its Critics in Antiquity|first=David|last=Sedley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgRuJEfzUG8C|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press}}. It has been claimed that his report might be the earliest report of such an argument in {{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GKewlVwJ9rgC&amp;pg=PA27|page=27|title=Socrates: A Guide for the Perplexed| first=Sara |last=Ahbel-Rappe}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in his ''[[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]]'' 1.4.8, he describes Socrates asking a friend sceptical of religion, "Are you, then, of the opinion that intelligence (''nous'') alone exists nowhere and that you by some good chance seized hold of it, while—as you think—those surpassingly large and infinitely numerous things [all the earth and water] are in such orderly condition through some senselessness?" Later in the same discussion he compares the ''nous'', which directs each person's body, to the good sense (''[[phronēsis]]'') of the god, which is in everything, arranging things to its pleasure (1.4.17).&lt;ref&gt;The translation quoted is from Amy Bonnette. {{citation |last=Xenophon|title=Memorabilia|year=1994|publisher=Cornell University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato describes Socrates making the same argument in his ''[[Philebus]]'' 28d, using the same words ''nous'' and ''phronēsis''.&lt;ref&gt;On the [[Perseus Project]]: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhileb.%3Asection%3D28d 28d]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plato===
{{Platonism}}
{{see also|Phaedo|Timaeus (dialogue)}}
[[Plato]] used the word ''nous'' in many ways that were not unusual in the everyday Greek of the time, and often simply meant "good sense" or "awareness".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Kalkavage|chapter=Glossary|title=Plato's Timaeus|year=2001|publisher=Focus Publishing}}. In ancient Greek the word was used for phrases such as "keep in mind" and "to my mind".&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in some of his [[Platonic dialogue]]s it is described by key characters in a higher sense, which was apparently already common. In his ''[[Philebus]]'' 28c he has Socrates say that "all philosophers agree—whereby they really exalt themselves—that mind (''nous'') is king of heaven and earth. Perhaps they are right." and later states that the ensuing discussion "confirms the utterances of those who declared of old that mind (''nous'') always rules the universe".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhileb.%3Apage%3D28 28c] and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhileb.%3Apage%3D30 30d]. Translation by Fowler.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', Plato gives the [[etymology]] of [[Athena]]'s name, the goddess of wisdom, from ''Atheonóa'' (Ἀθεονόα) meaning "god's (''theos'') mind (''nous'')". In his ''[[Phaedo]]'', Plato's teacher Socrates is made to say just before dying that his discovery of Anaxagoras' concept of a cosmic ''nous'' as the cause of the order of things, was an important turning point for him. But he also expressed disagreement with Anaxagoras' understanding of the implications of his own doctrine, because of Anaxagoras' [[materialism|materialist]] understanding of [[Causality|causation]]. Socrates said that Anaxagoras would "give voice and air and hearing and countless other things of the sort as causes for our talking with each other, and should fail to mention the real causes, which are, that the Athenians decided that it was best to condemn me".&lt;ref&gt;Fowler translation of the ''Phaedo'' as on the Perseus webpage: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DPhaedo%3Apage%3D97 97]-[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DPhaedo%3Apage%3D98 98].&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Socrates seems to suggest that he also failed to develop a fully satisfactory [[teleological]] and [[dualism (philosophy)|dualistic]] understanding of a mind of nature, whose aims represent [[the Good]], which all parts of nature aim at.

Concerning the ''nous'' that is the source of understanding of individuals, Plato is widely understood to have used ideas from [[Parmenides]] in addition to Anaxagoras. Like Parmenides, Plato argued that relying on sense perception can never lead to true knowledge, only opinion. Instead, Plato's more philosophical characters argue that ''nous'' must somehow perceive truth directly in the ways gods and [[Daimon#In classical and Hellenistic philosophy|daimons]] perceive. What our mind sees directly in order to really understand things must not be the constantly changing material things, but unchanging entities that exist in a different way, the so-called "[[theory of forms|forms]]" or "[[idea]]s". However he knew that contemporary philosophers often argued (as in modern science) that ''nous'' and perception are just two aspects of one physical activity, and that perception is the source of knowledge and understanding (not the other way around).

Just exactly how Plato believed that the ''nous'' of people lets them come to understand things in any way that improves upon sense perception and the kind of thinking which animals have, is a subject of long running discussion and debate. On the one hand, in the ''Republic'' Plato's Socrates, in the [[Analogy of the sun]] and [[Allegory of the Cave]] describes people as being able to perceive more clearly because of something from outside themselves, something like when the sun shines, helping eyesight. The source of this illumination for the intellect is referred to as the [[Form of the Good]]. On the other hand, in the ''[[Meno]]'' for example, Plato's Socrates explains the theory of ''[[anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]'' whereby people are born with ideas already in their soul, which they somehow remember from [[reincarnation|previous lives]]. Both theories were to become highly influential.

As in Xenophon, Plato's Socrates frequently describes the soul in a political way, with ruling parts, and parts that are by nature meant to be ruled. ''Nous'' is associated with the rational (''logistikon'') part of the individual human soul, which by nature should rule. In his ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', in the so-called "[[analogy of the divided line]]", it has a special function within this rational part. Plato tended to treat ''nous'' as the only immortal part of the [[soul]].

Concerning the cosmos, in the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', the title character also tells a "likely story" in which ''nous'' is responsible for the creative work of the [[demiurge]] or maker who brought rational order to our universe. This craftsman imitated what he perceived in the world of eternal [[substantial form|Forms]]. In the ''[[Philebus]]'' Socrates argues that ''nous'' in individual humans must share in a cosmic ''nous'', in the same way that human bodies are made up of small parts of the elements found in the rest of the universe. And this ''nous'' must be in the ''[[genos]]'' of being a cause of all particular things as particular things.&lt;ref&gt;''Philebus'' on the Perseus Project: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhileb.%3Apage%3D23 23b]-[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhileb.%3Apage%3D30 30e]. Translation is by Fowler.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotle===
{{see also|Dianoia|Active Intellect}}
{{The Works of Aristotle}}
Like Plato, Aristotle saw the ''nous'' or [[intellect]] of an individual as somehow similar to sense perception but also distinct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/#Glo Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Aristotle's Ethics, Glossary of terms].&lt;/ref&gt; Sense perception in [[actuality|action]] provides images to the ''nous'', via the "''[[Common sense#Aristotelian common sense|sensus communis]]''" and imagination, without which thought could not occur. But other animals have ''sensus communis'' and imagination, whereas none of them have ''nous''.&lt;ref&gt;''De Anima'' Book III, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotelians divide perception of forms into the animal-like one which perceives ''species sensibilis'' or ''sensible forms'', and ''species intelligibilis'' that are perceived in a different way by the ''nous''.

Like Plato, Aristotle linked ''nous'' to ''logos'' (reason) as uniquely human, but he also distinguished ''nous'' from ''logos'', thereby distinguishing the faculty for setting definitions from the faculty that uses them to reason with.&lt;ref&gt;"Intelligence (''nous'') apprehend each definition (''horos'' meaning "boundary"), which cannot be proved by reasoning". ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0053:bekker%20page=1142a&amp;highlight=nou%3Ds%2Cnw%3D  1142a], Rackham translation.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', [[Nicomachean ethics#Book VI: Intellectual virtue|Book VI]] Aristotle divides the soul (''psychē'') into two parts, one which has reason and one which does not, but then divides the part which has reason into the reasoning (''logistikos'') part itself which is lower, and the higher "knowing" (''epistēmonikos'') part which contemplates general principles (''archai''). ''Nous'', he states, is the source of the first principles or sources (''archai'') of definitions, and it develops naturally as people gain experience.&lt;ref&gt;This is also discussed by him in the ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' II.19.&lt;/ref&gt; This he explains after first comparing the four other [[truth]] revealing capacities of soul: technical [[know how]] (''[[techne|technē]]''), [[logic]]ally [[Deductive reasoning|deduced]] [[knowledge]] (''[[episteme|epistēmē]]'', sometimes translated as "scientific knowledge"), practical wisdom (''[[phronesis|phronēsis]]''), and lastly [[theory|theoretical]] [[wisdom]] (''[[sophia (wisdom)|sophia]]''), which is defined by Aristotle as the combination of ''nous'' and ''epistēmē''. All of these others apart from ''nous'' are types of reason (''logos'').
{{quote|And intellect [''nous''] is directed at what is ultimate on both sides, since it is intellect and not reason [''logos''] that is directed at both the first terms [''horoi''] and the ultimate particulars, on the one side at the changeless first terms in demonstrations, and on the other side, in thinking about action, at the other sort of premise, the variable particular; for these particulars are the sources [''archai''] from which one discerns that for the sake of which an action is, since the universals are derived from the particulars. Hence intellect is both a beginning and an end, since the demonstrations that are derived from these particulars are also about these. And of these one must have perception, and this perception is intellect.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' [[Nicomachean ethics#Book VI: Intellectual virtue|VI]].xi.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0053:bekker%20page=1143a&amp;highlight=nou%3Ds%2Cnou%3Dn 1143a]-[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0053:bekker%20page=1143b&amp;highlight=nou%3Ds%2Cnou%3Dn 1143b].

[[Aristotle]]'s philosophical works continue many of the same Socratic themes as his teacher Plato. Amongst the new proposals he made was a way of explaining causality, and ''nous'' is an important part of his explanation. As mentioned above, Plato criticized Anaxagoras' materialism, or understanding that the intellect of nature only set the cosmos in motion, but is no longer seen as the cause of physical events. Aristotle explained that the changes of things can be described in terms of [[four causes]] at the same time. Two of these four causes are similar to the materialist understanding: each thing has a material which causes it to be how it is, and some other thing which set in motion or initiated some process of change. But at the same time according to Aristotle each thing is also caused by the natural forms they are tending to become, and the natural ends or aims, which somehow exist in nature as causes, even in cases where human plans and aims are not involved. These latter two causes (the "formal" and "final"), are concepts no longer used in modern science, and encompass the continuous effect of the intelligent ordering principle of nature itself. Aristotle's special description of causality is especially apparent in the natural development of living things. It leads to a method whereby Aristotle analyses causation and motion in terms of the [[Potentiality and actuality|potentialities and actualities]] of all things, whereby all matter possesses various possibilities or potentialities of form and end, and these possibilities become more fully real as their potential forms become actual or active reality (something they will do on their own, by nature, unless stopped because of other natural things happening). For example, a stone has in its nature the potentiality of falling to the earth and it will do so, and actualize this natural tendency, if nothing is in the way.

Aristotle analyzed thinking in the same way. For him, the possibility of understanding rests on the relationship between [[intellect]] and [[sense]] [[perception]]. Aristotle's remarks on the concept of what came to be called the "[[active intellect]]" and "[[passive intellect]]" (along with various other terms) are amongst "the most intensely studied sentences in the history of philosophy".&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{citation |title=Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect|last=Davidson|first=Herbert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms are derived from a single passage in [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] [[On the Soul|''De Anima'']], Book III. Following is the translation of one of those passages&lt;ref&gt;''De Anima'', Bk. III, ch. 5, 430a10-25 translated by Joe Sachs,'' Aristotle's On the Soul and On Memory and Recollection'', Green Lion Books&lt;/ref&gt; with some key Greek words shown in square brackets.
&lt;blockquote&gt;...since in [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] one thing is the material [''[[matter|hulē]]''] for each kind [''[[genos]]''] (this is what is in [[potentiality|potency]] all the particular things of that kind) but it is something else that is the causal and productive thing by which all of them are formed, as is the case with an art in relation to its material, it is necessary in the soul [''[[psyche (psychology)|psychē]]''] too that these distinct aspects be present;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;the one sort is intellect [''nous''] by becoming all things, the other sort by forming all things, in the way an active condition [''[[hexis]]''] like [[light]] too makes the colors that are in potency be at work as colors [''to phōs poiei ta [[dunamis|dunamei]] onta chrōmata [[energeia]]i chrōmata''].&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This sort of intellect [which is like light in the way it makes potential things work as what they are] is separate, as well as being without attributes and unmixed, since it is by its thinghood a [[being-at-work]] [''energeia''], for what acts is always distinguished in stature above what is acted upon, as a governing source is above the material it works on.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Knowledge]] [''epistēmē''], in its being-at-work, is the same as the thing it knows, and while knowledge in potency comes first in time in any one knower, in the whole of things it does not take precedence even in time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This does not mean that at one time it thinks but at another time it does not think, but when separated it is just exactly what it is, and this alone is deathless and everlasting (though we have no memory, because this sort of intellect is not acted upon, while the sort that is acted upon is destructible), and without this nothing thinks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The passage tries to explain "how the human intellect passes from its original state, in which it does not think, to a subsequent state, in which it does" according to his distinction between potentiality and actuality.&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt; Aristotle says that the passive intellect receives the [[intelligible form]]s of things, but that the active intellect is required to make the potential knowledge into actual knowledge, in the same way that light makes potential colours into actual colours. As Davidson remarks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Just what Aristotle meant by potential intellect and active intellect - terms not even explicit in the ''De anima'' and at best implied - and just how he understood the interaction between them remains moot. Students of the history of philosophy continue to debate Aristotle's intent, particularly the question whether he considered the active intellect to be an aspect of the human soul or an entity existing independently of man.&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The passage is often read together with ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Book XII, ch.7-10, where Aristotle makes ''nous'' as an actuality a central subject within a discussion of the cause of being and the cosmos. In that book, Aristotle equates active ''nous'', when people think and their ''nous'' becomes what they think about, with the "[[unmoved mover]]" of the universe, and [[God]]: "For the actuality of thought (''nous'') is life, and God is that actuality; and the essential actuality of God is life most good and eternal."&lt;ref&gt;See ''Metaphysics'' [http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052&amp;layout=&amp;loc=12.1072b 1072b].&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander of Aphrodisias, for example, equated this active intellect which is God with the one explained in ''De Anima'', while Themistius thought they could not be simply equated. (See below.)

Like Plato before him, Aristotle believes Anaxagoras' cosmic ''nous'' implies and requires the cosmos to have intentions or ends: "Anaxagoras makes the Good a principle as causing motion; for Mind (''nous'') moves things, but moves them for some end, and therefore there must be some other Good—unless it is as we say; for on our view the art of medicine is in a sense health."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D12%3Asection%3D1075b 1075]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the philosophy of Aristotle the soul ([[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]) of a body is what makes it alive, and is its actualized form; thus, every living thing, including plant life, has a soul. The mind or intellect (''nous'') can be described variously as a power, faculty, part, or aspect of the human soul. It should be noted that for Aristotle soul and ''nous'' are not the same. He did not rule out the possibility that ''nous'' might survive without the rest of the soul, as in Plato, but he specifically says that this immortal ''nous'' does not include any memories or anything else specific to an individual's life. In his ''[[Generation of Animals]]'' Aristotle specifically says that while other parts of the soul come from the parents, physically, the human ''nous'', must come from outside, into the body, because it is divine or godly, and it has nothing in common with the ''energeia'' of the body.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Generation of Animals]]'' II.iii.736b.&lt;/ref&gt; This was yet another passage which Alexander of Aphrodisias would link to those mentioned above from ''De Anima'' and the ''Metaphysics'' in order to understand Aristotle's intentions.

===Post Aristotelian classical theories===
Until the early modern era, much of the discussion which has survived today concerning ''nous'' or intellect, in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, concerned how to correctly interpret Aristotle and Plato. However, at least during the classical period, materialist philosophies, more similar to modern science, such as [[Epicureanism]], were still relatively common also. The Epicureans believed that the bodily senses themselves were not the cause of error, but the interpretations can be. The term ''[[Proslepsis|prolepsis]]'' was used by Epicureans to describe the way the mind forms general concepts from sense perceptions.

To the [[Stoics]], more like Heraclitus than Anaxagoras, order in the cosmos comes from an entity called [[logos]], the [[Cosmos|cosmic]] [[reason]]. But as in Anaxagoras this cosmic reason, like human reason but higher, is connected to the reason of individual humans. The Stoics however, did not invoke incorporeal causation, but attempted to explain physics and human thinking in terms of matter and forces. As in Aristotelianism, they explained the interpretation of sense data requiring the mind to be stamped or formed with ideas, and that people have shared conceptions that help them make sense of things (''[[koine ennoia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Prolepsis and Ennoia in the Early Stoa|first= Henry |last=Dyson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1AXMNpIgJ4C| year=2009| publisher=Walter de Gruyter}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nous'' for them is soul "somehow disposed" (''pôs echon''), the soul being somehow disposed ''[[pneuma]]'', which is fire or air or a mixture. As in Plato, they treated ''nous'' as the ruling part of the soul.&lt;ref name=Menn/&gt;

[[Plutarch]] criticized the Stoic idea of ''nous'' being corporeal, and agreed with Plato that the soul is more divine than the body while ''nous'' (mind) is more divine than the soul.&lt;ref name=Menn/&gt; The mix of soul and body produces [[pleasure]] and [[pain]]; the conjunction of mind and soul produces [[reason]] which is the cause or the source of [[virtue]] and [[vice]]. (From: “On the Face in the Moon”) &lt;ref&gt;[[Lacus Curtius]] online text: On the Face in the Moon [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/The_Face_in_the_Moon*/D.html#28 par. 28]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albinus (philosopher)|Albinus]] was one of the earliest authors to equate Aristotle's ''nous'' as [[primum movens|prime mover]] of the Universe, with Plato's [[Form of the Good]].&lt;ref name=Menn/&gt;

====Alexander of Aphrodisias====
{{Main article|Alexander of Aphrodisias}}
[[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] was a [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] (Aristotelian) and his ''On the Soul'' (referred to as ''De anima'' in its traditional Latin title), explained that by his interpretation of Aristotle, potential intellect in man, that which has no nature but receives one from the active intellect, is material, and also called the "material intellect" (''nous hulikos'') and it is inseparable from the body, being "only a disposition" of it.&lt;ref&gt;''De anima'' 84, cited in Davidson, page 9, who translated the quoted words.&lt;/ref&gt;  He argued strongly against the doctrine of immortality.&lt;ref name=EB-alex&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Alexander of Aphrodisias |volume=1 |page=556}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, he identified the active intellect (''nous poietikos''), through whose agency the potential intellect in man becomes actual, not with anything from within people, but with the divine creator itself.&lt;ref name=EB-alex/&gt; In the early Renaissance his doctrine of the soul's mortality was adopted by [[Pietro Pomponazzi]] against the [[Thomists]] and the [[Averroists]].&lt;ref name=EB-alex/&gt; For him, the only possible human immortality is an immortality of a detached human thought, more specifically when the ''nous'' has as the object of its thought the active intellect itself, or another incorporeal intelligible form.&lt;ref name="Davidson p.43"&gt;Davidson p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander was also responsible for influencing the development of several more technical terms concerning the intellect, which became very influential amongst the great Islamic philosophers, [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]].
*The intellect ''in habitu'' is a stage in which the human intellect has taken possession of a repertoire of thoughts, and so is potentially able to think those thoughts, but is not yet thinking these thoughts.
*The intellect from outside, which became the "acquired intellect" in Islamic philosophy, describes the incorporeal active intellect which comes from outside man, and becomes an object of thought, making the material intellect actual and active. This term may have come from a particularly expressive translation of Alexander into Arabic. Plotinus also used such a term.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, in Al-Farabi and Avicenna, the term took on a new meaning, distinguishing it from the active intellect in any simple sense - an ultimate stage of the human intellect where a kind of close relationship (a "conjunction") is made between a person's active intellect and the transcendental ''nous'' itself.

====Themistius====
{{Main article|Themistius}}
[[Themistius]], another influential commentator on this matter, understood Aristotle differently, stating that the passive or material intellect does "not employ a bodily organ for its activity, is wholly unmixed with the body, impassive, and separate [from matter]".&lt;ref&gt;Translation and citation by Davidson again, from Themistius' paraphrase of Aristotle's ''[[De Anima]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; This means the human potential intellect, and not only the active intellect, is an incorporeal substance, or a disposition of incorporeal substance. For Themistius, the human soul becomes immortal "as soon as the active intellect intertwines with it at the outset of human thought".&lt;ref name="Davidson p.43"/&gt;

This understanding of the intellect was also very influential for [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]], and "virtually all Islamic and Jewish philosophers".&lt;ref&gt;Davidson page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, concerning the active intellect, like Alexander and Plotinus, he saw this as a transcendent being existing above and outside man. Differently from Alexander, he did not equate this being with the first cause of the Universe itself, but something lower.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; However he equated it with Plato's [[Idea of the Good]].&lt;ref&gt;Davidson p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plotinus and neoplatonism==
{{Main article|Plotinus|Neoplatonism|Porphyry (philosopher)|Proclus}}
Of the later Greek and Roman writers [[Plotinus]], the initiator of [[neoplatonism]], is particularly significant. Like Alexander of Aphrodisias and Themistius, he saw himself as a commentator explaining the doctrines of Plato and Aristotle. But in his ''[[Enneads]]'' he went further than those authors, often working from passages which had been presented more tentatively, possibly inspired partly by earlier authors such as the [[neopythagorean]] [[Numenius of Apamea]]. Neoplatonism provided a major inspiration to discussion concerning the intellect in late classical and medieval philosophy, theology and cosmology.

In neoplatonism there exists several levels or ''[[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostases]]'' of being, including the natural and visible world as a lower part.
*The [[Monism|Monad]] or "the One" sometimes also described as "[[the Good]]", based on the concept as it is found in Plato. This is the ''[[dunamis]]'' or possibility of existence. It causes the other levels by [[emanation]].
*The ''Nous'' (usually translated as "Intellect", or "Intelligence" in this context, or sometimes "mind" or "reason") is described as God, or more precisely an image of God, often referred to as the ''[[Demiurge]]''. It thinks its own contents, which are thoughts, equated to the Platonic ideas or [[Theory of Forms|forms]] (''eide''). The thinking of this Intellect is the highest ''activity'' of life. The ''actualization'' (''[[energeia]]'') of this thinking is the being of the forms. This Intellect is the first principle or foundation of existence. The One is prior to it, but not in the sense that a normal cause is prior to an effect, but instead Intellect is called an [[emanation]] of the One. The One is the possibility of this foundation of existence.
*[[Soul]] (''psychē''). The soul is also an ''energeia'': it acts upon or ''actualizes'' its own thoughts and creates "a separate, material cosmos that is the living image of the spiritual or noetic [[Cosmos]] contained as a unified thought within the Intelligence". So it is the soul which perceives things in nature physically, which it understands to be reality. Soul in Plotinus plays a role similar to the potential intellect in Aristotelian terminology.&lt;ref name=Menn/&gt;
*Lowest is matter.
This was based largely upon Plotinus' reading of Plato, but also incorporated many Aristotelian concepts, including the [[Unmoved Mover]] as ''energeia''.&lt;ref&gt;See {{citation |chapter=Plotinus|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/plotinus/|last=Moore|first=Edward}} and {{citation |chapter=Plotinus|title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plotinus/|last=Gerson|first=Lloyd}}. The direct quote above comes from Moore.&lt;/ref&gt; They also incorporated a theory of ''anamnesis'', or knowledge coming from the past lives of our immortal souls, like that found in some of Plato's dialogues.

Later [[Platonists]] distinguished a hierarchy of three separate manifestations of ''nous'', like Numenius of Apamea had.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of The Study in Philosophy'' (1969), Vol. 5, article on subject "Nous", article author: G.B. Kerferd&lt;/ref&gt; Notable later neoplatonists include [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and [[Proclus]].

==Medieval ''nous'' in religion==&lt;!--Linked from 'Noetics'--&gt;
Greek philosophy had an influence on the major religions that defined the [[Middle Ages]], and one aspect of this was the concept of ''nous''.

===Gnosticism===
{{Gnosticism}}
{{Main article|Gnosticism|Neoplatonism and Gnosticism}}
Gnosticism was a [[late antiquity|late classical]] movement that incorporated ideas inspired by neoplatonism and neopythagoreanism, but which was more a [[syncretism|syncretic]] religious movement than an accepted philosophical movement.

====Valentinus====
{{Main article|Valentinus (Gnostic)}}
In [[Valentinianism]], Nous is the first male [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|Aeon]]. Together with his conjugate female Aeon, Aletheia (truth), he emanates from the [[Monad (Gnosticism)|Propator Bythos]] ({{lang|grc|Προπάτωρ Βυθος}} "Forefather Depths") and his co-eternal Ennoia ({{lang|grc|[[:wikt: ἔννοια|Ἔννοια]]}} "Thought") or Sigē ({{lang|grc|[[:wikt:σιγή|Σιγή]]}} "Silence"); and these four form the primordial [[Tetractys|Tetrad]]. Like the other male Aeons he is sometimes regarded as [[androgyny|androgynous]], including in himself the female Aeon who is paired with him. He is the Only Begotten; and is styled the Father, the Beginning of All, inasmuch as from him are derived immediately or mediately the remaining Aeons who complete the [[Ogdoad (Gnosticism)|Ogdoad]] (eight), thence the Decad (ten), and thence the Dodecad (twelve); in all, thirty Aeons constitute the [[Pleroma]].

He alone is capable of knowing the Propator; but when he desired to impart like knowledge to the other Aeons, was withheld from so doing by Sigē. When [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]] ("Wisdom"), youngest Aeon of the thirty, was brought into peril by her yearning after this knowledge, Nous was foremost of the Aeons in interceding for her. From him, or through him from the Propator, [[Valentinianism#Horos|Horos]] was sent to restore her. After her restoration, Nous, according to the providence of the Propator, produced another pair, [[Christ]] and the [[Holy Spirit]], "in order to give fixity and steadfastness ({{lang|grc|εις πήξιν και στηριγμόν}}) to the Pleroma." For this Christ teaches the Aeons to be content to know that the Propator is in himself incomprehensible, and can be perceived only through the Only Begotten (Nous).&lt;ref&gt;[[Irenaeus]], ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis]]'', I. i. 1-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hippolytus of Rome]], ''[[Refutation of All Heresies]]'', vi. 29-31; [[Theodoret]], ''Haer. Fab.'' i. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Basilides====
{{Main article|Basilides}}
A similar conception of Nous appears in the later teaching of the [[Basilideans]], according to which he is the first begotten of the Unbegotten Father, and himself the parent of ''[[Logos]]'', from whom emanate successively ''[[Phronesis]]'', ''Sophia'', and ''[[potentiality and actuality|Dunamis]]''. But in this teaching, Nous is identified with Christ, is named [[Jesus]], is sent to save those that believe, and returns to Him who sent him, after a [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] which is apparent only, [[Simon of Cyrene]] being substituted for him on the cross.&lt;ref&gt;Iren. I. xxiv. 4; Theod. ''H. E.'' i. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It is probable, however, that Nous had a place in the original system of Basilides himself; for his ''Ogdoad'', "the great [[Archon]] of the universe, the ineffable"&lt;ref&gt;Hipp. vi. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; is apparently made up of the five members named by [[Irenaeus]] (as above), together with two whom we find in [[Clement of Alexandria]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement of Alexandria]], ''[[Stromata|Strom]].'' iv. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dikaiosyne'' and ''Eirene'', added to the originating Father.

====Simon Magus====
{{Main article|Simon Magus}}
The antecedent of these systems is that of Simon,&lt;ref&gt;Hipp. vi. 12 ff.; Theod. I. i.&lt;/ref&gt; of whose six "roots" emanating from the Unbegotten Fire, ''Nous'' is first. The correspondence of these "roots" with the first six ''Aeons'' that Valentinus derives from ''Bythos'', is noted by [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]].&lt;ref&gt;Hipp. vi. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Simon says in his ''[[Simonians#The Great Declaration|Apophasis Megalē]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Ap. Hipp. vi. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|There are two offshoots of the entire ages, having neither beginning nor end.... Of these the one appears from above, the great power, the ''Nous'' of the universe, administering all things, male; the other from beneath, the great ''Epinoia'', female, bringing forth all things.}}
To Nous and ''Epinoia'' correspond Heaven and Earth, in the list given by Simon of the six material counterparts of his six emanations. The identity of this list with the six material objects alleged by [[Herodotus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], i.&lt;/ref&gt; to be worshipped by the [[Persian people|Persians]], together with the supreme place given by Simon to Fire as the primordial power, leads us to look to [[history of Iran|Iran]] for the origin of these systems in one aspect. In another, they connect themselves with the teaching of [[Pythagoras]] and of Plato.

====''Gospel of Mary''====
{{Main article|Gospel of Mary}}
According to the ''Gospel of Mary'', Jesus himself articulates the essence of ''Nous'':
{{quote|"There where is the ''nous'', lies the treasure." Then I said to him: "Lord, when someone meets you in a Moment of Vision, is it through the soul [''psychē''] that they see, or is it through the spirit [''pneuma'']?" The Teacher answered: "It is neither through the soul nor the spirit, but the ''nous'' between the two which sees the vision..."|''The Gospel of Mary'', p. 10}}

===Medieval Islamic philosophy===
{{Main article|Islamic philosophy|Jewish philosophy|Averroism}}
During the [[Middle Ages]], philosophy itself was in many places seen as opposed to the prevailing monotheistic religions, [[Islam]], [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]]. The strongest philosophical tradition for some centuries was amongst Islamic philosophers, who later came to strongly influence the late medieval philosophers of western Christendom, and the [[Jewish diaspora]] in the Mediterranean area. While there were earlier Muslim philosophers such as [[Al Kindi]], chronologically the three most influential concerning the intellect were [[Al Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and finally [[Averroes]], a westerner who lived in Spain and was highly influential in the late Middle Ages amongst Jewish and Christian philosophers.

====Al Farabi====
{{Main article|Al Farabi}}
The exact precedents of Al Farabi's influential philosophical scheme, in which ''nous'' (Arabic ''[['aql|ʿaql]]'') plays an important role, are no longer perfectly clear because of the great loss of texts in the Middle Ages which he would have had access to. He was apparently innovative in at least some points. He was clearly influenced by the same late classical world as neoplatonism, neopythagoreanism, but exactly how is less clear. Plotinus, Themistius and Alexander of Aphrodisias are generally accepted to have been influences. However while these three all placed the active intellect "at or near the top of the hierarchy of being", Al Farabi was clear in making it the lowest ranking in a series of distinct transcendental intelligences. He is the first known person to have done this in a clear way.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson pp.12-14. One possible inspiration mentioned in a commentary of Aristotle's ''[[De Anima]]'' attributed to [[John Philoponus]] is a philosopher named Marinus, who was probably a student of [[Proclus]]. He in any case designated the active intellect to be angelic or daimonic, rather than the creator itself.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the first philosopher known to have assumed the existence of a causal hierarchy of [[celestial spheres]], and the incorporeal intelligences parallel to those spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson p.18 and p.45, which states "Within the translunar region, Aristotle recognized no causal relationship in what we may call the vertical plane; he did not recognize a causality that runs down through the series of incorporeal movers. And in the horizontal plane, that is, from each intelligence to the corresponding sphere, he recognized causality only in respect to motion, not in respect to existence."&lt;/ref&gt; Al Farabi also fitted an explanation of prophecy into this scheme, in two levels. According to Davidson (p.&amp;nbsp;59):&lt;blockquote&gt;The lower of the two levels, labeled specifically as "[[prophecy]]" (''nubuwwa''), is enjoyed by men who have not yet perfected their intellect, whereas the higher, which Alfarabi sometimes specifically names "[[revelation]]" (''w-ḥ-y''), comes exclusively to those who stand at the stage of acquired intellect.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This happens in the [[imagination]] (Arabic ''mutakhayyila''; Greek ''phantasia''), a faculty of the mind already described by Aristotle, which al Farabi described as serving the rational part of the soul (Arabic ''ʿaql''; Greek ''nous''). This faculty of imagination stores sense perceptions (''maḥsūsāt''), disassembles or recombines them, creates figurative or symbolic images (''muḥākāt'') of them which then appear in dreams, visualizes present and predicted events in a way different from conscious deliberation (''rawiyya''). This is under the influence, according to Al Farabi, of the active intellect. Theoretical truth can only be received by this faculty in a figurative or symbolic form, because the imagination is a physical capability and can not receive theoretical information in a proper abstract form. This rarely comes in a waking state, but more often in dreams. The lower type of prophecy is the best possible for the imaginative faculty, but the higher type of prophecy requires not only a receptive imagination, but also the condition of an "acquired intellect", where the human ''nous'' is in "conjunction" with the active intellect in the sense of God. Such a prophet is also a philosopher. When a philosopher-prophet has the necessary leadership qualities, he becomes philosopher-king.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson pp.58-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Avicenna====
{{Main article|Avicenna}}
In terms of cosmology, according to Davidson (p.&amp;nbsp;82) "Avicenna's universe has a structure virtually identical with the structure of Alfarabi's" but there are differences in details. As in Al Farabi, there are several levels of intellect, intelligence or ''nous'', each of the higher ones being associated with a celestial sphere. Avicenna however details three different types of effect which each of these higher intellects has, each "thinks" both the necessary existence and the possible being of the intelligence one level higher. And each "emanates" downwards the body and soul of its own celestial sphere, and also the intellect at the next lowest level. The active intellect, as in Alfarabi, is the last in the chain. Avicenna sees active intellect as the cause not only of intelligible thought and the forms in the "sublunar" world we people live, but also the matter. (In other words, three effects.)&lt;ref name=Davidson4&gt;Davidson ch. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the workings of the human soul, Avicenna, like Al Farabi, sees the "material intellect" or potential intellect as something that is not material. He believed the soul was incorporeal, and the potential intellect was a disposition of it which was in the soul from birth. As in Al Farabi there are two further stages of potential for thinking, which are not yet actual thinking, first the mind acquires the most basic intelligible thoughts which we can not think in any other way, such as "the whole is greater than the part", then comes a second level of derivative intelligible thoughts which could be thought.&lt;ref name=Davidson4/&gt; Concerning the actualization of thought, Avicenna applies the term "to two different things, to actual human thought, irrespective of the intellectual progress a man has made, and to actual thought when human intellectual development is complete", as in Al Farabi.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

When reasoning in the sense of deriving conclusions from [[syllogisms]], Avicenna says people are using a physical "cogitative" faculty (''mufakkira, fikra'') of the soul, which can err. The human cogitative faculty is the same as the "compositive imaginative faculty (''mutakhayyila'') in reference to the animal soul".&lt;ref&gt;From ''Shifā': De Anima'' 45, translation by Davidson p.96.&lt;/ref&gt; But some people can use "insight" to avoid this step and derive conclusions directly by conjoining with the active intellect.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson pp.102&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a thought has been learned in a soul, the physical faculties of sense perception and imagination become unnecessary, and as a person acquires more thoughts, their soul becomes less connected to their body.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson p.104&lt;/ref&gt; For Avicenna, different from the normal Aristotelian position, all of the soul is by nature immortal. But the level of intellectual development does affect the type of afterlife that the soul can have. Only a soul which has reached the highest type of conjunction with the active intellect can form a perfect conjunction with it after the death of the body, and this is a supreme ''[[eudaimonia]]''. Lesser intellectual achievement means a less happy or even painful afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson pp.111-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning prophecy, Avicenna identifies a broader range of possibilities which fit into this model, which is still similar to that of Al Farabi.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson p.123.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Averroes====
{{Main article|Averroes|Averroism}}
Averroes came to be regarded even in Europe as "the Commentator" to "the Philosopher", Aristotle, and his study of the questions surrounding the ''nous'' were very influential amongst Jewish and Christian philosophers, with some aspects being quite controversial. According to Herbert Davidson, Averroes' doctrine concerning ''nous'' can be divided into two periods. In the first, neoplatonic emanationism, not found in the original works of Aristotle, was combined with a naturalistic explanation of the human material intellect. "It also insists on the material intellect's having an active intellect as a direct object of thought and conjoining with the active intellect, notions never expressed in the Aristotelian canon." It was this presentation which Jewish philosophers such as [[Moses Narboni]] and [[Gersonides]] understood to be Averroes'. In the later model of the universe, which was transmitted to Christian philosophers, Averroes "dismisses emanationism and explains the generation of living beings in the sublunar world naturalistically, all in the name of a more genuine Aristotelianism. Yet it abandons the earlier naturalistic conception of the human material intellect and transforms the material intellect into something wholly un-Aristotelian, a single transcendent entity serving all mankind. It nominally salvages human conjunction with the active intellect, but in words that have little content."&lt;ref&gt;Davidson p.356&lt;/ref&gt;

This position, that humankind shares one active intellect, was taken up by Parisian philosophers such as [[Siger of Brabant]], but also widely rejected by philosophers such as [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Ramon Lull]], and [[Duns Scotus]]. Despite being widely considered heretical, the position was later defended by many more European philosophers including [[John of Jandun]], who was the primary link bringing this doctrine from Paris to Bologna. After him this position continued to be defended and also rejected by various writers in northern Italy. In the 16th century it finally became a less common position after the renewal of an "Alexandrian" position based on that of Alexander of Aphrodisias, associated with [[Pietro Pomponazzi]].&lt;ref&gt;Davidson ch.7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
The Christian [[New Testament]] makes mention of the ''nous'' or ''noos'', generally translated in modern English as "mind", but also showing a link to God's will or law:
*{{bibleverse||Romans|7:23|KJV}}, refers to the law (''nomos'') of God which is the law in the writer's ''nous'', as opposed to the law of sin which is in the body. 
*{{bibleverse||Romans|12:2|KJV}}, demands Christians should not conform to this world, but continuously be transformed by the renewing of their ''nous'', so as to be able to determine what God’s will is.
*{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|14:14|KJV}}-{{bibleverse-nb|1|Corinthians|14:19|KJV}}. Discusses "[[speaking in tongues]]" and says that a person who speaks in tongues that they can not understand should prefer to also have understanding (''nous''), and it is better for the listeners also to be able to understand. 
*{{bibleverse||Ephesians|4:17|KJV}}-{{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|4:23|KJV}}. Discusses how non-Christians have a worthless ''nous'', while Christians should seek to renew the spirit (''pneuma'') of their ''nous''.
*{{bibleverse|2|Thessalonians|2:2|KJV}}. Uses the term to refer to being troubled of mind.
*{{bibleverse||Revelation|17:9|KJV}}: "here is the ''nous'' which has wisdom".

In the writings of the [[Church Fathers|Christian fathers]] a sound or pure ''nous'' is considered essential to the cultivation of [[wisdom]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the many references to ''nous'' and the necessity of its purification in the writings of the [[Philokalia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philosophers influencing western Christianity====
While philosophical works were not commonly read or taught in the early Middle Ages in most of Europe, the works of authors like [[Boethius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] formed an important exception. Both were influenced by neoplatonism, and were amongst the older works that were still known in the time of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], and the beginnings of [[Scholasticism]].

In his early years Augustine was heavily influenced by [[Manichaeism]] and afterwards by the [[Neo-Platonism]] of [[Plotinus]].&lt;ref name="Oxford:Platonism"&gt;{{cite book | editor= Cross, Frank L. |editor2=Livingstone, Elizabeth |chapter=Platonism| title = The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford Oxfordshire | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-19-280290-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his conversion to Christianity and baptism (387), he developed his own approach to philosophy and theology, accommodating a variety of methods and different perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Augustine the Theologian|last= TeSelle |first= Eugene |year= 1970 | location= London |pages= 347–349 | isbn= 0-223-97728-4}} March 2002 edition: {{ISBN|1-57910-918-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine]] used [[neoplatonism]] selectively. He used both the neoplatonic ''Nous'', and the Platonic [[Form of the Good]] (or ''"The Idea of the Good"'') as equivalent terms for the Christian God, or at least for one particular aspect of God. For example, God, ''nous'', can act directly upon matter, and not only through souls, and concerning the souls through which it works upon the world experienced by humanity, some are treated as [[angels]].&lt;ref name=Menn&gt;{{citation |title=Descartes and Augustine|last=Menn|first=Stephen|publisher=University of Cambridge Press|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholasticism becomes more clearly defined much later, as the peculiar native type of philosophy in medieval catholic Europe. In this period, Aristotle became "the Philosopher", and scholastic philosophers, like their Jewish and Muslim contemporaries, studied the concept of the ''intellectus'' on the basis not only of Aristotle, but also late classical interpreters like Augustine and Boethius. A European tradition of new and direct interpretations of Aristotle developed which was eventually strong enough to argue with partial success against some of the interpretations of Aristotle from the Islamic world, most notably Averroes' doctrine of their being one "active intellect" for all humanity. Notable "[[Catholic]]" (as opposed to Averroist) Aristotelians included [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]], the founder [[Thomism]], which exists to this day in various forms. Concerning the ''nous'', Thomism agrees with those Aristotelians who insist that the intellect is immaterial and separate from any bodily organs, but as per Christian doctrine, the whole of the human soul is immortal, not only the intellect.

====Eastern Orthodox====
The human ''nous'' in [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] is the "eye of the heart or soul" or the "mind of the heart".&lt;ref name="Neptic Monasticism"&gt;[http://www.greekorthodoxchurch.org/neptic_monasticism.html Neptic Monasticism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/phronema/patristic-theology-romanides-chapter-1-what-is-the-human-nous.aspx "What is the Human Nous?"] by [[John Romanides]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Before embarking on this study, the reader is asked to absorb a few Greek terms for which there is no English word that would not be imprecise or misleading. Chief among these is NOUS, which refers to the `eye of the heart' and is often translated as mind or intellect. Here we keep the Greek word NOUS throughout. The adjective related to it is NOETIC (noeros)." [http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b02.en.orthodox_psychotherapy.06.htm#2k Orthodox Psychotherapy Section The Knowledge of God according to St. Gregory Palamas] by Metropolitan [[Hierotheos (Vlachos)|Hierotheos Vlachos]] published by Birth of Theotokos Monastery, Greece (January 1, 2005) {{ISBN|978-960-7070-27-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, SVS Press, 1997.

[[Saint]] [[Thalassius of Syria]] wrote that God created  beings "with a capacity to receive the Spirit and to attain knowledge of Himself; He has brought into existence the senses and sensory perception to serve such beings". Eastern Orthodox Christians hold that God did this by creating mankind with intelligence and [[:wikt:noetic|noetic]] faculties.&lt;ref&gt;G.E.H; Sherrard, Philip; Ware, Kallistos (Timothy). The [[Philokalia]], Vol. 4 Pg432
Nous the highest facility in man, through which - provided it is purified - he knows God or the [[logos|inner essences]] or principles (q.v.) of created things by means of [[noesis|direct apprehension]] or spiritual perception. Unlike the dianoia or reason (q.v.), from which it must be carefully distinguished, the intellect does not function by formulating abstract concepts and then arguing on this basis to a conclusion reached through deductive reasoning, but it understands divine truth by means of immediate experience, intuition or 'simple cognition' (the term used by St Isaac the Syrian). The intellect dwells in the 'depths of the soul'; it constitutes the innermost aspect of the heart (St Diadochos, 79, 88: in our translation, vol. i, pp.. 280, 287). The intellect is the organ of contemplation (q.v.), the 'eye of the heart' (Makarian Homilies).&lt;/ref&gt;

Human reasoning is not enough: there will always remain an "irrational residue" which escapes analysis and which can not be expressed in concepts: it is this unknowable depth of things, that which constitutes their true, indefinable essence that also reflects the origin of things in God. In Eastern Christianity it is by faith or intuitive truth that this component of an objects existence is grasped.&lt;ref name=lossky&gt;The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, by Vladimir Lossky SVS Press, 1997, pg 33 ({{ISBN|0-913836-31-1}}).

AN ORTHODOX PERSPECTIVE by Sergey S. Horujy [synergia-isa.ru/english/download/lib/Eng12-ChicLect.doc] [http://www.hn.psu.edu/Academics/past_lectures.html#Sergei_Horujy_Literary_Scholar]&lt;/ref&gt; Faith (''pistis'') is therefore sometimes used interchangeably with ''noesis'' in [[Eastern Christianity]].

Angels have intelligence and ''nous'', whereas men have [[reason]], both ''logos'' and ''[[dianoia]]'', ''nous'' and [[sensory perception]]. This follows the idea that man is a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] and an expression of the whole creation or [[macrocosmos]]. The human ''nous'' was darkened after the [[Fall of Man]] (which was the result of the rebellion of reason against the ''nous''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b05.en.the_illness_and_cure_of_the_soul.02.htm#Fall "THE ILLNESS AND CURE OF THE SOUL"] Metropolitan Hierotheos of Nafpaktos&lt;/ref&gt; but after the purification (healing or correction) of the ''nous'' (achieved through ascetic practices like [[hesychasm]]), the human ''nous'' (the "eye of the heart") will [[theoria|see God's uncreated Light]] (and feel God's uncreated love and beauty, at which point the nous will start the unceasing [[prayer of the heart]]) and become illuminated, allowing the person to become an orthodox theologian.&lt;ref name="Neptic Monasticism"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acrod.org/sn/sn4a.shtml The Relationship between Prayer and Theology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011114120/http://www.acrod.org/sn/sn4a.shtml |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://romanity.org/htm/rom.19.en.jesus_christ_the_life_of_the_world.01.htm "JESUS CHRIST - THE LIFE OF THE WORLD", John S. Romanides]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this belief, the soul is created in the image of God. Since God is [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]], Mankind is ''Nous'', [[reason]], both ''logos'' and ''dianoia'', and Spirit. The same is held true of the soul (or heart): it has ''nous'', word and spirit. To understand this better first an understanding of Saint [[Gregory Palamas]]'s teaching that man is a representation of the trinitarian mystery should be addressed. This holds that God is not meant in the sense that the [[Trinity]] should be understood [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphically]], but man is to be understood in a triune way.  Or, that the Trinitarian God is not to be interpreted from the point of view of individual man, but man is interpreted on the basis of the Trinitarian God. And this interpretation is revelatory not merely psychological and human. This means that it is only when a person is within the revelation, as all the saints lived, that he can grasp this understanding completely (see ''[[theoria]]''). The second presupposition is that mankind has and is composed of ''nous'', word and spirit like the trinitarian mode of being. Man's ''nous'', word and spirit are not [[hypostases]] or individual existences or realities, but activities or energies of the soul - whereas in the case with God or the Persons of the [[Holy Trinity]], each are indeed hypostases. So these three components of each individual man are 'inseparable from one another' but they do not have a personal character" when in speaking of the being or [[ontology]] that is mankind. The ''nous'' as the eye of the soul, which some Fathers also call the heart, is the centre of man and is where true (spiritual) knowledge is validated. This is seen as true knowledge which is "implanted in the ''nous'' as always co-existing with it".&lt;ref&gt;Metropolitan [[Hierotheos Vlachos]] (2005), [http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b02.en.orthodox_psychotherapy.03.htm#in1 ''Orthodox Psychotherapy''], Tr.

==Early modern philosophy==
The so-called [[early modern philosophy|"early modern" philosophers]] of western Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries established arguments which led to the establishment of [[modern science]] as a methodical approach to improve the welfare of [[human]]ity by learning to control nature. As such, speculation about [[metaphysics]], which cannot be used for anything practical, and which can never be confirmed against the reality we experience, started to be deliberately avoided, especially according to the so-called "[[empiricist]]" arguments of philosophers such as [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[Hobbes]], [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[David Hume|Hume]]. The Latin motto "''nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu''" (nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses) has been described as the "guiding principle of empiricism" in the ''Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy''.&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100234623|title=nihil in intellectu nisi prius in sensu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This was in fact an old Aristotelian doctrine, which they took up, but as discussed above Aristotelians still believed that the senses on their own were not enough to explain the mind.)

These philosophers explain the intellect as something developed from experience of sensations, being interpreted by the brain in a physical way, and nothing else, which means that [[absolute knowledge]] is impossible. For Bacon, Hobbes and Locke, who wrote in both English and Latin, "''intellectus''" was translated as "understanding".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Martinich|page=305|title=A Hobbes Dictionary|first=Aloysius|publisher=Blackwell|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Far from seeing it as secure way to perceive the truth about reality, Bacon, for example, actually named the ''intellectus'' in his ''[[Novum Organum]]'', and the [[wikt:proœmium|proœmium]] to his ''[[Great Instauration]]'', as a major source of wrong conclusions, because it is biased in many ways, for example towards over-generalizing. For this reason, modern science should be methodical, in order not to be misled by the weak human intellect. He felt that lesser known Greek philosophers such as [[Democritus]] "who did not suppose a mind or reason in the frame of things", have been arrogantly dismissed because of Aristotelianism leading to a situation in his time wherein "the search of the physical causes hath been neglected, and passed in silence".&lt;ref&gt;Bacon ''[[Advancement of Learning]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/advancementlea00bacouoft#page/90/mode/2up/search/democritus II.VII.7]&lt;/ref&gt; The intellect or understanding was the subject of Locke's ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Nidditch|first=Peter|chapter=Foreword|page=xxii|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These philosophers also tended not to emphasize the distinction between reason and intellect, describing the peculiar universal or abstract definitions of human understanding as being man-made and resulting from reason itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Thomas|last=Hobbes|title=The English Works of Thomas Hobbes|volume=3 (Leviathan) |chapter=II. Of Imagination|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=585&amp;chapter=89820&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27}} and also see ''[[De Homine]]'' X.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume even questioned the distinctness or peculiarity of human understanding and reason, compared to other types of associative or imaginative thinking found in some other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=David |last=Hume|chapter=I.III.VII (footnote) Of the Nature of the Idea Or Belief|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=342&amp;chapter=55095&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27#lf0213_footnote_nt018|title=A Treatise of Human Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern science during this time, [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] is sometimes described as more empiricist compared to Leibniz.

On the other hand, into modern times some philosophers have continued to propose that the human mind has an in-born ("''a priori''") ability to know the truth conclusively, and these philosophers have needed to argue that the human mind has direct and intuitive ideas about nature, and this means it can not be limited entirely to what can be known from sense perception. Amongst the early modern philosophers, some such as [[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], tend to be distinguished from the empiricists as [[rationalists]], and to some extent at least some of them are called [[idealists]], and their writings on the intellect or understanding present various doubts about empiricism, and in some cases they argued for positions which appear more similar to those of medieval and classical philosophers.

The first in this series of modern rationalists, Descartes, is credited with defining a "[[mind-body problem]]" which is a major subject of discussion for university philosophy courses. According to the presentation his [[Meditations on First Philosophy#Meditation II: Concerning the Nature of the Human Mind: That It Is Better Known Than the Body|2nd ''Meditation'']], the human mind and body are different in kind, and while Descartes agrees with Hobbes for example that the human body works like a clockwork mechanism, and its workings include memory and imagination, the real human is the thinking being, a soul, which is not part of that mechanism. Descartes explicitly refused to divide this soul into its traditional parts such as intellect and reason, saying that these things were indivisible aspects of the soul. Descartes was therefore a [[Mind-body dualism|dualist]], but very much in opposition to traditional Aristotelian dualism. In his [[Meditations on First Philosophy#Meditation VI: Concerning the Existence of Material Things, and the Real Distinction between Mind and Body|6th ''Meditation'']] he deliberately uses traditional terms and states that his active faculty of giving ideas to his thought must be corporeal, because the things perceived are clearly external to his own thinking and corporeal, while his passive faculty must be incorporeal (unless God is deliberately deceiving us, and then in this case the active faculty would be from God). This is the opposite of the traditional explanation found for example in Alexander of Aphrodisias and discussed above, for whom the passive intellect is material, while the active intellect is not. One result is that in many Aristotelian conceptions of the ''nous'', for example that of [[Thomas Aquinas]], the senses are still a source of all the intellect's conceptions. However, with the strict separation of mind and body proposed by Descartes, it becomes possible to propose that there can be thought about objects never perceived with the body's senses, such as a [[chiliagon|thousand sided geometrical figure]]. [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]] objected to this distinction between the imagination and the intellect in Descartes.&lt;ref&gt;The Philosophical Works of Descartes Vol. II, 1968, translated by Haldane and Ross, p.190&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes also objected, and according to his own philosophical approach asserted that the "triangle in the mind comes from the triangle we have seen" and "[[essence]] in so far as it is distinguished from [[existence]] is nothing else than a union of names by means of the verb is". Descartes, in his reply to this objection insisted that this traditional distinction between essence and existence is "known to all".&lt;ref&gt;The Philosophical Works of Descartes Vol. II, 1968, translated by Haldane and Ross, p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

His contemporary [[Blaise Pascal]], criticised him in similar words to those used by Plato's Socrates concerning Anaxagoras, discussed above, saying that "I cannot forgive Descartes; in all his philosophy, Descartes did his best to dispense with God. But Descartes could not avoid prodding God to set the world in motion with a snap of his lordly fingers; after that, he had no more use for God."&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkexist.com/quotation/i_cannot_forgive_descartes-in_all_his_philosophy/153298.html Think Exist on Blaise Pascal]. Retrieved 12 Feb. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes argued that when the intellect does a job of helping people interpret what they perceive, not with the help of an intellect which enters from outside, but because each human mind comes into being with innate God-given ideas, more similar then, to Plato's theory of ''anamnesis'', only not requiring [[reincarnation]]. Apart from such examples as the geometrical definition of a triangle, another example is the idea of God, according to the 3rd ''Meditation''. Error, according to the 4th ''Meditation'', comes about because people make judgments about things which are not in the intellect or understanding. This is possible because the human [[will (philosophy)|will]], being free, is not limited like the human intellect.

Spinoza, though considered a Cartesian and a rationalist, rejected Cartesian dualism and idealism. In his "[[pantheistic]]" approach, explained for example in his ''Ethics'', God is the same as nature, the human intellect is just the same as the human will. The divine intellect of nature is quite different from human intellect, because it is finite, but Spinoza does accept that the human intellect is a part of the infinite divine intellect.

Leibniz, in comparison to the guiding principle of the empiricists described above, added some words ''nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu'', '''''nisi intellectus ipsi''''' ("nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses" ''except the intellect itself'').&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; Despite being at the forefront of modern science, and modernist philosophy, in his writings he still referred to the active and passive intellect, a divine intellect, and the immortality of the active intellect.

[[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], partly in reaction to Locke, also attempted to reintroduce an "immaterialism" into early modern philosophy (later referred to as "[[subjective idealism]]" by others). He argued that individuals can only know sensations and ideas of objects, not abstractions such as "[[matter]]", and that ideas depend on perceiving minds for their very existence. This belief later became immortalized in the dictum, ''[[esse est percipi]]'' ("to be is to be perceived"). As in classical and medieval philosophy, Berkeley believed understanding had to be explained by divine intervention, and that all our ideas are put in our mind by God.

Hume accepted some of Berkeley's corrections of Locke, but in answer insisted, as had Bacon and Hobbes, that absolute knowledge is not possible, and that all attempts to show how it could be possible have logical problems. Hume's writings remain highly influential on all philosophy afterwards, and are for example considered by Kant to have shaken him from an intellectual slumber.

Kant, a turning point in modern philosophy, agreed with some classical philosophers and Leibniz that the intellect itself, although it needed sensory experience for understanding to begin, needs something else in order to make sense of the incoming sense information. In his formulation the intellect (''Verstand'') has ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' or innate principles which it has before thinking even starts. Kant represents the starting point of [[German idealism]] and a new phase of modernity, while empiricist philosophy has also continued beyond Hume to the present day.

==More recent modern philosophy and science==
One of the results of the early modern philosophy has been the increasing creation of specialist fields of science, in areas that were once considered part of philosophy, and [[infant cognitive development]] and [[perception]] now tend to be discussed now more within the sciences of [[psychology]] and [[neuroscience]] than in philosophy.

Modern mainstream thinking on the mind is not dualist, and sees anything innate in the mind as being a result of [[nature and nurture|genetic and developmental]] factors which allow the mind to develop. Overall it accepts far less innate "knowledge" (or clear pre-dispositions to particular types of knowledge) than most of the classical and medieval theories derived from philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus and Al Farabi.

Apart from discussions about the history of philosophical discussion on this subject, contemporary philosophical discussion concerning this point has continued concerning what the ethical implications are of the different alternatives still considered likely.

Classical conceptions of nous are still discussed seriously in theology. There is also still discussion of classical nous in non-mainstream metaphysics or spiritualism, such as [[Noetics]], promoted for example by the [[Institute of Noetic Sciences]].

The [[Elder Futhark]] '''Odal''' [[rune]] ({{script|Runr|ᛟ}}), also known as the '''Othala''' rune, represents the ''o'' sound. Its reconstructed [[Proto-Germanic]] name is *''ōþalan'' "heritage; inheritance, inherited estate".

It was in use for [[epigraphy]] during the 3rd to the 8th centuries. It is not continued in the [[Younger Futhark]], disappearing from the Scandinavian record around the 6th century, but it survived in the [[Anglo-Saxon Futhorc]], and expressed the Old English ''œ'' phoneme during the 7th and 8th centuries.
Its name is attested as ''ēðel'' in the Anglo-Saxon manuscript tradition.

The rune is encoded in [[Unicode]] at code point U+16DF: '''{{script|Runr|ᛟ}}'''.

==Name and etymology==
{{further| Ethel}}
The [[Common Germanic]] stem ''ōþala-'' or ''ōþila-'' "inherited estate" is an [[ablaut]] variant of the stem ''aþal-''.  It consists of a root ''aþ-'' and a suffix ''-ila-'' or ''-ala-''. The suffix variant accounts for the umlauted form  ''ēþel''.  Germanic ''aþal‑'' had a meaning of (approximately) "nobility", and the derivation ''aþala‑'' could express "lineage, (noble) race, descent, kind", and thus "nobleman, prince" (whence Old English [[atheling]]), but also "inheritance, inherited estate, property, possession". Its etymology is not clear, but it is usually compared to ''atta'' "father" (cf. the name [[Attila]], ultimately [[Mama and papa|baby talk for "father"]]).

There is an apparent, but debated, etymological connection of ''Odal'' to ''Adel'' (Old High German adal or edil), meaning ''nobility, noble family line, or exclusive group of superior social status; aristocracy'', typically associated with major land holdings and fortifications.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Adel]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sps|date=April 2017}}

The term ''oþal'' ([[Old High German]] ''uodal'') is a formative element in some [[Germanic name]]s, notably ''[[Ulrich]]'' and variants;, the stem ''aþal'' is more frequent, found in Gothic names such as [[Athalaric]], [[Ataulf]], etc. and in Old High German names such as ''[[Adalbert (given name)|Adalbert]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Schönfeld, Wörterbuch der altgermanischen Personen- und Völkernamen, 1911, 1f. (Adalharius, Adalhildis, Adalwal, Adaric, Adica, Adila), 33ff. (Athala, Athalaricus, Athanagildus, Athanaricus, Athavulfus), Reichert, Lexikon der altgermanischen Namen 2, 1990, 469 (Adalhari, Adalhildis, Adulouuald, Adaluuial, Atala, Athala, Athalaric, Adaric, Alaric)&lt;/ref&gt; and
Adel.  Unrelated, but difficult to separate etymologically, is the root ''aud-'' "wealth, property, possession, prosperity";&lt;ref&gt;Pokorny (1959), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; from this root are names such as
''[[Edmund (given name)|Edmund]]'' and other [[England|English]] names with the ''ed'' prefix (from [[Old English]] ''ead''), [[Germany|German]] ''[[Otto]]'' and various [[Germanic name]]s beginning with ''ed-'' or ''od-''. Possibly related is ''euþa, euþu'' a word for "child, offspring" (attested in Old Norse ''jóð'', and possibly in the name of the [[Iuthungi]]).

Odal was associated with the concept of inheritance in ancient Scandinavian property law. Some of these laws are still in effect today, and govern Norwegian property. These are the ''[[Åsetesrett]]'' (homestead right), and the ''[[Odelsrett]]'' ([[allodial right]]).

==Elder Futhark ''o''-rune==
[[File:Thorsberg Ortband.png|thumb|300px|Illustration of the Thorsberg chape showing the runic inscriptions on both sides.]]
The ''o''-rune is attested early, in inscriptions from the 3rd century, such as the [[Thorsberg chape]] ([http://abdn.ac.uk/skaldic/db.php?table=mss&amp;id=18836 DR7])  and the [[Vimose inscriptions|Vimose planer]] (''Vimose-Høvelen'', [http://abdn.ac.uk/skaldic/db.php?if=runic&amp;table=mss&amp;id=19030 DR 206]).
The letter is derived from a [[Old Italic alphabets|Raetia]]n variant of the letter [[O]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The corresponding [[Gothic alphabet|Gothic letter]] is {{script|Goth|𐍉}} (derived from Greek [[Omega|Ω]]), which had the name ''oþal''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Wolfgang Krause (1964) has speculated that the ''o'' rune is used as an ideograph denoting possession in the Thorsberg chape inscription.  The inscription has ''owlþuþewaz'', read by Krause as ''O[þila] - W[u]lþu-þewaz'' "inherited property - the servant of [[Ullr|Wulþuz]]".&lt;ref&gt;

Krause, Wolfgang, Herbert Jankuhn.  ''Die Runeninschriften im älteren Futhark'', Göttingen, 1966.
The interpretation by Krause follows an earlier suggestion by Helmut Arntz, ''Handbuch der Runenkunde'', 2nd ed., Halle/Saale 1944.  See also {{cite book |last=Spurkland |first=Terje |authorlink= |title=Norwegian Runes and Runic Inscriptions |publisher=Boydell Press |year=2005 |location= |pages=47–48 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QDKqY-NWvUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false  |doi=  |isbn=1-84383-186-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The odal rune is found in some transitional inscriptions of the 6th or 7th century, such as the [[Gummarp Runestone|Gummarp]], [[Björketorp Runestone|Björketorp]] and [[Stentoften Runestone|Stentoften]] runestones, but it disappears from the Scandinavian record by the 8th century. The [[Old Norse]] ''o'' phoneme is now written in [[Younger Futhark]] with the same letter as the ''u'' phoneme, the [[Ur rune]].

==Anglo-Saxon ''œ''-rune==
The [[Anglo-Saxon runes]] preserve the full set of 24 Elder Futhark runes (besides introducing innovations), but in some cases these runes are given new sound values due to [[Anglo-Frisian]] sound changes.  The odal rune is such a case: the ''o'' sound in the Anglo-Saxon system is now expressed by ''ōs'' ᚩ, a derivation of the old [[Ansuz rune]]; the odal rune is now known as ''ēðel'' (with [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] due to the form ''ōþila-'') and is used to express an ''œ'' sound, but is attested only rarely in epigraphy (outside of simply appearing in a futhark row). Epigraphical attestations include:
*the Frisian [[Westeremden yew-stick]], possibly as part of a given name ''Ƿimod'' (''Ƿimœd'')
*the Harford (Norfolk) brooch, dated c. 650, in a finite verb form: ''luda:gibœtæsigilæ'' "Luda repaired the brooch"
*the left panel of the [[Franks Casket]], twice: '' tƿœgen gibroþær afœddæ hiæ ƿylif'' "two brothers (scil. [[Romulus and Remus]]), a she-wolf nourished them".

The [[Anglo-Saxon rune poem]] preserves the meaning "an inherited estate" for the rune name:
{|
| style="padding-left:20pt;" |
&lt;poem&gt;
''{{runic|ᛟ}} byþ oferleof æghƿylcum men,''
''gif he mot ðær rihtes and gerysena on''
''brucan on bolde bleadum oftast.''
&lt;/poem&gt;
| style="padding-left:20pt;" |
&lt;poem&gt;
[An estate] is very dear to every man,
if he can enjoy there in his house
whatever is right and proper in constant prosperity.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|}

==Modern use==

===Germany===

[[File:23adivss.gif|thumb|Insignia of the [[23rd SS Volunteer Panzer Grenadier Division Nederland]].]]
The rendition of the Odal rune with ''wings'' or ''feet'' ([[serifs]]) was the emblem of ''ethnic Germans'' (''{{lang|de|Volksdeutsche}}'') of the [[7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen]] operating during World War II in the [[Nazi Germany]]-sponsored [[Independent State of Croatia]].  This rendition has been used by the Neo-Nazi {{lang|de|[[Wiking-Jugend]]}} in Germany, and in [[South Africa]] by the Anglo-Afrikaner Bond, the {{lang|af|[[Boeremag]]}}, the {{lang|af|[[Blanke Bevrydingsbeweging]]}},&lt;ref&gt;Schönteich, Martin and Boshoff, Henri ''Volk, faith and fatherland: the security threat posed by the white right'' Institute for Security Studies (South Africa)(2003) p48&lt;/ref&gt; and the Italian neo-fascist group [[National Vanguard (Italy)|National Vanguard]]. This particular rendition has no historical significance outside of Nazi Germany. Because of its Nazi associations, ''[[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|Strafgesetzbuch 86a]]'' bans any usage of the Odal rune as with most other symbols if used in a Neo-Nazi context.

Another version with arrows on the end was used by the [[23rd SS Volunteer Panzer Grenadier Division Nederland]].

===South Africa===
It was used by the Afrikaner Student Federation and the far-right wing [[Blanke Bevrydingsbeweging|White Liberation Movement]]. &lt;ref name="flagspot"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://flagspot.net/flags/qt-z_sym.html#odal|title=Neo-Nazi flag symbolism|publisher=flagspot.net|accessdate=2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Visser, Myda Marista ''Die Ideologiese Grondslae En Ontwikkeling Van Die Blanke Fascistiese Bewegings In Suid-Afrika, 1945- 1995'' (The ideological foundations and development of white fascist movements in South Africa, 1945-1999) M.A. Thesis University of Pretoria (1999) p164&lt;/ref&gt;
===United States===
In November 2016, the leadership of the [[National Socialist Movement (United States)|National Socialist Movement]] announced their intention to replace the [[swastika]] with the Odal rune on their uniforms and party regalia in an attempt to enter mainstream politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/americas-white-supremacists-ban-swastika-in-bold-attempt-to-go-mainstream/news-story/53f68100ba52a1e33b13cf25b794d028|title=Bizarre, bold reason America’s white supremacists just banned swastika|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germanic neopaganism===
The rendition of the Othala rune both with and without feet/wings ([[serifs]]) is used by [[Odinism|Odinists]] and [[Asatru]]ar interchangeably, usually without any relation to [[National Socialism]] or the [[Völkisch movement]].

===Other===
The Odal rune was used as one of the protection runes of the [[Shadowhunters]] in the film adaptation of the first in the series of [[Cassandra Clare]] books City of Bones. It was shown prominently on the character poster for Izzy, who wears it on her collarbone. It was also used throughout promotional material to highlight the stories themes of family and inheritance.

An instrumental track on [[Agalloch]]'s second album, [[The Mantle]], is called ''Odal''.

The 8th track of [[Wardruna]]'s third album, [[Runaljod - Ragnarok]], is called ''Odal''. The song ends with a long pronunciation of the name.

In April 2014, the British [[Topman]] clothing company were forced to apologize after using the Nazi version with wings/feet in one of their clothing lines.&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2603624/Topman-forced-apologise-selling-jacket-SS-symbol-chest.html|title=Topman forced to apologise after selling jacket with SS symbol on chest &amp;#124; Daily Mail Online|publisher=dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The television show ''[[Sleepy Hollow (TV series)|Sleepy Hollow]]'' used the version with wings/feet in season 3, calling it the emblem of Thura.

The superhero web serial ''[[Worm (web serial)|Worm]]'' features a white supremacist supervillain called Othala, who wears the rune (with serifs) as her emblem.

In the second book in the [[Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard]] series by [[Rick Riordan]], the Othala rune is translated as “inheritance.” This is particularly significant to Hearthstone, representing his brother’s death and his abuse at the hands of his father.

'''The Offences against the Person Act 1875''' (38 &amp; 39 Vict. c. 94) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (as it then was). Its purpose was to extend the scope of sexual offences against children.

==Section 2==
This section repealed sections 50 and 51 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] with savings.

==Section 3 - Abusing a girl under 12==
This section replaced section 50 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (which created a felony in relation only to girls under 10).

When the Act was repealed, it was in turn replaced by section 4 of the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]] (increasing the age to 13).

==Section 4 - Abusing a girl between 12 and 13==
This section replaced section 51 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (which created a misdemeanour in relation to girls between 10 and 12).

When the Act was repealed, it was turn replaced by section 5(1) of the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]] (changing the age range to 13 to 16).

==Section 5==
This section provided that the Act was to be construed as though it and the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (as amended by this Act) were one Act. Its effect was that the definition of [[carnal knowledge]] provided by section 63 of that Act applied to the offences created by sections 3 and 4 of this Act.

==Section 6 - Extent==
This section provided that the Act did not extend to Scotland.

'''Photo manipulation''' involves [[image editing|transforming or altering]] a [[photograph]] using various methods and techniques to achieve desired results.  Some photo manipulations are considered skillful artwork while others are frowned upon as unethical practices, especially when used to deceive the public, such as that used for political [[propaganda]], or to make a product or person look better.

Depending on the application and intent, some photo manipulations are considered an [[art form]] because it involves the creation of unique images and in some instances, signature expressions of art by photographic artists.  For example, [[Ansel Adams]] employed some of the more common manipulations using [[Burning and dodging|darkroom exposure techniques]], such as burning (darkening) and dodging (lightening) a photograph.&lt;ref name=Dziamba&gt;{{cite web | url = https://whitherthebook.wordpress.com/2013/02/27/ansel-adams-and-photography-before-photoshop/ | title = Ansel Adams, and Photography Before Photoshop | author = Jack Dziamba | date = February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite interview | title=Artbeat | date=November 29, 2012 | accessdate=January 30, 2016 | author=Mia Fineman | interviewer=Tom Legro | work=PBS Newshour | publisher=WPBT2 | location=South Florida | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/slide-show-what-did-we-do-before-photoshop/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other examples of photo manipulation include retouching photographs using ink or paint, [[airbrushing]], [[double exposure (photography)|double exposure]], piecing photos or negatives together in the darkroom, scratching [[instant film]]s, or through the use of software-based manipulation tools applied to digital images.  There are a number of software applications available for digital image manipulation, ranging from professional applications to very basic imaging software for casual users.

Photo manipulation dates back to some of the earliest photographs captured on [[ambrotype|glass]] and [[tintype|tin plates]] during the [[19th century]].  The practice began not long after the creation of the first photograph (1825) by [[Joseph Nicéphore Niépce]] who developed [[heliography]] and made the first photographic print from a photoengraved printing plate.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1885093.stm | publisher = BBC News | date = 21 March 2002 | title = World's oldest photo sold to library | quote = The image of an engraving depicting a man leading a horse was made in 1825 by Nicephore Niepce, who invented a technique known as heliogravure. | accessdate = 2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Farid&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~beki/cs4001/history.pdf/ | title = Photo Tampering Throughout History | first = Hany | last = Farid | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150908155915/http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~beki/cs4001/history.pdf | archivedate = September 8, 2015 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional photographic prints can be altered using various methods and techniques that involve manipulation directly to the print, such as retouching with ink, paint, [[airbrush]]ing, or scratching [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroids]] during developing.&lt;ref name=Scratch&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pola-art.de/technique/ | title=How to manipulate SX-70? | work = Polaroid SX-70 Art | publisher = Skylab Portfolio | editor = Klaus Wolfer | accessdate = February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Negatives can be manipulated while still in the camera using double-exposure techniques, or in the [[darkroom]] by piecing photos or negatives together.  Some darkroom manipulations involved techniques such as bleaching to artfully lighten or totally wash-out parts of the photograph, or hand coloring for aesthetic purposes or to mimic a fine art painting.&lt;ref name="Warren"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=31VsBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1007&amp;lpg=PA1007&amp;dq=Darkroom+manipulations+are+traditional+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jUu90y8I9B&amp;sig=kvs9Yqgq1XxCNdql9kzwCuunev4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj03Nm4sNLKAhVFWCYKHSqrAwgQ6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Darkroom%20manipulations%20are%20traditional%20art&amp;f=false | title=Encyclopedia of Twentieth-Century Photography, 3-Volume Set | publisher=Routledge | author=Lynne Warren | authorlink=Robert Maplethorpe | year=2006 | pages=1007 | isbn=9781135205362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, photography and the technology that made it possible was rather crude and cumbersome. While the equipment and technology progressed over time, it was not until the late [[20th century]] that photography evolved into the digital realm. At the onset, digital photography was considered by some to be a radical new approach, and was initially rejected by photographers because of its substandard quality.&lt;ref name="Peres"&gt;{{cite book|last=Peres|first=Michael|title=The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography, Fourth Edition|year=2007|publisher=Focal Press; 4 edition|isbn=0-240-80740-5|page= Preface, 24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYyldcYfq3MC&amp;pg=PR23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transition from film to digital has been an ongoing process although great strides were made in the early 21st century as a result of advancing technology that has greatly improved digital image quality while reducing the bulk and weight of cameras and equipment.&lt;ref name=Adobe&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.adobe.com/digitalimag/pdfs/phscs2ip_filmtodig.pdf | publisher = Adobe Systems Incorporated | title = Making The Transition From Film To Digital |author-first=Michael |author-last=Reichmann |author-link=Michael Reichmann | date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early manipulation===
An early example of tampering was in the early 1860s, when a photo of [[Abraham Lincoln]] was altered using the body from a portrait of [[John C. Calhoun]] and the head of Lincoln from a famous seated portrait by [[Mathew Brady]] – the [[United States five-dollar bill#The redesigned .245 bill|same portrait]] which was the basis for the [[United States five-dollar bill#Small size note history|original]] Lincoln [[United States five-dollar bill|five-dollar bill]].&lt;ref name=Farid/&gt;  Another is exampled in the [[Library of Congress]] ''Prints and Photographs Online Catalogue'' wherein it exposes a manipulated [[American Civil War]] photograph of [[General Ulysses S. Grant]] posing horseback in front of his troops at [[City Point, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=LOC&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/cwp/mystery.html | title=Civil War Glass Negatives and Related Prints – Solving a Civil War Photograph Mystery | publisher = [[Library of Congress]] | accessdate=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Close observation of the photograph raises questions and brings to light certain details in the photograph that simply do not add up. For example, Grant's head is set at a strange angle to his body, his uniform is of a different time period, and his favorite horse [[Cincinnati (horse)|Cincinnati]] did not have a left hind sock like the horse in the photograph, although his other horse Egypt did have a sock but on a different foot. With further research, three different photographs were discovered that explained the composite using Grant's head from one photograph, the body of [[Alexander McDowell McCook|Major General Alexander McDowell McCook]] atop his horse from another photograph, and for the background, an 1864 photograph of [[Confederate Army of the Shenandoah|Confederate prisoners]] captured at the [[Battle of Fisher's Hill]].&lt;ref name=LOC/&gt;

In the 20th century, digital retouching became available with [[Quantel]] computers running [[Quantel Paintbox|Paintbox]] in professional environments,&lt;ref name=Sasso&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-I2M80f7KwC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=digital+retouching+with+Quantel+computers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-XxMvomiqd&amp;sig=nHuh9O8oHmq5Wfrp89VfzxJqUfQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLvNH7x9LKAhXLQyYKHcikBAMQ6AEIQzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=digital%20retouching%20with%20Quantel%20computers&amp;f=false | title = Abduzeedo Inspiration Guide for Designers | author = Fabio Sasso | publisher = Pearson Education | page = 124 | isbn = 9780132684729|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, alongside other contemporary packages, were effectively replaced in the market by [[Adobe Photoshop]] and other editing software for [[Graphic image developer|graphic imaging]].

==Political and ethical issues==

Photo manipulation has been used to deceive or persuade viewers or improve storytelling and self-expression.&lt;ref name="Rotman"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qQE0OLSIXsEC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=photograph+has+an+inherent+verisimilitude&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jK-70MnrPz&amp;sig=UBZKrOzqpvyLfuqnQLbRO2u4Gew&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3oqSs5sXKAhXEupQKHRoBD2YQ6AEINzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=photograph%20has%20an%20inherent%20verisimilitude&amp;f=false | title=Becoming Beside Ourselves: The Alphabet, Ghosts, and Distributed Human Being | publisher=Duke University Press | author=Rotman, Brian | year=2008 | pages=96–97 | isbn=978-0822341833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often even subtle and discreet changes can have a profound impact on how we interpret or judge a photograph, making it all the more important to know when or if manipulation has occurred.  As early as the American Civil War, photographs were published as engravings based on more than one negative.&lt;ref name="Palmquist"&gt;{{cite book | title=Pioneer Photographers from the Mississippi to the Continental Divide: A Biographical Dictionary, 1839-1865 | publisher=Stanford University Press | author=Peter E. Palmquist, Thomas R. Kailbourn | year=2005 | pages=55 | isbn=978-0804740579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Stalin]] made use of photo retouching for propaganda purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=D. |year=1997 |title=The Commissar Vanishes: the falsification of photographs and art in Stalin's Russia |publisher=Metropolitan Books |location=New York |isbn=0-8050-5294-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 5, 1920 his predecessor [[Vladimir Lenin]] held a speech for Soviet troops that [[Leon Trotsky]] attended. Stalin had Trotsky retouched out of a photograph showing Trotsky in attendance.&lt;ref name="Ammann"&gt;{{cite book | first=Daniel |last=Ammann | title=[[The King of Oil: The Secret Lives of Marc Rich]] | publisher=Macmillan | year=2009 | pages=228 | isbn=978-1429986854}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a well known case of ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' image manipulation, [[NKVD]] leader [[Nikolai Yezhov]] (the "Vanishing Commissar"), after his execution in 1940, was removed from an official press photo where he was pictured with Stalin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newseum.org/berlinwall/commissar_vanishes/vanishes.htm|title="The Commissar Vanishes" in The Vanishing Commissar|author=The Newseum|date=Sep 1, 1999|accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (For more information, see [[Censorship of images in the Soviet Union]].)
The pioneer among journalists distorting photographic images for news value was [[Bernarr Macfadden]]: in the mid-1920s, his "[[composograph]]" process involved reenacting real news events with costumed [[body double]]s and then photographing the dramatized scenes—then pasting faces of the real news-personalities (gathered from unrelated photos) onto his staged images. In the 1930s, artist [[John Heartfield]] used a type of photo manipulation known as the [[photomontage]] to critique [[propaganda in Nazi Germany|Nazi propaganda]].

Some ethical theories have been applied to image manipulation. During a panel on the topic of ethics in image manipulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1179176 | title = Ethics in image manipulation | conference = International Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-59593-364-6 | first1 = Kathryn | last1 = Carlson | first2 = Brian | last2 = DeLevie | first3 = Aude | last3 = Oliva | doi = 10.1145/1179171.1179176 | publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] | booktitle = ACM SIGGRAPH 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aude Oliva]] theorized that categorical shifts are necessary in order for an edited image to be viewed as a manipulation. In ''Image Act Theory'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last = Reynolds | first = C. J. | title = Image Act Theory | conference = Seventh International Conference of Computer Ethics | date = July 12–14, 2007 | url = http://www.k2.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/members/carson/papers/reynolds_cepe2007.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080528064429/http://www.k2.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/members/carson/papers/reynolds_cepe2007.pdf | archivedate = May 28, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carson Reynolds extended [[speech act]] theory by applying it to photo editing and image manipulations. In "How to Do Things with Pictures",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl = http://www.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/Mitchell/MitchellHow.html | chapter =  How to Do Things with Pictures | first = William John | last = Mitchell |authorlink=William J. Mitchell| title = The Reconfigured Eye: Visual Truth in the Post-Photographic Era | publisher=MIT Press | year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William J. Mitchell]] details the long history of photo manipulation and discusses it critically.

=== Use in journalism ===
{{see also|Photojournalism#Ethical and legal considerations}}
A notable incident of controversial photo manipulation occurred over a photograph that was altered to fit the vertical orientation of a 1982 ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' magazine cover.  The altered image made two [[Egyptian pyramids]] appear closer together than they actually were in the original photograph.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/04/magazine/photography-s-new-bag-of-tricks.html?pagewanted=4|publisher=The New York Times Company | date=November 4, 1984 | author=Fred Ritchin | title=Photography's New Bag Of Tricks | accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident triggered a debate about the appropriateness of falsifying an image,&lt;ref name=BRONXDOC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alteredimagesbdc.org/national-geographic/ | title=National Geographic — Altered Images | publisher=Bronx Documentary Center | accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised questions regarding the magazine's credibility.  Shortly after the incident, Tom Kennedy, director of photography for ''National Geographic'' stated,  "We no longer use that technology to manipulate elements in a photo simply to achieve a more compelling graphic effect. We regarded that afterwards as a mistake, and we wouldn’t repeat that mistake today."&lt;ref name=BRONXDOC/&gt;

There are other incidents of questionable photo manipulation in journalism.  One such incident arose in early 2005 after [[Martha Stewart]] was released from prison. ''[[Newsweek]]'' used a photograph of Stewart's face on the body of a much slimmer woman for their cover, suggesting that Stewart had lost weight while in prison.&lt;ref name= NYT2005&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/03/business/media/martha-stewart-gets-new-body-in-newsweek.html?_r=0 | title = Martha Stewart Gets New Body In Newsweek | publisher=New York Times | author =  Jonathan D. Glater | date=March 3, 2005 | accessdate=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking about the incident in an interview, Lynn Staley, assistant managing editor at ''Newsweek'' said, "The piece that we commissioned was intended to show Martha as she would be, not necessarily as she is." Staley also explained that ''Newsweek'' disclosed on page 3 that the cover image of Martha Stewart was a composite.&lt;ref name=NYT2005/&gt;

Image manipulation software has affected the level of trust many viewers once had in the aphorism, the camera never lies.&lt;ref name=IntlNYT2004&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/11/technology/the-camera-never-lies-but-the-software-can.html | title=The Camera Never Lies, But The Software Can | publisher= The New York Times Company | author = Katie Hefner | date=March 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images may be manipulated for fun, aesthetic reasons, or to improve the appearance of a subject&lt;ref name=Photo&gt;{{cite book|last=Kitchin|first=Rob|title=Code/Space: Software and Everyday Life|year=2011|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=0-262-04248-7|chapter=6 | page=120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHez2BXgIeQC&amp;pg=PA120}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not all image manipulation is innocuous as evidenced by the [[Kerry Fonda 2004 election photo controversy]]. The image in question was a fraudulent composite image of [[John Kerry]] taken on June 13, 1971 and [[Jane Fonda]] taken in August, 1972 sharing the same platform at a 1971 antiwar rally; the latter of which carried a fake [[Associated Press]] credit with the intent to change the public's perspective of reality.&lt;ref name="IntlNYT2004"/&gt;

There is a growing body of writings devoted to the ethical use of digital editing in [[photojournalism]]. In the United States, for example, the [[National Press Photographers Association]] (NPPA) established a Code of Ethics which promotes the accuracy of published images, advising that photographers "do not manipulate images [...] that can mislead viewers or misrepresent subjects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://nppa.org/code_of_ethics | title = NPPA Code of Ethics | publisher=[[National Press Photographers Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infringements of the Code are taken very seriously, especially regarding digital alteration of published photographs, as evidenced by a case in which [[Pulitzer prize]]-nominated photographer [[Allan Detrich]] resigned his post following the revelation that a number of his photographs had been manipulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.pdnonline.com/pdn/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003571795 | title = Blade Editor: Detrich Submitted 79 Altered Photos This Year | work=[[Photo District News]] | date = April 15, 2007 | first = Daryl | last = Lang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a Ukrainian photographer Stepan Rudik, winner of the 3rd prize story in Sports Features, has been disqualified due to violation of the rules of the [[World Press Photo of the Year|World Press Photo]] contest. "After requesting [[Raw image format|RAW-files]] of the series from him, it became clear that an element had been removed from one of the original photographs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Announcement of disqualification|url = http://www.worldpressphoto.org/news/2010-03-03/announcement-disqualification|website = World Press Photo|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, up to 20%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Press Photo Organizer: 20% of Finalists Disqualified|url = http://time.com/3706626/world-press-photo-processing-manipulation-disqualified/|website = TIME.com|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; of World Press Photo entries that made it to the penultimate round of the contest were disqualified after they were found to have been manipulated or post-processed with rules violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What counts as manipulation?|url = http://www.worldpressphoto.org/activities/photo-contest/verification-process/what-counts-as-manipulation|website = World Press Photo|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use in the Fashion Industry  ===
The photo manipulation industry has often been accused of promoting or inciting a distorted and unrealistic image of self; most specifically in younger people. The world of [[glamour photography]] is one specific industry which has been heavily involved with the use of photo manipulation (what many consider to be a concerning element as many people look up to celebrities in search of embodying the 'ideal figure').&lt;ref name=photo/&gt;  Manipulation of a photo to alter a model’s appearance can be used to change features such as skin complexion, hair color, body shape, and other features.  Many of the alterations to skin involve removing blemishes through the use of the healing tool in Photoshop.  Photo editors may also alter the color of hair to remove roots or add shine.  Additionally, the model’s teeth and eyes may be made to look whiter than they are in reality. [[Cosmetics|Make up]] and [[body piercing|piercings]] can even be edited into pictures to look as though the model was wearing them when the photo was taken.  Through photo editing, the appearance of a model may be drastically changed to mask imperfections.&lt;ref&gt;Metzmacher, Dirk. "Smashing Magazine." Smashing Magazine. N.p., n.d. Web. April 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article entitled, Confessions of a Retoucher: how the modeling industry is harming women, a professional retoucher who has worked for mega-fashion brands shares the industry’s secrets. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/beauty/confessions-of-a-retoucher-how-the-modelling-industry-is-harming-women-20171006-gyvqf2.html|title=Confessions of a retoucher: how the modelling industry is harming women|last=Cage|first=Carolyn|date=2017-10-06|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with fixing imperfections like skin wrinkles and smoothing features, the size of the model is manipulated by either adding or subtracting visible weight. Reverse retouching is just as common as making models skinnier, “distorting the bodies of very thin models to make them appear more robust in a process called reverse retouching. It is almost worse than making someone slimmer because the image claims you can be at an unhealthy weight but still look healthy. In reality, you can't, you have to Photoshop it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/beauty/confessions-of-a-retoucher-how-the-modelling-industry-is-harming-women-20171006-gyvqf2.html|title=Confessions of a retoucher: how the modelling industry is harming women|last=Cage|first=Carolyn|date=2017-10-06|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reverse retouching includes eliminating shadows from protruding bones, adding flesh over body parts, color correcting, and removing hair generated for warmth from extreme weight loss. Professionals are saying that if an image is not label "not retouched," then the public can assume that photograph has been modified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/how-retouched-photos-impact-our-mental-health-2018-3|title=Here's how retouched photos impact our mental health|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the fashion industry continues to use photos that have been manipulated to idealize body types, there is a need for education about how unreal and unhealthy these images are and the negative implications they are promoting. 

=== Photo manipulation on social media ===
Not only are photos being manipulated by professionals for the media, but also with the rise of social media everyone has easy access to edit photos they post online.  Countless Apps have been created to allow smartphone user tools to modify personal images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/12/health/girls-social-media-self-image-partner/index.html|title=How girls use social media to build up, break down self-image|last=Media|first=Caroline Knorr, Common Sense|work=CNN|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These apps allow people to edit virtually every aspect in the photo focusing on the face and body represented. With social media users and the younger generation being exposed to an extreme amount of imagery that has been manipulated the consequences have a negative impact as body ideals are unachievable.  Social media has the opportunity to be used as a platform for promoting healthy body image and unedited photos; the need for approval over social media has to be altered in the near future.  

===Celebrities against photo manipulation===
Photo manipulation has triggered negative responses from both viewers and celebrities. This has led to celebrities refusing to have their photos retouched in support of the [[American Medical Association]] that has decided that "[we] must stop exposing impressionable children and teenagers to advertisements portraying models with body types only attainable with the help of photo editing software"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/fashion/ama-takes-stand-photoshop-medical-association-altering-contributes-unrealistic-expectations-article-1.126921#ixzz1QUW2THCf|title=Photoshop contributes to unrealistic expectations of appropriate body image: AMA|website=NY Daily News|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include [[Keira Knightley]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Andy Roddick]], [[Jessica Simpson]], [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Zendaya]].

Brad Pitt had a photographer, [[Chuck Close]], take photos of him that emphasized all of his flaws. Chuck Close is known for his photos that emphasize all skin flaws of an individual. Pitt did so in an effort to speak out against media using photoshop and manipulating celebrities’ photos in an attempt to hide their flaws. Also, [[Kate Winslet]] spoke out against photo manipulation in media after ''[[GQ]]'' magazine altered her body, making it look unnaturally thin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keep It Real Challenge: Photoshop's Impact on Body Image|date= 29 June 2012|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://info.umkc.edu/womenc/2012/06/29/keep-it-real-challenge-photoshops-impact-on-body-image/|website=info.umkc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, [[Britney Spears]] agreed to release "un-airbrushed images of herself next to the digitally altered ones".&lt;ref name=photo&gt;{{cite news|title=Britney Spears bravely agrees to release un-airbrushed images of herself next to the digitally-altered versions|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1265676/Britney-Spears-releases-airbrushed-images-digitally-altered-versions.html|accessdate=March 23, 2012|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental motive behind her move was to "highlight the pressure exerted on women to look perfect".&lt;ref name=photo/&gt;

In addition, 42-year-old [[Cate Blanchett]] also appeared on the cover of [[1843 (magazine)|''Intelligent Life'']]'s 2012 March/April issue, makeup-free and without digital retouching for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Soraya|title=Cate Blanchett goes without digital enhancement on the cover of Intelligent Life|url=http://ca.omg.yahoo.com/blogs/the-juice-celeb-news/cate-blanchett-goes-without-digital-enhancement-cover-intelligent-154517034.html|publisher=The Juice|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Companies against photo manipulation===
Multiple companies have begun taking the initiative to speak out against the use of photo manipulation when advertising their products. Two companies that have done so include [[Dove (toiletries)|Dove]] and [[Aerie (American Eagle Outfitters)|Aerie]]. Dove created the Dove Self-Esteem Fund and also the [[Dove Campaign for Real Beauty]] as a way to try to help build confidence in young women. They want to emphasize what is known as real beauty, or untouched photographs, in the media now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Evolution Video – Dove Self Esteem Project|website=selfesteem.dove.us|date= 2 June 2013|accessdate=1 May 2015|url=http://selfesteem.dove.us/Articles/Video/Evolution_video_how_images_of_beauty_are_manipulated_by_the_media.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Aerie has started their campaign #AerieREAL. They have a line of undergarments now that goes by that name with the intention of them being for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Aerie for American Eagle|accessdate=1 May 2015|url=http://www.ae.com/featured-aeriereal/aerie/s-cat/6890055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, their advertisements state that the model has not been retouched in any way. They also add in their advertisements that "The real you is sexy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Krupnick|first=Ellie|title=Aerie's Unretouched Ads 'Challenge Supermodel Standards' For Young Women|newspaper= The Huffington Post|date=17 January 2014|accessdate=1 May 2015|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/17/aerie-unretouched-ads-photos_n_4618139.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the American Medical Association has taken a stand against the use of photo manipulation. Dr. McAneny made a statement that altering models to such extremes creates unrealistic expectations in children and teenagers regarding body image. He also said that we should stop altering the models so they are not exposed to body types that can be attained only through the use of editing the photos. The American Medical Associations as a whole adopted a policy to work with advertisers to work on setting up guidelines for advertisements to try to limit how much photoshop is used. The goal of this policy is to limit the amount of unrealistic expectations for body image in advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMA Adopts New Policies at Annual Meeting|date=21 June 2011|website=ama-assn.org|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/a11-new-policies.page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Governments against excessive photo manipulation ===
Governments are exerting pressure on advertisers, and are starting to ban photos that are too airbrushed and edited. In the United Kingdom the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] has banned an advertisement by [[Lancôme]] featuring [[Julia Roberts]] for being misleading, stating that the flawless skin seen in the photo was too good to be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zhang|first=Michael|title=Julia Roberts Makeup Ads Banned in UK for Too Much Photoshop|url=http://www.petapixel.com/2011/07/27/julia-roberts-makeup-ads-banned-in-uk-for-too-much-photoshop/|publisher=PetaPixel|accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The US is also moving in the direction of banning excessive photo manipulation where a [[CoverGirl]] model's ad  was banned because it had exaggerated effects, leading to a misleading representation of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anthony|first=Sebastian|title=US watchdog bans photoshopping in cosmetics ads|url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/109375-us-bans-photoshop-use-in-cosmetics-ads|accessdate=December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for photo manipulation in media===
Some editors of magazine companies do not view manipulating their [[cover model]]s as an issue. In an interview with the editor of the French magazine ''[[Marie Claire]]'', she stated that their readers are not idiots and that they can tell when a model has been retouched. Also, some who support photo manipulation in the media state that the altered photographs are not the issue, but that it is the expectations that viewers have that they fail to meet, such as wanting to have the same body as a celebrity on the cover of their favorite magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Defense of Photoshop: Why Retouching Isn't As Evil As Everyone Thinks|work= The Cut|date=29 August 2010|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2010/08/photoshop_retouching.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surveys done about photo manipulation===
Surveys have been done to see how photo manipulation affects society and to see what society thinks of it. One survey was done by a fashion store in the United Kingdom, [[New Look (company)|New Look]], and it showed that 90% of the individuals surveyed would prefer seeing a wider variety of body shapes in media. This would involve them wanting to see cover models that are not all thin, but some with more curves than others. The survey also talked about how readers view the use of photo manipulation. One statistic stated that 15% of the readers believed that the cover images are accurate depictions of the model in reality. Also, they found that 33% of women who were surveyed are aiming for a body that is impossible for them to attain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women Need Further Educating Into Extent of Digital Manipulation of Mo|website=prweb.com|date= 26 November 2013|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/11/prweb11361783.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dove also did a survey to see how photo manipulation affects the self-esteem of females. In doing this, they found that 80% of the women surveyed felt insecure when seeing photos of celebrities in the media. Of the women surveyed who had lower self-esteem, 71% of them do not believe that their appearance is pretty or stylish enough in comparison to cover models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Self Esteem Act: Parents Push for Anti-Photoshop Law in U.S. to Protect Teens from Unrealistic Body Image Ideals|publisher=Daily Mail Online|work=Associated Newspapers|date=12 October 2011|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2048375/Self-Esteem-Act-US-parents-push-anti-Photoshop-laws-advertising.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social and cultural implications ===

The growing popularity of image manipulation has raised concern as to whether it allows for unrealistic images to be portrayed to the public. In her article "[[On Photography]]" (1977), [[Susan Sontag]] discusses the objectivity, or lack thereof, in photography, concluding that "photographs, which fiddle with the scale of the world, themselves get reduced, blown up, cropped, retouched, doctored and tricked out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sontag | first = Susan | authorlink = Susan Sontag | year = 1977 | title = [[On Photography]] | page = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A practice widely used in the magazine industry, the use of photo manipulation on an already subjective photograph, creates a constructed reality for the individual and it can become difficult to differentiate fact from fiction. With the potential to alter body image, debate continues as to whether manipulated images, particularly those in magazines, contribute to self-esteem issues in both men and women.

In today's world, photo manipulation has a positive impact by developing the creativity of one's mind or maybe a negative one by removing the art and beauty of capturing something so magnificent and natural or the way it should be. According to ''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'', "Photoshopping and airbrushing, many believe, are now an inherent part of the beauty industry, as are makeup, lighting and styling".  In a way, these image alterations are "selling" actual people to the masses to affect responses, reactions, and emotions toward these cultural icons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=L. Boutwell|first=Allison|title=Photoshop: A Positive and Negative Innovation|url=http://allisonlboutwell.wordpress.com/2012/02/05/photoshopapositiveandnegativeinnovation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of digital photo manipulation ==
In digital editing, photographs are usually taken with a [[digital camera]] and input directly into a computer. [[reversal film|Transparencies]], [[Negative (photography)|negatives]] or printed photographs may also be [[digitized]] using a [[Image scanner|scanner]], or images may be obtained from [[stock photography]] databases. With the advent of computers, [[graphics tablet]]s, and digital cameras, the term ''image editing'' encompasses everything that can be done to a photo, whether in a [[darkroom]] or on a computer. Photo manipulation is often much more explicit than subtle alterations to color balance or contrast and may involve overlaying a head onto a different body or changing a sign's text, for examples. Image editing software can be used to apply effects and warp an image until the desired result is achieved. The resulting image may have little or no resemblance to the photo (or photos in the case of [[compositing]]) from which it originated. Today, photo manipulation is widely accepted as an [[art form]].

There are several subtypes of digital image-retouching:

;Technical retouching: Manipulation for photo restoration or enhancement. This can involve the adjustment of colors, contrast, [[white balance]] (i.e. gradational retouching) and sharpness, and the removal of noise, elements or visible flaws on skin or materials.

;Creative retouching: Used as an art form or for commercial use to create more sleek and interesting images for advertisements. Creative retouching could be manipulation for fashion, beauty or advertising photography such as pack-shots (which could also be considered inherently technical retouching in regards to package dimensions and wrap-around factors). One of the most prominent disciplines in creative retouching is image compositing whereby the digital artist uses multiple photos to create a single image. Today, [[3D computer graphics]] are used more and more to add extra elements or even locations and backgrounds. This kind of image composition is widely used when conventional photography would be technically too difficult or impossible to shoot on location or in studio.

''"Your eel, I think, Sir?"''
----
Cartoon in [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'' magazine]]: 28 July 1920]]

'''Politeness''' is the practical application of good manners or [[etiquette]]. It is a culturally defined phenomenon, and therefore what is considered polite in one [[culture]] can sometimes be quite [[rudeness|rude]] or simply eccentric in another [[cultural relativism|cultural context]].

While the goal of politeness is to make all of the parties relaxed and comfortable with one another, these culturally defined standards at times may be manipulated to inflict [[shame]] on a designated party.

==Types==
Anthropologists [[Penelope Brown]] and [[Stephen C. Levinson|Stephen Levinson]] identified two kinds of politeness, deriving from [[Erving Goffman]]'s concept of [[Face (self image)|face]]:
* '''Negative politeness''': Making a request less infringing, such as "If you don't mind..." or "If it isn't too much trouble..."; respects a person's right to act freely. In other words, ''deference''. There is a greater use of indirect [[speech acts]]. 
* '''Positive politeness''': Seeks to establish a positive relationship between parties; respects a person's need to be liked and understood. Direct speech acts, [[profanity|swearing]] and flouting [[Gricean maxim|Grice's maxims]] can be considered aspects of positive politeness because:
** they show an awareness that the relationship is strong enough to cope with what would normally be considered impolite (in the popular understanding of the term);
** they articulate an awareness of the other person's values, which fulfills the person's desire to be accepted.

Some cultures seem to prefer one of these kinds of politeness over the other. In this way politeness is culturally bound.

==History==
[[Image:Spectator.jpg|thumb|''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'' fostered a culture of politeness among the middle-classes of early 18th century [[England]].]]

During the [[Enlightenment era]], a self-conscious process of the imposition of polite norms and behaviours became a symbol of being a genteel member of the [[upper class]]. Upwardly mobile [[middle class]] [[bourgeoisie]] increasingly tried to identify themselves with the elite through their adopted artistic preferences and their standards of behaviour. They became preoccupied with precise rules of [[etiquette]], such as when to show [[emotion]], the art of elegant dress and graceful conversation and how to act courteously, especially with women. Influential in this new discourse was a series of essays on the nature of politeness in a commercial society, penned by the philosopher [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]] in the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H6u6QyCKE5YC|title=Shaftesbury and the Culture of Politeness: Moral Discourse and Cultural Politics in Early Eighteenth-Century England|author=[[Lawrence E. Klein]]|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaftesbury defined politeness as the art of being pleasing in company:
:'Politeness' may be defined a dext'rous management of our words and actions, whereby we make other people have better opinion of us and themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2738536?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102574372923|title=The Third Earl of Shaftesbury and the Progress of Politeness|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joseph Highmore - A Club of Gentlemen - Google Art Project.jpg|right|thumb|Members of a [[Gentlemen's club]] had to conform to a socially acceptable standard of politeness. The painting, ''A Club of Gentlemen'' by [[Joseph Highmore]] c. 1730.]]
Periodicals, such as ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'', founded as a daily publication by [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]] in 1711, gave regular advice to its readers on how to be a polite gentleman. Its stated goal was "to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with morality...to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and coffeehouses" It provided its readers with educated, topical talking points, and advice in how to carry on conversations and social interactions in a polite manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information-britain.co.uk/famdates.php?id=888 |title=Information Britain |publisher=Information Britain |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art of polite conversation and debate was particularly cultivated in the [[English coffeehouses in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries|coffeehouses]] of the period. [[Conversation]] was supposed to conform to a particular manner, with the language of polite and civil conversation considered to be essential to the conduct of coffeehouse debate and conversation.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, 1996 p 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3133532 "Politeness and the Interpretation of the British Eighteenth Century"], Lawrence E. Klein, ''[[The Historical Journal]]'', Vol. 45, No. 4 (Dec., 2002), pp. 869-898.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of '[[civility]]' referred to a desired social interaction which valued sober and reasoned debate on matters of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, 2005. p 101&lt;/ref&gt; Established rules and procedures for proper behaviour as well as conventions, were outlined by [[gentleman's club]]s, such as Harrington's Rota Club. Periodicals, including ''[[Tatler (1709)|The Tatler]]'' and ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'', infused politeness into English coffeehouse conversation, as their explicit purpose lay in the reformation of English manners and morals.&lt;ref name="Mackie, 1998. p 1"&gt;Mackie, 1998. p 1&lt;/ref&gt;

** affective tags indicate concern for the listener. "You haven't been here long, have you?" 
*** softeners reduce the force of what would be a brusque demand. "Hand me that thing, could you?"
*** facilitative tags invite the addressee to comment on the request being made. "You can do that, can't you?"

Some studies&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, R. (1975) ''Language and Woman's Place''. New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beeching, K. (2002) ''Gender, Politeness and Pragmatic Particles in French''. Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that women are more likely to use politeness formulas than men, though the exact differences are not clear. Most current research has shown that gender differences in politeness use are complex,&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, J. 1995 Women Men and Language, Longman; Mills, Gender and Politeness, Cambridge University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; since there is a clear association between politeness norms and the stereotypical speech of middle class white women, at least in the UK and US. It is therefore unsurprising that women tend to be associated with politeness more and their linguistic behaviour judged in relation to these politeness norms.

==Linguistic devices==
Besides and additionally to the above, many languages have specific means to show politeness, deference, respect, or a recognition of the social status of the speaker and the hearer. There are two main ways in which a given language shows politeness: in its [[lexicon]] (for example, employing certain words in formal occasions, and colloquial forms in informal contexts), and in its [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (for example, using special verb forms for polite discourse). The [[T-V distinction]] is a common example in Western languages.

==Criticism of the theory==
Brown and Levinson's theory of politeness has been criticised as not being universally valid, by linguists working with [[East Asian languages|East-Asian languages]], including Japanese. Matsumoto&lt;ref&gt;Matsumoto, Y. (1988) "Reexamination of the universality of Face: Politeness phenomena in Japanese". Journal of Pragmatics 12: 403–426.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ide&lt;ref&gt;Ide, S. (1989) "Formal forms and discernment: two neglected aspects of universals of linguistic politeness". Multilingua 8(2/3): 223–248.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that Brown and Levinson assume the speaker's volitional use of language, which allows the speaker's creative use of face-maintaining strategies toward the addressee. In East-Asian cultures like Japan, politeness is achieved not so much on the basis of volition as on discernment (''wakimae'', finding one's place), or prescribed [[social norms]]. ''Wakimae'' is oriented towards the need for acknowledgment of the positions or roles of all the participants as well as adherence to formality norms appropriate to the particular situation.

[[Japanese language|Japanese]] is perhaps the most widely known example of a language that encodes politeness at its very core. Japanese has two main levels of politeness, one for intimate acquaintances, family and friends, and one for other groups, and verb morphology reflects these levels. Besides that, some verbs have special hyper-polite [[suppletion|suppletive]] forms. This happens also with some nouns and interrogative pronouns. Japanese also employs different personal pronouns for each person according to gender, age, rank, degree of acquaintance, and other cultural factors. See [[Honorific speech in Japanese]], for further information.

In [[philosophy]], '''potentiality and actuality'''&lt;ref&gt;''dynamis&amp;ndash;energeia'', translated into Latin as ''potentia&amp;ndash;actualitas'' (earlier also ''possibilitas&amp;ndash;efficacia''). Giorgio Agamben, ''Opus Dei: An Archaeology of Duty'' (2013), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=yVYTAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46  p. 46].&lt;/ref&gt; are a pair of closely connected principles which [[Aristotle]] used to analyze [[Motion (physics)|motion]], [[Four causes|causality]], [[Aristotelian ethics|ethics]], and [[physiology]] in his ''[[Aristotelian physics|Physics]]'', ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and ''[[De Anima]]'', which is about the human [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]].&lt;ref name="Sachs2005"/&gt;

The concept of potentiality, in this context, generally refers to any "possibility" that a thing can be said to have. Aristotle did not consider all possibilities the same, and emphasized the importance of those that become real of their own accord when conditions are right and nothing stops them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Sachs|1999|p=lvii}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Actuality, in contrast to potentiality, is the motion, change or activity that represents an exercise or fulfillment of a possibility, when a possibility becomes real in the fullest sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Durrant|1993|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These concepts, in modified forms, remained very important into the [[middle ages]], influencing the development of [[medieval theology]] in several ways. Going further into modern times, while the understanding of [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]], and according to some interpretations [[deity]], implied by the dichotomy lost importance, the terminology has found new uses, developing indirectly from the old. This is most obvious in words like "energy" and "dynamic"--words first used in modern physics by the German scientist and philosopher, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].   Another example is the highly controversial biological concept of an "[[Potentiality and actuality#Entelecheia in modern philosophy and biology|entelechy]]".

==Potentiality==
'''Potentiality''' and '''potency''' are translations of the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''dunamis'' ([[wikt:δύναμις|δύναμις]]) as it is used by Aristotle as a concept contrasting with actuality. Its [[Latin]] translation is "''[[wikt:potentia|potentia]]''", root of the English word potential, and used by some scholars instead of the Greek or English variants.

''Dunamis'' is an ordinary Greek word for possibility or capability. Depending on context, it could be translated "potency", "potential", "capacity", "ability", "power", "capability", "strength", "possibility", "force" and is the root of modern [[English language|English]] words "dynamic", "dynamite", and "dynamo".&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=dunamis&amp;la=greek&amp;prior= Perseus dictionary references] for ''dunamis''.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[early modern]] philosophy, English authors like [[Hobbes]] and [[John Locke|Locke]] used the English word "power" as their translation of Latin ''potentia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Locke|1689|loc=chpt. XXI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his philosophy, Aristotle distinguished two meanings of the word ''dunamis''. According to his understanding of [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] there was both a weak sense of potential, meaning simply that something "might chance to happen or not to happen", and a stronger sense, to indicate how something could be done ''well''. For example, "sometimes we say that those who can merely take a walk, or speak, without doing it as well as they intended, cannot speak or walk". This stronger sense is mainly said of the potentials of living things, although it is also sometimes used for things like musical instruments.&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D5%3Asection%3D1019a 1019a] - [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D5%3Asection%3D1019b 1019b]. The translations used are those of Tredennick on the [[Perseus project]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his works, Aristotle clearly distinguishes things that are stable or persistent, with their own strong natural tendency to a specific type of change, from things that appear to occur by chance. He treats these as having a different and more real existence. "[[Nature (philosophy)|Natures]] which persist" are said by him to be one of the causes of all things, while natures that do not persist, "might often be slandered as not being at all by one who fixes his thinking sternly upon it as upon a criminal". The potencies which persist in a particular material are one way of describing "the nature itself" of that material, an innate source of motion and rest within that material. In terms of Aristotle's theory of [[four causes]], a material's non-accidental potential, is the material cause of the things that can come to be from that material, and one part of how we can understand the [[substance theory|substance]] (''[[ousia]]'', sometimes translated as "thinghood") of any separate thing. (As emphasized by Aristotle, this requires his distinction between [[Accident (philosophy)|accidental]] causes and natural causes.)&lt;ref&gt;From ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' 192a18. Translation from {{Harvtxt|Sachs|1995|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle, when we refer to the nature of a thing, we are referring to the form, shape or look of a thing, which was already present as a potential, an innate tendency to change, in that material before it achieved that form, but things show what they are more fully, as a real thing, when they are "fully at work".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' 193b. ({{Harvtxt|Sachs|1995|p=51}}.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actuality==
'''Actuality''' is often used to translate both ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=e%29nerge%2Fw&amp;la=greek&amp;prior=e%29nerga/zomai energeia]'' ([[wikt:ενέργεια|ενέργεια]]) and ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=e%29ntele%2Fxeia&amp;la=greek&amp;prior=e%29ntele/w#lexicon entelecheia]'' ([[wikt:ἐντελέχεια|ἐντελέχεια]]) (sometimes rendered in English as ''"[[wikt:entelechy|entelechy]]"''). "Actuality" comes from Latin ''{{linktext|actualitas}}'' and is a traditional translation, but its normal meaning in Latin is "anything which is currently happening".

The two words ''energeia'' and ''entelecheia'' were coined by Aristotle, and he stated that their meanings were intended to converge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1047a Metaphysics 1047a30], in the {{Harvtxt|Sachs|1999}} translation: "the phrase being-at-work, which is designed to converge in meaning with being-at-work-staying-complete". [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.+Met.+9.1047a&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051 Greek is]: ἐλήλυθε δ᾽ ἡ '''ἐνέργεια''' τοὔνομα, ἡ πρὸς τὴν '''ἐντελέχειαν''' συντιθεμένη&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, most commentators and translators consider the two words to be interchangeable.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw 2004"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bradshaw|2004}} page 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Durrant|1993|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; They both refer to something being in its own type of action or at work, as all things are when they are real in the fullest sense, and not just potentially real. For example, "to be a rock is to strain to be at the center of the universe, and thus to be in motion unless constrained otherwise".&lt;ref name=Sachs2005/&gt;

===Energeia===
''Energeia'' is a word based upon ἔργον (''ergon''), meaning "work".&lt;ref name="Bradshaw 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.+Met.+9.1050a&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052 Metaphysics 1050a21-23]. In Tredinnick's translation: "For the activity is the end, and the actuality (''energeia'') is the activity (''ergon''); hence the term "actuality" is derived from "activity," and tends to have the meaning of "complete reality (''entelecheia'')." [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1050a Greek:] τὸ γὰρ ἔργον τέλος, ἡ δὲ ἐνέργεια τὸ ἔργον, διὸ καὶ τοὔνομα ἐνέργεια λέγεται κατὰ τὸ ἔργον καὶ συντείνει πρὸς τὴν ἐντελέχειαν.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the source of the modern word "[[energy]]" but the term has evolved so much over the course of the [[history of science]] that  reference to the modern term is not very helpful in understanding the original as used by Aristotle. It is difficult to translate his use of ''energeia'' into English with consistency. Joe Sachs renders it with the phrase "being–at–work" and says that "we might construct the word is-at-work-ness from Anglo-Saxon roots to translate ''energeia'' into English".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Sachs|1995}}, {{Harvtxt|Sachs|1999}}, {{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle says the word can be made clear by looking at examples rather than trying to find a definition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1048a Metaphysics 1048a30ff].&lt;/ref&gt;

Two examples of ''energeiai'' in Aristotle's works are [[pleasure]] and [[happiness]] ([[eudaimonia]]). Pleasure is an ''energeia'' of the human body and mind whereas happiness is more simply the ''energeia'' of a human being a human.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', [[Nicomachean Ethics#Book X. Chapters 1–5: The theory of Pleasure|Book X. Chapters 1–5]].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kinesis'', translated as [[Motion (physics)|movement]], [[motion (physics)|motion]], or in some contexts change, is also explained by Aristotle as a particular type of ''energeia''. See below.

===Entelechy or entelechia===
Entelechy, in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''entelécheia'', was coined by Aristotle and transliterated in [[Latin]] as ''{{linktext|entelechia}}''. According to {{Harvtxt|Sachs|1995|p=245}}:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aristotle invents the word by combining ''entelēs'' (ἐντελής, "complete, full-grown") with ''echein'' (&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''[[hexis]]'', to be a certain way by the continuing effort of holding on in that condition), while at the same time punning on ''endelecheia'' (ἐνδελέχεια, "persistence") by inserting "[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]" (τέλος, "completion"). This is a three-ring circus of a word, at the heart of everything in Aristotle's thinking, including the definition of motion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sachs therefore proposed a complex neologism of his own, "being-at-work-staying-the-same".&lt;ref name=Sachs1995/&gt; Another translation in recent years is "being-at-an-end" (which Sachs has also used).&lt;ref name=Sachs2005&gt;{{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Entelecheia'', as can be seen by its derivation, is a kind of completeness, whereas "the end and completion of any genuine being is its being-at-work" (''energeia''). The ''entelecheia'' is a continuous being-at-work (''energeia'') when something is doing its complete "work". For this reason, the meanings of the two words converge, and they both depend upon the idea that every thing's "thinghood" is a kind of work, or in other words a specific way of being in motion. All things that exist now, and not just potentially, are beings-at-work, and all of them have a tendency towards being-at-work in a particular way that would be their proper and "complete" way.&lt;ref name=Sachs1995&gt;{{Harvtxt|Sachs|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sachs explains the convergence of ''energeia'' and ''entelecheia'' as follows, and uses the word actuality to describe the overlap between them:&lt;ref name=Sachs2005/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Just as ''energeia'' extends to ''entelecheia'' because it is the activity which makes a thing what it is, ''entelecheia'' extends to ''energeia'' because it is the end or perfection which has being only in, through, and during activity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Motion==

Aristotle discusses motion (''kinēsis'') in his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' quite differently from [[modern science]]. Aristotle's definition of motion is closely connected to his actuality-potentiality distinction. Taken literally, Aristotle defines motion as the actuality (''entelecheia'') of a "potentiality as such".&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' 201a10-11, 201a27-29, 201b4-5. ''Metaphysics'' Book VII.&lt;/ref&gt; What Aristotle meant however is the subject of several different interpretations. A major difficulty comes from the fact that the terms actuality and potentiality, linked in this definition, are normally understood within Aristotle as opposed to each other. On the other hand, the "as such" is important and is explained at length by Aristotle, giving examples of "potentiality as such". For example, the motion of building is the ''energeia'' of the ''dunamis'' of the building materials ''as building materials'' as opposed to anything else they might become, and this potential in the unbuilt materials is referred to by Aristotle as "the buildable". So the motion of building is the actualization of "the buildable" and not the actualization of a house as such, nor the actualization of any other possibility which the building materials might have had.&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' Book XI, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D11%3Asection%3D1066a 1066a].&lt;/ref&gt;

In an influential 1969 paper Aryeh Kosman divided up previous attempts to explain Aristotle's definition into two types, criticised them, and then gave his own third interpretation. While this has not become a consensus, it has been described as having become "orthodox".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09tRfDqEo4MC&amp;pg=PA8|title=Oxford Physics in the Thirteenth Century (ca. 1250-1270): Motion, Infinity, Place &amp; Time| first=Cecilia |year=2000|publisher=Brill|last=Trifogli|page=8|isbn=9004116575}}&lt;/ref&gt; This and similar more recent publications are the basis of the following summary.

===1. The "process" interpretation===
{{Harvcoltxt|Kosman|1969}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Coope|2009}} associate this approach with [[W.D. Ross]]. {{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}} points out that it was also the interpretation of [[Averroes]] and [[Maimonides]].

This interpretation is, to use the words of Ross that "it is the passage to actuality that is ''kinesis''” as opposed to any potentiality being an actuality.&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'', text with commentary, London, 1936, p. 359, quoted by {{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument of Ross for this interpretation requires him to assert that Aristotle actually used his own word ''entelecheia'' wrongly, or inconsistently, only within his definition, making it mean "actualization", which is in conflict with Aristotle's normal use of words. According to {{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}} this explanation also can not account for the "as such" in Aristotle's definition.

===2. The "product" interpretation===
{{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}} associates this interpretation with [[St Thomas of Aquinas]] and explains that by this explanation "the apparent contradiction between potentiality and actuality in Aristotle’s definition of motion" is resolved "by arguing that in every motion actuality and potentiality are mixed or blended". Motion is therefore "the actuality of any potentiality insofar as it is still a potentiality". Or in other words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Thomistic blend of actuality and potentiality has the characteristic that, to the extent that it is actual it is not potential and to the extent that it is potential it is not actual; the hotter the water is, the less is it potentially hot, and the cooler it is, the less is it actually, the more potentially, hot.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As with the first interpretation however, {{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}} objects that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One implication of this interpretation is that whatever happens to be the case right now is an ''entelechia'', as though something that is intrinsically unstable as the instantaneous position of an arrow in flight deserved to be described by the word that everywhere else Aristotle reserves for complex organized states that persist, that hold out against internal and external causes that try to destroy them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a more recent paper on this subject, Kosman associates the view of Aquinas with those of his own critics, David Charles, Jonathan Beere, and Robert Heineman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kosman|2013}}, chapter 2, footnote 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===3. The interpretation of Kosman, Coope, Sachs and others===

{{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}}, amongst other authors (such as Aryeh Kosman and Ursula Coope), proposes that the solution to problems interpreting Aristotle's definition must be found in the distinction Aristotle makes between two different types of potentiality, with only one of those corresponding to the "potentiality as such" appearing in the definition of motion. He writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The man with sight, but with his eyes closed, differs from the blind man, although neither is seeing. The first man has the capacity to see, which the second man lacks. There are then potentialities as well as actualities in the world. But when the first man opens his eyes, has he lost the capacity to see? Obviously not; while he is seeing, his capacity to see is no longer merely a potentiality, but is a potentiality which has been put to work. The potentiality to see exists sometimes as active or at-work, and sometimes as inactive or latent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coming to motion, Sachs gives the example of a man walking across the room and says that...
*"Once he has reached the other side of the room, his potentiality to be there has been actualized in Ross’ sense of the term". This is a type of ''energeia''. However it is not a motion, and not relevant to the definition of motion.
*''While'' a man is walking his potentiality to be on the other side of the room is actual ''just as a potentiality'', or in other words the potential ''as such'' is an actuality. "The actuality of the potentiality to be on the other side of the room, as just that potentiality, is neither more nor less than the walking across the room."

{{Harvtxt|Sachs|1995|pp=78–79}}, in his commentary of Aristotle's ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' book III gives the following results from his understanding of Aristotle's definition of motion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The genus of which motion is a species is being-at-work-staying-itself (''entelecheia''), of which the only other species is thinghood. The being-at-work-staying-itself of a potency (''dunamis''), as material, is thinghood. The being-at-work-staying-the-same of a potency as a potency is motion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The importance of actuality in Aristotle's philosophy==
The actuality-potentiality distinction in Aristotle is a key element linked to everything in his physics and metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sachs|1995|p=245}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Carrara 7.JPG|250px|right|thumb|A [[marble]] block in [[Carrara]]. Could there be a particular sculpture already existing in it as a potentiality? Aristotle wrote approvingly of such ways of talking, and felt it reflected a type of causation in nature which is often ignored in scientific discussion.]]
Aristotle describes potentiality and actuality, or potency and action, as one of several distinctions between things that exist or do not exist. In a sense, a thing that exists potentially does not exist, but the potential does exist. And this type of distinction is expressed for several different types of being within Aristotle's categories of being. For example, from Aristotle's ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D5%3Asection%3D1017a 1017a]:&lt;ref&gt;Tredennick's translation, with links to his footnote cross references, using the [[Perseus project|Perseus]] online resources: "For we say that both that which sees potentially and that which sees actually is "a seeing thing." And in the same way we call "understanding" both that which can use the understanding, and that which does ; and we call "tranquil" both that in which tranquillity is already present, and that which is potentially tranquil. Similarly too in the case of substances. For we say that Hermes is in the stone, (Cf. Aristotle ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.%20Met.%203.1002a&amp;lang=original Met. 3.5.6.]'') and the half of the line in the whole; and we call "corn" what is not yet ripe. But when a thing is potentially existent and when not, must be defined elsewhere." Aristotle ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.%20Met.%209.1051a&amp;lang=original Metaphysics 9.9.]''&lt;/ref&gt;
*We speak of an entity being a "seeing" thing whether it is currently seeing or just able to see.
*We speak of someone having understanding, whether they are using that understanding or not.
*We speak of corn existing in a field even when it is not yet ripe.
*People sometimes speak of a figure being already present in a rock which could be sculpted to represent that figure.

Within the works of Aristotle the terms ''energeia'' and ''entelecheia'', often translated as actuality, differ from what is merely actual because they specifically presuppose that all things have a proper kind of activity or work which, if achieved, would be their proper end. Greek for end in this sense is [[telos (philosophy)|telos]], a component word in ''entelecheia'' (a work that is the proper end of a thing) and also [[teleology]]. This is an aspect of Aristotle's [[Four causes|theory of four causes]] and specifically of formal cause (''eidos'', which Aristotle says is ''energeia''&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1050b 1050b]. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1050b Greek:] ὥστε φανερὸν ὅτι ἡ οὐσία καὶ τὸ εἶδος ἐνέργειά ἐστιν.&lt;/ref&gt;) and final cause (''telos'').

In essence this means that Aristotle did not see things as matter in motion only, but also proposed that all things have their own aims or ends. In other words, for Aristotle (unlike modern science) there is a distinction between things with a natural cause in the strongest sense, and things that truly happen by accident. He also distinguishes non-rational from rational potentialities (e.g. the capacity to heat and the capacity to play the flute, respectively), pointing out that the latter require desire or deliberate choice for their actualization.&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1048a 1048a]. The Greek words are ''orexis'' for desire and ''proairesis'' for deliberate choice.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this style of reasoning, Aristotle is often referred to as having a [[teleology]], and sometimes as having a [[theory of forms]].

While actuality is linked by Aristotle to his concept of a [[formal cause]], potentiality (or potency) on the other hand, is linked by Aristotle to his concepts of [[Hylomorphism|hylomorphic matter]] and [[material cause]]. Aristotle wrote for example that "matter exists potentially, because it may attain to the form; but when it exists actually, it is then in the form".&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1050a 1050a15]. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1050a Greek:] ἔτι ἡ ὕλη ἔστι δυνάμει ὅτι ἔλθοι ἂν εἰς τὸ εἶδος: ὅταν δέ γε ἐνεργείᾳ ᾖ, τότε ἐν τῷ εἴδει ἐστίν&lt;/ref&gt;

==The active intellect==
{{Main article|Active Intellect}}
The active intellect was a concept Aristotle described that requires an understanding of the actuality-potentiality dichotomy. Aristotle described this in his ''[[On the Soul|De Anima]]'' (book 3, ch. 5, 430a10-25) and covered similar ground in his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' (book 12, ch.7-10). The following is from the ''De Anima'', translated by Joe Sachs,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sachs|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some parenthetic notes about the Greek. The passage tries to explain "how the human intellect passes from its original state, in which it does not think, to a subsequent state, in which it does." He inferred that the energeia/dunamis distinction must also exist in the soul itself:&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt;-
&lt;blockquote&gt;...since in [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] one thing is the material [''[[matter|hulē]]''] for each kind [''[[genos]]''] (this is what is in '''potency''' all the particular things of that kind) but it is something else that is the causal and productive thing by which all of them are formed, as is the case with an art in relation to its material, it is necessary in the soul [''[[psyche (psychology)|psuchē]]''] too that these distinct aspects be present;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;the one sort is intellect [''[[nous]]''] by becoming all things, the other sort by forming all things, in the way an active condition [''[[hexis]]''] like [[light]] too makes the colors '''that are in potency be at work as''' colors [''to phōs poiei ta '''dunamei''' onta chrōmata '''energeiai''' chrōmata''].&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This sort of intellect is separate, as well as being without attributes and unmixed, since it is by its thinghood a '''[[being-at-work]]''', for what acts is always distinguished in stature above what is acted upon, as a governing source is above the material it works on.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Knowledge]] [''epistēmē''], in its '''being-at-work''', is the same as the thing it knows, and while knowledge in '''potency''' comes first in time in any one knower, in the whole of things it does not take precedence even in time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This does not mean that at one time it thinks but at another time it does not think, but when separated it is just exactly what it is, and this alone is deathless and everlasting (though we have no memory, because this sort of intellect is not acted upon, while the sort that is acted upon is destructible), and without this nothing thinks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This has been referred to as one of "the most intensely studied sentences in the history of philosophy".&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{harvtxt|Davidson|1992|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Metaphysics'', Aristotle wrote at more length on a similar subject and is often understood to have equated the active intellect with being the "[[unmoved mover]]" and [[God]]. Nevertheless, as Davidson remarks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Just what Aristotle meant by potential intellect and active intellect - terms not even explicit in the ''De anima'' and at best implied - and just how he understood the interaction between them remains [[wikt:moot|moot]] to this day. Students of the history of philosophy continue to debate Aristotle's intent, particularly the question whether he considered the active intellect to be an aspect of the human soul or an entity existing independently of man.&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Post-Aristotelian usage==

===New meanings of ''energeia'' or energy===

Already in Aristotle's own works, the concept of a distinction between ''energeia'' and ''dunamis'' was used in many ways, for example to describe the way striking metaphors work,&lt;ref&gt;[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.+Rh.+1411b&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0060 1411b]&lt;/ref&gt; or human happiness. [[Polybius]] about 150 BC, in his work the ''Histories'' uses Aristotle's word ''energeia'' in both an Aristotelian way and also to describe the "clarity and vividness" of things.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bradshaw|2004|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus Siculus]] in 60-30 BC used the term in a very similar way to Polybius. However Diodorus uses the term to denote qualities unique to individuals. Using the term in ways that could translated as "vigor" or "[[energy]]" (in a more modern sense); for society, "practice" or "custom"; for a thing, "operation" or "working"; like vigor in action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bradshaw|2004|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoplatonism===
[[Plotinus]] was a late classical pagan philosopher and theologian whose [[monotheism|monotheistic]] re-workings of Plato and Aristotle were influential amongst early Christian theologians. In his ''[[Enneads]]'' he sought to reconcile ideas of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]] together with a form of [[monotheism]], that used three fundamental metaphysical principles, which were conceived of in terms consistent with Aristotle's energeia/dunamis dichotomy, and one interpretation of his concept of the Active Intellect (discussed above):-
*The [[Monism|Monad]] or "the One" sometimes also described as "[[the Good]]". This is the ''dunamis'' or possibility of existence.
*The Intellect, or Intelligence, or, to use the Greek term, ''[[Nous]]'', which is described as God, or a ''[[Demiurge]]''. It thinks its own contents, which are thoughts, equated to the Platonic ideas or [[Theory of Forms|forms]] (''eide''). The thinking of this Intellect is the highest ''activity'' of life. The ''actualization'' of this thinking is the being of the forms. This Intellect is the first principle or foundation of existence. The One is prior to it, but not in the sense that a normal cause is prior to an effect, but instead Intellect is called an [[emanation]] of the One. The One is the possibility of this foundation of existence.
*[[Soul]] or, to use the Greek term, ''[[psyche (psychology)|psyche]]''. The soul is also an ''energeia'': it acts upon or ''actualizes'' its own thoughts and creates "a separate, material cosmos that is the living image of the spiritual or noetic [[Cosmos]] contained as a unified thought within the Intelligence".
This was based largely upon Plotinus' reading of Plato, but also incorporated many Aristotelian concepts, including the [[Unmoved Mover]] as ''energeia''.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Citation|chapter=Plotinus|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/plotinus/|last=Moore|first=Edward}} and {{Citation|chapter=Plotinus|title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plotinus/|last=Gerson|first=Lloyd}}. The direct quote above comes from Moore.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Essence-energies debate in medieval Christian theology===
{{details|Essence-Energies distinction}}

In [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christianity, St [[Gregory Palamas]] wrote about the "energies" (actualities; singular ''energeia'' in Greek, or ''actus'' in Latin) of God in contrast to God's "[[essence]]" (''ousia''). These are two distinct types of existence, with God's energy being the type of existence which people can perceive, while the essence of God is outside of normal existence or non-existence or human understanding, in that it is not caused or created by anything else.

Palamas gave this explanation as part of his defense of the Eastern Orthodox [[asceticism|ascetic]] practice of [[hesychasm]]. Palamism became a standard part of Orthodox dogma after 1351.&lt;ref name=HistoricalOverview&gt;{{cite web |title=Gregory Palamas: An Historical Overview |url=http://www.monachos.net/content/patristics/studies-fathers/61-gregory-palamas-an-historical-overview?title=Gregory_Palamas:_An_Historical_Overview |accessdate=2010-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927014640/http://www.monachos.net/content/patristics/studies-fathers/61-gregory-palamas-an-historical-overview?title=Gregory_Palamas%3A_An_Historical_Overview |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the position of Western Medieval (or Catholic) Christianity, can be found for example in the philosophy of [[Thomas Aquinas]], who relied on Aristotle's concept of entelechy, when he defined God as ''actus purus'', [[pure act]], actuality unmixed with potentiality. The existence of a truly distinct essence of God which is not actuality, is not generally accepted in Catholic Theology.

===Influence on modal logic===

The notion of possibility was greatly analyzed by medieval and modern philosophers. Aristotle's logical work in this area is considered by some to be an anticipation of [[Modal logic#Development of modal logic|modal logic]] and its treatment of potentiality and time. Indeed, many philosophical interpretations of possibility are related to a famous passage on Aristotle's ''[[On Interpretation]]'', concerning the truth of the statement: "There will be a sea battle tomorrow".&lt;ref&gt;See [https://archive.org/stream/AristotleOrganon/AristotleOrganoncollectedWorks#page/n57/mode/1up/search/sea-fight copy] of W.D. Ross's translation scanned on Internet Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Contemporary philosophy]] regards possibility, as studied by [[Modal logic#Metaphysical possibility|modal metaphysics]], to be an aspect of [[modal logic]]. Modal logic as a named subject owes much to the writings of the [[Scholastics]], in particular [[William of Ockham]] and [[John Duns Scotus]], who reasoned informally in a modal manner, mainly to analyze statements about [[essence]] and [[accident (philosophy)|accident]].

===Influence on modern physics===

Aristotle's metaphysics, his account of nature and causality, was for the most part rejected by the [[early modern]] philosophers. [[Francis Bacon]] in his ''[[Novum Organon]]'' in one explanation of the case for rejecting the concept of a formal cause or "nature" for each type of thing, argued for example that philosophers must still look for formal causes but only in the sense of "simple natures" such as [[colour]], and [[weight]], which exist in many gradations and modes in very different types of individual bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Book II, aphorism V&lt;/ref&gt; In the works of [[Thomas Hobbes]] then, the traditional Aristotelian terms, "''potentia et actus''", are discussed, but he equates them simply to "cause and effect".&lt;ref&gt;''[[De Corpore]]'' chapter X (in [https://archive.org/stream/thomhobbesmalme03molegoog#page/n261/mode/1up Latin]; in [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gr8LAAAAIAAJ&amp;vq=power&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q=chapter%20X&amp;f=false English]).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz]], the source of the modern adaptations of Aristotle's concepts of potentiality and actuality.]]

There was an adaptation of at least one aspect of Aristotle's potentiality and actuality distinction, which has become part of modern physics, although as per Bacon's approach it is a generalized form of energy, not one connected to specific forms for specific things. The definition of [[energy]] in modern [[physics]] as the [[Product (mathematics)|product]] of [[mass]] and the [[Square (algebra)|square]] of [[velocity]], was derived by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], as a correction of [[Descartes]], based upon [[Galileo]]'s investigation of falling bodies. He preferred to refer to it as an ''entelecheia'' or "living force" (Latin ''vis viva''), but what he defined is today called "kinetic energy", and was seen by Leibniz as a modification of Aristotle's ''energeia'', and his concept of the potential for movement which is in things. Instead of each type of physical thing having its own specific tendency to a way of moving or changing, as in Aristotle, Leibniz said that instead, force, power, or motion itself could be transferred between things of different types, in such a way that there is a general [[Conservation of energy|conservation of this energy]]. In other words, Leibniz's modern version of entelechy or energy obeys its own laws of nature, whereas different types of things do not have their own separate laws of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Klein|1985}}, and {{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}}: "[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], who criticized [[Descartes]]’ physics and invented a science of dynamics, explicitly acknowledged his debt to Aristotle (see, e.g., ''Specimen Dynamicum''), whose doctrine of ''entelecheia'' he regarded himself as restoring in a modified form. From Leibniz we derive our current notions of [[potential]] and [[kinetic energy]], whose very names, pointing to the actuality which is potential and the actuality which is motion, preserve the [[Thomism|Thomistic]] resolutions of the two paradoxes in Aristotle’s definition of motion."&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Leibniz|1890|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;...the entelechy of Aristotle, which has made so much noise, is nothing else but force or activity ; that is, a state from which action naturally flows if nothing hinders it. But matter, primary and pure, taken without the souls or lives which are united to it, is purely passive ; properly speaking also it is not a substance, but something incomplete.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Leibniz's study of the "entelechy" now known as energy was a part of what he called his new science of "dynamics", based on the Greek word ''dunamis'' and his understanding that he was making a modern version of Aristotle's old dichotomy. He also referred to it as the "new science of power and action", (Latin "''potentia et effectu''" and "''potentia et actione''"). And it is from him that the modern distinction between [[statics]] and dynamics in physics stems. The emphasis on ''dunamis'' in the name of this new science comes from the importance of his discovery of [[potential energy]] which is not active, but which conserves energy nevertheless. "As 'a science of power and action', dynamics arises when Leibniz proposes an adequate architectonic of laws for constrained, as well as unconstrained, motions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Duchesneau|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Leibniz, like Aristotle, this law of nature concerning entelechies was also understood as a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical law]], important not only for [[physics]], but also for understanding [[life]] and the [[soul]]. A soul, or spirit, according to Leibniz, can be understood as a type of entelechy (or living [[Monadology|monad]]) which has distinct [[perception]]s and memory.

===Entelecheia in modern philosophy and biology===

As discussed above, terms derived from ''dunamis'' and ''energeia'' have become parts of modern scientific vocabulary with a very different meaning from Aristotle's. The original meanings are not used by modern philosophers unless they are commenting on classical or medieval philosophy. In contrast, ''entelecheia'', in the form of "entelechy" is a word used much less in technical senses in recent times.

As mentioned above, the concept had occupied a central position in the metaphysics of Leibniz, and is closely related to his [[Monadology|monad]] in the sense that each sentient entity contains its own entire universe within it. But Leibniz' use of this concept influenced more than just the development of the vocabulary of modern physics. Leibniz was also one of the main inspirations for the important movement in philosophy known as [[German Idealism]], and within this movement and schools influenced by it entelechy may denote a force propelling one to [[self-fulfillment]].

In the biological [[vitalism]] of [[Hans Driesch]], living things develop by ''entelechy'', a common purposive and organising field. Leading vitalists like Driesch argued that many of the basic problems of biology cannot be solved by a philosophy in which the organism is simply considered a machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mayr|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitalism and its concepts like entelechy have since been discarded as without value for scientific practice by the overwhelming majority of professional biologists. 

However, in philosophy aspects and applications of the concept of entelechy have been explored by scientifically interested philosophers and philosophically inclined scientists alike. One example was the American critic and philosopher [[Kenneth Burke]] (1897–1993) whose concept of the "[[terministic screens]]" illustrates his thought on the subject. Most prominent was perhaps the German quantum physicist [[Werner Heisenberg]]. He looked to the notions of potentiality and actuality in order to better understand the relationship of quantum theory to the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/375/2106/20160390?Type=ALERT See Jaeger]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7260">The '''purple economy''' is that part of the [[economy]] which contributes to [[sustainable development]] by promoting the cultural potential of goods and services.

“The purple economy refers to taking account of cultural aspects in economics. It designates an economy that adapts to the human diversity in globalization and that relies on the cultural dimension to give value to goods and services.”&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.lejournaldesarts.fr/jda/archives/docs_article/89661/lactualite-vue-par-jerome-gouadain-promoteur-du-concept-d---economie-mauve---.php Le Journal des Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; These two trends, one vertical and one horizontal, feed one another. In fact the growth in the cultural component attached to products is linked to each territory’s cultural vitality.

== Surge in culture ==
The context of the purple economy is that of the growing importance of culture in contemporary society. The factors involved in this include in particular:&lt;ref name=diversum20170630&gt;Diversum, Gilles Andrier, Loïc Armand, Francesco Bandarin, Jérôme Bédier, Françoise Benhamou, Fouad Benseddik, Gilles Boëtsch, [[Dominique Bourg]], Jérôme Gouadain, Maria Gravari-Barbas, Marc-Antoine Jamet, [[François Jullien]], [[Pascal Lamy]], [[Jacques Lévy]], [[Gilles Lipovetsky]], Françoise Montenay, Jean Musitelli, Patrick O’Quin, Philippe d’Ornano, [[Dominique Perrault]], Marie-Hélène Plainfossé, Nicole Rouvet, [http://diversum.net/fr/association/a.php?t=document-de-reference&amp;id=74presse| “The Cultural Footprint of the Cosmetic Sector”] (accessed 22 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; a global economic and political readjustment in favour of emerging countries, a return to local environments (once again perceived as centres for stability), new forms of claims (following on from the collapse of the great ideologies), growing social demand for quality based on cultural consumption patterns (which go hand in hand with the logic of popularization, individualization and longer life expectancies), innovative approaches (that presuppose a cultural state of mind and interdisciplinarity conducive to [[serendipity]]), and so on.

== Scope ==
The purple economy is multidisciplinary, in that it enriches all goods and services by capitalizing on the cultural dimension inherent to every sector. The sensory, experiential economy is one application of this.&lt;ref name=diversum20170630/&gt;

It differs from the [[Economics of the arts and literature|cultural economy]], which is sector-based.

In June 2013, the conclusions of a first inter-institutional working group on the purple economy, formed of experts from [[UNESCO]], the [[OECD]], the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|International Organisation of the Francophonie]], French ministries, various companies and civil society. That document underscored the impact of the phenomenon of culturalization, which now affects the entire economy, with follow-on effects on employment and training. The report differentiates between ''purple jobs'' and ''purplifying professions'': the former are directly linked to the cultural environment by their very purpose (like town planners and developers), while the latter are merely caused to transform under the effect of culturalization (such as positions in human resources or in marketing and communications).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diversum.net/fichiers/File/The%20purple%20economy,%20an%20objective,%20an%20opportunity.pdf Conclusions of the first inter-institutional working group on the purple economy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reference document published in June 2017&lt;ref name=diversum20170630/&gt; mentioned various aspects of the human environment in which economics are likely to produce cultural benefits: architecture, art, colours, enjoyment, ethics, heritage, imagination, learning, social skills, singularity, etc.

== Origin ==
The term first appeared in 2011, in France, in a manifest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2011/05/19/l-economie-mauve-une-nouvelle-alliance-entre-culture-et-economie_1524674_3232.html Le Monde.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; published on [[Le Monde|Le Monde.fr]].

== Connection to sustainable development ==
[[File:Sustainable economy.gif|thumb|The three components of a sustainable economy]]

The purple economy emphasizes the presence of [[externalities]]: the cultural environment from which agents draw and on which, in return, they leave their own footprints is a [[common good]]. As a result, the purple economy sees culture as an axis for [[sustainable development]].

In fact, culture has been a whole sub-section of sustainability since the beginning. [[Corporate social responsibility]] can even be said to have originated in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] adopted by the United Nations in 1966.

This issue is just one of the different components of [[sustainable development]], alongside concerns relating to the [[natural environment]] ([[green economy]]) and to the [[social environment]] ([[social economy]]). The complementary nature of these aspects of the sustainable economy was reaffirmed in a call&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2015/06/30/la-reponse-au-rechauffement-est-aussi-culturelle_4664807_3232.html Le Monde Économie]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;By: [[Pierre Bellon]], Véronique Cayla, [[Bertrand P.

Its mission is to “[protect] the integrity and economy of the State of Qatar through effective exchange of information, transparency enhancement and capacity building to help detect and deter money laundering and terrorism financing activities.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The QFIU is a “semiautonomous component” of Qatar’s National Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing Committee (NAMLC), and is housed in the Qatar Central Bank.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/mer/MER%20Qatar.pdf|title = Mutual Evaluation Report: Anti‐Money Laundering and   Combating the Financing of Terrorism|date = 2008-04-09|accessdate = 2015-08-03|website = Financial Action Task Force (FATF)|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other national partners include the Qatar Financial Centre, State Security Bureau, Ministry of Interior, Criminal Investigation Department Section of Fighting Economic Crimes, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Business and Trade, Public Prosecution, General Directorate of Customs, Financial Institutions, and Ministry of Social Affairs.

== International cooperation ==
QFIU also partners with FIUs in the region and worldwide. It is an active member of the Egmont Group, an “informal network” of international FIUs organized “to foster international cooperation and information exchange” among its 139 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = List of Members {{!}} The Egmont Group|url = http://www.egmontgroup.org/about/list-of-members/by-region/asia|website = www.egmontgroup.org|accessdate = 2015-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  QFIU serves as co-chair of the Asia Group within Egmont, along with FIU-India.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In order to promote cooperation and information sharing with international and regional FIU’s and provide professional development to its staff, QFIU is a regular participant in Egmont and other FIU and Anti-Money Laundering conferences and forums.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.qfiu.gov.qa/files/QFIU_Annual_ENG_2014.pdf|title = QFIU Annual Report 2014|date = |accessdate = |website = Qatar Financial Information Unit|publisher = Government of Qatar|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, QFIU signed a Statement of Cooperation with the Japan Financial Intelligence Center to expand financial intelligence sharing by “facilitating the exchange of information in assisting investigations concerning money laundering, terrorist financing and related crimes.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Global Arab Network {{!}} Qatar, Japan Boosting Joint Economic cooperation {{!}} Economics {{!}} Economics|url = http://www.english.globalarabnetwork.com/201010017489/Economics/qatar-japan-boosting-joint-economic-cooperation.html|website = www.english.globalarabnetwork.com|accessdate = 2015-08-03|first = Adnan|last = Kassar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
A 2008 report produced by the Middle East and North African Financial Action Task Force and conducted by [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] officials raised several shortcomings in QFIU’s creation and operations. According to the report, “The main shortcoming is that the administrative order establishing the FIU and empowering it with a number of functions appears to be inconsistent with the provisions of the AML Law that gave such powers to the coordinator of NAMLC.” It also noted that “the quality of STR [Suspicious Transaction Reports] needs improving,” that information was not adequately protected, and that there was periodic review of its effectiveness in combatting terrorism finance and money laundering.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

QFIU addressed these issues directly in its 2009 Annual Report, declaring, “The FIU attached high importance to amending Law No. (28) of 2008 on Anti-Money Laundering and its amendments, following the mutual  evaluation report of the International Monetary Fund in 2007, which revealed many deficiencies and weaknesses in the legislative regulations related to anti-money laundering and terrorism financing.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.qfiu.gov.qa/files/2009%20FIU%20annual%20report-eng%20high.pdf|title = QFIU Annual Report 2009|date = |accessdate = |website = Qatar Financial Information Unit|publisher = Government of Qatar|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; To improve its operations, QFIU developed an eight-point, five-year strategic plan, which commenced in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although Qatar has enacted several pieces of legislation to address gaps and inconsistencies in its anti-money laundering and terrorism finance laws in recent years, the country has been criticized for not fully implementing or enforcing these measures. Former US Treasury Department official Matthew Levitt has noted, “To date, implementation and enforcement have not been a component of Qatar’s approach to these issues. Instead, Qatar routinely stresses to investors and critics alike the passage of laws that, on paper, appear robust but are almost never implemented or enforced.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/international/218706-qatars-not-so-charitable-record-on-terror-finance|title = Qatar's Not-So-Charitable Record on Terror Finance|last = Levitt|first = Matthew|date = 2014-09-24|work = The Hill|access-date = 2015-08-03|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 2013 Annual Report, QFIU reported record numbers of Suspicious Transaction Reports (313) and suspects (352), though these numbers may reflect better adoption of anti-money laundering and terrorism finance measures as opposed to an increase in suspicious activities. Only 112 cases were disseminated to judicial or law enforcement authorities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to a 2014 [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] report, Qatar prosecuted only one money-laundering case in 2013, and had no convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Countries/Jurisdictions of Primary Concern - Qatar|url = https://www.state.gov/j/inl/rls/nrcrpt/2014/supplemental/227981.htm?goMobile=0|accessdate = 2015-08-03|website = Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs|publisher = U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same report lists Qatar as a “Major Money Laundering Country” and a “country of concern.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.state.gov/j/inl/rls/nrcrpt/2014/vol2/222471.htm|title = 2014 INCSR: Major Money Laundering Countries|date = |accessdate = 2015-08-03|website = Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs|publisher = U.S. Department of State|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

QFIU reported even larger numbers of Suspicious Transaction Reports (516) and suspects (787) in 2014, though the number of cases disseminated to national or foreign law enforcement agencies declined markedly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7276">In mathematics, '''real trees''' (also called '''&lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;-trees''') are a class of [[metric space]]s generalising [[Tree (graph theory)|simplicial trees]]. They arise naturally in many mathematical contexts, in particular [[geometric group theory]] and probability theory. They are also the simplest examples of [[Gromov hyperbolic space]]s.

== Definition and examples ==

=== Formal definition ===

[[File:Y property.png|130px|thumb|A triangle in a real tree]]

A metric space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a real tree if it is a [[Geodesic#Metric geometry|geodesic]] space where every triangle is a tripod. That is, for every three points &lt;math&gt;x, y, \rho \in X&lt;/math&gt; there exists a point &lt;math&gt;c = x \wedge y&lt;/math&gt; such that the geodesic segments &lt;math&gt;[\rho,x], [\rho,y]&lt;/math&gt; intersect in the segment &lt;math&gt;[\rho,c]&lt;/math&gt; and also &lt;math&gt;c \in [x,y]&lt;/math&gt;. This definition is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; being a "zero-hyperbolic space" in the sense of Gromov (all triangles are "zero-thin"). 
Real trees can also be characterised by a topological property. A metric space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a real tree if for any pair of points &lt;math&gt;x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt; all (topological) embeddings &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; of the segment &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\sigma(0) = x, \, \sigma(1) = y&lt;/math&gt; have the same image (which is then a geodesic segment from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;).

=== Simple examples ===

*If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a graph with the combinatorial metric then it is a real tree if and only if it is a tree (i.e. it has no cycles). Such a tree is often called a simplicial tree. They are characterised by the following topological property: a real tree &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is simplicial if and only if the set of singular points of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (points whose complement in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has three or more connected components) is discrete in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
* The R-tree obtained in the following way is nonsimplicial. Start with the interval [0,2] and glue, for each positive integer n, an interval of length 1/n to the point 1−1/n in the original interval. The set of singular points is discrete, but fails to be closed since 1 is an ordinary point in this R-tree. Gluing an interval to 1 would result in a closed set of singular points at the expense of discreteness.
* The Paris metric makes the plane into a real tree. It is defined as follows: one fixes an origin &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, and if two points are on the same ray from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, their distance is defined as the Euclidean distance. Otherwise, their distance is defined to be the sum of the Euclidean distances of these two points to the origin &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.
* More generally any [[hedgehog space]] is an example of a real tree.

== In mathematical context ==

Real trees often appear, in various situations, as limits of more classical metric spaces.

=== Brownian trees ===

A [[brownian tree]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Aldous | first = D. | authorlink = David Aldous | date = 1991 | title = The continuum random tree I | journal = [[Annals of Probability]] | volume = 19 | pages = 1–28.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a (non-simplicial) real tree almost surely. Brownian trees arise as limits of various random processes on finite trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Aldous | first = D. | authorlink = David Aldous | date = 1991 | title = The continuum random tree III | journal = [[Annals of Probability]] | volume = 21 | pages = 248–289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ultralimits of metric spaces ===

Any [[ultralimit]] of a sequence of hyperbolic spaces is a real tree. In particular, the [[Ultralimit#Asymptotic cones|asymptotic cone]] of any hyperbolic space is a real tree.

=== Limit of group actions ===

Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group. For a sequence of based &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-spaces &lt;math&gt;(X_i, *_i, \rho_i)&lt;/math&gt; there is a notion of convergence to a based &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-space &lt;math&gt;(X_\infty, x_\infty, \rho_\infty)&lt;/math&gt; due to M. Bestvina and F. Paulin. When the spaces are hyperbolic and the actions are unbounded the limit (if it exists) is a real tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Bestvina | first = Mladen | authorlink = Mladen Bestvina | editor-last1 = | editor-first1 = | title = Handbook of Geometric Topology | contribution = &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;-trees in topology, geometry and group theory | pages = 55–91 | year = 2002 | publisher = Elsevier | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8OYxdADnhZoC&amp;pg=PA55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple example is obtained by taking &lt;math&gt;G = \pi_1(S)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a compact surface, and &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; the universal cover of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; with the metric &lt;math&gt;i\rho&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed hyperbolic metric on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;).

This is useful to produce actions of hyperbolic groups on real trees. Such actions are analyzed using the so-called [[Rips machine]]. A case of particular interest is the study of degeneration of groups acting properly discuntinuously on a [[Hyperbolic space|real hyperbolic space]] (this predates Rips', Bestvina's and Paulin's work and is due to J. Morgan and [[Peter Shalen|P. Shalen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

=== Algebraic groups ===

If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a field with an [[ultrametric space|ultrametric]] [[Valuation (algebra)|valuation]] then the [[Building (mathematics)|Bruhat–Tits building]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(F)&lt;/math&gt; is a real tree. It is simplicial if and only if the valuations is discrete.

== Generalisations ==

=== &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;-trees ===

If &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a totally ordered abelian group there is a natural notion of a distance with values in &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; (classical metric spaces correspond to &lt;math&gt;\Lambda = \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;). There is a notion of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;-tree&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Chiswell | first = Ian

 | location = River Edge, NJ
 | mr = 1851337

 | title = Introduction to Λ-trees
 | year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; which recovers simplicial trees (for &lt;math&gt;\Lambda = \mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt;) and real trees (for &lt;math&gt;\Lambda = \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;). The structure of finitely presented groups acting freely on &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; -trees was described.  &lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = O. Kharlampovich,  A. Myasnikov, D.  Serbin | title = Actions, length functions and non-archimedean words IJAC 23, No. 2, 2013.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, such a group acts freely on some  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; -tree.

=== Real buildings ===

The axioms for a [[Building (mathematics)|building]] can be generalized to give a definition of a real building. These arise for example as asymptotic cones of higher-rank [[symmetric spaces]] or as Bruhat—Tits buildings of higher-rank groups over valued fields.

'''Slew''' and '''slewing''' are terms which can refer to a spacecraft's orientation or movement in reference to a plane or fixed position such as [[Earth]], the [[Sun]], another celestial body or other point in space.&lt;ref name=messenger_pj&gt;{{cite web|url=http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14805|title=PIA14805: A Sideways Glance|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NASA_LSI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lunarscience.nasa.gov/articles/tycho-central-peak-spectacular|title=Tycho Central Peak Spectacular!|publisher=NASA's Lunar Science Institute|accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gcn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/3590.gcn3|title=GCN GRB Observation Report|publisher=NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center|accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During space flight, a craft's attitude must be controlled for reasons dependent upon the craft's mission. Keeping a  spacecraft slewed properly is vital toward ensuring that its high-gain antenna remains oriented toward Earth for sending and receiving data and commands. Additionally with many craft, keeping their solar arrays angled toward the Sun optimizes their power absorption and reduces the craft's reliance on internal power systems. Thermal heating and cooling of a craft and its subsystems can also be controlled by the craft's orientation. Cameras or other sensing equipment that are fixed into position upon the craft need to be aimed by slewing the craft.  A spacecraft can either be spin stabilized or 3-axis stabilized to maintain proper orientation.&lt;ref name=Basics11&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf11-2.php|title=Basics of Space Flight: Section II|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Spin-stabilized satellite|spin-stabilized spacecraft]], slewing is accomplished by applying a (significant) torque to the spacecraft, in general by operating a [[Vernier thruster|thruster]] in synchronous or asynchronous direction to its spin to adjust its spin rate.&lt;ref name=dictionary1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/s.html#slewing|title=Dictionary of Technical Terms for Space|publisher=NASA's Software, Robotics and Simulation Division|accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This results in a [[precession]] and slews for this kind of spacecraft are therefore also called "precession manoeuvre."

The slew of [[3-axis stabilized spacecraft]] is typically in [[Control theory|closed loop control]] with thrusters or electrically-powered [[reaction wheel]]s maintaining or altering the craft's attitude based on sensor measurements.  A typical example is a space telescope that should be turned to observe a new celestial object. But also for 3-axis stabilized spacecraft for which the normal attitude is not inertially fixed the spacecraft is said to make a slew if the attitude is changed in another way and with another, mostly higher, rate than when in the basic attitude control mode. An example is the [[Magellan probe]] that once per orbit interrupted the scanning of the Venus surface making a large turn to direct its high gain antenna to the Earth for data transmission.

'''Social cleansing''' ({{lang-es|limpieza social}}) is class-based killing that consists of elimination of members of society considered "undesirable," including but not limited to the homeless, criminals, [[street children]], the elderly, sex workers, and sexual minorities{{clarify|date=May 2015}}.&lt;ref name="ord 18"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1995, p. 384"&gt;Schwartz 1995, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="san 110"&gt;Sanford 2008, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon is caused by a combination of economic and social factors, but killings are notably present in regions with high levels of poverty and disparities of wealth.&lt;ref name="ord 18"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fed 12"&gt;Federici 2010, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Perpetrators are usually of the same community as the victims and are often motivated by the idea that the victims are a drain on the resources of society.&lt;ref name="ord 18"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Federici 2010, p. 18"&gt;Federici 2010, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts by national and local governments to stop these killings have been largely ineffective, and the government and police forces are often involved in the killings, especially in South America.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1995, p. 384"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ab 187"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mig 1155"/&gt;

==Causes==

===Africa===
In African countries, social cleansing almost always takes the form of [[witch hunting]],{{fact|date=April 2016}} which is most common in areas with poor economic circumstances.&lt;ref name="fed 12"&gt;Federici 2010, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Several social and economic theories exist as to why such circumstances have arisen and led to accusations of witchcraft, including warfare, natural disasters, unequal patterns of development, and larger forces of [[globalization]]. Most scholars agree that the cause of social cleansing efforts is a result of "interaction of economic conditions and cultural factors."&lt;ref&gt;Miguel 2005, p. 1169.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these theories must be linked to larger societal trends, including the devaluation and social marginalization of women as well as the placement of blame on individuals for their own economic misfortunes in lieu of recognition of global and local economic forces at play.&lt;ref name="fed14"&gt;Federici 2010, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zachrisson 2007, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, several scholars have emphasized the outside groups and circumstances related to these killings to dispute the idea that they are simply a cultural norm.&lt;ref name="fed11"&gt;Federici 2010, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miguel 2005, p. 1159.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic====
In many countries, income disparities have led to social tensions and a climate of "mutual suspicion".&lt;ref name="Federici 2010, p. 18"&gt;Federici 2010, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The wealthy and powerful are perceived as having obtained their wealth through "evil arts", while the economically disadvantaged are accused of responsibility for misfortunes of the community.&lt;ref name="Federici 2010, p. 18"/&gt; There is also evidence that the causes of social cleansing are linked to globalization and [[economic liberalization]], "to the extent that it has stripped entire populations of their means of subsistence, torn communities apart, deepened economic inequalities and forced people to compete for diminishing resources."{{fact|date=April 2016}}&lt;ref name="fed11" /&gt; Many African communities have been destabilized as communal lands have been privatized, local currency has been devalued, and public services have been eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Federici 2010, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;
Sometimes these larger economic trends have been linked to more specific events. For example, in Southern Zimbabwe, violent wars led certain areas to be neglected in development efforts, leading to a lack of resources and increasing disparities of wealth in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;Zachrisson 2007, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In Tanzania, scholars have found positive correlations between extreme rainfall (both floods and droughts) and large negative income shocks and famine. These periods have been statistically linked to increases in murder of witches.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel 2005, p. 1166.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cultural====
Several cultural explanations for social cleansing in Africa are related to religion.{{fact|date=April 2016}} One  that has been offered by scholars is the presence of [[Pentecostalists]], whose focus on the occult has been spread by the media and increased social anxiety. Pentecostalists have been recorded as preaching connections between illness and the devil, which has combined potently with existing indigenous beliefs, most notably in Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, and Tanzania.&lt;ref name="fed 12" /&gt; In Tanzania, a positive correlation exists between witch killing and areas where populations practice traditional religions, where belief in witchcraft is strong.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel 2005, p.1154.&lt;/ref&gt; While scholars have suggested that the presence of these beliefs is important because it demonstrates that perpetrators generally do believe that their victims are practicing witchcraft, they also recognize that populations of traditional religious beliefs are often also of low socio-economic status, which supports their assertion that poverty is still the primary factor in motivating killings.&lt;ref&gt;Federici 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
The most widespread myth about social cleansing in Latin America is that these killings are all related to drug use.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 1995, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the phenomenon is larger than the drug problem and is related to state ideology, a culture of violence, and inequitable wealth distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Within Colombia specifically, economic factors account for many of the reasons behind these killings, but such factors are additionally "aggravated by external political and economic pressures from the United States".&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 1995, p. 385&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic====
Latin America has an extremely large number of individuals living below the poverty line, and these individuals are largely blamed for their impoverished state.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 1995, pp.387-388&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these individuals are in critical poverty, meaning that they do not even have the ability to secure food and shelter.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; This critical poverty is connected to inflation rates that has led the cost of living to increase and the minimum salary to be hardly adequate for survival.&lt;ref name="ord28"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, the gap between the rich and poor has widened, and funds for welfare programs and social services has decreased while funding for security forces to protect "the haves from the have-nots" have tripled in Colombia specifically.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, pp.27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Culture of violence====
{{main|Crime and violence in Latin America}}

Latin America's history has long been plagued by political violence, which over time has morphed into class-based violence.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 1995, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt; Despite mostly formally democratic governments, the "legacy of authoritarianism" lingers, and the presence of "armed actors" is prevalent as a result of a long history of violence between military, [[paramilitary]], and guerilla groups.&lt;ref&gt;Koonings 2001, p.402.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of this culture of violence has had various effects on the underclass in countries in Latin America. The military and especially the police have been known to use violence to harm citizens rather than protect them.&lt;ref name="koon 404"&gt;Koonings 2001, p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt; Private "vigilante" security forces have likewise used violence against the poor with the idea of promoting law and order, especially in Colombia, Guatemala, and Peru.&lt;ref name="koon 404" /&gt; Though many guerilla groups are much less violent than when they originally emerged, they are a presence and an additional source of violence, especially in Colombia.&lt;ref name="koon 404" /&gt; Tension between political groups has led these guerilla groups, the government, and vigilante actors to suspect peasants of working with their enemy and to intimidate them into leaving land in the countryside for the city.&lt;ref name="ord28" /&gt; Other poor rural residents have been forced to leave due to general violence or lack of public services.&lt;ref name="ord28" /&gt; Violence at the local level is also extremely common by organized criminals such as street gangs, drug bosses, vigilante justice groups, and local civil patrols.&lt;ref name="koon 404" /&gt; When poor residents are forced to move to the city, they often must turn to prostitution, crime, or begging in inner-city ghettos, which puts them in an extremely vulnerable position in the presence of these violent groups.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, pp.28-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Men in particular become even more entrenched in the culture of violence as many join gangs to escape "social exclusion and economic disadvantage" and establish a sense of identity and masculinity.&lt;ref name="wild 741"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.741.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, violence exists at a level even smaller than the community—the home. Children are often victims of "physical, mental, and sexual abuse by adults member of their own families."&lt;ref name="ord 22"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; In Guatemala specifically, social cleansing occurs with the "backdrop of genocide," and homicide rates are still extremely high after "three decades of armed conflict" during the [[Guatemalan Civil War]].&lt;ref name="san 108"&gt;Sanford 2008, p.108.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence experienced across the region has led to an erosion of social capital, which was described by Colombians as including "'social mistrust,' 'lack of unity,' 'fear' and 'lack of social institutions.'" &lt;ref name="mc971"&gt;McIlwaine and Moser 2001, p.971.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social cleansing in Spain ==
Spain, during times before colonization, demonstrates societal patterns that shaped life in Spain in terms of prejudice and discrimination. The discriminatory practice of Spanish legislation led to a certain caste system, pertaining to those with or without honor. Moreover one's reputation and the way one was treated was based on aspects such as honor, legitimacy, and the limpieza de sangre, a prejudicial marker that indicates one’s purity of blood, relating to their family timeline and deciding how society was to treat them.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Faces of Honor: Sex, Shame, and Violence in Colonial Latin America|last=Johnson|first=Lyman L.|last2=Lipsett-Rivera|first2=Sonya|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year=1998|isbn=0-8263-1942-6|location=Albuquerque|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  “Historic meanings of honor included those cultural specific ways that Spaniards had always rationalized discrimination due to defects in birth (illegitimate, nonnoble), religion (non-Catholic), and race (nonwhite).” &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This discriminatory institution based on these concepts of honor, limpieza, and legitimacy, is expressed through the legislation of Spanish government at the time. An example of this is was in 1414 when Pope Benedict XIII approved the constitution of Spanish College’s San Bartolomé, which linked these concepts through the school's acceptances.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Those excepted into the school had to prove they had pure blood, rather than Jewish, Moorish, or heretical heritage.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Social Cleansing in Colonial Latin America ==
The concept of "limpieza de sangre," or purity of blood, was used in societies of Spain and Portugal, originating from Iberian culture, where reputation was inherited by one's ancestors.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Faces of Honor: Sex, Shame, and Violence in Colonial Latin America|last=Johnson|first=Lyman L.|last2=Lipsett-Rivera|first2=Sonya|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year=1998|isbn=0-8263-1942-6|location=Albuquerque|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Had there been someone found to be a race such as Jewish, a converted Jewish, or Muslim in their family timeline, it was said to be a stain on their ancestry.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Consequently, one's own ancestry determined their reputation and social standing, impacting other aspects such as access to education, career, and marriage for further generations. This became known as the culture of honor, which resided in such reputational ancestry that came to define how individuals were respected.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Limpieza de sangre affected life for every individual in the Spanish and Portuguese colonies, including the degree to exclusion and racial discrimination. When Europe came to colonize the "New World" these ethics of honor and limpieza de sangre implied that those with blood lacking purity to European standards was inferior. The Europeans were at the "apex" of social structure and everyone who was not identical in blood was inferior.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; As colonists, the presumed inferiors were the colonized and thus, due to this culture of honor, they became victims of this discrimination. While over time assimilation and miscegenation and admixture complicated this concept of social cleansing, the ideals of "purity of blood" prevailed, and elite was considered to be of European and Christian origins.

The conquest of indigenous people in Latin America strengthened these ideals. The vulnerability of one's identity in colonial America gave way to ones defense of honor, except for the elites and those in power, typically the colonists. As the degree of honor perceived by individuals was reputational, people felt the need to be confirmed by society or from those in good social standing through submission into the given standards that one's place holds.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The pursuit of this honor leads to many disputes, as well as the fear of being rejected by society and losing one's place.

Despite these long-lived standards, during post colonialism, the ideals of Latin America changed with independence and the growth of democratic values. With this, the culture of honor and respect in those with pure bloodlines changed.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; People began to socially include those who were previously seen as inferior.

==Social cleansing in Brazil==

===Victims and Methods===
The most common murder victim in [[Brazil]] is a young, black male living in a [[favela]], or a Brazilian slum.&lt;ref name="wild 730"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.730.&lt;/ref&gt; These young men typically are, or are assumed to be, gang members and criminals.&lt;ref name="wild 723"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.723.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence and murder are most common in areas that are economically disadvantaged and socially marginalized.&lt;ref name="wild 726"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.726.&lt;/ref&gt; Women are often targets by association, though the effects of social cleansing and violence against women are largely absent in existing research.&lt;ref name="wild 733"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.733&lt;/ref&gt; Killings are often in public places, with victims being beaten or shot in the street.&lt;ref name="wild 739"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.739.&lt;/ref&gt; Police groups sometimes simply enter the community in a large armoured vehicle called a ""caveirão"" and start shooting.&lt;ref name="wild 743"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.743.&lt;/ref&gt; This vehicle contributes to the "anonymity and impunity for the perpetrators."&lt;ref name="wild 743"/&gt;

===Perpetrators and Motivations===
Social cleansing in Brazil is the result of a "murky symbiosis [that] has developed between the official security forces and paramilitary and vigilante-type actors" that carry out "law enforcement against the 'marginal classes.'"&lt;ref name="koon 404" /&gt; State actors often act against the poor "as a form or result of exclusion and oppression."&lt;ref name="wild 725"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.725.&lt;/ref&gt; Gangs serve as a scapegoat for the levels of violence and lack of security in many communities.&lt;ref name="wild 726"/&gt; Private groups and some gangs perpetrate killings in attempts to take policing into their own hands.&lt;ref name="wild 732"&gt;Wilding 2010, p.732.&lt;/ref&gt; While some killings are a result of groups attempting to punish criminals for misdemeanors, others are a result of perceived threats of poor citizens, such as members of workers' movements.&lt;ref name="wild 733"/&gt;&lt;ref name="koon 2001"&gt;Koonings 2001, p.405.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social cleansing in Colombia==

In the 1980s, "social cleansing" groups started to be created. Their main mission was "to make justice" by killing all non-appropriate people in social terms, like prostitutes, street-living people, transvestites, and drug addicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Violence in Colombia: Building Sustainable Peace and Social Capital|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BZfIGhYF-BAC&amp;pg=RA1-PR2|date=January 2000|publisher=World Bank Publications|isbn=978-0-8213-4383-8|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Victims and Methods===
Victims of social cleansing in [[Colombia]] are members of society who are considered "undesirable" and "disposable."&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1995, p. 384"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; They are economically disadvantaged, usually live on the streets, and are considered to be a burden on society, "the cause of the country's problems, rather than a consequence of them."&lt;ref name="ord19"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Street children====
One of these groups is street children, who are without homes due to abuse, forced displacement, or the death of their parents.&lt;ref name="ord 22" /&gt; Death rates for street children have been as high as six to eight children per day.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Children are often shot in their sleep or stabbed to death on the streets or in the police station. A 1993 case in which a 9-year-old girl was strangled to death in Bogota brought attention to this problem and led to nominal reforms.&lt;ref name="ord 22" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 2001, p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Police targets street children specifically under the assumption that they are drug users and criminals. This is to some extent true, as many use drugs to relieve pain and avoid hunger and must shoplift to survive.&lt;ref name="ord 22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ord388"&gt;Schwartz 2001, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite living in conditions of extreme vulnerability to "aggression and danger," the National Police poses the greatest threat to street children's survival, as they drive them off the streets and target them in social cleansing.&lt;ref name="ord 22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ord388" /&gt;

====Poor criminals, drug users, and drug dealers====
Poor criminals, drug users, and drug dealers are also common targets. From 1988 to 1993, these individuals collectively comprised 56% of social cleansing victims.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1995, p. 390"&gt;Schwartz 1995, p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals are often victims of physical and sexual abuse by the police and vigilante groups known as "comas".&lt;ref name="ord23"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; One common method of killing these individuals in the city of Bogota is the Choachí run, in which victims are taken to the top of a mountain in the town of Choachí, executed, and thrown off the mountain. In some cases, they are released to attempt escape, but die by falling down the mountain or being shot at as they run.&lt;ref name="ord23" /&gt; A similar method is known as "the ride," in which victims are forced into a vehicle, killed, and left in a desolate area.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 2001, p.394.&lt;/ref&gt; Death squads have employed other means for killing suspected criminals, such as murdering them and then cutting off their hands and putting them in small boxes in public spaces to intimidate other criminals.&lt;ref name="ord19" /&gt; Another group has been known to shoot victims and then cast their bodies into the municipal stadium.&lt;ref name="ord19" /&gt;

====Sex workers and sexual minorities====
Sex workers and sexual minorities are treated quite similarly in regards to social cleansing, as both are hard to identify and victims of heavy discrimination despite the fact that both homosexuality and prostitution are legal.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, pp. 23-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Many female sex workers are forced into the line of work due to poverty and domestic violence.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1995, p. 390"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ord23" /&gt; Both male and female sex workers are often harassed by the police, and males specifically are demanded to pay a "tax" where "failure to pay results in beatings or imprisonment."&lt;ref name="ord 26"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In an upside-down system, encounters with dishonest police are preferable to honest police, as the dishonest will accept bribes, while the honest are more likely to kill.&lt;ref name="ord 26" /&gt; Sexual minorities are particularly difficult to identify, because not only do some male sex workers participate in gay sex out of economic necessity, but victims are only considered homosexual if they were dressed as females at the time of death.&lt;ref name="ord 26" /&gt;

====Beggars and Recyclers====
Another group includes those individuals in the most extreme form of poverty. These individuals subsist by asking for money and/or collecting garbage.&lt;ref name="ord 24"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The police have been known to kill these victims in especially cruel ways, such as pouring gasoline on them and setting them on fire.&lt;ref name="ord 24" /&gt; It is also notable that at least 14 destitute individuals have been killed by security guards at one Colombian university for the use of their bodies as cadavers in the medical school.&lt;ref name="ord 24" /&gt;

===Perpetrators and Motivations===

====National Police====
The National Police has played a large role in carrying out class-based killings in Colombia. The police created the term "disposable" (Spanish: ''desechable'') to define economically disadvantaged people who are considered to have no value to society.&lt;ref name="ord 18"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether directly or through "paramilitary clients," the National Police was responsible for 74% of deaths related to social cleansing in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz 2001, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; Motivations include "security, aesthetics, economic well-being, morals, and religion."&lt;ref name="ord19" /&gt; In regards to safety and economic well-being, rationales include the idea that the poor are or look like criminals and decrease public safety and drive customers away from businesses.&lt;ref name="ord 31"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Moral arguments include protection from homosexuals and prostitutes.&lt;ref name="ord 31" /&gt;

====Death Squads and Paramilitary Groups====
The distinction between death squads and paramilitary groups and the National Police is not always clear. Not only are policemen often members of these groups, but these groups typically enjoy the protection of the police.&lt;ref name="ord 18"&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Other members include businessmen, industrialists, guerillas, and soldiers.&lt;ref name="ord19" /&gt; Death squads emerged in the late 1970s, one of the first being the Black Hand, a group that murdered suspected criminals.&lt;ref name="ord 18" /&gt; Their reasoning behind these killings is the flawed legal system, which convicts less than 3% of criminals. Death squads and other groups believe it necessary to step in where the legal system has failed by eliminating these suspected criminals.&lt;ref name="ord 31" /&gt;  As of 1995, there were no less than 40 of these squads operating in Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Factors===

====National government====
The role of the national government in Colombia has largely been complicit cooperation with the National Police. By failing to deal with crime and then also effectively granting impunity to police and military groups, the state has allowed safety issues to be addressed with violence and  has perpetuated a "cycle of crime, lack of public safety, violent response, and impunity" due to "terrifying inefficiency and unwillingness to hold people accountable for their acts".&lt;ref name="ord19" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  While the government at least tries to protect street children through programs to put them in state-run homes, these programs often do not align with their actual needs and have largely failed.&lt;ref name="ord 22" /&gt; There have been limited attempts to protect those in poverty in the legal system, and one case of harassment against the poor resulted in a judge calling for their equal treatment and compensation from the offending policemen. However, the decision was not enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoñez 1996, pp. 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social cleansing in Guatemala==

===Victims and Methods===
Social cleansing and gang killings make up a large portion of the homicides in Guatemala.&lt;ref name="san 112"&gt;Sanford 2008, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Since gangs typically make no effort to cover up crimes and leave bodies at the place of death, "signs of torture," as well as location of the body, "serve as indicators of the existence of social cleansing," according to Elizabeth Sanford.&lt;ref name="san 111"&gt;Sanford 2008, p.111.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study by the Human Rights Ombudsman, "the increase in the number of women killed whose bodies bore marks of torture and other sadistic abuse accounted for 40 percent of the total increase in female murders in 2005."&lt;ref name="san 118"&gt;Sanford 2008, p.118.&lt;/ref&gt; Though female victims account for 10% of all homicides, over 18% of cadavers with signs of torture indicating social cleansing were female.&lt;ref name="san 111"/&gt;  Furthermore, 2% of female victims of homicide are prostitutes, a common victim group of social cleansing efforts.&lt;ref name="san 118"/&gt; Furthermore, young and destitute male gang members, especially those blamed for homicide of females, have been common victims of social cleansing.&lt;ref name="san 118"/&gt;
The most common form of killing, indicated by the 305 cadavers found in 2005, is strangulation.&lt;ref name="san 111"/&gt; Other common methods included victims being beaten, shot in the head, bound by their hands and feet, and in the case of female victims, sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="san 111"/&gt; Victims are abducted, taken to a different location, are tortured and killed, and finally have their body dumped in a different location.&lt;ref name="san 111"/&gt;

===Perpetrators and Motivations===
Perpetrators include the Guatemalan government as well as private groups either directly or indirectly complicit with the state.&lt;ref name="san 110"&gt;Sanford 2008, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Social cleansing efforts are targeted against gangs and other perceived and actual criminals, who are blamed for the high rates of homicide.&lt;ref name="san 111"/&gt; The perpetrators intend to both exterminate victims and intimidate other members of the target group.&lt;ref name="san 110"/&gt; Intimidation is carried out both through torture tactics used as well as propaganda including flyers and stickers that support social cleansing as a "method of social control."&lt;ref name="san 112"/&gt; Because perpetrators are directly or indirectly tied to the state, they naturally have impunity.&lt;ref name="san 110"/&gt;

===The origins of social cleansing in Guatemala===

The use of "social cleansing" efforts to eliminate criminals and other persons deemed to be socially dangerous has its origins during the period of military dictatorship and [[Guatemalan Civil War|civil war]] (1954-1996). During the 1960s and 70s, many state-operated paramilitary front organizations (so-called "death squads") emerged with the express purpose of exterminating suspected communists and other enemies of the state. These groups included the [[Mano Blanca|MANO]], NOA, CADEG, 'Ojo por Ojo' and others. While nominally employed against political targets, the use of "death squads" came to be seen by the Guatemalan police forces (specifically the National Police) as a crime fighting tool, particularly after the election of Col. Arana Osorio in 1970 and the subsequent "state of siege". One early example of the use of "death squads" against non-political targets was a phantom organization called the 'Avenging Vulture', which specifically targeted criminals.

==Social cleansing in Tanzania==

===Victims and Methods===
The most common victims of social cleansing efforts in [[Tanzania]] are elderly women, the majority of whom are of low socioeconomic status, but several groups of people who are considered burdens to the community, such as children, the sick, infants, and the handicapped, are also victims.&lt;ref name="mig 115356"&gt;Miguel 2005, pp. 1153-1156.&lt;/ref&gt; These people are usually accused of witchcraft following deaths or other misfortunes in society and tend to flee, choosing homelessness over death. Those who do not flee successfully are killed violently in their homes.&lt;ref name="mig 115356" /&gt; Sometimes those considered burdens are simply reduced to zero consumption and are starved to death. This occurs particularly among infants, who have no ability to flee or attempt to provide for themselves.&lt;ref name="mig 115356" /&gt;

===Perpetrators and Motivations===
Victims are typically killed by members of their own families, who blame them for economic suffering and household misfortune. Accusations and subsequent killings are often incited by death or illness in the family or the family's livestock. However, general misfortune in the form of "failed crops, lost jobs, and bad dreams also arouse suspicion."&lt;ref&gt;Miguel 2005, p. 1156&lt;/ref&gt; While often accusations are raised to the effect of creating a scapegoat, not all forms of social cleansing are connected to witch hunting. The extreme scarcity theory suggests that some families to drive out or starve unproductive family members to provide more nutrients for other members.&lt;ref name="mig1156-1158"&gt;Miguel 2005, pp. 1156-1558.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these perpetrators are young, unemployed men who see the elderly as a burden on their potential for success.&lt;ref name="fed 10"&gt;Federici 2010, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another key perpetrator of social cleansing in Tanzania are the [[Sungusungu]], councils of male elders that operate under the premise of promoting village security.&lt;ref name="mig1156-1158" /&gt;  These groups formed under the premise that the government was not able to prevent crimes such as theft, and they serve as a form of vigilante justice.&lt;ref name="ab 187"&gt;Abrahams 1987, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other actors===
Although the Tanzanian government has made public witchcraft accusations illegal, the efforts to stop them have been unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="mig 1155"&gt;Miguel 2005, p. 1155.&lt;/ref&gt; Conviction levels are extremely low, as "only seven of 1,622 individuals arrested in connection with witch killings during the 1970s and 1980s were convicted, and since then the conviction rate as apparently fallen even lower," according to  Edward Miguel.&lt;ref name="mig 1155" /&gt;  The perception of the government and police force as unable to control crime has led groups such as Sungusungu to take matters into their own hands, though studies suggest that the police may sometimes be involved in witch killings.&lt;ref name="ab 187" /&gt;

A '''social welfare model''' is a system of [[social welfare]] provision and its accompanying [[value system]]. It usually involves [[social policies]] that affect the welfare of a country's citizens within the framework of a market or mixed economy.

==Elements of a social welfare model==

===Taxation===
Taxation is concerned with how the state taxes the people, whether by a [[flat tax]], [[regressive tax]] or a [[progressive tax]] system. The most common guiding rule of taxation is to levy taxes by the ability to pay.

===Social insurance===
Social insurance is concerned with how the state implements [[social welfare|benefits]] for the unemployed, pensions, maternity and paternity leave and [[disabilities]].

===Public services===
Services such as [[health care]] can be almost entirely state funded, private [[insurance]]-based, or somewhere in-between. For example, the [[United Kingdom]] has an almost entirely publicly funded health service, the [[National Health Service]] (NHS), and [[Canada]] offers public health care offered at a [[province|provincial]] level. Conversely, in the [[United States]], individuals have to rely on health insurance policies in the event of hospitalization, and a minimal amount of state support for the poorer people exists. Another element can be [[public transport]], as some countries have nationalized rapid transit systems, while others have privatized them (in the UK for example, public transport has been privatised in [[Great Britain]] but not in [[Northern Ireland]]).

===Employment===
Economies with a more [[laissez-faire]] approach to employment will do nothing to provide job security. Other countries will rely on some degree of [[regulation]] to protect workers from arbitrary firings. A high degree of regulation such as expensive severance fees is often cited reason for making employers reluctant to hire and causing unemployment.

==Examples==

=== European welfare models ===
{{main|European social model}}

==== British Model====
Used by the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], and the [[South Asia|South Asian countries]] the British model tends to have a [[welfare state]] of roughly average size, relative to [[High income country|high-income]] [[OECD]] countries, but less comprehensive than those in [[Scandinavia]] and much of continental Europe. They have somewhat more poverty and higher inequality. Despite having a smaller welfare state than most Western European countries, the UK, Ireland and Canada do provide, among other things, universal single payer health care, redistribute income and guarantee an income at subsistence level.&lt;ref name="Barr"&gt;Barr, N. (2004), ''Economics of the welfare state''. New York: Oxford University Press (USA).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Continental European ====
Used by [[Austria]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]], the Continental model has strict rules on job protection and a large amount of regulation in [[industry]]. However, the [[labour market]] has proven to be inflexible and slow to react to [[globalization]]. Generous insurance-based [[unemployment benefits]] and a well funded welfare state are used to reduce poverty and provide high quality health care. This model can generally be seen as middle ground between the British and Nordic models.

==== Mediterranean ====
Used by [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Greece]], [[Portugal]], the [[Mediterranean]] model is similar to the Continental model, but focuses welfare on generous state-pensions. The labour market is inflexible with the same job protectionism as in the Continental model, but is not good at reducing poverty within the [[Working class|lower end]] of society.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==== The Nordic Model ====
The [[Scandinavian welfare model|Nordic Model]], mainly refers to Nordic countries  [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Iceland]], [[Finland]] but some include the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref&gt;http://everything2.com/title/Nordic+model&lt;/ref&gt; also called 'Nordic corporatist' model because of strong influence of the [[corporatism|corporatist]] elements such as [[labor union]]s and [[employers' organization]]s, advocates a highly developed and government-funded welfare state which provides generous unemployment benefits among other resources for the general public. Labor markets are kept mobile with easy firing and hiring, and government taking care of those laid off with unemployment benefits and retraining. The equality of the Nordic model is achieved through progressive taxation. As a result of the policy, Sweden, Denmark and Norway have the lowest income disparities in the world. Nordic countries have been enjoying high economic and productivity growth, but most remarkably they consistently conquer top spots in [[Satisfaction with Life Index|world happiness surveys]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6360517.stm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-happiest-places-on-earth-are-heavily-taxed&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The United States of America ===
{{see also|American way of life}}
Before the Great Depression, the United States adhered to a social model that could be summarized by the term "rugged individualism": the understanding that because most people are capable of taking care of themselves, each person should be left to succeed or fail on their own, only fettered by the bounds of the law, and the government should be limited to protection of [[civil liberties]]. The United States had very little in the way of a [[social safety net]] for its citizens, with most people depending on their families and private social organizations if they were unable to provide for themselves; this partially explains the enduring greater emphasis on family and religion in American society and politics today than in other comparably developed countries in [[Western Europe]].

As a result of increased modernization in the late 19th century, this view changed in the emergence of the [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive Movement]], which held that the government can and should have a greater role in regulating the economy, so as to promote a better life for all of its citizens. The biggest change came with President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]], during which time the American government intervened extensively in the economy, guided often by [[Keynesian economics]]. New programs included relief for the poor, unemployed, and those who cannot work due to youth, old age, or disability.

However, since the [[Great Depression]], the United States has not followed other developed democracies in the establishment of a more comprehensive model for assuring its citizens' well being. One possible explanation for this is that the U.S was not affected in the same way by World War II as Europe was: while Europeans relied on strong centralized governments to help rebuild their economies after two world wars, the United States was enjoying a period of unprecedented economic growth due to its being one of the few industrialized countries on the planet whose productive capacity had not been destroyed by enemy nations. But now, with the rise of industrial and geo-political competition in Europe and Asia, growing income inequality, high energy prices, and mounting public debt, there is renewed debate over the role of government in modern society.

{{Sociology}}
In any given society, a '''taboo''' is an implicit prohibition on something (usually against an utterance or behavior) based on a cultural sense that it is excessively repulsive or, perhaps, too sacred for ordinary people.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. "[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/579821/taboo Taboo]." Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Retrieved 21 Mar. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary, 11th Edition. "[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/taboo Taboo]."&lt;/ref&gt; Such prohibitions are present in virtually all societies.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; On a comparative basis taboos, for example related to food items, seem to make no sense at all as what may be declared unfit for one group by [[Custom (law)|custom]] or [[religion]] may be perfectly acceptable to another.

Whether scientifically correct or not, taboos are often meant to protect the human individual, but there are numerous other reasons for their existence. An ecological or medical background is apparent in many, including some that are seen as religious or spiritual in origin. Taboos can help utilize a resource more efficiently, but when applied to only a subsection of the community they can also serve to suppress a subsection of the [[community]]. A taboo acknowledged by a particular group or [[tribe]] as part of their ways, aids in the cohesion of the group, helps that particular group to stand out and maintain its identity in the face of others and therefore creates a feeling of "belonging".&lt;ref name="Meyer-Rochow 2009" /&gt;

The meaning of the word "taboo" has been somewhat expanded in the [[social science]]s to strong prohibitions relating to any area of human activity or custom that is sacred or forbidden based on [[Morality|moral judgment]], religious beliefs, or cultural [[norm (sociology)|norms]].&lt;ref name="Meyer-Rochow 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Meyer-Rochow| first= Victor Benno | title= Food taboos: their origins and purposes|journal= Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine | date=2009| volume=5-18:|

==Etymology==
The term "taboo" comes from the [[Tongan language|Tongan]] ''[[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]]'' or [[Fijian language|Fijian]] ''tabu'' ("prohibited", "disallowed", "forbidden"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; related among others to the [[Maori language|Maori]] ''tapu'', [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] ''kapu'', and [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] ''fady''. Its English use dates to 1777 when the British explorer [[Captain James Cook|James Cook]] visited [[Tonga]], and referred to the [[Tongans]]' use of the term "taboo" for "any thing is forbidden to be eaten, or made use of".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|King|1821|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=h6UFAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA462 462]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote:
{{Quote|Not one of them would sit down, or eat a bit of any thing.... On expressing my surprise at this, they were all taboo, as they said; which word has a very comprehensive meaning; but, in general, signifies that a thing is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|King|1821|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=h6UFAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA348 348]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term was translated to him as "consecrated, inviolable, forbidden, unclean or cursed."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Cook|King|1821}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tabu'' itself has been derived from alleged Tongan [[Morpheme|morphemes]] ''ta'' ("mark") and ''bu'' ("especially"), but this may be a [[False etymology|folk etymology]] (Tongan does not actually have a [[phoneme]] /b/), and ''tapu'' is usually treated as a unitary, non-[[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] word inherited from [[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]] *''tapu'', in turn inherited from [[Proto-Oceanic language|Proto-Oceanic]] *''tabu'', with the [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] meaning "sacred, forbidden."&lt;ref&gt;[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]. "[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=taboo&amp;searchmode=none Taboo]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

On the main island, the word is often appended to the end of "Tonga" as ''Tongatapu'', here meaning "Sacred South" rather than "Forbidden South".

[[Sigmund Freud]] speculated that [[incest taboo|incest]] and [[patricide]] were the only two universal taboos and formed the basis of civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund. ''[[Totem and Taboo]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, although [[cannibalism]], in-group [[murder]], and [[incest]] are taboo in the majority of societies, exceptions can be found, such as marriages between brothers and sisters in [[Roman Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;

Common taboos involve restrictions or ritual regulation of killing and hunting; sex and sexual relationships; reproduction; the [[taboo on the dead|dead]] and their graves; as well as food and dining (primarily cannibalism and [[dietary laws]] such as [[vegetarianism]], ''[[kashrut]]'', and ''[[halal]]'') or religious ([[treif]] and [[haram]]). In [[Madagascar]], a strong code of taboos, known as ''[[fady (taboo)|fady]]'', constantly change and are formed from new experiences. Each region, village or tribe may have its own ''fady''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The word "taboo" gained popularity at times, with some scholars looking for ways to apply it where other English words had previously been applied. For example, [[John Merlin Powis Smith|J. M. Powis Smith]], in his book ''The American Bible'' (editor's preface 1927), used "taboo" occasionally in relation to Israel's [[Tabernacle]] and ceremonial laws, including {{Bibleverse|Exodus|30:36}}, {{Bibleverse|Exodus|29:37}}; {{Bibleverse|Numbers|16:37–38}}; {{Bibleverse|Deuteronomy|22:9}}, {{Bibleverse|Isaiah|65:5}}, {{Bibleverse|Ezekiel|44:19}} and {{Bibleverse|Ezekiel|46:20}}.

[[Albert Schweitzer]] wrote a chapter about taboos of the people of Gabon. As an example, it was considered a misfortune for twins to be born, and they would be subject to many rules not incumbent on other people.&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, Albert. ''African Notebook'' 1958. Indiana University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
[[Communist]] and [[materialist]] theorists have argued that taboos can be used to reveal the histories of societies when other records are lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Marta Dyczok|author2=Oxana Gaman-Golutvina|title=Media, Democracy and Freedom: The Post-Communist Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meUcrEBRpgMC|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-3-0343-0311-8|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=meUcrEBRpgMC&amp;pg=PA209 209]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marvin Harris]] particularly endeavored to explain taboos as a consequence of ecologic and economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://sociology101.net/readings/Indias-sacred-cow.pdf |author=Marvin Harris |title=India's Sacred Cow |access-date=2015-07-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610221816/http://sociology101.net/readings/Indias-sacred-cow.pdf |archive-date=2015-06-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernity==
Some argue that contemporary [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] societies have taboos against [[tribalism]]s (for example, [[ethnocentrism]] and [[nationalism]]) and [[prejudice]]s ([[racism]], [[sexism]], [[religious extremism]]).&lt;ref name="Putnam, Robert D. 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | last= Putnam | first = Robert D. | author-link = Robert D.

Changing social customs and standards also create new taboos, such as bans on [[history of slavery|slavery]]; extension of the [[pedophilia]] taboo to [[ephebophilia]];&lt;ref name="www.usccb.org"&gt;{{cite web|first=Frederick |last=S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10597">'''Teasing'''  has multiple meanings and uses. In human interactions, teasing exists in three major forms: ''playful'', ''hurtful'',  and ''educative''. Teasing can have a variety of effects, depending on how it is utilized and its intended effect.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy, V. (1991). Playing with others' expectations: Teasing and mucking about in the first year. (pp. 143-158) Basil Blackwell, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; When teasing is unwelcome, it may be regarded as [[harassment]] or [[mobbing]], especially in the work place and school, or as a form of [[bullying]] or emotional [[abuse]]. If done in public, it may be regarded as [[humiliation]]. Teasing can also be regarded as educative when it is used as a way of  [[Informal learning]]. Adults in some of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American Communities]] often tease children to playfully illustrate and teach them how their behaviour negatively affects the community. Children in many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American Communities]] also learn by observing what others do in addition to collaborating with them. Along with teasing, this form of informal learning is different from the ways that Western American children learn. Informal ways of child learning include mutual responsibility, as well as active collaboration with adults and peers. This differentiates from the more formal way of learning because it is not adult-oriented.

People may be teased on matters such as their appearance, weight, behavior, abilities, clothing, and intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski, R. (2000). I was only kidding: Victim and perpetrators' perceptions of teasing. ''[[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]]'', ''26'', 231-241.&lt;/ref&gt; From the victim's point of view, this kind of teasing is often hurtful, irrespective of the intention of the teaser.

One may also tease an [[animal]]. Some animals, such as [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s, may recognize this both as play or harassment.

==The nature of teasing==
A common form of teasing is verbal bullying or [[taunt]]ing. This behavior is intended to distract, disturb, offend, sadden, anger, bother, irritate, or annoy the recipient. Because it is hurtful, it is different from joking and is generally accompanied by some degree of [[social rejection]]. Teasing can also be taken to mean "To make fun of; mock playfully" or be sarcastic about and use sarcasm.

[[Dacher Keltner]] utilizes Penelope Brown's classic study on the difference between "on-record" and "off-record" communication to illustrate how people must learn to read others' tone of voice and facial expressions in order to learn appropriate responses to teasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/magazine/07teasing-t.html|last=Keltner|first= Dacher|date=December 5, 2008|title=In defense of teasing|publisher= ''The New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A form of teasing that is usually overlooked is educational teasing. This form is commonly used by parents and caregivers in two [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American Communities]] and Mexican Heritage communities to guide their children into responding with more [[Prosocial behavior]]. For example, when a parent teases a child who is throwing a tantrum for a piece of candy, the parent will pretend to give the child candy but then take it away and ask the child to correct their behavior before giving the child that piece of candy. In this way, the parent teaches the child the importance of maintaining self-control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Peter|title=The Educative Value of Teasing|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201301/the-educative-value-teasing-0|publisher=Psychology Today|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When adults educate children through teasing, they are informally teaching the children. This type of learning is often overlooked because it is different from the way Western American Communities teach their children.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Another form of teasing is to pretend to give something which the other desires, or give it very slowly. This is usually done by arousing curiosity or desire, and may not actually involve the intent to satisfy or disclose. This form of teasing could be called "tantalizing", after the story of [[Tantalus]]. Tantalizing is generally playful among adults, although among children it can be hurtful, such as when one child acquires a possession of another's property and will not return it. It is also common in flirting and dating. For example, a man or woman who is interested in someone might reject an advance the first time in order to arouse interest and curiosity, and  give in the second or third time.

Whether teasing is playful or hurtful or educative is largely subject to the interpretation of the person being teased. If the person being teased feels harmed, then the teasing is hurtful. A difference in [[power (sociology)|power]] between people may also make the behavior hurtful rather than playful. Ultimately though, if someone perceives him or herself as the victim of teasing, and experiences the teasing as unpleasant, then it is considered hurtful. If parents' intentions are positive, as in many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American Communities]], then teasing to the community can be seen as an educational tool. The child may or may not understand that in the moment. If the other person continues to do it after being asked to stop then it is a form of bullying or abuse.

Another way to look at teasing is as an honest reflection on differences, expressed in a joking fashion with the goal of "clearing the air". It can express a comfort with the other which can be comforting. As opposed to being nice to someone's face while making disparaging remarks behind their back, teasing can be a way to express differences in a direct fashion rather than internalizing them.

==In indigenous American communities==

Some indigenous American communities use teasing to teach their children about the expectations and values of the community and to change negative behaviors. Teasing gives children a better understanding of how their behavior affects the people around them. Teasing in Indigenous American communities is used to learn community acceptance, humbleness, correcting a behavior and social control.

In some Mexican indigenous American communities, teasing is used in an effective educative way. Teasing is found more useful because it allows the child to feel and understand the relevant effect of their behavior instead of receiving out of context feedback. Some parents in Indigenous American communities believe it mildly embarrasses the children in a shared reference to give them a good sense of the consequences of their behavior. This type of teasing is thought to teach children to be less egocentric, teaches autonomy and responsibility to monitor their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silva|first=Katie|title=Teaching children through 'little dramas': Opinions about instructional ribbing from Mexican-heritage and European-American mothers.|journal=ProQuest, UMI Dissertations|date=2011|pages=1–66|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/926578064?accountid=14523|accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parental teasing also is practiced to encourage the child to think of their behavior in a social context. Some Indigenous American mothers have reported that this urges the children to understand how their behavior affects others around them. From examples in Eisenberg's article, parents use teasing as way of reinforcing relationships and participation in group/community activities ([[Prosocial behavior]]). Parents tease their children to be able to “control the behavior of the child and to have fun with them”.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, A. R. (1986). Teasing: Verbal play in two Mexicano homes. In B. B. Schieffelin &amp; E. Ochs (Eds.) Language socialization across cultures. (pp. 182-198). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Inuit]] principal of learning that follows a similar teasing pattern is known as issumaksaiyuk, meaning to cause thought. Oftentimes, adults pose questions or hypothetical situations to the children (sometimes dangerous) but in a teasing, playful manner, often dramatizing their responses. These questions raise the child's awareness to issues surrounding their community, as well as give them a sense of agency within the community as a member capable of having an effect and creating change. Once the child begins to answer the questions reasonably, like an adult, the questions would stop.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, J. (1998). ''Inuit morality play: The emotional education of a three-year-old''. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[Cherokee]] communities, teasing is a way of diffusing aggressive or hostile situations and teaching the individual about the consequences of their behavior. It allows the individual to feel how their behaviors are affecting others and control their behavior.

==Other usages==
To tease, or to "be a tease" in a [[Human sexuality|sexual]] sense can refer to the use of posture, language or other means of [[flirting]] to cause another person to become sexually aroused. Such teasing may or may not be a prelude to intercourse, an ambiguity which can lead to uncomfortable situations. In a more physical sense, it can also refer to [[sexual stimulation]].

Teasing is also used to describe playing part of a song at a concert. [[Jam band]]s will often quote the main riff of another song during jams.

"Tease it" is also used as a slang term to smoke marijuana. The word "tease" can also be used as a noun to stand for marijuana.

In a very different context, hair can be teased, "ratted", or more correctly, "[[backcombing|backcombed]]".  As the name suggests, backcombing involves combing the hair backwards from end to root to intentionally tangle the strands to create volume. It can also be done excessively in sections to create [[dreadlocks]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53588">The '''Theatre of the Absurd''' ({{lang-fr|théâtre de l'absurde}} {{IPA-fr|teɑtʁ(ə) də lapsyʁd|}}) is a post–World War II designation for particular [[Play (theatre)|plays]] of [[absurdist fiction]] written by a number of primarily European [[playwright]]s in the late 1950s, as well as one for the style of theatre which has evolved from their work. Their work focused largely on the idea of [[existentialism]] and expressed what happens when human existence has no meaning or purpose and therefore all communication breaks down.  Logical construction and argument gives way to irrational and illogical speech and to its ultimate conclusion, silence.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hutchinson Encyclopedia'', Millennium Edition, Helicon 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Critic [[Martin Esslin]] coined the term in his 1960 essay "Theatre of the Absurd".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Theatre of the Absurd |first=Martin |last=Esslin |year=1961 |oclc=329986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He related these plays based on a broad theme of the Absurd, similar to the way [[Albert Camus]] uses the term in his 1942 essay ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm |title=THE THEATRE OF THE ABSURD: THE WEST AND THE EAST |first=Jan |last=Culík |date=2000 |publisher=University of Glasgow |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823075755/http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm |archivedate=2009-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Absurd in these plays takes the form of man's reaction to a world apparently without meaning, or man as a puppet controlled or menaced by invisible outside forces. This style of writing was first popularized by the Samuel Beckett play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' (1953). Although the term is applied to a wide range of plays, some characteristics coincide in many of the plays: broad comedy, often similar to [[vaudeville]], mixed with horrific or tragic images; characters caught in hopeless situations forced to do repetitive or meaningless actions; dialogue full of clichés, wordplay, and nonsense; plots that are cyclical or absurdly expansive; either a parody or dismissal of [[Theatrical realism|realism]] and the concept of the "[[well-made play]]". These plays were shaped by the political turmoil, scientific breakthrough, and social upheaval going on in the world around the playwrights during these times.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

While absurdists believed that life is absurd, they also believed that death and the "after life" were equally absurd if not more, and that whether people live or not all of their actions are pointless and everything will lead to the same end (hence the repetitiveness in many of these absurdist plays).{{fact|date=September 2018}}

In his book ''Absurd Drama'' (1965), Esslin wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;... the Theatre of the Absurd attacks the comfortable certainties of religious or political orthodoxy. It aims to shock its audience out of complacency, to bring it face to face with the harsh facts of the human situation as these writers see it. But the challenge behind this message is anything but one of despair. It is a challenge to accept the human condition as it is, in all its mystery and absurdity, and to bear it with dignity, nobly, responsibly; precisely {{em|because}} there are no easy solutions to the mysteries of existence, because ultimately man is alone in a meaningless world. The shedding of easy solutions, of comforting illusions, may be painful, but it leaves behind it a sense of freedom and relief. And that is why, in the last resort, the Theatre of the Absurd does not provoke tears of despair but the laughter of liberation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Playwrights commonly associated with the Theatre of the Absurd include [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Jean Genet]], [[Arthur Adamov]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[Tom Stoppard]], [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], [[Miguel Mihura]], [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]], [[Fernando Arrabal]], [[Václav Havel]], [[Edward Albee]], [[Malay Roy Choudhury]], [[Tadeusz Różewicz]], [[Sławomir Mrożek]], [[N.F. Simpson]], and [[Badal Sarkar]].{{fact|date=September 2018}}

== Origin ==
In the first edition of ''The Theatre of the Absurd'', Esslin saw the work of these playwrights as giving artistic meaning to [[Albert Camus]]'s philosophy that life is inherently without meaning, as illustrated in his work ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''. In the first (1961) edition, Esslin presented the four defining playwrights of the movement as [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Arthur Adamov]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], and [[Jean Genet]], and in subsequent editions he added a fifth playwright, [[Harold Pinter]]—although each of these writers has unique preoccupations and characteristics that go beyond the term "absurd."&lt;ref name=Esslin1961ed&gt;Martin Esslin, ''The Theatre of the Absurd'' (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1961). (Subsequent references to this ed. appear within parentheses in the text.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Esslin2004ed&gt;Martin Esslin, ''The Theatre of the Absurd'', 3rd ed. (New York: Vintage [Knopf], 2004). (Subsequent references to this ed. appear within parentheses in the text.)&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers associated with this group by Esslin and other critics include [[Tom Stoppard]],&lt;ref&gt;Terry Hodgson. ''The plays of Tom Stoppard: for stage, radio, TV and film''.Palgrave Macmillan, 2001. {{ISBN|1-84046-241-8}}, {{ISBN|978-1-84046-241-8}}.pg.181.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]],&lt;ref&gt;Joel Agee.

== Significant precursors ==
Though the label "Theatre of the Absurd" covers a wide variety of playwrights with differing styles, they do have some common stylistic precursors (Esslin [1961]). These precursors include Elizabethan tragicomedy, formal experimentation, pataphysics, surrealism, Dadaism, and most importantly existentialism.

=== Elizabethan – tragicomedy ===
The mode of most "absurdist" plays is [[tragicomedy]].&lt;ref name="Esslin, pg. 323-324"&gt;Esslin, pg. 323–324&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Styan. ''Modern Drama in Theory and Practice''. Cambridge University Press, 1983 {{ISBN|0-521-29629-3}}, pg. 125&lt;/ref&gt; As Nell says in ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]'', "Nothing is funnier than unhappiness … it's the most comical thing in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Beckett. ''Endgame: a play in one act, followed by Act without words, a mime for one player''. Grove Press, 1958. {{ISBN|0-8021-5024-1}}. pg. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Esslin cites [[William Shakespeare]] as an influence on this aspect of the "Absurd drama."&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 321–323&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare's influence is acknowledged directly in the titles of Ionesco's ''[[Macbett]]'' and Stoppard's ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]''. Friedrich Dürrenmatt says in his essay "Problems of the Theatre", "Comedy alone is suitable for us … But the tragic is still possible even if pure tragedy is not.  We can achieve the tragic out of comedy.  We can bring it forth as a frightening moment, as an abyss that opens suddenly; indeed, many of Shakespeare's tragedies are already really comedies out of which the tragic arises."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Dürrenmatt. "Problems of the Theatre". ''The Marriage of Mr. Mississippi''. Grove Press, 1964. {{ISBN|978-0-394-17198-2}}. pg. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though layered with a significant amount of tragedy, the Theatre of the Absurd echoes other great forms of comedic performance, according to Esslin, from [[Commedia dell'arte]] to [[vaudeville]].&lt;ref name="Esslin, pg. 323-324" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Styan, pg. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Esslin cites early film comedians and [[music hall]] artists such as [[Charlie Chaplin]], the [[Keystone Cops]] and [[Buster Keaton]] as direct influences. (Keaton even starred in Beckett's ''[[Film (film)|Film]]'' in 1965.)&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 325&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formal experimentation ===
As an experimental form of theatre, many Theatre of the Absurd playwrights employ techniques borrowed from earlier innovators. Writers and techniques frequently mentioned in relation to the Theatre of the Absurd include the 19th-century nonsense poets, such as [[Lewis Carroll]] or [[Edward Lear]];&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 330–331&lt;/ref&gt; Polish playwright [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz]];&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 382–385&lt;/ref&gt; the Russians [[Daniil Kharms]],&lt;ref&gt;Neil Cornwell. ''The absurd in literature.'' Manchester University Press ND, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7190-7410-X}}. pg. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikolai Erdman]],&lt;ref&gt;John Freedman. ''The major plays of Nikolai Erdman: The warrant and The suicide''. Routledge, 1995.{{ISBN|3718655837}}. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; and others; [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s [[Distancing effect|distancing]] techniques in his "[[Epic theatre]]";&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 365–368&lt;/ref&gt; and the "dream plays" of [[August Strindberg]].&lt;ref name="Esslin1961ed" /&gt;&lt;ref name = StyanDark&gt;J. L. Styan. ''The dark comedy: the development of modern comic tragedy.'' Cambridge University Press, 1968. {{ISBN|0-521-09529-8}}. pg. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--needs page numbers in citations throughout--&gt;

One commonly cited precursor is [[Luigi Pirandello]], especially ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]''.&lt;ref name = StyanDark /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annette J. Saddik. Ed. "Experimental Innovations After the Second World War". ''Contemporary American Drama''.Edinburgh University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|0-7486-2494-5}}.pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Pirandello was a highly regarded theatrical experimentalist who wanted to bring down the [[fourth wall]] presupposed by the [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] of playwrights such as [[Henrik Ibsen]].&lt;!--Page number references to citations needed throughout.--&gt; According to [[W. B. Worthen]], ''Six Characters'' and other Pirandello plays use "[[Metatheatre]]—[[roleplaying]], [[Play within a play|plays-within-plays]], and a flexible sense of the limits of stage and illusion—to examine a highly-theatricalized vision of [[Personal identity|identity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Worthen, pg. 702&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influential playwright was [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] whose ''[[The Breasts of Tiresias]]'' was the first work to be called "[[Surrealism|surreal]]".&lt;ref name = Lewis260&gt;Allan Lewis. "The Theatre of the 'Absurd' – Beckett, Ionesco, Genet". ''The Contemporary Theatre: The Significant Playwrights of Our Time''. Crown Publishers, 1966. pg. 260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Glasgow&gt;Rupert D. V. Glasgow. ''Madness, Masks, and Laughter: An Essay on Comedy''. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-8386-3559-8}}. pg. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah B. Gaensbauer. ''The French theater of the absurd''. Twayne Publishers, 1991. {{ISBN|0-8057-8270-2}}. pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pataphysics, surrealism, and Dadaism ===
One of the most significant common precursors is [[Alfred Jarry]] whose wild, irreverent, and lascivious ''Ubu'' plays scandalized Paris in the 1890s. Likewise, the concept of [['pataphysics]]—"the science of imaginary solutions"—first presented in Jarry's ''Gestes et opinions du docteur Faustroll, pataphysicien'' (''[[Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, pataphysician]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Jill Fell. ''Alfred Jarry, an imagination in revolt''. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-8386-4007-9}}. pg. 53&lt;/ref&gt; was inspirational to many later Absurdists,&lt;ref name="Glasgow" /&gt; some of whom joined the Collège de 'pataphysique, founded in honor of Jarry in 1948&lt;ref name="Lewis260" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pag. 346–348&lt;/ref&gt; (Ionesco,&lt;ref name = Queneau&gt;Raymond Queneau, Marc Lowenthal. ''Stories &amp; remarks''.U of Nebraska Press, 2000
{{ISBN|0-8032-8852-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-8852-2}}. pg. ix–x&lt;/ref&gt; Arrabal, and Vian&lt;ref name="Queneau" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Bellos. ''Georges Perec: a life in words : a biography''. David R. Godine Publisher, 1993. {{ISBN|0-87923-980-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87923-980-0}}. pg.596&lt;/ref&gt; were given the title Transcendent Satrape of the Collège de 'pataphysique). The Alfred Jarry Theatre, founded by [[Antonin Artaud]] and [[Roger Vitrac]], housed several Absurdist plays, including ones by Ionesco and Adamov.&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 373.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, pg.170&lt;/ref&gt;

Artaud's "[[Theatre of Cruelty|The Theatre of Cruelty]]" (presented in ''[[Theatre and its Double|The Theatre and Its Double]]'') was a particularly important philosophical treatise. Artaud claimed theatre's reliance on literature was inadequate and that the true power of theatre was in its visceral impact.&lt;ref&gt;Antonin Artaud ''The Theatre and Its Double''.  Tr. Mary Caroline Richards.  New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1958., pg. 15–133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Styan, ''Modern'' pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saddik, pg. 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Artaud was a [[Surrealism|Surrealist]], and many other members of the Surrealist group were significant influences on the Absurdists.&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 372–375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gussow. ''Theatre on the edge: new visions, new voices''. Hal Leonard Corporation, 1998. {{ISBN|1-55783-311-7}}. pg. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eli Rozik. ''The roots of theatre: rethinking ritual and other theories of origin''. University of Iowa Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-87745-817-0}}. pg. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

Absurdism is also frequently compared to Surrealism's predecessor, [[Dadaism]] (for example, the Dadaist plays by [[Tristan Tzara]] performed at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] in Zürich).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Drain. ''Twentieth-century theatre: a sourcebook''. Routledge, 1995. {{ISBN|0-415-09619-7}}. pg. 5–7, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Absurdists had direct connections with the Dadaists and Surrealists. Ionesco,&lt;ref&gt;Eugène Ionesco. ''Present past, past present: a personal memoir''.

=== Relationship with existentialism ===

Many of the Absurdists were contemporaries with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], the philosophical spokesman for existentialism in Paris, but few Absurdists actually committed to Sartre's own existentialist philosophy, as expressed in ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', and many of the Absurdists had a complicated relationship with him.  Sartre praised Genet's plays, stating that for Genet, "Good is only an illusion. Evil is a Nothingness which arises upon the ruins of Good".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre. "Introduction to ''The Maids; and Deathwatch''" ''The Maids; and Deathwatch''. Grove Press, 1962. {{ISBN|0-8021-5056-X}}. pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ionesco, however, hated Sartre bitterly.&lt;ref&gt;Eugène Ionesco. ''Present Past, Past Present''. Da Capo Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-306-80835-8}}. pg. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Ionesco accused Sartre of supporting Communism but ignoring the atrocities committed by Communists; he wrote ''[[Rhinoceros (play)|Rhinoceros]]'' as a criticism of blind conformity, whether it be to Nazism or Communism; at the end of the play, one man remains on Earth resisting transformation into a rhinoceros&lt;ref&gt;Eugène Ionesco. ''Fragments of a Journal''. Tr. Jean Stewart. London: Faber and Faber, 1968. pg. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosette C. Lamont. ''Ionesco's imperatives: the politics of culture''. University of Michigan Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-472-10310-5}}. pg. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sartre criticized ''Rhinoceros'' by questioning: "Why is there one man who resists? At least we could learn why, but no, we learn not even that. He resists because he is there".&lt;ref&gt;"Beyond Bourgeois Theatre" 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, pg. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sartre's criticism highlights a primary difference between the Theatre of the Absurd and existentialism: the Theatre of the Absurd shows the failure of man without recommending a solution.&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, pg. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1966 interview, [[Claude Bonnefoy]], comparing the Absurdists to Sartre and Camus, said to Ionesco, "It seems to me that Beckett, Adamov and yourself started out less from philosophical reflections or a return to classical sources, than from first-hand experience and a desire to find a new theatrical expression that would enable you to render this experience in all its acuteness and also its immediacy. If Sartre and Camus thought out these themes, you expressed them in a far more vital contemporary fashion". Ionesco replied, "I have the feeling that these writers – who are serious and important – were talking about absurdity and death, but that they never really lived these themes, that they did not feel them within themselves in an almost irrational, visceral way, that all this was not deeply inscribed in their language. With them it was still rhetoric, eloquence. With Adamov and Beckett it really is a very naked reality that is conveyed through the apparent dislocation of language".&lt;ref&gt;Claude Bonnefoy. ''Conversations with Eugène Ionesco''. Trans. Jan Dawson. Holt, Rinehard and Winston, 1971. pg. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to Sartre's concepts of the function of literature, [[Samuel Beckett]]'s primary focus was on the ''failure'' of man to overcome "absurdity" - or the repetition of life even though the end result will be the same no matter what and everything is essentially pointless - as James Knowlson says in ''Damned to Fame'', Beckett's work focuses, "on poverty, failure, exile and loss — as he put it, on man as a 'non-knower' and as a 'non-can-er'&amp;nbsp;."&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson, pg. 319&lt;/ref&gt;  Beckett's own relationship with Sartre was complicated by a mistake made in the publication of one of his stories in Sartre's journal ''[[Les Temps Modernes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson, pg. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett said, though he liked ''[[Nausea (novel)|Nausea]]'', he generally found the writing style of Sartre and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] to be "too philosophical" and he considered himself "not a philosopher".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Cronin, Isaac Cronin. ''Samuel Beckett: the last modernist''. Da Capo Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-306-80898-6}}. pg. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The "Absurd" or "New Theater" movement was originally a Paris-based (and a [[Rive Gauche]]) avant-garde phenomenon tied to extremely small theaters in the [[Quartier Latin]].  Some of the Absurdists, such as [[Jean Genet]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter Norrish. ''New tragedy and comedy in France, 1945–1970''.Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1988. {{ISBN|0-389-20746-2}}. pg. 107&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Tardieu]],&lt;ref name = Hardison438&gt;Felicia Hardison Londré, Margot Berthold.

In England some of those whom Esslin considered practitioners of the Theatre of the Absurd include [[Harold Pinter]],&lt;ref name="Hardison438" /&gt; [[Tom Stoppard]],&lt;ref&gt;Gabrielle H.

=== Legacy ===
Echoes of elements of "The Theatre of the Absurd" can be seen in the work of many later playwrights, from more [[avant-garde]] or experimental playwrights like [[Suzan-Lori Parks]]—in ''[[The Death of the Last Black Man in the Whole Entire World]]'' and ''[[The America Play]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Enoch Brater. "After the Absurd". ''Around the Absurd: Essays on Modern and Postmodern Drama''. Ed. Enoch Brater and Ruby Cohn. University of Michigan Press, 1990. {{ISBN|978-0-472-10205-1}}. pg. 293–301.&lt;/ref&gt; for example—to relatively realistic playwrights like [[David Mamet]]—in ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]]'', which Mamet dedicated to [[Harold Pinter]].&lt;ref&gt;David Mamet.

In addition, the absurd drama has also found its way in [[Urdu literature]], ''Mazaron Ke Phool'' [i.e. Graveyard Flowers] (2008) by contemporary Pakistani writer, poet and columnist Mujtaba Haider Zaidi is the first absurd drama in the history of Urdu literature. Created in the pattern of ancient Greek tragedies, the drama contains only two characters, and carries both poetry and prose in it, and hence fulfills all the requirements necessary for a perfect Absurd drama.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== Theatrical features ==
Plays within this group are absurd in that they focus not on logical acts, realistic occurrences, or traditional character development; they, instead, focus on human beings trapped in an incomprehensible world subject to any occurrence, no matter how illogical.&lt;ref&gt;Styan, ''Dark'' 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saddik, pg. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norrish, pg. 2–8.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theme of incomprehensibility is coupled with the inadequacy of language to form meaningful human connections.&lt;ref name="Lewis260" /&gt; According to Martin Esslin, Absurdism is "the inevitable devaluation of ideals, purity, and purpose"&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  Absurdist drama asks its viewer to "draw his own conclusions, make his own errors".&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Though Theatre of the Absurd may be seen as nonsense, they have something to say and can be understood".&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Esslin makes a distinction between the dictionary definition of absurd ("out of harmony" in the musical sense) and drama's understanding of the Absurd: "Absurd is that which is devoid of purpose... Cut off from his religious, metaphysical, and transcendental roots, man is lost; all his actions become senseless, absurd, useless".&lt;ref&gt;Ionesco in Esslin, pg. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Characters ===
The characters in Absurdist drama are lost and floating in an incomprehensible universe and they abandon rational devices and discursive thought because these approaches are inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Richardson 1154&lt;/ref&gt; Many characters appear as automatons stuck in routines speaking only in cliché (Ionesco called the Old Man and Old Woman in ''[[Les Chaises|The Chairs]]'' "uber-marrionettes").&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, pg. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scope.nottingham.ac.uk/article.php?id=85&amp;issue=3|title=Open access journal for Film and Television Studies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters are frequently stereotypical, [[archetype|archetypal]], or flat character types as in [[Commedia dell'arte]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Cronin, Isaac Cronin. ''Samuel Beckett: the last modernist''. Da Capo Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-306-80898-6}}. pg. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dave Bradby. ''Modern French Drama: 1940–1990''. Cambridge University Press, 1991. {{ISBN|0-521-40843-1}}. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Esslin402&gt;Esslin, pg. 402&lt;/ref&gt;

The more complex characters are in crisis because the world around them is incomprehensible.&lt;ref name ="Esslin402" /&gt;  Many of Pinter's plays, for example, feature characters trapped in an enclosed space menaced by some force the character can't understand. Pinter's first play was ''[[The Room (play)|The Room]]'' – in which the main character, Rose, is menaced by Riley who invades her safe space though the actual source of menace remains a mystery&lt;ref&gt;Katherine H. Burkman. ''The dramatic world of Harold Pinter: its basis in ritual''. Ohio State University Press, 1971 {{ISBN|0-8142-0146-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8142-0146-6}}. pg. 70–73.&lt;/ref&gt; – and this theme of characters in a safe space menaced by an outside force is repeated in many of his later works (perhaps most famously in ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]''). In [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]]'s ''The Visit'' the main character, Alfred, is menaced by Claire Zachanassian; Claire, richest woman in the world with a decaying body and multiple husbands throughout the play, has guaranteed a payout for anyone in the town willing to kill Alfred.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Alan Crockett. ''Understanding Friedrich Dürrenmatt''.Univ of South Carolina Press, 1998. {{ISBN|1-57003-213-0}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57003-213-4}}. pg.81&lt;/ref&gt; Characters in Absurdist drama may also face the chaos of a world that science and logic have abandoned. Ionesco's recurring character Berenger, for example, faces a killer without motivation in ''[[Tueur sans gages|The Killer]]'', and Berenger's logical arguments fail to convince the killer that killing is wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Cabell Pronko. ''Avant-garde: the experimental theater in France''. University of California Press, 1966. pg. 96–102.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Rhinoceros (play)|Rhinocéros]]'', Berenger remains the only human on Earth who hasn’t turned into a rhinoceros and must decide whether or not to conform.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom. ''Bloom's Major Dramatists: Eugène Ionesco''. 2003. Infobase Publishing. p106-110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Heilman. ''The Ghost on the Ramparts''. University of Georgia Press, 2008 {{ISBN|0-8203-3265-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8203-3265-9}}. pg. 170–171.&lt;/ref&gt; Characters may find themselves trapped in a routine, or in a metafictional conceit, trapped in a story; the title characters in [[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]'', for example, find themselves in a story (''[[Hamlet]]'') in which the outcome has already been written.&lt;ref name = Bradby59&gt;Bradby, ''Modern'' pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victor L. Cahn. ''Beyond Absurdity: The Plays of Tom Stoppard''. London: Associated University Presses, 1979. pg. 36–39. Cahn asserts that though Stoppard begain writing in the Absurdist mode, in his increasing focus on order, optimism, and the redemptive power of art, Stoppard has moved "beyond" Absurdism, as the title implies.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plots of many Absurdist plays feature characters in interdependent pairs, commonly either two males or a male and a female. Some Beckett scholars call this the "pseudocouple".&lt;ref&gt;Ackerley, pg. 334, 465, 508&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Astro. ''Understanding Samuel Beckett''. Univ of South Carolina Press, 1990
{{ISBN|0-87249-686-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87249-686-6}}. pg. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The two characters may be roughly equal or have a begrudging interdependence (like Vladimir and Estragon in ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''&lt;ref name="Bradby59" /&gt; or the two main characters in ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]''); one character may be clearly dominant and may torture the passive character (like Pozzo and Lucky in ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' or Hamm and Clov in ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]''); the relationship of the characters may shift dramatically throughout the play (as in Ionesco's ''[[La Leçon|The Lesson]]''&lt;ref name = Hinden401&gt;Hinden, pg. 401.&lt;/ref&gt; or in many of Albee's plays, ''[[The Zoo Story]]''&lt;ref name = Kane159&gt;Leslie Kane. ''The language of silence: on the unspoken and the unspeakable in modern drama''. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1984. {{ISBN|0-8386-3187-8}}. pg. 159–160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa M. Siefker Bailey, Bruce J. Mann. ''Edward Albee: A Casebook''. 2003. Routledge. pg. 33–44.&lt;/ref&gt; for example).

=== Language ===
Despite its reputation for nonsense language, much of the dialogue in Absurdist plays is naturalistic.  The moments when characters resort to nonsense language or clichés—when words appear to have lost their denotative function, thus creating misunderstanding among the characters—make the Theatre of the Absurd distinctive.&lt;ref name="Lewis260" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Language frequently gains a certain phonetic, rhythmical, almost musical quality, opening up a wide range of often comedic playfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Albee, Philip C. Kolin. ''Conversations with Edward Albee''. Univ. Press of Mississippi, 1988. {{ISBN|0-87805-342-5}}. pg. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jean Tardieu]], for example, in the series of short pieces ''Theatre de Chambre'' arranged the language as one arranges music.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Cabell Pronko. ''Avant-Garde''. University of California Press, 2003. pg.155–156&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctively Absurdist language ranges from meaningless clichés to vaudeville-style word play to meaningless nonsense.&lt;ref name="Hinden401" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeanette R. Malkin. ''Verbal Violence in Contemporary Drama: From Handke to Shepard''. Cambridge University Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0-521-38335-8}}. pg. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Bald Soprano'', for example, was inspired by a language book in which characters would exchange empty clichés that never ultimately amounted to true communication or true connection.&lt;ref&gt;Styan, ''Dark'' pg. 221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erich Segal. ''The Death of Comedy''. Harvard University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-01247-X}} pg. 422.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the characters in ''The Bald Soprano''—like many other Absurdist characters—go through routine dialogue full of clichés without actually communicating anything substantive or making a human connection.&lt;ref&gt;Saddik, pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guido Almansi, Simon Henderson. ''Harold Pinter''. Routledge, 1983. {{ISBN|0-416-31710-3}}. pg. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the dialogue is purposefully elliptical; the language of Absurdist Theater becomes secondary to the poetry of the concrete and objectified images of the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, pg. 17, 19&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of Beckett's plays devalue language for the sake of the striking tableau.&lt;ref&gt;Saddik, pg. 32&lt;/ref&gt;  Harold Pinter—famous for his "Pinter pause"—presents more subtly elliptical dialogue; often the primary things characters should address are replaced by ellipsis or dashes.  The following exchange between Aston and Davies in ''[[The Caretaker]]'' is typical of Pinter:

:ASTON. More or less exactly what you...
:DAVIES.  That's it … that's what I'm getting at is … I mean, what sort of jobs … (''Pause''.)
:ASTON. Well, there's things like the stairs … and the … the bells …
:DAVIES. But it'd be a matter … wouldn't it … it'd be a matter of a broom … isn't it?&lt;ref&gt;Harold Pinter. ''The Caretaker''. DPS, 1991.{{ISBN|0822201844}}, pg. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the dialogue in Absurdist drama (especially in Beckett's and Albee's plays, for example) reflects this kind of evasiveness and inability to make a connection.&lt;ref name="Kane159" /&gt;  When language that is apparently nonsensical appears, it also demonstrates this disconnection.  It can be used for comic effect, as in Lucky's long speech in ''Godot'' when Pozzo says Lucky is demonstrating a talent for "thinking" as other characters comically attempt to stop him:

:LUCKY.  Given the existence as uttered forth in the public works of Puncher and Wattmann of a personal God quaquaquaqua with white beard quaquaquaqua outside time without extension who from the heights of divine apathia divine athambia divine aphasia loves us dearly with some exceptions for reasons unknown but time will tell and suffers like the divine Miranda with those who for reasons unknown but time will tell are plunged in torment...&lt;ref&gt;David Bradby. ''Beckett, Waiting for Godot''. Camberidge University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-521-59510-X}}, pg. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonsense may also be used abusively, as in Pinter's ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'' when Goldberg and McCann torture Stanley with apparently nonsensical questions and [[non sequitur (humor)|non-sequiturs]]:

:GOLDBERG.  What do you use for pajamas?
:STANLEY.  Nothing.
:GOLDBERG.  You verminate the sheet of your birth.
:MCCANN.  What about the Albigensenist heresy?
:GOLDBERG.  Who watered the wicket in Melbourne?
:MCCANN.  What about the blessed Oliver Plunkett?
:GOLDBERG.  Speak up Webber.  Why did the chicken cross the road?&lt;ref&gt;Harold Pinter. ''The Birthday Party and The Room: Two Plays''. Grove Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-8021-5114-0}}. pg. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the above examples, nonsense in Absurdist theatre may be also used to demonstrate the limits of language while questioning or parodying the determinism of science and the knowability of truth.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Williams. "''The Birthday Party'': Harold Pinter". ''Modern Critical Views: Harold Pinter''. New York: Chelsea House Publishers, 1987. {{ISBN|0-87754-706-8}}. pg. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc Silverstein. ''Harold Pinter and the language of cultural power''. Bucknell University Press, 1993 {{ISBN|0-8387-5236-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8387-5236-4}}. pg. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hornby. ''Drama, Metadrama and perception''. Associated University Presse, 1986 {{ISBN|0-8387-5101-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8387-5101-5}}. pg. 61–63.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Ionesco's ''The Lesson'', a professor tries to force a pupil to understand his nonsensical philology lesson:

:PROFESSOR.  … In Spanish: the roses of my grandmother are as yellow as my grandfather who is Asiatic; in Latin: the roses of my grandmother are as yellow as my grandfather who is Asiatic.  Do you detect the difference?  Translate this into … Romanian
:PUPIL.  The … how do you say "roses" in Romanian?
:PROFESSOR.  But "roses", what else? … "roses" is a translation in Oriental of the French word "roses", in Spanish "roses", do you get it? In Sardanapali, "roses"...&lt;ref&gt;Eugène Ionesco. ''The Bald Soprano and Other Plays''. Grove Press, 1982. {{ISBN|0-8021-3079-8}}. pg. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plot ===
Traditional plot structures are rarely a consideration in The Theatre of the Absurd.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Schumacher. ''Encyclopedia of Literature &amp; Criticism''. 1990. Routledge. pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Plots can consist of the absurd repetition of cliché and routine, as in ''Godot'' or ''[[The Bald Soprano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Homan. ''Beckett's theaters: interpretations for performance''. Bucknell University Press, 1984. {{ISBN|0-8387-5064-8}}. pg. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;  Often there is a menacing outside force that remains a mystery; in ''The Birthday Party'', for example, Goldberg and McCann confront Stanley, torture him with absurd questions, and drag him off at the end, but it is never revealed why.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, pg. 132, 134&lt;/ref&gt; In later Pinter plays, such as ''The Caretaker''&lt;ref&gt;Katherine H. Burkman. ''The dramatic world of Harold Pinter: its basis in ritual''. Ohio State University Press, 1971. {{ISBN|0-8142-0146-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8142-0146-6}}. pg. 76–89&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Homecoming'',&lt;ref&gt;Marc Silverstein. ''Harold Pinter and the language of cultural power''. Bucknell University Press, 1993.{{ISBN|0-8387-5236-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8387-5236-4}}. pg. 76–94.&lt;/ref&gt; the menace is no longer entering from the outside but exists within the confined space. Other Absurdists use this kind of plot, as in Edward Albee's ''[[A Delicate Balance (play)|A Delicate Balance]]'': Harry and Edna take refuge at the home of their friends Agnes and Tobias because they suddenly become frightened.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen James Bottoms. ''The Cambridge Companion to Edward Albee''. Cambridge University Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-521-83455-4}}. pg. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;  They have difficulty explaining what has frightened them:

:HARRY: There was nothing … but we were very scared.
:EDNA: We … were … terrified.
:HARRY: We were scared.  It was like being lost: very young again, with the dark, and lost.  There was no … thing … to be … frightened of, but …
:EDNA: WE WERE FRIGHTENED … AND THERE WAS NOTHING.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Albee. ''A delicate balance: a play in three acts''. Samuel French, Inc., 1994. {{ISBN|0-573-60792-3}}. pg. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Absence, emptiness, nothingness, and unresolved mysteries are central features in many Absurdist plots:&lt;ref&gt;Les Essif. ''Empty figure on an empty stage: the theatre of Samuel Beckett and his generation''. Indiana University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-253-33847-6}}. pg. 1–9&lt;/ref&gt; for example, in ''The Chairs'' an old couple welcomes a large number of guests to their home, but these guests are invisible so all we see is empty chairs, a representation of their absence.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Rayner. ''Ghosts: death's double and the phenomena of theatre''. U of Minnesota Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0-8166-4544-2}}. pg. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the action of ''Godot'' is centered around the absence of a man named Godot, for whom the characters perpetually wait.  In many of Beckett's later plays, most features are stripped away and what's left is a minimalistic tableau: a woman walking slowly back and forth in ''[[Footfalls]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Morris Beja, S. E. Gontarski, Pierre A. G. Astier. ''Samuel Beckett—humanistic perspectives''.Ohio State University Press, 1983. {{ISBN|0-8142-0334-5}}. pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt; for example, or in ''[[Breath (play)|Breath]]'' only a junk heap on stage and the sounds of breathing.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Astro. ''Understanding Samuel Beckett''. Univ of South Carolina Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-87249-686-4}}. pg. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruby Cohn. ''A Beckett Canon''. University of Michigan Press, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-472-11190-9}} pg. 298, 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot may also revolve around an unexplained metamorphosis, a supernatural change, or a shift in the laws of physics.  For example, in Ionesco's ''[[Amédée ou comment s'en débarrasser|Amédée, or How to Get Rid of It]]'', a couple must deal with a corpse that is steadily growing larger and larger; Ionesco never fully reveals the identity of the corpse, how this person died, or why it's continually growing, but the corpse ultimately – and, again, without explanation – floats away.&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, pg. 101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justin Wintle. ''The Makers of Modern Culture''. Routledge, 2002. {{ISBN|0-415-26583-5}}. pg. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jean Tardieu's "The Keyhole" a lover watches a woman through a keyhole as she removes her clothes and then her flesh.&lt;ref&gt;Pronko, pg. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Pirandello, many Absurdists use meta-theatrical techniques to explore role fulfillment, fate, and the theatricality of theatre.  This is true for many of Genet's plays: for example, in ''The Maids'', two maids pretend to be their mistress; in ''The Balcony'' brothel patrons take on elevated positions in role-playing games, but the line between theatre and reality starts to blur.  Another complex example of this is ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead]]'': it's a play about two minor characters in ''[[Hamlet]]''; these characters, in turn, have various encounters with the players who perform ''The Mousetrap'', the play-within-the-play in ''Hamlet''.&lt;ref name="Bradby59" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;June Schlueter. ''Metafictional Characters in Modern Drama''. Columbia University Press, 1979. {{ISBN|0-231-04752-5}}. pg. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; In Stoppard's ''Travesties'', James Joyce and Tristan Tzara slip in and out of the plot of ''The Importance of Being Earnest''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter K. W. Tan, Tom Stoppard. ''A stylistics of drama: with special focus on Stoppard's Travesties''. NUS Press, 1993. {{ISBN|9971-69-182-5}}, {{ISBN|978-9971-69-182-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plots are frequently cyclical:&lt;ref name="Hinden401" /&gt; for example, ''Endgame'' begins where the play ended&lt;ref&gt;Katherine H. Burkman. ''Myth and ritual in the plays of Samuel Beckett''. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1987. {{ISBN|0-8386-3299-8}}. pg. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; – at the beginning of the play, Clov says, "Finished, it's finished, nearly finished, it must be nearly finished"&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Beckett. ''Endgame: a play in one act, followed by Act without words, a mime for one player''.Grove Press, 1958. {{ISBN|0-8021-5024-1}}. pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; – and themes of cycle, routine, and repetition are explored throughout.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Karpati Kennedy|Andrew K. Kennedy]]. ''Samuel Beckett''. Cambridge University Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-521-27488-5}}. pg. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In physics, the '''total position-spread (TPS)''' [[tensor]] is a quantity originally introduced in the modern theory of [[electrical conductivity]]. In the case of molecular systems, this tensor measures the fluctuation of the electrons around their mean positions, which corresponds to the delocalization of the electronic charge within a molecular system. The TPS can discriminate between metals and insulators taking information from the ground state [[wave function]]. This quantity can be very useful as an indicator to characterize [[Intervalence charge transfer]] processes, the bond nature of molecules (covalent, ionic or weakly bonded), and [[Metal–insulator transition]].

==Overview==

The Localization Tensor (LT) is a ''per electron'' quantity proposed in the context of the theory of [[Walter Kohn|Kohn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=W. Kohn |title=Theory of the Insulating State |journal=Phys. Rev. |volume=133 |issue= 1A |pages=A171–A181 |year= 1964|pmid= |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.133.A171|bibcode = 1964PhRv..133..171K }}&lt;/ref&gt; to characterize electrical conductivity properties. In 1964, Kohn realized that electrical conductivity is more related to the proper delocalization of the wave function than a simple band gap. In fact, he proposed that a qualitative difference between [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]] and [[Electrical conductor|conductors]] also manifests as a different organization of the electrons in their ground state where one has that: the wave function is strongly localized in insulators and very delocalized in conductors.

The interesting outcome of this theory is: ''i)'' it relates the classical idea of localized electrons as a cause of insulating state; ''ii)'' the needed information can be recovered from the ground state wave function because in the insulated regime the wave function breaks down as a sum of disconnected terms.

It is until 1999 that Resta and coworkers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=R. Resta |author2=S. Sorella |title=Electron Localization in the Insulating State |journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |volume=82 |issue= 2 |pages=370 |year= 1999|pmid= |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.82.370|arxiv = cond-mat/9808151 |bibcode = 1999PhRvL..82..370R }}&lt;/ref&gt; found a way to define the Kohn delocalization by proposing the already mentioned Localization Tensor. The LT is defined as a second order moment cumulant of the position operator divided by the number of electrons in the system. The key property of the LT is that: it diverges for metals while it takes finite values for insulators in the [[Thermodynamic limit]].

Recently, the global quantity (the LT not divided by the number of electrons) has been introduced to study molecules and named Total Position-Spread tensor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=O. Brea |author2=M. El Khatib |author3=C. Angeli |author4=G.L. Bendazzoli |author5=S. Evangelisti |author6=T. Leininger |title=Behavior of the Position–Spread Tensor in Diatomic Systems |journal=J. Chem. Theory Comput.  |volume=9 |issue= 12 |pages=5286–5295 |year= 2013|pmid= 26592266|doi=10.1021/ct400453b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==

=== Spin-summed TPS, (SS-TPS) ===
The total position spread '''Λ''' is defined as the second [[Moment (physics)|moment]] [[cumulant]] of the total electron [[position operator]], and its units are in length square (e.g. bohr²). In order to compute this quantity, one has to take into account the position operator and its tensorial square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. El Khatib |author2=T. Leininger |author3=G. L. Bendazzoli |author4=S. Evangelisti |title=Computing the Position-Spread Tensor in the CAS-SCF formalism |journal=Chem. Phys. Lett. |volume=591 |issue= 2 |pages=58 |year= 2014|pmid= |doi=10.1016/j.cplett.2013.10.080|bibcode = 2014CPL...591...58E }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a system of ''n'' electrons, the position operator and its Cartesian components are defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{r}} = \sum_{i=1}^n \hat{r}_i&lt;/math&gt; (total position)

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n \hat{x}_i \qquad \hat{y} = \sum_{i=1}^n \hat{y}_i     \qquad  \hat{z} = \sum_{i=1}^n \hat{z}_i \qquad&lt;/math&gt;

Where the ''i''  index runs over the number of electrons. Each component of the position operator is a one-electron operator, they can be represented in second quantization as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}= \sum_{ij} \left \langle i\mid \hat{x}\mid j\right \rangle a^{\dagger}_i a_j&lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'',''j'' run over orbitals. The expectation values of the position components are the first moments of the electrons' position.

Now we consider the tensorial square (second moment). In this sense, there are two types of them:

* in [[quantum chemistry]] programs like [[MOLPRO]] or DALTON the second moment operator is a tensor defined as the sum of the tensor squares of the positions of a single electron. Then, this is a one-electron operator ''s'' defined by its Cartesian components:

:: &lt;math&gt;\hat{s}_{xx}=\sum_{i=1}^n \hat{x}_i^2 \qquad \hat{s}_{xy}=\sum_{i=1}^n \hat{x} \hat{y}\qquad \hat{s}_{xz}=\sum_{i=1}^n \hat{x} \hat{z} &lt;/math&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;\hat{s}_{yy}=\sum_{i=1}^n \hat{y}_i^2 \qquad \hat{s}_{yz}=\sum_{i=1}^n \hat{y} \hat{z}\qquad \hat{s}_{zz}=\sum_{i=1}^n \hat{z}_i^2 &lt;/math&gt;

: where index ''i'' runs over the number of electrons. 
* there is also the square of the total position operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}&lt;/math&gt;. This is a two-electron operator ''S'', and also defined by its Cartesian components:

:: &lt;math&gt;\hat{S}_{xx}=\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \hat{x}_i \hat{x}_j \qquad \hat{S}_{xy}=\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \hat{x}_i \hat{y}_j \qquad \hat{S}_{xz}=\sum_{i=1}^n  \sum_{j=1}^n\hat{x}_i \hat{z}_j &lt;/math&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;\hat{S}_{yy}=\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \hat{y}_i\hat{y}_j \qquad \hat{S}_{yz}=\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \hat{y}_i \hat{z}_j\qquad \hat{S}_{zz}=\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n \hat{z}_i \hat{z}_j &lt;/math&gt;

: where indices ''i'',''j'' run over electrons.

The second moment of the position becomes then the sum of the one- and two-electron operators already defined:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{S}_{ab} = \mathbf{\hat{S}}_{ab} + \mathbf{\hat{s}}_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;

Given a ''n''-electron wave function &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt;, one wants to compute the ''second moment cumulant'' of it.  A cumulant is a linear combination of moments so we have:

: &lt;math&gt;\Lambda = \left \langle \Psi\mid S_{ab}\mid\Psi\right \rangle_c = \left \langle \Psi\mid S_{ab}\mid\Psi\right \rangle - \left \langle \Psi\mid\hat{a}\mid\Psi\right \rangle \left \langle \Psi\mid\hat{b}\mid\Psi\right \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

=== Spin-partitioned TPS, (SP-TPS) ===

The position operator can be partitioned according to spin components.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat r} = \sum_{\sigma = \alpha,\beta} \mathbf{\hat r_{\sigma}}&lt;/math&gt;

From the one-particle operator it is possible to define the total spin-partitioned position operator as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat R} = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{\sigma=\alpha,\beta} \mathbf{\hat R}(i)
    \mathbf{\hat n}_\sigma(i)&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the total position operator &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat R}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed by the sum of the two spin parts &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;:
                                                                                                                     
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat R} = \mathbf{\hat R_{\alpha}} + \mathbf{\hat R_{\beta}}&lt;/math&gt;

and the square of the total position operator decomposes as:                    
                                                                                
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat R}^2 = \mathbf{\hat R}_{\alpha}^2 + \mathbf{\hat R}_{\beta}^2 + \mathbf{\hat R}_{\alpha} \mathbf{\hat R}_{\beta} + \mathbf{\hat R}_{\beta} \mathbf{\hat R}_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;                                                      
                                                                                
Thus, there are four joint second moment cumulant of the spin-partitioned position operator:                                                                       
                                                                                
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Lambda} = \mathbf{\Lambda}_{\alpha\alpha} + \mathbf{\Lambda}_{\beta\beta}   
    +  \mathbf{ \Lambda}_{\alpha\beta} +  \mathbf{\Lambda}_{\beta\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==

===Model Hamiltonians===

====Hubbard model====
[[File:HubbardTPS.png|thumbnail|Figure 1: SS-TPS as a function of the ''-t/U'' ratio is computed numerically for equally-spaced 1D chains of hydrogen atoms.]]
The [[Hubbard model]] is a very simple and approximate model employed in [[Condensed matter physics]] to describe the transition of materials from metals to insulators. It takes into account only two parameters: ''i)'' the kinetic energy or hopping integral denoted by ''-t''; and  ''ii)'' the on-site repulsion between electrons represented by ''U'' (see the [[Hubbard model#Example: 1D chain of hydrogen atoms|example for 1D chain of hydrogen atoms]]).

In Figure 1, there are two limit cases to consider: larger values of ''-t/U'' representing a strong charge fluctuation (electrons free to move) whereas for small values of ''-t/U'' the electrons are completely localized. The SS-TPS is very sensitive to these changes, because it increases faster than linearly when electrons start to present mobility (0.0 to 0.5 range of ''-t/U'').

====Heisenberg model====
&lt;!-- [[File:HeisTPS.png|thumbnail|Figure 2: ]] --&gt;

=== Monitor the wave function ===
[[File:H2TPS.png|thumbnail|Figure 3: SS-TPS as a function of the internuclear distance R for the hydrogen dimer.]]
The TPS is a powerful tool to monitor the wave function. In Figure 3 is shown the longitudinal SS-TPS ('''Λ&lt;sup&gt;∥&lt;/sup&gt;''') computed at [[full configuration interaction]] level for the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; diatomic molecule. The '''Λ&lt;sup&gt;∥&lt;/sup&gt;''' in the high repulsive region shows a value that is lower than in the asymptotic limit. This is a consequence of nuclei being near to each other's causing and enhancement of the effective nuclear charge that makes electrons to be more localized. When stretching the bond, the TPS starts growing until it reaches a maximum (strong delocalization of the wave function) before the bond is broken. Once the bond is broken, the wave function becomes a sum of disconnected localized regions and the tensor decreases until it reaches twice the value of the atomic limit (1 bohr² for each hydrogen atom).

=== Spin delocalization ===
[[File:H2SPTPS.png|thumbnail|Figure 4: SP-TPS as a function of the internuclear distance R for the hydrogen dimer.]]
When the total position-spread tensor is partitioned according to spin (SP-TPS), it becomes a powerful tool to describe spin delocalization in the insulating regime.  In Figure 4 is shown the longitudinal SP-TPS ('''Λ&lt;sup&gt;∥&lt;/sup&gt;''') computed at [[full configuration interaction]] level for the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; diatomic molecule. The horizontal line at 0 bohr&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; divides the same spin (positive values) and different spin (negative values) contributions of the spin partitioned TPS. Unlike the SS-TPS that saturates to the atomic value for R&gt;5, the SP-TPS diverges as R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; indicating that there is a strong spin delocalization. The SP-TPS can also be seen as a measure of how strong the electron correlation is.

== Properties ==

The TPS is a cumulant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=R. Kubo |title=Generalized cumulant expansion method |journal=Journal of the Physical Society of Japan |volume=17 |issue= 7 |pages=1100–1120 |year= 1962|pmid= |doi=10.1143/JPSJ.17.1100|bibcode = 1962JPSJ...17.1100K }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus it possesses the following properties:

# Cumulants can be explicitly represented only by moments of lower or equal order.
# Cumulants are a linear combination of the products of these moments of lower or equal order.
# Cumulants are additive. This is a very important property when studying molecular systems because it means that the TPS tensor shows size consistency.
# A diagonal element of the cumulant tensor is the [[variance]] (see also [[Measurement in quantum mechanics#Statistics of measurement|this article]]), and it is always a positive value.
# Cumulants also are invariant under translation of the origin of when they are of order ≥&amp;nbsp;2. The TPS tensor being a second-order culumant, is invariant under translation of the origin.
# The TPS is more sensitive to the variation of the [[wave function]] than the energy, which makes it a good indicator for instance in a [[Metal–insulator transition]] situation.

[[File:Tratado Pirineos 1659.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The geopolitical effects of the Treaty of Pyrenees (1659)]]

The '''Treaty of the Pyrenees''' ({{lang-fr|Traité des Pyrénées}}, {{lang-es|Tratado de los Pirineos}}, {{lang-ca|Tractat dels Pirineus}}, {{lang-pt|Tratado dos Pirenéus}}) was signed on 7 November 1659 to end the [[Franco-Spanish War (1635–59)|1635–1659 war]] between [[France]] and [[Spain]],&lt;ref name="Cooper1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. P. Cooper|title=The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 4, The Decline of Spain and the Thirty Years War, 1609-48/49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbU8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA428|date=20 December 1979|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-29713-4|page=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; a war that was initially a part of the wider [[Thirty Years' War]]. It was signed on [[Pheasant Island]], a river island on the border between the two countries which has remained a French-Spanish [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] since the treaty. The kings [[Louis XIV of France]] and [[Philip IV of Spain]] were represented by their chief ministers, [[Cardinal Mazarin]] and Don [[Luis Méndez de Haro]], respectively.&lt;ref name="Sahlins1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Sahlins|title=Boundaries: The Making of France and Spain in the Pyrenees|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WPLEOKM1CI8C&amp;pg=PA25|year=1989|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-91121-5|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

France entered the Thirty Years' War after the [[Spanish Habsburg]] victories in the [[Dutch Revolt]] in the 1620s and at the [[Battle of Nördlingen (1634)|Battle of Nördlingen]] against [[Sweden]] in 1634. By 1640, France began to interfere in Spanish politics, aiding the [[Reapers' War|revolt in Catalonia]], while Spain responded by aiding the [[Fronde]] revolt in France in 1648. During the negotiations for the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, France gained the [[Sundgau]] and cut off Spanish access to the [[Netherlands]] from [[Austria]], leading to open warfare between the French and Spanish.

After 23 years of war, an Anglo-French alliance was victorious at the [[Battle of the Dunes (1658)|Battle of the Dunes]] in June 14, 1658, but the following year the war ground to a halt when the French campaign to take [[Milan]] was defeated. Peace was settled by means of the Treaty of the Pyrenees in November 1659.

==Content==
[[File:Ignoto (forse jean hardy), luigi XIV e filippo IV di spagna, pace dei pirenei, 1660.JPG|thumb|Medal celebrating the Treaty (1660)]]

France gained [[Roussillon]] (including [[Perpignan]]) and the northern half of [[Cerdanya]], [[Montmédy]] and other parts of [[Luxembourg]], [[Artois]] and other towns in [[Flanders]], including Arras, [[Béthune]], [[Gravelines]] and [[Thionville]], and a new border with Spain was fixed at the Pyrenees.&lt;ref name=pyrconditions&gt;{{cite book|last=Maland M.A.|first=David|title=Europe in the Seventeenth Century|publisher=Macmillan|year=1991|edition=Second |pages=227|isbn=0-333-33574-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the treaty stipulated only that all "villages" north of the Pyrenees should become part of France. Because it was a villa, the historic town of [[Llívia]], once the capital of Cerdanya, was thus unintentionally exempted from the treaty and became a Spanish exclave as part of the ''[[comarca]]'' of [[Baixa Cerdanya]], in the [[Spanish provinces|Spanish province]] of [[Girona (province)|Girona]]. This border was not properly settled until the [[France–Spain border|Treaty of Bayonne]] was signed in 1856, with its final acts accepted 12 years later. On the western Pyrenees a definite borderline was drawn and decisions made as to the politico-administrative affiliation of bordering areas in the Basque region&amp;mdash;[[Baztan (valley)|Baztan]], [[Aldude]], [[Valcarlos]].

Spain was forced to recognize and confirm all of the French gains at the Peace of Westphalia.&lt;ref name=pyrconditions/&gt;

In exchange for the Spanish territorial losses, the French king pledged to quit his support for [[Portugal]] and renounced to his claim to the [[county of Barcelona]], which the French crown had claimed ever since the [[Reapers' War|Catalan Revolt]] (also known as Reapers' War).&lt;ref name=pyrconditions/&gt; The Portuguese revolt in 1640, led by the Duke of Braganza, was supported monetarily by Cardinal Richelieu of France. After the Catalan Revolt, France had controlled the [[Principality of Catalonia]] from January 1641, when a combined Catalan and French force defeated the Spanish army at [[Battle of Montjuïc (1641)|Battle of Montjuïc]], until it was defeated by a Spanish army at Barcelona in 1652.&lt;ref name="Pendrillrevolts"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pendrill|first=Colin|title=Spain 1474 - 1700|editor=Martin Collier, Erica Lewis |publisher=Heinemann Advanced History, The Triumphs and Tribulations of Empire |year=2002|pages=142–143|isbn=978-0-435-32733-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Spanish army reconquered most of Catalonia, the French retained Catalan territory north of the Pyrenees.

The treaty also arranged for a marriage between [[Louis XIV of France]] and [[Maria Theresa of Spain]], the daughter of [[Philip IV of Spain]].&lt;ref name=pyrconditions/&gt; Maria Theresa was forced to renounce her claim to the Spanish throne, in return for a monetary settlement as part of her [[dowry]]. This settlement was never paid, a factor that eventually led to the [[War of Devolution]] in 1668.  At the [[Meeting on the Isle of Pheasants]] in June 1660, the two monarchs and their ministers met, and the princess entered France.

In addition, the English received [[Dunkirk]],&lt;ref name=pyrconditions/&gt; although they elected to sell it to France in 1662.

==Consequences==
The Treaty of the Pyrenees was the last major diplomatic achievement by Cardinal Mazarin. Combined with the [[Peace of Westphalia]], it allowed Louis XIV remarkable stability and diplomatic advantage by means of a weakened [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Condé]] and a weakened Spanish Crown, along with the agreed dowry, which was an important element in the French king's strategy:
[[Image:Catalonia2.png|200px|thumb|Map of [[Catalonia]], showing the partition of its territory by means of the Treaty of the Pyrenees.]]
All in all, by 1660, when the [[Deluge (history)|Swedish occupation of Poland]] was over, most of the European continent was at peace ([[Portuguese Restoration War]], third stage), and the Bourbons had ended the dominance of the [[Habsburgs]].&lt;ref name="Cooper1979431–432"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

===French annexations===

In the context of the territorial changes involved in the Treaty, France gained some territory, on both its northern and southern borders.

*In the north, France gained [[French Flanders]].
*In the south: 
::# On the east: The northern part of the [[Principality of Catalonia]], including [[Roussillon]], [[Conflent]], [[Vallespir]], [[Capcir]], and [[French Cerdagne]], was transferred to France, i.e. what later came to be known as "[[Northern Catalonia]]".
::# On the west: The parties agree to put together a field group to compromise a borderline on disputed lands along the Basque Pyrenees, involving Sareta&amp;mdash;[[Zugarramurdi]], [[Ainhoa, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Ainhoa]], etc.&amp;mdash; [[Aldude]], and the Spanish wedge of [[Valcarlos]].
