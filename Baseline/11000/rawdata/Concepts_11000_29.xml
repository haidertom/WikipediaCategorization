'''Asiddhatva''' is a Sanskrit term which is derived from the word, ''Asiddha'' ({{lang-sa|असिद्ध्}}), which means imperfect, incomplete, unaccomplished, unaffected, unproved, not existing or not having taken effect (as a rule or operation as taught in grammar) or not possessed of magic power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=संस्कृत कोश समुच्चयः|url= http://www.andhrabharati.com/dictionary/sanskrit/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term refers to the state of imperfection, incompleteness, etc.; or to the state of being imperfect or incomplete etc.; but mainly implies not in existence (Jain usage) or non-existent or no order of taking effect (Sanskrit Grammar).

==Overview==
''Asiddhatva'', which means - the endless application of rules, occurs on account of conflict or when the question is of conflict, there is no ''asiddhatva''. ''Asiddha'' means – not having taken effect with regard to the application of the other rules belonging to the same section. But, [[Patanjali]] states that rules which cause endless repetition of application cannot be there. Therefore, it is said that the application of a rule should certainly result in finality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ashtadhyayi of Panini|author=Panini|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|page=202|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFiCjATkpP4C&amp;pg=PR21&amp;lpg=PR21&amp;dq=asiddhatva&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=33u0VrPYux&amp;sig=_QSzYwMtluinJ0NU4gdHDxNxiDA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SzaoUqjQI8uh7Ab0r4DwDQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=asiddhatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jainism]], the ''audayika-bhava'' has 21 ''bheda'' or sub-species beginning with ''asiddhatva'' which is the state of unholiness, the lacking of spiritual perfection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Doctrine of Karman in Jain Philosophy|author=Helmuth von Glasenapp|publisher=Jain Publishing Company|pages=38–42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bd-5sKkV1XQC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=asiddhatva+in+jainism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u2P7HKA6mD&amp;sig=n2CuI-fsVsmzZlT75zkpVoFWbMw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CJGpUqacE-KM7AbSj4CQDA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=asiddhatva%20in%20jainism&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Panini’s principle of ''asiddha''==
[[Ashtadhyayi]] reveals that [[Pāṇini]] formulates his rules of grammar in view of a ''samanya'' or 'general', ''visesa'' or 'particular' and ''sesa'' or 'residual' relationship. A particular rule is said to carve out its domain of application from within the domain of its corresponding general rule by way of an ''apavada'' i.e. exception, to its related general rule. A rule is formulated to apply and it is never regarded as completely without the scope of its application. In case two rules simultaneously apply the rule subsequent in order blocks the prior rule; though there are some exceptions. Blocking by a ''bhiranga'' or the externally conditioned rule by ''antaranga'' or the internally conditioned rule is permitted. But, since two entities can be replaced by each other the application of rules can be treated as suspended (''asiddha'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ashtadhyayi of Panini Vol.1: Introduction to the Ashtadhyayi as a Grammatical Device|author=Ram Nath Sharma|publisher=Munshilal Manoharlal Publishers|page=5|url=http://sanskrt.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Volume_1-Introduction_to_the_Astadhyayi_as_a_Grammatical_Device.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Panini has used the word - ''asiddha'', three times, that is, in ''Sutra''s 6.1.86, 6.4.22 and 8.2.1; in ''Sutra'' 6.4.22 he uses the suffix ''vat'' derived from the term ''vati'' meaning – 'as if', which indicates that simultaneous taking effect of rules in  ''Abhiya'' section is not permitted. Only when a rule has taken effect does it make sense to say that it is as if it had not taken effect. The phrase ''purvatrasiddham'' of ''Sutra'' 8.2.1 tells us that the rules in ''tripadi'' can be used in a certain order only as found in Ashtadhyayi, therefore, ''asiddha'' determines in what order rules are to be applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Asiddha in Ashtadhiyayi: a misunderstanding among the traditional commentators?|author=Johannes Bronkhorst| authorlink = Johannes Bronkhorst |publisher=Journal of Indian Philosophy|pages=69–85|url=https://www.academia.edu/3287953/Asiddha_in_the_A_adhyayi_a_misunderstanding_among_the_traditional_commentators}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Panini’s account of ''Asiddhatva''==
''Asiddhatva'', which means - the endless application of rules, occurs on account of conflict or when the question is of conflict, there is no ''asiddhatva''. ''Asiddha'' means – not having taken effect with regard to the application of the other rules belonging to the same section. But, [[Patanjali]] states that rules which cause endless repetition of application cannot be there. Therefore, it is said that the application of a rule should certainly result in finality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ashtadhyayi of Panini|author=Panini|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|page=202|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFiCjATkpP4C&amp;pg=PR21&amp;lpg=PR21&amp;dq=asiddhatva&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=33u0VrPYux&amp;sig=_QSzYwMtluinJ0NU4gdHDxNxiDA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SzaoUqjQI8uh7Ab0r4DwDQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=asiddhatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Ashtadhyayi]] of Panini the ''sutra''s are declared ''asidddha'' in the following instances:
* 1) ''purvatrasiddham'' (''Sutra'' 8.2.1). The ''sutra''s from 8.2.1 to 8.4.68 (''tripadi'') are ''asiddha'' to ''sutra''s from 1.1.1. to 8.1.74 (''sapadasaptadhyayi''); also in ''tripadi'' the successive ''sutra''s are ''asiddha'' to their previous ''sutra''s.
* 2) ''asiddhavadatrabhat'' (''Sutra'' 6.4.22.) The ''sutra''s from 6.4.22 to 6.4.175. are deemed ''asiddha'' to each other.
* 3) ''satvatukorasiddhah'' (''Sutra'' 6.1.86.) The ''sutra''s from 6.1.87 to 6.1.111. are ''asiddha'' to ''satva'' ''sutra''s (8.3.39 to 8.3.119) and ''tuk'' ''sutra''s (6.1.70 to 6.1.75)
The concept of ''asiddhatva'' has been used in [[Ashtadhyayi]]
* a) to prevent the application of ''sutra'' on the substitute
* b) to enable the application of ''sutra'' on the substituent and
* c) to mandate the order of the application of ''sutra''s, and
finds its application in the ''viddhi'' ''sutra''s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Asiddhatava Principle in Computational Model of Ashtadhyayi|author=Sridhar Subbanna|page=1|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-17528-2_18#page-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a filter- technique it applies word internally in a pre-suffixal stem-suffix relation. ''Sutra'' 6.4.22 lays down the condition of ''samanasryatva'' having the same conditioning element for ''asiddhatva''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ashtadhyayi of Panini|author=Panini|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|pages=82, 352|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFiCjATkpP4C&amp;pg=PR21&amp;lpg=PR21&amp;dq=asiddhatva&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=33u0VrPYux&amp;sig=_QSzYwMtluinJ0NU4gdHDxNxiDA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SzaoUqjQI8uh7Ab0r4DwDQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=asiddhatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''siddha''- principle, all rules interact in a transparent way, whereas the ''asiddha''-principle is a default principle which can be defeated at cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Architecture of Panini’s Grammar |author=Paul Kiparsky|publisher=Academia.edu|page=|url=https://www.academia.edu/3082019/On_the_Architecture_of_Paninis_Grammar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application of rules==
A ''[[sutra]]'' or a rule is said to be ''asiddha'' in regard to another if, with respect to this latter, it is conceived of as not to exist. The forms to which a ''sutra'' normally applies are as arise according to ''sutra''s which are ''siddha'' i.e. the rules that can have an effect. The number of forms which fall under a rule depends on the relation to ''sutra''s which are ''siddha''. The opportunities for application of a rule to cases are determined by the ''sutra''s which are ''asiddha'' i.e. do not have an effect, by which the forms are added or excluded, that is, by the ''asiddhatva'' of the one ''sutra'' cases are added to the other or excluded from the other which are ''siddha''. By this method the right tracing of the cases that are to conform to a rule, is secured only if, whether by ''sutra''s which are ''siddha'' or by such ''asiddha'', those substitutions which are desired or even not desired, are secured or prevented respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Tripadi:Being an English recast of Purvatrasiddham|author=Herman Eildert Buiskool|publisher=Brill Archive|pages=62–67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NBsVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=asiddhatva&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1-XKFmiUCv&amp;sig=3Hax2bSCmJON5ntDKRqvjwT3FRI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SzaoUqjQI8uh7Ab0r4DwDQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=asiddhatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sutra'' 6.4.22 which reads - असिद्धवदत्रभात् | (''asiddhavadatrabhaat'') is an ''adhikara'' ''sutra'' that defines the limits up to which it is valid as अभात् (''a bhaat''), in which ''sutra'' the word अत्र (''atra'') means - in that domain or in the domain of the same conditioning element. The rules in the ''asiddhavat'' section apply in the same conditioning (linguistic) element. The word ''asiddhavat'' is taken as a variant of the word ''asiddha''. The purpose of a ''siddha'' is to allow an operation conditioned by a ''sthanin'' (item to be replaced) or prohibit an operation conditioned by a substitute. ''Asiddhatva'' has a blocking effect and also a feeding effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ashtadhyayi of Panini Vol.9|author= S.Joshi|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|page=xviii|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/109260018/The-Astadhyayi-of-Panini-Vol-ix-by-S-joshi-J-roodbergen-300dpi-Jbig2-Lossy}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Asiddhatva'' invariably leads to ''[[Anavastha]]''.

==Jain Philosophy of Karman and ''Asiddhatva''==
The Jain Philosophy extends the concept of Karman beyond the good and the bad and also beyond their resultant enjoyment or punishment. Each kind of karman works with a specified intensity, and there are eight mula-prakrtis (species) of karmans depending upon their prakrti, stithi, rasa and pradesas, viz. Jnanavarana-karmans which obscure knowledge, Darsanavarna-karmanas which obscure undifferentiated cognition, Vedaniya-karmans which produce the feeling of joy and grief, Mohaniya-karmans which obstruct belief and conduct, Ayus-karmans which determine duration of life, Nama-karmans which give various factors of individuality, Gotra-karmans which define family surroundings and Antaraya-karmans which hinder Jiva’s capability of resolution and enjoyment, and their numerous uttara-prakrtis (sub-species).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Karman in itself|publisher=Jainworld.com|url= http://www.jainworld.com/book/doctrineofkarma/ch7.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain thinkers believe that the time during which the ''karman''s work and the intensity with which they manifest themselves is definite and that it is possible for all ''karman''s to increase or decrease their effects and also transform which transformation they call ''samkarma''. Different kinds of ''karman'' which can be related to one another also establish a relationship with the ''Jiva'' (soul) and the states (''bhava'') produced in it by them. In the ''Jiva'' there can manifest five states – the ''parinamika'' or the essential state, the ''audayika'' or the state which is the consequence of the unhindered realisation of ''karman''s, the ''aupasamika'' or the state produced by the suppression of the ''karman''s, the ''ksayika'' or the state resulting from the annihilation of the ''karman''s and the ''kasayopasamika'' or the mixed state. The ''audayika-bhava'' has 21 ''bheda'' or sub-species beginning with ''asiddhatva'' which is the state of unholiness, the lacking of spiritual perfection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Doctrine of Karman in Jain Philosophy|author=Helmuth von Glasenapp|publisher=Jain Publishing Company|pages=38–42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bd-5sKkV1XQC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=asiddhatva+in+jainism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u2P7HKA6mD&amp;sig=n2CuI-fsVsmzZlT75zkpVoFWbMw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CJGpUqacE-KM7AbSj4CQDA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=asiddhatva%20in%20jainism&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jain terminology ''asiddhatva'' refers to the unproved state and to the non-existent i.e. whose existence cannot be proved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of Jain words|publisher=Colorado State University|url= http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/jaingloss.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to the state of non-salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Terminology of Jainism|author=Dinesh Vora|page=53|url= http://www.jainology.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/TERMINOLOGY-OF-JAINISM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Siddha'' is the soul who has attained the status of the supreme Soul by shedding all karmic matter associated with itself and then cease to interfere in the affairs of the universe. ''Asiddhatva'' leads to [[Anavastha]] which is a ''dosha'' (defect) according to [[Hemachandra]].

==Introduction==
Theravada Buddhist cosmology describes the 31 planes of existence in which rebirth takes place. The order of the planes are found in various discourses of [[Gautama Buddha]] in the Sutta Pitaka. For example, in the [[Saleyyaka Sutta]] of the [[Majjhima Nikaya]] the Buddha mentioned the planes above the human plane in ascending order.&lt;ref&gt;Nanamoli Bhikkhu, The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha. Wisdom Publications,1995, page 1186.&lt;/ref&gt; In several [[sutra|suttas]] in the [[Anguttara Nikaya]], the Buddha described the causes of rebirth in these planes in the same order. In Buddhism, the ''[[Deva (Buddhism)|devas]]'' are not immortal gods that play a creative role in the cosmic process. They are simply elevated beings who had been reborn in the celestial planes as a result of their words, thoughts, and actions. Usually, they are just as much in bondage to delusion and desire as human beings, and as in need of guidance from the Enlightened One. The Buddha is the "teacher of devas and humans (satthadevamanussanam). The devas came to visit the Buddha in the night. The Devatasamyutta and the Devaputtasamyutta of the Samyutta Nikaya gives a record of their conversations. The devaputtas are young devas newly arisen in heavenly planes, and devatas are mature deities.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2000). The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya. Boston: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-331-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are more than 10,000 [[crore]] (100 billion) solar systems in our Galaxy, and more than 10,000 crore (100 billion) galaxies in our Universe. There are many Universes in space. Past and future lives may occur on other planets. The data for the 31 planes of existence in samsara are compiled from the Majjhima Nikaya, Anguttara Nikaya, [[Samyutta Nikaya]], [[Digha Nikaya]], [[Khuddaka Nikaya]], and others. The 31 planes of existence can be perceived by a Buddha's Divine eye (''dibbacakkhu'') and some of his awakened disciples through the development of ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana]]'' meditation. According to the ''suttas'', a Buddha can access all these planes and know all his past lives as well as those of other beings.

In the Maha-Saccaka Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya of the Pali Canon, Gautama Buddha said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away &amp; reappearance of beings. I saw — by means of the divine eye, purified &amp; surpassing the human — beings passing away &amp; re-appearing, and I discerned how they are inferior &amp; superior, beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp; unfortunate in accordance with their kamma: 'These beings — who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, &amp; mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views — with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings — who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech &amp; mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views — with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in the heavenly world.' Thus — by means of the divine eye, purified &amp; surpassing the human — I saw beings passing away &amp; re-appearing, and I discerned how they are inferior &amp; superior, beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp; unfortunate in accordance with their kamma.&lt;ref&gt;Nanamoli Bhikkhu, The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha. Wisdom Publications,1995, page 1070.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the Itivuttaka edition of the Khuddaka Nikaya and in the Māpuññabhāyi Sutta of the Anguttara Nikaya, the Buddha told about his past lives:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Whenever the eon contracted I reached the "Plane of Streaming Radiance", and when the eon expanded I arose in an empty divine mansion. And there I was Brahma, the great Brahma, the unvanquished victor, the all-seeing, the all-powerful. Thirty-six times I was Sakka, ruler of the devas. And many hundreds of times I was a wheel-turning monarch, righteous, a king of righteousness, conqueror of the four regions of the earth, maintaining stability in the land, in possession of the seven treasures.&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, In the Buddha's Words. Wisdom Publications, 2005, page 588.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Māpuññabhāyi Sutta, Aṅgutarra Nikaya 7.59: Pali Text Society, A iv 88-89&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Causes for rebirth in various planes===
The process by which sentient beings migrate from one state of existence to another is dependent on causes and conditions. The three causes are giving or charity, moral conduct, meditative development, and their opposites. Rebirth in the [[Kama-loka]] depends on a person's moral conduct and practice of giving. Rebirth in the [[Trailokya|Rupa-loka]] and [[Trailokya|Arupa-loka]] also requires meditation development. Liberation from all rebirth requires wisdom in addition to moral conduct and meditation.

About the cycle of rebirth, [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], a scholar monk who has translated numerous texts from the Pali Canon, writes that beyond all planes of existence is the unconditioned [[Nibbana]], the final goal of the Buddha's teaching: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A blissful heavenly rebirth, however, is not the final purpose for which the Buddha taught the Dhamma. At best it is only a temporary way station. The ultimate goal is the cessation of suffering, and the bliss of the heavens, no matter how blissful, is not the same as the cessation of suffering.  According to the Buddha's teaching, all states of existence within the round of rebirths, even the heavens, are transient, unreliable, bound up with pain. Thus, the ultimate aim of the Dhamma is nothing short of liberation, which means total release from the round of rebirth and death.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi, Bhikkhu (ed.) (2005). In The Words of the Buddha: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon. Boston: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-491-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Liberation from rebirth===
Liberation from the rounds of rebirth requires more than just meditation achievement. It is necessary to apply ''[[Yoniso Manasikara]]'' after emerging from ''[[Samma Samadhi]]'' (1st to 4th jhana) in order to arrive at a breakthrough by wisdom. The [[Udana]] shows that after emerging from the ''[[jhana]]s'', the Buddha directed his attention to the cause of ''[[dukkha]]'' and the way leading to its cessation. This process culminates in the discovery of ''[[Pratītyasamutpāda]]'' (dependent origination) and the [[Four Noble Truths]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When the seven days had come to a close, the Exalted One arose from the state of trance and in the first watch of the night, thoroughly thought out the chain of cause and effect, in direct order, thus; "If there is this (state), another (state) arises, by the arising of this (state), a (state) is produced, that is to say:
"From Ignorance spring Fabrications, from Fabrications springs Consciousness, from Consciousness spring Mind and Material Form, from Mind and Material Form, the six Organs of Sense, from the six Organs of Sense, Contact, from Contact, Sensations, from Sensations, Desire, from Desire, Attachment, from Attachment, Becoming, from Becoming, Birth, from Birth spring Decay, Death, Sorrow, Lamentation, Pain, Grief and Despair.

===The 31 Planes of Existence===

====Arupa-Loka (Formless Realms)====
The immaterial or formless sphere (''arupa loka'') includes four planes into which beings are born as a result of attaining the Four Formless Jhana ''[[Arupajhana|arūpadhyānas]]''. The inhabitants of these realms are possessed entirely of mind. Having no physical form or location, they are unable to hear ''Dhamma'' teachings. They achieve this by attaining the formless ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana]]'' levels in a previous life, and now enjoy the fruits (''[[vipaka|vipāka]]'') of the good [[karma]] of that accomplishment for a period before rebirth in a lower plane again. They do not interact with the rest of the universe.

* 31 - Sphere of Neither Perception Nor Non-Perception (''nevasannanasannayatanupaga deva''): Rebirth in this plane is a result of attaining the fourth formless ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana]] in a previous life. The beings in this plane only have mind and no physical body. They are unable to hear Dhamma. In this sphere the formless beings do not engage in "perception". Uddaka Ramaputra's father reached this plane and thought that this is awakening. After having experienced this state the Buddha realized that it will eventually lead to further rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, In the Buddha's Words. Wisdom Publications, 2005, page 801.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 30 - Sphere of Nothingness (''akincannayatanupaga deva''): Rebirth in this plane is a result of attaining the third formless ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana]]'' in a previous life. This is considered a form of perception, though a very subtle one. This was the sphere reached by Āḷāra Kālāma, [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]]'s first teacher. Alara Kalama thought that it is the state of awakening or liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, In the Buddha's Words. Wisdom Publications, 2005, page 796.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 29 - The Sphere of Infinite Consciousness (''vinnanancayatanupaga deva''): Rebirth in this plane is a result of attaining the second formless ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana]]''. In this sphere formless beings dwell meditating on their consciousness (''[[vijnana|vijñāna]]'') as infinitely pervasive.  
* 28 - Sphere of Infinite Space (''akasanancayatanupaga deva''): Rebirth in this plane is a result of attaining the first formless ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana]]''.

====Rupa-Loka (Fine-Material World )====
The fine material sphere (''rupa-loka'') consists of sixteen planes. Beings are reborn into these planes as a result of attaining the form ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhanas]]''. The prevalent mode of experience here is meditative rather than sensory. They have bodies made of fine matter. The sixteen planes correspond to the attainment of the four form ''jhanas''. The ''devas'' of the ''rupa-loka'' have physical forms, but are sexless and passionless. Beings in the lower planes are not able to see beings in planes higher than theirs. The beings of the Form realm are not subject to the extremes of pleasure and pain, or governed by desires for things pleasing to the senses, as the beings of the ''Kāma-loka'' are. The bodies of Form realm beings do not have sexual distinctions. Like the beings of the Arupa-loka, the dwellers in the Rupa-loka have minds corresponding to the ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyānas]]'' (Pāli: jhānas). In their case it is the four lower ''jhanas'' or ''[[Rupajhana|rūpadhyānas]]''.

=====Pure Abodes (Suddhavasa)=====
{{Main|Pure land}}
The [[Pure land#.C5.9Auddh.C4.81v.C4.81sa worlds|Pure Abodes]] are distinct from the other worlds of the ''rupa-loka'' in that they do not house beings who have been born there through ordinary merit or meditative attainments. Birth in these five realms are a result of attaining the fruit of non-returning or ''[[Anagami]]'', the third level of enlightenment. These Pure Abodes are accessible only to those who have destroyed the lower five fetters, consisting of self-view, sceptical doubt, clinging to rites and ceremonies, sense desires, and ill-will.&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), pp. 31, 95, entries for "Anāgāmin" (retrieved 26 Sep 2007 at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:735.pali{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}) and "Āgāmin" (at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:2587.pali{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}).&lt;/ref&gt; They will destroy their remaining fetters of craving for fine material existence, craving for immaterial existence, conceit, restlessness and ignorance  during their existence in the Pure Abodes. Those who take rebirth here are called "non-returners" because they do not return from that world, but attain final ''nibbana'' there without coming back. They guard and protect Buddhism on earth, and will pass into enlightenment as ''[[Arhat]]s'' when they pass away from the ''[[Pure land#.C5.9Auddh.C4.81v.C4.81sa worlds|Suddhavasa]]'' worlds. According to the Ayacana Sutta, among its inhabitants is [[Brahmā (Buddhism)#Brahm.C4.81 Sahampati|Brahma Sahampati]], who begs the Buddha to teach ''[[Dhamma]]'' to the world.

The five Pure Abodes are:
* 27 - Peerless Devas (''Akanittha deva''): World of ''devas'' "un-equal in rank". The highest of all the ''Rūpadhātu'' worlds, it is often used to refer to the highest extreme of the universe. The current ''[[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra]]'' will eventually be born there.
* 26 - Clear-Sighted Devas (''Sudassi deva''): The "clear-seeing" ''devas'' live in a world similar to and friendly with the {{IAST|Akanitṭha}} world. 
* 25 - Beautiful Devas (''Sudassa deva''): The world of the "beautiful" devas is said to be the place of rebirth for five kinds of ''anāgāmins''. 
* 24 - Untroubled Devas (''Atappa deva''): The world of the "untroubled" devas, for whose company those of lower realms long.
* 23 - Devas not Falling Away (''Aviha deva''): The world of the "not falling" devas, perhaps the most common destination for reborn ''Anāgāmins''. Many achieve arhatship directly in this world, but some pass away and are reborn in sequentially higher worlds of the Pure Abodes until they are at last reborn in the {{IAST|Akanitṭha}} world. These are called in Pāli {{IAST|uddhaṃsotas}}, "those whose stream goes upward".

=====Bṛhatphala Planes=====
These two realms are a result of attaining the fourth jhana. They remain in the tranquil state attained in the 4th Jhana, and is characterized by equanimity ([[Upeksa|{{IAST|upekṣā}}]]).  
* 22 - Unconscious beings (''Asaññasatta''): Realm of mindless beings who have only bodies without consciousness. Rebirth into this plane results from a meditative practice aimed at the suppression of consciousness. Those who take up this practice assume release from suffering can be achieved by attaining unconsciousness. However, when the life span in this realm ends, the beings pass away and are born in other planes where consciousness returns.  
* 21 - Very Fruitful devas (''vehapphala deva''): In the Jhana Sutta of the Anguttara Nikaya the Buddha said "The Vehapphala devas, monks, have a life-span of 500 eons. A run-of-the-mill person having stayed there, having used up all the life-span of those devas, goes to hell, to the animal womb, to the state of the hungry shades."&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2010). Jhana Sutta: Mental Absorption(1)" (AN 4.123). Retrieved 2010-09-23 from "Access to Insight" at  http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.123.than.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

====={{IAST|Śubhakṛtsna}} Planes=====
These three realms are a result of attaining the third jhana. The mental state of the devas of these worlds corresponds to the third jhana, and is characterized by a quiet joy ([[sukha]]).  These devas have bodies that radiate a steady light. 
* 20 - Devas of Refulgent Glory (''subhakinna deva''): The Buddha said, "The Subhakinha devas, monks, have a life-span of 64 mahakalpas. A run-of-the-mill person having stayed there, having used up all the life-span of those devas, goes to hell, to the animal womb, to the state of the hungry shades."&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2010). Jhana Sutta: Mental Absorption(1)" (AN 4.123). Retrieved 2010-09-23 from "Access to Insight" at  http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.123.than.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  
* 19 - Devas of Unbounded Glory (''appamanasubha deva''): The world of devas of "limitless beauty".
* 18 - Devas of Limited Glory (''parittasubha deva''): The world of devas of "limited beauty".

=====Ābhāsvara Planes=====
These three are a result of attaining the second jhana. The mental state of the devas of the ''[[Abhasvaras|Ābhāsvara]]'' worlds corresponds to the second dhyāna, and is characterized by delight ([[Pīti|prīti]]) as well as joy ([[sukha]]). 
* 17 - Devas of Streaming Radiance (''abhassara deva''): The Abhassara devas have a life-span of 8 mahakalpas. After that period they are reborn in a lower realm.&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2010). Jhana Sutta: Mental Absorption(1)" (AN 4.123). Retrieved 2010-09-23 from "Access to Insight" at  http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.123.than.html.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 16 - Devas of Unbounded Radiance (''appamanabha deva''): The world of devas of "limitless light", a concept on which they meditate. Their lifespan is 4 ''[[mahākalpas]]''.
* 15 - Devas of Limited Radiance (''parittabha deva''): The world of devas of "limited light". Their lifespan is 2 ''mahākalpas''.

=====Brahmā Planes=====
{{Main|Brahma (Buddhism)}}
The mental state of the devas of the Brahmā worlds corresponds to the first jhana. Like all beings, the brahmas are still tied to the cycle of rebirth, though sometimes they forget this and imagine themselves to be immortal. The Buddha said "The devas of Brahma's retinue, monks, have a life-span of an eon. A run-of-the-mill person having stayed there, having used up all the life-span of those devas, goes to hell, to the animal womb, to the state of the hungry shades."&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2010). Jhana Sutta: Mental Absorption(1)" (AN 4.123). Retrieved 2010-09-23 from "Access to Insight" at  http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.123.than.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

One way to rebirth in the brahma world is mastery over the first jhana. Another is through meditations on loving kindness, compassion, altruistic joy, and equanimity. According to the Subha Sutta, the Brahmin Subha asked the Buddha to teach him how to be born in the world of Brahma. And the Buddha said to him: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Then young man, listen carefully I will tell.’ The young man agreed and the Blessed One said. The bhikkhu pervades one direction with thoughts of loving kindness, so too the second, the third, the fourth, above, below, across, in every respect, in all circumstances, the entire world, he pervades with the thought of loving kindness grown great and immeasurable without anger and ill will. Young man, when the release of the mind in loving kindness, is developed thus, none of the measured actions remain. Just as a clever drummer in no time would make known the message in the four directions. In the same manner, when the release of the mind in loving kindness, is developed thus, none of the measured actions remain. This is the method to be born with Brahma. 
Again the bhikkhu pervades one direction with the thought of compassion,…re…. with intrinsic joy,…re… with equanimity, so too the second, the third, the fourth, above, below, across, in every respect, in all circumstances, the entire world, he pervades with equanimity grown great and immeasurable without anger and ill will. Young man, when the release of the mind in equanimity, is developed thus, none of the measured actions remain. Just as a clever drummer in no time would make known the message in the four directions. In the same manner, when the release of the mind in equanimity is developed thus, none of the measured actions remain. This is the method to be born with Brahma.&lt;ref&gt;Nanamoli, Bhikkhu (trans.) (1995, ed. Bhikkhu Bodhi). The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Majjhima Nikaya. Boston: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-072-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* 14 - Great Brahmas (''Maha brahma''): One of this realm's most famous inhabitants is the Great [[Brahma]], a deity whose delusion leads him to regard himself as the all-powerful, all-seeing creator of the Universe. According to the Brahmajāla Sutta, a Mahā brahmā is a being from the Ābhāsvara worlds who falls into a lower world through exhaustion of his merits and is reborn alone in the Brahma-world; forgetting his former existence, he imagines himself to have come into existence without cause.

Related Sutta: Kevaddha Sutta

* 13 - Ministers of Brahma (''brahma-purohita deva''): The "Ministers of Brahmā" are beings, also originally from the Ābhāsvara worlds, that are born as companions to Mahābrahmā after he has spent some time alone. Since they arise after his thought of a desire for companions, he believes himself to be their creator, and they likewise believe him to be their creator and lord. 
* 12 - Retinue of Brahma (''brahma-parisajja deva''): The "Councilors of Brahmā" or the devas "belonging to the assembly of Brahmā".

====Kama-Loka (The Sense-Sphere realm)====
{{Main|Desire realm}}
Birth into these heavenly planes takes place as a result of giving and moral discipline. The Sense-Sphere Realm is the lowest of the three realms. The driving force within this realm is sensual desire. These devas enjoy aesthetic pleasures, long life, beauty, and certain powers. The heavenly planes are not reserved only for good Buddhists. Anyone who has led a wholesome life can be born in them. People who believe in an "eternal heaven" may carry their belief to the deva plane and take the long life span there to be an eternal existence. Only those who have known the Dhamma will realize that, as these planes are impermanent, some day these sentient beings will fall away from them and be reborn elsewhere. The devas can help people by inclining their minds to wholesome acts, and people can help the devas by inviting them to rejoice in their meritorious deeds.
 
Related Suttas: Saleyyaka Sutta, Dana Sutta

=====Higher Kama (Karma) Loka=====
These devas live in four heavens that float in the air, leaving them free from contact with the strife of the lower world.
* 11 - Devas Wielding Power over the Creation of Others (''Parinimmita-vasavattin deva''): These devas enjoy sensual pleasures created by others for them. These devas do not create pleasing forms that they desire themselves, but their desires are fulfilled by the acts of other devas who wish for their favor. [[Mara (demon)|Mara]], the personification of delusion and desire, lives here. 
* 10 - Devas Delighting in Creation (''Nimmanarati deva''): These devas delight in the sense objects of their own creation. They are capable of changing appearance to please themselves. The lord of this world is [[Sunirmita]] (Pāli Sunimmita).
* 9 - Contented deva (''Tusita deva''): [[Tushita]] is the home of the contented gods, among whom many [[Bodhisattva]]s, including the future Buddha [[Maitreya]], abide. Before his birth as Siddhartha, the present Buddha also used to dwell with the other [[Bodhisattva]]s in this realm. His name in this realm was Śvetaketu (Pāli: Setaketu). While Maitreya is undoubtably the most important of the dwellers in {{IAST|Tuṣita}}, the ruler of this world is {{IAST|Santuṣita}} (Pāli: Santusita).
* 8 - [[Yama]] devas: These Yama devas live in the air, free of all difficulties.

=====Lower Kama-Loka=====
{{Main|Sumeru}}
The lower devas of the Kama-loka live on different parts of the mountain at the center of the world, Sumeru. They are even more passionate than the higher devas, and do not simply enjoy themselves but also engage in strife and fighting. 
* 7 - [[Thirty-three gods]] (''Tavatimsa deva''): Beings that live on the peak of Sumeru are like the Olympian gods. Their ruler is Sakka or [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra]], a devotee of the Buddha. Sakka rules by righteousness, patience towards aggressors, and compassionate treatment of wrongdoers. Sakka and the devas honor sages and holy men. He earned his place as ruler of the devas by fulfilling seven vows which embody the standards of the virtuous householder while he was still a human being. The Buddha holds up Sakka's patience and forgiveness as a model for the ''[[bhikkhu]]s''. Many devas dwelling here live in mansions in the air. Besides the thirty-three devas, many other devas and supernatural beings dwell here, including the attendants of the devas and many [[apsaras]]es (nymphs).

Related Suttas: Sakka-panha Sutta and the Sakka Samyutta (11th section of the Samyutta Nikaya) which also contains 25 short discourses connected with Sakka.

* 6 - [[Four Great Kings]] (''catummaharajika deva''): The world of the Four Great Kings includes the martial kings who guard the four quarters of the Earth. The chief of these kings is Vaisravana, but all are ultimately accountable to Sakra.  Dhatarattha, king of the Eastern Direction, is lord of the gandhabbas. Virulha, king of the Southern Direction, is lord of the kumbandas. Virupakkha, king of the Western Direction, is lord of the nagas. Kuvera, who rules as king of the Northern Direction, is lord of the yakkhas. The devas who guide the Sun and Moon are also part of this world.

This is  home to the four types of earthly demigod or nature-spirit:  
Gandhabba - the celestial musicians or fairies
[[Yakkha]] - tree spirits of varying degrees of ethical purity. They are analogous to the goblins, trolls, ogres, and fairies of Western fairy tales. They inhabit remote areas such as forests, hills, and abandoned caves. Though living in misery they have the potential for awakening and can attain the path and fruits of the spiritual life.

Related Suttas: Yakkhasayutta of the Samyutta Nikaya.

According to the Atanatiya Sutta: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"There are non-humans who are fierce, violent, given to retaliation; those non-humans heed neither the (four) great kings, nor their ministers nor their attendants. They are called rebels against the (four) great kings. Even as in the kingdom of Magadha, the thieves heed neither the king of Magadha, nor the ministers, nor their attendants, and are called rebels against the king of Magadha, so there are non-humans who are fierce... (as before). They are called rebels against the (four) great kings."

======Human Beings (manussa loka)======
* 5 - [[Human]] (''manussa loka''): Birth in this plane results from giving and moral discipline of middling quality. This is the realm of moral choice where destiny can be guided. The Khana Sutta mentioned that this plane is a unique balance of pleasure and pain. It facilitates the development of virtue and wisdom to liberate oneself from the entire cycle or rebirths. For this reason rebirth as a human being is considered precious according to the Chiggala Sutta. In the Cula-kammavibhanga Sutta (The Shorter Analysis of Action), the Buddha taught that:

Killing others lead to short life if one becomes reborn in the human plane instead of the four lower States of Deprivation. By abandoning the very acts of killing and harming, one gets to be reborn in a heavenly world. Alternatively, one gets to be reborn in the human world being endowed with long life.

Injuring of others beings can lead to rebirth in the States of Deprivation. Alternatively, the person comes back in the human plane as someone very sickly. Non-injuring of others leads to rebirth in good destinations. Alternatively, one comes back to the human plane enjoying good health.

The same goes for the following:
* Beautiful or Unattractive Human Rebirth depends on whether the person has an irritable character in this life.
* Influential or Ordinary Human Rebirth depends on whether the person is envious of the gain and honor received by others in this life.
* Rich or Poor Human Rebirth depends on whether one is generous to others, such as providing the requisites of holy people, in this present life.

Related Suttas: Janussonin Sutta, Cula-kammavibhanga Sutta,

======States of Deprivation (Apaya)======
Rebirth into these planes results from unwholesome conduct. Beings reborn there have no moral sense and generally cannot create good kamma (karma). However, when the unwholesome kamma that brought them to these planes is exhausted, some stored good kamma can bring them rebirth in some other plane. Only stream-enterers and other ariyans can be sure they will never again be born in these planes of misery.

* 4 - [[Asura (Buddhism)|Asura]]: They are demons or "titans" that are engaged in endless conflict with each other. From the Jataka Tales, we are told that the Asuras are always fighting to regain their lost kingdom on the top of Mount Sumeru, but are unable to break the guard of the Four Great Kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kavassery|first=Rajesh|title=Jataka Tales|year=2007|publisher=Sura Books|isbn=9789555738019|page=118}}; also, see, Pali Text Society, Jataka Tales; PTS, J.i.202-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Asuras are divided into many groups, and have no single ruler, but among their leaders are [[Vemacitrin]] (Pāli: Vepacitti) and Rāhu. According to Marasinghe:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In later texts we find the Asura realm as one of the four unhappy states of rebirth. The Nikāya evidence however does not show that the Asura realm was regarded as a state of suffering"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marasinghe|first=M.M.J.|title=Gods in Buddhism|year=2009|publisher=Sarasavi Publishers|isbn=9789555738019|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In philosophy, the '''Cartesian Self''', part of a [[thought experiment]], is an individual's mind, separate from the body and the outside world, thinking about itself and its existence. It is distinguished from the [[Cartesian Other]], anything other than the Cartesian self. According to the philosopher [[Descartes]], there is a divide intrinsic to [[consciousness]], such that one cannot ever bridge the space between one's own consciousness and that of another.

Descartes concluded famously that [[Cogito ergo sum]], "I think, therefore I am", but realized that according to his [[wax argument]] you could never similarly demonstrate the existence of the 'other'.  However, the Cartesian Self, he concluded, is thus almost entirely [[Self-evidence|self-evident]]: the existence of some being ''asking'' about itself necessarily implied that such a being existed.  Because of this, while humans can know everything of the self and its mysteries, we cannot actually know anything of anything that is not the self.

It is based on the whole of the Cartesian Pure Inquirer, where cognitive capabilities and methods of achieving knowledge are alike to all knowers. However, the "knower" (particularly to Descartes) is treated as a featureless abstract, and not an actual person.

'''Chanchala''' is a [[Sanskrit]] [[adjective]] basically referring to the unsteady vacillating nature of human mind and actions which need to be stilled, neutralized or controlled for gaining right speech and vision.

==Meaning==

'''Chanchala''' ([[Sanskrit]]: चञ्चल) means - 'inconsiderate', 'nimble', 'shaking', 'inconstant', 'moveable', 'flickering', 'moving', 'unsteady', 'fortune', 'wind', 'long pepper', 'goddess of fortune' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+chanchala&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==

''Chanchala'' is the good word for 'vacillation' in Sanskrit language; in [[Sanskrit literature
Sanskrit|poetry]] the girl with the dancing eyes is called ''chanchalakshi'', which is considered to be rare attribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A More Ardent Fire|author=Eknath Easwaran|publisher=Nilgiri Press|page=176|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dxcNUISHyXEC&amp;pg=PT176&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lDkoU7mABIb8rAfj4YCwBg&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCDge#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as part of the literary evidence of [[Kushan Empire|Kusana period]], the word ''Chanchala'', like ''Dhavani'' and ''Rodini'', indicates the nature or action of [[Mother goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tribal Roots of Hinduism|author=Shiv Kumar Tiwari|publisher=Sarup&amp;Sons|page=138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n0gwfmPFTLgC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VDsoU5qnB8WJrQeI0YG4CQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBDgy#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Bhagavad Gita]](Sloka VI.26):
:यतो यतो निश्चरति मनश्चञ्चलमस्थिरम् |
:ततस्ततो नियम्यैतदात्मन्येव वंश नयेत् ||
the word Chanchala used in the first line refers to the restless and the unsteady mind that wanders away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Holy Geeta|author=Chinmayananda|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=446|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVw_Rff7m7AC&amp;pg=PA446&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1TkoU4rWJs2HrgelpoHwAQ&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCTge#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dasam Granth]], which like the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] is an important book of [[Sikhism]], it is not composed in [[raga]]s (its first composition dates 1684 A.D.) tells us that ''Chanchala'' is the name a ''[[chhand]]'' or metre of sixteen syllables having ''ragan'', ''jagan'', ''ragan'', ''jagan'' and ''laghu'' consecutively in each quarter, this metre is also known as ''Chitra'', ''Biraj and ''Brahmrupak'', and has been used twice in ''Choubis Autar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dasam Granth|author=S.S.Kapoor|publisher=Hemkunt Press|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-h8ptzp0lUC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uD0oU_G0IYayrgfn2IBQ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBjha#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In theology==

''Chanchala'', meaning, 'the fickle-fortune', is one of the many names of [[Lakshmi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Hinduism Vol.3|publisher=Sarup&amp;Sons|page=788|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wNQ82_yYeK8C&amp;pg=PA788&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mTwoU9PQN4KMrgeh0IDQAQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBjhG#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no mention of ''Lakshmi'' in the [[Rig Veda]]. [[Lakshmi|Sri]] of the Rig Veda is deified as a personified being in the [[Yajurveda]], and in the [[Atharvaveda]] (I.18) she is prayed to secure prosperity. ''Jatavedas Agni'' is repeatedly asked to make the goddess come to the votary; the epithet ''anapagamini'' reflects the ''chanchala'' i.e. fleet or fickle aspect of the goddess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Goddesses in Ancient India|author=Prithvi Kumar Agrawal |publisher=Abhinav Publications|pages=92–97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FHvf59ceLEC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FzwoU5f0DouMrgfU0IFI&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBDhG#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lakshmi'' or ''Chanchala'' as the mobile one associates only with the rich and the dynamic, no matter what their caste, creed or colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Devi: Tales of the Goddess of Our Time|author=Mrinala Pande|publisher=Penguin Books|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1TLsJW-WInIC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8TgoU_2hEoWyrAekvoDQBw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because ''Lakshmi'' is ''chanchala'' i.e. quick on her feet, to make her ''achala'' i.e. 'immobile', she needs to be worshipped quietly so that she does not get distracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Age Purohit Darpan: Lakshmi Puja|publisher=Associatian of Grandparents of Indian Migrants|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OxMvAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TT4oU8jnC8e-rgfq14DgCg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwADhu#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

References to an '''expulsion of Jews from Rome''' by the Roman Emperor [[Claudius]], who was in office AD 41-54, appear in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#18:2|18:2]]), and in the writings of [[Roman historiography|Roman historians]] [[Suetonius]] (c. AD 69 – c. AD 122), [[Cassius Dio]] (c. AD 150 – c. 235) and fifth-century Christian author [[Paulus Orosius]]. Scholars generally agree that these references refer to the same incident.&lt;ref name=Reisner13&gt;[[Rainer Riesner]] "Pauline Chronology" in Stephen Westerholm ''The Blackwell Companion to Paul'' (May 16, 2011) {{ISBN|1405188448}} pp.13-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cradle110 &gt;Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=g-MG9sFLAz0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:9780805443653&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LwKCU76QGYiXyASBv4LICQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=claudius&amp;f=false The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament]'' (2009) {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} p. 110, 400&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact date is uncertain. The maximal time window for the expulsion of Jews from Rome is from January AD 41 until January AD 53. More detailed estimates such as those based on the AD 49 date by Orosius or the reduction of the AD 53 upper limit due to Proconsul [[Lucius Junius Gallio Annaeanus|Gallio's]] health are possible but controversial.

There were at least two expulsions of Jews from Rome before this event. In 139 BC the Jews were expelled after being accused of [[Conversion to Judaism|Judaizing]] among the local [[Gentile]]s. Then in AD 19 [[Tiberius]] once again expelled Jews from the city for similar reasons.

==Context==
There were at least two expulsions of Jews from Rome before the reign of the Roman Emperor Claudius. In 139 BC the Jews were expelled after being accused of aggressive missionary efforts. Then in AD 19 [[Tiberius]] once again expelled Jews from the city for similar reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Van Voorst, Jesus, 2000. pp. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acts of the Apostles==
The author of the Acts of the Apostles ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#18:1-18|18:1-18]]) explains how the [[Apostle Paul]] met [[Priscilla and Aquila]]&lt;ref name=Cradle110 /&gt; and mentions in passing an expulsion of Jews from Rome:

{{quote|After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth. 2 There he met a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see them, 3 and because he was a tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them. 4 Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.

5 When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah. 6 But when they opposed Paul and became abusive, he shook out his clothes in protest and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent of it. From now on I will go to the Gentiles."

7 Then Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titius Justus, a worshiper of God. 8 Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his entire household believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and were baptized.

9 One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: "Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent. 10 For I am with you, and no one is going to attack and harm you, because I have many people in this city." 11 So Paul stayed in Corinth for a year and a half, teaching them the word of God.

12 While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews of Corinth made a united attack on Paul and brought him to the place of judgment. 13 "This man," they charged, "is persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the law."

14 Just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to them, "If you Jews were making a complaint about some misdemeanor or serious crime, it would be reasonable for me to listen to you. 15 But since it involves questions about words and names and your own law—settle the matter yourselves. I will not be a judge of such things." 16 So he drove them off. 17 Then the crowd there turned on Sosthenes the synagogue leader and beat him in front of the proconsul; and Gallio showed no concern whatever.

18 Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time. Then he left the brothers and sisters and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila.}}

===Dating Acts by reference to Gallio or to Orosius===
[[File:The Temple of Apollo at Delphi.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]], where the [[Delphi Inscription]] was discovered in the 20th century, used to date the proconsulship of Gallio which provides a peg for the chronology of Paul.&lt;ref&gt;''The Letters of Paul: An Introduction'' by Charles B. Puskas (Aug 3, 1993) {{ISBN|0814656900}} page 20 states: "The document of primary importance in determining a chronology of Paul is the Gallio Inscription found at Delphi"&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A fairly precise date for Acts 18:1-18 is derived from the mention of the [[proconsul]] [[Lucius Junius Gallio Annaeanus|Gallio]] in 18:12 and the existence of an [[Delphi Inscription|inscription]] found at [[Delphi]] and published in 1905,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gallio Inscription|url=http://www.wfu.edu/~horton/r102/gallio.html|accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; preserving a letter from Claudius concerning Gallio dated during the 26th acclamation of Claudius, sometime between January 51 and August 52.&lt;ref&gt;John B. Polhill, ''Paul and His Letters'', B&amp;H Publishing Group, 1999, {{ISBN|9780805410976}}, p.78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralph Novak states that the Delphi inscription clearly indicates that Gallio did not assume office any earlier than the spring of 50, adds that he may have served one or two years, and uses that to compute date ranges.&lt;ref name=Novak18/&gt; Working from a date prior to August AD 52 for the Gallio inscription, Novak considers the possibility that Gallio served for two years and calculates a possible range for Gallio's term of office from late spring of AD 50 to early summer of AD 54 depending on whether the inscription reflects a date late in Gallio's consulship or early. Slingerland accepts a wide date range for Paul's trial similar to that of Novak for Gallio's consulship and states that Paul could have arrived in Corinth up to 18 months earlier than the earliest possible start of Gallio's term of office or a short time before the end of Gallio's latest date.&lt;ref&gt;Slingerland, 'Orosius', JQR 83, 1/2 (1992), p.134.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Udo Schnelle]] specifies that the reign of Gallio started in the summer of 51,&lt;ref name=Udo49&gt;''Apostle Paul: His Life and Theology'' by Udo Schnelle 2005 {{ISBN|0801027969}} page 49. See also ''The Book of Acts'' by F. F. Bruce 1998 {{ISBN|0802825052}} page 352 and ''The Greco-Roman World of the New Testament Era'' by James S. Jeffers (Oct 7, 1999) {{ISBN|0830815899}} page 164&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Craig S. Keener]] pinpoints the start of his term to July 51, although some scholars prefer 52.&lt;ref name=Keener51&gt;Craig S. Keener in ''The Blackwell Companion to Paul'' edited by Stephen Westerholm 2011 {{ISBN|1405188448}} page 51&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent dating of Acts is sometimes based on a controversial AD 49 date for Claudius's edict, reported by [[Orosius]] (see section on Paulus Orosius below): According to Novak, if Claudius's edict were issued in January of 49 and Paul came to Corinth and met Aquila and Priscilla, within six or so months of the edict, then an eighteen-month stay in Corinth would indicate a date after late spring of 50 and many days before January of 51 for Paul's trial.&lt;ref name=Novak18/&gt; At the other extreme, if Claudius's edict were issued in December of 49, using the same reasoning, the date of Paul's trial would be many days before the January of 52.&lt;ref name=Novak18/&gt; Michael R. Cosby states that the dates 49-50 for the expulsion of Jews from Rome support the date from the trial of Paul in Corinth, and are consistent with the account of the activities of Priscilla and Aquila given in Acts 18:24-26.&lt;ref name=Cosby142 &gt;''Apostle on the Edge: An Inductive Approach to Paul'' by Michael R. Cosby (Oct 20, 2009) {{ISBN|0664233082}} pages 142-143. See also ''Introduction to the New Testament'' by [[Raymond E. Brown]] (30 Nov 1997) {{ISBN|0385247672}} page 433 and ''Introducing Romans: Critical Issues in Paul's Most Famous Letter'' by Richard N. Longenecker (Mar 25, 2011) {{ISBN|0802866190}} pages 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, the maximal time window for the expulsion of Jews from Rome is January AD 41 (the accession of Claudius) until January AD 53 (18 months prior to the latest possible end of Gallio's term and thus the latest date for Paul's trial). More detailed estimates such as those based on the AD 49 date of Orosius are possible but controversial.

===The health of Gallio===
Gallio's brother Seneca reports in [[Wikisource:Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 104|''Moral Epistles'' 104.1]] that Gallio ''began to develop a fever in Achaia and took ship at once, insisting that the disease was not of the body but of the place''. Furthermore, [[Pliny the Elder]] states in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' 31.33 that ''There are besides many other uses, the chief being a sea voyage for those attacked by [[Tuberculosis|consumption]], as I have said, and for [[haemoptysis]], such as quite recently within our memory was taken by Annæus Gallio after his consulship.''&lt;ref&gt;Plinius ''Natural History'' Book 31 chapter 33, translation by WHS Jones (1963) William Heinemann, London, 1963, p417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alternative translation ''There are numerous other medicinal resources derived from the sea; the benefit of a sea-voyage, more particularly, in cases of phthisis, as already mentioned, and where patients are suffering from hæmoptosis [hæmoptysis], as lately experienced, in our own memory, by Annæus Gallio, at the close of his consulship'' [http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=PerseusLatinTexts&amp;getid=1&amp;query=Plin.%20Nat.%2031.33].&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on these references, [[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]] and a number of other scholars conclude that it is likely that the tenure of Gallio in Corinth lasted less than a full year, and due to health reasons Gallio left Corinth earlier, perhaps even before shipping on the Mediterranean stopped in October 51 due to winter storms.&lt;ref&gt;"Pauline Chronology" by [[Rainer Riesner]] ''The Blackwell Companion to Paul'' edited by Stephen Westerholm (May 16, 2011) {{ISBN|1405188448}} page 14. ''The Language of Belonging'' by Mary Katherine Birge (Dec 1, 2002) {{ISBN|9042911026}} page 3. Jerome Murphy-O'Connor "Paul and Gallio" Journal of Biblical Literature [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3267232?uid=3738296&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101196183337 Vol. 112, No. 2, 1993]. ''The First Epistle to the Corinthians'' by Anthony C Thiselton 2000 {{ISBN|0853645590}} pages 29-30. ''Apostle on the Edge: An Inductive Approach to Paul'' by Michael R. Cosby (Oct 20, 2009) {{ISBN|0664233082}} page 76&lt;/ref&gt;  He argues that "it is impossible" to place Paul's trial by Gallio in the latter part of AD 51-52 and the trial must have happened between July when Gallio arrived in Corinth and September of 51.&lt;ref name=JMO21 &gt;''Paul: A Critical Life'' by J. Murphy-O'Connor (Sep 3, 1998) {{ISBN|0192853422}} pages 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy-O'Connor adds that this has "positive confirmation" in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#2:1|Galatians 2:1]] which "places Paul in Jerusalem in AD 51".&lt;ref name=JMO21 /&gt;

On the other hand, Pliny the Elder refers to only one sea cure by Gallio which was after he was consul presumably around AD 55,&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Haacker states, "Both Seneca and Plinius mention a sea voyage which Gallio chose as an immediate remedy against symptoms of phthisis when he was in Greece (not during his proconsulship as some modern writers wrongly assume)". Klaus Haacker, "Gallio", entry in the ''Anchor Bible Dictionary'' (Doubleday, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"L. Junius Annaeus Gallio, was suffect consul in the mid-50s AD, perhaps in 54." Robert C. Knapp, ''Roman Córdoba'' (University of California Press, 1992) {{ISBN|9780520096769}} p.42. "L. Junius Gallio did hold consulship in 55 or 56". Anthony Barrett, ''Agrippina: Sex, Power and Politics in the Early Empire'' (Routledge, 1999) {{ISBN|9780415208673}} p.280. "Gallio reached the consulship, probably in 55". Miriam T. Griffin, ''Nero: The End of a Dynasty'' (Routledge, 1987) {{ISBN|0415214645}} p.78. See also Wikipedia: [[List of Roman consuls#1st century AD|List of Roman consuls]] and [[List of state leaders in 56]].&lt;/ref&gt; and neither Seneca nor Pliny explicitly suggest that Gallio deserted his Achaea posting not to return.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Winter, "Rehabilitating Gallio and his Judgement in Acts 18:14-15" ''Tyndale Bulletin'' 57.2 (2006), pp.298-299.&lt;/ref&gt; Slingerland states that an argument regarding the shortening of Gallio's stay in Achaea due to health issues is "speculative".&lt;ref&gt;Slingerland, 'Gallio',  JBL 110, 3, p.446.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dating problems===
Some scholars indicate difficulties trying to use Acts for strict chronological indications. Collins and Harrington state that Luke's account may be a conflation of various traditions and not entirely accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond F. Collins, Daniel J. Harrington, ''First Corinthians'' (Liturgical Press, 1993) {{ISBN|9780814658093}} p.24.&lt;/ref&gt; Jerome Murphy-O'Connor indicates that Acts 18 is "much less precise than appears at first sight." The expulsion was from Rome, but Aquila and Priscilla came from Italy, so they may have stayed in Italy after the expulsion, how long "no-one can say". He also questions the exactitude of what is meant by "recently"/"lately".&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Murphy-O'Connor, ''St. Paul's Corinth: Text and Archaeology'' (Liturgical Press, 2002) {{ISBN|9780814653036}} p.159.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suetonius==
{{Main|Suetonius on Christians}}
A brief statement in [[wikisource:The Lives of the Twelve Caesars/Claudius#25|''Divus Claudius'' 25]] mentions agitations by the [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire#Jews in Rome and Romans in Jerusalem|"Jews"]] which led [[Claudius]] (Roman Emperor from AD 41 to 54) to expel them from Rome:

{{quote|Since the Jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus, he [the Emperor Claudius] expelled them from Rome.}}

The expulsion event Suetonius refers to is necessarily later than AD 41,&lt;ref&gt;[[Rainer Riesner]], "Pauline Chronology" in ''The Blackwell Companion to Paul'', Stephen Westerholm (ed.) (Blackwell, 2011) {{ISBN|1405188448}} p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; and earlier than AD 54. The expulsion is mentioned in the last quarter of a list of Claudius's actions during his reign. However, precisely dating the expulsion from Suetonius provides some challenges because Suetonius writes in a topical rather than chronological fashion, necessitating the use of other texts to pinpoint the time.&lt;ref name=Dix306&gt;Slingerland, 'Suetonius "Claudius" 25.4 and the Account in Cassius Dio', ''JQR'' 79, 4, p.306&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jerry152/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reisner13/&gt; The dating of the "edict of Claudius" for the expulsion of Jews relies on three separate texts beyond Suetonius' own reference, which in chronological order are: the reference to the trial of Apostle Paul by Gallio in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#18:2|18:2]]),&lt;ref name=Jerry152&gt;Jerome Murphy-O'Connor ''St. Paul's Corinth: Texts and Archaeology'' (Aug 1, 2002) {{ISBN|0814653030}} p.152&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cassius Dio]]'s reference in History 60.6.6-7, and [[Paulus Orosius]]'s fifth century mention in History 7.6.15-16 of a non-extant Josephus reference. Most scholars agree that the expulsion of Jews mentioned in the [[Book of Acts]]&lt;ref name=Cradle110 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak18&gt;''Christianity and the Roman Empire: background texts'' by Ralph Martin Novak 2001 {{ISBN|1-56338-347-0}} pages 18-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Keener51/&gt; is consistent with this report by Suetonius. Donna Hurley notes that Acts provides a date of 49, but adds that neither Tacitus nor Dio "reports an expulsion in 49 or 50 as would be expected if there had been a large exodus of the Jewish community", concluding that '"all" is probably a hyperbole.'&lt;ref&gt;Donna W. Hurley (ed.), ''Suetonius: Diuus Claudius'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001) {{ISBN|9780521596763}} p.177.&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage may suggest that in the mid-first century the Romans still viewed Christianity as a [[Jewish Christianity|Jewish sect]]. Historians debate whether or not the Roman government distinguished between [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|Christians and Jews]] prior to [[Nerva]]'s modification of the [[Fiscus Judaicus]] in AD 96. From then on, practising Jews paid the tax, Christians did not.&lt;ref name=fiscjud&gt;Wylen, Stephen M., ''The Jews in the Time of Jesus: An Introduction'', Paulist Press (1995), {{ISBN|0-8091-3610-4}}, pp.190-192; Dunn, James D.G., ''Jews and Christians: The Parting of the Ways, 70 to 135'', Wm.

Silvia Cappelletti describes Claudius's motivation as the need to control the population of Rome and prevent political meetings. (He "did not have an anti-Jewish policy.")&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Cappelletti, ''The Jewish Community of Rome'' (Leiden: Brill, 2006) {{ISBN|9789004151574}} p.82.&lt;/ref&gt; Donna Hurley explains that Suetonius includes the expulsion "among problems with foreign populations, not among religions"&lt;ref&gt;Donna W. Hurley (ed.), ''Suetonius: Diuus Claudius'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001) {{ISBN|9780521596763}} p.176.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis Feldman]] states that most scholars assume that the disturbances were due to the [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|spread of Christianity in Rome]].&lt;ref name=Feldman332&gt;Louis H. Feldman, ''Jewish Life and Thought among Greeks and Romans'' (Oct 1, 1996) {{ISBN|0567085252}} p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; Dunn states that the disturbances Suetonius refers to were probably caused by the objections of Jewish community to preachings by early Christians; Dunn moreover perceives confusion in Suetonius which would weaken the historical value of the reference as a whole.&lt;ref name=Dunn141&gt;James D. G. Dunn ''Jesus Remembered'' (2003) {{ISBN|0-8028-3931-2}} pp. 141-143&lt;/ref&gt; Lane states that the cause of the disturbance was likely the preachings of Hellenistic Jews in Rome and their insistence that Jesus was the Messiah, resulting in tensions with the Jews in Rome.&lt;ref name=Lane204 &gt;William L. Lane in ''Judaism and Christianity in First-Century Rome'' edited by Karl Paul Donfried and Peter Richardson (1998) {{ISBN|0802842658}} pp. 204-206&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, E.A. Judge states that Suetonius later introduces Christians "in a way that leaves no doubt that he is discussing them for the first time" (i.e. in Nero 16), bringing into doubt an interpretation that Suetonius is dealing with Christians in Claudius 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E. A. Judge|editor=James R. Harrison|title=The First Christians in the Roman World: Augustan and New Testament Essays|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|year=2008|ISBN=9783161493102}} p.446.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars are divided on the identity of "Chrestus" in the Suetonius reference. Some such as [[Craig A. Evans]], [[John P. Meier|John Meier]] and [[Craig S. Keener]] see it as a likely reference to Jesus.&lt;ref name=BoydE166&gt;Eddy, Paul; Boyd, Gregory. ''The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition'' (2007) {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}} pages 166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gospels' page 66"&gt;Craig S. Keener, ''The Historical Jesus of the Gospels'' (2012) {{ISBN|0802868886}} p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Menahem Stern said Suetonius was definitely referring to Jesus Christ, because he would have added "a certain" to Chrestus, if he had meant some unknown agitator.&lt;ref&gt;Menahem Stern, Jerusalem, 1980, Greek and Latin Authors on Jews and Judaism vol. 2 , p 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars disagree: Stephen Benko sees "Chrestus" as an otherwise unknown agitator in Rome, whereas H. Dixon Slingerland sees him as someone who influenced Claudius to expel Jews.&lt;ref name="impchre"&gt;D. Slingerland, "Chrestus: Christus?" in A. J. Avery-Peck, ''New Perspectives on Ancient Judaism'' 4 (Lanham: University Press of America, 1989) {{ISBN|9780819171795}} p.143. The same view has been espoused by Neil Elliot, ("''impulsore Chresto'' probably refers to "Chrestus" having prompted Claudius' expulsion, not the Jews' disturbances": Neil Elliot, "The Letter to the Romans" in R. S. Sugirtharajah and Fernando F. Segovia (eds.) ''A Postcolonial Commentary on the New Testament Writings'' (T.&amp; T.Clark, 2009) {{ISBN|9780567637079}} p.198) and Ian Rock ("there is sufficient reason to believe that either Chrestus may have been the impulsor to Claudius given the evidence that powerful freedmen influenced Claudius' decisions": Ian E.

==Cassius Dio==
[[Cassius Dio]] makes a comment in 60.6.6-7 regarding an action early in the reign of Claudius:&lt;ref name=Dix306/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jerry152/&gt;

{{quote|As for the Jews, who had again increased so greatly that by reason of their multitude it would have been hard without raising a tumult to bar them from the city [Rome], he [Claudius] did not drive them out, but ordered them, while continuing their traditional mode of life, not to hold meetings.}}

The similarities are noteworthy, for both Suetonius and Cassius Dio deal with Jews, tumult, Claudius, the city and expulsion,&lt;ref&gt;Slingerland, 'Cassius Dio', ''JQR'' 79, 4, p.316&lt;/ref&gt; and Cassius Dio does provide a chronological context that points to the year AD 41.&lt;ref&gt;Slingerland, 'Cassius Dio', ''JQR'' 79, 4, (1988) p.307&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cassius Dio does not mention Chrestus or any cause for the emperor's actions. Moreover, Cassius Dio says that Claudius ''did not'' drive the Jews out of the city, which prompts Slingerland to conclude that "Suetonius Claudius 25.4 does not refer to the event narrated in Dio 60.6.6-7." [[Rainer Riesner]] states that ancient historians generally hold that Cassius Dio here may have referred to an earlier, more limited action against some Jews, which was later expanded by Claudius to the expulsion of a larger group of Jews.&lt;ref name=Reisner13/&gt;

Raymond E. Brown states that Dio specifically rejects a general expulsion and it would be more reasonable to assume that only the most vocal people on either side of the Christ issue were expelled.&lt;ref name=Brown102&gt;Raymond E. Brown and John P. Meier ''Antioch and Rome'' (May 1983) {{ISBN|0809125323}} page 102&lt;/ref&gt; Feldman states that the expulsion mentioned by Dio refers to the same event in Suetonius, but had a limited nature.&lt;ref name=Feldman304/&gt; Feldman states that given that Claudius' Jewish friend [[Agrippa I]] had been helpful in his ascent to the throne as in Ant 19.236-44, and given Claudius' actions in Ant 20.10-14 it seems hard to believe that Claudius would have expelled all the Jews due to a single agitator, soon after assuming the throne.&lt;ref name=Feldman304&gt;''Jew and Gentile in the Ancient World'' by Louis H. Feldman (Oct 14, 1996) {{ISBN|069102927X}} page 304&lt;/ref&gt; Feldman states that the most likely explanation is that Claudius at first either expelled only the Christians or restricted public assembly by the Jews.&lt;ref name=Feldman304/&gt;

In general, Cassius Dio does not use the word "Christian" in his ''Roman History'', and appears not to distinguish (or unable to distinguish) Jews from Christians. Given this viewpoint, the large Christian population in Rome that Cassius Dio witnesses in his own time (up to AD 229) would appear to him to conflict with any historical reports of massive Jewish expulsions, such as that of AD 41. Thus providing the reason for Cassius Dio convincing himself that Jewish expulsions had not happened.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous Christian layman, 19 Nov 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paulus Orosius==
[[File:Paulo Orosio - Lámina siglo VI.jpg|thumb|250px|A page from a sixth-century [[Paulus Orosius]] ''Histories'' manuscript, [[Florence]].]]
The 5th-century Christian writer [[Orosius|Paulus Orosius]] makes a possible reference to the event, citing two sources:

{{quote|Josephus reports, 'In his ninth year the Jews were expelled by Claudius from the city.' But Suetonius, who speaks as follows, influences me more: 'Claudius expelled from Rome the Jews constantly rioting at the instigation of Christ [Christo, or rather ''xpo''].' As far as whether he had commanded that the Jews rioting against Christ [Christum] be restrained and checked or also had wanted the Christians, as persons of a cognate religion, to be expelled, it is not at all to be discerned.&lt;ref&gt;Historiarum adversum paganos libri VII 7.6.15-16, cited in Slingerland, 'Orosius', JQR 83, 1/2 (1992), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first source used by Orosius comes from a non-extant quote from Josephus.&lt;ref name="oro137"&gt;Slingerland, 'Orosius', JQR 83, 1/2 (1992), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; It is this which provides the date of AD 49. His second source is Suetonius Claudius 25.4.

Slingerland contends that Orosius made up the Josephus passage for which no scholar has been able to discover a source.&lt;ref&gt;Slingerland, 'Orosius', JQR 83, 1/2 (1992), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; He also argues that the writer is guilty of manipulating source materials for polemic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Slingerland, 'Orosius', JQR 83, 1/2 (1992), pp. 139-141.&lt;/ref&gt; Feldman states that "there is no such statement in the extant manuscripts of Josephus, and there is reason to believe that this version was created in the mind of Orosius himself."&lt;ref&gt;Louis H. Feldman, ''Jew and Gentile in the Ancient World: Attitudes and Interactions From Alexander To Justinian'' (Princeton University Press, 1996) {{ISBN|9780691029276}} p.304.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Esler agrees with Slingerland that the AD 49 date "is a creation fully explicable within the tendentious historiography of this author."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Francis Esler, ''Conflict and Identity in Romans: The Social Setting of Paul's Letter'' (Augsburg Fortress, 2004) {{ISBN|9780800634353}} p.99.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, E. M. Smallwood states that Orosius may have known of a passage from another author but confused the Josephus passage with it, or may have been quoting from memory.&lt;ref name=EMSmall210&gt;E. Mary Smallwood, ''The Jews Under Roman Rule: From Pompey to Diocletian'' (Oct 1, 2001) {{ISBN|039104155X}} pp. 210-211&lt;/ref&gt; Silvia Cappelletti states that the change in spelling was probably not due to Orosius but to an intermediate source he consulted.&lt;ref name=Silvia73 &gt;''The Jewish Community in Rome: From the Second Century B. C. to the Third Century C. E.'' by Silvia Cappelletti (Aug 1, 2006) {{ISBN|9004151575}} pp. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; Cappelletti also states that the lack of the Josephus text referred to does not undermine the authority of the date Orosius has suggested.&lt;ref name=Silvia73 /&gt; Brown tactfully states, "Orosius is not famous for his impeccable accuracy," then adds that "such a date" (i.e. 49) "receives some confirmation from Acts."&lt;ref name=Brown102/&gt; Bernard Green states that given that this section of Orosius' history is based on the chronological order of events, and that he refers to the expulsion only briefly and attaches no significance to it, Orosius seems to be "guiltlessly reporting" an event based on records he had seen.&lt;ref name=bgreen&gt;''Christianity in Ancient Rome: The First Three Centuries'' by Bernard Green (Apr 15, 2010) {{ISBN|0567032507}} page 25&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rainer Riesner]] notes that it is not possible for Orosius to have derived the date of the expulsion that he wrote about from the [[Book of Acts]].&lt;ref name=Reisner13/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29810">In [[physics]], two wave sources are perfectly coherent if they have a constant [[phase difference]] and the same [[frequency]], and the same [[waveform]]. Coherence is an ideal property of [[wave]]s that enables stationary (i.e. temporally and spatially constant) [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]]. It contains several distinct concepts, which are limiting cases that never quite occur in reality but allow an understanding of the physics of waves, and has become a very important concept in quantum physics. More generally, '''coherence''' describes all properties of the [[correlation function|correlation]] between [[physical quantities]] of a single wave, or between several waves or wave packets.

Interference is the addition, in the mathematical sense, of wave functions. A single wave can interfere with itself, but this is still an addition of two waves (see [[Young's interference experiment|Young's slits experiment]]). Constructive or destructive interferences are limit cases, and two waves always interfere, even if the result of the addition is complicated or not remarkable.

When interfering, two waves can add together to create a wave of greater amplitude than either one ([[constructive interference]]) or subtract from each other to create a wave of lesser amplitude than either one ([[destructive interference]]), depending on their relative [[phase (waves)|phase]]. Two waves are said to be coherent if they have a constant relative phase. The amount of coherence can readily be measured by the [[interference visibility]], which looks at the size of the interference fringes relative to the input waves (as the phase offset is varied); a precise mathematical definition of the [[degree of coherence]] is given by means of correlation functions.

Spatial coherence describes the correlation (or predictable relationship) between waves at different points in space, either lateral or longitudinal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hecht|title=Optics|date=1998|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman|isbn=0-201-83887-7|pages=554–574|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temporal coherence describes the correlation between waves observed at different moments in time. Both are observed in the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] and [[Young's interference experiment]]. Once the fringes are obtained in the [[Michelson interferometer]], when one of the mirrors is moved away gradually, the time for the beam to travel increases and the fringes become dull and finally are showing temporal coherence. Similarly, if in a [[double-slit experiment]], the space between the two slits is increased, the coherence dies gradually and finally the fringes disappear, showing spatial coherence.  In both cases, the fringe amplitude slowly disappears, as the path difference increases past the coherence length.

==Introduction==
Coherence was originally conceived in connection with [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]'s [[double-slit experiment]] in [[optics]] but is now used in any field that involves waves, such as [[acoustics]], [[electrical engineering]], [[neuroscience]], and [[quantum mechanics]]. Coherence describes the statistical similarity of a field (electromagnetic field, quantum wave packet etc.) at two points in space or time&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/149011826|title=Introduction to the theory of coherence and polarization of light|last=Emil.|first=Wolf,|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521822114|location=Cambridge|oclc=149011826}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The property of coherence is the basis for commercial applications such as [[holography]], the [[Sagnac interferometer|Sagnac]] [[gyroscope]], radio [[Phased array|antenna array]]s, [[optical coherence tomography]] and telescope interferometers ([[Interferometry#Astronomical optical interferometry|astronomical optical interferometers]] and [[radio telescope]]s).

==Mathematical definition==

A precise definition is given at [[degree of coherence]].

The coherence function between two signals &lt;math&gt; x(t) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; y(t) &lt;/math&gt; is defined as&lt;ref&gt;Shin. K, Hammond. J.'' Fundamentals of signal processing for sound and vibration engineers''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma_{xy}^{2}(f)=\frac{|S_{xy}(f)|^2}{S_{xx}(f)S_{yy}(f)}&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt; S_{xy}(f) &lt;/math&gt; is the [[cross-spectral density]] of the signal and &lt;math&gt; S_{xx}(f) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; S_{yy}(f) &lt;/math&gt; are the power [[spectral density]] functions of &lt;math&gt; x(t) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; y(t) &lt;/math&gt;, respectively. The cross-spectral density and the power spectral density are defined as the [[Fourier transforms]] of the [[cross-correlation]] and the [[autocorrelation]] signals, respectively. For instance, if the signals are functions of time, the cross-correlation is a measure of the similarity of the two signals as a function of the time lag relative to each other and the autocorrelation is a measure of the similarity of each signal with itself in different instants of time. In this case the coherence is a function of frequency. Analogously, if &lt;math&gt; x(t) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; y(t) &lt;/math&gt; are functions of space, the cross-correlation measures the similarity of two signals in different points in space and the autocorrelations the similarity of the signal relative to itself for a certain separation distance.  In that case, coherence is a function of [[wavenumber]] (spatial frequency).

The coherence varies in the interval &lt;math&gt; 0\leqslant \gamma_{xy}^{2}(f)\leqslant 1. &lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt; \gamma_{xy}^{2}(f)=1 &lt;/math&gt; it means that the signals are perfectly correlated or linearly related and if &lt;math&gt; \gamma_{xy}^{2}(f)=0 &lt;/math&gt; they are totally uncorrelated. If a linear system is being measured, &lt;math&gt; x(t) &lt;/math&gt; being the input and &lt;math&gt; y(t) &lt;/math&gt; the output, the coherence function will be unitary all over the spectrum. However, if non-linearities are present in the system the coherence will vary in the limit given above.

==Coherence and correlation==
The coherence of two waves expresses how well correlated the waves are as quantified by the [[cross-correlation]] function.&lt;ref name="winter"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cross-correlation quantifies the ability to predict the phase of the second wave by knowing the phase of the first. As an example, consider two waves perfectly correlated for all times. At any time, phase difference will be constant.{{clarify|reason=Correlation appears to be used in a sloppy way here. If they always change the same way, how can they exhibit destructive interference? Is correlation the expectation value of the product ⟨X Y⟩? This is not at all the ability to predict X from Y. In particular, a perfectly coherent 1/4 cycle phase difference will allow perfect prediction but yield zero correlation.|date=May 2015}} If, when combined, they exhibit perfect constructive interference, perfect destructive interference, or something in-between but with constant phase difference, then it follows that they are perfectly coherent. As will be discussed below, the second wave need not be a separate entity. It could be the first wave at a different time or position. In this case, the measure of correlation is the [[autocorrelation]] function (sometimes called '''self-coherence'''). Degree of correlation involves correlation functions.{{R|Hecht2002|page=545-550}}

==Examples of wave-like states==
These states are unified by the fact that their behavior is described by a [[wave equation]] or some generalization thereof.
*Waves in a rope (up and down) or [[slinky]] (compression and expansion)
*[[Surface waves]] in a liquid
*[[Electromagnetic]] signals (fields) in [[transmission line]]s
*[[Sound]]
*[[Radio wave]]s and [[Microwaves]]
*[[Light wave]]s ([[optics]])
*[[Electron]]s, [[atom]]s and any other object (such as a baseball), as described by [[quantum physics]]

In most of these systems, one can measure the wave directly. Consequently, its correlation with another wave can simply be calculated. However, in optics one cannot measure the [[electric field]] directly as it oscillates much faster than any detector's time resolution.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, we measure the [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] of the light. Most of the concepts involving coherence which will be introduced below were developed in the field of optics and then used in other fields. Therefore, many of the standard measurements of coherence are indirect measurements, even in fields where the wave can be measured directly.

Temporal coherence is the measure of the average correlation between the value of a wave and itself delayed by τ, at any pair of times. Temporal coherence tells us how monochromatic a source is. In other words, it characterizes how well a wave can interfere with itself at a different time. The delay over which the phase or amplitude wanders by a significant amount (and hence the correlation decreases by significant amount) is defined as the [[coherence time]] ''τ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''. At a delay of τ=0 the degree of coherence is perfect, whereas it drops significantly as the delay passes ''τ=τ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''. The [[coherence length]] ''L&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined as the distance the wave travels in time τ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hecht2002"&gt;{{citation|last =Hecht |first=Eugene|title=Optics|year=2002| location=United States of America | publisher=Addison Wesley| edition= 4th| isbn=0-8053-8566-5 | language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|560, 571–573}}

One should be careful not to confuse the coherence time with the time duration of the signal, nor the coherence length with the coherence area (see below).

===The relationship between coherence time and bandwidth===
It can be shown that the larger the range of frequencies Δf a wave contains, the faster the wave decorrelates (and hence the smaller τ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is). Thus there is a tradeoff:{{R|Hecht2002|page=358-359, 560}}

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_c \Delta f \lesssim 1&lt;/math&gt;.

Formally, this follows from the [[convolution theorem]] in mathematics, which relates the [[Fourier transform]] of the power spectrum (the intensity of each frequency) to its [[autocorrelation]].{{R|Hecht2002|page=572}}

===Examples of temporal coherence===
We consider four examples of temporal coherence. 
*A wave containing only a single frequency (monochromatic) is perfectly correlated with itself at all time delays, in accordance with the above relation. (See Figure 1)
*Conversely, a wave whose phase drifts quickly will have a short coherence time. (See Figure 2)
*Similarly, pulses ([[wave packet]]s) of waves, which naturally have a broad range of frequencies, also have a short coherence time since the amplitude of the wave changes quickly. (See Figure 3)
*Finally, white light, which has a very broad range of frequencies, is a wave which varies quickly in both amplitude and phase. Since it consequently has a very short coherence time (just 10 periods or so), it is often called incoherent.

Monochromatic sources are usually [[laser]]s; such high monochromaticity implies long coherence lengths (up to hundreds of meters). For example, a stabilized and monomode [[helium–neon laser]] can easily produce light with coherence lengths of 300 m.&lt;ref name=saleh-teich&gt;{{cite book|last=Saleh, Teich|title=Fundamentals of Photonics|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all lasers are monochromatic, however (e.g. for a mode-locked [[Ti-sapphire laser]], Δλ ≈ 2&amp;nbsp;nm - 70&amp;nbsp;nm). LEDs are characterized by Δλ ≈ 50&amp;nbsp;nm, and tungsten filament lights exhibit Δλ ≈ 600&amp;nbsp;nm, so these sources have shorter coherence times than the most monochromatic lasers.

[[Holography]] requires light with a long coherence time. In contrast, [[optical coherence tomography]], in its classical version, uses light with a short coherence time.

===Measurement of temporal coherence===
[[File:wave packets.png|thumb|400px|right|Figure 3: The amplitude of a wavepacket whose amplitude changes significantly in time τ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; (red) and a copy of the same wave delayed by 2τ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;(green) plotted as a function of time ''t''. At any particular time the red and green waves are uncorrelated; one oscillates while the other is constant and so there will be no interference at this delay. Another way of looking at this is the wavepackets are not overlapped in time and so at any particular time there is only one nonzero field so no interference can occur.]]
[[File:interference finite coherence.png|thumb|390px|right|Figure 4: The time-averaged intensity (blue) detected at the output of an interferometer plotted as a function of delay τ for the example waves in Figures 2 and 3. As the delay is changed by half a period, the interference switches between constructive and destructive. The black lines indicate the interference envelope, which gives the [[degree of coherence]]. Although the waves in Figures 2 and 3 have different time durations, they have the same coherence time.]]

In optics, temporal coherence is measured in an interferometer such as the [[Michelson interferometer]] or [[Mach–Zehnder interferometer]]. In these devices, a wave is combined with a copy of itself that is delayed by time τ. A detector measures the time-averaged [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] of the light exiting the interferometer. The resulting interference visibility (e.g. see Figure 4) gives the temporal coherence at delay τ. Since for most natural light sources, the coherence time is much shorter than the time resolution of any detector, the detector itself does the time averaging. Consider the example shown in Figure 3. At a fixed delay, here 2τ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, an infinitely fast detector would measure an intensity that fluctuates significantly over a time ''t'' equal to τ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. In this case, to find the temporal coherence at 2τ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, one would manually time-average the intensity.

==Spatial coherence==&lt;!--Spatial coherence redirects here--&gt;
In some systems, such as water waves or optics, wave-like states can extend over one or two dimensions. Spatial coherence describes the ability for two points in space, ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', in the extent of a wave to interfere, when averaged over time. More precisely, the spatial coherence is the [[cross-correlation]] between two points in a wave for all times. If a wave has only 1 value of amplitude over an infinite length, it is perfectly spatially coherent. The range of separation between the two points over which there is significant interference defines the diameter of the coherence area, ''A&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goodman|title=Statistical Optics|date=1985|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=0-471-01502-4|pages=210,221|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Coherence length, often a feature of a source, is usually an industrial term related to the coherence time of the source, not the coherence area in the medium.)  A&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the relevant type of coherence for the Young's double-slit interferometer. It is also used in optical imaging systems and particularly in various types of astronomy telescopes. Sometimes people also use "spatial coherence" to refer to the visibility when a wave-like state is combined with a spatially shifted copy of itself.

===Examples of spatial coherence===

Far from the pinhole the emerging spherical wavefronts are approximately flat. The coherence area is now infinite while the coherence length is unchanged.&lt;/small&gt;
File:spatial coherence detector.png|&lt;small&gt;Figure 9: A wave with infinite coherence area is combined with a spatially shifted copy of itself. Some sections in the wave interfere constructively and some will interfere destructively. Averaging over these sections, a detector with length D will measure reduced [[interference visibility]]. For example, a misaligned [[Mach–Zehnder interferometer]] will do this.&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Consider a tungsten light-bulb filament. Different points in the filament emit light independently and have no fixed phase-relationship. In detail, at any point in time the profile of the emitted light is going to be distorted. The profile will change randomly over the coherence time &lt;math&gt;\tau_c&lt;/math&gt;. Since for a white-light source such as a light-bulb &lt;math&gt;\tau_c&lt;/math&gt; is small, the filament is considered a spatially incoherent source. In contrast, a radio [[Phased array|antenna array]], has large spatial coherence because antennas at opposite ends of the array emit with a fixed phase-relationship. Light waves produced by a laser often have high temporal and spatial coherence (though the degree of coherence depends strongly on the exact properties of the laser). Spatial coherence of laser beams also manifests itself as speckle patterns and diffraction fringes seen at the edges of shadow.

Holography requires temporally and spatially coherent light. Its inventor, [[Dennis Gabor]], produced successful holograms more than ten years before lasers were invented. To produce coherent light he passed the monochromatic light from an emission line of a [[mercury-vapor lamp]] through a pinhole spatial filter.

In February 2011 it was reported that [[helium]] atoms, cooled to near [[absolute zero]] / [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] state, can be made to flow and behave as a coherent beam as occurs in a laser.&lt;ref&gt;

==Spectral coherence==
[[File:Coherent superposition.svg|thumb|right|350px|Figure 10: Waves of different frequencies interfere to form a localized pulse if they are coherent.]]
[[File:spectral coherence continuous.png|thumb|right|350px|Figure 11: Spectrally incoherent light interferes to form continuous light with a randomly varying phase and amplitude]]

Waves of different frequencies (in light these are different colours) can interfere to form a pulse if they have a fixed relative phase-relationship (see [[Fourier transform]]). Conversely, if waves of different frequencies are not coherent, then, when combined, they create a wave that is continuous in time (e.g. white light or [[white noise]]). The temporal duration of the pulse &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is limited by the spectral bandwidth of the light &lt;math&gt;\Delta f&lt;/math&gt; according to:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta f\Delta t \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;,

which follows from the properties of the Fourier transform and results in [[Küpfmüller's uncertainty principle]] (for quantum particles it also results in the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]).

If the phase depends linearly on the frequency (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\theta (f) \propto f&lt;/math&gt;) then the pulse will have the minimum time duration for its bandwidth (a ''transform-limited'' pulse), otherwise it is chirped (see [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]]).

===Measurement of spectral coherence===
Measurement of the spectral coherence of light requires a [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear]] optical interferometer, such as an intensity [[optical autocorrelation|optical correlator]], [[frequency-resolved optical gating]] (FROG), or [[spectral phase interferometry for direct electric-field reconstruction]] (SPIDER).
{{clear}}

==Polarization and coherence==
Light also has a [[polarization (waves)|polarization]], which is the direction in which the electric field oscillates. Unpolarized light is composed of incoherent light waves with random polarization angles. The electric field of the unpolarized light wanders in every direction and changes in phase over the coherence time of the two light waves. An absorbing [[polarizer]] rotated to any angle will always transmit half the incident intensity when averaged over time.

If the electric field wanders by a smaller amount the light will be partially polarized so that at some angle, the polarizer will transmit more than half the intensity. If a wave is combined with an orthogonally polarized copy of itself delayed by less than the coherence time, partially polarized light is created.

The polarization of a light beam is represented by a vector in the [[Polarization (waves)#Parameterization|Poincaré sphere]]. For polarized light the end of the vector lies on the surface of the sphere, whereas the vector has zero length for unpolarized light. The vector for partially polarized light lies within the sphere

==Applications==

===Holography===
Coherent superpositions of ''optical wave fields'' include [[holography]]. Holographic objects are used frequently in daily life in bank notes and credit cards.

===Non-optical wave fields===
Further applications concern the coherent superposition of  ''non-optical wave fields''. In quantum mechanics for example one considers a probability field, which is related to the wave function &lt;math&gt;\psi (\mathbf r)&lt;/math&gt; (interpretation: density of the probability amplitude). Here the applications concern, among others, the future technologies of [[quantum computing]] and the already available technology of [[quantum cryptography]]. Additionally the problems of the following subchapter are treated.

===Modal Analysis===
Coherence is used to check the quality of the transfer functions (FRFs) being measured. Low coherence can be caused by poor signal to noise ratio, and/or inadequate frequency resolution.

==Quantum coherence==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[quantum entanglement]] --&gt;
{{further|Quantum decoherence}}
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2015}}
In [[quantum mechanics]], all objects have wave-like properties (see [[Matter wave|de Broglie wave]]s). For instance, in Young's [[double-slit experiment]] electrons can be used in the place of light waves. Each electron's wave-function goes through both slits, and hence has two separate split-beams that contribute to the intensity pattern on a screen. According to standard wave theory

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
these two contributions give rise to an intensity pattern of bright bands due to constructive interference, interlaced with dark bands due to destructive interference, on a downstream screen. This ability to interfere and diffract is related to coherence (classical or quantum) of the waves produced at both slits. The association of an electron with a wave is unique to quantum theory.

When the incident beam is represented by a quantum [[pure state]], the split beams downstream of the two slits are represented as a [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] of the pure states representing each split beam

. The quantum description of imperfectly coherent paths is called a [[Mixed state (physics)|mixed state]]. A perfectly coherent state has a [[density matrix]] (also called the "statistical operator") that is a projection onto the pure coherent state and is equivalent to a wave function, while a mixed state is described by a classical probability distribution for the pure states that make up the mixture. 

[[Macroscopic scale]] quantum coherence leads to novel phenomena, the so-called [[macroscopic quantum phenomena]]. For instance, the [[laser]], [[superconductivity]] and [[superfluidity]] are examples of highly coherent quantum systems whose effects are evident at the macroscopic scale. The macroscopic quantum coherence (Off-Diagonal Long-Range Order, ODLRO)&lt;ref&gt;

for superfluidity, and laser light, is related to first-order (1-body) coherence/ODLRO, while superconductivity is related to second-order coherence/ODLRO. (For fermions, such as electrons, only even orders of coherence/ODLRO are possible.) For bosons, a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] is an example of a system exhibiting macroscopic quantum coherence through a multiple occupied single-particle state. 

The classical electromagnetic field exhibits macroscopic quantum coherence. The most obvious example is the carrier signal for radio and TV. They satisfy [[Roy J. Glauber|Glauber]]'s quantum description of coherence.

Recently [[Martin Bodo Plenio|M.B. Plenio]] and co-workers constructed an operational formulation of quantum coherence as a resource theory. They introduced coherence monotones analogous to the entanglement monotones.&lt;ref&gt;

Some experts, such as Richard Ward, a lecturer and historian of crime and the reporting of crime at the [[University of Exeter]], have stated the view that the Croydon Cat Killer case is an example of a [[moral panic]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Investigation==
In October 2015 South Norwood Animal Rescue and Liberty (SNARL), a small local group of animal welfare activists based in [[South Norwood]], reported incidents of cat mutilation to the police and [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|RSPCA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/patricksmith/the-crazy-story-of-how-british-police-spent-three-years|title=The Crazy Story Of How British Police Spent Three Years Hunting A Serial Cat Killer Who Didn’t Exist|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/Police-evidence-animals-deliberatley-killed-human/story-28807029-detail/story.html|title=Exclusive: Police have more questions than answers in hunt for 'Croydon Cat Killer'|last=Booth|first=Samantha|date=February 25, 2016|work=Croydon Advertiser|accessdate=April 24, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160226093852/http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/Police-evidence-animals-deliberatley-killed-human/story-28807029-detail/story.html|archivedate=February 26, 2016|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That November, the Metropolitan Police began to investigate the mutilations, under the name "Operation Takahe" and led by Detective Sergeant Andy Collin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In January 2016 it was reported that 30,000 local people signed a petition requesting the police conduct [[DNA testing]] of the corpses.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/reward-for-capture-of-croydon-cat-killer-increased-to-5000-a6807771.html|title=Reward for capture of Croydon 'cat killer' increased to £5,000|author=Max Shirley|date=12 January 2016|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By February 2016, the deaths of 10 cats (four in Croydon and one each in [[Streatham]], [[Mitcham Common]], [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], [[Charlton, London|Charlton]], [[Peckham]] and [[Finchley]]) had been linked by an examining vet who wished to remain anonymous.&lt;ref name="BBC19Feb" /&gt; However, the police at this time said the number of cases was in single digits &lt;ref name="BBC19Feb" /&gt; In February 2016 it was reported that police had yet to find any evidence that the animals were deliberately killed by a human.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At this time an investigating vet stated that he found raw chicken in the stomachs of several killed cats and suggested the animals had probably been lured by the killer with the offer of meat.&lt;ref name="BBC19Feb" /&gt; 

In March 2016, Det. Sgt. Collin said that the perpetrator might be only mutilating the corpses after the animals had already died and might only face charges relating to public order or theft. He noted that of the six cases being investigated, five of the cats had not been claimed which would make it difficult to bring charges of theft or criminal damage.&lt;ref name="accident"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/Croydon-Cat-Killer-Cat-mutilations-accidental/story-28836871-detail/story.html|title=Croydon Cat Killer: Cat mutilations after accidental death are not animal cruelty crimes, police say|last=Booth|first=Samantha|date=March 1, 2016|work=Croydon Advertiser|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2016, no human DNA had been recovered.&lt;ref name="accident" /&gt;   

In April 2016 it was reported that the RSPCA believed that the deaths were due to [[blunt trauma]], “likely consistent with being hit by a moving vehicle”&lt;ref name="mystery" /&gt;. SNARL claimed that the animals were killed deliberately, perhaps by being thrown against a wall.&lt;ref name="mystery" /&gt; By April 2016, SNARL had recorded 50 attacks across [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]], [[Mitcham]], [[Streatham]], [[Peckham]], [[Charlton, London|Charlton]], [[Richmond, London|Richmond]], [[Orpington]], and [[Farnborough, London|Farnborough]] in south London, [[Finchley]], [[Tottenham]] and [[Archway, London|Archway]] in north London, [[Stepney]] in the east, and [[Guildford]] in Surrey.&lt;ref name="mystery" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC19Feb" /&gt; SNARL reported that other animals including foxes and rabbits have been attacked in the same way.&lt;ref name="mystery" /&gt; 

In June 2016, SNARL speculated that there had been 100 kills following a decapitated cat being found in [[Morden]].&lt;ref name="morden"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/campaigners-fear-croydon-cat-killer-8103988|title=Has the 'Croydon Cat Killer' claimed 100th victim?|last=Dyer|first=Chris|date=2016-06-02|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time police stated that they had spent 1,020 hours on the inquiry since December 2015.&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/09/09/croydon-cat-killer-linked-to-seven-animal-murders-this-week-alone-6914734/|title=Croydon cat killer linked to seven animal murders this week alone|date=9 September 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By July 2016, the media and SNARL had begun referring to the attacker as the "M25 Cat Killer" after new reports, including a cat killed in [[Whyteleafe]], Surrey, suggested the killer was operating around the [[M25 motorway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/croydon-cat-killer-widened-brutal-8414154|title=Croydon Cat Killer has widened brutal spree around the M25, say police|last=Alexander|first=Stian|date=2016-07-13|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reports of animal deaths in [[Maidstone]], [[Sevenoaks]] and seven other locations, SNARL adopted the terms "M25 Animal Killer" and "UK Cat Killer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/sevenoaks/news/croydon-cat-killer-otford-sevenoaks-m25-animal-100914/ | title=Has 'Croydon Cat Killer' killed pet in Otford, near Sevenoaks? | work=Kent Online | date=17 August 2016 | accessdate=19 August 2016 | author=Elvey, Suz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/london/2016-08-17/new-attack-linked-to-croydon-cat-killer/|title=New attack linked to 'Croydon Cat Killer'|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Det. Sgt. Collin, speaking in 2017 about a possible motive stated “Cats are targeted because they are associated with the feminine... The killer can't deal with a woman or women who are troubling him”. He added that he was worried that “at some stage he'll escalate or feel brave enough to move on to vulnerable women and girls.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Vince Egan, associate professor of [[forensic psychology]] at the [[University of Nottingham]] has said: “In some individuals we have seen animal cruelty as part of a broader pattern in which humans are also harmed. It is far more likely that this reflects a rather more banal pattern of anti-social behaviour, such as drunkenness or something that doesn’t go further. But when we have so little to go on you have to keep your mind open.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/fears-grow-as-croydon-cat-killer-casts-net-more-widely-a6898961.html|title=Fears are growing as the Croydon cat killer casts a wider net|date=26 February 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, [[ArroGen Veterinary Forensics]] began re-examining some animals to help the police and RSPCA to bring prosecutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/29/croydon-cat-killer-forensic-science-lab-to-re-examine-animal-deaths|title=‘Croydon cat killer’: forensic science lab to re-examine deaths|last=Grierson|first=Jamie|date=2017-09-29|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-01|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017 it was reported that the killer was suspected of mutilating over 370 animals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Det. Sgt. Collin stated that it was possible there were [[Copycat crime|copycats]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/croydon-cat-killer-british-pets-mutilated-two-year-murder-spree-still-at-large-a8027461.html|title='Croydon cat killer' suspected of mutilating 370 pets over two years|date=2017-10-30|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, police linked five cat deaths around [[Northampton]] from August to November that year to the same killer, but later police stated the Northampton deaths were not being linked to the others though a 31-year-old man had been arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-42608115|title=Cat deaths not linked to Croydon killer|date=15 June 2018|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2018|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was reported in August 2018 that, three years after the first report of the Croydon Cat Killer, no evidence relating to an individual who may be committing the alleged crimes had been found. There was no evidence found of clothing, human DNA or a murder weapon and no CCTV footage had been recovered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In September 2018, the Metropolitan Police reported that in three instances where CCTV footage was obtained, foxes could be seen carrying bodies or body-parts of cats. In one case, CCTV showed a fox carrying a cat's head into a school playground at Catford. In post-mortem examinations conducted by the Head of Veterinary Forensic Pathology at the [[Royal Veterinary College]], fox DNA was found on the cats bodies.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt;  The Met closed the investigation on September 20th, saying foxes mutilating the bodies of cats that died in road traffic accidents was the most likely explanation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/croydon-cat-killer-unmasked-police-reveal-culprits-after-three-year-investigation-and-500-deaths-a3940956.html Croydon cat killer unmasked: Met Police reveal culprits after three year probe and 500 deaths... are foxes], Evening Standard, September 20, 2018.

==Reactions==
In February 2016, the animal rights charity [[PETA]] offered a £5,000 reward (raised from an initial £2,000 in December 2015) to anyone providing information to the police that leads to the arrest and conviction of the serial cat killer (or killers).&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="peta"&gt;{{cite web|title=PETA Offers £5,000 Reward to Help Catch ‘Cat Ripper of Croydon’|url=http://www.peta.org.uk/blog/peta-offers-5000-reward-to-help-catch-cat-ripper-of-croydon/|publisher=PETA UK|accessdate=15 February 2016|author=|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public figures local to Croydon such as [[Martin Clunes]], [[Dermot O'Leary]] and [[Caroline Flack]] used their social media accounts to raise awareness of the crime in the hope it would lead to an arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Croydon Cat Killer: Celebrities join the fight to catch the culprit|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/croydon-cat-killer-celebrities-join-the-fight-to-catch-the-culprit-a3163901.html|publisher=The Standard|accessdate=15 February 2016|author=Hannah Al-Othman|date=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an email to [[Metropolitan Police Commissioner]], Sir [[Bernard Hogan-Howe]], actor Clunes wrote, "As someone who shares my home with several four-legged companions I read with horror that some of the cats had been decapitated, disemboweled or dismembered – this is the stuff of nightmares."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The hunt for the Croydon serial cat killer|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/643394/Hunt-Croydon-serial-cat-killer|publisher=The Daily Express|accessdate=15 February 2016|author=Virginia Blackburn|date=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, [[Vice Media]] released a half-hour documentary about the purported cat killer and SNARL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/7bdywb/croydon-cat-killer-snarl|title=Meet the Pet Detectives Hunting for the Croydon Cat Killer|date=2016-03-14|work=Vice|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en-uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cases were featured in [[The Met: Policing London]] - Series 2, Episode 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Met: Policing London - Series 2, Episode 4|date=2017-06-14|work=BBC One|access-date=2018-09-21|language=en-uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, about 20,000 people were outraged from Metropolitan Police's announcement to close the case of Croydon Cat Killer. Vinnii West, who started the petition says the Metropolitan Police admitted the deaths of cats were attributed to cars and foxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/nearly-20000-sign-petition-urging-met-to-reopen-croydon-cat-killer-case-a3944206.html|title=Nearly 20,000 sign petition urging Met to reopen Croydon cat killer case|work=Evening Standard|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scepticism ==
In July 2018, Stephen Harris, retired professor of environmental sciences at the [[University of Bristol]], who had studied fox behaviour for 50 years&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/08/croydon-cat-killer-hunt-three-years-man-myth|title=The ‘Croydon cat killer’ hunt has lasted three grisly years. But is he man or myth?|last=Usborne|first=Simon|date=2018-08-08|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote an article in ''[[New Scientist]].'' He asserted that there is no "killer" and the pattern of blunt-force trauma followed by removal of the head and tail once the blood has congealed is consistent with [[Roadkill|road traffic accidents]] then scavenging by foxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2173998-prolific-m25-serial-killer-beheading-cats-is-an-old-feline-foe/|title=Prolific ‘M25 serial killer’ beheading cats is an old feline foe|date=July 11, 2018|work=New Scientist|last=Harris|first=Stephen}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s there was a similar panic following the discovery of dozens of cat deaths in Greater London. The [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|RSPCA]] sought Harris’s advice at this time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Those events led to the Metropolitan police opening Operation Obelisk in 1998. However, they quietly dropped the case in 1999 after Harris inspected several cats. He concluded that they had been killed by cars and mutilated by foxes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Harris stated “We have known for decades that foxes chew the head or tail off carcasses, including dead cats”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Parallels have been drawn between the Croydon Cat Killer and [[moral panic]]s, in which public fear and lurid headlines amplify perceptions of danger which puts pressure on authorities to act.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Richard Ward, lecturer and historian of crime and the reporting of crime at the [[University of Exeter]] has stated that the creation of Operation Takahe appears to be the result of such a moral panic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3507">The '''Destruction in Art Symposium''' (DIAS) was a gathering of a diverse group of international artists, poets, and scientists to [[London]], from 9–11 September 1966. Included in this number were representatives of the [[Counter-culture|counter-cultural]] underground who were there to speak on the theme of destruction in art.

The Honorary Committee, led by [[Gustav Metzger]], attracted the attention of both the international media and international art community to the symposium.&lt;ref name="TateDIAS"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/art-60s-was-tomorrow/exhibition-themes/destruction-art-symposium Destruction in Art Symposium], Art &amp; The 60s: This was Tomorrow, Tate Britain, retrieved 2006-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event==
The symposium was held at the [[Africa Centre]] in [[Covent Garden]], London.

==Objectives==
A DIAS press release claimed: 
{{cquote|The main objective of DIAS was to focus attention on the element of destruction in Happenings and other art forms, and to relate this destruction in society.|author=DIAS&lt;ref name="TateDIAS" /&gt;}}

==Happenings==

[[Image:Anaerobic digestate.JPG|right|thumbnail|300px|Acidogenic digestate produced from mixed [[municipal waste]] ]]
'''Digestate''' is the material remaining after the anaerobic digestion of a [[biodegradable]] feedstock. [[Anaerobic digestion]] produces two main products: digestate and [[biogas]]. Digestate is produced both by [[acidogenesis]] and [[methanogenesis]] and each has different characteristics.

== Acidogenic digestate ==

Acidogenic digestate is fibrous and consists of structural plant matter including [[lignin]] and [[cellulose]]. Acidogenic digestate has high moisture retention properties. The digestate may also contain [[minerals]] and remnants of [[bacteria]].

== Methanogenic digestate ==

Methanogenic digestate is a sludge (sometimes called a liquor). This is often high in nutrients such as [[ammonium]]s and [[phosphate]]s.

==Uses==

The primary use of digestate is as a [[soil conditioner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-opportunities-for-converting-indigenous-uk-wastes-to-fuels-and-energy-report-nnfcc-09-012 Evaluation of Opportunities for Converting Indigenous UK Wastes to Fuels and Energy (Report), NNFCC 09-012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720181907/http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-opportunities-for-converting-indigenous-uk-wastes-to-fuels-and-energy-report-nnfcc-09-012 |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acidogenic digestate provides [[moisture retention]] and organic content for soils. This organic material can break down further, aerobically in [[soil]]. Methanogenic digestate provides nutrients for [[plant]] growth. It can also be used to protect soils against erosion.

Acidogenic digestate can also be used as an [[environmentally friendly]] filler to give structure to [[Plastic compounding|composite plastics]].

Growth trials on digestate originating from mixed waste have showed healthy growth results for crops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexmarshall.me.uk/index_files/documents/ResponsetoConsultationonthesourcesegregationrequirementinParagraph7AofSchedule3totheWasteMan.pdf Response to source segregation requirement], www.alexmarshall.me.uk, Retrieved 22.02.07&lt;/ref&gt; Digestate can also be used in intensive greenhouse cultivation of plants, e.g. in [[Digeponics]].

Application of digestate has been shown to inhibit plant diseases and induction of resistance. Digestate application has a direct effect on soil-born diseases, and an indirect effect by stimulation of biological activity.

==Digestate and compost==
Digestate is technically not [[compost]] although it is similar to it in physical and chemical characteristics. Compost is produced by [[aerobic digestion]]- [[Aerobic decomposition|decomposition by aerobes]]. This includes [[fungi]] and [[bacteria]] which are able to break down the lignin and cellulose to a greater extent.

==Standards for digestate==
The standard of digestate produced by anaerobic digestion can be assessed on three criteria, chemical, biological and physical aspects. Chemical quality needs to be considered in terms of heavy metals and other inorganic contaminant, persistent organic compounds and the content of macro-elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Depending on their source, biowastes can contain pathogens, which can lead to the spreading of human, animal or plant diseases if not appropriately managed. 

The physical standards of composts includes mainly appearance and odour factors. Whilst physical contamination does not present a problem with regards to human, plant or animal health, contamination (in the form of plastics, metals and ceramics) can cause a negative public perception. Even if the compost is of high quality and all standards are met, a negative public perception of waste-based composts still exists. The presence of visible contaminants reminds users of this.

Quality control of the feedstock is the most important way of ensuring a quality end product. The content and quality of waste arriving on-site should be characterised as thoroughly as possible prior to being supplied.

In the UK the [[Publicly Available Specification]] (called PAS110) governs the definition of digestate derived from the anaerobic digestion of source-segregated biodegradable materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrap.org.uk/ad WRAP Anaerobic Digestion Page]&lt;/ref&gt; The specification ensures all digested materials are of consistent quality and fit for purpose. If a biogas plant meets the standard, its digestate will be regarded as having been fully recovered and to have ceased to be waste, and it can be sold with the name “Bio- fertiliser”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biogas-info.co.uk/index.php/standards-agri.html UK's Official Information Portal on Anaerobic Digestion and Biogas, Digestate Standards Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Embarrassment''' or '''awkwardness''' is an [[emotion]]al state that is associated with mild to severe levels of discomfort, and which is usually experienced when someone has a socially unacceptable or frowned-upon act or condition that was witnessed by or revealed to others.

Usually some perception of loss of [[honor]] or [[dignity]] (or other high-value ideals) is involved, but the embarrassment level and the type depends on the situation. Embarrassment is similar to [[shame]] in some sense, except that shame may be experienced for an act known only to oneself.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Also, embarrassment usually carries the connotation of being caused by an act that is merely socially unacceptable, rather than [[morality|morally]] wrong.

== Causes ==
Embarrassment can be personal, caused by unwanted attention to private matters or personal flaws or mishaps.  Some causes of embarrassment stem from personal actions, such as being caught in a lie or in making a mistake. In many cultures, being seen [[nude]] or in [[underwear]] is a particularly stressful form of embarrassment (see [[Body modesty|modesty]]). Personal embarrassment can also stem from the actions of others who place the embarrassed person in a socially awkward situation—such as a parent showing one's baby pictures to friends, having someone make a derogatory comment about one's appearance or behaviour, discovering one is the victim of [[gossip]], being rejected by another person (see also [[humiliation]]), being made the focus of attention (e.g., [[birthday]] celebrants, newlyweds), or even witnessing someone else's embarrassment.

Personal embarrassment is usually accompanied by some combination of [[blushing]], [[sweating]], [[Anxiety|nervousness]], [[stammer]]ing, and [[fidgeting]].  Sometimes the embarrassed person tries to mask embarrassment with smiles or [[nervous laughter]], especially in etiquette situations. Such a response is more common in certain cultures, which may lead to misunderstanding. There may also be feelings of [[anger]] depending on the perceived seriousness of the situation, especially if the individual thinks another person is intentionally causing the embarrassment. There is a range of responses, with the most minor being a perception of the embarrassing act as inconsequential or even [[humor]]ous, to intense apprehension or fear.

The idea that embarrassment serves an apology or appeasement function originated with Goffman (1967) who argued the embarrassed individual "demonstrates that he/she is at least disturbed by the fact and may prove worthy at another time". Semin &amp; Manstead (1982) demonstrated social functions of embarrassment whereby the perpetrator of knocking over a sales display (the "bad act") was deemed more likable by others if he/she appeared embarrassed than if he/she appeared unconcerned – regardless of restitution behaviour (rebuilding the display). The capacity to experience embarrassment can also be seen as functional for the group or culture. It has been demonstrated that those who are not prone to embarrassment are more likely to engage in antisocial behaviour – for example, adolescent boys who displayed more embarrassment were found less likely to engage in aggressive/delinquent behaviours. Similarly, embarrassment exhibited by boys more likely to engage in aggressive/delinquent behaviour was less than one-third of that exhibited by non-aggressive boys (Ketlner et al. 1995). Thus proneness to embarrassment (i.e., a concern for how one is evaluated by others) can act as a brake on behaviour that would be dysfunctional for a group or culture.

===Professional embarrassment===
Embarrassment can also be '''professional''' or '''official''', especially after statements expressing confidence in a stated course of action, or willful disregard for evidence.  Embarrassment increases greatly in instances involving official duties or workplace facilities, large amounts of money or materials, or loss of human life.  Examples of causes include a government's failed public policy, exposure of corrupt practices or unethical behaviour, a celebrity whose personal habits receive public scrutiny or face legal action, or officials caught in serious personally embarrassing situations. Even small errors or miscalculations can lead to significantly greater official embarrassment if it is discovered that there was willful disregard for evidence or directives involved (e.g., see [[Space Shuttle Challenger]]).

Not all official failures result in official embarrassment, even if the circumstances lead to some slight personal embarrassment for the people involved.  For example, losing a close political election might cause some personal embarrassment for the candidate but generally would be considered an honorable loss in the profession and thus not necessarily lead to professional embarrassment. Similarly, a scientist might be personally disappointed and embarrassed if one of his hypotheses was proven wrong, but would not normally suffer professional embarrassment as a result.  By contrast, exposure of falsified data supporting a scientific claim (e.g., see [[Hwang Woo-Suk]]) would likely lead to professional embarrassment in the scientific community. Professional or official embarrassment is often accompanied by public expressions of [[anger]], [[denial]] of involvement, or attempts to [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimize]] the consequences.  Sometimes the embarrassed entity issues press statements, removes or distance themselves from sub-level employees, attempts to carry on as if nothing happened, suffers income loss, emigrates, or vanishes from public view.

===Vicarious embarrassment===

{{Main|Vicarious embarrassment}}
Vicarious embarrassment is an embarrassed feeling from observing the embarrassing actions of another person.&lt;ref name=validation&gt;Ahmet Uysal, Gülçin Akbas, Elif Helvacı, and Irem Metin, [https://www.academia.edu/6563886/Validation_and_correlates_of_the_vicarious_embarrassment_scale Validation and correlates of the vicarious embarrassment scale], ''Personality and Individual Differences'' 60 (2014), pp. 48–53&lt;/ref&gt; People who rate themselves as more empathic are more likely to experience vicarious embarrassment.&lt;ref name=eurekalert&gt;EurekAlert!, [https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-04/plos-yfa041211.php Your flaws are my pain], 13 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is present whether or not the observed party is aware of the embarrassing nature of their actions, although awareness generally increases the strength of the felt vicarious embarrassment, as does an accidental (as opposed to intentional) action.&lt;ref name=flaws&gt;Sören Krach, Jan Christopher Cohrs, Nicole Cruz de Echeverría Loebell, Tilo Kircher, Jens Sommer, Andreas Jansen, and Frieder Michel Paulus, [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018675 Your Flaws Are My Pain: Linking Empathy To Vicarious Embarrassment], PLoS ONE, 13 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types in social psychology===
[[File:Antoine Watteau 014.jpg|thumb|''An embarrassing proposal'' by [[Antoine Watteau]]]]
One typology of embarrassment is described by Sharkey and Stafford. There are six types of embarrassment:&lt;ref name="Withers &amp; Sherblom (1986)."&gt;{{cite journal|last = Withers|first = Lesley|last2=Sherblom|first2=John|title = Embarrassment: The Communication of an Awkward Actor Anticipating a Negative Evaluation|journal = Human Communication|volume = 11| issue = 2| pages = 237–254|year =}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
#[[Privacy]] violations – for example where [[Wardrobe malfunction|a part of the body is accidentally exposed]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Example of Embarrassing Wardrobe malfunction in college hostel|url=https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-embarrassing-things-girls-usually-do/answers/54002496|website=Quora}}&lt;/ref&gt; or there is an invasion of space, property, or information that may be warranted to privacy,
# Lack of [[knowledge]] and [[skill]] – for example forgetfulness, or experiencing failure while performing a relatively easy task
# [[Criticism]] and rejection – is another cause of embarrassment, as well as being made the center of attention positively or negatively
# Awkward acts – refer to social situations, for example inappropriate conversations, clumsiness or ungraceful actions (such as an emotional outbreak like speaking out unintentionally) that can trigger embarrassment
# Appropriate image – refers to more of a personal reflection of embarrassment, like body image, clothing apparel, and personal possessions for example owning a regular phone in compared to the latest phone
# [[Social environment|Environment]] – can also have the effect of provoking embarrassment, as when an individual in a movie theatre with his or her parents, other family, co-workers, or mixed-company peers is made uncomfortable by an unexpected occurrence of nudity in the film that the group is watching.

Another typology, by Cupach and Metts, discusses the dimensions of intended-unintended and appropriate-inappropriate behavior, and four basic types of embarrassing circumstances: 
# Faux pas (socially awkward acts)
# [[Accidents]]
# Mistakes
# Failure to perform a duty or moral obligation.

Based on these types, Cupach and Metts classify two basic embarrassment situations: the actor responsible and the observer responsible. Actor responsible situations are embarrassing when a person executes an act that is either inappropriate to a point of proficiency matching social norms and expectations, inconsistent with role expectations, or is out-of-sync with a [[social identity]]. The observer responsible categories are embarrassing when an individual becomes the focus of attention through:
* Recognition, praise, criticism, correction, or teasing
* Becomes initialized through being tripped or bumped, which is then associated with someone acting inappropriately
* Has information revealed publicly to another individual or peer group

==Etymology==
The first known written occurrence of ''embarrass'' in English was in 1664 by [[Samuel Pepys]] in his diary. The word derives from the French word ''embarrasser'', "to block" or "obstruct",&lt;sup&gt;[[#endnotes|1]]&lt;/sup&gt; whose first recorded usage was by [[Michel de Montaigne]] in 1580. The French word was derived from the Spanish ''[[embarazar]]'', whose first recorded usage was in 1460 in ''Cancionero de Stúñiga'' (Songbook of Stúñiga) by [[Álvaro de Luna]].&lt;sup&gt;[[#endnotes|2]]&lt;/sup&gt; The Spanish word comes from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''embaraçar'', which is a combination of the [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] ''em-'' (from Latin ''im-'' for "in-") with ''baraço'' or ''baraça'', "a noose" or "rope".&lt;sup&gt;[[#endnotes|3]]&lt;/sup&gt; ''Baraça'' originated before the Romans began their conquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in 218 BC.&lt;sup&gt;[[#endnotes|4]]&lt;/sup&gt; Thus, ''baraça'' could be related to the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] word ''barr'', "tuft". (Celtic people actually settled much of Spain and Portugal beginning in the 8th century BC)&lt;sup&gt;[[#endnotes|5]]&lt;/sup&gt; However, it certainly is not directly derived from it, as the substitution of ''r'' for ''rr'' in [[Iberian Romance languages|Ibero-Romantic]] languages was not a known occurrence.

The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word may come from the Italian ''imbarazzare'', from ''imbarazzo'', "obstacle" or "obstruction". That word came from ''imbarrare'', "to block" or "bar", which is a combination of ''in-'', "in" with ''barra'', "bar" (from the [[Vulgar Latin]] ''barra'', which is of unknown origin).&lt;sup&gt;[[#endnotes|6]]&lt;/sup&gt; The problem with this theory is that the first known usage of the word in Italian was by [[Bernardo Davanzati]] (1529–1606), long after the word had entered Spanish.&lt;sup&gt;[[#endnotes|7]]&lt;/sup&gt;

[[File:Foot whipping.JPG|thumb|262px|Bastinado demonstration using a cane]]
'''Foot whipping''' or '''bastinado''' is a method of [[corporal punishment]] which consists of hitting the soles of a person's bare [[feet]]. Unlike most types of flogging, this punishment was meant to be more painful than it was to cause actual injury to the victim. Blows were generally delivered with a light rod, knotted cord, or lash.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/flogging#ref177595&lt;/ref&gt;

The receiving person is required to be [[barefoot]]. The uncovered [[sole (foot)|soles]] of the feet need to be placed in an exposed position. The beating is typically performed with an object in the type of a [[caning|cane]] or [[Switch (corporal punishment)|switch]]. The strokes are usually aimed at the [[arches of the foot|arches of the feet]] and repeated a certain number of times.

Bastinado is also referred to as ''foot (bottom) caning'' or ''sole caning'', depending on the instrument in use. The particular Middle East method is called ''falaka'' or ''falanga'',&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. [[Wolfgang Schweickard]], [http://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/schweickard/turkisms-in-italian-french-and-german/articles.html ''Turkisms in Italian, French and German (Ottoman Period, 1300-1900). A historical and etymological dictionary'' s.v. ''falaka'']&lt;/ref&gt; derived from the Greek term ''[[phalanx]]''. The German term is ''Bastonade'', deriving from the Italian noun ''bastonata'' (''stroke with the use of a stick''). In former times it was also referred to as ''Sohlenstreich'' (corr. ''striking the soles''). The Chinese term is ''da jiao xin''.

==Overview==
The first scripted documentation of bastinado in Europe dates back to the year 1537, in China to 960.{{sfn|Rejali|2009|p=274}} References to bastinado have been hypothesised to be found in the [[Bible]] (Prov. 22:15; Lev. 19:20; Deut. 22:18), suggesting the practice since antiquity.&lt;ref name="www.biblegateway.com"&gt;{{cite web| title=BASTINADO| url=http://www.biblegateway.com/resources/dictionaries/dict_meaning.php?source=1&amp;wid=T0000469| publisher=www.biblegateway.com| accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This subform of [[flagellation]] differentiates from most other forms by limiting the strokes to a very narrow section of the body. The beatings typically aim at the vaults of the feet where the soles are particularly pain sensitive, at this usually avoiding hitting the balls and heels directly but concentrating on the small area in between.

As the skin texture under the soles of the feet can naturally endure high levels of strain, injuries demanding medical attention, such as lacerations or bruises, are rarely inflicted if certain precautions are observed by the executant. The undersides of the feet have therefore become a common target for corporal punishment in many cultures while basically different methods exist.

Foot whipping is typically carried out within [[prison]]s and similar institutions. Besides inflicting intense physical suffering it trades on the significance of bare feet as a dishonouring socio-cultural attribute. Therefore, it is regarded to be a particularly humiliating as well as degrading form of punishment.

As wearing shoes is an integral element of societal appearance since antiquity, the visual exposure of bare feet is a traditional and sometimes even [[Barefoot#Religious aspects|ritualistic practice]] to display the subjection or submission of a person under a manifestation of superior power. At this was often used as a visual indicator of a subservient standing within a social structure and to display the imbalance in power. It was therefore routinely imposed as a visual identifier and obstacle on [[Barefoot#Imprisonment and slavery|slaves]] and [[prisoner]]s, often divested of rights and liberties in a similar manner. Exploiting its socio-cultural significance, people have been forced to go barefoot as a formal [[Badge of shame#Bare feet|shame sanction]] and for [[Public humiliation#Shameful exposure|public humiliation]] as well. Keeping prisoners barefoot is common practice [[Barefoot#Imprisonment|in several countries]] of today.

Foot whipping therefore poses a distinct threat and is often particularly dreaded by potential victims (usually prisoners). Exploiting the effects this penalty is typically used to maintain discipline and compliance in prisons.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Eysenck, Meili: Lexikon der Psychologie (Encyclopedia of Psychology), Band 3, 1973, S. 476f, {{ISBN|3-451-16113-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bastinado is commonly associated with Middle and Far Eastern nations, where it is occasionally executed in public, therefore covered by occasional reports and photographs. However it has been frequently practised within in the Western World as well, particularly in [[prison]]s, [[reformatory|reformatories]], [[boarding school]]s and similar institutions.

In Europe bastinado was a frequently encountered form of corporal punishment particularly in German areas, where it was mainly carried out to enforce [[Discipline#Prison discipline|discipline]] within penal and reformatory institutions, culminating during the [[Nazi-Germany|Third Reich]] era. In several German and Austrian institutions it was still practised during the 1950s.&lt;ref name="kurier.at"&gt;{{cite web| title=Wimmersdorf: 270 Schläge auf die Fußsohlen| url=http://kurier.at/chronik/niederoesterreich/wimmersdorf-270-schlaege-auf-die-fusssohlen/30.980.261| language=de| publisher=kurier.at| accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="krone.at"&gt;"krone.at" vom 29. März 2012 [http://www.krone.at/Oesterreich/Berichte_ueber_Folter_in_Kinder-Heim_auf_der_Hohen_Warte-Schwere_Vorwuerfe-Story-316489 Berichte über Folter im Kinderheim auf der Hohen Warte]; 3 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rejali|2009|p=275}}&lt;ref name="Cesereanu"&gt;Ruxandra Cesereanu: ''An Overview of Political Torture in the Twentieth Century''. p. 124f.&lt;/ref&gt; Although bastinado was practiced in penal institutions of the Western world until the late 20th century, it was barely noticed as there is no reference to ever being adjudged on a high level. Instead it was carried out on a rather low level within the confines of the institutions, typically to punish inmates during incarceration. If not specifically authorized the practice was usually condoned, while happening unbeknown to the public. Also foot whipping hardly attracts public interest in general as it appears unspectacular and relatively inoffensive compared to other punishment methods. As it was not executed publicly in the western world, it came to be witnessed only by the individuals directly involved. At this former prisoners rarely communicate incidents as bastinado is widely perceived as a degrading punishment (see [[Public humiliation#Shameful exposure|public humiliation]]), while former executants are usually obliged to confidentiality.

Bastinado is still used as prison punishment in several countries (see below). As it causes a high level of suffering for the victim and [[physical evidence]] remains largely undetectable after some time, it is frequently used for [[interrogation]] and [[torture]].

== Appearance ==
Bastinado usually requires a certain amount of collaborative effort and an authoritarian presence on the executing party to be enforced. Therefore, it typically appears in settings where corporal punishment is officially approved to be exerted on predefined group of people. This can be situations of imprisonment and incarceration as well as [[slavery]]. This moderated subform of [[flagellation]] is characteristically prevalent where subjected individuals are forced to remain barefoot.

=== Regional ===
Foot whipping was common practice as means of disciplinary punishment in different kinds of institutions throughout Central Europe until the 1950s, especially in German territories.&lt;ref name="kurier.at" /&gt;&lt;ref name="krone.at" /&gt; &lt;br&gt;
In German prisons this method consistently served as the principal disciplinary punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hawkins |first=Francis Bisset |title=Germany: The Spirit of Her History, Literature, Social Condition and National Economy : Illustrated by Reference to Her Physical, Moral, and Political Statistics, and by Comparison with Other Countries |publisher=Charles Jugel at the German and foreign library |date=1839 |page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] era it was frequently used in German penal institutions and labour camps.&lt;br&gt;It was also inflicted on the population in occupied territories, notably Denmark and Norway.{{sfn|Rejali|2009|p=275}}

During the era of slavery in Brazil and the American South it was often used whenever so-called "clean beating" instead of the prevalent more radical forms of [[flagellation]] was demanded. This was the case when a loss in market value through visible injuries especially on females was to be avoided. As many so-called "slave-codes" included a barefoot constraint, bastinado required minimal effort to be performed.&lt;ref name="WCG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cape Town and Surrounds.|url=https://www.westerncape.gov.za/general-publication/places-slave-rememberance-western-cape?toc_page=3|publisher=Western Cape Government| accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it was sufficiently effective but usually left no visible or relevant injuries, bastinado was often used as an alternative for female slaves with higher market value.{{sfn|Rejali|2009|p=277}}

Bastinado is still practised in penal institutions of several countries around the world. In a 1967 survey 83% of the inmates in Greek prisons reported about frequent infliction of bastinado. It was also used against rioting students. In Spanish prisons 39% of the inmates reported about this kind of treatment. The French [[Sûreté]] reportedly used it to extract confessions. British occupants used it in Palestine, French occupants in Algeria. Within colonial India it was used to punish tax offenders. Within penal institutions in Europe bastinado was reportedly used in Germany, Austria, France, Spain, Greece, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Portugal, Macedonia, Lithuania, Georgia, Ukraine, Cyprus, Slovakia and Croatia. Other nations with documented use of bastinado are Syria, Israel, Turkey, Morocco, Iran, Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Lebanon, Tunisia, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Brazil, Argentina, Nicaragua, Chile, South Africa, Venezuela, Rhodesia, Zimbabwe, Paraguay, Honduras, Bolivia, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Cameroon, Mauritius, Philippines, South Korea, Pakistan and Nepal.{{sfn|Rejali|2009|p=275}}

*This punishment has, at various times, been used in [[China]], as well as the [[Middle East]]. "No crimes pass unpunished in China. The bastinado is the common punishment for slight faults, and the number of blows is proportionable to the nature of the fault... When the number of blows does not exceed twenty, it is accounted a fatherly correction.

== Methods ==
[[File:Antoin Sevruguin 12 Falak Whipping the soles of a criminal.jpg|thumb|left|Middle Eastern falaka using a plank; [[Iran]], early 20th century]]
[[File:Third Reich bastonade table.jpg|thumb|Depiction of punishment bench as used for bastinado in several German prisons during the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] era]] 
The prisoner is barefooted and restrained in such manner, that the feet cannot be shifted out of position. The intention is to avert serious injuries of the forefoot by stray hitting, especially of the fracturable [[toe]]s. The energy of the stroke impacts is typically meant to be absorbed by the muscular tissue inside the vaults of the feet.

The Middle Eastern ''falaka'' method entails tying up the person's feet into an elevated position while lying on the back, the beating is generally performed with a rigid wooden stick, a club or a truncheon. The term ''falaka'' describes the wooden plank used to tie up the ankles, however different items are used for this purpose. The essentially different German method, which was practiced until the end of the [[Nazism|Third Reich]] era, consisted in strapping the barefoot prisoner prone onto a wooden bench or a plank. Hereby the feet were forced into a pointed posture ([[Plantarflexion#Flexion and extension of the foot|plantar flexion]]) with their bare undersides facing upward. For this purpose the upper body and both ankles were strapped onto the bench. The prisoner's hands were tied behind the back, usually using a cord or a leather strap. Hereby the person was rendered largely immobile and was especially not able to move the feet out of their forced position. The typically occurring contortions of the body during the execution were largely halted as well. This way the punishment could be inflicted with a certain degree of accuracy to not cause unwanted lesions or other severe injury. It was typically executed with a slightly flexible beating accessory such as a [[caning|cane]] or a [[switch (corporal punishment)|switch]]. More infrequently also short [[whip]]s or leather straps were used. This form of punishment was mainly employed in women's penal institutions and [[labor camp]]s where prisoners were often kept barefoot.&lt;ref name="Cesereanu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AI Newsletter 09-1987 [http://ob.nubati.net/wiki/Illustrated_Reports_of_Amnesty_International Illustrated Reports of Amnesty International] 20 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The middle eastern ''falaka'' is more inclined to cause serious injuries such as bone fractures and nerve damage than the German method, as the person undergoing falaka can move the body and feet to a certain degree. As a result, the strokes impact more or less randomly and injury-prone areas are frequently affected. As falaka is usually carried out with a rigid and often heavy stick, it accordingly causes [[blunt trauma]] leaving the person unable to walk and often impeded for life. For the German form, the prisoner was principally unable to move and the beatings were performed with lightweight objects that were relatively thin in diameter and usually slightly flexible. The physical aftereffects of the procedure remained mostly superficial and unwanted injuries were relatively rare. Therefore, the person usually remained capable of walking right after the punishment. Still, the German form of bastinado caused severe levels of pain and suffering for the receiving person.

== Effects ==
The beatings usually aim at the tender [[longitudinal arch of the foot]] avoiding the bone structure of the ball and the heel. The vaults are particularly touch-sensitive and therefore susceptible to pain due to the tight clustering of [[nerve|nerve ending]]s.

=== Corporal ===
[[File:Bastinado visible aftereffects.JPG|thumb|160px|Visible welts typically sustained after bastinado]]
When exerted with a thin and flexible object of lighter weight the corporal effects usually remain temporary. The numerous [[bone]]s and [[tendon]]s of the foot are sufficiently protected by [[muscular tissue]] so the impact is absorbed by the skin and muscular tissue. The skin under the soles of the human feet is of high elasticity and consistence similar to the palms of the hands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medizinfo.de/hautundhaar/anatomie/lederhaut.htm Lederhaut] in „MedizInfo“ about the dermis; 20 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Lesions and [[hematoma]] therefore rarely occur while beating marks are mostly superficial. Depending on the characteristics of the beating device in use and the intensity of the beatings the emerging visible aftereffects remain ascertainable over a time frame of a few hours to several days. The receiving person usually remains able to walk without help right after the punishment.

When the beating is executed with heavy sticks like clubs or truncheons according to the falaka method, bone fractures commonly occur as well as nerve damage and severe hematoma. The sustained injuries can take a long time to heal with even lasting or irreversible physical damage to the [[human musculoskeletal system]].

When thin and flexible instruments are used the immediate experience of pain is described as acutely stinging and searing. The instant sensations are disproportionally intense compared to the applied force and reflexively radiate through the body. The subsequent pain sensations of a succession of strokes are often described as throbbing, piercing or burning and gradually ease off within a few hours. A slightly stinging or nagging sensation often remains perceptible for a couple of days, especially while walking.

As the nerve endings under the soles of the feet do not adapt to recurring sensations or impacts, the pain reception does not alleviate through continuous beatings. On the contrary the perception of pain is further intensified over the course of additional impacts through the activation of [[nociceptor]]s. Over a sequence of impacts applied with nearly constant force the perception of pain is therefore progressively intensifying until a maximum level of activation is reached. For that reason a facile impact can already cause an acute pain sensation after a certain number of preceding strokes.

The subjective experience of corporal suffering can however largely diverge according to a person's individual [[pain tolerance]]. The pain reception itself is hereby aggravated through feelings of anxiety and agitation. The subjective pain susceptibility is accordingly higher the more apprehensive the individual feels about it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medizinfo.de/schmerz/rezeptor.htm Schmerzrezeptoren] in „MedizInfo“ about pain receptors; 20 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weiss.de/krankheiten/fibro/ursachen/schmerz-angst/ Schmerz und Angst] in „Praxisklinik Dr. med. Thomas Weiss“ about intensification of pain through anxiety; 20 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Further the female gender generally experiences physical pain notably more intensive and typically reacts with a higher level of anxiety. At the same time women are distinctly sensitive to pressure pain. According to respective assertions women's subjective suffering under the infliction of foot whipping therefore is significantly more severe. The acute pain sensations can hereby be experienced as largely intolerable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geschlechterstudien.de/1-1-schmerzforschung.html Schmerzforschung] in „GeschlechterStudien“ (gender studies) about pain research; 17 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mental ===
Seizing and withholding the footwear from a person in a situation of imprisonment, which is commonplace in many countries ([[Barefoot#Imprisonment and slavery]]), often has a disconsolating and victimizing effect on the individual. As bare feet are traditionally regarded as a token of subjection and captivity, the unaccustomed and largely reluctant exposure is often perceived as humiliating or oppressive. The increased physical [[vulnerability]] by having to remain barefoot often leads to trepidation and the feeling of insecurity.
This measure alone can therefore already cause significant distress.&lt;ref name="zimbabwe_prisoners"&gt;{{cite news|title=Long hours in a Harare Jail.|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/2018917.stm|accessdate=6 October 2014|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=1 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This circumstance is usually aggravated if the bare feet are the target for corporal punishment.
The feet are typically hidden away and protected by footwear in most social situations, hereby avoiding unwanted exposure. Therefore, the enforced exposure for the purpose of punishment is mostly perceived as a form of harassment. The obligatory restraints further add to the anxiety and humiliation of the captive.

Any form of methodical corporal punishment typically causes a high level of distress through the inflicted pain and the experience of being defenseless and unable to evade the situation. The mostly occurring loss of composure during the punishment as well as the experience of weakness and vulnerability often permanently damages a person’s [[self-esteem]].

Beating the undersides of a person's feet moreover conveys an especially steep imbalance in power between the executing party (prison staff or similar) towards the receiving individual (typically prison inmate). A rather private area of the body, which traditionally remains covered or not visible in the presence of other people, is forcibly exposed and beaten. This act represents a blunt intrusion into the sphere of personal privacy and an according elimination of [[personal boundaries]]. By this means the receiving person experiences his or her individual powerlessness against the executing authority in a particularly manifest way. This experience can also change or deconstruct the individual's [[Self-perception theory|self-perception]] and [[self-awareness]].

As a result, the experience of bastinado leads to drastic physical and mental suffering for the receiving individual and is therefore regarded as a highly effectual method of corporal punishment. 
Exploiting the effects of bastinado on a person, it is still frequently employed on prisoners in several countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9172">'''Foreclosure''' (also known as "foreclusion"; {{lang-fr|forclusion}}) is the English translation of a term that the French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] introduced into [[psychoanalysis]] to identify a specific psychical cause for [[psychosis]]. &lt;ref&gt;Dylan Evans, ''Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis'' (Routledge 1996) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to Élisabeth Roudinesco, the term was originally introduced into [[psychology]] 'in 1928, when [[Édouard Pichon]] published, in [[Pierre Janet]]'s review, his article on "The Psychological Significance of Negation in French": "...[and] borrowed the legal term ''forclusif'' to indicate facts that the speaker no longer sees as part of reality'.&lt;ref&gt;Roudinesco, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Christophe Laudou, the term was introduced by Damourette and Pichon.&lt;ref&gt;« À propos de Judith Butler. », Mouvements 6/2004 (no 36), p. 158-164, URL : www.cairn.info/revue-mouvements-2004-6-page-158.htm. DOI : 10.3917/mouv.036.0158.&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Freud vs Laforgue===
The publication took part against the background of the Twenties dispute between Freud and [[René Laforgue]] over [[scotomization]]. 'If I am not mistaken', Freud wrote in 1927, 'Laforgue would say in this case that the boy "scotomizes" his perception of the woman's lack of a penis. A new technical term is justified when it describes a new fact or emphasizes it. This is not the case here'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "Fetishism", ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; Freud went on to suggest that if one wanted to 'reserve the word "''[[Psychological repression|Verdrängung]]''" ["repression"] for the affect, then the correct German word for the vicissitude of the idea would be "''[[Disavowal|Verleugnung]]''" ["disavowal"]'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Fetishism", pp. 352–3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lacan's introduction of foreclosure==

In 1938 Lacan relates the origin of psychosis to an exclusion of the father from the family structure thereby reducing this structure to a mother-child relationship. &lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, "Les complexes familiaux dans la formation de l'individu", Paris, Navarin 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, when working on the distinctions between the real, imaginary and symbolic father, he specifies that it is the absence of the symbolic father which is linked to psychosis.

Lacan uses the Freudian term, "''Verwerfung''", which the ''Standard Edition'' translates as "repudiation", as a specific defence mechanism different from repression, "''Verdrängung''", in which "the ego rejects the incompatible idea together with its affect and behaves as if the idea has never occurred to the ego at all."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "the Neuro-Psychoses of Defence", ''SE III''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954 basing himself on a reading of the "Wolf Man"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "From the History of an Infantile Neurosis", ''SE XVII''&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan identifies ''Verwerfung'' as the specific mechanism of psychosis where an element is rejected outside the symbolic order as if it has never existed.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'', "Reply to Jean Hyppolite's commentary on Freud's ''Negation''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 in his Seminar on Psychoses he translates ''Verwerfung'' as ''forclusion'', that is foreclosure.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''The Seminar. Book III. The Psychoses, 1955-56'', trans. Russell Grigg, New York, Norton, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  "Let us extract from several of Freud's texts a term that is sufficiently articulated in them to designate in them a function of the unconscious that is distinct from the repressed. Let us take as demonstrated the essence of my Seminar on the Psychoses, namely, that this term refers to psychosis: this term is ''Verwerfung'' (foreclosure)".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lacan and psychosis==

The problematic Lacan sought to address with the twin tools of foreclosure and the signifier was that of the difference between psychosis and neurosis, as manifested in and indicated by language usage. It was common analytic ground that "when psychotics speak they always have some meanings that are too fixed, and some that are far too loose, they have a different relation to language, and a different way of speaking from neurotics."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Hill, ''Lacan for Beginners'' (London 1997) pp. 113 and 122&lt;/ref&gt; Freud, following [[Eugen Bleuler|Bleuler]] and [[Carl Jung|Jung]] had pointed to 'a number of changes in ''speech''...in schizophrenics...''words'' are subjected to the same process as that which makes the dream'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) pp. 202–4&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan used foreclosure to explain why.

When Lacan first uses the Freudian concept of ''Verwerfung'' (repudiation) in his search for a specific mechanism for psychosis, it is not clear what is repudiated (castration, speech). It is in 1957 in his article "On a question preliminary to any possible treatment of psychosis"&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' New York Norton, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; that he advances the notion that it is the [[Name-of-the-Father]] (a fundamental signifier) that is the object of foreclosure. In this way Lacan combines two of his main themes on the causality of psychosis: the absence of the father and the concept of ''Verwerfung''. This ideas remains central to Lacan's thinking on psychosis throughout the rest of his work.

Lacan considered the father to play a vital role in breaking the initial mother/child duality and introducing the child to the wider world of culture, language, institutions and social reality — the [[The Symbolic|Symbolic]] world — the father being "the human being who stands for the law and order that the mother plants in the life of the child...widens the child's view of the world."&lt;ref&gt;[[D. W. Winnicott]], ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (Penguin 1973) pp. 115–6&lt;/ref&gt; The result in normal development is "proper separation from the mother, as marked out by the Names-of-the-father."&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Lacan postulates the existence of a paternal function (the "[[Name of the Father]]" or "primordial signifier") which allows the realm of [[the Symbolic]] to be bound to the realms of [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the Imaginary]] and [[the Real]]. This function prevents the developing child from being engulfed by its mother and allows him/her to emerge as a separate entity in his/her own right. It is a symbol of parental authority (a general symbol that represents the power of father of the [[Oedipus complex]]) that brings the child into the realm of the Symbolic by forcing him/her to act and to verbalise as an adult. As a result, the three realms are integrated in a way that is conducive to the creation of meaning and successful communication by means of what Lacan calls a [[Borromean knot]].

When the Name-of-the-Father is foreclosed for a particular subject, it leaves a hole in the Symbolic order which can never be filled. The subject can then be said to have a psychotic structure, even if he shows none of the classical signs of psychosis. When the foreclosed Name-of-the-Father re-appears in the Real, the subject is unable to assimilate it and the result of this collision between the subject and the inassimilable signifier of the Name-of-the-father is the entry into psychosis proper characterized by the onset of hallucinations and/or delusions.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Seminar III, ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, when the paternal function is "foreclosed" from the Symbolic order, the realm of the Symbolic is insufficiently bound to the realm of the Imaginary and failures in meaning may occur (the Borromean knot becomes undone and the three realms completely disconnected), with "a disorder caused at the most personal juncture between the subject and his sense of being alive."&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits, ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; Psychosis is experienced after some environmental sign in the form of a [[signifier]] which the individual cannot assimilate is triggered, and this entails that "the Name-of-the-Father, is foreclosed, ''verworfen'', is called into symbolic opposition to the subject."&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits, ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; The fabric of the individual's reality is ripped apart and no meaningful Symbolic sense can be made of experience. "Absence of transcendence of the Oedipus places the subject under the regime of foreclosure or non-distinction between the symbolic and the real';&lt;ref&gt;Anika Lemaire, ''Jacques Lacan'' (1979) p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; and psychotic [[delusions]] or [[hallucinations]] are the consequent result of the individual's striving to account for what he/she experiences.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Fragmentalists carved the universe up into smaller and smaller pieces until they reached such a fine level of subdivision that they could no longer observe the pieces directly." (Stewart &amp; Cohen, p.198) "As the tale of the Fragmentalists demonstrates, reductionist science usually looks for a mathematical equation, formula, or process that describes general features of the universe." (Stewart &amp; Cohen, p.200)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fragmentalism has also been defined as ''the notion that knowledge is a growing collection of substantiated facts or "nuggets of truth."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pope ML|title=Personal construction of formal knowledge|journal=Interchange|url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/VQ4L33X920880824.pdf|volume=13|issue=4|pages=3–14|year=1982|doi=10.1007/BF01191417}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anti-realism|Anti-realists]] use the term fragmentalism in arguments that the world does not exist of separable [[entity|entities]], instead consisting of wholes. For example, advocates of this position declare that: &lt;blockquote&gt;The linear deterministic approach to nature and technology promoted a fragmented perception of reality, and a loss of the ability to foresee, to adequately evaluate, in all their complexity, global crises in ecology, civilization and education.&lt;ref&gt;Anatoly P. Liferov, Global Education as a Trend Reflecting the Problems of Today and Meeting the Requirements of Tomorrow http://www.indiana.edu/~isre/NEWSLETTER/vol6no2/global.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This term is usually applied to [[reductionism|reductionist]] modes of thought, frequently with the related pejorative term of ''[[scientism]]''. This usage is popular amongst some ecological activists: &lt;blockquote&gt;There is a need now to move away from [[scientism]] and the ideology of cause-and-effect determinism toward a radical [[empiricism]], such as [[William James]] proposed, as an [[epistemology]] of science.&lt;ref&gt;Yunkaporta on Kakkib and Oneness, Tyson Yunkaporta, Friday, January 05, 2007 http://bioregionalanimism.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; These perspectives are not new and in the early twentieth century, [[William James]] noted that rationalist science emphasized what he termed fragmentation and disconnection.&lt;ref name=Lumpkin/&gt;
 Such anti-realist rhetoric also underpins many criticisms of the scientific method: &lt;blockquote&gt;The scientific method only acknowledges monophasic consciousness. The method is a specialized system that focuses on studying small and distinctive parts in isolation, which results in fragmented knowledge.&lt;ref name=Lumpkin&gt;Tara W. Lumpkin, ''Perceptual Diversity: Is Polyphasic Consciousness Necessary for Global Survival?'' December 28, 2006, http://bioregionalanimism.blogspot.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
An alternative usage of this term is in [[cognitive psychology]]. Here, [[George Kelly (psychologist)|George Kelly]] developed "constructive alternativism" as a form of [[personal construct psychology]], this provided an alternative to what he saw as "accumulative fragmentalism". In this theory, knowledge is seen as the construction of successful mental models of the exterior world, rather than the accumulation of independent "nuggets of truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pope ML and Watts M|title=Constructivist Goggles: Implications for Process in Teaching and Learning Physics|journal=Eur.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8617">[[File:Erik Erikson.png|thumb|Erik Erikson(1902-1994) was the first to use the term generativity.]]

The term '''generativity''' was coined by the psychoanalyst [[Erik Erikson]] in 1950 to denote "a concern for establishing and guiding the next generation."&lt;ref&gt;Slater, C. L. (2003). Generativity Versus Stagnation: An Elaboration of Erikson's Adult Stage of Human Development. Journal of Adult Development, 10(1), 53-65. Retrieved February 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He first used the term while defining the Care stage in his theory of the stages of psychosocial development.

[[Jonathan Zittrain]] adopted the term in 2006 to refer to “the ability of a technology platform or technology ecosystem to create, generate or produce new output, structure or behavior without input from the originator of the system.”&lt;ref name=GenInt&gt;Zittrain, J. L. (2006). The Generative Internet. Harvard Law Review, 119, 1974-2040. doi:10.1145/1435417.1435426&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1950 Erik Erikson created the term generativity to explain the Care stage in his theory of the stages of psychosocial development. The Care stage encompasses the middle ages of one’s life, from 40 through 64. Generativity was defined as the “ability to transcend personal interests to provide care and concern for younger and older generations.”&lt;ref&gt;Hutchison, Elizabeth D. Dimensions of Human Behavior: The Changing Life Course. 4th ed., vol. 10, SAGE Publications Ltd, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It took over 30 years for generativity to become a subject of empirical research. Modern psychoanalysts, starting in the early 1990s, have included a concern for one’s legacy, referred to as an “inner desire for immortality”, in the definition of generativity.&lt;ref name=mcadams&gt;McAdams, D. P., &amp; De St. Aubin, E. (1992). A Theory of Generativity and Its Assessment through Self-Report, Behavioral Acts, and Narrative Themes in Autobiography. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 62(6), 1003-1015. Retrieved February 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the term has been adopted by people who deal with technology, first used by Johnathan Zittrain in 2006. Generativity in technology is defined as “the ability of a technology platform or technology ecosystem to create, generate or produce new output, structure or behavior without input from the originator of the system.”&lt;ref name="GenInt" /&gt; An example of this could be the [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile operating systems, for which developers have created millions of unique applications. It has been argued that the open Internet is both an inspiration of generativity and a means to spread the products of generativity. However, some people including Johnathan Zittrain fear that society and technology are moving away from a generative internet, claiming “A shift in consumer priorities from generativity to stability will compel undesirable responses from regulators and markets and, if unaddressed, could prove decisive in closing today’s open computing environments.”&lt;ref name=GenInt /&gt;

== Use in Psychology ==
Psychologically, generativity is concern for the future, a need to nurture and guide younger people and contribute to the next generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/732894649|title=Dimensions of a new identity|last=1902-1994.|first=Erikson, Erik H. (Erik Homburger),|publisher=W.W. Norton and Co|isbn=9780393009231|oclc=732894649}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erikson argued that this usually develops during middle age (which spans ages 40 through 64) in keeping with his stage-model of [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|psychosocial development]].&lt;ref name=stage&gt;HQ, Psychology. "Erikson's Stages Of Development - Stages 7 And 8". Psychologynoteshq.com. N. p., 2017. Web. 27 Feb. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; After having experienced old age himself, Erikson believed that generativity maintains a more important role in later life than he initially had thought.

In Erikson’s theory Generativity is contrasted with Stagnation.&lt;ref name=stage /&gt; During this stage, people contribute to the next generation through caring, teaching, engaging in creative work which contributes to society. Generativity involves answering the question "Can I Make My Life Count?", and in this process, finding your life’s work and contributing to the development of others through activities such as volunteering, mentoring, and contributing to future generations. It has also been described as a concern for one's legacy, accepting the independence lives of family and increasing philanthropic pursuits.&lt;ref name=mcadams /&gt; Generative concern leads to concrete goals and actions such as "providing a narrative schematic of the generative self to the next generation".&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, S.-T. "Generativity In Later Life: Perceived Respect From Younger Generations As A Determinant Of Goal Disengagement And Psychological Well-Being". The Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences 64B.1 (2009): 45-54. Web. 27 Feb. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

McAdams developed a 20-item scale to assess generativity, and to help discover who it is that is nurturing and leading the next generation.&lt;ref name="mcadams" /&gt; McAdam's model is not restricted to stages, with generativity able to be a concern throughout adulthood, not just in middle adulthood, as Erikson suggested. Example items include "I try to pass along the knowledge that I have gained through my experiences", "I have a responsibility to improve the neighborhood in which I live", and (reversed) "In general, my actions do not have a positive effect on other people."

== Use in Technology ==

Generativity in technology refers to cases where a technology supports the creation of novel products. Such technologies are referred to as [[generative systems]]. Canonical examples are the PC and the Internet.&lt;ref name="GenInt" /&gt; From its inception, the internet has acted as a generative force allowing users to create and communicate in ways unimagined but foreseen by its creators who for this purpose built-in an openness and hardware and software agnosticism.&lt;ref&gt;"Cultures Of The Internet". Google Books. N. p., 2017. Web. 6 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zittrain was first to apply this term outside psychology, in cases where a generative technology leads to "unanticipated change through unfiltered contributions from broad and varied audiences."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF5210/h14/slides/group-lectures/generativity-updated.pdf. N. p., 2017. Web. 6 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Zittrain has also highlighted that precarious nature of generative technology: arguing that features which, for instance, may enhance security and stability may, even unintentionally reduce or destroy a generativity in a system. He highlighted cases in which apparently innocuous producer, consumer, and government actions from a move away from PCs to one-way systems such as "smart" appliances cause a decline in generativity.&lt;ref name="GenInt" /&gt; As a result, he emphasised the need to be clear about treating generativity, rather than apparent means supporting this as the key valued characteristic of the system. In the case of the internet/PC complex this is its capacity as a generative networked grid, rather than traits associated with this, such as "open internet" or “[[network neutrality]]”. He termed a focus on these mere-means to the end of generativity a "myopic" "end-to-end theory" which confused means with ends. Zittrain argued:&lt;blockquote&gt;focusing on “network” without regard to a particular network policy’s influence on the design of net- work endpoints such as PCs. As a result of this focus, political advo- cates of end-to-end are too often myopic; many writers seem to pre- sume current PC and OS architecture to be fixed in an “open” position. If they can be persuaded to see a larger picture, they may agree to some compromises at the network level. If complete fidelity to end-to- end network neutrality persists, our PCs may be replaced by informa- tion appliances or may undergo a transformation from open platforms to gated communities to prisons, creating a consumer information en- vironment that betrays the very principles that animate end-to-end theory. (&lt;ref name="GenInt" /&gt; p. 1978)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4189">'''Guru Vandana''' means “Reverence for the Teacher” – it is the thanksgiving from a student to a teacher, expressing his or her gratitude.  The Guru Vandana program provides a platform for students to honor their teachers for imparting knowledge and wisdom to them.

==GURU==

The concept of [[Guru]] is as old as humanity itself. Primarily, the word Guru means a 'teacher' and as such it is a universal concept based on the idea of transmitting knowledge from a person, who knows something, to an ignorant student or disciple. In an extended view, a Guru can also be a priest, a rabbi, a master, a school teacher, even a father or a mother.
Guru does not mean a teacher imparting formal training but a person who contributes to the overall development and learning of an individual.

Guru transforms his disciple through his presence and spiritual knowledge. According to [[RamaKrishna Prarahamsa]] Spiritual knowledge can not be attained completely by reading books. But for obtaining complete spiritual enlightenment Guru’s presence is a must. Only when there is a strong bond between Guru and [[Shishya]] spiritual enlightenment might takes place.

'''Origins of [[Guru Shishya]] Parampara'''

Thus our great [[sanathana dharma]] tradition has been enriched by the GURU-SISHYA relationship. [[Lord Rama]]'s greatness lay in His relationship with His most loyal disciple [[HANUMAN]] who taught the essence of [[Ramanamamritim]].  Lord [[Krishna]] gave us the [[Bhagavad Gita]], thanks to his devoted and most trusted disciple [[Arjuna]].  Saint [[Ramakrishna Paramahamsa]] gave to the world [[Swami Vivekananda]] who in turn gave to the world the [[Ramakrishna Mission]], embodying the soul of India. Saint Thyagaraja, an avatar of [[Sage Valmiki]], composed hundreds of soulful Krithis in praise of God. Two Krithis, in particular, refer to the GURU'S role in guiding the seeker on the right path.  Guru leka in 'Gowrimanohari' raga is a Krithi in which the Saint of [[Thiruvaiyar]] sings how one who is trapped in the jungle of desire, can come out of it with help of the right [[Guru]].  Saint Thyagaraja says however learned and good a person might be, life would be meaningless without the guidance of a [[Satguru]].  In another Krithi, Sri Naradamuni Gururaya ganti in [[Bhairavi]] raga, Thyagaraja explains how [[Satguru Smaranam]] helps one in getting rid of ignorance.

==In modern times==

[[United States|American]] [[Hindu Education Foundation]] (HEF) had conducted the program in [[Houston]] in which over 30 teachers and a principal were honored by students.  Children from Houston Balagokulams area picked up their favorite teachers. Acharya Premchand Sridhar of Arya Samaj Houston presided over the program.  The program started with Sridhar lighting the lamp and it was followed by cultural programs and with the explanation of Hindu Concept of Gurus. After the felicitation of teachers Veda Vrinda group chanted the section of the Taittariya Upanishad known as the Vedic Commencement Address.  Columbus chapter of HEF is planning to conduct similar program in October 2008.

Guruvandana is also performed by disciples to spiritual masters. During GuruVandana program [[GuruGita]] is recited by disciple to honor his guru.  [[GuruGita]] forms section of [[Skanda Purana]]. In [[Bangalore]] Guruvandana was offered to [[Sankaracharya]] of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam, Sri Jayendra Saraswathi. Despite rains lots of people gathered in Malleshwaram to felicitate their Spiritual Guru.  In [[ISKCON]] temples Guruvandana is performed for spiritual Guru Srila [[Prabhupada]] throughout the year.

==In other religions==

Apart from Hinduism Guru-Shishya concept is followed in other religions like Jain, Sikh, Buddhism. In fact the word Sikh has origins from Sanskrit 'shishya'. Jains celebrate Guru Vandana as part of their rituals.

He is the leader of the Media Action Network for Asian Americans, which he co-founded in 1992.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3076585.stm|title=Banzai sparks US protests|publisher=BBC NEWS|date=July 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/manaaLA?v=info Facebook page of group listing year of founding]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Asian America Through the Lens: History, Representation and Identities|author=Jun Xing, Chun Hsing|year=1998|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=0-7619-9176-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1207/S15327728JMME1601_6|url=http://www.leaonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327728JMME1601_6?cookieSet=1&amp;journalCode=jmme|title= Book Reviews| journal=Journal of Mass Media Ethics |volume= 16 |issue=1 |page=62 |accessdate=2008-01-06|last=|first=|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a contributing columnist for the ''[[Rafu Shimpo]]'', and debates publicly on [[Asian American]] issues.  During the 1980s, Aoki was part of the production staff for the ''[[American Top 40]]'' radio program.

==Campaigns==

===Sarah Silverman controversy===
In July 2001, Aoki became embroiled in a public controversy stemming from his objection to a joke told by comedian [[Sarah Silverman]], which involved her use of the [[term of disparagement|ethnic slur]] "[[chink]]", in an interview on the July 11, 2001 episode of ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Late Night with Conan O'Brien" July 11, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In the interview, Silverman explained that a friend had advised her on how to avoid [[jury|jury duty]] by writing a racial slur on the selection form, "something really inappropriate, like, 'I hate chinks'." However, Silverman said that she ultimately decided that she did not want to be thought of as a [[racism|racist]] and instead wrote, "I ''love'' chinks." The [[Associated Press]] quoted Aoki: "There is no excuse for something like this to have made the air. The term is the most offensive possible reference to a person of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] descent." [[NBC]] and [[Conan O'Brien]] issued an apology, but Silverman did not, insisting later on the July 26, 2001 episode of ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' that she did not believe that Aoki was genuinely offended, but exploiting the opportunity for publicity.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Politically Incorrect]]''. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. July 26, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Silverman and Aoki later appeared together on the August 22, 2001 episode of ''[[Politically Incorrect]],'' along with host [[Bill Maher]] and panelists [[David Spade]] and [[Anne-Marie Johnson]], the latter of whom was chair of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] Ethnic Employment Opportunity Committee.  After Silverman repeated the joke for exposition's sake, she opined that it made an implicit statement about the wrongness of [[racism]], rather than legitimizing it. Johnson, however, questioned the humor in the joke, and Aoki opined that such slurs should not be used in an off-the-cuff manner because it legitimized their use, and that use of the word "chink" was no better than the use of the word "[[nigger]]". Aoki, while acknowledging that [[satire]] was a legitimate practice, asserted that Silverman's execution of it was not successful because it ran the risk that people would assume she actually subscribed to the racist viewpoint of her character.

===''Banzai'' controversy===
In July 2003 Media Action Network protested the British program [[Banzai (TV series)|''Banzai'']], which is produced by [[Channel 4]]. Following the first U.S. broadcast of the series on the [[Fox Network]] on July 13, 2003, the Media Action Network accused the program, a spoof betting show that parodies Japanese game shows, of employing demeaning stereotypes of Asians. About 20 members of the group carried signs and shouted slogans outside a presentation by the Fox network to TV critics in Hollywood. Aoki commented, "This is like an Asian minstrel show. Can you imagine the black version of Banzai?" Fox spokesman Scott Grogin responded by saying, "We've received an entire range of comments on the show, both pro and con", and that as a satire, the show should be viewed as "tongue-in-cheek". According to Aoki, in discussions with the MANAA, Fox offered to include a disclaimer at the beginning of the show, but Aoki indicated that this would not assuage the MANAA, who wished the program not be broadcast at all.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

'''Houston's first sit-in''' was held Friday, March 4, 1960 at the [[Weingarten%27s|Weingarten's]] grocery store lunch counter located at 4110 Almeda Road, [[Houston]], [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Houston-honors-TSU-pioneers-for-sit-in-that-made-1694509.php&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[Sit-in|sit-in]] was a nonviolent, direct action protest led by more than a dozen Texas Southern University students.  The sit-in was organized to protest Houston's legal segregation laws.  The students met on [[Texas_Southern_University|Texas Southern University]]'s campus and the [[YMCA]] located on Wheeler Street to organize the sit-in.  They called their meetings 'war room' sessions.  In these sessions, the students strategized like a military unit on how they would dismantle Houston's disenfranchisement laws.  They believed that their peaceful approach was a tactic that would break Houston's discriminatory practices. It worked. The students called themselves the Progressive Youth Association (PYA). PYA was formed to address the social, political and economic issues that African-Americans faced in Houston.  The Houston collegians were inspired by students at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, who held a [[Greensboro_sit-ins|sit-in in Greensboro]], North Carolina on February 1, 1960.

On the day of the Houston sit-in, the students met at a flag pole located at Hannah Hall on TSU's campus. They said a prayer; lined up in pairs, and begin to march to the Weingarten's lunch counter. As they marched down Wheeler Street, they sang black spirituals. Others joined in the rally as the students marched down Wheeler Street. Upon arriving at Weingarten's, the students went into the store and sat at the [[Lunch_counter|lunch counter]]. Customers and employees hurled insults at them. They were never served. However, this did not deter the students from holding sit-ins at other [[Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States|segregated]] businesses in Houston. 

As a result of the students' actions, Houston leaders, black and white, met to discuss how to peacefully desegregate Houston.  The students were unaware of the meetings. Media blackouts were held by white owned media about the students' initiatives to end racial segregation in Houston. However, not long after the students held the March 1 sit-in, Houston businesses quietly desegregated. The revolutionary actions of TSU students and others at [[Historically_black_colleges_and_universities|Historically Black Colleges and Universities]] (HBCUs) played a role in the U.S. ultimately signing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law.

Fifty years later, Serbino Sandifer-Walker, a journalism professor at the same university, organized a march with the original students, current students, city leaders, state leaders, and many others to commemorate this historic day.  A U.S. post office now sits at the location. &lt;ref&gt;http://abc13.com/education/tsu-students-recreate-first-sit-in-in-houston-in-1960/1231830/&lt;/ref&gt; However, a Texas Historical Marker sits in the front of the facility to commemorate the courageous Texas Southern University students who led that first sit-in, which played a major role in the desegregation of Houston, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/How-TSU-students-changed-history-1694527.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://houstonstudentmovement.com&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://abc13.com/news/civil-rights-protests-in-houston/1164468/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Born-Serve-Southern-University-American/dp/0806160020&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of human rights has been highly influential within [[international law]], global and regional institutions.&lt;ref name=twsUnitedNations/&gt; Actions by [[Sovereign state|states]] and [[non-governmental organisations]] form a basis of [[public policy]] worldwide. The idea of human rights&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Beitz |2009 |p=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that "if the public discourse of peacetime global society can be said to have a common moral language, it is that of human rights". The strong claims made by the doctrine of human rights continue to provoke considerable [[scepticism]] and debates about the content, nature and justifications of human rights to this day. The precise meaning of the term ''[[Rights|right]]'' is controversial and is the subject of continued philosophical debate;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Shaw |2008 |p=265 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while there is consensus that human rights encompasses a wide variety of rights&lt;ref name=twsBritannica/&gt; such as the [[right to a fair trial]], protection against [[slavery|enslavement]], prohibition of [[genocide]], [[Freedom of speech|free speech]]&lt;ref name=twsMacmillan&gt;Macmillan Dictionary, [http://www.macmillandictionary.com/us/dictionary/american/human-rights human rights - definition], Retrieved August 14, 2014, "the rights that everyone should have in a society, including the right to express opinions about the government or to have protection from harm"&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[right to education]] (including the right to [[Comprehensive sex education|comprehensive sexuality education]], among others), there is disagreement about which of these particular rights should be included within the general framework of human rights;&lt;ref name=twsStanfordEncyclopedia/&gt; some thinkers suggest that human rights should be a minimum requirement to avoid the worst-case abuses, while others see it as a higher standard.&lt;ref name=twsStanfordEncyclopedia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: an evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the light of emerging neurotechnologies, four new rights were identified: [[Cognitive liberty|the right to cognitive liberty]], the right to mental privacy, the right to mental integrity, and the right to psychological continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ienca |first1=Marcello  |last2= Andorno |first2=Roberto |date=2017-04-26 |title=Towards new human rights in the age of neuroscience and neurotechnology|url=https://lsspjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40504-017-0050-1 |journal=Life Sciences, Society and Policy |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=5  |doi=10.1186/s40504-017-0050-1 |pmid=28444626  |pmc=5447561  |access-date=2018-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/26/new-human-rights-to-protect-against-mind-hacking-and-brain-data-theft-proposed|title=New human rights to protect against 'mind hacking' and brain data theft proposed|last=Sample|first=Ian|date=2017-04-26|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the basic ideas that animated the [[human rights movement]] developed in the aftermath of the [[Second World War]] and the events of [[the Holocaust]],&lt;ref name=twsGaryJBass/&gt; culminating in the adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in Paris by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1948. Ancient peoples did not have the same modern-day conception of universal human rights.&lt;ref name=Freeman15&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Freeman |2002 |pp=15–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The true forerunner of human rights discourse was the concept of [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]] which appeared as part of the medieval [[natural law]] tradition that became prominent during the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] with such philosophers as [[John Locke]], [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] and [[Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui]] and which featured prominently in the political discourse of the [[American Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=twsGaryJBass/&gt; From this foundation, the modern human rights arguments emerged over the latter half of the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Moyn |2010 |p=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly as a reaction to slavery, torture, genocide and war crimes,&lt;ref name=twsGaryJBass/&gt; as a realisation of inherent human vulnerability and as being a precondition for the possibility of a [[just society]].&lt;ref name=twsBritannica/&gt;

[[File:Cyrus Cylinder front.jpg|thumb|The [[Cyrus Cylinder]], created by king [[Cyrus the Great]], is sometimes argued to be the world's first charter of human rights.]]

The history of human rights has not been entirely progressive. Many established rights would be replaced by other less tolerant systems. Stable institutions may be uprooted such as in cases of conflict such as war and terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights: Commitment and Betrayal. Author, M. G. Chitkara. Publisher, APH Publishing, 1996. ISBN, 8170247276, 9788170247272.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest conceptualisation of human rights is credited to ideas about [[natural rights]] emanating from [[natural law]].

The [[Northeast Africa]]n civilization of [[Ancient Egypt]]&lt;ref&gt;Baines, John R., et al (24 August 2018).  [https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Egypt "Ancient Egypt."]  ''Encyclopaedia Britannica''.

Retrieved from Britannica.com, 16 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Pharaoh]] [[Bakenranef|Bocchoris]] (725-720 BC) promoted [[individual rights]], suppressed imprisonment for debt, and reformed laws relating to the transferral of property.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

The first recording of human rights were inscribed by [[Cyrus the Great]], the founder of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], into the [[Cyrus Cylinder]]. The Cyrus Cylinder is a clay tablet created in 539 B.C. soon after the Achaemenid conquest of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]]. Additionally it stated the freedom to practice one's faith without persecution and forced conversions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kuhrt |first1=Amélie |title=The Cyrus Cylinder and Achaemenid Imperial Policy |journal=Journal for the Study of the Old Testament |date=February 1983 |volume=8 |issue=25 |pages=83–97 |doi=10.1177/030908928300802507 |issn=0309-0892}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van der Spek |first1=Robartus J. |editor1-last=HENKELMAN |editor1-first=Wouter FM |editor2-last=JONES |editor2-first=Charles E. |editor3-last=KOZUH |editor3-first=Michael |editor4-last=Woods |editor4-first=C. |title=Cyrus the Great, Exiles and Foreign Gods.

The [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryan]] Emperor [[Ashoka]], who ruled from 268 to 232 BCE, established the [[List of largest empires in India|largest empire]] in [[South Asia]]. Following the reportedly destructive [[Kalinga War]], Ashoka adopted Buddhism and abandoned an expansionist policy in favor of humanitarian reforms.  The [[Edicts of Ashoka]] were erected throughout his empire, containing the 'Law of Piety'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Draper |first1=G. I. a.

Later documents pertaining to human rights can be referenced in the [[Constitution of Medina]] (622), [[Al-Risalah al-Huquq]] (late 7th to early 8th century), [[Magna Carta]] (1215), the [[German Peasants' War]] [[Twelve Articles]] (1525), the [[Bill of Rights 1689|English Bill of Rights]] (1689), the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] (1789), and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] in the [[United States Constitution]] (1791).&lt;ref name=twsStanfordEncyclopedia/&gt;

The [[statute of Kalisz]] (1264), bestowed privileges to the Jewish minority in the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]] such as protection from discrimination and hate speech.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Lewin, The Jewish community in Poland, Philosophical Library, the University of Michigan, 1985 p.19&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Moyn]] suggests that the concept of human rights is intertwined with the modern sense of [[History of citizenship|citizenship]], which did not emerge until the past few hundred years.&lt;ref name=twsSamuelMoyn&gt;Samuel Moyn, August 30-edition of September 6, 2010, The Nation, [http://www.thenation.com/article/153993/human-rights-history# Human Rights in History: Human rights emerged not in the 1940s but the 1970s, and on the ruins of prior dreams], Retrieved August 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 16th–18th century ===
[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|''Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen'' approved by the [[National Assembly of France]], 26 August 1789]]

17th-century English philosopher [[John Locke]] discussed natural rights in his work, identifying them as being "life, liberty, and estate (property)", and argued that such fundamental rights could not be surrendered in the [[social contract]]. In Britain in 1689, the English [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] and the Scottish [[Claim of Right Act 1689|Claim of Right]] each made illegal a range of oppressive governmental actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain's unwritten constitution|url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution|publisher=British Library|accessdate=27 November 2015|quote=The key landmark is the Bill of Rights (1689), which established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown ... providing for the regular meeting of Parliament, free elections to the Commons, free speech in parliamentary debates, and some basic human rights, most famously freedom from ‘cruel or unusual punishment’.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two major revolutions occurred during the 18th century, in the United States (1776) and in France (1789), leading to the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] respectively, both of which articulated certain human rights. Additionally, the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] of 1776 encoded into law a number of fundamental [[civil rights]] and civil freedoms.

{{quote|We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.|United States Declaration of Independence, 1776}}

These were followed by developments in philosophy of human rights by philosophers such as [[Thomas Paine]], [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.W.F. Hegel]] during the 18th and 19th centuries. The term ''human rights'' probably came into use some time between Paine's ''The Rights of Man'' and [[William Lloyd Garrison]]'s 1831 writings in ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', in which he stated that he was trying to enlist his readers in "the great cause of human rights". Although the term had been used by at least one author as early as 1742.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

=== 19th century ===

In the 19th century, human rights became a central concern over the issue of [[slavery]].&lt;ref name=twsGaryJBass/&gt; A number of reformers, notably British Member of Parliament [[William Wilberforce]], worked towards the abolition of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and [[Abolitionism|abolition of slavery]]. This was achieved across the [[British Empire]] by the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]], which was [[Blockade of Africa|enforced internationally]] by the Royal Navy under treaties Britain negotiated with other nations,&lt;ref name="Lovejoy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lovejoy |first=Paul E. |title=Transformations in slavery: a history of slavery in Africa |page=290 |location=New York |edition=2nd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0521780124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]]. In the United States, all the northern states had [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolished]] the institution of slavery between 1777 and 1804, although southern states clung tightly to the "peculiar institution". Conflict and debates over the expansion of slavery to new territories constituted one of the reasons for the southern states' [[secession]] and the [[American Civil War]]. During the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|reconstruction period]] immediately following the war, several amendments to the [[United States Constitution]] were made. These included the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th amendment]], banning slavery, the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th amendment]], assuring full citizenship and civil rights to all people born in the United States, and the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th amendment]], guaranteeing [[African Americans]] the right to vote. In [[Russia]], the reformer [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]] ended serfdom in 1861,&lt;ref name=twsGaryJBass/&gt; although the freed serfs often faced restrictions of their mobility within the nation.

Many groups and movements have achieved profound social changes over the course of the 20th century in the name of human rights. In [[Europe]] and North America, [[trade union|labour unions]] brought about laws granting workers the right to strike, establishing minimum work conditions and forbidding or regulating [[child labor|child labour]]. The [[women's rights]] movement succeeded in gaining for many women the right to [[voting|vote]]. [[Wars of national liberation|National liberation movements]] in many countries succeeded in driving out [[colony|colonial]] powers. One of the most influential was [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s movement to free his native India from British rule. Movements by long-oppressed racial and religious minorities succeeded in many parts of the world, among them the [[civil rights movement]], and more recent movements, on behalf of women and minorities in the United States.

The establishment of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], the 1864 [[Lieber Code]] and the first of the [[Geneva Conventions]] in 1864 laid the foundations of [[International humanitarian law]], to be further developed following the two [[World Wars]].

=== 20th century ===

The World Wars, and the huge losses of life and gross abuses of human rights that took place during them, were a driving force behind the development of modern [[international human rights instruments|human rights instruments]]. The [[League of Nations]] was established in 1919 at the negotiations over the [[Treaty of Versailles]] following the end of [[World War I]]. The League's goals included disarmament, preventing war through collective security, settling disputes between countries through negotiation and diplomacy, and improving global welfare. Enshrined in its charter was a mandate to promote many of the rights later included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

At the 1945 [[Yalta Conference]], the Allied Powers agreed to create a new body to supplant the League's role; this was to be the [[United Nations]]. The United Nations has played an important role in international human-rights law since its creation. Following the World Wars, the United Nations and its members developed much of the discourse and the bodies of law that now make up [[international humanitarian law]] and [[international human rights law]]. Analyst Belinda Cooper argued that human rights organisations flourished in the 1990s, possibly as a result of the dissolution of the [[Western bloc|western]] and [[Eastern bloc|eastern]] Cold War blocs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/books/review/Cooper-t.html|title=Book Review - The Last Utopia - Human Rights in History - By Samuel Moyn|first=Belinda|last=Cooper|date=September 24, 2010|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ludwig Hoffmann argues that human rights became more widely emphasised in the latter half of the twentieth century because it "provided a language for political claim making and counter-claims, liberal-democratic, but also socialist and post colonialist.&lt;ref name="Hoffmann2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stefan-Ludwig Hoffmann|title=Human Rights in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ES8ptQvfVvAC&amp;pg=PA2|date=December 13, 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49410-6|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam
{{Main|Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam}}
The CDHR was signed by member states of the OIC in 1990 at the 19th Conference of Foreign Ministers held in Cairo, Egypt. It was seen as the answer to the UDHR. In fact, the CDHR was "patterned after the UN-sponsored UDHR of 1948".&lt;ref name="Ahsan, Abdullah 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=al-Ahsan |first1=Abdullah |title=Law, Religion and Human Dignity in the Muslim World Today: An Examination of OIC's Cairo Declaration of Human Rights |journal=Journal of Law and Religion |date=2008 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=569–597 |doi=10.1017/S0748081400001715 |url=http://irep.iium.edu.my/7070 |accessdate=11 August 2018 |language=en |issn=0748-0814 |hdl=hein.journals/jlrel24 |jstor=25654330}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object of the CDHR was to "serve as a guide for member states on human rights issues. CDHR translated the Qur'anic teachings as follows: "All men are equal in terms of basic human dignity and basic obligations and responsibilities, without any discrimination on the basis of race, colour, language, belief, sex, religion, political affiliation, social status or other considerations. True religion is the guarantee for enhancing such dignity along the path to human integrity.&lt;ref name="Ahsan, Abdullah 2009"/&gt; The CDHR referenced Islamic [[Sharia]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/cairodeclaration.html|title=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library|website=hrlibrary.umn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes [[Quran]], [[Hadith]], prophetic teachings and Islamic legal tradition.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Philosophy==
{{Main|Philosophy of human rights}}
The philosophy of human rights attempts to examine the underlying basis of the concept of human rights and critically looks at its content and justification. Several theoretical approaches have been advanced to explain how and why human rights have become a part of social expectations.

One of the oldest Western philosophies of human rights is that they are a product of a natural law, stemming from different philosophical or religious grounds. Other theories hold that human rights codify moral behaviour which is a human social product developed by a process of biological and social evolution (associated with [[David Hume|Hume]]). Human rights are also described as a sociological pattern of rule setting (as in the sociological theory of law and the work of [[Max Weber|Weber]]). These approaches include the notion that individuals in a society accept rules from legitimate authority in exchange for security and economic advantage (as in [[John Rawls|Rawls]]) – a social contract. The two theories that dominate contemporary human rights discussion are the interest theory and the will theory. Interest theory argues that the principal function of human rights is to protect and promote certain essential human interests, while will theory attempts to establish the validity of human rights based on the unique human capacity for freedom.&lt;ref name="IEOP"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Fagan |2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other positions attempt to categorise rights into basic types, rather than make claims about the function or derivation of particular rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=Woody |title=Posthuman Rights: Dimensions of Transhuman Worlds |journal=Teknokultura |date=12 August 2015 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=373–384 |doi=10.5209/rev_TK.2015.v12.n2.49072 |url=https://philarchive.org/archive/EVAPRDv1 |accessdate=11 August 2018 |language=en |format=PDF |issn=1549-2230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
The claims made by human rights to universality have led to criticism. Philosophers who have criticised the concept of human rights include [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[Edmund Burke]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Karl Marx]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Canadian political philosophy professor Charles Blattberg argues that discussion of human rights, being abstract, demotivates people from upholding the values that rights are meant to affirm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last= Blattberg  |first= C  |year= 2010  |publisher= [[McGill-Queen's University Press]]  |chapter= The Ironic Tragedy of Human Rights  |isbn= 978-0-7735-3538-1  |title= Patriotic Elaborations: Essays in Practical Philosophy |pages=  43–59  |authorlink= Charles Blattberg |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8TwCsA–l408C&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] gives particular attention to two types of criticisms: the one questioning universality of human rights and the one denying them objective ground.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Fagan]] [http://www.iep.utm.edu/hum-rts/#H5 Philosophical criticisms of human rights] [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] Human Rights 2003-2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alain Pellet]], a French scholar on international law, criticises "human rightism" approach as denying the principle of sovereignty and claiming a special place for human rights among the branches of international law;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alain Pellet]] [http://www.droits-fondamentaux.org/spip.php?article27 "Droits-de-l’hommisme" et droit international] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117073042/http://www.droits-fondamentaux.org/spip.php?article27 |date=January 17, 2013 }} 2000 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; French journalist [[Alain de Benoist]] questions human rights premises of human equality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alain de Benoist]] [http://www.alaindebenoist.com/pdf/au-dela_des_droits_de_l_homme.pdf Au-dela des droits de l'homme]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317161306/http://www.alaindebenoist.com/pdf/au-dela_des_droits_de_l_homme.pdf |date=March 17, 2012 }} Krisis 2004{{fr icon}}; Religion of Human Rights, 1988 [http://www.velesova-sloboda.org/misc/benoist-die-religion-der-menschenrechte.html {{de icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505173723/http://velesova-sloboda.org/misc/benoist-die-religion-der-menschenrechte.html |date=May 5, 2012 }} [http://www.velesova-sloboda.org/polit/benoist-religiya-prav-cheloveka.html {{ru icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505201210/http://velesova-sloboda.org/polit/benoist-religiya-prav-cheloveka.html |date=May 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American scholar [[David Kennedy (jurist)|David Kennedy]] had listed pragmatic worries and polemical charges concerning human rights in 2002 in ''Harvard Human Rights Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=KENNEDY |first1=David|authorlink1=David Kennedy (jurist) |title=The International Human Rights Movements: Part of the Problem?’ |journal=Harvard Human Rights Journal |date= Spring 2002 |volume=15 |pages=101 |url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/hrj/iss15/kennedy.shtml#fn1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Human rights can be classified and organised in several different ways. At an international level the most common categorisation of human rights has been to split them into [[civil and political rights]], and [[economic, social and cultural rights]].

Civil and political rights are enshrined in articles 3 to 21 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] ([[ICCPR]]). Economic, social and cultural rights are enshrined in articles 22 to 28 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] ([[ICESCR]]).

===Indivisibility===
The [[UDHR]] included both economic, social and cultural rights and civil and political rights because it was based on the principle that the different rights could only successfully exist in combination:

{{Quote|The ideal of free human beings enjoying civil and political freedom and freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his civil and political rights, as well as his social, economic and cultural rights.|International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, 1966}}

This is held to be true because without civil and political rights the public cannot assert their economic, social and cultural rights. Similarly, without livelihoods and a working society, the public cannot assert or make use of civil or political rights (known as the ''full belly thesis'').

The indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights has been confirmed by the 1993 [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]]:

{{Quote|All human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and related. The international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the same emphasis.|[[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], [[World Conference on Human Rights]], 1993}}
This statement was again endorsed at the 2005 World Summit in New York (paragraph 121).

Although accepted by the signatories to the [[UDHR]], most do not in practice give equal weight to the different types of rights. Some Western cultures have often given priority to civil and political rights, sometimes at the expense of economic and social rights such as the [[right to work]], to [[right to education|education]], [[right to health|health]] and housing. Similarly the ex Soviet bloc countries and Asian countries have tended to give priority to economic, social and cultural rights, but have often failed to provide civil and political rights.

===Categorisation===
Opponents of the indivisibility of human rights argue that economic, social and cultural rights are fundamentally different from civil and political rights and require completely different approaches.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Economic, social and cultural rights are argued{{By whom|date=July 2014}} to be:
* ''aspirations or goals'', as opposed to real 'legal' rights
* ''ideologically divisive/political'', meaning that there is no consensus on what should or should not be provided as a right
* ''non-justiciable'', meaning that their provision, or the breach of them, cannot be judged in a court of law
* ''positive'', meaning that they require active provision of entitlements by the state (as opposed to the state being required only to prevent the breach of rights)
* ''progressive'', meaning that they will take significant time to implement
* ''resource-intensive'', meaning that they are expensive and difficult to provide
* ''[[socialism|socialist]]'', as opposed to [[capitalism|capitalist]]
* ''vague'', meaning they cannot be quantitatively measured, and whether they are adequately provided or not is difficult to judge.
Similarly civil and political rights are categorized as:
* ''capitalist''
* ''cost-free''
* ''immediate'', meaning they can be immediately provided if the state decides to
* ''justiciable''
* ''negative'', meaning the state can protect them simply by taking no action
* ''non-ideological/non-political''
* ''precise'', meaning their provision is easy to judge and measure
* ''real 'legal' rights''

Australian politician Olivia Ball and British scholar Paul Gready argue that for both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights, it is easy to find examples which do not fit into the above categorisation. Among several others, they highlight the fact that maintaining a judicial system, a fundamental requirement of the civil right to due process before the law and other rights relating to judicial process, is positive, resource-intensive, progressive and vague, while the social right to housing is precise, justiciable and can be a real 'legal' right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Ball |Gready |2006 |p=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three generations===
Another categorisation, offered by Czech-French scholar [[Karel Vasak]], is that there are ''[[three generations of human rights]]'': first-generation civil and political rights (right to life and political participation), second-generation economic, social and cultural rights (right to subsistence) and third-generation solidarity rights (right to peace, right to clean environment). Out of these generations, the third generation is the most debated and lacks both legal and political recognition. This categorisation is at odds with the indivisibility of rights, as it implicitly states that some rights can exist without others. Prioritisation of rights for pragmatic reasons is however a widely accepted necessity. American human rights scholar [[Philip Alston]] argues:

{{quote|If every possible human rights element is deemed to be essential or necessary, then nothing will be treated as though it is truly important.&lt;ref name="Alston807"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Alston |2005 |p=807 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He, and others, urge caution with prioritisation of rights:

{{quote|source=|[T]he call for prioritizing is not to suggest that any obvious violations of rights can be ignored.|Philip Alston&lt;ref name="Alston807"/&gt;}}

{{quote|Priorities, where necessary, should adhere to core concepts (such as reasonable attempts at progressive realization) and principles (such as non-discrimination, equality and participation.|Olivia Ball, Paul Gready&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Ball |Gready |2006 |p=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some human rights are said to be "[[inalienable rights]]". The term inalienable rights (or unalienable rights) refers to "a set of human rights that are fundamental, are not awarded by human power, and cannot be surrendered."

==International protection and promotion==
{{Main|International human rights law}}
In the aftermath of the atrocities of World War II, there was increased concern for the social and legal protection of human rights as fundamental freedoms. The foundation of the [[United Nations]] and the provisions of the United Nations Charter provided a basis for a comprehensive system of international law and practice for the protection of human rights. Since then, international human rights law has been characterised by a linked system of conventions, treaties, organisations, and political bodies, rather than any single entity or set of laws.&lt;ref name="Brownlie532"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Brownlie|2003|p=532 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, American analyst [[Pierre N. Leval|Pierre Leval]] suggested that respect for fundamental human rights in the world today (in 2013) is "dismal" within some nations:&lt;ref name=twsForeignAffairs/&gt;

{{Quote|Despotic regimes murder, mutilate, and rape civilian populations and arbitrarily imprison and torture political opponents. Human traffickers, almost invariably operating with the protection of corrupt local officials and police, enslave children and young women in the sex trade. So long as the regimes that sponsor and protect these criminals remain in power, their crimes go unrecognized.|[[Pierre N. Leval]] in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', 2013&lt;ref name=twsForeignAffairs&gt;Pierre N.

===United Nations Charter===
{{Main|United Nations Charter}}
The provisions of the United Nations Charter provided a basis for the development of international human rights protection in the opinion of British barrister [[Ian Brownlie]].&lt;ref name="Brownlie532" /&gt; The preamble of the charter provides that the members "reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the equal rights of men and women" and Article 1(3) of the United Nations charter states that one of the purposes of the UN is: "to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/chapter1.html] United Nations Charter Article 1(3).&lt;/ref&gt; Article 55 provides that:
{{quote|The United Nations shall promote: a) higher standards of living, full employment, and conditions of economic and social progress and development; b) solutions of international economic, social, health, and related problems; c) international cultural and educational cooperation; d) universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.}}
Of particular importance{{According to whom|date=May 2017}} is Article 56 of the charter: "All Members pledge themselves to take joint and separate action in co-operation with the Organization for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55." This is a binding treaty provision applicable to both the organization and its members and has been taken to constitute a legal obligation for the members of the United Nations.&lt;ref name="Brownlie532"/&gt; Overall, the references to human rights in the charter are general and vague. The charter does not contain specific legal rights, nor does it mandate any enforcement procedures to protect these rights.&lt;ref name="Shaw277"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Shaw |2008 |p=277 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Shaw, the importance of human rights on the global stage can be traced to the importance of human rights within the United Nations framework and the UN Charter can be seen as the starting point for the development of a broad array of declarations, treaties, implementation and enforcement mechanisms, UN organs, committees and reports on the protection of human rights.&lt;ref name="Shaw277"/&gt; The rights espoused in the UN charter were codified and defined in a non-binding context within the International Bill of Human Rights, composing the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].

===Universal Declaration of Human Rights===
{{Main|Universal Declaration of Human Rights}}
[[File:EleanorRooseveltHumanRights.png|right|thumb|upright=0.9|"It is not a [[treaty]]...[In the future, it] may well become the international [[Magna Carta]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Roosevelt |1948 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Eleanor Roosevelt]] with the Spanish text of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Universal Declaration]] in 1949.]]
The '''Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)''' was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly&lt;ref name="UDHR"/&gt; in 1948, partly in response to the atrocities of [[World War II]]. It is generally viewed as the preeminent statement of international rights and has been identified as being a culmination of centuries of thinking along both secular and religious lines.&lt;ref name=twsIshay&gt;The History of Human Rights: From Ancient Times to the Globalization Era, [[Micheline R.

The declaration was the first international legal effort to limit the behaviour of states and press upon them duties to their citizens.

{{quote|...recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and [[inalienable rights]] of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.|Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948}}

The UDHR was framed by members of the Human Rights Commission, with former [[First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] as Chair, who began to discuss an ''International Bill of Rights'' in 1947. The members of the Commission did not immediately agree on the form of such a bill of rights, and whether, or how, it should be enforced. The Commission proceeded to frame the UDHR and accompanying treaties, but the UDHR quickly became the priority.&lt;ref name=Glendon&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Glendon |2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Canadian law professor [[John Peters Humphrey|John Humphrey]] and French lawyer [[René Cassin]] were responsible for much of the cross-national research and the structure of the document respectively, where the articles of the declaration were interpretative of the general principle of the preamble. The document was structured by Cassin to include the basic principles of dignity, liberty, equality and brotherhood in the first two articles, followed successively by rights pertaining to individuals; rights of individuals in relation to each other and to groups; spiritual, public and political rights; and economic, social and cultural rights. According to Cassin, the final three articles place rights in the context of limits, duties and the social and political order in which they are to be realised.&lt;ref name=Glendon/&gt;
Humphrey and Cassin intended the rights in the UDHR to be legally enforceable through some means, as is reflected in the third clause of the preamble:&lt;ref name=Glendon/&gt;

{{quote|Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law.|Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948}}

Some of the UDHR was researched and written by a committee of international experts on human rights, including representatives from all continents and all major religions, and drawing on consultation with leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;Glendon (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The inclusion of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights&lt;ref name=Glendon/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gready34"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Ball |Gready |2006 |p=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was predicated on the assumption that all human rights are indivisible and that the different types of rights listed are inextricably linked. This principle was not then opposed by any member states (the declaration was adopted unanimously, [[Byelorussian SSR]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Poland]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Ukrainian SSR]], [[Union of South Africa]], [[USSR]], [[Yugoslavia]].); however, this principle was later subject to significant challenges.&lt;ref name="Gready34"/&gt;

The Universal Declaration was bifurcated into treaties, a Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and another on social, economic, and cultural rights, due to questions about the relevance and propriety of economic and social provisions in covenants on human rights. Both covenants begin with the right of people to self-determination and to sovereignty over their natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;Henkin, Louis. The International Bill of Rights: The Universal Declaration and the Covenants, in International Enforcement of Human Rights 6–9, Bernhardt and Jolowicz, eds, (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; This debate over whether human rights are more fundamental than economic rights has continued to the present day. The United States declared after the World Food Summit that a right to be free from hunger does not give rise to any international obligations which has been interpreted as a [[negative duty]].&lt;ref name=ohch&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pogge|first1=Thomas|title=Poverty and Human Rights|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/poverty/expert/docs/Thomas_Pogge_Summary.pdf|website=ohchr.org|accessdate=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drafters of the Covenants initially intended only one instrument. The original drafts included only political and civil rights, but economic and social rights were also proposed. The disagreement over which rights were basic human rights resulted in there being two covenants. The debate was whether economic and social rights are aspirational, as contrasted with basic human rights which all people possess purely by being human, because economic and social rights depend on wealth and the availability of resources. In addition, which social and economic rights should be recognised depends on ideology or economic theories, in contrast to basic human rights, which are defined purely by the nature (mental and physical abilities) of human beings. It was debated whether economic rights were appropriate subjects for binding obligations and whether the lack of consensus over such rights would dilute the strength of political-civil rights. There was wide agreement and clear recognition that the means required to enforce or induce compliance with socioeconomic undertakings were different from the means required for civil-political rights.&lt;ref&gt;Henkin, Louis. Introduction, The International Bill of Rights 9–10 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Henkin |first1=Louis|title=The International Bill of Rights: The Covenant on Civil and Political Rights |date=1981|publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780231051804|pages=9–10 |edition= |url=https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/789034 |accessdate=11 August 2018 |language=en |chapter= Introduction|hdl=10822/789034|oclc= 802896468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This debate and the desire for the greatest number of signatories to human-rights law led to the two covenants. The Soviet bloc and a number of developing countries had argued for the inclusion of all rights in a so-called ''Unity Resolution''. Both covenants allowed states to derogate some rights.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Those in favour of a single treaty could not gain sufficient consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Ball |Gready |2006 |p=35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===International treaties===
In 1966, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] ('''ICCPR''') and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] ('''ICESCR''') were adopted by the [[United Nations]], between them making the rights contained in the UDHR binding on all states that have signed this treaty, creating human-rights law.

Since then numerous other treaties ([[International human rights instruments|pieces of legislation]]) have been offered at the international level. They are generally known as ''human rights instruments''. Some of the most significant, referred to (with ICCPR and ICESCR) as "the seven core treaties", are:
* [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] ('''CEDAW''') (adopted 1979, entry into force: 1981)
* [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] ('''CERD''') (adopted 1966, entry into force: 1969)
* [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] ('''CRPD''') (adopted 2006, entry into force: 2008)
* [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] ('''CRC''') (adopted 1989, entry into force: 1989)
* [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] ('''CAT''') (adopted 1984, entry into force: 1987)
* [[United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families|International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families]] ('''ICRMW''' or more often '''MWC''') (adopted 1990, entry into force: 2003)

===Customary international law===
{{Main|Customary international law}}
In addition to protection by international treaties, customary international law may protect some human rights, such as the prohibition of torture, genocide and slavery and the principle of non-discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Shaw |2008 |p=275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International humanitarian law===
{{Main|Geneva Conventions|International humanitarian law}}

The '''Geneva Conventions''' came into being between 1864 and 1949 as a result of efforts by [[Henry Dunant]], the founder of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]. The conventions safeguard the human rights of individuals involved in armed conflict, and build on the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]], the international community's first attempt to formalise the laws of war and war crimes in the nascent body of secular international law. The conventions were revised as a result of World War II and readopted by the international community in 1949.

Under the mandate of the UN charter, and the multilateral UN human rights treaties, the United Nations (UN) as an intergovernmental body seeks to apply international [[jurisdiction]] for universal human-rights legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Ball |Gready |2006 |p=92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the UN machinery, human-rights issues are primarily the concern of the [[United Nations Security Council]] and the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], and there are numerous committees within the UN with responsibilities for safeguarding different human-rights treaties. The most senior body of the UN in the sphere of human rights is the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The United Nations has an international mandate to:

{{quote|achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, gender, language, or religion.|Article 1–3 of the [[United Nations Charter]]}}

====Political bodies====

=====Security Council=====
{{Main|United Nations Security Council}}
The '''United Nations Security Council''' has the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security and is the only body of the UN that can authorise the use of force. It has been criticised for failing to take action to prevent human rights abuses, including the [[War in Darfur|Darfur crisis]], the [[Srebrenica massacre]] and the [[Rwandan Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;Fred Grünfeld and Anke Huijboom, ''The failure to prevent genocide in Rwanda: the role of bystanders'' (2007) p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; For example, critics blamed the presence of non-democracies on the Security Council for its failure regarding.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Feinstein, ''Darfur and beyond: what is needed to prevent mass atrocities'' (2007) p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 2006 the Security Council adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1674|resolution 1674]] that reaffirmed the responsibility to protect populations from [[genocide]], [[war crime]]s, [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]]" and committed the Security Council to action to protect civilians in armed conflict.&lt;ref name="Oxfam_28April"&gt;[http://www.oxfam.org/en/news/pressreleases2006/pr060428_un Security Council passes landmark resolution – world has responsibility to protect people from genocide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012101425/http://www.oxfam.org/en/news/pressreleases2006/pr060428_un |date=October 12, 2010 }} [[Oxfam]] Press Release - April 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=====General Assembly=====
[[File:UN General Assembly hall.jpg|thumb|The [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]]]]
{{Main|United Nations General Assembly}}
The '''United Nations General Assembly''', under Article 13 of the UN Charter, has the power to initiate studies and make recommendations on human rights issues.&lt;ref name="Sepúlveda et al. 2004 80"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Sepúlveda et al. |2004 |p=80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under this provision, the general assembly passed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, and since then a wide variety of other human rights instruments.&lt;ref name="Sepúlveda et al. 2004 80"/&gt; The assembly has several subsidiary organs that deal with specific human rights issues, such as the Special Committee on Decolonisation and the Special Commission against Apartheid (no longer operational). In addition the general assembly has set up a number of subsidiary organs that consider human rights issues in a number of high-profile contexts: such as the UN Council on Namibia, the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practises in the Occupied territories and the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable rights of the Palestine People.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Shaw |2008 |p=303 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Human Rights Council=====
{{Main|United Nations Human Rights Council}}

The '''United Nations Human Rights Council''', created at the [[2005 World Summit]] to replace the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]], has a mandate to investigate violations of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The Human Rights Council is a subsidiary body of the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reports directly to it. It ranks below the Security Council, which is the final authority for the interpretation of the [[United Nations Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;UN Charter, Article 39&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-seven of the one hundred ninety-one member states sit on the council, elected by simple majority in a secret ballot of the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. Members serve a maximum of six years and may have their membership suspended for gross human rights abuses. The Council is based in [[Geneva]], and meets three times a year; with additional meetings to respond to urgent situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Ball |Gready |2006 |p=95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent experts (''rapporteurs'') are retained by the Council to investigate alleged human rights abuses and to provide the Council with reports.

The Human Rights Council may request that the Security Council take action when human rights violations occur. This action may be direct actions, may involve [[International sanctions|sanctions]], and the Security Council may also refer cases to the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) even if the issue being referred is outside the normal jurisdiction of the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;The Security Council referred the human rights situation in [[Darfur]] in [[Sudan]] to the ICC despite the fact that Sudan has a functioning legal system&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treaty bodies====
{{anchor|Treaty bodies}}&lt;!-- [[Human rights treaty bodies]] redirects here --&gt;
In addition to the political bodies whose mandate flows from the UN charter, the UN has set up a number of ''treaty-based'' bodies, comprising committees of independent experts who monitor compliance with human rights standards and norms flowing from the core international human rights treaties. They are supported by and are created by the treaty that they monitor, With the exception of the CESCR, which was established under a resolution of the Economic and Social Council to carry out the monitoring functions originally assigned to that body under the Covenant, they are technically autonomous bodies, established by the treaties that they monitor and accountable to the state parties of those treaties - rather than subsidiary to the United Nations. Though in practice they are closely intertwined with the United Nations system and are supported by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (UNHCHR) and the UN Centre for Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Shaw |2008 |p=311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[Human Rights Committee]]'' promotes participation with the standards of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]]. The members of the committee express opinions on member countries and make judgments on individual complaints against countries which have ratified an Optional Protocol to the treaty. The judgments, termed "views", are not legally binding. The member of the committee meets around  three times a year to hold sessions &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CCPR/Pages/CCPRIntro.aspx|title=OHCHR {{!}} Introduction of the Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]'' monitors the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]] and makes general comments on ratifying countries performance. It will have the power to receive complaints against the countries that opted into the Optional Protocol once it has come into force. It is important to note that unlike the other treaty bodies, the economic committee is not an autonomous body responsible to the treaty parties, but directly responsible to the Economic and Social Council and ultimately to the General Assembly. This means that the Economic Committee faces particular difficulties at its disposal only relatively "weak" means of implementation in comparison to other treaty bodies.&lt;ref name=Shaw309&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Shaw |2008 |p=309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Particular difficulties noted by commentators include: perceived vagueness of the principles of the treaty, relative lack of legal texts and decisions, ambivalence of many states in addressing economic, social and cultural rights, comparatively few non-governmental organisations focused on the area and problems with obtaining relevant and precise information.&lt;ref name=Shaw309/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* The ''Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination'' monitors the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|CERD]] and conducts regular reviews of countries' performance. It can make judgments on complaints against member states allowing it, but these are not legally binding. It issues warnings to attempt to prevent serious contraventions of the convention.
* The ''Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women'' monitors the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]]. It receives states' reports on their performance and comments on them, and can make judgments on complaints against countries which have opted into the 1999 Optional Protocol.
* The ''Committee Against Torture'' monitors the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|CAT]] and receives states' reports on their performance every four years and comments on them. Its subcommittee may visit and inspect countries which have opted into the Optional Protocol.
* The ''[[Committee on the Rights of the Child]]'' monitors the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|CRC]] and makes comments on reports submitted by states every five years. It does not have the power to receive complaints.
* The ''Committee on Migrant Workers'' was established in 2004 and monitors the [[United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families|ICRMW]] and makes comments on reports submitted by states every five years. It will have the power to receive complaints of specific violations only once ten member states allow it.
* The ''[[Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]'' was established in 2008 to monitor the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]. It has the power to receive complaints against the countries which have opted into the [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]].
* The ''Committee on Enforced Disappearances'' monitors the [[International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance|ICPPED]]. All States parties are obliged to submit reports to the Committee on how the rights are being implemented. The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the State party in the form of "concluding observations”.

Each treaty body receives secretariat support from the Human Rights Council and Treaties Division of Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) in Geneva except CEDAW, which is supported by the Division for the Advancement of Women (DAW). CEDAW formerly held all its sessions at United Nations headquarters in New York but now frequently meets at the United Nations Office in Geneva; the other treaty bodies meet in Geneva. The Human Rights Committee usually holds its March session in New York City.

===Regional human rights regimes===
{{Main|Regional human rights regimes}}
International human rights regimes are in several cases "nested" within more comprehensive and overlapping regional agreements. These regional regimes can be seen as relatively independently coherent human rights sub-regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Donnelly |2003 |p=138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three principal regional human rights instruments can be identified; the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]], the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] (the Americas) and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The European Convention on Human Rights has since 1950 defined and guaranteed human rights and fundamental freedoms in Europe.&lt;ref name=EUCourt&gt;{{cite web

{{Main|Non-governmental organization}}
International '''non-governmental human rights organisations''' such as [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[International Service for Human Rights]] and [[International Federation of Human Rights|FIDH]] monitor what they see as human rights issues around the world and promote their views on the subject. Human rights organisations have been said to "translate complex international issues into activities to be undertaken by concerned citizens in their own community".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Human rights organisations frequently engage in [[lobbying]] and [[advocacy]] in an effort to convince the United Nations, supranational bodies and national governments to adopt their policies on human rights. Many human-rights organisations have observer status at the various UN bodies tasked with protecting human rights. A new (in 2009) non-governmental human-rights conference is the [[Oslo Freedom Forum]], a gathering described by [[The Economist]] as "on its way to becoming a human-rights equivalent of the Davos economic forum." The same article noted that human-rights advocates are more and more divided amongst themselves over how violations of human rights are to be defined, notably as regards the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

There is criticism of human-rights organisations who use their status but allegedly move away from their stated goals. For example, [[Gerald M. Steinberg]], an Israel-based academic, maintains that NGOs take advantage of a "[[halo effect]]" and are "given the status of impartial moral watchdogs" by governments and the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Human rights defenders===

Human rights defender are people who, individually or with others, act peacefully to promote or protect human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ishr.ch/news/un-declaration-human-rights-defenders|title=UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders|work=ISHR|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can defend rights as part of their jobs or in a voluntary capacity and can act at local, national or international level. They can be journalists, environmentalists, whistle-blowers, trade unionists, lawyers, teachers, housing campaigners, and so on. As a result of their activities, they can sometimes be the subject of reprisals and attacks of all kinds, including smears, surveillance, harassment, false charges, arbitrary detention, restrictions on the right to freedom of association, and physical attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act30/6011/2017/en/|title=Human Rights Defenders under threat|last=Amnesty International|first=|date=2017|website=amnesty.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the legal and moral environment surrounding the actions of governments is reasonably well developed, that surrounding multinational companies is both controversial and ill-defined.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Multinational companies' primary responsibility is to their [[shareholder]]s, not to those affected by their actions. Such companies may be larger than the economies of some of the states within which they operate, and can wield significant economic and political power. No international treaties exist to specifically cover the behaviour of companies with regard to human rights, and national legislation is very variable.

==Violations==
{{See also|War|Genocides in history|Human rights defender|Corporate accountability for human rights violations}}
{{category see also|Human rights abuses}}

'''Human rights violations''' occur when actions by state (or non-state) actors abuse, ignore, or deny basic human rights (including civil, political, cultural, social, and economic rights). Furthermore, violations of human rights can occur when any state or non-state actor breaches any part of the UDHR treaty or other international human rights or humanitarian law.&lt;ref&gt;There is an ongoing debate on the relationship between the two branches of law. 
* {{cite journal|last1=Koskenniemi|first1=Marti|title=Fragmentation of International Law?

&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to human rights violations of [[United Nations]] laws, Article 39 of the [[United Nations Charter]] designates the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] (or an appointed authority) as the only tribunal that may determine UN human rights violations.

Human rights abuses are monitored by United Nations committees, national institutions and governments and by many independent [[non-governmental organisations]], such as [[Amnesty International]], [[International Federation of Human Rights]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[World Organisation Against Torture]], [[Freedom House]], [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]] and [[Anti-Slavery International]]. These organisations collect evidence and documentation of alleged human rights abuses and apply pressure to enforce human rights laws.

[[Wars of aggression]], [[war crime]]s and [[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]], including [[genocide]], are breaches of [[International humanitarian law]] and represent the most serious of human rights violations.

In efforts to eliminate violations of human rights, building awareness and protesting inhumane treatment has often led to calls for action and sometimes improved conditions. The UN Security Council has interceded with peace keeping forces, and other states and treaties (NATO) have intervened in situations to protect human rights.

==Substantive rights==
{{see also|Substantive rights}}

===Right to life===
{{Main|Right to life}}
{{quote|Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.|Article 6.1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights}}
The right to life is the essential right that a human being has the right not to be killed by another human being. The [[concept]] of a right to life is central to debates on the issues of [[abortion]], [[capital punishment]], [[euthanasia]], [[Self-defense (theory)|self defence]] and [[Just War|war]]. According to many human rights activists, the [[death penalty]] violates this right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty |title=Abolish the death penalty |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[United Nations]] has called on states retaining the death penalty to establish a moratorium on capital punishment with a view to its abolition.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations resolution 62/149.&lt;/ref&gt; States which do not do so face considerable moral and political pressure.

===Freedom from torture===
{{Main|Torture}}

Throughout history, torture has been used as a method of political [[Mind control|re-education]], interrogation, punishment, and coercion. In addition to state-sponsored torture, individuals or groups may be motivated to inflict torture on others for similar reasons to those of a state; however, the motive for torture can also be for the [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] gratification of the torturer, as in the [[Moors murders]].

Since the mid-20th century, torture is prohibited under [[international law]] and the domestic laws of most countries. It is considered to be a violation of human rights, and is declared to be unacceptable by Article 5 of the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Signatories of the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Conventions of 1949]] and the [[Protocol I|Additional Protocols I]] and [[Protocol II|II]] of June 8, 1977 officially agree not to torture captured persons in [[armed conflicts]], whether international or internal. Torture is also prohibited by the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]], which has been ratified by 157 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Freedom of speech===
{{Main|Freedom of speech}}
Freedom of speech is the freedom to speak freely without censorship. The term freedom of expression is sometimes used synonymously, but includes any act of seeking, receiving and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the medium used. In practice, the right to freedom of speech is not absolute in any country and the right is commonly subject to limitations, such as on libel, slander, obscenity, blasphemy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Laws Penalizing Blasphemy, Apostasy and Defamation of Religion are Widespread |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/11/21/laws-penalizing-blasphemy-apostasy-and-defamation-of-religion-are-widespread/ |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=Pew Research Center |date=21 November 2012 |quote=s of 2011 nearly half of the countries and territories in the world (47%) have laws or policies that penalize blasphemy, apostasy (abandoning one’s faith) or defamation (disparagement or criticism of particular religions or religion in general). Of the 198 countries studied, 32 (16%) have anti-blasphemy laws, 20 (10%) have laws penalizing apostasy and 87 (44%) have laws against the defamation of religion, including hate speech against members of religious groups.}}&lt;/ref&gt; incitement to commit a crime, etc.
The right to freedom of expression is recognised as a human right under Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and recognised in international human rights law in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Article 19 of the ICCPR states that "[e]veryone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference" and "everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice".

===Freedom of thought, conscience and religion===
{{Main|Freedom of thought|Conscience|Freedom of religion}}

{{quote|Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.|Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights}}
Freedom of thought, conscience and religion are closely related rights that protect the [[Political freedom|freedom]] of an individual or community, in public or private, to think and freely hold conscientious beliefs and to manifest [[religion]] or [[belief]] in [[religious education|teaching]], practice, [[worship]], and observance; the concept is generally recognised also to include the freedom to [[Religious conversion|change religion]] or [[Irreligion by country|not to follow any religion]].&lt;ref&gt;
[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], Article 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The freedom to ''leave'' or discontinue membership in a religion or religious group—in religious terms called "[[apostasy]]"—is also a fundamental part of religious freedom, covered by Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights |publisher=The United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights groups such as [[Amnesty International]] organises campaigns to protect those arrested and or incarcerated as a [[prisoner of conscience]] because of their conscientious beliefs, particularly concerning intellectual, political and artistic freedom of expression and association.&lt;ref&gt;For example see Jan Brabec, Václav Havel, Ivan Lamper, David Nemec, Petr Placak, Joska Skalnik ''et al.'' [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/4151 "Prisoners of Conscience"]. ''New York Review of Books''. 1989; 36 (1) February 2. Accessed October 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In legislation, a [[conscience clause (medical)|conscience clause]] is a provision in a statute that excuses a health professional from complying with the law (for example legalising surgical or pharmaceutical [[abortion]]) if it is incompatible with religious or conscientious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=White |first1=Katherine A. |title=Crisis of Conscience: Reconciling Religious Health Care Providers' Beliefs and Patients' Rights |journal=Stanford Law Review |date=1999 |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=1703–1749 |doi=10.2307/1229534 |pmid=10558539|url=https://heinonline.org/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/stflr51&amp;section=62 |accessdate=11 August 2018 |jstor=1229534 |hdl=10822/925276 |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom of movement===
{{Main|Freedom of movement}}

Freedom of movement asserts that a citizen of a state in which that citizen is present has the liberty to travel, reside in, and/or work in any part of the state where one pleases within the limits of respect for the liberty and rights of others,&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;Jérémiee Gilbert, ''Nomadic Peoples and Human Rights'' (2014), p. 73: "Freedom of movement within a country encompasses both the right to travel freely within the territory of the State and the right to relocate oneself and to choose one's place of residence".&lt;/ref&gt; and to leave that state and return at any time.

===Rights debates===
Events and new possibilities can affect existing rights or require new ones. Advances of technology, medicine, and philosophy constantly challenge the [[status quo]] of human rights thinking.

'''Right to education'''

UN agencies, such as UNESCO, promote the right to education as a fundamental right. Education encompasses several thematic areas, including comprehensive sexuality education, which is also considered to be relevant for human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: An evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Right to keep and bear arms====

====Future generations====
In 1997, [[UNESCO]] adopted the ''Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generation Towards the Future Generation''. The Declaration opens with the words:

{{quote|Mindful of the will of the peoples, set out solemnly in the [[Charter of the United Nations]], to 'save succeeding generations from the scourge of war' and to safeguard the values and principles enshrined in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], and all other relevant instruments of international law.|Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generation Towards the Future Generation}}

Article 1 of the declaration states "the present generations have the responsibility of ensuring that the needs and interests of present and future generations are fully safeguarded". The preamble to the declaration states that "at this point in history, the very existence of humankind and its environment are threatened" and the declaration covers a variety of issues including protection of the [[Natural environment|environment]], the [[human genome]], [[biodiversity]], cultural heritage, [[peace]], development, and [[education]]. The preamble recalls that the responsibilities of the present generations towards future generations has been referred to in various international instruments, including the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (UNESCO 1972), the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] and the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (Rio de Janeiro, 1992), the [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]] (UN Conference on Environment and Development, 1992), the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] (World Conference on Human Rights, 1993) and a number of UN General Assembly resolutions relating to the protection of the global climate for present and future generations adopted since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13178&amp;URL_DO=DO_PRINTPAGE&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generation Towards the Future Generation |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual orientation and gender identity rights relate to the expression of [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] based on the right to respect for private life and the right not to be discriminated against on the ground of "other status" as defined in various human rights conventions, such as article 17 and 26 in the United Nations [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|article 8]] and [[European Convention on Human Rights#Article 14 - discrimination|article 14]] in the European Convention on Human Rights.

A global charter for sexual orientation and gender identity rights has been proposed in the form of the '[[Yogyakarta Principles]]', a set of 29 principles whose authors say they apply [[International Human Rights Law]] statutes and precedent to situations relevant to LGBT people's experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The principles were presented at a [[United Nations]] event in New York on November 7, 2007, co-sponsored by [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Uruguay]].

The principles have been acknowledged with influencing the French proposed [[Sexual orientation and gender identity at the United Nations|UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity]], which focuses on ending violence, criminalisation and capital punishment and does not include dialogue about same-sex marriage or right to start a family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franceonu.org/spip.php?article4092 |title=Sexual orientation and gender identity |publisher=France Onu |accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Trade====
Although both the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] emphasise the importance of a right to work, neither of these documents explicitly mention free trade as a mechanism for ensuring this fundamental right. And yet trade plays a key role in providing jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some experts argue that trade is inherent to human nature and that when governments inhibit international trade they directly inhibit the right to work and the other indirect benefits, like the right to education, that increased work and investment help accrue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Others have argued that the ability to trade does not affect everyone equally—often groups like the rural poor, indigenous groups and women are less likely to access the benefits of increased trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On the other hand, others think that it is no longer primarily individuals but companies that trade, and therefore it cannot be guaranteed as a human right.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Additionally, trying to fit too many concepts under the umbrella of what qualifies as a human right has the potential to dilute their importance. Finally, it is difficult to define a right to trade as either "fair"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Water and sanitation====
{{Main|Human right to water and sanitation}}
{{See also|Water politics}}

The right to water has been recognised in a wide range of international documents, including treaties, declarations and other standards. For instance, the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ([[CEDAW]]) requires State parties to ensure to women the right to "enjoy adequate living conditions, particularly in relation to … water supply". The 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) requires States parties to combat disease and malnutrition "through the provision of adequate nutritious foods and clean drinking-water".

The most clear definition of the human right to water has been issued by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This treaty body interpreting legal obligations of State parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ([[ICESCR]]) issued in 2002 a non-binding interpretation affirming that access to water was a condition for the enjoyment of the [[right to an adequate standard of living]] and inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of health (see ICESCR Art. 11 &amp; 12) and therefore a human right:

{{quote|The human right to water entitles everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic uses.|United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights}}

On July 28, 2010, the United Nations General Assembly declared water and [[sanitation]] as human rights. Since then, all States have at least ratified one human rights convention which explicitly or implicitly recognises the right, and they all have signed at least one political declaration recognising this right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/human_right_to_water.shtml|title=International Decade for Action 'Water for Life' 2005-2015.

Human rights include women's rights and sexual and reproductive rights. Sexual and reproductive rights are part of a continuum of human rights, which includes the rights to life, health and education, the rights to equality and non-discrimination, and the right to decide the timing, number and spacing of one's children.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/human-rights|title=Human rights - UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|website=www.unfpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="COOK"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Cook|first1= Rebecca J. |last2= Fathalla |first2= Mahmoud F.|date=September 1996|title= Advancing Reproductive Rights Beyond Cairo and Beijing|journal= International Family Planning Perspectives|volume= 22|issue= 3|pages= 115–121|doi= 10.2307/2950752|jstor= 2950752|ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive and sexual rights as part of human rights was affirmed internationally at the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo in 1994.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt; It was the first among international development frameworks to address issues related to sexuality, sexual and reproductive health, and reproductive rights.&lt;ref name="Commitment"&gt;{{cite web|title=FROM COMMITMENT TO ACTION ON SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND RIGHTS|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/Final_UNFPA-UPR-ASSESSMENT_270814..pdf|publisher=[[United Nations Population Fund|UNFPA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICPD Programme of Action in paragraph 7.2 "defines an individual's sexual and reproductive health as complete well-being related to sexual activity and reproduction. Sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) encompass both entitlements and freedoms. This includes the definition of reproductive rights in paragraph 7.3 of the ICPD PoA, which clarifies that these are not a new set of rights but human rights in existing human rights instruments related to sexual and reproductive autonomy and the attainment of sexual and reproductive health.&lt;ref name="Reproductive rights"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reproductive Rights are Human Rights|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/NHRIHandbook.pdf|publisher=[[United Nations Population Fund|UNFPA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action (PfA) expands this definition to cover both sexuality and reproduction by affirming in paragraph 96 the right to exercise control over and make decisions about one’s sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence."&lt;ref name="Commitment"/&gt;

Reproductive rights were first established as a subset of human rights at the United Nations 1968 International Conference on Human Rights.&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN" /&gt; The sixteenth article of the resulting Proclamation of Teheran states, "Parents have a basic human right to determine [[Freedom of will|freely]] and [[Moral responsibility|responsibly]] the number and the spacing of their children."&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"&gt;{{cite journal

Reproductive rights may also be understood to include [[sex education|education]] about [[contraception]] and [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]], and freedom from [[coerced sterilisation]] and contraception, protection from gender-based practices such as [[female genital cutting]] (FGC) and [[male genital mutilation]] (MGM).&lt;ref name="COOK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AMNESTY"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Information and communication technologies====
{{Main|Right to Internet access |Digital rights}}

In October 2009, [[Finland]]'s [[Ministry of Transport and Communications (Finland)|Ministry of Transport and Communications]] announced that every person in Finland would have the legal right to Internet access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 |url= http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/news/2009/10/1mb_broadband_access_becomes_legal_right_1080940.html

 |work= YLE |location =Helsinki
 |date= October 14, 2009
 |accessdate= December 15, 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since July 2010, the government has legally obligated [[telecommunications companies]] to offer broadband Internet access to every permanent residence and office. The connection must be "reasonably priced" and have a downstream rate of at least 1 Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

 |title= First nation makes broadband access a legal right
 |publisher= CNN
 |date= July 12, 2010
 |accessdate= December 15, 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, the [[BBC]], having commissioned an [[opinion poll]], reported that "almost four in five people around the world believe that access to the internet is a fundamental right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poll, conducted by the polling company [[GlobeScan]] for the [[BBC World Service]], collated the answers of 27,973 adult citizens across 26 countries to find that 79% of adults either strongly agreed or somewhat agreed with the statement: "access to the internet should be a fundamental right of all people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==== Right to non-refoulement vs. right to asylum ====
Non-refoulement is the right not to be returned to a place of persecution and is the foundation for international refugee law, as outlined in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Convention relating to the Status of Refugees|url = http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/StatusOfRefugees.aspx|website = www.ohchr.org|accessdate = September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the right to non-refoulement and the right to asylum have taken centre stage in recent debates over the treatment of refugees. A central worry about the right to asylum is that it can limit a state's power to handle a mass influx of refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Frontier Justice: The Global Refugee Crisis and What To Do About It|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Frontier_Justice.html?id=VRSQQO-O0u0C|publisher = Doubleday Canada|date = April 5, 2011|isbn = 9780307367921|first = Andy|last = Lamey|pages = 141–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Processing asylum applications can take a considerable amount of time, and this amount rises with the number of refugees applying. This creates an incentive for more refugees to apply, since they are allowed to stay in the country during the application process. One potential solution to the problem of mass influx is proposed by U.S.-based political philosopher Andy Lamey. Lamey proposes a portable procedural model that focuses on the right to non-refoulement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Frontier Justice: The Global Refugee Crisis and What To Do About It|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Frontier_Justice.html?id=VRSQQO-O0u0C|publisher = Doubleday Canada|date = April 5, 2011|isbn = 9780307367921|first = Andy|last = Lamey|pages = 232–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crucially, the procedural rights defended by this model can be applied outside national borders, within any rights respecting country; this allows the burden of mass influx to be shared by a plurality of countries without violating the procedural rights of the refugee.

==Relationship with other topics==

===The environment===
There are two basic conceptions of environmental human rights in the current human rights system. The first is that the right to a healthy or adequate environment is itself a human right (as seen in both Article 24 of the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]], and Article 11 of the San Salvador Protocol to the [[American Convention on Human Rights]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title= OAS – Organization of American States: Democracy for peace, security, and development
 |publisher= Oas.org
 |accessdate= August 29, 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The second conception is the idea that environmental human rights can be derived from other human rights, usually – the right to life, the right to health, the right to private family life and the right to property (among many others). This second theory enjoys much more widespread use in human rights courts around the world, as those rights are contained in many human rights documents.

The onset of various [[List of environmental issues|environmental issues]], especially [[climate change]], has created potential conflicts between different human rights. Human rights ultimately require a working ecosystem and healthy environment, but the granting of certain rights to individuals may damage these. Such as the conflict between right to decide number of offspring and the common need for a healthy environment, as noted in the [[tragedy of the commons]].&lt;ref name="hardin68"&gt;Garrett Hardin, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/162/3859/1243 "The Tragedy of the Commons"], ''Science'', Vol. 162, No. 3859 (December 13, 1968), pp. 1243–1248. Also available here [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/162/3859/1243.pdf] and [http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html here.]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the area of environmental rights, the responsibilities of multinational corporations, so far relatively unaddressed by human rights legislation, is of paramount consideration.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

[[Environmental rights]] revolve largely around the idea of a right to a livable environment both for the present and the future generations.

===National security===
{{See also|National security|Anti-terrorism legislation}}

With the exception of non-derogable human rights (international conventions class the right to life, the right to be free from slavery, the right to be free from torture and the right to be free from retroactive application of penal laws as non-derogable),&lt;ref name=resourceII&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the UN recognises that human rights can be limited or even pushed aside during times of national emergency – although

{{quote|the emergency must be actual, affect the whole population and the threat must be to the very existence of the nation. The declaration of emergency must also be a last resort and a temporary measure.|United Nations. ''The Resource''&lt;ref name=resourceII/&gt;}}

Rights that cannot be derogated for reasons of national security in any circumstances are known as [[Peremptory norm|peremptory norms or ''jus cogens'']]. Such [[United Nations Charter]] obligations are binding on all states and cannot be modified by treaty.

Examples of national security being used to justify human rights violations include the [[Japanese American internment]] during [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Relativism and universalism===
{{Main|Cultural relativism|Moral relativism|Moral universalism}}
[[File:White mans burden the journal detroit.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Relativists argue that human rights must avoid pushing the values of a single culture at the expense of others. "[[The White Man's Burden]]" is seen as an example of the West using the spread of Western culture as a justification for colonisation.]]
[[File:Fgm map.gif|right|thumb|upright=0.9|Universalists argue that some practices violate the norms of all human cultures. They point out that although [[Female genital mutilation]] is prevalent in Africa, no religion supports the practice, and the tradition is in violation of women's rights.]]

The UDHR enshrines universal rights that apply to all humans equally, whichever geographical location, state, race or culture they belong to. However, in academia there is a dispute between scholars that advocate [[moral relativism]] and scholars that advocate [[moral universalism]]. Relativists do not argue against human rights, but concede that human rights are [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]] and are shaped by cultural and environmental contexts. Universalists argue that human rights have always existed, and apply to all people regardless of culture, race, sex, or religion.

More specifically, proponents of cultural relativism argue for acceptance of different cultures, which may have practices conflicting with human rights. Relativists caution that universalism could be used as a form of cultural, economic or political imperialism. [[The White Man's Burden]] is used as an example of imperialism and the destruction of local cultures justified by the desire to spread [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] values.&lt;ref&gt;"Eurocentrism". In ''Encyclopedia of the Developing World''. Ed. Thomas M. Leonard, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2006, {{ISBN|0-415-97662-6}}, p. 636.&lt;/ref&gt;
In particular, the concept of human rights is often claimed to be fundamentally rooted in a politically [[liberalism|liberal]] outlook which, although generally accepted in Europe, [[human rights in Japan|Japan]] or North America, is not necessarily taken as standard elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Opponents of relativism argue that some practices exist that violate the norms of all human cultures. A common example is [[female genital mutilation]], which occurs in different cultures in Africa, Asia and South America.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} It is not mandated by any religion, but has become a tradition in many cultures. It is considered a violation of women's and girl's rights by much of the international community, and is outlawed in some countries.

The former Prime Ministers of [[Singapore]], [[Lee Kuan Yew]], and of [[Malaysia]], [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] both claimed in the 1990s that ''[[Asian values]]'' were significantly different from Western values and included a sense of loyalty and foregoing personal freedoms for the sake of social stability and prosperity, and therefore authoritarian government is more appropriate in Asia than democracy. [[Lee Kuan Yew]] argued that:

{{quote|What Asians value may not necessarily be what Americans or Europeans value. Westerners value the freedoms and liberties of the individual. As an Asian of Chinese cultural background, my values are for a government which is honest, effective, and efficient.|[[Lee Kuan Yew]], ''Democracy, Human Rights and the Realities'', Tokyo, Nov 10, 1992&lt;ref&gt;Halper, Stefan. ''The Beijing consensus''. p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In response, critics have pointed out that cultural relativism could be used as a justification for authoritarianism. An example is in 1981, when the Iranian representative to the [[United Nations]], Said Rajaie-Khorassani, articulated the position of his country regarding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by saying that the UDHR was "a [[Secularism|secular]] understanding of the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing the Islamic law.&lt;ref name="Littman1999"&gt;Littman (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;
The Asian Values argument was criticised by Mahathir's former deputy:

{{quote|To say that freedom is Western or unAsian is to offend our traditions as well as our forefathers, who gave their lives in the struggle against tyranny and injustices.|[[Anwar Ibrahim|A. Ibrahim]] in his keynote speech to the Asian Press Forum titled ''Media and Society in Asia'', December 2, 1994}}

and by Singapore's opposition leader [[Chee Soon Juan]], who states that it is racist to assert that Asians do not want human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ball|Gready|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders of moral universalism argue that relativistic arguments neglect the fact that modern human rights are new to all cultures, dating back no further than the UDHR in 1948. They argue that the UDHR was drafted by people from many different cultures and traditions, including a US Roman Catholic, a Chinese Confucian philosopher, a French zionist and a representative from the Arab League, amongst others, and drew upon advice from thinkers such as Mahatma Gandhi.&lt;ref name="Gready34"/&gt; [[Michael Ignatieff]] has argued that cultural relativism is almost exclusively an argument used by those who wield power in cultures which commit human rights abuses, and that those whose human rights are compromised are the powerless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ignatieff|2001|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This reflects the fact that the difficulty in judging universalism versus relativism lies in who is claiming to represent a particular culture.

Although the argument between universalism and relativism is far from complete, it is an academic discussion in that all international human rights instruments adhere to the principle that human rights are universally applicable. The [[2005 World Summit]] reaffirmed the international community's adherence to this principle:

{{quote|The universal nature of human rights and freedoms is beyond question.|2005 World Summit, paragraph 121}}

In [[mathematics]], '''hyperbolic space''' is a [[homogeneous space]] that has a [[constant function|constant]] negative [[Constant curvature|curvature]], where in this case the curvature is the sectional curvature.
It is [[hyperbolic geometry]] in more than 2 [[dimension (mathematics)|dimensions]], and is distinguished from [[Euclidean space]]s with [[zero]] curvature that define the [[Euclidean geometry]], and [[elliptic geometry]] that have a constant positive curvature.

When embedded to a Euclidean space (of a higher dimension), every point of a hyperbolic space is a [[saddle point]]. Another distinctive property is the [[Riemannian volume form|amount of space]] covered by the [[n-ball|''n''-ball]] in hyperbolic ''n''-space: it increases [[exponential growth|exponentially]] with respect to the radius of the ball for large radii, rather than polynomially.

==Formal definition==
'''Hyperbolic ''n''-space''', denoted '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, is the maximally symmetric, [[simply connected]], ''n''-dimensional [[Riemannian manifold]] with a constant negative [[sectional curvature]]. 
Hyperbolic space is a space exhibiting [[hyperbolic geometry]]. 
It is the negative-curvature analogue of the ''n''-[[sphere]].  Although hyperbolic space '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is [[diffeomorphic]] to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, its negative-curvature metric gives it very different geometric properties.

Hyperbolic 2-space, '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, is also called the [[hyperbolic plane]].

==Models of hyperbolic space==
Hyperbolic space, developed independently by [[Nikolai Lobachevsky]] and [[János Bolyai]], is a geometrical space analogous to [[Euclidean space]], but such that [[parallel postulate|Euclid's parallel postulate]] is no longer assumed to hold.  Instead, the parallel postulate is replaced by the following alternative (in two dimensions):
* Given any line ''L'' and point ''P'' not on ''L'', there are at least two distinct lines passing through ''P'' which do not intersect ''L''.
It is then a theorem that there are infinitely many such lines through ''P''. This axiom still does not uniquely characterize the hyperbolic plane up to [[isometry]]; there is an extra constant, the curvature {{nowrap|''K'' &lt; 0}},  which must be specified. However, it does uniquely characterize it up to [[Homothetic transformation|homothety]], meaning up to bijections which only change the notion of distance by an overall constant. By choosing an appropriate length scale, one can thus assume, without loss of generality, that {{nowrap|1=''K'' = −1}}.

Models of hyperbolic spaces that can be embedded in a flat (e.g. Euclidean) spaces may be constructed.  In particular, the existence of model spaces implies that the parallel postulate is [[logically independent]] of the other axioms of Euclidean geometry.

There are several important models of hyperbolic space: the '''Klein model''', the '''hyperboloid model''', the '''Poincaré ball model''' and the '''Poincaré half space model'''.  These all model the same geometry in the sense that any two of them can be related by a transformation that preserves all the geometrical properties of the space, including [[isometry]] (though not with respect to the metric of a Euclidean embedding).

===The hyperboloid model===
{{main|Hyperboloid model}}
The hyperboloid model realizes hyperbolic space as a hyperboloid in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; = {(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;∈'''R''',&amp;nbsp;''i''=0,1,...,''n''}.  The hyperboloid is the locus '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; of points whose coordinates satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;x_0^2-x_1^2-\cdots-x_n^2=1,\quad x_0&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;
In this model a ''line'' (or [[geodesic]]) is the curve formed by the intersection of '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with a plane through the origin in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The hyperboloid model is closely related to the geometry of [[Minkowski space]].  The [[quadratic form]]
:&lt;math&gt;Q(x) = x_0^2 - x_1^2 - x_2^2 - \cdots - x_n^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;
which defines the hyperboloid, [[polarization identity|polarizes]] to give the [[bilinear form]]
:&lt;math&gt;B(x,y) = (Q(x+y)-Q(x)-Q(y))/2=x_0y_0 - x_1y_1 - \cdots - x_n y_n .&lt;/math&gt;
The space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;, equipped with the bilinear form ''B'', is an (''n''+1)-dimensional Minkowski space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n'',1&lt;/sup&gt;.

One can associate a ''distance'' on the hyperboloid model by defining&lt;ref&gt;Note the similarity with the [[Elliptic geometry|chordal metric]] on a sphere, which uses trigonometric instead of hyperbolic functions.&lt;/ref&gt; the distance between two points ''x'' and ''y'' on '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to be
:&lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = \operatorname{arcosh} B(x,y) .&lt;/math&gt;
This function satisfies the axioms of a [[metric space]].  It is preserved by the action of the [[Lorentz group]] on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n'',1&lt;/sup&gt;.  Hence the Lorentz group acts as a [[transformation group]] preserving [[isometry]] on '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

===The Klein model===
{{main|Klein model}}
An alternative model of hyperbolic geometry is on a certain [[open set|domain]] in [[projective space]].  The Minkowski quadratic form ''Q'' defines a subset {{nowrap|''U''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ⊂ '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} given as the locus of points for which {{nowrap|''Q''(''x'') &gt; 0}} in the [[homogeneous coordinates]] ''x''.  The domain ''U''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is the '''Klein model''' of hyperbolic space.

The lines of this model are the open line segments of the ambient projective space which lie in ''U''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  The distance between two points ''x'' and ''y'' in ''U''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = \operatorname{arcosh}\left(\frac{B(x,y)}{\sqrt{Q(x)Q(y)}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
This is well-defined on projective space, since the ratio under the inverse hyperbolic cosine is homogeneous of degree 0.

This model is related to the hyperboloid model as follows.  Each point {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''U''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} corresponds to a line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; through the origin in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;, by the definition of projective space.  This line intersects the hyperboloid '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; in a unique point.  Conversely, through any point on '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, there passes a unique line through the origin (which is a point in the projective space).   This correspondence defines a [[bijection]] between ''U''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  It is an isometry, since evaluating {{nowrap|''d''(''x'',''y'')}} along {{nowrap|1=''Q''(''x'') = ''Q''(''y'') = 1}} reproduces the definition of the distance given for the hyperboloid model.

===The Poincaré ball model ===
{{main|Poincaré disc model}}

A closely related pair of models of hyperbolic geometry are the Poincaré ball and Poincaré half-space models.

The ball model comes from a [[stereographic projection]] of the hyperboloid in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; onto the hyperplane {''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}. In detail, let ''S'' be the point in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n'',1&lt;/sup&gt;  with coordinates (−1,0,0,...,0): the ''South pole'' for the stereographic projection.   For each point ''P'' on the hyperboloid '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, let ''P''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; be the unique point of intersection of the line ''SP'' with the plane {''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}.

This establishes a bijective mapping of '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; into the unit ball
:&lt;math&gt; B^n = \{(x_1,\ldots,x_n) | x_1^2+\cdots+x_n^2 &lt; 1\}&lt;/math&gt;
in the plane {''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}.

The geodesics in this model are [[semicircle]]s that are perpendicular to the boundary sphere of ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Isometries of the ball are generated by [[inversive geometry|spherical inversion]] in hyperspheres perpendicular to the boundary.

===The Poincaré half-space model ===
{{main|Poincaré half-plane model}}

The half-space model results from applying [[inversion in a circle]] with centre a boundary point of the Poincaré ball model ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; above and a radius of twice the radius.

This sends circles to circles and lines, and is moreover a [[conformal transformation]].  Consequently, the geodesics of the half-space model are lines and circles perpendicular to the boundary hyperplane.

==Hyperbolic manifolds==

Every [[complete space|complete]], [[connected space|connected]], [[simply connected]] manifold of constant negative curvature &amp;minus;1 is [[Isometry|isometric]] to the real hyperbolic space '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. As a result, the [[universal cover]] of any [[closed manifold]] ''M'' of constant negative curvature &amp;minus;1, which is to say, a [[hyperbolic manifold]], is  '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, every such ''M'' can be written as '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;/Γ where Γ is a [[torsion (algebra)|torsion-free]] [[discrete group]] of [[isometry|isometries]] on '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  That is, Γ is a [[lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattice]] in [[Indefinite orthogonal group|SO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'',1)]].

=== Riemann surfaces ===
Two-dimensional hyperbolic surfaces can also be understood according to the language of [[Riemann surface]]s. According to the [[uniformization theorem]], every Riemann surface is either elliptic, parabolic or hyperbolic. Most hyperbolic surfaces have a non-trivial [[fundamental group]] π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=Γ; the groups that arise this way are known as [[Fuchsian group]]s. The [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] '''H'''²/Γ of the upper half-plane [[Ideal (ring theory)|modulo]] the fundamental group is known as the [[Fuchsian model]] of the hyperbolic surface. The [[Poincaré half plane]] is also hyperbolic, but is [[simply connected]] and [[noncompact]]. It is the [[universal cover]] of the other hyperbolic surfaces.

The analogous construction for three-dimensional hyperbolic surfaces is the [[Kleinian model]].

'''Information seeking behavior''' refers to the way people [[Information seeking|search for]] and utilize information.&lt;ref&gt;Fairer–Wessels, 1990, page 361.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Thomas D. Wilson]] in his 1981 paper, on the grounds that the then current 'information needs' was unhelpful as a basis for a research agenda, since 'need' could not be directly observed, while how people behaved in seeking information could be observed and investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = T.D. | year =1981 | title = On user studies and information needs | url = | journal = [[Journal of Documentation]] | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 3–15 | doi=10.1108/eb026702}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is increasing work in the information searching field that is relating behaviors to underlying needs.&lt;ref&gt;BJ Jansen, D Booth, B Smith (2009) [https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/pubs/jansen_using_the_taxonomy_of_cognitive_learning_to_model_online_searching.pdf Using the taxonomy of cognitive learning to model online searching]. [[Information Processing and Management|Information Processing &amp; Management]]. 45 (6), 643-663.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Thomas D. Wilson|Wilson]] described information behavior as the totality of human behavior in relation to sources and channels of information, including both active and passive information-seeking, and information use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=T.D.|title=Human Information Behaviour|journal=Informing Science|year=2000|volume=3|issue=2|pages=49–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described information seeking behavior as purposive seeking of information as a consequence of a need to satisfy some goal.  Information seeking behavior is the micro-level of behavior employed by the searcher in interacting with information systems of all kinds, be it between the seeker and the system, or the pure method of creating and following up on a search.

A variety of theories of information behavior – e.g. [[Zipf]]'s principle of least effort, [[Brenda Dervin]]'s sensemaking, [[Elfreda Chatman]]'s life in the round – seek to understand the processes that surround information seeking.&lt;ref name="Case, DO 2012"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Looking for information: a survey of research on information seeking, needs and behavior|author=Case, DO|publisher= Emerald |year=2012|isbn= 9781780526546}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis of the most cited publications on information behavior during the first years of this century shows its theoretical nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gonzalez-Teruel | first1 = A | last2 = González-Alcaide | first2 = G | last3 = Barrios | first3 = M | last4 = Abad-García | first4 = MF. | year = 2015 | title = Mapping recent information behavior research: an analysis of co-authorship and co-citation networks | url = | journal = Scientometrics | volume = 103 | issue = 2| pages = 687–705 | doi=10.1007/s11192-015-1548-z| hdl = 2445/100263 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with some works that have a constructivist focus, using references to Dewey, Kelly, Bruner and Vygotsky,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Seeking Meaning: A process approach to library and information services |author= Kuhlthau, CC |publisher= Ablex |year=1993|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; others mention sociological concepts, such as Bourdieu's habitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Savolainen | first1 = R | year = 1995 | title = Everyday life information seeking approaching information seeking in the context of "way of life"  | url = | journal = Library &amp; Information Science Research | volume = 17 | issue = 13| pages = 259–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several adopt a constructionist-discursive focus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McKenzie | first1 = PJ | year = 2003 | title = A model of information practices in accounts of everyday-life information seeking  | url = | journal = Journal of Documentation | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–40 | doi=10.1108/00220410310457993}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas some, such as Chatman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chatman | first1 = EA | year = 1996 | title = The impoverished life-world of outsiders  | url = | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 193–206 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(199603)47:3&lt;193::aid-asi3&gt;3.3.co;2-m}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chatman | first1 = EA | year = 1999 | title = A theory of life in the round | url = | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science | volume = 50 | issue = 3| pages = 207–217 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(1999)50:3&lt;207::aid-asi3&gt;3.3.co;2-#}}&lt;/ref&gt; who can in general be described as using an ethnographic perspective, stand out for the quantity and diversity of references to social research.&lt;ref name="Case, DO 2012"/&gt; The term 'information behaviour' was also coined by Wilson and occasioned some controversy on its introduction,&lt;ref&gt;JESSE, discussion list http://listserv.utk.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9912&amp;L=JESSE&amp;D=0&amp;P=3346&lt;/ref&gt; but now seems to have been adopted, not only by researchers in information science but also in other disciplines.

The digital world is changing human information behavior and process. Focused almost exclusively on information seeking and using, information receiving, a central modality of the process is generally overlooked.  As information seeking continues to migrate to the Internet, and artificial intelligence continues to advance the analysis of user behavior on the Internet across a range of user interactions, information receiving moves to the heart of the process, as systems  "learn" what users like, want and need, as well as their search habits.&lt;ref&gt;(1998 October) Giannini, Tula. ASIS Annual Conference, Pittsburgh, PA. "Information Receiving, a Primary Mode of the Information Process.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information search process (ISP)===

[[Information search process|ISP]] was proposed and developed by [[Carol Kuhlthau]].

An holistic framework based initially on research into high school students, but extended over time to include a diverse range of people, including those in the workplace. It examined the role of emotions, specifically uncertainty, in the information seeking process, concluding that many searches are abandoned due to an overwhelmingly high level of uncertainty.&lt;ref name="Kuhlthau"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuhlthau|first=Carol|title=Carol Kuhlthau|url=http://wp.comminfo.rutgers.edu/ckuhlthau/|accessdate=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISP is a 6-stage process, with each stage each encompassing 4 aspects;
* Cognitive (thoughts) – what is to be accomplished
* Affective (feelings) – what the searcher was feeling
* Actions (physical) – what the searcher did
* Strategies (physical) – what the searcher was trying to achieve&lt;ref name="Kuhlthau"/&gt;

===David Ellis===

Investigated the behavior of researchers in the physical and social sciences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=David|author2=Cox, Deborah, Hall, Katherine|title=A COMPARISON OF THE INFORMATION SEEKING PATTERNS OF RESEARCHERS IN THE PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES|journal=Journal of Documentation|year=1993|volume=49|issue=4|pages=356–369|doi=10.1108/eb026919}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and engineers and research scientists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=David|first=Ellis|author2=Haugan, Merete|title=Modelling the information seeking patterns of engineers and research scientists in an industrial environment|journal=Journal of Documentation|year=1997|volume=53|issue=4|pages=384–403|doi=10.1108/eum0000000007204}}&lt;/ref&gt;  through semi-structured interviews using a [[grounded theory]] approach, with a focus on describing the activities rather than a process.

These initial investigations produced six key activities within the information seeking process:

*Starting (activities that form the information search)
*Chaining (backwards or forwards – following references in initial information sources)
*Browsing (semi-directed search)
*Differentiating (filtering and selecting sources based on judgement of quality and relevance)
*Monitoring ([[wikt:up-to-date|keeping track of developments in an area]])
*Extracting (systematic extraction of material of interest from sources)

Later studies by Ellis (focusing on academic researchers in other disciplines) resulted in the addition of two more activities;

* Verifying (checking accuracy)
* Ending (a final search, checking all material covered)

===Episodic model===

The episodic model was developed by [[Nicholas J. Belkin]].

The episodic model is based largely on intuition and insight and concentrates on interactions with information. There are 4 dimensions which characterize search behavior. These dimensions can be combined in 16 different ways.

* Method of interaction (scanning/searching)
* Goal of interaction (learning/selecting)
* Mode of retrieval (recognition/specification)
* Resource considered (information/meta-information)

===Anomalous state of knowledge (ASK)===

ASK was also developed by Nicholas J. Belkin.

An anomalous state of knowledge is one in which the searcher recognises a gap in the state of knowledge. This, his further hypothesis, is influential in studying why people start to search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Belkin | first1 = Nicholas J | year = | title = Anomalous states of knowledge as a basis for information retrieval | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 133–143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilson's theory of information behavior===
{{main article|Wilson's model of information behavior|Thomas D. Wilson}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:P269fig3.jpg|thumb|alt=A simple diagram|A basic diagram illustrating Wilson's theory]] --&gt;
Thomas Wilson proposed that information behavior covers all aspects of human information behavior, whether active or passive.

Information ''Seeking'' behavior is the act of actively seeking information in order to answer a specific query.

Information ''Searching'' behavior is the behavior which stems from the searcher interacting with the system in question.  This system could be a technological one, such as the searcher interacting with a search engine, or a manual one, such as the searcher selecting which book is most pertinent to their query.

Information ''Use'' behavior pertains to the searcher adopting the knowledge they sought.

===Information foraging===
{{main article|Information foraging}}
Developed by [[Stuart Card]], [[Ed H. Chi]] and [[Peter Pirolli]].

This model is derived from anthropological theories and is comparable to foraging for food. Information seekers use clues (or information scents) such as links, summaries and images to estimate how close they are to target information. A scent must be obvious as users often browse aimlessly or look for specific information. Information foraging is descriptive of why and not how people search in particular ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chi | first1 = E.H | last2 = Pirolli | first2 = P | last3 = Chen | first3 = K | last4 = Pitkow | first4 = J. | year = | title = Using information scent to model user information needs and actions and the web | url = | journal = In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | volume = 2001 | issue = | pages = 490–497 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life in the round===

Developed by [[Elfreda Chatman]].

She defines life in the round as a world of tolerated approximation. It acknowledges reality at its most routine, predictable enough that unless an initial problem should arise, there is no point in seeking information.&lt;ref name="Chatman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chatman | first1 = Elfreda | year = 1999| title = A theory of life in the round | url = | journal = The Journal of the American Society for Information Science | volume = 50 | issue = 3| pages = 207–217 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(1999)50:3&lt;207::aid-asi3&gt;3.0.co;2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatman examined this principle within a small world: a world which imposes on its participants similar concerns and awareness of who is important; which ideas are relevant and whom to trust. Participants in this world are considered insiders.&lt;ref name="Chatman"/&gt;

Chatman focused her study on women at a maximum security prison. She learned that over time, prisoner's private views were assimilated to a communal acceptance of life in the round: a small world perceived in accordance with agreed upon standards and communal perspective. Members who live in the round will not cross the boundaries of their world to seek information unless it is critical; there is a collective expectation that information is relevant; or life lived in the round no longer functions. The world outside prison has secondary importance to inmates who are absent from this reality which is changing with time.&lt;ref name="Chatman"/&gt;

===Sensemaking===
{{main article|Sensemaking}}
[[Brenda Dervin]] developed the concept of sensemaking.  Sensemaking considers how we (attempt to) make sense of uncertain situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Klein | first1 = G. | last2 = Moon | first2 = B. | last3 = Hoffman | first3 = R.F. | year = 2006| title = Making sense of sensemaking I: alternative perspectives | url = | journal = IEEE Intelligent Systems | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 70–73 | doi=10.1109/mis.2006.75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her description of Sensemaking consisted of the definition of how we interpret information to use for our own information related decisions.

Brenda Dervin described sensemaking as a method through which people make sense of their worlds in their own language.

===Principle of least effort===
This principle explains that information seekers prioritise the most convenient path to acceptable information.&lt;ref&gt;Case Donald O. "Principle of least effort,"''Theories Of Information Behavior'', Karen Fisher ed. p50.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{main article|Principle of least effort}}

===Navigators and explorers===
This compares the internet search methods of experienced information seekers (navigators) and inexperienced information seekers (explorers). Navigators revisit domains; follow sequential searches and have few deviations or regressions within their search patterns and interactions. Explorers visit many domains; submit many questions and their search trails branch frequently.&lt;ref&gt;White, Ryen W and Drucker, Steven M "Investigating behavioural variability in web search," ''16th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW 2007)''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Information sources: Other people and/or information repositories ===
Robinson's (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = M. A. | year = 2010 | title = An empirical analysis of engineers' information behaviors | url = | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | volume = 61 | issue = 4| pages = 640–658 | doi = 10.1002/asi.21290 }}&lt;/ref&gt; research suggests that when seeking information at work, people rely on both other people and information repositories (e.g., documents and databases), and spend similar amounts of time consulting each (7.8% and 6.4% of work time, respectively; 14.2% in total). However, of theoretical interest, the distribution of time among the constituent information seeking stages differs depending on the source. When consulting other people, people spend less time locating the information source and information within that source, similar time understanding the information, and more time problem solving and decision making, than when consulting information repositories. Furthermore, the research found that people spend substantially more time receiving information passively (i.e., information that they have not requested) than actively (i.e., information that they have requested), and this pattern is also reflected when they provide others with information.

==Similarities between models==
A review of the literature on information seeking behavior shows that information seeking has generally been accepted as dynamic and non-linear (Foster, 2005; Kuhlthau 2006). People experience the [[information search process]] as an interplay of thoughts, feelings and actions ([[Carol Kuhlthau|Kuhlthau, 2006]]).

Information seeking has been found to be linked to a variety of interpersonal communication behaviors beyond question-asking, to include strategies such as candidate answers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

A search for information may be linked to [[decision making]]. The decision involved may vary from a trivial personal matter to a decision which affects billions or may have cumulative economic or political effects as individual buying or voting decisions may.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Looking for information: a survey of research on information seeking, needs and behavior|author=Case, Donald O.|publisher=Academic Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-12-369430-0|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

Nicolaisen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nicolaisen|first=J.|year=2009|title=Compromised need and the label effect: An examination of claims and evidence|url=|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|volume=60|issue=10|pages=2004–2009|doi=10.1002/asi.21129|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; described four distinct types of information seeking behavior: visceral, conscious, formalized and compromised.  The visceral need is expressed as the actual information need before it has been expressed.  The conscious need is the need once it has been recognized by the seeker.  The formalized need is the statement of the need and the compromised need is the query when related to the information system.

[http://www.jisc.ac.uk/ JISC]'s study of the Google Generation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=JISC|title=The Google Generation|url=http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/resourcediscovery/googlegen.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; detailed six different characteristics of online information seeking behavior;

* horizontal information seekers
* navigation
* viewers
* squirreling behavior
* diverse information seekers
* checking information seekers.

Horizontal information seeking is the method sometimes referred to as "[[Skimming (reading)|skimming]]".  An information seeker who skims views a couple of pages, then subsequently follows other links without necessarily returning to the initial sites.  Navigators, as might be expected, spend their time finding their way around.  Wilson found that users of e-book or e-journal sites were most likely spend, on average, a mere four to eight minutes viewing said sites.  Squirreling behavior relates to users who download lots of documents but might not necessarily end up reading them.  Checking information seekers assess the host in order to ascertain trustworthiness.  The bracket of users named diverse information seekers are users whose behavior differs from the above sectors.

{{Infobox organization|logo=Immi.png|formation=2011}}
The '''International Modern Media Institute''' ('''IMMI''') is an international institution with the aim of promoting debate about laws good for [[freedom of information]], [[freedom of speech|speech]], and [[freedom of expression|expression]]. The institute does this by offering advice and guidance in relation to legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.immi.is/about-immi/|title=About IMMI|website=en.immi.is|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History&lt;!-- Part of this history should be moved to [[Icelandic Modern Media Initiative]]. --&gt;==
On 18 February 2010&lt;!-- incorrect? Institute was founded in 2011 according to their website.   --&gt;, the institute entered a parliamentary resolution proposal, commonly known as the [[Icelandic Modern Media Initiative]], into the [[Iceland]]ic Parliament [[Althing|Alþingi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.althingi.is/altext/138/s/0688.html|title=Alþingi.is: Þskj. 688.

The proposal passed on 16 June was not a piece of final legislation. Instead, it began a process of editing 13 separate laws according to the proposal's specifications. This process was expected to be completed by mid-2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=ICELAND TO BECOME INTERNATIONAL TRANSPARENCY HAVEN | url=http://immi.is/?l=en&amp;p=intro | accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Iceland seeks to become sanctuary for free speech | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-iceland-free-speech-20110403,0,5332545.story | date=2 April 2011 | publisher =[[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate= 3 April 2011 | first=Henry | last=Chu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After WikiLeaks exposed the loan book of [[Kaupthing Bank]], one of the largest news channels, RUV, was injuncted from displaying the news story. Instead they were forced to simply put a message up of the WikiLeaks website. This led to WikiLeaks being invited by the Digital Freedoms Society to attend an annual conference in Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mirror.wikileaks.info/leak/kaupthing-claims.pdf |title=WIKILEAKS - - List of claims lodged against Kaupthing Bank hf, January 23, 2010 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.forbes.com/andygreenberg/2010/12/07/meet-the-new-public-face-of-wikileaks-kristinn-hrafnsson/?boxes=techchannellighttop |title=Meet The New Public Face Of WikiLeaks: Kristinn Hrafnsson - Forbes |publisher=Blogs.forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://icelandweatherreport.com/2009/08/kaupthings-loan-book-exposed-and-an-injunction-ordered-against-ruv.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110627010846/http://icelandweatherreport.com/2009/08/kaupthings-loan-book-exposed-and-an-injunction-ordered-against-ruv.html |date=June 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8504972.stm | work=BBC News | first=Chris | last=Vallance | title=Iceland to be 'journalism haven' | date=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support and endorsements==
The IMMI project was cooperatively organised by numerous organisations and members of the Icelandic parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayonline.com/World/EDC100217-0000054/Iceland-to-become-haven-for-reporters |accessdate=February 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221082141/http://www.todayonline.com/World/EDC100217-0000054/Iceland-to-become-haven-for-reporters |archivedate=February 21, 2010| title=Iceland to become 'haven' for reporters }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its principal endorsers were [[Eva Joly]], [[Index on Censorship]], the [[Icelandic Digital Freedom Society]], [[WikiLeaks]], and Icelandic MPs such as [[Birgitta Jónsdóttir]] and [[Róbert Marshall]]. The project has also had public endorsements from various organisations such as [[Global Voices Online|Global Voices]], [[La Quadrature du Net]] and the [[Free Knowledge Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://immi.is/?l=en&amp;p=endorsements |title=Icelandic Modern Media Initiative: Endorsements |publisher=Immi.is |date= |accessdate=2013-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Iriomote cat''' (''Prionailurus bengalensis iriomotensis'') is a [[Subspecies (biology)|subspecies]] of the [[leopard cat]] that lives exclusively on the [[Japan]]ese island of [[Iriomote]]. It has been listed as [[critically endangered]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] since 2008, as the only population comprises fewer than 250 adult individuals and is considered declining.&lt;ref name=iucn&gt;{{IUCN |assessor=Izawa, M. |assessor2=Doi T. |last-assessor-amp=yes|year=2016 |title=Prionailurus bengalensis ssp. iriomotensis |id=18151 |version=2016.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, there were an estimated 100–109 individuals remaining.&lt;ref name=Ministry_environment /&gt;

In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], it is called {{nihongo3|"Iriomote mountain cat"|西表山猫|'''Iriomote-yamaneko'''}}. In local dialects of the [[Yaeyama language]], it is known as {{nihongo3|"the cat in the mountain"|ヤママヤー|'''yamamayaa'''}}, {{nihongo3|"that which shines on the mountain"|ヤマピカリャー|'''yamapikaryaa'''}}, and {{nihongo3|"that which has flashing eyes"|メーピスカリャー|'''meepisukaryaa'''}}.&lt;ref name="Imaizumi1994-Yamapika"&gt;今泉(1994), Pp.8–13, Pp. 144-147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Togawa1972-1&gt;戸川(1972), Pp.13–92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Iriomote yamaneko stuffed.jpg|thumb|right|A taxidermied Iriomote cat at the Iriomote Wildlife Conservation Center. It has dark gray and brown fur, rounded ears, light amber eyes, and a flattened nose.]]
The fur of the Iriomote cat is mostly dark gray and light brown, with lighter hair on the belly and insides of the limbs. Hair along the jaw is white.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; There are two dark brown spots on each cheek. There are 5–7 stripes spanning from the forehead to the back of the head, but, unlike the leopard cat, the stripes stop before reaching the shoulders.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ohara_2000 /&gt; Dark brown spots cover the sides of the body, and there are 3–4 bands of irregular stripes on the chest.&lt;ref name=Ohara_2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1991 /&gt; The tail is dark brown; darker spots pattern the back side of the tail while the underside of the tail is solid. The tip of the tail is dark.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;

The tips of the ears are rounded, with black hair along the edge. There are no tufts of longer hair on the top of the ears. Adult Iriomote cats have a white spot on the back of each ear, much like those found on [[tiger]]s' ears.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; Young Iriomote cats do not have these marks, and even as adults the spots will not be as white as those seen on other leopard cat subspecies.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;

The Iriomote cat's eyes are a light amber color.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; Its nose is large and flat, with no fur covering the reddish-brown skin.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ohara_2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1991 /&gt; The paw ranges from {{convert|29|-|37|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide, in contrast to the {{convert|24|-|30|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide paw of a [[domestic cat]].&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;

The skull is longer and more narrow than that of a domestic cat. When compared to the leopard cat's skull, the Iriomote cat's is roughly the same size but thicker. Because of this, the Iriomote cat's brain is smaller; a male leopard cat's brain is about 42 grams, whereas a male Iriomote cat's brain is about 30 grams.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; The [[occipital bone]] of the skull and the auditory capsule are not connected.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1991 /&gt; The [[mandibular symphysis]] is short.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ohara_2000 /&gt;

Male Iriomote cats grow to be {{convert|50|-|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and weigh {{convert|3.5|-|5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Females are smaller at about {{convert|50|-|55|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|-|3.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Red_2005 /&gt; Their tails are thick from base to tip and {{convert|23|-|24|cm|in|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48&gt;{{cite book |last=今泉 |first=忠明 |script-title=ja:イリオモテヤマネコの百科 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Iriomote Wild Cat Encyclopedia |isbn=4887182856 |publisher=Data House |year=1994 |pages=7–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ohara_2000 /&gt; They have long torsos and short, thick limbs.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; Their necks are also thick, and their shoulders are muscular, though their jumping power is comparatively weak. Unlike other small cats, their spines cannot bend sharply.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;

The Iriomote cat has six pairs of [[incisors]], two pairs of [[canine teeth]], four pairs of [[premolars]], and two pairs of [[molars]] for a total of 28 teeth. Compared to other cats, including small wild cats, the Iriomote cat is lacking one pair of premolars on the top jaw behind the canines.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; In addition to this, unlike most other subtropical mammals, Iriomote cats' teeth give details about their year-to-year history. It is expected that these details will help determine the age and behavior of the cats.&lt;ref name=Tooth_age&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ryukyushimpo.jp/news/storyid-169649-storytopic-5.html |script-title=ja:イリオモテヤマネコ、歯年輪で年齢判別 |author=琉球新報 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Iriomote Cat, Tooth Rings Show Age |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology and behavior==
Iriomote cats are [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]], but climb trees, go into the water and also swim.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Shizenkan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_2004 /&gt; They are [[nocturnal]] and especially active during [[twilight]] hours.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Center /&gt; During the daytime, they sleep in tree hollows or in caves. They mark their [[territory (animal)|territory]] by [[urinating]] and [[defecating]] on rocks, tree stumps and bushes. Their home ranges vary from {{convert|1|to|7|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in size.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ohara_2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Red_2005 /&gt;

===Home range===
Iriomote cats are usually solitary. Their home range varies seasonally and also individually, and is smaller during the mating season. In 1998 and 1999, a male and a female Iriomote cat were [[Radio telemetry|radio tracked]] for seven to 13 successive days in the western part of the island. Their home ranges overlapped extensively in all periods. The periodical home range of the male was {{convert|0.83|–|1.65|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in size, and the resident female's range was {{convert|0.76|–|1.84|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Center /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-75-117 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nakanishi05&gt;Nakanishi, N., Okamura, M., Watanabe, S., Izawa, M., Doi, T. (2005). [http://www.bioone.org/doi/pdf/10.3106/1348-6160%282005%2930%5B1%3ATEOHOH%5D2.0.CO%3B2 ''The effect of habitat on home range size in the Iriomote Cat "Prionailurus bengalensis iriomotensis" '']. Mammal Study 30: 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Iriomote cats are [[Territoriality|territorial]].&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-75-117 /&gt; Home ranges of males and females overlap, and one to two females live within a male's home range.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-75-117 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Yamaneko_center /&gt; Typically, home ranges of same gender cats will not overlap, but partial overlaps are seen.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-75-117 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Yamaneko_center /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wildlife_2006 /&gt; Often, these small overlaps are hunting grounds.&lt;ref name=Wildlife_2006 /&gt; It is thought that they patrol their territories during three to four days, marking and hunting as they go.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-75-117 /&gt;

Young male Iriomote cats and some adult cats are transient, i. e. wandering over the island and waiting for an open home range slot that they can occupy by marking this area.&lt;ref name=Yamaneko_center /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wildlife_2006 /&gt; Female cats allow their young to stay in their own home range and mark a new territory once the next breeding season comes.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ohara_2000 /&gt;

===Feeding ecology===
[[File:Slaty-legged Crake ( Rallina eurizonoides).jpg|thumb|right|[[Slaty-legged crake]]s make up a portion of Iriomote cats' diet]]
Iriomote cats are [[carnivorous]] and prey on various mammals, [[birds]], [[reptiles]], [[amphibians]], [[fish]], and [[crustaceans]]. They typically ingest {{convert|400–600|g|lb|abbr=on}} of food a day.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_2004 /&gt; Other wild cats primarily hunt small mammals, such as [[rodents]] and [[rabbits]], but because there are no other carnivores to compete with the Iriomote cat on the island, there is no need for them to isolate themselves from the various habitats and food sources that are available. Thus, their diet is quite varied.&lt;ref name=Wildlife_2006&gt;{{Cite book |author=財団法人　自然環境研究センター |title=イリオモテヤマネコBOOK |language=Japanese |trans-title=The Iriomote Cat BOOK |publisher= 株式会社高陽堂印刷 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mammalian prey includes [[black rats]], [[Ryukyu flying fox]]es and young Ryukyu [[wild boar]]. Their prey also includes a wide range of birds, such as the [[spot-billed duck]], [[slaty-legged crake]], [[Eurasian scops-owl]], [[pale thrush]], and [[white-breasted waterhen]].&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Red_2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Center /&gt;
Reptiles include various types of snakes and [[Eumeces kishinouyei|Kishinoue's giant skink]].&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Red_2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Center /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakaguchi, N., Ono, Y. (1994). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/v861r72n28545275/fulltext.pdf ''Seasonal change in the food habits of the Iriomote cat 'Felis iriomotensis' '']. Ecological Research 9 (2): 167−174.&lt;/ref&gt; They are also known to hunt [[rice frog|Sakishima rice frogs]], [[yellow-spotted crickets]] and [[crabs]].&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Red_2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Center /&gt; As their hunting grounds tend to be in [[swamps]] or on [[shore]]s, they sometimes swim and dive to catch water birds, fish, and freshwater prawns.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wildlife_2006 /&gt;

When eating birds that are larger than a [[dusky thrush]], most types of cats will pluck the feathers and then eat it, but the Iriomote cat will eat even large birds whole without removing the feathers.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_2004 /&gt; Also, unlike other cats, the Iriomote cat does not kill its prey immediately by breaking the [[spinal cord]]. Instead, it holds the animal in its mouth until it stops moving.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;

It is estimated that water birds comprise about 60% of the cat's diet with black rats being its secondary source of food at about 10–30% of its diet.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-75-117 /&gt; Based on [[feces|stool]] samples, birds represent 60% of their diet, black rats 30%, insects 30%, lizards and frogs about 15–20%, bats 3–17%, and wild pig less than 1%. In addition, fish and crustaceans appear roughly 3–4% of the time.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-75-117&gt;{{cite book |last=今泉 |first=忠明 |script-title=ja:イリオモテヤマネコの百科 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Iriomote Wild Cat Encyclopedia |isbn=4887182856 |publisher=Data House |year=1994 |pages=75–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-75-117 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Anma_2001&gt;{{Cite book |last= 安間 |first=繁樹 |script-title=ja:琉球列島　生物の多様性と列島のおいたち |language=Japanese |trans-title=The Ryukyu Archipelago: Diversity of Animals and Island Development |pages=112–147 |isbn= 978-4-48601555-0 |publisher= 東海大学出版会 |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seasonal dietary changes have been observed. They eat rats and frogs year-round, lizards in the summer and spring, and crickets and bats more often in the fall and winter.&lt;ref name=Wildlife_2006 /&gt;

===Reproductive behavior===
During the [[mating season]], Iriomote cats become active during the day as well.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt; Breeding females are more active than nonbreeding ones during the late night and morning hours.&lt;ref name=schmidt09&gt;Schmidt, K., Nakanishi, N.,Izawa, M., Okamura, M., Watanabe, S., Tanaka, S. Doi, T. (2009). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/y7v7w37h8143v413/fulltext.pdf ''The reproductive tactics and activity patterns of solitary carnivores: the Iriomote cat'']. Journal of Ethology 27: 165–174.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the mating season the cats live in solitary, but when they begin breeding they act together.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-75-117 /&gt; The mating season lasts from December to March, and females go into heat several times during this period, with the peak being in January and February.&lt;ref name=Red_2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-75-117 /&gt;&lt;ref name=schmidt09/&gt; Towards the end of February, they fast for about two weeks. It is during this period that females are most sexually excited. Male and female cats always stay together at this time, and it is thought that [[fertilisation|conception]] happens during these two weeks.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt;

Pregnancy is [[viviparity|viviparous]], and between April and June pregnant female cats give birth to 1–3 kittens in a tree hollow or cavern.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Yamaneko_center&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iwcc.a.la9.jp/ym_about.htm |script-title=ja:イリオモテヤマネコについて |author=西表野生生物保護センター |language=Japanese |trans-title=About Iriomote Cats |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The locations chosen for birthing and rearing are dry and have good ventilation.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt; Kittens stay with their mother for about eleven months.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt; They begin to become more independent during the fall and winter months. They stay in their mother's home range from anywhere between a few months and years.&lt;ref name=Wildlife_2006 /&gt; Kittens reach [[sexual maturity|maturity]] twenty months after birth.&lt;ref name=Ohara_2000 /&gt;

===Lifespan===
It is estimated that Iriomote cats live for seven to eight years in the wild, and eight to nine years in captivity.&lt;ref name=Ohara_2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt; Human influences, traffic accidents and [[animal trapping|traps]] may lower their lifespan to two to five years.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt; In captivity, an Iriomote cat lived for an estimated 15 years and one month, the longest known lifespan of any Iriomote cat.&lt;ref name=Yon_death&gt;{{cite web |author=Ealey, M. |url=http://english.ryukyushimpo.jp/2011/04/12/220/ |title=Oldest Iriomote wildcat dies aged 15 years one month |publisher=Ryukyu Shimpo |year=2011 |accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The Iriomote cat was discovered in 1965 by {{nihongo|Yukio Togawa|戸川幸夫|Togawa Yukio}}, an author who specialized in works about animals. In 1967, it was first described by [[Yoshinori Imaizumi]], director of the zoological department of the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]] in [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1967&gt;{{cite journal |last=Imaizumi |first1=Y. |year=1966–1967 |script-title=ja:琉球, 西表島産の山猫 (新属新種) について |language=Japanese |trans-title=A new genus and species of cat from Iriomote, Ryukyu Islands |journal=哺乳動物学雑誌 |volume=3 |pages=75–105 |publisher=日本哺乳動物学界 |issn=1884-393X |format=pdf |accessdate=June 8, 2012 |url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jmammsocjapan1952/3/4/3_4_75/_pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to its scientific discovery, the Iriomote cat was known locally by various names: {{nihongo3|"the cat in the mountain"|ヤママヤー|'''yamamayaa'''}}, {{nihongo3|"that which shines on the mountain"|ヤマピカリャー|'''yamapikaryaa'''}}. To distinguish between the Iriomote cat and other cats on the island, locals also gave other cats nicknames such as {{nihongo3||ピンギマヤ|pingimaya}} for stray cats and {{nihongo3||マヤ|maya}} or {{nihongo3||マヤグヮー|mayagwaa}} for house cats.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-8-13-144-147&gt;{{cite book |last=今泉 |first=忠明 |script-title=ja:イリオモテヤマネコの百科 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Iriomote Wild Cat Encyclopedia |isbn=4887182856 |publisher=Data House |year=1994 |pages=8–13, 144–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-8-13-144-147 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-13-92&gt;{{cite book |last=戸川 |first=幸夫 |script-title=ja:イリオモテヤマネコ：原始の西表で発見された〝生きた化石動物〟の謎 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Iriomote Cat: the Mystery of the "Living Fossil" Discovered on Primeval Iriomote Island |publisher=自由国民社 | year=1972 |pages=13–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, believed that the Iriomote cat was a [[feral]] cat.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1991 /&gt;

===Prior to specimen acquisition===
Based on information from the locals, {{nihongo4|Tetsuo Koura|高良鉄夫|Koura Tetsuo}} from the [[University of the Ryukyus]] was able to capture a kitten in 1962, but did not get an adult specimen.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt; In 1964, {{nihongo4|Tokio Takano|高野凱夫|Takano Tokio}} from the exploration department of [[Waseda University]] informed Imaizumi of the rumors of a cat living in the mountains of Iriomote.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;

In February 1965 Togawa visited the [[Yaeyama Islands]]. He had heard in [[Naha]] from a newspaper columnist that there were rumors of wild cats living on Iriomote.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-13-92 /&gt; He at first assumed that, like reports of the extinct [[Japanese wolf]], people must have been mistaking escaped and [[feral]] house pets for wild animals. He spoke with colleague Tetsuo Koura who knew of and believed there to be some truth to the rumors. Koura then entrusted Togawa with the task of acquiring evidence.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-13-92 /&gt; Togawa then traveled to Iriomote to gather information for his own report and to collect information on the Iriomote cat and a specimen.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-13-92 /&gt;

Upon arriving on the island, Togawa learned that because there wasn't enough food on Iriomote, people would cook Iriomote cats that had been caught and use the meat in soup. Cats caught in traps would also be disposed of, which made acquiring samples difficult.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-13-92 /&gt;

Following these discoveries, he went to the hamlet of {{nihongo4|Amitori|網取部落|Amitori Buraku}} on the western side of the island. There, a middle school teacher who had worked under Koura said that he had caught one of the cats in a trap set for wild boar. He had sent the skin to Koura but buried the rest of the body. Togawa dug up the remains and got the skull. He also found two feces samples near the village, and was able to get a skin from a fisherman who lived in {{nihongo4|Inaba|イナバ部落|Inaba Buraku}}, a hamlet along [[Urauchi River]].&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-13-92 /&gt;

He returned to Koura and sent the two skins, the feces, and the skull to Yoshinori Imaizumi at the National Museum of Nature and Science where {{nihongo4|[[The Mammalogical Society of Japan]]|日本哺乳動物学会|Nihon Honyū Dōbutsu Gakkai}} tested the subjects.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-13-92 /&gt; The analysis took place on March 14, 1965.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; The results showed the cat to be either a new species or a new subspecies, but there weren't enough samples to confirm. They requested either a complete set of remains or a live specimen.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; Following the announcement, some members of the society believed the samples to show simple mutations while others believed them to be the remains of wild cats that had previously been brought to and left on the island by foreign ships.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-13-92 /&gt;

===Live specimen acquisition to announcement===
In June 1965, Togawa returned to Iriomote with Koura in order to obtain a complete set of remains, a live specimen, and information regarding the cat's [[ecology]]. They brought box traps and [[Actinidia polygama|silvervine]] to aid their efforts in catching a live cat. According to hunters, though, only one or two cats per year were caught, and the number of remaining cats was probably quite low. Togawa did not expect to catch one alive.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-93-138&gt;{{cite book |last=戸川 |first=幸夫 |script-title=ja:イリオモテヤマネコ：原始の西表で発見された〝生きた化石動物〟の謎 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Iriomote Cat: the Mystery of the "Living Fossil" Discovered on Primeval Iriomote Island |publisher=自由国民社 | year=1972 |pages=93–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mare falls.jpg|thumb|right| Maaree Waterfall, where a group of children found an Iriomote cat on May 5, 1965]]
In May 1965, prior to Togawa's return to the island, a group of children from {{nihongo4|Ōhara Elementary School|大原小学校}} on a field trip to the southern part of the island found a weakened, injured male Iriomote cat at the base of the small {{nihongo4|Maaree Waterfall|マーレー滝|Maaree Taki}} on {{nihongo4|Haemita Beach|南風見田の浜|Haemita no Hama}}. The teacher in charge of the children took the cat. Another teacher preserved the pelt in [[formalin]] and buried the skeleton in a wooden box behind the school. Togawa exhumed the remains, and this cat became the prototype for the species.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-93-138 /&gt; In addition to this example, the scientists also were able to obtain the crushed skull of a kitten from the neighboring [[Yubu Island]] that was later reconstructed by Imaizumi.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-93-138 /&gt;

In addition to researching the Iriomote cat, Togawa also looked into rumors of a larger cat on the island (see [[#Yamapikaryaa]]) and conducted an investigation.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-93-138 /&gt; Before returning to [[Tokyo]], he offered $100 for any live Iriomote cat and $30 for dead cats that were brought to him. With the aid of the [[Taketomi, Okinawa|Taketomi]] mayor and the {{nihongo4|[[Daily Yaeyama Newspaper]]|八重山毎日新聞|Yaeyama Mainichi Shinbun}}, he was able to publicize the offer on bulletin boards and in other ways.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176 /&gt; He also announced rewards for the rumored large cat on the island: $200 if brought in alive, $100 for remains.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176 /&gt;

Through these offers, he acquired two complete skeletons, two skulls, and three pelts that he brought back with him to Tokyo. One of the pelts was that which the elementary school children helped obtain, and it was confirmed to be that of an Iriomote cat. The sample from Yubu Island was small, and judgment was held back. A sample from [[Ishigaki Island]] was discovered to be a house cat.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176 /&gt;

In January 1966, the body of an Iriomote cat that had been caught in a wild boar trap in the mid-basin of the [[Nakama River]] was sent to Koura at the University of the Ryukyus, but there was no more information regarding captures for some time after this.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176 /&gt; In December 1966, {{nihongo4|Hiroshi Kuroda|黒田宏|Kuroda Hiroshi}}, a hunter at the Nakama River's mid-basin, caught a live male cat, but it escaped immediately.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176 /&gt; He then caught another male cat soon after.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;

On January 15, 1966, local hunters caught a young female Iriomote cat near {{nihongo4|[[Nakama Mountain]]|仲間山|Nakama-yama}}.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176 /&gt; The National Museum of Nature and Science planned on using funds intended for garden repairs to pay for the specimens, but the hunters who caught the cats expected $1000–$3000 per cat.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176 /&gt; At the persuasion of the director of the District Forestry Office, the hunters accepted an award within the budget as a “daily allowance” or “finder's fee”.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176 /&gt;

During this time, the mayor of Taketomi was making negotiations with the {{nihongo4|[[Southern Japan Liaison Offices]]|南方連絡事務所|Nanpō Renraku Jimusho}} and the Ryukyu government. He traveled to Naha for these discussions, which covered the possibility of offering the two captured Iriomote cats to the [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]] with the stated purpose of increasing national knowledge about Iriomote and for the promotion of industrial development on the island. At the same time, the Taketomi town offices, under the premise of obtaining permission from the Ryukyu government to keep the cats, confiscated samples from the staff of the National Museum of Nature and Science and brought them back to their offices.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176 /&gt;

With Togawa pressuring the newspapers and Yoshinori Imaizumi urging the Ryukyuan government and Southern Japan Liaison Offices through the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Ministry of Education]], the Southern Japan Liaison Offices denied the possibility of giving the cats to the emperor, and the Ryukyuan government persuaded the mayor not to follow through with his plans. Finally, the specimens were delivered to the museum.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176 /&gt;

The cats arrived at [[Haneda airport]] in March 1967.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176 /&gt; Yoshinori Imaizumi kept them shortly until Togawa, having been entrusted by the museum to observe them, took charge of them for about two years.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-177-242&gt;{{cite book |last=戸川 |first=幸夫 |script-title=ja:イリオモテヤマネコ：原始の西表で発見された〝生きた化石動物〟の謎 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Iriomote Cat: the Mystery of the "Living Fossil" Discovered on Primeval Iriomote Island |publisher=自由国民社 | year=1972 |pages=177–242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cats were then transferred to the museum for monitoring. The male died on April 25, 1973 and the female on December 13, 1975. The male's pelt was temporarily [[Taxidermy|stuffed]], the blood was sent off for [[chromosomal]] research, and the rest of the body was preserved in [[formaldehyde]]. The female was stuffed and put on display in the museum.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;

In May 1967, The Mammalogical Society of Japan issued their third and fourth issues, announcing in English the discovery of a new genus of cat that was closely related to the primitive cat genus ''[[Metailurus]]''.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; The former genus name of ''Mayailurus'' stems from the word used for “cat” on Iriomote, ''maya-'', while ''-ailurus'' comes ancient Greek and also means “cat”.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; The subspecies name of ''iriomotensis'' means “from Iriomote”.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; The Japanese name of {{nihongo4|Togawa mountain cat|トガワヤマネコ|Togawa-yamaneko}} was proposed by Yoshinori Imaizumi, in honor of Togawa who discovered the species, but Togawa turned down the request and instead supported the name {{nihongo4|'''Iriomote cat'''|イリオモテヤマネコ|Iriomote-yamaneko}} based on the Tsushima cat, which was also named after the location at which it was discovered. Koura agreed with Togawa, thus officiating the name.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-13-92 /&gt;

==Classification and genealogy==
In 1967, Dr. {{nihongo4|Yoshinori Imaizumi|今泉吉典|Imaizumi Yoshinori}} announced the Iriomote cat to the scientific community as a new species of [[Felinae|feline]] in its own [[genus]]. It was labeled ''Mayailurus iriomotensis''.&lt;ref name=Masuda_1996 /&gt; Dr. Imaizumi pointed out that, compared to other leopard cats, the Iriomote cat retained some especially primitive features. Judging from these characteristics, Yoshinori Imaizumi estimated that the Iriomote cat appeared as a species sometime between ten million years ago in the [[Miocene epoch]] and three million years ago during the [[Pliocene epoch]]. He also believed that they shared many primitive characteristics with fossils in the extinct genus ''[[Metailurus]]''.&lt;ref name=Masuda_1996 /&gt; He emphasized these points, stating that the Iriomote cat and ''Metailurus'' shared a common ancestor sometime between ten million and five million years ago,&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Masuda_1996 /&gt; and from that he deducted that the Iriomote cat's ancestors must have widened its range from mainland [[Asia]] to Iriomote and other areas beginning three million years ago.&lt;ref name=Masuda_1996 /&gt; It appears to be a very ancient species, a ‘missing link’, nearer to the common root of the cat tribe than any other extant species.&lt;ref&gt;Leyhausen, P., Pfleiderer, M. (1999). ''The systematic status of the Iriomote cat (Prionailurus iriomotensis Imaizumi 1967) and the subspecies of the leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis Kerr 1792)''. Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research 37: 121–131.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Dr. Imaizumi's assertions about its unique characteristics, other researchers have strongly disputed the idea that the Iriomote cat is its own species ever since its discovery. Investigations involving skulls and teeth, samples and living animals, and genetic research were conducted to determine whether it is its own species or a subspecies of leopard cat.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Masuda_1996 /&gt; Because of these studies, it has been subordinated under the genus ''[[Prionailurus]]'' as ''Prionailurus iriomotensis''.&lt;ref name=msw3&gt;{{MSW3 Wozencraft |id=14000193 |pages=543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iriomote cat's [[karyotype]], the restriction fragment length of the [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA), and [[molecular phylogenetic]] analyses of the [[mitochondrial]] 12S rRNA and [[cytochrome b]] have proven to be identical, or nearly so, to the leopard cat's.&lt;ref name=Masuda_1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Suzuki_1994&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suzuki |first1=Hitoshi |last2=Hosoda |first2=Tetsuji |last3=Sakurai |first3=Susumu |last4=Tsuchiya |first4=Kimiyuki |last5=Munechika |first5=Isao |last6=Korablev |first6=Vladimir P. |date=August 1994 |title=Phylogenetic relationship between the Iriomote cat and the leopard cat, Felis bengalensis, based on the ribosomal DNA |journal=The Japanese Journal of Genetics |volume=69 |issue=4 |pages=397–406 |publisher=The Genetics Society of Japan |issn=0021-504X |doi=10.1266/jjg.69.397}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two cats are assumed to be extremely closely related, their differences being categorized as either intraspecies variations or individual [[mutations]]. Also, from the speed of cytochrome b's [[base-pair substitution]] and its diversity, it is estimated that the Iriomote cat diverged from the leopard cat around 180,000-200,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=Masuda_1995&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Masuda R, Yoshida MC |title=Two Japanese wildcats, the Tsushima cat and the Iriomote cat, show the same mitochondrial DNA lineage as the leopard cat ''Felis bengalensis'' |journal=Zoological Science |year= 1995 |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=656–9 |doi=10.2108/zsj.12.655}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[marine geology|marine geologists]], the [[Ryukyu Islands]] were connected to mainland Asia via a [[land bridge]] from about 20,000 years ago to 240,000 years ago. Scientists believe that the Iriomote cat moved its range to the islands during this period.&lt;ref name=Masuda_1996 /&gt; Because of this, it is assumed that there is little [[genetic variety]] within the species.&lt;ref name=Center /&gt;&lt;ref name=Warren_1999&gt;{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Warren E. |last2=Shinyashiki |first2=Fumiharu |last3=Menotti-Raymond |first3=Marilyn |last4=Driscoll |first4=Carlos |last5=Leh |first5=Charles |last6=Sunquist |first6=Mel |last7=Johnston |first7=Leslie |last8=Bush |first8=Mitchel |last9=Wildt |first9=David |last10=Yuhki |first10=Naoya |last11=O'Brien |first11=Stephen J. |title=Molecular Genetic Characterization of Two Insular Asian Cat Species, Bornean Bay Cat and Iriomote Cat |journal=Evolutionary Theory and Processes: Modern Perspectives |year= 1999 |pages=223–248 |displayauthors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats==
[[File:Warning signs for Iriomote cat.jpg|thumb|right|Sign warning motorists of animals, with a picture of an Iriomote cat]]
Destruction of habitat due to development, predation by dogs, traffic accidents, and traps set for wild boar and crabs all contribute to the decline in number of Iriomote cats.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ohara_2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Red_2005 /&gt; During the second survey of the island, conducted from 1982–1984, it was estimated that 83–108 Iriomote cats lived on the island. The third survey, conducted from 1993–1994, estimated that 99–110 of the cats were on the island. During the fourth survey, conducted from 2005–2007, there were an estimated 100–109 remaining cats.&lt;ref name=Ministry_environment&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/press/press.php?serial=10060 |script-title=ja:イリオモテヤマネコ生息状況等総合調査（第４次）の結果について（お知らせ） |author=環境省 |language=Japanese |trans-title=(Fourth) Survey of the State of the Iriomote Cat's Habitat: Regarding the Results (notice) |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Center /&gt; The method of estimating the numbers differed between the third and fourth surveys, though; if the third estimate were to be revised, there would have been an estimated 108–118 Iriomote cats at the time, meaning that the population is shrinking over time.&lt;ref name=Ministry_environment /&gt;

Along with the traffic accidents, logging due to development, and development of the swamplands, house pets are also causing problems. House cats and stray cats especially cause issues with competition, disease transmission, and [[genetic pollution]] due to [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] born of inter-species breeding. It is also feared that dogs prey on the Iriomote cats.&lt;ref name=Red_2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Center /&gt;&lt;ref name=tropics&gt;{{cite journal|author=伊津雅子, 阪口法明|author2=土肥昭夫|last-author-amp=yes|year=2000|title=Recent conservation programs for the Iriomote cat Felis iriomotensis|journal=Tropics|volume=10|issue=1|pages=79–85|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tropics/10/1/10_1_79/_pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iriomote wildlife conservation centre.jpg|thumb|left|Iriomote Wildlife Conservation Center]]
The primary fear stems from house cats that have become feral or partially feral, but there has been no monitoring of these interactions. Pressure from competition over food, contact with house cats that have contracted [[feline immunodeficiency virus]] (FIV) and other contagious diseases, as well as decrease in population due to hybridization are all important issues with the Iriomote cat.&lt;ref name=Red_2005 /&gt;

In June 1999, the Iriomote Wildlife Protection Center conducted an investigation among 50 house and feral cats and 23 Iriomote cats in order to see if FIV was being transmitted within the populations. FIV was not seen in any of the Iriomote cats, but three of the house and feral cats tested positive.&lt;ref name=Cat_AIDS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iwcc.a.la9.jp/iwcc.htm |script-title=ja:西表で猫エイズ初確認/イリオモテヤマネコへの感染懸念/環境庁などが野良猫調査/県、竹富町と対策協議へ*影響は全く未知数 |author=琉球新報 |language=Japanese |trans-title=First Confirmation of Feline AIDS on Iriomote/Fears of Transmission to Iriomote Cats/EPA Surveys Strays/Okinawa Prefecture, Taketomi Town to Discuss Counter-Measures*Number Affected Unknown |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the fears regarding transmission of the disease, starting in 2001 Taketomi Town enacted the Cat Breeding Ordinance which required all residents to register their pet cats. In June 2008, the ordinance was revised to include mandatory FIV testing and vaccinations, spaying and neutering, and microchipping. A new limit to the number of pets allowed per owner was also added.&lt;ref name=Desex&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ryukyushimpo.jp/news/storyid-133305-storytopic-1.html |script-title=ja:飼い猫の避妊義務化　イリオモテヤマネコ保護 |author=琉球新報 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Desexing of House Cats Becomes Mandatory; Preservation of Iriomote Cats |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the [[cane toad]], which secretes a poisonous liquid from glands in its ears, has also appeared on the island. In order to prevent further contamination of Iriomote, residents of Ishigaki Island began extermination measures in 2008.&lt;ref name=IWCC_Crisis&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iwcc.a.la9.jp/ym_kiki.htm |script-title=ja:ヤマネコにせまる危機 |author=IWCC |language=Japanese |trans-title=Crisis Approaching Iriomote Cats |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Invasive&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.y-mainichi.co.jp/news/15157/ |script-title=ja:外来生物次々と侵入　広がる生態系への影響 |author=八重山毎日新聞 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Invasive Species Come One After Another; The Broadening Ecological Influences |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==

===Status===
Since 2008, the Iriomote cat is categorized as "critically endangered" by IUCN.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

The Iriomote cat has been designated a natural monument by the [[Okinawa]] government.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176&gt;{{cite book |last=戸川 |first=幸夫 |script-title=ja:イリオモテヤマネコ：原始の西表で発見された〝生きた化石動物〟の謎 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Iriomote Cat: the Mystery of the "Living Fossil" Discovered on Primeval Iriomote Island |publisher=自由国民社 | year=1972 |pages=139–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 15, 1972, along with the recovery of Okinawa, it was nationally recognized as a [[Monuments of Japan#Natural Monuments and Special Natural Monuments|natural monument]]. On March 15, 1977, it was given special status amongst natural monuments, and in 1994 with the Species Protection Act, it was designated as a {{nihongo4|Specified National Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora|国内希少野生動植物種|Kokunai Kishō Yasei Dōshokubutsu-shu}}.&lt;ref name=Kato_1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Center /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rare_animals&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/nature/yasei/hozonho/list_domestic.pdf |script-title=ja:国内希少野生動植物種 |author=環境省 |language=Japanese |trans-title=National Rare Species |accessdate=10 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620202308/http://www.env.go.jp/nature/yasei/hozonho/list_domestic.pdf |archivedate=20 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This act was adopted on January 28 and enacted on March 1.&lt;ref name=Ministry_nature&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/press/press.php?serial=8648 |title=哺乳類、汽水・淡水魚類、昆虫類、貝類、植物 I 及び植物 II のレッドリストの見直しについて |author=環境省自然環境局野生生物課 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Mammals, Brackish Water and Fresh Water Fish, Insects, Shellfish, and Plants I Plants II Regarding Changes to the Red List |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Projects and activities===
In 1977, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] wrote a letter addressed to Crown Prince [[Akihito]] regarding the preservation of the Iriomote cat. The report attached to the letter (written by Professor Leyhausen) suggested outlawing any further migration to the island as well as banning the cultivation of the land.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt; In response, Crown Prince Akihito said that he wished for a way that would allow for the preservation of the cats and the continued habitation of people on the island. He also explained that the prime minister at the time, [[Takeo Fukuda]], was considering the implementation of a wildlife sanctuary on Iriomote.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt;

[[File:Iriomote yamaneko warning sign.jpg|thumb|left|Sign warning motorists of Iriomote cats. The number is used in reporting sightings of the cat.]]
In 1972, the National Museum of Nature and Science prepared for researching the ecology of Iriomote cats, and in November 1973 the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] conducted a joint preliminary investigation regarding the cat's ecology,&lt;ref name=Ministry_environment /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; and from 1974 the Ministry of the Environment conducted a comprehensive investigation that lasted three years. After that, there were three more investigations beginning in 1982, 1992, and 2005.&lt;ref name=Ministry_environment /&gt;

In 1979, the EPA began a three-year-long feeding operation in order to increase the survival rate of kittens,&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt; but these actions have received some criticism.&lt;ref name=Ohara_2000 /&gt;

Since the Iriomote cat's discovery, various investigations have taken place. In 2006, automatic cameras and radio telemetry were used in order to understand the cats' state of life. Pathological tests regarding the contagiousness of diseases were also conducted, and tests on feces and food leftovers were also done. They also compiled records of cat sightings by locals and tourists.&lt;ref name=Wildlife_2006 /&gt;

Part of the Iriomote's cat range was designated as {{nihongo4|Iriomote Ryukyu Government Park|西表政府立公園|Iriomote Seifu-ritsu Kōen}} on April 18, 1972. With the [[History of the Ryukyu Islands#Post-war occupation|US's return of the Ryukyu Islands to Japanese control]] on May 15, it became [[Iriomote-Ishigaki National Park|Iriomote National Park]], and in March 1991 11,584.67 [[hectares]] of the island was designated the {{nihongo4|Iriomote Forest and Ecological Preserve|西表島森林生態系保護地域|Iriomote-jima Shinrin Seitaikei Hogo Chiiki}} in order to protect the natural environment within the area's confines.&lt;ref name=Ministry_basic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/park/iriomote/intro/basis.html |script-title=ja:西表石垣国立公園　基礎情報 |author=環境省 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Iriomote-Ishigaki National Park: Basic Information |accessdate=10 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120044938/http://www.env.go.jp/park/iriomote/intro/basis.html |archivedate=20 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kyushu_forest&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rinya.maff.go.jp/kyusyu/okinawa/sinrinkanrisyo/hogotiiki/index.html |script-title=ja:西表島森林生態系保護地域（保全利用地区・保存地区） |author=九州森林管理局 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Iriomote Forest and Ecological Preserve (Complete Area, Preservation Area) Information |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these efforts, not enough land within the cats' preferred habitat of 200 meters below sea level was included. In 1995 the {{nihongo4|Iriomote Wildlife Preservation Center|西表野生生物保護センター|Iriomote Yaseisei Seibutsu Hogo Sentā}} was established to increase preservation work, enforce research, and to increase understanding of the cats.&lt;ref name=Center /&gt;

[[File:Zebra zone at iriomote.jpg|thumb|right|"Zebra zone" strips and inclined ditches on an Iriomote road]]
Since the US returned control of the Ryukyu Islands to Japan in 1972, development on Iriomote continued with finances from the Okinawan mainland. In 1977, a prefectural road was built that circles half of the island, which has led to a few Iriomote cat deaths every year due to traffic accidents.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt; The Ministry of the Environment as well as the governments of Okinawa and Taketomi Town began installing road signs to warn people of Iriomote cats, tunnels beneath the road for animals' safe crossing, zebra zones which create loud noises when cars ride over them, wide ditches on the sides of roads, and ditches on the side of the road that are inclined on one side in order to improve the preservation of the cats.&lt;ref name=Center /&gt;&lt;ref name=Protect_cats&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iwcc.a.la9.jp/iwcc.htm |title=イリオモテヤマネコを守る！～IWCCの取り組み |author=西表野生生物保護センター |language=Japanese |trans-title=Protect the Iriomote Cats! ~IWCC's Efforts |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many residents have objected to restrictions on land cultivation and improvement brought about by the measures in place to protect the Iriomote cat and other species on the island.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt;

===In captivity===
There have been a handful of Iriomote cats kept in captivity. A five-week-old male kitten that had been separated from its mother was found on June 14, 1979. He was named Keita and was kept at the [[Okinawa Zoo]] until he died of old age at approximately thirteen years and two months of age.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt; A female specimen was also kept at the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]]. She was believed to have been approximately nine years and seven months old when she died.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt; On August 6, 1996, a male kitten that would later be known as Yon was taken into care at the Iriomote Wildlife Protection Center after being involved in a traffic accident.&lt;ref name=Yon_death /&gt;

===Yon===

====Discovery and hospitalization====
[[File:Iriomote yamaneko-yon.jpg|thumb|right|The taxidermied body of "Yon". He was hit by a car on August 6, 1996 then rehabilitated at the Iriomote Wildlife Conservation Center. He died on April 9, 2011 at the estimated age of fifteen years and one month, the longest confirmed lifespan of any Iriomote cat.&lt;ref name=Yon_death /&gt;]]
On August 6, 1996, a young Iriomote cat was involved in a traffic accident near Nadara Bridge on the northern part of the island. He weighed 1.6 kilograms and was assumed to have been born in early March, making him about five months old. It is possible that he had just been separated from his mother. The next morning he had regained consciousness, but he wasn't able to regulate his body temperature due to the serious injuries he received. He was transferred to Ishigaki Island at 9 am to receive medical care at Ishigaki Veterinary Clinic. He spent 24 days under their care.&lt;ref name=Yon&gt;{{cite book |last=西表野生生物保護センター |title=W-48: イリオモテヤマネコよんの歩み |language=Japanese |trans-title=W-48: Yon the Iriomote Cat's Progress |type=brochure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the accident he couldn't move on his own, but he regained his ability to walk while on Ishigaki. He was brought back to the Iriomote Wildlife Preservation Center for rehabilitation on August 31. Originally labeled W-48 due to the fact that he was the forty-eighth confirmed sighting of an Iriomote cat on the western part of the island, he eventually was given the name Yon.&lt;ref name=Yon /&gt;

====Rehabilitation====
By September 2, Yon weighed 1.9 kilograms. Despite his progress, his caretakers noticed a tendency for him to turn to the right because of the effects of his accident.&lt;ref name=Yon /&gt;

From the beginning, Yon's caretakers took careful measures in order to avoid acclimation to humans so that one day he could be released back into the wild. Only three staff members were allowed to feed him directly. Other people, including center staff, were only allowed to view him via video camera monitoring. The media were also prohibited from taking direct photographs.&lt;ref name=Yon /&gt;

From the time he was discharged until February 3, 1999 Yon's rehabilitation was restricted to a room within the center. Thin logs were used to make a jungle gym so that he would be able to practice walking, jumping, and climbing trees. Rice plants were also grown in his room as a substitute for grass that cats use to help regurgitate. Once he was healthy enough, he was moved to an outdoor cage where he lived until his health began deteriorating on December 20, 2010.&lt;ref name=Yon /&gt;

He was permanently handicapped after his accident; his left paw was paralyzed, and he tended to move towards the right.&lt;ref name=Yon /&gt;

====Death====
On December 20, 2010 Yon was found to be curled up and unmoving near a dried stream. He was brought into the center's rehabilitation room, where it was discovered that he had [[pulmonary edema]], which had nearly killed him; however, he was able to eat by the next day and gradually got better. He was unable to walk for the remainder of December, though by the end of January he had regained this ability and, during February and March, he improved enough to be able to walk up and down stairs. However, his condition then took a turn for the worse, and he died on the night of April 9 at an estimated fifteen years and one month old. He weighed 3.5 kilograms and was 78.5 centimeters long. He is the oldest Iriomote cat on record.&lt;ref name=Yon /&gt;

====Influence on research====
Yon was the first Iriomote cat to be kept for an extended period of time, the only to be saved after an accident, and the first to go through rehabilitation. Other Iriomote cats that were rescued either died immediately or shortly after being brought in for care.&lt;ref name=Yon /&gt;

Though he was never returned to the wild, the recorded observations of Yon are extremely important regarding Iriomote cat preservation. Every day, records were taken including what he did at what time, weight, and anything else of note. Because of difficulties in researching Iriomote cats in the wild, observations of Yon are currently the best example of the cats' natural behavior. There are also very few cases of the cats being cared for by people, so records of his health care may help injured and sick Iriomote cats in the future.&lt;ref name=Yon /&gt;

==In culture==
On July 30, 2010, the [[Taketomi, Okinawa|Taketomi]] Town Tourist Association invited residents to create a design for a local mascot. A Komi Elementary School sixth grader's design, which was based on the Iriomote cat, was chosen. The island of Iriomote, where Taketomi is located, is pictured on the mascot's chest. It was named in the same manner it was designed; on August 31, 2010 the name {{nihongo|"Pikaryaa"|ピカリャ～}} was chosen based on the submission of an Ishigaki resident who drew inspiration from the local nickname of the cat, ''yamapikaryaa''.&lt;ref name=Pikarya_name&gt;{{cite web |url=http://painusima.com/t10namaebosyu.htm |script-title=ja:竹富町マスコットキャラクター　名前が決定しました！ |author=竹富町観光協会 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Taketomi's Mascot's Name is Picked! |accessdate=10 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909153854/http://painusima.com/t10namaebosyu.htm |archivedate=9 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yamapikaryaa==
In general, names such as ''yamapikaryaa'' are used in reference to the Iriomote cat, but some locals claim to have seen another type of cat on the island. This cat is described as being twice as large as a house cat with a tail that is 60 centimeters long and a coat pattern that is different from what the Iriomote cat displays. It has been sighted several times.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-8-13-144-147 /&gt; Locals have given it several nicknames. In the neighborhoods of Sonai and Komi they call it {{nihongo3||クンズマヤー|kunzumayaa}} and {{nihongo3||トウトウヤー|toutouyaa}}, respectively, and on Aragusu Island they call it {{nihongo3||ヤマピカリャー|yamapikaryaa}}. It is not thought to be a house cat, stray cat, or an Iriomote cat.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-8-13-144-147 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Okinawa_museum&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museums.pref.okinawa.jp/museum/issue/report/image/iriomote/Iriomote4.pdf |script-title=ja:西表島総合調査報告書 |author=沖縄県立博物館 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Report on Comprehensive Survey of Iriomote Island |format=PDF |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Togawa spoke with a local hunter who claimed to have killed a large cat with fur like a tiger's. He disposed of the body, and Haemi on the southern part of the island, where the body was disposed of, was searched.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-93-138 /&gt; The hunter said that, until ten days prior to the interview, the cat's skeleton was still where he had left it, but the recent rains had washed it away.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-93-138 /&gt; He described that cat as having a shoulder height that reached an adult human's knee, a tail that was 60 centimeters long, a body twice as large as a house cat's, and greenish striped fur.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-93-138 /&gt;

On June 2, 1982 the [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] published an article about ''yamapikaryaa''. An experienced boar hunter claimed to have seen yamapikaryaa about ten times in the mountains around Mount Dedou. He also said that he caught and ate one once. On another occasion, he said he saw an adult female yamapikaryaa with a kitten.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-8-13-144-147 /&gt;

Other articles regarding ''yamapikaryaa'' have also been published, including on September 14, 2007. Professor {{nihongo4|Eiyuu Akiyoshi|秋吉英雄|Akiyoshi Eiyuu}} of [[Shimane University]], who was staying on Iriomote in order to research fish, spotted a cat larger than the Iriomote cat with a long tail and spots. He saw the cat on {{nihongo4|Sakiyama Peninsula|崎山半島|Sakiyama Hantō}} on the seldom-visited western part of the island.&lt;ref name=Yamapikarya&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ryukyushimpo.jp/news/storyid-30074-storytopic-5.html |script-title=ja:伝説の生物「ヤマピカリャー」？　西表で目撃相次ぐ |author=琉球新報 |language=Japanese |trans-title=The Legendary "Yamapikaryaa"? One Sighting After Another on Iriomote Island |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo4|Tadaaki Imaizumi|今泉忠明|Imaizumi Tadaaki}}, on the other hand, spoke with a hunter in 1994 who had the skull of what he believed was a large wild cat. Tadaaki Imaizumi determined that it was a house cat.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-8-13-144-147 /&gt;

'''Kindness priming''' 
&lt;!--- Write your article below this line ---&gt;
is an affect-dependent cognitive effect in which subjects will display a [[positive affect]] following exposure to [[kindness]].

==Background ==

Kindness priming refers to the observed effect by which individuals who are exposed to an act of kindness – the priming – subsequently notice more of the positive features of the world than they would otherwise. A person receiving a free voucher from a stranger, for example, may become more inclined to perceive the intentions of others around them as good.

Some researchers hypothosize that kindness priming involves the same cognitive circuitry that enables memory priming. By activating neural representations of positive affect, an act of kindness stimulates increased activity in related associative networks. It is therefore more likely that subsequent stimuli will activate these related, positive networks, and so the positive affect continues to be carried forward in a [[Feedforward neural network|feed forward]] manner. Additionally, kindness priming has also been shown to inoculate against negative stimuli in the short term,&lt;ref name=T&amp;F&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teasdale|last2=Fogarty|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/abn/88/3/248/|title=Differential effects of induced mood on retrieval of pleasant and unpleasant events from episodic memory|year=1979|doi=10.1037/0021-843X.88.3.248|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|volume=88|issue=3|pages=248–257}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus temporarily improving an individual's [[Psychological resilience|resilience]].

== Effects ==
To measure the effects of kindness priming, investigators typically generate an experimental paradigm measuring behavioral reactions and cognitive self-reports. Often these tests include evaluation of additional effective primes, such as hostility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Neuberg|url=http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/soco.1988.6.3.207|title=Behavioral Implications of Information Presented Outside of Conscious Awareness: The Effect of Subliminal Presentation of Trait Information on Behavior in the Prisoner's Dilemma Game|year=1988|doi=10.1521/soco.1988.6.3.207|journal=Social Cognition|volume=6|number=3|pages=207–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stapel&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stapel|url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/31/9/1286.full.pdf+html|title=When Less Is More: The Consequences of Effective Primacy for Subliminal Priming Effects|year=2005|doi=10.1177/0146167205275616|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=31|number=9|pages=1286–1295}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, subjects are exposed to an effective prime or act of kindness, such as being given a box of candy,&lt;ref name=stapel /&gt;&lt;ref name=carlson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carlson|last2=Charlin|last3=Norman|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/55/2/211/|title=Positive mood and helping behavior: A test of six hypotheses|year=1989|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=55|issue=2|pages=211–229|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.55.2.211}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently given introspective tests measuring cognitive traits like affect, memory, learning, or attention.&lt;ref name=T&amp;F /&gt; Some experiments include a behavioral observation instead, and often utilize paradigms from memory studies, such as learning time, reaction time, target identification, recall,&lt;ref name=carlson /&gt; and word generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gohier|displayauthors=etal|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092493381100112X|title=Gender differences in the sensitivity to negative stimuli: Cross-modal affective priming study, 2011|doi=10.1016/j.eurpsy.2011.06.007|journal=European Psychology|volume=28|issue=2|pages=74–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempt to identify kindness priming was derivative of a memory experiment performed by Teasdale and Fogarty in 1979. In their experiment, two mood states, happy and depressed, were generated in the participants at different trials. Participants were then presented with stimulus of either happy or sad emotional valence, and subsequently asked to recall the presented items. This study showed that in the happy state, participants were more likely to recall the happy stimuli, and vice versa for the depressed state.&lt;ref name=T&amp;F /&gt;

== Hypothesis ==
Some researchers believe that kindness priming operates similarly to associative memories, and thus utilizes common neurological mechanisms.{{Such as?}} Teasdale and Fogarty were the first to hypothesize that affect led to differences in learning speed and memory retrieval, on the bases of congruent valence of mood and target material via common associations.{{Such as?}}&lt;ref name=T&amp;F /&gt; Later, it was presumed that humans store material (including affect) in memory that later acts as cues for associative networks in the presence of novel environmental stimuli.&lt;ref name=stapel /&gt;&lt;ref name=carlson /&gt; These associative hypotheses were then refined to exclude opposing stimuli: specifically, Clark and Waddell postulated that the positive affect primed by acts of kindness causes a positive cognitive bias that leaves the subject relatively immune to "unambiguously unpleasant stimuli".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Clark Waddell|jstor=3033658|title=Effects of Moods on Thoughts About Helping, Attraction and Information Acquisition|doi=10.2307/3033658|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|volume=46|number=1|pages=31–35|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Kindness priming is similar to general [[affect priming]] and thus has similar applications. In the field of [[positive psychology]], kindness priming is a valuable tool for spreading positive affect in a feed forward cycle. By inducing a positive mood in others, and immunizing them against negative stimuli, it is believed that they will feel compelled to produce acts of kindness for others, propagating the effects.&lt;ref name=stapel /&gt; This spread of positive affect and increased resilience is in line with the goals of positive psychology and recommended therein to be pursued alongside loving-kindness meditation to improve general well-being. Marketing researchers have capitalized on kindness priming, as corporate studies{{citation needed|reason=Studies are invoked in the argument but not proffered in reference.|date=September 2014}} have shown it may increase a subject's valence toward a brand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4693">The '''law of specific nerve energies''', first proposed by [[Johannes Peter Müller]] in 1835, is that the nature of perception is defined by the pathway over which the sensory information is carried.  Hence, the origin of the sensation is not important. Therefore, the difference in perception of seeing, hearing, and touch are not caused by differences in the stimuli themselves but by the different nervous structures that these stimuli excite. For example, pressing on the [[human eye|eye]] elicits sensations of flashes of [[light]] because the [[neuron]]s in the [[retina]] send a signal to the [[occipital lobe]]. Despite the sensory input's being mechanical, the experience is visual.

==Quotation==

Here is Müller's statement of the law, from ''Handbuch der Physiologie des Menschen für Vorlesungen'', 2nd Ed., translated by Edwin Clarke and Charles Donald O'Malley:
::''The same cause, such as electricity, can simultaneously affect all sensory organs, since they are all sensitive to it; and yet, every sensory nerve reacts to it differently; one nerve perceives it as light, another hears its sound, another one smells it; another tastes the electricity, and another one feels it as pain and shock. One nerve perceives a luminous picture through mechanical irritation, another one hears it as buzzing, another one senses it as pain. . . He who feels compelled to consider the consequences of these facts cannot but realize that the specific sensibility of nerves for certain impressions is not enough, since all nerves are sensitive to the same cause but react to the same cause in different ways. . . (S)ensation is not the conduction of a quality or state of external bodies to consciousness, but the conduction of a quality or state of our nerves to consciousness, excited by an external cause.''

==Clarification==

As the above quotation shows, Müller's law seems to differ from the modern statement of the law in one key way. Müller attributed the [[quale|quality]] of an experience to some specific quality of the energy in the nerves. For example, the visual experience from light shining into the eye, or from a poke in the eye, arises from some special quality of the energy carried by [[optic nerve]], and the auditory experience from sound coming into the ear, or from electrical stimulation of the [[cochlea]], arises from some different, special quality of the energy carried by the [[auditory nerve]]. In 1912, [[Lord Edgar Douglas Adrian]] showed that all neurons carry the same energy, electrical energy in the form of [[action potential]]s. That means that the quality of an experience depends on the part of the brain to which nerves deliver their action potentials (e.g., light from nerves arriving at the [[visual cortex]] and sound from nerves arriving at the [[auditory cortex]]).

In 1945, [[Roger Sperry]] showed that it is the location in the brain to which nerves attach that determines experience. He studied [[amphibian]]s whose optic nerves cross completely, so that the left eye connects to the right side of the brain and the right eye connects to the left side of the brain. He was able to cut the optic nerves and cause them to regrow on the opposite side of the brain so that the left eye now connected to the left side of the brain and the right eye connected to the right side of the brain. He then showed that these animals made the opposite movements from the ones they would have made before the operation. For example, before the operation, the animal would move to the left to get away from a large object approaching from the right. After the operation, the animal would move to the right in response to the same large object approaching from the right. Sperry showed similar results in other animals including [[mammal]]s ([[rat]]s), this work contributing to his [[Nobel Prize]] in 1981.

Biases have a variety of forms and appear as cognitive ("cold") bias, such as mental noise,&lt;ref name="HilbertPsychBull" /&gt; or motivational ("hot") bias, such as when beliefs are distorted by [[wishful thinking]]. Both effects can be present at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.259 |last=Maccoun |first=Robert J. |year=1998|title=Biases in the interpretation and use of research results |journal=Annual Review of Psychology|pmid=15012470 |volume=49 |pages=259–87 |url=http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~maccoun/MacCoun_AnnualReview98.pdf |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nickerson |first=Raymond S. |authorlink=Raymond S.

There are also controversies over some of these biases as to whether they count as useless or [[irrationality|irrational]], or whether they result in useful attitudes or behavior. For example, when getting to know others, people tend to ask [[leading question]]s which seem biased towards confirming their assumptions about the person. However, this kind of [[confirmation bias]] has also been argued to be an example of [[social skills|social skill]]: a way to establish a connection with the other person.&lt;ref name="dardenne"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dardenne |first=Benoit |first2=Jacques-Philippe |last2=Leyens|title=Confirmation Bias as a Social Skill |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=1995 |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=1229–1239 |doi=10.1177/01461672952111011|issn=1552-7433|url=http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/handle/2268/28639 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this research overwhelmingly involves human subjects, some findings that demonstrate bias have been found in non-human animals as well. For example, [[hyperbolic discounting]] has been observed in rats, pigeons, and monkeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alexander|first=William H.|author2=Brown, Joshua W. |title=Hyperbolically Discounted Temporal Difference Learning|journal=Neural Computation|date=1 June 2010|volume=22|issue=6|pages=1511–1527|doi=10.1162/neco.2010.08-09-1080|pmc=3005720|pmid=20100071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision-making, belief, and behavioral biases==
Many of these biases affect belief formation, business and economic decisions, and human behavior in general.

| [[Gambler's fallacy]]
| The tendency to think that future probabilities are altered by past events, when in reality they are unchanged. The fallacy arises from an erroneous conceptualization of the [[law of large numbers]]. For example, "I've flipped heads with this coin five times consecutively, so the chance of tails coming out on the sixth flip is much greater than heads."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamblersfallacy.asp|title=Gambler's Fallacy/Monte Carlo Fallacy|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2006-10-29|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memory errors and biases==
{{main|List of memory biases}}
In [[psychology]] ''and'' [[cognitive science]], a memory bias is a [[cognitive bias]] that either enhances or impairs the recall of a [[memory]] (either the chances that the memory will be recalled at all, or the amount of time it takes for it to be recalled, or both), or that alters the content of a reported memory. There are many types of memory bias, including:

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col" style="width:25%;"| Name
! scope="col" style="width:75%;"| Description
|-
| [[Bizarreness effect]]
| Bizarre material is better remembered than common material.
|-
| [[Choice-supportive bias]]
| In a self-justifying manner retroactively ascribing one's choices to be more informed than they were when they were made.
|-
| {{vanchor|Change bias}}
| After an investment of effort in producing change, remembering one's past performance as more difficult than it actually was.&lt;ref name="schacter" /&gt;{{unreliable source? |date=October 2013}}&lt;!-- Judging by searches on Google Books Change Bias does not seem to be a "thing". It just a generic name given to various phenomena.--&gt;
|-
| [[Childhood amnesia]]
| The retention of few memories from before the age of four.
|-
| {{vanchor|Conservatism}} or Regressive bias
| Tendency to remember high values and high likelihoods/probabilities/frequencies as lower than they actually were and low ones as higher than they actually were. Based on the evidence, memories are not extreme enough.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Experimental Psychology 1523" /&gt;
|-
| {{vanchor|Consistency bias}}
|Incorrectly remembering one's past attitudes and behaviour as resembling present attitudes and behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cacioppo |first=John |title=Foundations in social neuroscience |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=2002 |isbn=978-0262531955 |pages=130–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| [[cue-dependent forgetting|Context effect]]
| That cognition and memory are dependent on context, such that out-of-context memories are more difficult to retrieve than in-context memories (e.g., recall time and accuracy for a work-related memory will be lower at home, and vice versa).
|-
| [[Cross-race effect]]
| The tendency for people of one race to have difficulty identifying members of a race other than their own.
|-
| [[Cryptomnesia]]
| A form of [[Misattribution of memory|''misattribution'']] where a memory is mistaken for imagination, because there is no subjective experience of it being a memory.&lt;ref name="schacter"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schacter|first= Daniel L. |year=1999|title=The Seven Sins of Memory: Insights From Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience|journal=American Psychologist|volume=54|issue=3 |pages=182–203|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.54.3.182|pmid=10199218}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| [[Egocentric bias]]
| Recalling the past in a self-serving manner, e.g., remembering one's exam grades as being better than they were, or remembering a caught fish as bigger than it really was.
|-
| [[Fading affect bias]]
| A bias in which the emotion associated with unpleasant memories fades more quickly than the emotion associated with positive events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=W.

Thompson |year=1994|title=Effects of Humor on Sentence Memory|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|volume=20|issue=4|pages=953–967|url=http://facstaff.uww.edu/eamond/road/Research/GenderJokes%28DK1%29/References%20and%20info/Effects%20of%20Humor%20on%20Sentence%20Memory.pdf|accessdate=2015-04-19|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.20.4.953 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| [[False memory]]
| A form of ''misattribution'' where imagination is mistaken for a memory.
|-
| [[Generation effect]] (Self-generation effect)
| That self-generated information is remembered best. For instance, people are better able to recall memories of statements that they have generated than similar statements generated by others.
|-
| [[Google effect]]
| The tendency to forget information that can be found readily online by using Internet search engines.
|-
| [[Hindsight bias]]
| The inclination to see past events as being more predictable than they actually were; also called the "I-knew-it-all-along" effect.
|-
| {{vanchor|Humor effect}}
| That humorous items are more easily remembered than non-humorous ones, which might be explained by the distinctiveness of humor, the increased cognitive processing time to understand the humor, or the emotional arousal caused by the humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Schmidt|first=Stephen R. |year=2003|title=Life Is Pleasant—and Memory Helps to Keep It That Way!|journal=Review of General Psychology|volume=7|issue=2|pages=203–210|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.7.2.203 |url=http://www.niu.edu/jskowronski/publications/WalkerSkowronskiThompson2003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| [[Illusion of truth effect]]
| That people are more likely to identify as true statements those they have previously heard (even if they cannot consciously remember having heard them), regardless of the actual validity of the statement. In other words, a person is more likely to believe a familiar statement than an unfamiliar one.
|-
| [[Illusory correlation]]
| Inaccurately remembering a relationship between two events.&lt;ref name="HilbertPsychBull" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;
|-
| Lag effect
| The phenomenon whereby learning is greater when studying is spread out over time, as opposed to studying the same amount of time in a single session. See also [[spacing effect]].
|-
| [[Leveling and sharpening]]
| Memory distortions introduced by the loss of details in a recollection over time, often concurrent with sharpening or selective recollection of certain details that take on exaggerated significance in relation to the details or aspects of the experience lost through leveling. Both biases may be reinforced over time, and by repeated recollection or re-telling of a memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koriat |first=A. |author2=M. Goldsmith |author3=A.

|-
| [[Levels-of-processing effect]]
| That different methods of encoding information into memory have different levels of effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Craik &amp; Lockhart, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| {{vanchor|List-length effect}}
| A smaller percentage of items are remembered in a longer list, but as the length of the list increases, the absolute number of items remembered increases as well. For example, consider a list of 30 items ("L30") and a list of 100 items ("L100"). An individual may remember 15 items from L30, or 50%, whereas the individual may remember 40 items from L100, or 40%. Although the percent of L30 items remembered (50%) is greater than the percent of L100 (40%), more L100 items (40) are remembered than L30 items (15).&lt;ref name=memcog&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kinnell |first1=Angela |last2=Dennis |first2=S. |date=2011 |title=The list length effect in recognition memory: an analysis of potential confounds |journal=Memory &amp; Cognition |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=348–63 |doi=10.3758/s13421-010-0007-6|pmid=21264573 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Further explanation needed|date=November 2013}}

A 2012 ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]'' article suggested that at least eight seemingly unrelated biases can be produced by the same [[information-theoretic]] generative mechanism that assumes noisy information processing during storage and retrieval of information in human memory.&lt;ref name="HilbertPsychBull"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Martin Hilbert|year=2012|url=http://www.martinhilbert.net/HilbertPsychBull.pdf|layurl=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2011-27261-001|title=Toward a synthesis of cognitive biases: How noisy information processing can bias human decision making|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=138|issue=2|pages= 211–237|doi=10.1037/a0025940|pmid=22122235|citeseerx=10.1.1.432.8763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual differences in decision making biases==
People do appear to have stable individual differences in their susceptibility to decision biases such as [[Overconfidence effect|overconfidence]], [[temporal discounting]], and [[bias blind spot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bias Blind Spot: Structure, Measurement, and Consequences|journal = Management Science|date = 2015-04-24|doi = 10.1287/mnsc.2014.2096|first = Irene|last = Scopelliti|first2 = Carey K.|last2 = Morewedge|first3 = Erin|last3 = McCormick|first4 = H. Lauren|last4 = Min|first5 = Sophie|last5 = Lebrecht|first6 = Karim S.|last6 = Kassam|volume=61|issue = 10|pages=2468–2486}}&lt;/ref&gt; That said, these stable levels of bias within individuals are possible to change. Participants in experiments who watched training videos and played debiasing games showed medium to large reductions both immediately and up to three months later in the extent to which they exhibited susceptibility to six cognitive biases: [[anchoring]], bias blind spot, [[confirmation bias]], [[fundamental attribution error]], [[projection bias]], and [[Representativeness heuristic|representativeness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Debiasing Decisions Improved Decision Making With a Single Training Intervention|url = http://bbs.sagepub.com/content/2/1/129|journal = Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date = 2015-10-01|issn = 2372-7322|pages = 129–140|volume = 2|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/2372732215600886|first = Carey K.|last = Morewedge|first2 = Haewon|last2 = Yoon|first3 = Irene|last3 = Scopelliti|first4 = Carl W.|last4 = Symborski|first5 = James H.|last5 = Korris|first6 = Karim S.|last6 = Kassam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debiasing==
[[Debiasing]] is the reduction of biases in judgment and decision making through incentives, nudges, and training. [[Cognitive bias mitigation]] and [[cognitive bias modification]] are forms of debiasing specifically applicable to cognitive biases and their effects. [[Reference class forecasting]] is a method for systematically debiasing estimates and decisions, based on what [[Daniel Kahneman]] has dubbed the [[outside view]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44966">In the [[philosophy of language]], the nature of '''meaning''', its [[definition]], elements, and types, was discussed by [[philosophers]] [[Aristotle]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], and [[Aquinas]]. According to them "meaning is a relationship between two sorts of things: ''signs'' and the kinds of things they ''mean'' (intend, express or signify)". One term in the relationship of meaning necessarily causes something else to come to the mind. In other words: "a sign is defined as an [[entity]] that indicates another entity to some agent for some purpose". As Augustine states, a sign is "something that shows itself to the senses and something other than itself to the mind" (''Signum est quod se ipsum sensui et praeter se aliquid animo ostendit''; ''De dial.'', 1975, 86).

The types of meanings vary according to the types of the thing that is being represented. Namely:
# There are the things in the world, which might have meaning;
# There are things in the world that are also signs of other things in the world, and so, are always meaningful (i.e., natural signs of the physical world and ideas within the mind);
# There are things that are always necessarily meaningful, such as words, and other nonverbal symbols.

All subsequent inquiries emphasize some particular perspectives within the general AAA framework.

The major contemporary positions of meaning come under the following partial definitions of meaning:
*''Psychological theories'', exhausted by notions of [[thought]], [[intention]], or [[understanding]];
*''Logical theories'', involving notions such as [[intension]], cognitive content, or [[sense]], along with [[Extension (semantics)|extension]], reference, or denotation;
*Message, content, [[information]], or [[communication]];
*[[Truth]] conditions;
*Usage, and the instructions for usage; and
*[[Measurement]], computation, or operation.

==Truth and meaning==
{{main|Truth}}
The evaluation of meaning according to each one of the five major substantive theories of meaning and truth is presented below. The question of what is a proper basis for deciding how words, symbols, ideas and beliefs may properly be considered to truthfully denote meaning, whether by a single person or an entire society, is dealt with by the five most prevalent substantive theories listed below. Each theory of meaning as evaluated by these respective theories of truth are each further researched by the individual scholars supporting each one of the respective theories of truth and meaning.&lt;ref name="EPT"&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Supp., "Truth", auth: Michael Williams, p572-573 (Macmillan, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Simon, and Simmons, Keith (eds., 1999), ''Truth'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK. Includes papers by James, Ramsey, Russell, Tarski, and more recent work.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor1-last = Hale | editor1-first = Bob| editor2-first = Crispin | chapter = A Companion to the Philosophy of Language | doi = 10.1111/b.9780631213260.1999.00015.x | pages = 309–330 | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780631213260 | pmid =  | pmc = | editor2-last = Wright | title = A Companion to the Philosophy of Language}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both hybrid theories of meaning and alternative theories of meaning and truth have also been researched, and are subject to further assessment according to their respective and relative merits.&lt;ref name = EPT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horwich, Paul, ''Truth'', (2nd edition, 1988),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Field, Hartry, ''Truth and the Absence of Fact'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substantive theories of meaning===

====Correspondence theory====
Correspondence theories emphasise that true beliefs and true statements of meaning correspond to the actual state of affairs and that associated meanings must be in agreement with these beliefs and statements.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth: Arthur N. Prior, p223 (Macmillan, 1969) Prior uses [[Bertrand Russell|Bertrand Russell's]] wording in defining correspondence theory. According to Prior, Russell was substantially responsible for helping to make correspondence theory widely known under this name.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of theory stresses a relationship between thoughts or statements on one hand, and things or objects on the other. It is a traditional model tracing its origins to [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosophers such as [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223-224 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; This class of theories holds that the truth or the falsity of a representation is determined in principle entirely by how it relates to "things", by whether it accurately describes those "things." An example of correspondence theory is the statement by the Thirteenth Century philosopher/theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]]: ''Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus'' ("Truth is the equation [or adequation] of things and intellect"), a statement which Aquinas attributed to the Ninth Century [[neoplatonist]] [[Isaac Israeli ben Solomon|Isaac Israeli]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth: Arthur N. Prior, p224, Macmillan, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence "Correspondence Theory of Truth", in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/index.html Summa], [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1.htm I], [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1016.htm Q.16], [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1016.htm#article2 A.2]&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas also restated the theory as: "A judgment is said to be true when it conforms to the external reality"&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence "Correspondence Theory of Truth", in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy], (citing De Veritate Q.1, A.1&amp;3; cf. Summa Theologiae Q.16).&lt;/ref&gt;

Correspondence theory centres heavily around the assumption that truth and meaning are a matter of accurately copying what is known as "[[objective reality]]" and then representing it in thoughts, words and other symbols.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' Bradley, F.H., "On Truth and Copying", in Blackburn, ''et al.'' (eds., 1999),''Truth'', 31-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern theorists have stated that this ideal cannot be achieved without analysing additional factors.&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223 ''ff''. Macmillan, 1969. See especially, section on "Moore's Correspondence Theory", 225-226, "Russell's Correspondence Theory", 226-227, "Ramsey and Later Wittgenstein", 228-229, "Tarski's Semantic Theory", 230-231.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, language plays a role in that all languages have words to represent concepts that are virtually undefined in other languages. The [[German language|German]] word ''[[Zeitgeist]]'' is one such example: one who speaks or understands the language may "know" what it means, but any translation of the word apparently fails to accurately capture its full meaning (this is a problem with many abstract words, especially those derived in [[agglutinative languages]]). Thus, some words add an additional parameter to the construction of an accurate [[truth predicate]]. Among the philosophers who grappled with this problem is [[Alfred Tarski]], whose [[semantic theory of truth|semantic theory]] is summarized further below in this article.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth: Arthur N. Prior, p. 223 ''ff''. Macmillan, 1969). See the section on "Tarski's Semantic Theory", 230-231.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coherence theory====
For coherence theories in general, the assessment of meaning and truth requires a proper fit of elements within a whole system. Very often, though, coherence is taken to imply something more than simple logical consistency; often there is a demand that the propositions in a coherent system lend mutual inferential support to each other. So, for example, the completeness and comprehensiveness of the underlying set of concepts is a critical factor in judging the validity and usefulness of a coherent system.&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant]], for instance, assembled a controversial but quite coherent system in the early 19th century, whose validity of meaning and usefulness continues to be debated even today. Similarly, the systems of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Spinoza]] are characteristic systems that are internally coherent but controversial in terms of their utility and validity.&lt;/ref&gt;  A pervasive tenet of coherence theories is the idea that truth is primarily a property of whole systems of propositions, and can be ascribed to individual propositions only according to their coherence with the whole.  Among the assortment of perspectives commonly regarded as coherence theory, theorists differ on the question of whether coherence entails many possible true systems of thought or only a single absolute system.

Some variants of coherence theory are claimed to describe the essential and intrinsic properties of [[formal system]]s in logic and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Coherence Theory of Truth", auth: Alan R. White, p130-131 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, formal reasoners are content to contemplate [[independence (mathematical logic)|axiomatically independent]] and sometimes mutually contradictory systems side by side, for example, the various [[noneuclidean geometry|alternative geometries]]. On the whole, coherence theories have been rejected for lacking justification in their application to other areas of truth, especially with respect to assertions about the [[Natural environment|natural world]], [[empirical]] data in general, assertions about practical matters of psychology and society, especially when used without support from the other major theories of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Coherence Theory of Truth", auth: Alan R. White, pp. 131–133, ''see'' esp., section on "Epistemological assumptions" (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Coherence theories distinguish the thought of [[rationalism|rationalist]] philosophers, particularly of [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], and [[G.W.F. Hegel]], along with the British philosopher [[F.H. Bradley]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Coherence Theory of Truth", auth: Alan R. White, p130&lt;/ref&gt; Other alternatives may be found among several proponents of [[logical positivism]], notably [[Otto Neurath]] and [[Carl Hempel]].

====Constructivist theory====
{{Main|Constructivist epistemology}}

[[Constructivist epistemology|Social constructivism]] holds that meaning and truth are constructed by social processes, is historically and culturally specific, and that it is in part shaped through the power struggles within a community. Constructivism views all of our knowledge as "constructed," because it does not reflect any external "transcendent" realities (as a pure correspondence theory might hold).  Rather, perceptions of truth are viewed as contingent on convention, human perception, and social experience. It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality, including [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], and [[gender]], are socially constructed.

[[Giambattista Vico]] was among the first to claim that history and culture along with their meaning were man-made. Vico's [[epistemology|epistemological]] orientation gathers the most diverse rays and unfolds in one axiom{{spaced ndash}}''verum ipsum factum''{{spaced ndash}}"truth itself is constructed". [[Hegel]] and [[Marx]] were among the other early proponents of the premise that truth is, or can be, socially constructed. Marx, like  many critical theorists who followed, did not reject the existence of objective truth but rather distinguished between true knowledge and knowledge that has been distorted through power or ideology. For Marx, scientific and true knowledge is "in accordance with the dialectical understanding of history" and ideological knowledge is "an epiphenomenal expression of the relation of material forces in a given economic arrangement".&lt;ref&gt;May, Todd, 1993, Between Genealogy and Epistemology: Psychology, politics in the thought of Michel Foucault' with reference to Althusser and Balibar, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

====Consensus theory====
{{Main|Consensus theory of truth}}

[[Consensus theory of truth|Consensus theory]] holds that meaning and truth are whatever is agreed upon, or in some versions, might come to be agreed upon, by some specified group. Such a group might include all human beings, or a [[subset]] thereof consisting of more than one person.

Among the current advocates of consensus theory as a useful accounting of the concept of "truth" is  the philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]].&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Habermas, Jürgen, ''Knowledge and Human Interests'' (English translation, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas maintains that truth is what would be agreed upon in an [[ideal speech situation]].&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Habermas, Jürgen, ''Knowledge and Human Interests'' (English translation, 1972), esp. PART III, pp 187 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the current strong critics of consensus theory is the philosopher [[Nicholas Rescher]].&lt;ref&gt;Rescher, Nicholas, ''Pluralism: Against the Demand for Consensus'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pragmatic theory====
{{Main|Pragmatic theory of truth}}

The three most influential forms of the ''pragmatic theory of truth'' and meaning were introduced around the turn of the 20th century by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]].  Although there are wide differences in viewpoint among these and other proponents of pragmatic theory, they hold in common that meaning and truth are verified and confirmed by the results of putting one's concepts into practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.5, "Pragmatic Theory of Truth", 427 (Macmillan, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] defines truth as follows:  "Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief, which concordance the abstract statement may possess by virtue of the confession of its inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this confession is an essential ingredient of truth."&lt;ref name="Peirce Truth and Falsity"&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1901), "Truth and Falsity and Error" (in part), pp. 716–720 in [[James Mark Baldwin]], ed., ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'', v. 2. Peirce's section is entitled "''Logical''", beginning on p. 718, column 1, and ending on p. 720 with the initials "(C.S.P.)", see Google Books [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc8YAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA718 Eprint]. Reprinted, ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 5, pp. 565–573.&lt;/ref&gt; This statement stresses Peirce's view that ideas of approximation, incompleteness, and partiality, what he describes elsewhere as ''[[fallibilism]]'' and "reference to the future", are essential to a proper conception of meaning and truth.  Although Peirce uses words like ''concordance'' and ''correspondence'' to describe one aspect of the pragmatic [[sign relation]], he is also quite explicit in saying that definitions of truth based on mere correspondence are no more than ''nominal'' definitions, which he accords a lower status than ''real'' definitions.

[[William James|William James's]] version of pragmatic theory, while complex, is often summarized by his statement that "the 'true' is only the expedient in our way of thinking, just as the 'right' is only the expedient in our way of behaving."&lt;ref name=WJP&gt;James, William, ''The Meaning of Truth, A Sequel to 'Pragmatism','' (1909).&lt;/ref&gt;  By this, James meant that truth is a ''quality'', the value of which is confirmed by its effectiveness when applying concepts to practice (thus, "pragmatic").

[[John Dewey]], less broadly than James but  more broadly than Peirce, held that [[inquiry]], whether scientific, technical, sociological, philosophical or cultural, is self-corrective over time ''if''  openly submitted for testing by a community of inquirers in order to clarify, justify, refine and/or refute proposed meanings and truths.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Dewey, John", auth [[Richard J. Bernstein]], p383 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not widely known, a new variation of the pragmatic theory was defined and wielded successfully from the 20th century forward. Defined and named by [[William Ernest Hocking]], this variation is known as "negative pragmatism".  Essentially, what works may or may not be true, but what fails cannot be true because the truth and its meaning always works.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian, W.S. &amp; Sahakian, M.L., Ideas of the Great Philosophers, NEW YORK: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1966, LCCCN 66-23155&lt;/ref&gt; James and Dewey's ideas also ascribe meaning and truth to repeated testing which is "self-corrective" over time.

Pragmatism and negative pragmatism are also closely aligned with the [[coherence theory of truth]] in that any testing should not be isolated but rather incorporate knowledge from all human endeavors and experience.  The universe is a whole and integrated system, and testing should acknowledge and account for its diversity.  As Feynman said, "... if it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Feynman, ''The Character of Physical Law'', p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Associated theories and commentaries===
Some have asserted that meaning is nothing substantially more or less than the [[truth condition]]s they involve. For such theories, an emphasis is placed upon [[reference]] to actual things in the world to account for meaning, with the caveat that reference more or less explains the greater part (or all) of meaning itself.

====Logic and language====
The [[logical positivists]] argued that the meaning of a statement arose from [[The verifiability theory of meaning|how it is verified]].

====Gottlob Frege====
In his paper  ''Über Sinn und Bedeutung'' (now usually translated as ''On Sense and Reference''), [[Gottlob Frege]] argued that proper names present at least two problems in explaining meaning.

#Suppose the meaning of a name is the thing it refers to. ''Sam'', then, means a person in the world who is named Sam.  But if the object referred to by the name did not exist—i.e., ''Pegasus''—then, according to that theory, it would be meaningless.
#Suppose  two different names refer to the same object.  ''Hesperus'' and ''Phosphorus'' were the names given to what were considered distinct celestial bodies. It was later shown that they were the same thing (the planet Venus).  If the words meant the same thing, then substituting one for the other in a sentence would not result in a sentence that differs in meaning from the original.  But in that case, "Hesperus is Phosphorus" would mean the same thing as "Hesperus is Hesperus".  This is clearly absurd, since we learn something new and unobvious by the former statement, but not by the latter.

Frege can be interpreted as arguing that it was therefore a mistake to think that the meaning of a name is the thing it refers to.  Instead, the meaning must be something else&amp;mdash;the "sense" of the word.  Two names for the same person, then, can have different senses (or meanings): one referent might be picked out by more than one sense. This sort of theory is called a [[mediated reference theory]]. Frege argued that, ultimately, the same bifurcation of meaning must apply to most or all linguistic categories, such as to quantificational expressions like "All boats float".  It is now accepted by many philosophers {{who|date=May 2013}} as applying to all expressions ''but'' proper names .{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

====Bertrand Russell====
Logical analysis was further advanced by [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]  in their groundbreaking ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', which attempted to produce a formal language with which the truth of all mathematical statements could be demonstrated from first principles.

Russell differed from Frege greatly on many points, however.  He rejected Frege's sense-reference distinction. He also disagreed that language was of fundamental significance to philosophy, and saw the project of developing formal logic as a way of eliminating all of the confusions caused by ordinary language, and hence at creating a perfectly transparent medium in which to conduct traditional philosophical argument. He hoped, ultimately, to extend the proofs of the ''Principia'' to all possible true statements, a scheme he called [[logical atomism]]. For a while it appeared that his pupil [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] had succeeded in this plan with his "[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]".

Russell's work, and that of his colleague [[G. E. Moore]], developed in response to what they perceived as the nonsense dominating British philosophy departments at the turn of the 20th century, which was a kind of [[Idealism|British Idealism]] most of which was derived (albeit very distantly) from the work of [[Hegel]].  In response Moore developed an approach ("Common Sense Philosophy"&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Moore, ''[http://www.ditext.com/moore/common-sense.html A Defence of Common Sense]'' (1925)&lt;/ref&gt;) which sought to examine philosophical difficulties by a close analysis of the language used in order to determine its meaning. In this way Moore sought to expunge philosophical absurdities such as "time is unreal".  Moore's work would have significant, if oblique, influence (largely mediated by [[Wittgenstein]]) on [[Ordinary language philosophy]].

====Other truth theories====
The Vienna Circle, a famous group of [[logical positivists]] from the early 20th century (closely allied with Russell and Frege), adopted the [[The verifiability theory of meaning|verificationist theory of meaning]]. The verificationist theory of meaning (in at least one of its forms) states that to say that an expression is meaningful is to say that there are some conditions of experience that could exist to show that the expression is true. As noted, Frege and Russell were two proponents of this way of thinking.

A [[semantic theory of truth]] was produced by [[Alfred Tarski]] for [[Formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]]. According to Tarski's account, meaning consists of a recursive set of rules that end up yielding an infinite set of sentences, "'p' is true if and only if p", covering the whole language. His innovation produced the notion of [[propositional function]]s discussed on the section on [[universal (metaphysics)|universals]] (which he called "sentential functions"), and a [[model-theoretic]] approach to semantics (as opposed to a [[proof-theoretic]] one). Finally, some links were forged to the [[correspondence theory of truth]] (Tarski, 1944).

Perhaps the most influential current approach in the contemporary theory of meaning is that sketched by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] in his introduction to the collection of essays ''Truth and Meaning'' in 1967.  There he argued for the following two theses:
* Any learnable language must be statable in a finite form, even if it is capable of a theoretically infinite number of expressions—as we may assume that natural human languages are, at least in principle. If it could not be stated in a finite way then it could not be learned through a finite, empirical method such as the way humans learn their languages. It follows that it must be possible to give a theoretical semantics for any natural language which could give the meanings of an infinite number of sentences on the basis of a finite system of axioms.
* Giving the meaning of a sentence, he further argued, was equivalent to stating its ''truth conditions''.  He proposed that it must be possible to account for language as a set of distinct grammatical features together with a lexicon, and for each of them explain its workings in such a way as to generate trivial (obviously correct) statements of the truth conditions of all the (infinitely many) sentences built up from these.

The result is a theory of meaning that rather resembles, by no accident, Tarski's account.

Davidson's account, though brief, constitutes the first systematic presentation of [[truth-conditional semantics]]. He proposed simply translating natural languages into [[first-order predicate calculus]] in order to reduce meaning to a function of truth.

====Saul Kripke====
[[Saul Kripke]] examined the relation between sense and reference in dealing with possible and actual situations. He showed that one consequence of his interpretation of certain systems of [[modal logic]] was that the reference of a proper name is ''necessarily'' linked to its [[referent]], but that the sense is not. So for instance "Hesperus" necessarily refers to Hesperus, even in those imaginary cases and worlds in which perhaps Hesperus is not the  evening star. That is, Hesperus is necessarily Hesperus, but only contingently the morning star.

This results in the curious situation that part of the meaning of a name&amp;nbsp;— that it refers to some particular thing&amp;nbsp;— is a necessary fact about that name, but another part&amp;nbsp;— that it is used in some particular way or situation&amp;nbsp;— is not.

Kripke also drew the distinction between speaker's meaning and semantic meaning, elaborating on the work of ordinary language philosophers [[Paul Grice]] and [[Keith Donnellan]]. The speaker's meaning is what the speaker intends to refer to by saying something; the semantic meaning is what the words uttered by the speaker mean according to the language.

In some cases, people do not say what they mean; in other cases, they say something that is in error. In both these cases, the speaker's meaning and the semantic meaning seem to be different. Sometimes words do not actually express what the speaker wants them to express; so words will mean one thing, and what people intend to convey by them might mean another. The meaning of the expression, in such cases, is ambiguous.

====Critiques of truth-theories of meaning====
[[W.V. Quine]] attacked both verificationism and the very notion of meaning in his famous essay, "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]". In it, he suggested that meaning was nothing more than a vague and dispensable notion. Instead, he asserted, what was more interesting to study was the synonymy between signs. He also pointed out that verificationism was tied to the distinction between [[analytic proposition|analytic]] and [[synthetic proposition|synthetic]] statements, and asserted that such a divide was defended ambiguously. He also suggested that the unit of analysis for any potential investigation into the world (and, perhaps, meaning) would be the entire body of statements taken as a collective, not just individual statements on their own.

Other criticisms can be raised on the basis of the limitations that truth-conditional theorists themselves admit to. Tarski, for instance, recognized that truth-conditional theories of meaning only make sense of statements, but fail to explain the meanings of the lexical parts that make up statements. Rather, the meaning of the parts of statements is presupposed by an understanding of the truth-conditions of a whole statement, and explained in terms of what he called "satisfaction conditions".

Still another objection (noted by Frege and others) was that some kinds of statements don't seem to have any truth-conditions at all. For instance, "Hello!" has no truth-conditions, because it doesn't even attempt to tell the listener anything about the [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] in the world. In other words, different propositions have different [[grammatical moods]].

[[Deflationary theory of truth|Deflationist]] accounts of truth, sometimes called 'irrealist' accounts, are the staunchest source of criticism of truth-conditional theories of meaning. According to them, "truth" is a word with no serious meaning or function in discourse. For instance, for the deflationist, the sentences "It's true that Tiny Tim is trouble" and "Tiny Tim is trouble" are equivalent. In consequence, for the deflationist, any appeal to truth as an account of meaning has little explanatory power.

The sort of truth-theories presented here can also be attacked for their [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalism]] both in practice and principle. The principle of formalism is challenged by the [[informalism|informalists]], who suggest that language is largely a construction of the speaker, and so, not compatible with formalization. The practice of formalism is challenged by those who observe that formal languages (such as present-day quantificational logic) fail to capture the expressive power of natural languages (as is arguably demonstrated in the awkward character of the quantificational explanation of definite description statements, as laid out by Bertrand Russell).

Finally, over the past century, forms of logic have been developed that are not dependent exclusively on the notions of truth and falsity. Some of these types of logic have been called [[modal logic]]s. They explain how certain logical connectives such as "if-then" work in terms of necessity and [[Logical possibility|possibility]]. Indeed, modal logic was the basis of one of the most popular and rigorous formulations in modern semantics called the [[Montague grammar]]. The successes of such systems naturally give rise to the argument that these systems have captured the natural meaning of connectives like if-then far better than an ordinary, truth-functional logic ever could.

==Usage and meaning==

Throughout the 20th century, English philosophy focused closely on analysis of language. This style of [[analytic philosophy]] became very influential and led to the development of a wide range of philosophical tools.

===Ludwig Wittgenstein===

The philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] was originally an artificial language philosopher, following the influence of Russell and Frege. In his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' he had supported the idea of an ideal language built up from atomic statements using logical connectives. However, as he matured, he came to appreciate more and more the phenomenon of natural language. ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'', published after his death, signalled a sharp departure from his earlier work with its focus upon ordinary language use. His approach is often summarised by the aphorism "the meaning of a word is its use in a language". However, following in Frege's footsteps, in the ''Tractatus'', Wittgenstein declares: "... Only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wittgenstein |first=Ludwig |title=Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus |page=39 |year=1999 |publisher=Dover Publications Inc. |isbn=0-486-40445-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work would come to inspire future generations and spur forward a whole new discipline, which explained meaning in a new way. Meaning in a natural language was seen as primarily a question of how the speaker uses words within the language to express intention.

This close examination of [[natural language]] proved to be a powerful philosophical technique. Practitioners who were influenced by Wittgenstein's approach have included an entire tradition of thinkers, featuring [[P. F. Strawson]], [[Paul Grice]], [[R. M. Hare]], [[R. S. Peters]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]].

===J. L. Austin===

At around the same time [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] was re-thinking his approach to language, reflections on the complexity of language led to a more expansive approach to meaning. Following the lead of [[George Edward Moore]], [[J. L. Austin]] examined the use of words in great detail. He argued against fixating on the meaning of words. He showed that dictionary definitions are of limited philosophical use, since there is no simple "appendage" to a word that can be called its meaning. Instead, he showed how to focus on the way in which words are used in order to do things. He analysed the structure of utterances into three distinct parts: [[Figure of speech|locutions]], [[illocutionary act|illocutions]] and [[perlocutionary act|perlocutions]]. His pupil [[John Searle]] developed the idea under the label "[[speech act]]s". Their work greatly influenced [[pragmatics]].

===Peter Strawson===

Past philosophers had understood reference to be tied to words themselves. However, Sir [[Peter Strawson]] disagreed in his seminal essay, "On Referring", where he argued that there is nothing true about statements on their own; rather, only the uses of statements could be considered to be true or false.

Indeed, one of the hallmarks of the ordinary use perspective is its insistence upon the distinctions between meaning and use. ''"Meanings"'', for ordinary language philosophers, are the ''instructions'' for usage of words&amp;nbsp;— the common and conventional definitions of words. ''Usage'', on the other hand, is the actual meanings that individual speakers have&amp;nbsp;— the things that an individual speaker in a particular context wants to refer to. The word "dog" is an example of a meaning, but pointing at a nearby dog and shouting "This dog smells foul!" is an example of usage. From this distinction between usage and meaning arose the divide between the fields of [[Pragmatics]] and [[Semantics]].

Yet another distinction is of some utility in discussing language: "mentioning". ''Mention'' is when an expression refers to itself as a linguistic item, usually surrounded by quotation marks. For instance, in the expression "'Opopanax' is hard to spell", what is referred to is the word itself ("opopanax") and not what it means (an obscure gum resin). Frege had referred to instances of mentioning as "opaque contexts".

In his essay, "Reference and Definite Descriptions", [[Keith Donnellan]] sought to improve upon Strawson's distinction. He pointed out that there are two uses of definite descriptions: ''[[attributive use|attributive]]'' and ''[[referential use|referential]]''. Attributive uses provide a description of whoever is being referred to, while referential uses point out the actual referent. Attributive uses are like mediated references, while referential uses are more directly referential.

===Paul Grice===

The philosopher [[Paul Grice]], working within the ordinary language tradition, understood "meaning"&amp;nbsp;— in his 1957 article&amp;nbsp;— to have two kinds: ''natural'' and ''non-natural''. ''Natural meaning'' had to do with cause and effect, for example with the expression "these spots mean measles". ''Non-natural'' meaning, on the other hand, had to do with the intentions of the speaker in communicating something to the listener.

In his essay, ''Logic and Conversation'', Grice went on to explain and defend an explanation of how conversations work. His guiding maxim was called the ''cooperative principle'', which claimed that the speaker and the listener will have mutual expectations of the kind of information that will be shared. The principle is broken down into four maxims: ''Quality'' (which demands truthfulness and honesty), ''Quantity'' (demand for just enough information as is required), ''Relation'' (relevance of things brought up), and ''Manner'' (lucidity).  This principle, if and when followed, lets the speaker and listener figure out the meaning of certain implications by way of inference.

The works of Grice led to an avalanche of research and interest in the field, both supportive and critical. One spinoff was called [[Relevance theory]], developed by [[Dan Sperber]] and [[Deirdre Wilson]] during the mid-1980s, whose goal was to make the notion of ''relevance'' more clear. Similarly, in his work, "[[Universal pragmatics]]", Jürgen Habermas began a program that sought to improve upon the work of the ordinary language tradition. In it, he laid out the goal of a valid conversation as a pursuit of mutual understanding.

===Inferential role semantics===

{{main|Inferential role semantics}}

[[Michael Dummett]] argued against the kind of [[truth-conditional semantics]] presented by Davidson. Instead, he argued that basing semantics on ''assertion conditions'' avoids a number of difficulties with truth-conditional semantics, such as the transcendental nature of certain kinds of truth condition.  He leverages work done in [[proof-theoretic semantics]] to provide a kind of inferential role semantics, where:
* The meaning of sentences and grammatical constructs is given by their assertion conditions; and
* Such a semantics is only guaranteed to be coherent if the inferences associated with the parts of language are in [[logical harmony]].
A semantics based upon assertion conditions is called a [[The verifiability theory of meaning|verificationist]] semantics: cf. the verificationism of the Vienna Circle.

This work is closely related, though not identical, to one-factor theories of [[conceptual role semantics]].

===Critiques of use theories of meaning===

Sometimes between the 1950-1990s, cognitive scientist [[Jerry Fodor]] said that use theories (of the Wittgensteinian kind) seem to assume that language is solely a public phenomenon, that there is no such thing as a "private language". Fodor thinks it is necessary to create or describe the ''[[language of thought]]'', which would seemingly require the existence of a "private language".

In the 1960s, [[David Kellogg Lewis]] described meaning as use, a feature of a social [[Convention (norm)|convention]]&lt;!-- (see also [[convention (philosophy)]])--&gt; and conventions as regularities of a specific sort. Lewis' work was an application of [[game theory]] in philosophical topics.&lt;ref&gt;Rescorla, Michael, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/convention/#Lew "Convention"], ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Spring 2011 Edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Conventions, he argued, are a species of [[Coordination game|coordination]] [[Nash equilibrium|equilibria]].

==Idea theory of meaning&lt;!--'Idea theory of meaning' and 'Ideational theory of meaning' redirect here--&gt;==

The '''idea theory of meaning'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (also '''ideational theory of meaning'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;), most commonly associated with the British [[empiricism|empiricist]] [[John Locke]], claims that meanings are [[mental representation]]s provoked by signs.&lt;ref&gt; Grigoris Antoniou, John Slaney (eds.), ''Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence'', Springer, 1998, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "ideas" is used to refer to either mental representations, or to mental activity in general. Those who seek an explanation for meaning in the former sort of account endorse a stronger sort of idea theory of mind than the latter. Those who seek an explanation for meaning in the former sort of account endorse a stronger sort of idea theory of meaning than the latter.

Each idea is understood to be necessarily ''about'' something external and/or internal, real or imaginary. For example, in contrast to the abstract meaning of the [[universal (metaphysics)|universal]] "dog", the [[referent]] "this dog" may mean a particular real life chihuahua. In both cases, the word is about something, but in the former it is about the class of dogs as generally understood, while in the latter it is about a very real and particular dog in the real world.

===Stronger idea theories===
[[John Locke]], considered all ideas to be both imaginable objects of sensation and the very ''un''imaginable objects of reflection. Locke said in his ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', that words are used both as signs for ideas—but also to signify the lack of certain ideas. [[David Hume]] held that thoughts were kinds of imaginable entities. (See Hume's ''[[Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'', section 2). Hume argued that any words that could not call upon any past experience were without meaning.

Nonetheless, [[George Berkeley]] and  [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] held, in contrast to Locke and Hume, that ideas alone are unable to account for the different variations within a general meaning. For example, any hypothetical image of the meaning of "dog" has to include such varied images as a chihuahua, a pug, and a Black Lab; and this seems impossible to imagine, all of those particular breeds looking very different from one another. Another way to see this point is to question why it is that, if we have an image of a specific type of dog (say of a chihuahua), it should be entitled to represent the entire concept.

Another criticism is that some meaningful words, known as non-lexical items, don't have any meaningfully associated image. For example, the word "the" has a meaning, but one would be hard-pressed to find a mental representation that fits it. Still another objection lies in the observation that certain linguistic items name something in the real world, and are meaningful, yet which we have no mental representations to deal with. For instance, it is not known what Newton's father looked like, yet the phrase ''"Newton's father"'' still has meaning.

Another problem is that of composition&amp;nbsp;— that it is difficult to explain how words and phrases combine into sentences if only ideas were involved in meaning.

===Weaker idea theories===
[[File:Prototype membership.gif|thumb|Memberships of a graded class]]

[[Eleanor Rosch]] and [[George Lakoff]] advanced the theory of [[prototype (linguistics)|prototypes]], which suggests that many lexical categories, at least on the face of things, have "radial structures". That is to say, there are some ideal member(s) in the category that seem to represent the category better than other members. For example, the category of "birds" may feature the ''robin'' as the prototype, or the ideal kind of bird. With experience, subjects might come to evaluate membership in the category of "bird" by comparing candidate members to the prototype and evaluating for similarities. So, for example, a penguin or an ostrich would sit at the fringe of the meaning of "bird", because a penguin is unlike a robin.

Intimately related to these researches is the notion of a ''psychologically basic level'', which is both the first level named and understood by children, and "the highest level at which a single mental image can reflect the entire category". (Lakoff 1987:46) The "basic level" of cognition is understood by Lakoff as crucially drawing upon "image-schemas" along with various other cognitive processes.

The philosophers ([[Ned Block]], [[Gilbert Harman]], H. Field) and the cognitive scientists (G. Miller and P. Johnson-Laird) say  that the meaning of a term can be found by investigating its role in relation to other concepts and mental states. They endorse a view called "[[conceptual role semantics]]". Those proponents of this view who understand meanings to be exhausted by the content of mental states can be said to endorse "one-factor" accounts of conceptual role semantics. and thus  fit within the tradition of idea theories.

'''''Nemo iudex in causa sua''''' (or ''nemo iudex in sua causa'') is a [[Latin]] phrase that means, literally, "no-one should be a judge in his own case." It is a principle of [[natural justice]] that no person can judge a case in which they have an interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legal-glossary.org/nemo-judex-in-sua-causa/ |title=Legal definition of Nemo iudex in causa sua |publisher=legal-glossary.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule is very strictly applied to any appearance of a possible bias, even if there is actually none: "Justice must not only be done, but must be seen to be done".&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy]]'', [1924] 1 KB 256, [1923] All ER 233&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle may also be called:
* ''nemo judex idoneus in propria causa est''
* ''nemo judex in parte sua''
* ''nemo judex in re sua''
* ''nemo debet esse judex in propria causa''
* ''in propria causa nemo judex''

The legal effect of a breach of natural justice is normally to stop the proceedings and render any judgment invalid; it should be quashed or appealed, but may be remitted for a valid re-hearing.

The phrase is credited to Sir [[Edward Coke]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/show_me_the_money_states_aba_try_to_figure_out_when_campaign_cash_adds_up ABA Journal,] "Show Me the Money: States, ABA Try to Figure Out When Campaign Cash Leads to a Judge’s Recusal", 1 March 2012 (retrieved 28 June 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Чтобы больше иметь — надо больше производить. Чтобы больше производить — надо больше знать.jpg|thumb|1920 propaganda poster: "In order to have more, it is necessary to produce more. In order to produce more, it is necessary to know more."]]
The '''New Soviet man''' or '''New Soviet person''' ({{lang-ru|новый советский человек}} ''novy sovetsky chelovek''), as postulated by the [[State ideology of the Soviet Union|ideologists]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], was an [[archetype]] of a person with specific qualities that were said to be emerging as dominant among all citizens of the [[Soviet Union]], irrespective of the country's cultural, ethnic, and linguistic diversity, creating a single [[Soviet people]], Soviet nation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolay Vasilyevich Ustryalov|Nikolay Ustryalov]], ''From [[New Economic Policy|NEP]] to Soviet Socialism'' (1934) ([http://www.magister.msk.ru/library/philos/ustryalov/ustry035.htm text online]) {{ru icon}} {{Page needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intent==

From the ideology's roots in the mid 19th and early 20th century, ideologists of [[Communism]] have postulated that within the new society of [[Stateless communism|pure communism]] and the social conditions therein, a New Man and New Woman would develop with qualities reflecting surrounding circumstances of post-scarcity and unprecedented scientific development.&lt;ref&gt;

For example, [[Leon Trotsky]] wrote in 1924 in ''[[Literature and Revolution]]'' about the "Communist man", "man of the future":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1924/lit_revo/ch08.htm |title=Ch. 8 '&amp;#39;Revolutionary and Socialist Art |publisher=Marxists.org |date=2007-01-06 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Man will make it his purpose to master his own feelings, to raise his instincts to the heights of consciousness, to make them transparent, to extend the wires of his will into hidden recesses, and thereby to raise himself to a new plane, to create a higher social biologic type, or, if you please, a superman.}}

[[Wilhelm Reich]] asked in 1933: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Will the new socio-economic system reproduce itself in the structure of the people's character? If so, how? Will his traits be inherited by his children? Will he be a free, self-regulating personality? Will the elements of freedom incorporated into the structure of the personality make any authoritarian forms of government unnecessary?&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Reich]], ''The Mass Psychology of Fascism'', Chapter 8, ''Masses and the State'' {{Page needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Author and philosopher [[Bernard Byhovsky]], Ph.D. writes: "The new man is endowed, first of all, with a new ethical outlook." &lt;ref&gt;Bernard Bykhovsky, ''The New Man in the Making'' (Moscow: Novosti Press Agency Publishing House) {{Page needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The New Man==
[[File:1988 CPA 6017.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman]]'' commemorated in a Soviet stamp in [[Socialist realism|Socialist realist]] style.]]
The Soviet man was to be selfless, learned, healthy, muscular, and enthusiastic in spreading the [[Socialism|socialist]] [[Proletarian revolution|Revolution]]. Adherence to [[Marxism-Leninism]], and individual behavior consistent with that philosophy's prescriptions, were among the crucial traits expected of the New Soviet man, which required intellectualism and hard discipline.&lt;ref&gt;[[B. R. Myers]], ''The Cleanest Race'', p 81 {{ISBN|9781933633916}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not driven by crude impulses of nature but by conscious self-mastery, a belief that required the rejection of both innate personality and the unconscious, which Soviet psychologists therefore rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p258 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He treated public property with respect, as if it were his own.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.roca.org/OA/76-77/76f.htm 1917-1987: Unsuccessful and Tragic Attempt to Create a “New Man”]"&lt;/ref&gt;  He also has lost any nationalist sentiments, being Soviet rather than Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, or any of the many other nationalities found in the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/soviet_union/su_glos.html Glossary -- Soviet Union]"&lt;/ref&gt;

His work required exertion and austerity, to show the new man triumphing over his base instincts.&lt;ref&gt;B. R. Myers, ''The Cleanest Race'', p 86 {{ISBN|9781933633916}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexey Stakhanov]]'s spurious&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/31/world/in-soviet-eager-beaver-s-legend-works-overtime.html |first=Serge |last=Schmemann |title=In Soviet, Eager Beaver's Legend Works Overtime |work=The New York Times |date=31 August 1985 |page=2 &lt;!-- section 1, column 3 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]], October 15, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; record-breaking day in mining coal caused him to be set forth as the exemplar of the "new man" and the members of [[Stakhanovite movement]]s tried to become Stakhanovites.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Overy]], ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p258-9 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This could also be a new woman; ''[[Pravda]]'' described the Soviet woman as someone who had and could never have existed before.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p259 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Female Stakhanovites were rarer than male, but a quarter of all trade-union women were designated as "norm-breaking."&lt;ref name="overy260"&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p260 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the Paris World Fair, [[Vera Mukhina]] depicted a momentual sculpture, ''[[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman]]'', dressed in work clothing, pressing forward with his hammer and her sickle crossed.&lt;ref name="overy260"/&gt;

[[Aleksandr Zinovyev]] put forth the satirical argument that a new kind of person was indeed created by the Soviet system, but held that this new man - which they call ''[[Homo Sovieticus]]'' - was in many ways the opposite of the ideal of the New Soviet man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4760109.stm |title=Soviet-era satirist Zinovyev dies |publisher= BBC News|date= 2006-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selflessness===
Among the major traits of a new Soviet man was [[Altruism|selfless]] [[collectivism]].  The selfless new man was willing to sacrifice his life for good causes.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p301 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This trait was glorified from the first Soviet days, as exemplified by lines from the poem ''Vladimir Ilyich Lenin'' by the Soviet poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Who needs a "1"?
The voice of a "1"
:is thinner than a squeak.
Who will hear it?
:Only the wife...
A "1" is nonsense.
:A "1" is zero.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fictional characters and presentations of contemporary celebrities embodying this model were prominent features of Soviet [[culture|cultural]] life, especially at times when fostering the concept of the New Soviet man was given special priority by the government.

[[Pro-natalist]] policies encouraging women to have many children were justified by the selfishness inherent in limiting the next generation of "new men."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p257 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Soviet Woman==
[[File:SovietWoman1920.jpg|thumb|250px|"What the [[October Revolution]] gave to the female worker and peasant". 1920 Soviet propaganda poster. The inscriptions on the buildings read "library", "kindergarten", "school for grown-ups", etc.]]
In the 1920s and into the Stalinist era the concept of the "New Soviet Woman" served alongside that of the "New Soviet Man." Her roles were vastly different than that of her male counterpart; she was burdened with a complex identity that changed with ideology shifts in the party doctrine toward more [[conservative]] notions of the role of the family and the mother in the Soviet system. The New Soviet Woman was a Superwoman who balanced competing responsibilities and took on the burden of multiple roles: Communist citizen, full-time worker, wife and mother.&lt;ref name="BarbaraEvansC"&gt;Barbara Evans Clements, Daughters of the Revolution: A History of Women in the U.S.S.R. (Illinois: Harlan Davidson, Inc., 1994), 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Soviet Person was generally characterized as male. In [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|Soviet propaganda]] centered on the New Soviet Person, it was standard for men to be depicted as the primary actors, either battling opponents of the Marxist revolution or rebuilding the world. Women, on the other hand, were often portrayed as "backward," passive beneficiaries of the revolution rather than its securers. This was so not least because the proletarian movement was organized and fought by the working class, which by and large consisted of men.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Thus, propaganda often equated male domination with proletariat domination. Although the party leadership claimed the sexes enjoyed equal status under the law, a significant accomplishment in itself, men remained the measure of worth.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Alpern Engel, Women in Russia: 1700-2000 (Cambridge University Press, 2004), 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

This marginalization of women in the newly developing civil order made it difficult for women to find a place among the proletarian class for which the revolution was fought. Regulations during the [[New Economic Policy]] period on the extent to which women could work in dangerous conditions, how many hours they could work in a shift and the kinds of special care they received during maternity made many factory owners reluctant to hire women, despite the Commissariat of Labor's requirements that women to be given equal access to employment.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Alpern Engel, Women in Russia: 1700-2000 (Cambridge University Press, 2004), 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were gains made in combating illiteracy and promoting education for women during the 1920s. Soviet policy encouraged working-class women to attend school and develop vocational skills. There existed opportunities for women to participate in politics, become party members and vie for elected and administrative positions. Access to the political sphere, however, was extremely limited.&lt;ref name="Gail Warshofsky Lapidus 1978"&gt;Gail Warshofsky Lapidus, Women in Soviet Society: Equality, Development, and Social Change (University of California Press, 1978), 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Stalin's policies on women were more conservative than that of his predecessor Lenin. Because he was concerned with a declining population rate, Stalin de-emphasized the Marxist feminist view of women in society, which, in his view, freed women from patriarchy and capitalism. In keeping with the party line, Stalin reasserted the importance of women in the workforce and female education, primarily literacy, although he began to emphasize the role of mother in a way that differed from more radical notions of the early 1920s.&lt;ref name="Gail Warshofsky Lapidus 1978"/&gt;

The "withering away" of the family was no longer a goal of economic and political progress. The new party line was that the family, like the state, was to grow stronger with the full realization of socialism. Massive propaganda campaigns linked the joys of motherhood with the benefits of Soviet power.&lt;ref name="Gail Warshofsky Lapidus 1978"/&gt; Soviet ideology began to argue that women's public roles were compatible with her roles as wife and mother. In fact, that the two reinforced one another and were both necessary for real womanhood.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Warshofsky Lapidus, Women in Soviet Society: Equality, Development, and Social Change (University of California Press, 1978), 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Soviet Woman differed greatly from the conceptions of revolutionaries preceding the 1930s. Instead of being freed from domestic concerns, she was bound to them. Though she now filled the role of man's peer in the workplace, she was also obligated to devote herself to being his helpmate in the home.&lt;ref name="BarbaraEvansC"/&gt; One of the primary roles of the New Soviet Woman was that of mother. This role became of great importance in the wake of population decline beginning in the 1920s. War and revolution had decimated the population. Legislation legalizing abortions and the increasing use of contraception—though still not that widespread—in the 1920s also contributed to the lower population numbers as women began to work more and give birth less.&lt;ref name="Barbara Alpern Engel 2004"&gt;Barbara Alpern Engel, Women in Russia: 1700-2000 (Cambridge University Press, 2004), 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a means to combat that trend, propaganda placed a new emphasis on the female's role as the perpetuator of the Communist regime in their ability to produce the next class of healthy workers, a policy called [[pronatalism]]. Propaganda presented pronatalism, a means to encourage women to bear children, in different ways to urban working-class women and to rural peasant women. Propaganda designed for an urban audience linked healthy female sexuality with reproduction while medical information to peasant women positioned conception as the purpose of sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Barbara Alpern Engel 2004"/&gt;

The new ideal Soviet woman appealed to many Soviet women. Many had found Marxist feminism difficult to swallow and preferred their traditional female roles.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Evans Clements, Daughters of the Revolution: A History of Women in the U.S.S.R. (Illinois: Harlan Davidson, Inc., 1994), 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Although these women drew satisfaction from their role as mothers, they appreciated the opportunity afforded them by the Communist ideology to dismantle the oppression that often went hand-in-hand with domestic life.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} With husbands that often beat, abused, and abandoned them{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} and a society and government that looked down on them as intellectually and ideologically inferior prior to the Stalinist era{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}, many women welcomed the ability to cast aside the stigma that came with their role as mother while retaining the status as an equal participant in society.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

During the 1920s and into the Stalinist era, Soviet policy forced women to curtail their professional aspirations in order to fulfill their dual role as worker and housewife. Competing requirements of family life limited female occupational mobility. Women managed the role strain experienced during the Stalinist era either by either a restriction of professional aspirations or by limiting family size. Despite pitfalls, unprecedented opportunities were available to lower-class women during this time. Women now had a voice in debates and the Zhenotdel, the women's section of the Central Committee from 1919–1930, made strides during its operation to increase political, social and economic agency of Soviet women.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Alpern Engel, Women in Russia: 1700-2000 (Cambridge University Press, 2004), 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary perspective==
An [[evolution]]ary perspective, based primarily on the evolutionary process of [[natural selection]], has been proposed to explain variations in human personality and individuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rv_tCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=natural+selection+developed+individuality+personality&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-5kYpIG2yU&amp;sig=v2q4lDsPpxgr4P9UWjIpnyTDPAs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwis4vCtoY3UAhWKrY8KHbagA_QQ6AEISDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=natural%20selection%20developed%20individuality%20personality&amp;f=false|title=Foundations of Personality|first1=P.J.|last1=Hettema|first2=Ian J.|last2=Deary|date=11 November 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|page=7|isbn=978-94-011-1660-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, evolution introduced variations of the human mind and natural selection acted on these by choosing which were the most beneficial and which led to a greater fitness. Due to human complexity, many opposing personality traits proved to be beneficial in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/daniel.nettle/american%20psychologist.pdf|title=The Evolution of Personality Variation in Humans and Other Animals|journal=European Journal of Personality|date=August 2007|first1=Lars|last1=Penke|first2=Jaap J. A.|last2=Denissen|first3=Geoffrey F.|last3=Miller|volume=21|issue=5|pages=549–587|issn=0890-2070|doi=10.1002/per.629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary perspective traces personality and individuality back to when the early humans were learning how to function in complex social groups. Many specialists from different fields have a general agreement that early humans saw themselves as a part of the group to which they belonged, rather than seeing themselves as individuals with independent personalities. In terms of personality at this time, the whole group was identical.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;Bell, M. G. (2010, January 1). Consciousness: The Evolution Of The Self And Personal Individuality. Retrieved November 1, 2014, from
www.agenthuman.com/product/evolution_self_personal_individuality.html#selfevol&lt;/ref&gt; A member of the group associated themselves as one with the tribe and therefore the responsibility rested in the group and not the individual. Kropotkin explained the importance of this by stating that because the primitive man identified his existence with the existence of his tribe it has allowed for mankind to reach the remarkable level present today. A small step of differentiation that later led to personality and individuality was the division of labor. This differentiation was necessary in order for the group to function in a much more efficient way. This differentiation became adaptive since it increased the groups functionality. These early humans then continued to develop personality and individuality, which stemmed from their group and the social interactions they encountered. Individual life, and thus individuality and personality essentially arose from collective life.&lt;ref name=Bell /&gt;

==Lifespan perspectives==

Classic theories of personality, such as [[Freud’s tripartite theory]], and post-Freudian theory, including [[developmental stage theories]] and [[personality type|type theories]], have often held the perspective that most personality development occurs in childhood, and that personality is stable by the end of adolescence. As recently as the 1990s, modern personality theorists concurred with [[William James]]’ 1890 assertion that, by age 30, personality is “set like plaster”.&lt;ref&gt;Costa, P. T. Jr. &amp; McCrae, R. R. (1994). Set like plaster? Evidence for the stability of adult personality. In T. F. Heatherton &amp; J. L. Weinberger (Eds.), Can personality change? (pp.&amp;nbsp;21–40). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently, lifespan perspectives that integrate theory and empirical findings dominate the research literature. The lifespan perspective                         of personality is based on the ''plasticity principle'', that personality traits are open systems that can be influenced by the environment at any age.&lt;ref name="Roberts, B. W. 2010 pp. 375-398"/&gt; This interactional model of development emphasizes the relationships between an individual and her environment, and suggests that there is a dialectic between continuity and change throughout the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baltes | first1 = P. B. | year = 1997 | title = On the incomplete architecture of human ontogeny: Selection, optimization, and compensation as foundation of developmental theory | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 52 | issue = 4| pages = 366–380 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.52.4.366}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, B.

Staudinger &amp; U. Lindenberger (Eds.), Understanding human development: Life span psychology in exchange with other disciplines (pp.183-214). Dodrecht: Kluwer.&lt;/ref&gt;
Large-scale longitudinal studies have demonstrated that the most active period of personality development appears to be between the ages of 20-40.&lt;ref name="Roberts, B. W. 2010 pp. 375-398"/&gt; Personality grows increasingly consistent with age and plateaus sometime around age 50, but never reaches a period of total stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = B.W. | last2 = Mroczek | first2 = D. | year = 2008 | title = Personality trait change in adulthood | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 31–35 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00543.x | pmid=19756219 | pmc=2743415}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although change is less likely later in life, individuals retain the potential for change from infancy to old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = B.

==Influencing factors==
Personality traits demonstrate moderate levels of continuity, smaller but still significant normative or mean-level changes, and individual differences in change, often late into the life course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = B. W. | last2 = Caspi | first2 = A. | last3 = Moffitt | first3 = T. | year = 2001 | title = The kids are alright: Growth and stability in personality development from adolescence to adulthood | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 81 | issue = | pages = 670–683 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.4.670}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern is influenced by genetic, environmental, transactional, and [[stochastic]] factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fraley | first1 = R.

W. | year = 2005 | title = Patterns of continuity: A dynamic model of conceptualizing the stability of individual differences in psychological constructs across the life course | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 112 | issue = 1| pages = 60–74 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.112.1.60 | pmid=15631588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===
Twin and adoption studies have demonstrated that the [[heritability]] of personality traits ranges from .3-.6, with a mean of .5.&lt;ref name="Harkness, A. R. 1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harkness | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Lilienfeld | first2 = S. O. | year = 1997 | title = Individual differences science for treatment planning: Personality traits | url = | journal = Psychological Assessment | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 349–360 | doi=10.1037/1040-3590.9.4.349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heritability of .5 means that 50% of variation in observable personality traits is attributable to genetic influences. But a given genotype will lead to a certain phenotype only under the right environmental circumstances.&lt;ref name="South, S. C. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = South | first1 = S. C. | last2 = Krueger | first2 = R. F. | year = 2008 | title = An interactionist perspective on genetic and environmental contributions to personality | url = | journal = Social and Personality Psychology Compass | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 929–948 | doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2007.00062.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the heritability of a trait may change depending on an individual’s environment and/or life events. An example of the way environment can moderate the expression of a gene is the finding by Heath, Eaves, and Martin (1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heath | first1 = A. C. | last2 = Eaves | first2 = L. J. | last3 = Martin | first3 = N. G. | year = 1998 | title = Interaction of marital status and genetic risk for symptoms of depression | url = | journal = Twin Research | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 119–122 | doi=10.1375/136905298320566249}}&lt;/ref&gt; that marriage was a protective factor against depression in genetically identical twins, such that the heritability of depression was as low as 29% in a married twin and as high as 51% in an unmarried twin. Ultimately, emerging evidence suggests that genetic and environmental influences on personality differ depending on other circumstances in a person’s life.&lt;ref name="South, S. C. 2008"/&gt;

===Environmental===
With the effects of genetic similarity removed, children from the same family often appear no more alike than randomly selected strangers;&lt;ref&gt;Turkheimer, E. &amp; Waldron, M. (2000). Non shared environment: A theoretical, methodological, and quantitative review.&lt;/ref&gt; yet identical twins raised apart are nearly as similar in personality as identical twins raised together.&lt;ref name="Harkness, A. R. 1997"/&gt; What these findings suggest is that shared family environment has virtually no effect on personality development, and that similarity between relatives is almost entirely due to shared genetics. Although the shared environment (including features like the personality, parenting styles, and beliefs of parents; socioeconomic status; neighborhood; nutrition; schools attended; number of books in the home; etc.) may have a lasting impact at the extremes of parenting practice, such as outright abuse, most personality researchers have concluded that the majority of “average expectable environments”&lt;ref name="Harkness, A. R. 1997"/&gt; do not have an effect on personality development.

The weakness of shared environmental effects in shaping personality came as a surprise to many psychologists, and spurred research into nonshared environment, or the environmental influences that make siblings different from one another instead of similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Plomin | first1 = R. | last2 = Daniels | first2 = D. | year = 1987 | title = Why are children in the same family so different from one another? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 1–16 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00055941| pmc = 3147063 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non shared environmental effects encompass the variability in behavioral outcomes that is not explained by genetic and family environmental influences. The non shared environment may include differential treatment by parents, individually distinct reactions to the shared family environment, peer influences, and experiences that occur outside the family, as well as test error in measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Plomin | first1 = R. | last2 = Asbury | first2 = K. | last3 = Dip | first3 = P.

Further effects of environment in adulthood are demonstrated by findings that different work, marital, and family experiences are associated with personality change,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = B.

===Gene-environment interactions===
Van Gestel and Van Broeckhoven (2003) write, “Almost by definition, [[complex traits]] originate from interplay between (multiple) genetic factors and environment.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Gestel | first1 = S. | last2 = Van Broeckhoven | first2 = C. | year = 2003 | title = Genetics of personality: are we making progress? | url = | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 840–852 | doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001367 | pmid=14515135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactions between genetic predisposition and the environment are a major factor in personality development. The ''corresponsive principle of personality development'' states that “life experiences may accentuate and reinforce the personality characteristics that were partially responsible for the particular environmental elicitations in the first place”.&lt;ref&gt;Donnellan, M. B. &amp; Robins, R. W. (2009). The development of personality across the lifespan. In P. J. Corr &amp; G. Matthews (Eds.), The Cambridge handbook of personality psychology (pp. 191-204). New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This principle summarizes how gene-environment interactions (also called person-situation transactions) maintain and reinforce the continuity of personality throughout the lifespan. Three main types of gene-environment interactions are '''active''' (the process by which individuals with certain genotypes select and create environments that facilitate the expression of those genotypes), '''passive''' (the process by which genetic parents provide both the genes and the early environmental influences that contribute to the development of a characteristic in their children), and '''reactive''' (the process by which non-family individuals respond to the behavior produced by a genotype in characteristic ways).&lt;ref name="Harkness, A.

In [[projective geometry]], a '''plane at infinity''' is the [[hyperplane at infinity]] of a three dimensional [[projective space]] or to any [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] contained in the hyperplane at infinity of any projective space of higher dimension. This article will be concerned solely with the three-dimensional case.

==Definition==
There are two approaches to defining the ''plane at infinity'' which depend on whether one starts with a projective 3-space or an [[affine space|affine 3-space]].

If a projective 3-space is given, the ''plane at infinity'' is any distinguished [[projective plane]] of the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Samuel|1988|loc=p. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view emphasizes the fact that this plane is not geometrically different than any other plane. On the other hand, given an affine 3-space, the ''plane at infinity'' is a projective plane which is added to the affine 3-space in order to give it closure of [[Incidence (geometry)|incidence]] properties. Meaning that the points of the ''plane at infinity'' are the points where parallel lines of the affine 3-space will meet, and the [[line (geometry)|lines]] are the lines where parallel planes of the affine 3-space will meet. The result of the addition is the projective 3-space, &lt;math&gt;P^3&lt;/math&gt;. This point of view emphasizes the internal structure of the plane at infinity, but does make it look "special" in comparison to the other planes of the space.

If the affine 3-space is real, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, then the addition of a [[real projective plane]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}P^2&lt;/math&gt; at infinity produces the real projective 3-space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}P^3&lt;/math&gt;.

==Analytic representation==
Since any two projective planes in a projective 3-space are equivalent, we can choose a [[homogeneous coordinates|homogeneous coordinate system]] so that any point on the plane at infinity is represented as (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':0).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meserve|1983|loc=p. 150}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Any point in the affine 3-space will then be represented as (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':1). The points on the plane at infinity seem to have three degrees of freedom, but homogeneous coordinates are equivalent [[up to]] any rescaling:

: &lt;math&gt; (X : Y : Z : 0) \equiv (a X : a Y : a Z : 0) &lt;/math&gt;,

so that the coordinates (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':0) can be [[Normalized vector|normalized]], thus reducing the degrees of freedom to two (thus, a surface, namely a projective plane).

''Proposition'': Any line which passes through the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] (0:0:0:1) and through a point (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':1) will intersect the plane at infinity at the point (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':0).

''Proof'': A line which passes through points (0:0:0:1) and (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':1) will consist of points which are [[homogeneous coordinates#Linear Combinations of Points Described with Homogeneous Co-ordinates|linear combinations]] of the two given points:
:&lt;math&gt; a (0:0:0:1) + b (X:Y:Z:1) = (bX :bY: bZ: a + b). &lt;/math&gt;
For such a point to lie on the plane at infinity we must have, &lt;math&gt; a + b = 0&lt;/math&gt;. So, by choosing &lt;math&gt; a = - b&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain the point  
&lt;math&gt;(bX:bY:bZ:0) = (X : Y : Z : 0) &lt;/math&gt;, as required.  [[Q.E.D.]]

Any pair of parallel lines in 3-space will intersect each other at a point on the plane at infinity.  Also, every line in 3-space intersects the plane at infinity at a unique point.  This point is determined by the direction—and only by the direction—of the line.  To determine this point, consider a line parallel to the given line, but passing through the origin, if the line does not already pass through the origin. Then choose any point, other than the origin, on this second line.  If the homogeneous coordinates of this point are (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':1), then the homogeneous coordinates of the point at infinity through which the first and second line both pass is (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':0).

''Example'': Consider a line passing through the points (0:0:1:1) and (3:0:1:1).  A parallel line passes through points (0:0:0:1) and (3:0:0:1).  This second line intersects the plane at infinity at the point (3:0:0:0).  But the first line also passes through this point:
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda (3:0:1:1) + \mu (0:0:1:1) &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = (3 \lambda : 0 : \lambda + \mu : \lambda + \mu)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = ( 3 : 0 : 0 : 0) &lt;/math&gt;
when &lt;math&gt;\lambda + \mu = 0&lt;/math&gt;. ■

Any pair of parallel planes in affine 3-space will intersect each other in a projective line (a [[line at infinity]]) in the plane at infinity.  Also, every plane in the affine 3-space intersects the plane at infinity in a unique line.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woods|1961|loc=p. 187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This line is determined by the direction—and only by the direction—of the plane.

==Properties==
Since the plane at infinity is a projective plane, it is [[homeomorphic]] to the surface of a "sphere modulo antipodes", i.e. a sphere in which [[antipodal point]]s are equivalent: S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/{1,-1} where the quotient is understood as a quotient by a group action (see [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]]).

Police are often a significant source of abuse for sex workers, particularly poor sex workers. Greater exposure to the police often means more experience of police abuse; one study found that sex workers with greater police oversight were more likely to be obliged to provide free sexual services to the police than sex workers with less police oversight.&lt;ref name="levittChicago"/&gt; For some groups of sex workers in some locations in the U.S., police are the primary source of violence.&lt;ref name="torrezChicago"/&gt; Police may be the most abusive towards sex workers who have experienced the most victimization from other sources; a study found that sex workers who had been manipulated, coerced, or forced into sex work were more likely to suffer police abuse than sex workers who chose to enter sex work.&lt;ref name="burnsAlaska"/&gt; 

Police abuse can have long lasting consequences; when police falsely arrest someone for prostitution, the resulting criminal record may make it difficult for that person to find jobs or get housing. Incarceration and court attendance for false charges can disrupt efforts to pursue careers outside of sex work, as when a student misses classes.&lt;ref name="viceNYC"/&gt; Seemingly innocuous actions can affect safety; when officers tell sex workers to "move along", the workers often end up in areas where they feel less safe.&lt;ref name="arringtonDC"/&gt; When police target an HIV+ person for repeated arrests, they may prevent the person from going to scheduled appointments with health care providers, and jail disrupts medication routines.&lt;ref name="hrwNewOrleans"/&gt; And sometimes abuse creates physical harm that is immediate and intentional, as when police officers physically assault a sex worker without evidence of crime and without making an arrest.&lt;ref name="thukral0NYC"/&gt;

This article lists government investigations, research reports, and news articles that describe police abuse of sex workers in the United States, and gives a description of the relevant information from each document.

Excerpt from a sex worker story:

The general trend of the study statistics was that the sex workers who had suffered the worst victimization in the past were the ones most likely to be abused by the police.

The following tables compare the experiences of three groups: all the respondents in the study, the respondents where were manipulated or coerced into sex work, and the respondents who were forced into sex work.

Respondents who were manipulated or coerced into sex work were more likely to attempt to report a crime, but the police were less likely to take their report and more likely to threaten or arrest them.

The DOJ found "indications that the BCPD disregards reports of sexual assault by people involved in the sex trade..." Investigators heard from the community that officers were coercing sexual favors from sex workers. Internal records indicated that this was true and the officers weren't being punished. Prior to the DOJ investigation, an internal investigation by the BCPD found an officer receiving sex from a sex worker in exchange for money and immunity from arrest. The case was closed without any attempt to gather more evidence, interview the police officer, or prosecute the officer. Cases were opened for the same officer a second and third time for the same offense. The witness for the third case died before she could be interviewed, and only then did the BCPD review the officer's phone records and discover that he had sent sexually explicit messages to a number of female sex workers. The officer was allowed to retire. The DOJ found similar cases involving other officers.

The primary form of police abuse was coercive sex, through the threat of arrest. In some cases the officer received the sexual service and arrested the sex worker anyway.

This is a working paper that was never published, as far as I know. However, the PDF file is freely available and some of the results are discussed in Levitt and Dubner's book ''SuperFreakonomics''. 

The study compared two neighborhoods, one where none of the women had pimps, and one where all the women had pimps. The women without pimps were more likely to be arrested and three percent of all sexual services were provided to police officers free of charge. The women with pimps were less likely to be arrested and didn't provide free sexual services. Sex workers were more likely to have sex with a police officer than be arrested by one.

Twenty four percent of street-based sex workers had been raped by a police officer. Twenty percent had experienced other sexual assault from police officers. Women doing survival sex and women in drug houses experienced a lot of violence from police. Thirty percent of exotic dancers who had been raped were raped by police, and twenty percent of the sexual violence they experienced was committed by police. Twenty five percent of escorts had been robbed by a police officer. Eighteen percent of escorts had been forced to masturbate a police officer.

2012

This is a survey of bad encounters experienced by young people in the sex trade and street economy. Bad encounters were divided into three categories: violence, harassment, and refusal to help. The largest source of both harassment and violence was the category of police, which included the Chicago Police Department, the FBI, and security guards in schools. Sexual violence by police made up 11% of all bad encounters.

One of the main findings was that institutional violence made individual violence worse. When girls suffered harm and sought help, the system they were seeking help from often did more harm. An example was a girl being arrested when she tried to file a report for rape. Or this:

{{ quote
| text= I went to the hospital for a rape kit and when I got there the police officer accused me and my advocate of not cooperating. The officer started yelling at us both and said I was going to jail for lying. The officer never filed a report but called Child Services and I got sent to a group home but nothing ever happened with the rape.
}}

Another finding was that bad encounters increase when institutions work together. In over 40% of bad encounters with police, another institution was involved. Young people run away from hospitals, foster care, and other service systems because they are physically, emotionally, or sexually harmed or neglected. When police forcibly return someone to one of these settings, they place the young person back in the harmful situation they were escaping from.

An example of police working with another institution to scare a person away from getting help:

{{ quote
| text= I got hit on the head by someone on the train. The police took me to the hospital. The hospital tried to put me in the psych ward because I was transgender. They said I couldn't leave the hospital even though I didn't want to stay. They called the policeman back to try to force me to stay because they said I was a minor. I went to the bathroom then hid and left before they got there.
}}

The result was that the person never got the medical help they needed because of gender discrimination and fear of being put in a psych ward.

The researchers found that police frequently sexually assaulted youth in the sex trade. The following story, sex followed by arrest, was repeated many times:

{{ quote
| text= I was solicited by a police officer who said that if I had sex with him he wouldn't arrest me. So I did. Then afterwards he cuffed me and pressed charges anyway.
}}

Sometimes it was worse.

{{ quote
| text= I was going to meet a new john, it turned out to be a sting set up by the cops. He got violent with me, handcuffed me and then raped me. He cleaned me up for the police station and I got sentenced to four months in jail for prostitution.
}}

Young trans women profiled as prostitutes was another common story.

{{ quote
| text= I keep being arrested in Rogers Park just for standing still. They keep taking me in for prostitution even though I'm not doing anything at all. It's the same white cop doing it too.
}}

From the point of view of the young people in the study, the transition to an anti-trafficking regime hasn't made much difference.

{{ quote
| text= When being held in protective custody [because they said I was a victim of human trafficking] they started withholding my sheets, then towels, then pillows, then food because they said I wasn't telling them everything I could&amp;mdash;when in fact I was.
}}

And this:

{{ quote
| text= I was receiving a rape kit after a trafficking experience and the detective was questioning me and my advocate. The officer physically wouldn't let me out of the room. She threatened to send me and my advocate to jail unless we reported what happened [but I didn't want to tell her about my experience.] The officer got loud and in our faces, swore at us and made a big scene. I got between the officer and my advocate to get her out of my advocate's face. As soon as I could I ran out the door but the officer grabbed my arm so I pushed away and hid until I could get out of the hospital.

The sample consists of one hundred sixty nine respondents between the ages of thirteen and twenty four.

One respondent was given the choice between arrest and doing something "disgusting". She wouldn't tell the researcher what she was asked to do, but she told the other police officers at the station about it and they laughed at her.

A respondent was asked by an officer to show her breasts in order to avoid arrest. Another respondent had charges dropped because of police misconduct; the officer who arrested her had her perform oral sex on him.

Survey respondents said that police profiled transgender people as sex workers and subjected them to verbal abuse and sexual misconduct, including demands for sex in exchange for leniency. Police were arresting people for solicitation if they carried condoms. Even trans sex workers who weren't arrested for carrying condoms saw it happen to others and where afraid to carry condoms. Some police officers used possession of condoms to coerce trans sex workers into providing free sexual services. 

People who tested positive for HIV while in jail were visited by an HIV task force that scheduled appointments at a clinic. However, many people were rearrested before their scheduled appointment. One woman was arrested ten times in three years, preventing her from going to any scheduled appointments to receive care for her HIV infection during that period. Jail interrupts taking medication on a regular basis.

Transgender youth reported being picked up for prostitution or loitering for prostitution when they weren't working. One eighteen year old transgender youth reported being extorted for sex by police officers eight times. Once arrested, transgender youth were more likely to be sexually exploited by jail staff than cisgender youth were. 

Two quotes from cisgender respondents:

Police officers propositioned underage youth and made lewd comments. Most female youth in the study reported trading sex to avoid arrest. Pimps were not arrested or received less jail time than the youth that worked with them, even when one of the youths was identified as fourteen years old.

Abuse varied by location and police officer. Women were more likely to be arrested or ticketed in Brooklyn. Interactions with police in the Bronx were more likely to involve off-duty officers. However, a white woman in the Bronx reported that the police targeted her because she was white, telling her that she was making white people look bad. In Bushwick police harassment was so bad that a service organization was forced to change its location to protect its outreach staff. Latinas reported the worst harassment, including name-calling, stalking, and throwing food. A couple of women based in Bushwick reported daily harassment that caused them to avoid leaving their homes.

Examples of police language: 

{{ quote
| text= bitch

ho

slut

you're not dead yet?

we gotta go clean up the trash

why should we help you?
}}

A transwoman said she was subjected to constant harassment, and the officers who harassed her were the ones who wanted "oral sex on the side."

Thirty percent of the respondents reported threats of violence from the police, and twenty seven percent reported experiencing violence. One respondent said "I've seen cops get out of a car and beat a girl, and then get back in the car and leave." Another said that her greatest fear during arrest was "not coming home at all." The white woman from the Bronx said "... they throw you on the floor and they step on you..."

Another respondent reported seeing officers injure a women in the pelvic area to prevent her from working.
{{ quote
| text= ... it was like he was squeezing a handball or something, but really really hard... it was two guys in a car and they drove up on the sidewalk. He pushed her against the wall and then he pushed her against the wall after he finished that and then he said "now get off the street"...

One respondent reported that an officer followed her for thirty blocks in his civilian car. Another reported that an officer followed her and warned off clients with his bullhorn. Another reported that an officer felt her breasts and made her expose them as cars were driving by while he wrote a ticket. Some statements made by police officers to sex workers:

{{ quote
|text= It's hot tonight, it's a sweep, you should get out of here, now what can you do for me?

You wanna get arrested or you wanna give up some head?

I gave you two cigarettes, you want anything else, you know what you can do for me.

Can I rub against you for $10? [said during arrest]

Either you give me a blow job or I'm going to lock you up.

}}

Several respondents reported having money stolen while being searched or arrested.

A sampling of the false arrest stories:

*A respondent reported getting a summons while waiting to have her hair done. 

*A transwomen who was first arrested for prostitution at age fifteen reported that "I got arrested for prostitution long before I knew what prostitution was." She also said "... they just snatch you coming out of the subway, just because you're a tranny." 

*A ciswoman was approached in a park by an officer who checked and discovered that she had no outstanding warrants. He walked away and another officer approached her and arrested her. She was held for five hours before being released. By way of explanation, a police officer said "See this sheet? All these warrants aren't yours.[sic]"

*Another woman reported being stopped coming out of a grocery store. The police spilled her groceries on the ground and arrested her for prostitution.

This is an article from the Vice website. It opens with an ex-sex worker's story of false arrest; when she turned down an undercover officer's offer of money for sex, the police arrested her anyway. Because of being locked up, she missed a day of classes she needed to start a career outside of sex work. She informed the reporter that it's common for new officers to arrest women walking to the park where she was arrested, even though they're not working. One woman was arrested because the police said she was waving while wearing a low cut top and a miniskirt. Her attorney took pictures of her at arraignment wearing a jacket and pants and got the charges dropped. Another woman was arrested while wearing a peacoat and jeans that "outlined her legs."

A transwoman named Ryhannah Combs was picked up on prostitution charges while running errands. She was carrying no condoms but the arresting officer said she was carrying nine. Instead of being put in a cell, she was chained to a wall. The city settled when she sued.

A staff attorney at the Trafficking Victims Advocacy Project said that the police frequently verbally abused her clients when arresting them, and on multiple occasions have engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior.

Women who are addicted and becoming dope sick are targeted for sex. This was described as "a deal with the Devil," because the police officer will keep coming back for information, sex, or an easy arrest.

Study data was drawn from 1,400 client records from the Legal Aid Society's Exploitation Intervention Project. The researchers also interviewed twenty EIP clients who had had prostitution-related offenses cleared from their record.

Some of the study respondents had positive or neutral experiences with the police, but most of them had overwhelmingly negative experiences: verbal abuse, intimidation, humiliation, sexual harassment, and profiling.

Verbal abuse included slurs, derogatory comments, and refusal to use the person's native language, even when able to do so. Police used humiliation to extract cooperation. One trans woman described particularly intense humiliation, recurring with each arrest.

Some respondents had been propositioned by the police or had police as clients. One respondent described an officer who started off as a client. After their last session he came back the next day in his uniform and arrested her.

Some respondents reported repeated prostitution arrests by the same officer, even when the women weren't working. One woman was arrested while going to the store in pajamas and bedroom slippers. She described another arrest that occurred while she was meeting a cousin for dinner. She was charged even though the cousin came to the police station and told the police what they had been doing. One respondent described a police officer stating that he would lock her up if he saw her on the street.

Some respondents who were trafficked or victims of violence sought help from the police, only to be ridiculed or ignored.

The study sample was fifty two indoor sex workers.

63% of the respondents had police-initiated contact with the police, but 63% of those said the contact was rare. Only one person, a trans woman, had police-initiated contact as often as a couple of times a week. The police in her neighborhood knew her because she had previously worked outdoors. They harassed her, honking at her as she was walking down the street, telling her to go home or they would arrest her, and calling her "Mr." or "homeboy". Another trans woman said the police harassed her because she was transgender.

Several respondents said that during arrests, police took their pictures with personal cameras. They believed the pictures were for the officers' personal use. 12% of respondents had been falsely arrested at least once.

29% of respondents had been taken into custody but released without arrest. The researchers believe the lack of police follow up indicates that there was no basis for taking the people into custody.

14% of respondents had experienced police violence and felt they had no recourse. One woman said she was beaten twice, both times because she refused to give police officers free oral sex. The first time, after she bit the officer's penis, he beat her until she passed out. Another woman was having problems with a particularly violent officer:

{{ quote
| text= One likes to beat me now and then, or he wants me to suck his dick. I mean, it's crazy. He hits me with his gun and gives me these marks on my legs and my back. I don't know what to do...

I can't call the other cops. I did that once and they asked this guy to stop beating me. But he got so mad that he came around and beat me up even worse. So I really have to get out of here. Now he wants me to give him 25% of what I make...

I had to go to the hospital because I got beat so bad.

Four respondents said that police had stolen money. One said that police steal from her about once a year. Two respondents had $4,000 and a laptop stolen from them during an arrest.

16% of respondents said they had been in sexual situations with the police. Some had sex with the police for protection or because the officers were customers, but others were picked up by the police and given the choice between sex and arrest.

Some of the Latinos reported regular police harassment.

The study sample was two hundred eighty three young people selected through RDS.

Most of the respondents had been profiled, but only a small number were profiled for sex work. White and black youth were more likely to be profiled than Latinx. A black Dominican trans woman described moving into Manhattan and talking a walk around her new neighborhood. A police officer stopped her and told her she had better not be "on a stroll." At the time, she didn't know what a stroll was.

For interactions initiated by the police, 38.5% of survey respondents reported being humiliated or verbally abused by police during relatively minor interactions such as checking ID. One respondent said the officer called her a whore, prostitute, and trick. During 8.6% of these interactions, officers confiscated or destroyed safe sex supplies, including condoms. 17.3% of respondents said that police-initiated interactions involved the officer asking for sexual services, or demanding sexual services to avoid arrest. 9.1% of respondents reported being assaulted by police officers. 3 respondents reported strip searches.

Seventy eight respondents were profiled as sex workers and ordered to "move along." The most common result of this was that they ended up in an area where they felt less safe.

75% of trans people and 82.4% of Latinos said they were treated worse than others when they were in lock up.

When the survey respondents initiated contact with the police, usually to report a crime, in a number of cases the police tried to have sex with them. This seemed to be particularly true of trans Latinas.

This is an overview of the literature available at the time of publication on law enforcement abuse of various groups of women. There's a short discussion of sex workers at the end.

Police abuse of sex workers includes verbal insults, coerced sex, brutal beatings, and rape. When police know that a woman is a sex worker, they may harass her when she is not working. 

The most common abuses are verbal abuse and threats to arrest sex workers if the police don't receive sexual services. Police often assume that sex workers don't care who they will have sex with and will do anything to avoid arrest. But experienced street-based sex workers often refuse to provide free services. They are resigned to frequent arrests, including arrests for questionable charges. What they want to avoid are fear and indignity forced on them by bad officers.

One observer describes Chicago police picking up sex workers when the workers are on their way to and from work, and asking for sexual services. New York City police have threatened to shut down sex parlors if they didn't get free sexual services. Women picked up in raids have been taken away in their underwear and had their possessions confiscated.

Trans female sex workers face these and other more complex forms of abuse. If their official documentation doesn't match their gender presentation, they may face verbal abuse and cruel jokes centered around the difference. They may be subjected to unnecessary and illegal strip searches, ostensibly to determine their gender.

Police use sex work to profile people, stop them on the street, intimidate and question them, check for warrants, and often arrest them.

The discussion of sex work ends with the description of two rapes suffered by Mary Barr. In the first, a police officer chased off her client and then told her she might as well have sex with him because the client had already paid. In the second, an officer ordered her into the back seat of his car, told her "do what you do best," and then raped her.

Best Practices Policy Project, Desiree Alliance, and Sex Workers Outreach Project- NYC

2014-09-15

This was submitted as part of the UN Universal Periodic Review of the U.S.A.

During arrest or taking someone into custody, police often degrade or humiliate sex workers, including removing wigs or clothing, confiscating or destroying property, making homophobic, anti-transgender, and racists slurs, and engaging on sexual harassment. Organizations working with sex workers have documented a pattern of police practice that includes assault, sexual harassment, public strip searches for the purpose of viewing genitalia, and rape. This pattern of practice is supported by the difficulty or impossibility of obtaining justice in these cases. 

Police are able to extend this abuse from sex workers to trans women and women of color by profiling them as sex workers. A study in Los Angeles of Latina trans women found that 42% reported being solicited for sex by law enforcement and 24% reported being sexually abused by police officers.

When sex workers try to report crimes against them, officers don't take their complaints seriously, refuse to file a report, and may arrest them, physically assault them, or pressure them for sex. When a sex worker tried to bring charges against a security guard who handcuffed and raped her, the police referred to the guard as "a big teddy bear", and added exculpatory statements to her report that she didn't make. This refusal to deal with crimes against sex workers leads serial killers to target sex workers and people profiled as sex workers.

While most witnesses who are in danger because of their testimony are put in witness protection programs, sex workers are pressured to testify by putting them in jail, exposing them to witness intimidation and denying them their right to liberty. An African-American trans female sex worker was placed in the mens' jail in Baltimore in an effort to compel her to testify in a violent crime case. Police in some areas force sex workers to participate in drug stings, exposing them to violence from the people targeted by the stings.

In New York, transgender and gender non-conforming people are often profiled as sex workers and arrested. They then have to decide whether to request being held as a "special category" prisoner. If they make the request, police are often harsh, holding them alone in a back cell longer than usual or assaulting them. If no empty cells are available, police chain them to a desk or metal bar, often for hours at a time. If they don't make the request, they may be put in a cell where they aren't safe, or the police may incite trouble with the other prisoners by saying "here's another [anti-LGBT slur] for you."

Police discourage the use of condoms by using condoms as evidence, or they destroy condoms and safe sex supplies. This encourages the spread of HIV and STIs. Carrying condoms may also be a signal for sexual harassment, cuing police to ask intrusive questions about sexual orientation and gender identity, touch inappropriately, and make disparaging comments. Police particularly target young women of color and trans youth and gender non-conforming youth of color.

Sex workers with severe injuries from violent attacks are often belittled and blamed for the attacks, and police often don't escort them or refer them to medical care. People in medical facilities seeking care for injuries from attacks have been accusingly questioned by police officers when they were profiled as sex workers.

The study sample consisted of fifteen woman who were sex workers, trafficked victims, or both.

Six of the twelve women who had been trafficking victims left their trafficking situation without help from law enforcement, through the help of a coworker or an attorney they met through a coworker or friend. Nationwide, it appears that the majority of trafficking victims escape without the involvement of law enforcement. One supervisor in a national organization said that 90% of their cases were not produced by raids or identified by law enforcement.

(N.b. Most people who fit the legal definition of trafficking victim seem to exit trafficking without any organizational help. In a study of underage sex workers in NYC, only 2% said they would ever go to a service organization if they were in trouble.&lt;ref name="curtisNYC"/&gt; On the whole, they age out of sex work rather than being "rescued." Young sex workers studied in NYC and Atlantic City experienced greater control over their work over time, regardless of whether they had pimps.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Overall, it appears that the majority of people who fall under the category of trafficking victim exit the category through their own efforts. Only a minority of trafficking victims exit trafficking with help from organizations created to help them. Of that minority, only a further minority, perhaps 10%, are identified by law enforcement. And this study suggests that most of the people picked up in raids could have been rescued or self-rescued in other, less traumatic ways, had they been aware of the help available to them.)

Of the six trafficking victims picked up in law enforcement raids, one would have left her situation in a few days if she had not been picked up in a raid and arrested. As a result of the raid, she was pistol-whipped by a police officer and incarcerated. Her conclusion:

{{ quote
| text= A better way to help leave my situation would be anything that didn't involve the police.
}}

Another would have left on her own if she had known where to go, and another said that she would have preferred leaving with a coworker rather than being picked up in a raid. One didn't know another way to escape, but still thought the raid was "terrible." Had these women known of the resources available to trafficked people, they very likely could have left on their own and gotten the assistance they needed without the trauma or injury of a raid.

Raids often involve intimidation, verbal abuse, excessive force, and sexual harassment. Raids result in detention and deportation of trafficking victims who are afraid to come forward, or who come forward and aren't believed. Victims who aren't detained or deported are often terrorized into silence. 

The respondents who experienced raids didn't know which government agency was raiding them, and in one case initially knew only that they were being attacked by people carrying guns. They didn't know what purpose the raids had, other than to detain and deport them, and they didn't know what was going to happen to them.

The women who left trafficking situations on their own, without being traumatized by a law enforcement raid, were better able to cooperate in the prosecution of their traffickers.

'''Polyglossia''' (pronunciation: /ˌpɒlɪˈɡlɒsɪə/)is a [[noun]] that refers to the coexistence of multiple [[language]]s (or distinct varieties of the same language) in one [[society]] or area. It was first used in the 1970s in the [[Academic journal]] "[[International Migration Review]]".
Polyglossia is a useful term for describing situations where more than two distinct varieties are used for clearly distinct purposes.

[[File:Pdm cover.jpg|thumb|right]]
The '''''Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual''''' ('''PDM''') is a diagnostic handbook similar to the [[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD) or the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM). The PDM was published on May 28, 2006.

The information contained in the PDM was collected by a collaborative task force which includes members of the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]], the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]], the Division of Psychoanalysis (Division 39) of the [[American Psychological Association]], the [[American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry]], and the National Membership Committee on Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work.

Although it is based on current neuroscience and treatment outcome studies, Carey (2006) points out that many of the concepts in the PDM are adapted from the classical [[psychoanalytic]] tradition of psychotherapy. For example, the PDM indicates that the [[anxiety disorders]] may be traced to the "four basic danger situations" described by [[Sigmund Freud]] (1926)&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;{{cite book|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|title=The Collected Works of Sigmund Freud|year=1926|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|location=Vol 20|edition=Standard|chapter=Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxiety}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as the loss of a significant other; the loss of love; the loss of body integrity; and the loss of affirmation by one's own conscience.&lt;ref name=Carey&gt;{{cite news|last=Carey|first=Benedict|title=For Therapy, a New Guide With a Touch of Personality|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a new perspective on the existing diagnostic system as it enables clinicians to describe and categorize personality patterns, related social and emotional capacities, unique mental profiles, and personal experiences of the patient.&lt;ref name=Etnyre&gt;{{cite journal|last=Etnyre|first=W|title=Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual|journal=Journal of Clinical Social Work|year=2008|volume=36|pages=403–406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PDM is not intended to compete with the DSM or ICD. The authors report the work emphasizes "individual variations as well as commonalities" by "focusing on the full range of mental functioning" and serves as a "[complement to] the DSM and ICD efforts in cataloguing [sic] symptoms.&lt;ref name="HomePage"&gt;{{cite web|last=PDM Task Force|title=Home Page|url=http://www.pdm1.org/index.htm|publisher=Alliance of Psychoanalytic Organizations|accessdate=9 January 2013|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The task force intends for the PDM to augment the existing diagnostic taxonomies by providing "a multi dimensional approach to describe the intricacies of the patient's overall functioning and ways of engaging in the therapeutic process.".&lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;{{cite web|last=PDM Task Force|title=Introduction|url=http://www.pdm1.org/intro.htm|publisher=Alliance of Psychoanalytic Organizations|accessdate=9 January 2013|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taxonomy ==

=== Dimension I: Personality Patterns and Disorders ===

This first dimension classifies personality patterns in two domains.  First, it looks at the spectrum of personality types and places the person's personality on a continuum from unhealthy and maladaptive to healthy and adaptive. Second, it classifies the how the person "organizes mental functioning and engages the world".&lt;ref name="HomePage" /&gt;

The task force adds, "This dimension has been placed first in the PDM system because of the accumulating evidence that symptoms or problems cannot be understood, assessed, or treated in the absence of an understanding of the mental life of the person who has the symptoms".&lt;ref name="HomePage" /&gt;  In other words, a list of symptoms characteristic of a diagnosis does not adequately inform a clinician how to understand and treat the symptoms without proper context.  By analogy, if a patient went to her physician complaining of watering eyes and a runny nose, the symptoms alone do not indicate the appropriate treatment.  Her symptoms could be a function of seasonal allergies, a bacterial sinus infection, the common cold, or she may have just come from her grandmother's funeral.  The doctor might treat allergies with an antihisamine, the sinus infection with antibiotics, the cold with zinc, and give her patient a Kleenex tissue after the funeral.  All four conditions may have very similar symptoms; all four condition are treated very differently.

=== Dimension II: Mental Functioning ===
Next, the PDM provides a "detailed description of emotional functioning" which are understood to be "the capacities that contribute to an individual's personality and overall level of psychological health or pathology".&lt;ref name="HomePage" /&gt;  This dimension provides a "microscopic" examination of the patient's mental life by systematically accounting for their functional capacity to
* Process information
* Self-regulate
* Establish and maintain relationships
* Experience, organize, and express feelings and emotions at different levels
* Represent, differentiate, and integrate experience
* Utilize appropriate coping strategies and defense mechanisms
* Accurately observe oneself and others
* Form internal values and standards

=== Dimension III: Manifest Symptoms and Concerns ===

The third dimension starts with the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic categories; moreover, beyond simply listing symptoms, the PDM "goes on to describe the affective states, cognitive processes, somatic experiences, and relational patterns most often associated clinically" with each diagnosis.&lt;ref name="HomePage" /&gt;  In this dimension, "symptom clusters" are "useful descriptors" which presents the patient's "symptom patterns in terms of the patient's personal experience of his or her prevailing difficulties".&lt;ref name="HomePage" /&gt;  The task force concludes, "The patient may evidence a few or many patterns, which may or may not be related, and which should be seen in the context of the person's personality and mental functioning.  The multi dimensional approach... provides a systematic way to describe patients that is faithful to their complexity and helpful in planning appropriate treatments".&lt;ref name="HomePage" /&gt;

== The new edition (PDM-2) ==
Guilford Press will be publishing a new edition of the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual (PDM-2), which is being developed by a steering committee composed by [[Vittorio Lingiardi]] (Editor), [[Nancy McWilliams]] (Editor), and [[Robert S. Wallerstein]] (Honorary Chair). Guilford Press received a manuscript for PDM-2 in September 2016, and the current release date is set for June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Guilford Press Customer Service&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Repurposing''' is the process by which an object with one [[use value]] is transformed or redeployed as an object with an alternative use value.

==Description==
Repurposing is as old as [[human civilization]], with many contemporary scholars investigating that way that different societies re-appropriate the artifacts of older cultures in new and creative ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/04/medieval-recycling/ | title=Medieval Recycling | publisher=Harvard Gazette | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, repurposing has been celebrated by 21st century hobbyists and arts-and-crafts organizations such as [[Instructables]] and other [[Maker culture]] communities as a means of creatively responding to the ecological and economic crises of the 21st century.  Recent scholarship has attempted to relate these activities to American left- and right-[[libertarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Malewitz, R. (2014) {{cite web | url=http://www-sup.stanford.edu/book.cgi?id=22814 | title=The Practice of Misuse | publisher=Stanford University Press | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www-sup.stanford.edu/book.cgi?id=3195 | title=Throwaways: Work Culture and Consumer Education | publisher=Stanford University Press | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repurposing is the use of a tool being re-channeled into being another tool, usually for a purpose unintended by the original tool-maker. Typically, repurposing is done using items usually considered to be junk, garbage, or obsolete. A good example of this would be the [[Earthship]] style of house, that uses tires as insulating walls and bottles as glass walls. Reuse is not limited to repeated uses for the same purpose.  Examples of repurposing include using tires as [[boat fender]]s and [[steel drum]]s or plastic drums as [[feeding trough]]s and/or composting bins. [[Incinerator]] and power plant exhaust stack [[fly-ash]] is used extensively as an [[concrete additive|additive to concrete]], providing increased strength. This type of reuse can sometimes make use of items which are no longer usable for their original purposes, for example using worn-out clothes as [[Textile|rags]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.diyncrafts.com/6081/repurpose/100-ways-repurpose-reuse-broken-household-items | title=100 Ways to Repurpose and Reuse Broken Household Items | publisher=DIY &amp; Crafts | accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all repurposing is necessarily environmentally friendly, take for instance the idea of repurposing older work trucks for businesses in their infancy, in which their poor fuel economy can negate long term benefits since greater spending of money for fuel, and more fumes output to the sky can prove to be environmentally unfriendly, in which repurposing vehicles for [[Electric vehicle conversion|electric car conversion]] can be the recommended alternative to that, though its cost can be negligible upfront.

==Examples==

[[File:WestBankCowbell.jpg|thumb|An improvised [[cowbell]], used for sheep or goats. The bell was found in 1988 in a field near [[Tuqu']] (Tekoa) in the Judean hills, the West Bank. The bell's body is made of aluminum, probably a broken kitchen utensil, while the clapper is a brass cartridge case (SMI 25 NATO, probably 7.62×51mm).]]

===Automobiles===
*[[Full-size van]]s from the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]] which have been used for airport shuttle service have been repurposed as church vans mainly because of some [[depreciation]] to facilitate affordable cost for thrifty church groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://enrichmentjournal.ag.org/200401/200401_54_sb6_vans.cfm | title=What Church Leaders Should Know About Church Vans | publisher=Enrichment Journal | accessdate=3 August 2014 | author=Hammar, Richard R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronics===
*A [[USB dead drop]] can be mounted on a [[brick wall]] since this gives an opportunity to repurpose older USB flash drives with obsolete capacities to continue service for file transfer (especially anonymous ones) that don't demand more than one [[gigabyte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deaddrops.com/dead-drops/participate/ |title=How to make your own |publisher=Deaddrops.com |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Everdrive]] and other flash video game cartridges have offered opportunities to download [[ROM image]]s of video game cartridges onto [[SD card]]s while offering opportunities to repurpose real vintage video game consoles for retro gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130329014653/http://www.stoneagegamer.com/mega-everdrive-deluxe.html Stoneagegamer's article on the Everdrive]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Old Android smartphones, which tend to have little computing resources yet which are unused and probably contain a triaxial [[accelerometer]] of decent specifications, can be used as an amateur seismograph node for a distributed seismography project, e.g., [[Quake-Catcher Network]].
*Discarded or new consumer COTS surplus parabolic reflectors intended for use for C band satellite TV reception can be repurposed for a wide gamut of applications for which a consumer-grade reflector of low gain is adequate, incl. amateur microwave SETI (mainly [[Project Argus]]), Wi-Fi links, and microwave [[amateur radio]] [[radio beacons]].

===As a tactic for manufacturing goods===
* [[Right-hand-drive]] [[Jeep]] brand vehicles, such as the [[Jeep Wrangler]], which are initially slated for import to right-hand-drive countries, have had some specially designed versions repurposed for US and Canada [[postal service]] mail carrying, in which this tactic of repurposing can consolidate the overhead of retooling for specialty manufacturing of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rightdrivejeeps4postal.com/ US Drive Right: The Nation's Largest Seller Of Used Factory
Right Hand Drive Vehicles For Postal Carriers&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacturing of recycled goods===
*[[Reusable packaging]] can be reused for a wide variety of other purposes.
* [[Recycling]] can also involve repurposing of materials, such as products using [[recycled paper]].&lt;ref name="debunking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Debunking the Myths of Recycled Paper|url=http://recyclingpoint.com.sg/Articles/feb1992myth_of_recycledpaper.htm|publisher=Recycling Point Dot Com|accessdate=4 February 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006094659/http://www.recyclingpoint.com.sg/Articles/feb1992myth_of_recycledpaper.htm |archivedate = 6 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drugs===

The term was first used specifically in reference to the practice by [[Five Eyes]] member, the [[National Security Agency]] of the United States of America. It is unclear how often these programs and methods are used in comparison to other Five Eyes initiatives such as [[Optic Nerve (GCHQ)]], [[MUSCULAR]], and [[XKEYSCORE]].

The extent to which SEXINT itself is used is unknown. Targets who have come forward are few and far between. While first-hand accounts are rare it is confirmed that 6 people, all followers of [[Islam|Muslim]]s not involved in any terror plots, were demonstrated as potential targets of this method for their influence on the popular video hosting site [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]] and other social media websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/26/nsa-porn-muslims_n_4346128.html|title=Top-Secret Document Reveals NSA Spied On Porn Habits As Part Of Plan To Discredit ‘Radicalizers’|last=Greenwald|first=Glen|date=November 26, 2013|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=May 7, 2014|last2=Grim|first2=Ryan|last3=Gallagher|first3=Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related abuses ==

The National Security Agency has been able to keep most specific instances of abuse of intel such as SEXINT under [[secret]]. A few reports have slipped through, including an employee able to use the related tactic of gathering [[LOVEINT]] to search for his ex-girlfriend on his first day of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/09/loveint-on-his-first-day-of-work-nsa-employee-spied-on-ex-girlfriend/|title=LOVEINT: On his first day of work, NSA employee spied on ex-girlfriend|last=Farivar|first=Cyrus|date=September 27, 2013|work=Ars Technica|access-date=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been much controversy over whether or not agencies such as the National Security Agency have been spying on American citizens. In early May 2014 [[Edward Snowden]] stated that American citizens are watched more closely than anyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/58451/edward-snowden-nsa-spies-most-americans|title=Edward Snowden: NSA Spies Most on Americans|last=Volz|first=Dustin|date=April 30, 2014|work=National Journal|access-date=May 7, 2014|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''SPEAK FREE Act of 2015''' (H.R. 2304) is a [[Bipartisanship|bipartisan]] [[Act of Congress]] that was introduced on May 13, 2015, designed to serve as federal anti-SLAPP legislation, to protect free speech in practice. Its title is an [[acronym]] (S.P.E.A.K. F.R.E.E.) that stands for "'''Securing Participation, Engagement, and Knowledge Freedom by Reducing Egregious Efforts Act of 2015'''".&lt;ref name=congress-speakfree /&gt;

== Details ==

The Bill was designed to prevent [[Strategic lawsuit against public participation|SLAPP]] lawsuits (strategic lawsuit against public participation), which are often brought to silence critics.&lt;ref name=anti-slapp-speakfreeact /&gt;&lt;ref name=washingtonpost-2016-12-8-elliott /&gt; SLAPP suits are used as legal [[retaliation]],&lt;ref name=thehill-2015-11-27-shapiro /&gt; by burdening them with the costs of a [[legal defense]], until they abandon their criticism.&lt;ref name=anti-slapp-speakfreeact /&gt;&lt;ref name=washingtonpost-2016-12-8-elliott /&gt;&lt;ref name=onthemedia-2010-4-2-rafsanjani /&gt;

== Background ==

In response to several [[Strategic lawsuit against public participation#United States 2|notable SLAPP abuses]] in recent times, [[United States House of Representatives|United States Representative]] [[Blake Farenthold]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Texas|TX]]),&lt;ref name=house-farenthold-speakfreeact /&gt; along with 20 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and 11 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] co-sponsors,&lt;ref name=congress-speakfree-cosponsors /&gt; introduced the SPEAK FREE Act to dismiss lawsuits which are used to harass plaintiffs.&lt;ref name=techdirt-2015-5-13-masnick /&gt; The SPEAK FREE Act was formed by observing what has been shown to work, after being previously implemented in over twenty States where anti-SLAPP legislation had already been tested.&lt;ref name=thehill-2016-9-12-godwin /&gt;

With the looming prospect that [[Donald Trump]] might become [[President of the United States|President]], [[United States Congress|Congress]] decided to address the SPEAK FREE Act, with the Bill's sponsor, Rep. Farenthold (R), stating, "[[Barack Obama|Obama]] will sign this. I don’t think Trump will."&lt;ref name=politico-2016-6-1-scola /&gt;&lt;ref name=nymag-2016-6-levitz /&gt;&lt;ref name=cnpa-shepard-donald-trump-libel-laws /&gt;

== Judiciary hearing ==

On June 22, 2016, the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]] held a hearing on the Bill. Witnesses who gave testimony included Aaron Schur (Senior Director of Litigation of [[Yelp]]), Bruce Brown ([[Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press]]), [[Alexander A. Reinert]] (Professor of Law at [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law|Cardozo]]), and Laura Prather (partner of [[Haynes and Boone, LLP]]).&lt;ref name=house-judiciary-speakfreeact /&gt;&lt;ref name=rcfp-2016-6-23-sadurni /&gt;&lt;ref name=corpcounsel-2016-9-26-williams-alvarez /&gt;

== Response ==

The Bill was praised for its bipartisan support in protecting free speech by the Public Participation Project,&lt;ref name=speakfree-openletter /&gt; the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]],&lt;ref name=speakfree-openletter /&gt;&lt;ref name=eff-2015-5-21-cope /&gt; and [[Yelp]],&lt;ref name=speakfree-openletter /&gt;&lt;ref name=motherjones-2015-6-20-harkinson /&gt; among others, as the Bill is also geared toward protecting online criticism.&lt;ref name=motherjones-2015-6-20-harkinson /&gt;&lt;ref name=broadcasting&amp;cable-2015-5-13-eggerton /&gt;

In the math branches of [[differential geometry]] and [[vector calculus]], the '''second [[covariant derivative]]''', or the '''second order covariant derivative''', of a vector field is the derivative of its derivative with respect to another two [[tangent vector]] fields. Formally, given a (pseudo)-Riemannian [[manifold]] (''M'', ''g'') associated with a [[vector bundle]] ''E'' → ''M'', let ∇ denote the [[Levi-Civita connection]] given by the metric ''g'', and denote by Γ(''E'') the space of the [[smoothness|smooth]] [[Section (fiber bundle)|sections]] of the total space ''E''. Denote by ''T&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;M'' the [[cotangent bundle]] of ''M''. Then the second covariant derivative can be defined as the [[function composition|composition]] of the two ∇s as follows: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Thomas H.|title=Geometry Primer|url=http://www.math.msu.edu/~parker/ga/geometryprimer.pdf|accessdate=2 January 2015}}, pp. 7&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(E) \stackrel{\nabla}{\longrightarrow} \Gamma(T^*M \otimes E) \stackrel{\nabla}{\longrightarrow} \Gamma(T^*M \otimes T^*M \otimes E).&lt;/math&gt;
For example, given vector fields ''u'', ''v'', ''w'', a second [[covariant derivative]] can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;(\nabla^2_{u,v} w)^a = u^c v^b \nabla_c \nabla_b w^a&lt;/math&gt;
by using [[abstract index notation]]. It is also straightforward to verify that
:&lt;math&gt;(\nabla_u \nabla_v w)^a = u^c \nabla_c v^b \nabla_b w^a = u^c v^b \nabla_c \nabla_b w^a + (u^c \nabla_c v^b) \nabla_b w^a = (\nabla^2_{u,v} w)^a + (\nabla_{\nabla_u v} w)^a.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2_{u,v} w = \nabla_u \nabla_v w - \nabla_{\nabla_u v} w.&lt;/math&gt;
When the [[torsion tensor]] is zero, so that &lt;math&gt;[u,v]= \nabla_uv-\nabla_vu&lt;/math&gt;, we   may use this fact to write [[Riemann curvature tensor]] as  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Jean Gallier]] and Dan Guralnik|title=Chapter 13: Curvature in Riemannian Manifolds|url=http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis610/diffgeom5.pdf|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R(u,v) w=\nabla^2_{u,v} w - \nabla^2_{v,u} w.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, one may also obtain the second covariant derivative of a function ''f'' as
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2_{u,v} f = u^c v^b \nabla_c \nabla_b f = \nabla_u \nabla_v f - \nabla_{\nabla_u v} f.&lt;/math&gt;
Again, for the  torsion-free    Levi-Civita connection, and   for any vector fields ''u'' and ''v'', when we  feed the function ''f'' into  both sides of 
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_u v - \nabla_v u = [u, v]&lt;/math&gt;
we  find 
:&lt;math&gt;(\nabla_u v - \nabla_v u)(f) = [u, v](f) = u(v(f)) - v(u(f)).&lt;/math&gt;.
This can be rewritten as 
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\nabla_u v} f - \nabla_{\nabla_v u} f = \nabla_u \nabla_v f - \nabla_v \nabla_u f,&lt;/math&gt;
so we have 
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2_{u,v} f = \nabla^2_{v,u} f.&lt;/math&gt;
That is, the value of the second covariant derivative of a function is independent on the order of taking derivatives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43645">'''Self-compassion''' is extending [[compassion]] to one's self in instances of perceived inadequacy, failure, or general [[suffering]]. [[Kristin Neff]] has defined self-compassion as being composed of three main components – self-kindness, common humanity, and [[mindfulness]].&lt;ref name="neff-a"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/15298860309027 | last1 = Neff | first1 = K. D. | year = 2003a | title = The development and validation of a scale to measure self-compassion | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 223–250 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.362.5757 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Self-kindness: Self-compassion [[logical consequence|entails]] being warm towards oneself when encountering pain and personal shortcomings, rather than ignoring them or hurting oneself with self-criticism.
*Common humanity: Self-compassion also involves recognizing that suffering and personal failure is part of the shared human experience.
*[[Mindfulness]]: Self-compassion requires taking a balanced approach to one's negative emotions so that feelings are neither suppressed nor exaggerated.  Negative thoughts and emotions are observed with openness, so that they are held in mindful awareness. Mindfulness is a non-judgmental, receptive mind state in which individuals observe their thoughts and feelings as they are, without trying to suppress or deny them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.84.4.822 | last1 = Brown | first1 = K.

Self-compassion has been considered to resemble [[Carl Rogers]]' notion of "[[unconditional positive regard]]" applied both towards clients and oneself; [[Albert Ellis]]' "unconditional self-acceptance"; Maryhelen Snyder's notion of an "internal empathizer" that explored one's own experience with "curiosity and compassion"; [[Ann Weiser Cornell]]'s notion of a [[Inner Relationship Focusing#Description|gentle, allowing relationship]] with all parts of one's being; and [[Judith V. Jordan|Judith Jordan]]'s concept of ''self-empathy'', which implies acceptance, care and [[empathy]] towards the self.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Buck, David Lukoff: [http://www.spiritualcompetency.com/scrcQuiz.aspx?courseID=65 Self-Compassion i: Spiritual and Psychological Roots] (course description), SCRC&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-compassion is different from [[self-pity]], a state of mind or emotional response of a person believing to be a victim and lacking the confidence and competence to [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] with an adverse situation.

Research indicates that self-compassionate individuals experience greater [[psychological health]] than those who lack self-compassion.  For example, self-compassion is positively associated with [[life satisfaction]], [[wisdom]], [[happiness]], [[optimism]], [[curiosity]], learning goals, [[social connectedness]], personal responsibility, and [[emotional resilience]].  At the same time, it is associated with a lower tendency for [[self-criticism]], depression, [[anxiety]], [[Rumination (psychology)|rumination]], [[thought suppression]], [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]], and disordered eating attitudes.&lt;ref name="neff-a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, C.

Self-compassion has different effects than [[self-esteem]], a subjective emotional evaluation of the self. Although psychologists extolled the benefits of self-esteem for many years, recent research has exposed costs associated with the pursuit of high self-esteem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.130.3.392 | last1 = Crocker | first1 = J. | last2 = Park | first2 = L.

D &amp; Vonk, R. (submitted). ''Self-compassion versus self-esteem:  Two different ways of relating to oneself.''  Manuscript submitted for publication.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scales ==
Much of the research conducted on self-compassion so far has used the Self-Compassion Scale, created by [[Kristin Neff]], which measures the degree to which individuals display self-kindness against self-judgment, common humanity versus [[Isolation (psychology)|isolation]], and [[mindfulness]] versus over-identification.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Self-Compassion Scale has been translated into different languages. Some of these include a Czech,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benda | first1 = J. | last2 = Reichová | first2 = A. | year = 2016 | title = Psychometric characteristics of the Czech version of the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS- CZ) | journal = Československá Psychologie | volume = 60 | issue = 2 | pages = 120–136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Japanese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arimitsu | first1 = K | year = 2014 | title = Development and validation of the japanese version of the self-compassion scale | url = | journal = Japanese Journal of Psychology | volume = 85 | issue = 1| pages = 50–59 | doi=10.4992/jjpsy.85.50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = J. | last2 = Yan | first2 = L. | last3 = Zhou | first3 = L. | year = 2011 | title = Reliability and validity of chinese version of self-compassion scale | url = | journal = Chinese Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 19 | issue = 6| pages = 734–736 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deniz | first1 = M.

=== Development ===
The original sample for which the scale was developed consisted of 68 undergraduate students from a large university in the United States. In this experiment, the participants narrowed down the potential scale items to 71.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neff | first1 = K. D. | year = 2003a | title = The development and validation of a scale to measure self-compassion | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 223–250 | doi=10.1080/15298860309027| citeseerx = 10.1.1.362.5757 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next stage of development involved testing the [[Reliability (psychometrics)|reliability]] and [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] of the scale among a larger group of participants. During this research study, 391 undergraduate students were selected at random to complete the 71 previously narrowed down scale items.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Based on their results, the number of items was reduced to 26.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The self-compassion scales have good reliability and validity.&lt;ref name="Van Dam"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Dam | first1 = N. T. | last2 = Sheppard | first2 = S.C. | last3 = Forsyth | first3 = J.P. | last4 = Earleywine | first4 = M. | year = 2011 | title = Self-compassion is a better predictor than mindfulness of symptom severity and quality of life in mixed anxiety and depression | doi = 10.1016/j.janxdis.2010.08.011 | pmid = 20832990 | journal = Journal of Anxiety Disorders | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 123–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second study was conducted to look more closely at the difference between [[self-esteem]] and self-compassion. This study consisted of 232 randomly selected, undergraduate students.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Participants were asked to complete a number of different scales in [[questionnaire]] form. They were as follows: The 26-item Self-compassion Scale, the 10-item [[Rosenberg self-esteem scale|Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale]], the 10-item Self-determination Scale, the 21-item Basic Psychological Needs Scale, and the 40-item [[Narcissistic Personality Inventory]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Based on the findings, Neff reports "that self-compassion and [[self-esteem]] were measuring two different psychological phenomena."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A third study was conducted to examine the [[construct validity]]. By comparing two different groups of people, researchers would be able to see the different levels of self-compassion. Forty-three [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] practitioners completed the Self-compassion Scale as well as a [[self-esteem]] scale.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The sample of 232 undergraduate students from the second study was used as the comparison group. As expected by Neff, the Buddhist practitioners had significantly higher self-compassion scores than the students.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Self-compassion scale  ===
The long version of the Self-compassion scale (SCS) consists of 26 items. This includes 6 subscales – self-kindness, self-judgement, common humanity, [[isolation (psychology)|isolation]], [[mindfulness]], and over-identification. Neff recommends this scale for ages 14 and up with a minimum 8th grade reading level.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

Presented on a [[Likert scale]], ranging from 1 (almost no self-compassion) to 5 (constant self-compassion), those completing the SCS are able to gain insight on how they respond to themselves during a struggle or challenging time.&lt;ref name="Van Dam"/&gt;

A shorter, Dutch version of the SCS scale has been developed that uses 24 items.&lt;ref name="Van Dam"/&gt;

=== Short form  ===
The short version of the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS-SF) consists of 12 items and is available in Dutch and English.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Research reveals that the short form scale can be used competently as a substitute for the long form scale.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Raes | first1 = F. | last2 = Pommier | first2 = E. | last3 = Neff | first3 = K. D. | last4 = Van Gucht | first4 = D. | year = 2011 | title = Construction and factorial validation of a short form of the Self-Compassion Scale | url = | journal = Clinical Psychology &amp; Psychotherapy | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 250–255 | doi=10.1002/cpp.702| pmid = 21584907 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted at the University of Leuven, Belgium concluded that when examining total scores, this shorter version provides an almost perfect correlation with the longer version.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Six-factor model ===
Neff's scale proposes three interacting components of self-compassion, which are each composed of two opposite facets. The first dimension is self-kindness versus self-judgment. Self-kindness refers to one's ability to be kind and understanding of oneself, whereas self-judgement refers to being critical and harsh towards oneself. The second dimension is common humanity versus isolation. Common humanity refers to one's ability to recognize that they are part of a related group of others and that suffering is part of the human condition. The third dimension is mindfulness versus over-identification. Mindfulness refers to one's awareness and acceptance of painful experiences in a balanced and non-judgmental way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://self-compassion.org/the-three-elements-of-self-compassion-2/|title = Self-Compassion|date = 2015|accessdate = 3 August 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Neff|first = Kristin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neff describes these three dimensions interacting to enhance and engender one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Self-Compassion: An Alternative Conceptualization of a Healthy Attitude Toward Oneself|last = Neff|first = Kristin|date = 2003|journal = Psychology Press|doi = 10.1080/15298860309032|pmid = |volume=2|issue = 2|pages=85–101|citeseerx = 10.1.1.616.6302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticisms of Neff's scale ===
Currently, Kristin Neff's Self-Compassion Scale is the only self-report instrument used to measure self-compassion. Although it is widely accepted as being a reliable and valid tool to measure self-compassion, recent research has posed questions regarding the scale's generalizability and its use of a six-factor model.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Reconsideration of the Self-Compassion Scale's Total Score: Self-Compassion versus Self-Criticism|last = Lopez|first = Angelica|date = 20 July 2015|journal = PLOS ONE|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0132940|pmid = 26193654|volume=10|issue = 7|pages=e0132940|pmc=4508060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Generalizability ====
The generalizability of Neff's Self-Compassion Scale can be questioned; although the scale is used to measure self-compassion in the general population and has been translated into many languages, the scale itself has mostly been tested on college students.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Six-factor model ====
A recent study performed by Angélica López et al. examined the factor structure, reliability, and construct validity of Neff's Self-compassion Scale using a large representative sample from the general population. The study consisted of 1,736 participants and used both a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine if Neff's six-factor structure could be replicated.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Lopez's study could not replicate the six-factor structure of Neff's Self-compassion Scale, but rather suggested a two-factor model of the scale, created by grouping the positive and negative items separately. Lopez's study also suggests it is important to view self-compassion and self-criticism as being distinct from one another, traits that Neff's Self-compassion Scale assumes are opposites. Lopez's study makes it clear that there is room for further research into the validity of the six-factor structure used by Neff's Self-compassion Scale.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Exercises ==
Self-compassion exercises generally consist of either a writing exercise, role-playing, or introspective contemplation, and are designed to foster self-kindness, mindfulness, and feelings of common humanity. Self-compassion exercises have been shown to be effective in increasing self-compassion, along with increases in self-efficacy, optimism, and mindfulness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Meeting Suffering With Kindness: Effects of a Brief Self-Compassion Intervention for Female College Students|journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology|date = 2014-01-01|volume = 70|issue = 9|doi = 10.1002/jclp.22076|pmid = 24691680|first = Elke|last = Smeets|first2 = Kristin|last2 = Neff|first3 = Hugo|last3 = Alberts|first4 = Madelon|last4 = Peters|pages=794–807}}&lt;/ref&gt; These exercises have also been shown to decrease rumination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In individuals who were vulnerable to depression, one week of daily self-compassion exercises lead to reduced depression up to three months following the exercise, and increased happiness up to six months following the exercise, regardless of the pre-exercise levels of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The benefits of self-compassion and optimism exercises for individuals vulnerable to depression|journal = The Journal of Positive Psychology|date = 2010-09-01|issn = 1743-9760|pages = 377–389|volume = 5|issue = 5|doi = 10.1080/17439760.2010.516763|first = Leah B.|last = Shapira|first2 = Myriam|last2 = Mongrain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== How would you treat a friend? ===
This exercise asks the user to imagine that they are comforting a close friend who is going through a tough situation. The user is then asked to compare and contrast how they react internally to their own struggles, and to endeavour applying the same loving kindness to themselves that they would apply to a friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 1: How would you treat a friend?|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-1-treat-friend/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-compassion break ===
This exercise is to be used during times of acute distress. The user is asked to focus on a stressful event or situation. Then, the user is asked to repeat several prompts to themselves, each of which emphasizes one of the three main tenets of self-compassion: [[mindfulness]], [[common humanity]], and self-kindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 1: How would you treat a friend?|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-2-self-compassion-break/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exploring through writing ===
In this exercise, the user is asked to focus on a facet of themself that they believe to be an imperfection, and that makes them feel inadequate. Once they have brought this issue to mind, they are asked to write a letter to themself from the perspective of an unconditionally loving imaginary friend. The user is then asked to focus on the soothing and comforting feelings of compassion that they have generated for themself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 3: Exploring self-compassion through writing|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-3-exploring-self-compassion-writing/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticizer, criticized, and compassionate observer ===
This exercise asks the user to occupy several "chairs" during the course of the practice. Initially, they are asked to occupy the chair of the self-critic, and to express their feelings of [[self-criticism]]. They are asked to analyze this criticism and make note of its defining characteristics. Then, the user is asked to take the chair of their criticized self, and to imagine verbally responding to their inner critic. Subsequently, the user is prompted to conduct a dialogue between these two aspects of the self, the criticizer and the criticized. Following this, the user is asked to imagine themself as a compassionate observer of this dialogue, and finally the user is asked to reflect upon the experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 4: The criticizer, the criticized, and the compassionate observer|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-4-criticizer-criticized-compassionate-observer/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Changing your critical self-talk ===
This exercise is meant to be conducted over several weeks, in the form of recurring reflection on the nature of their self-criticism. Users are asked to aim to notice when they are being self-critical, to react to their self-criticism with compassion, and to reframe the language of their inner critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 5: Changing your critical self-talk|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-5-changing-critical-self-talk/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Journal ===
This exercise entails keeping a daily journal for at least one week, and is used to reflect on difficult experiences, self-criticisms, and other stressors. The user is asked to analyze each of these events through the lenses of self-kindness (using gentle, comforting language to respond to the event), mindfulness (awareness of the negative emotions elicited by the situation), and common humanity (how the experience is part of the human condition).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 6: Self-Compassion Journal|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-6-self-compassion-journal/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identifying what we really want ===
In this exercise, the user is asked to think about the ways that they use self-criticism as a way to motivate themself. Then, the user is asked to try to come up with a kinder and gentler and more caring way of motivating themself to make the desired change, and to try and be aware of how they use self-criticism as a motivational tool in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 7: Identifying what we really want|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-7-identifying-really-want/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taking care of the caregiver ===
This exercise prompts the user to engage in meaningful self-care on a regular basis, and to practice these techniques while they are actively caring for others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 8: Taking care of the caregiver|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-8-taking-care-caregiver/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-forgiveness as an element ==
Self-forgiveness is an element of self-compassion that involves releasing self-directed negative feelings. Research has found that self-forgiveness promotes greater overall well-being, specifically higher self-esteem and lower neuroticism.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Self-Forgiveness versus Excusing: The Roles of Remorse, Effort, and Acceptance of Responsibility|last = Fisher|first = Mickie|date = 2006|journal = Psychology Press|doi = 10.1080/15298860600586123|pmid = |volume=5|issue = 2|pages=127–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pro-social behavior ===
When self-directed negative feelings are a result of negative past action, self-forgiveness does not mean ignoring or excusing offenses, but rather practicing self-compassion while taking full responsibility for past action. In this way, self-forgiveness may increase people's willingness to repent for wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Despite this research, there is not yet a clear link between self-forgiveness and pro-social behavior. It would seem that accepting responsibility for negative actions leads to pro-social behavior, and coupling acceptance with self-forgiveness increases this effect.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Self-acceptance as an element ==
Self-acceptance is an element of self-compassion that involves accepting oneself for who and what they are. Self-acceptance differs from [[self-esteem]] in that self-esteem involves globally evaluating one's worth. Self-acceptance means accepting the self despite flaws, weaknesses, and negative evaluations from others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Unconditional Self-Acceptance and Psychological Health|last = Chamberlain|first = John|date = 2001|journal = Journal of Rational-Emotive &amp; Cognitive-Behavior Therapy|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[mindfulness]] and self-compassion has been around for over 2500 years, and is rooted in Eastern traditional [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] philosophy and Buddhist meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cigolla | first1 = F. | last2 = Brown | first2 = D. | year = 2011 | title = A way of being: Bringing mindfulness into individual therapy | url = | journal = Psychotherapy Research | volume = 21 | issue = 6| pages = 709–721 | doi = 10.1080/10503307.2011.613076 | pmid = 21943184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Pilot Study and Randomized Controlled Trial of the Mindful Self-Compassion Program|journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology|date = 2012-01-01|volume = 69|issue = 1|doi = 10.1002/jclp.21923|pmid = 23070875|first = Kristin D.|last = Neff|first2 = Christopher K.|last2 = Germer|pages=28–44|citeseerx = 10.1.1.362.7685}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Buddhist philosophy, mindfulness and compassion is considered to be two wings of one bird, with each concept overlapping one another but producing benefits for wellbeing.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The word Mindfulness is the English translation of the word Vipassan, which a combination of two words Vi, meaning in a special way and Passana, to observe, hence implying to observe in a special way.&lt;ref&gt;Nehra, D. K., Nehra, S., &amp; Dogra, R. (2012). Positive psychological functioning with mindfulness based stress reduction 	(MBSR) program. ''Biopsychosocial issues in positive health. Delhi: Global Vision Publishing House''. from http://globalvisionpub.com/globaljournalmanager/pdf/1389680520.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Compassion]] (karunaa) can be defined as an emotion that elicits the wanting to be free from suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Loving-kindness and compassion meditation: Potential for psychological interventions|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272735811001115|journal = Clinical Psychology Review|date = 2011-01-01|pmc = 3176989|pmid = 21840289|volume = 31|issue = 7|doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2011.07.003|first = Stefan G.|last = Hofmann|first2 = Paul|last2 = Grossman|first3 = Devon E.|last3 = Hinton|pages=1126–1132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness in the context of self-compassion comprises acknowledging one's painful experiences in a balanced way that neither ignores, or ruminates on the disliked characteristics of oneself or life. According to Neff (2012) it is essential to be mindful of one's own personal suffering in order to extend compassion towards one's self. However it is essential to pay attention to self suffering in a  grounded way in order to avoid "over-identification".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Mindfulness tends to focus on the internal experience such as sensation, emotion and thoughts rather than focusing on the experiencer. Self-compassion focuses on soothing and comforting the self when faced with distressing experiences.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Self-compassion is composed of three components; self kindness verses self-judgement, a sense of common humanity versus isolation and mindfulness versus over-identification when confronting painful thoughts and emotions.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

===Mindfulness-based stress reduction ===
[[Mindfulness-based stress reduction]] ([[Mindfulness-based stress reduction|MBSR]]), developed by [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] is a structured group program that uses [[mindfulness meditation]] to relieve suffering associated with physical, [[Psychosomatic Illness|psychosomatic]] and [[psychiatric disorders]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Teaching self-care to caregivers: Effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction on the mental health of therapists in training|journal = Training and Education in Professional Psychology|date = 2007-01-01|volume = 1|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/1931-3918.1.2.105|first = Shauna L.|last = Shapiro|first2 = Kirk Warren|last2 = Brown|first3 = Gina M.|last3 = Biegel|pages=105–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy seeks to increase the capacity for mindfulness, by reducing the need for self-focused thoughts and emotions that can lead to poor mental health.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The exercise of mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy brings together the elements of meditation and yoga, greater awareness of the unity of mind and body, as well as the ways that the unconscious thoughts, feelings, and behaviors can undermine emotional, physical, and [[spirituality|spiritual]] health.&lt;ref&gt;Mindfullivingprograms.com,.

(2005) found that health care professionals who underwent a MBSR program reported significantly increased self-compassion and reduced stress levels compared to the waitlist control group. It was also reported that the increase of self-compassion appeared to reduce stress associated with the program.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy ===
[[Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy]] (MBCT) is an intervention therapy that combines meditation practices, psycho-education and cognitive behavioral strategies to prevent the relapse or recurrence of [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Z., Williams, J., &amp; Teasdale, J. (2009). ''Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for depression'' (pp. 307-312). New York, 	NY: Guilford Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; MBCT teaches individuals how to observe their thoughts and feelings by focusing their attention on natural objects, such as breathing and bodily sensations. Individuals are taught how to achieve awareness while holding an attitude of non-judgemental acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Treatment-resistant Depressed Patients Show a Good Response to Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy|journal = FOCUS|date = 2010-01-01|issn = 1541-4094|pages = 120–126|volume = 8|issue = 1|doi = 10.1176/foc.8.1.foc120|pmid = 16797486|pmc = 2808477|first = M.a.|last = Kenny|first2 = J.m.g.|last2 = Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within MBCT, mindfulness skills are taught in order to recognize distressing thoughts and feelings, to be aware of these experiences, and utilize acceptance and self-compassion to break up associative networks that may causes a relapse. Self-compassion in response to negative thoughts and feelings is an adaptive process, which validates it as a key learning skill in MBCT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How does mindfulness-based cognitive therapy work?|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0005796710001774|journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy|date = 2010-01-01|volume = 48|issue = 11|doi = 10.1016/j.brat.2010.08.003|pmid = 20810101|first = Willem|last = Kuyken|first2 = Ed|last2 = Watkins|first3 = Emily|last3 = Holden|first4 = Kat|last4 = White|first5 = Rod S.|last5 = Taylor|first6 = Sarah|last6 = Byford|first7 = Alison|last7 = Evans|first8 = Sholto|last8 = Radford|first9 = John D.|last9 = Teasdale|pages=1105–1112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-compassion has been found to be a key mechanism in the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Kuyken et al. (2010) compared the effect of MBCT with maintenance antidepressants on relapse in depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They found that mindfulness and self-compassion were increased after MBCT was introduced. They also found that MBCT reduced the connection of cognitive reactivity and depressive relapse, and that the increased self-compassion helped mediate this association.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Mindful self-compassion therapy ===
Mindful self-compassion (MSC) therapy is a hybrid therapy consisting of self-compassion and mindfulness practices.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The term mindful is referred to in the MSC program as the basic mindfulness skills which is turning toward painful thoughts and emotions and seeing them as they are without suppression or avoidance which is crucial to the development of self-compassion.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The MSC program however focuses more on self-compassion and sees mindfulness as a secondary emphasis.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; MSC teaches both formal (meditation) and informal (daily life) self-compassion practices. In addition there are homework MSC assignments that teaches participants to be kinder to themselves.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The goal of MSC therapy is to provide participants with a variety of tools to increase self-compassion which they can then in turn integrate into their lives.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; A study conducted by Neff and Germer (2012) found that compared with the control group, MSC intervention participants reported significantly larger increases in self-compassion, mindfulness, wellbeing and a decrease in depression, stress and anxiety which were maintained for 6 months after the initial intervention.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

===Compassion focused therapy ===
Paul Gilbert (2009) developed [[compassion focused therapy]] (CFT) that teaches clients that, due to how our brains have evolved, anxiety, anger and depression are natural experiences that are occur through no fault of our own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Common language for psychotherapy procedures: the first 80|doi = 10.13140/2.1.2348.1126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Introducing compassion-focused therapy|url = http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/15/3/199|journal = Advances in Psychiatric Treatment|date = 2009-05-01|issn = 2056-4678|pages = 199–208|volume = 15|issue = 3|doi = 10.1192/apt.bp.107.005264|first = Paul|last = Gilbert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients are trained to change maladaptive thought patterns such as "I'm unlovable" and provide alternative self-statements, such as "know for sure that some people love me".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The goal of CFT is to help patients develop a sense of warmth and emotional responsiveness to oneself.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This is achieved through a variety of exercises including visualization, cultivating self-kindest through language by engaging in self-compassionate behaviors and habits.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In CFT self-compassion is utilized through thoughts, images, and attention which is needed to stimulate and develop the contentment, sooth and safeness system.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Mindfulness skills in dialectical behavior therapy ===
[[Dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT), is a derivative of [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavior therapy]] that incorporates Eastern meditative practice.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mechanisms of change in dialectical behavior therapy: Theoretical and empirical observations|journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology|date = 2006-01-01|volume = 62|issue = 4|doi = 10.1002/jclp.20243|pmid = 16470714|first = Thomas R.|last = Lynch|first2 = Alexander L.|last2 = Chapman|first3 = M. Zachary|last3 = Rosenthal|first4 = Janice R.|last4 = Kuo|first5 = Marsha M.|last5 = Linehan|pages=459–480|citeseerx = 10.1.1.472.9570}}&lt;/ref&gt; DBT is based on a dialectical world view that incorporates the balance and integration of opposing beliefs, particularly in acceptance and change. We accept ourselves as good enough, and we recognize the need for all of us to change and grow.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Unlike MBCT and MBSR therapies, dialectical behavior therapy does not use meditation but less formal exercises, such as individual therapy sessions and group skill sessions.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; In general last for approximately a year where participants will engage in weekly individual skill therapy sessions and group skill sessions.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Baer, R. (2006). ''Mindfulness-based treatment approaches''. Amsterdam: Elsevier, Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The skills therapy sessions include four segments; core [[mindfulness]], interpersonal effectiveness, [[Emotional self-regulation|emotion regulation]], and [[distress tolerance]] skills.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Dialectical behaviour therapist recommend developing self-compassion. The basic premise of using self-compassion therapies in DBT is to cultivate a compassionate mind state, defined by feelings of warmth, safety, presence and interconnectedness that can in turn relieve [[emotional dysregulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Does Self-Compassion Mitigate the Association Between Childhood Maltreatment and Later Emotion Regulation Difficulties?

===Mindfulness and related skills in acceptance and commitment therapy ===
[[Acceptance and commitment therapy]] utilizes behavior change process, mindfulness and acceptance process. ACT, involves non-judgmental awareness and openness to cognitive sensation an emotional experiences.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; It also promotes exposure to previously avoided situations that have caused anxiety in order to promote acceptance. The avoidant behavior is treated by having clients observing their thoughts and accepting that their thoughts are not necessarily harmful.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; In general ACT strategies are customized to fit each participant so they obtain psycho-education, [[problem solving]] skills and [[psychological flexibility]]. Mindfulness and acceptance exercises skills facilitates the behavioral changes necessary for its user to pursue a life that they feel is vital and meaningful.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Various sources have indicated that acceptance and commitment therapy overlaps with Neff's conceptualization of self compassion particularly the ACT's relational frame theory. The basic theories and concepts underlining ACT, may be relevant and have shown to be parallels and hold similarities found in self-compassion&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Using acceptance and commitment therapy to increase self-compassion: A randomized controlled trial|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2212144714000763|journal = Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science|date = 2014-01-01|pmc = 4260406|pmid = 25506545|volume = 3|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/j.jcbs.2014.09.002|first = James E.|last = Yadavaia|first2 = Steven C.|last2 = Hayes|first3 = Roger|last3 = Vilardaga|pages=248–257}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first is ACT perspective and Neff's concept of self-kindness are both linked to self-acceptance. Acceptance of one's painful experiences and hurt is related to kindness to one's self.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Second Neff's conceptualization of self-compassion and ACT both emphasize mindfulness, which is practiced ACT through the concepts of defusion, acceptance, contact with the present moment and the self as a context. Defusion is also used in self-compassion as a means of allowing self-criticisms to pass through the mind with believing, proving them wrong or engaging stance to make these thoughts workable.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; In a study conducted by Yadavaia, Hayes &amp; Vilardaga, 2014 test the efficacy of an ACT approach to self-compassion as compared to a waitlist control, the study showed that ACT interventions led to a large increase in self-compassion and psychopathology compared to the waitlist control at post-treatment and two months post intervention.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-stereotyping occurs when an individual integrates commonly held characterizations (i.e. [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States|stereotypes]] or [[prototype]]s) of an [[Ingroups and outgroups|in-group]] into his or her [[self-concept]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal

According to SIT, group membership is most likely to influence self-concept and [[self-esteem]] when the cognitive processes of  [[Identification (psychology)|identification]] and [[categorization]] interact. In other words, when an individual identifies strongly with a group and categorizes him or herself as a member of that group, group membership becomes integrated into the person’s [[Identity (social science)|identity]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Self-stereotyping has been described as a form of [[Self-categorization theory#Depersonalization|depersonalization]] in which the self is viewed as a categorically interchangeable member of a salient ingroup.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."&gt;{{cite book |last=Haslam |first=S. A. |authorlink=Alex Haslam |date=2001 |title=Psychology in Organizations |location=London |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-0-7619-6157-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of one’s social identity can directly relate to a decline in one's personal identity since conforming to group goals influences an individual's beliefs and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Whitley-Kite-2010"&gt;Whitley,  B. E. Jr., Kite, M.E. (2010). The social context of prejudice. The psychology of prejudice and discrimination, Ed. 2, (p. 333). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-stereotyping has also been characterized as an ''overlap'' between how a person represents their ingroup and how they represent the self.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Members of low-status groups have been found to be more prone to self-stereotyping than members of high-status groups. Research suggests that members of low-status groups attribute ingroup characteristics to the self via a  ''deduction-to-the-self'' process. That is, they accept stereotypical characteristics (both positive and negative) of their ingroup as reflective of themselves. In contrast, it has been suggested that members of high-status groups tend to ''project'' their personal characteristics onto their ingroup using an ''induction-to-the-ingroup'' cognitive strategy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Research examining gender-based self-stereotyping has characterized female ingroups as low status and male ingroups as high status. This is because in modern society gender inequality still exists.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women have been show to self-stereotype more than men. Furthermore, implicit gender self-categorization has been identified as a key mechanism underlying the tendency of women to self-stereotype.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Some researchers have found that self-stereotyping is somewhat dependent upon an individual’s belief that he/she and the group are capable of change.&lt;ref name="Hong-2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hong | first1 = Y.-J. Y.-Y. | year = 2010 | title = Implicit Theories of the world and Implicit Theories of the Self as Moderators of Self-Stereotyping | doi = 10.1521/soco.2010.28.2.251 | journal = Social Cognition | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 251–261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the individual believes that the groups needs are different from their own, they may have to adapt his/her self-representation in order to maintain membership within the in-group. However, if other in-group members are flexible to change, an individual is more likely to maintain his/her [[self-image]] and avoid self-stereotyping. Individuals tend to adapt to group characteristics more readily if they see this change as an enhancement to the self. Therefore, the individual's perception of the group influences how much he or she is willing to sacrifice in order to be a member.&lt;ref name="Hong-2010" /&gt;

In a press release by the United Nations Iraq on August 12, 2014, representatives report “atrocious accounts on the abduction and detention of Yazidi, Christian, as well as Turkomen and Shabak women, girls and boys, and reports of savage rapes, are reaching us in an alarming manner.”&lt;ref name="uniraq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniraq.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=2373:srsg-bangura-and-srsg-mladenov-gravely-concerned-by-reports-of-sexual-violence-against-internally-displaced-persons&amp;Itemid=605&amp;lang=en|title=SRSG Bangura and SRSG Mladenov gravely concerned by reports of sexual violence against internally displaced persons|publisher=Uniraq.org|accessdate=23 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924045204/http://www.uniraq.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=2373:srsg-bangura-and-srsg-mladenov-gravely-concerned-by-reports-of-sexual-violence-against-internally-displaced-persons&amp;Itemid=605&amp;lang=en|archive-date=2014-09-24|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instances of sexual violence appear to be increasing, with some estimates totaling 1,500 Yazidi and Christian captives forced into sexual slavery.&lt;ref name="uniraq" /&gt;
 
[[Amnesty International]] infers that ISIL has “launched a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing in northern Iraq,” where “many of those held by IS have been threatened with rape or sexual assault or pressured to convert to Islam.  In some cases entire families have been abducted”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/gruesome-evidence-ethnic-cleansing-northern-iraq-islamic-state-moves-wipe-out-minorities-2014-0|title=Gruesome evidence of ethnic cleansing in northern Iraq as Islamic State moves to wipe out minorities - Amnesty International|date=2 September 2014|publisher=Amnesty.org|accessdate=23 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027184421/http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/gruesome-evidence-ethnic-cleansing-northern-iraq-islamic-state-moves-wipe-out-minorities-2014-0|archive-date=2014-10-27|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, these crimes extend beyond gender-based violence as males, in addition to females, are being targeted.  In this case sexual violence is employed to achieve a political goal,  religious conversion to Islam as interpreted by ISIL.

Yazidi girls in Iraq allegedly [[War rape|raped]] by ISIL fighters have committed [[suicide]] by jumping to their death from [[Mount Sinjar]], as described in a witness statement.&lt;ref name=rudaw-26082014&gt;{{cite news|last=Ahmed|first=Havidar|title=The Yezidi Exodus, Girls Raped by ISIS Jump to their Death on Mount Shingal|date=14 August 2014|url=http://rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/140820142|publisher=[[Rudaw Media Network]]|accessdate=26 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819125450/http://rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/140820142|archive-date=2014-08-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haleh Esfandiari from the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] has highlighted the abuse of local women by ISIL militants after they have captured an area. "They usually take the older women to a makeshift slave market and try to sell them. The younger girls ... are raped or married off to fighters", she said, adding, "It's based on temporary marriages, and once these fighters have had sex with these young girls, they just pass them on to other fighters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brekke|first1=Kira|title=ISIS Is Attacking Women, And Nobody Is Talking About It|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/08/isis-attacks-on-women_n_5775106.html?cps=gravity|accessdate=11 September 2014|work=The Huffington Post|date=8 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912003756/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/08/isis-attacks-on-women_n_5775106.html?cps=gravity|archive-date=2014-09-12|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Speaking of [[Yazidi]] women captured by ISIS, [[Nazand Begikhani]] said "[t]hese women have been treated like cattle...

'''Subjective idealism''', or '''empirical idealism''', is the [[Monism|monistic]] metaphysical doctrine that only minds and mental contents exist. It [[logical consequence|entails]] and is generally identified or associated with [[wikt:immaterialism|immaterialism]], the doctrine that material things do not exist. Subjective idealism rejects [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]], [[neutral monism]], and [[materialism]]; indeed, it is the contrary of [[eliminative materialism]], the doctrine that all or some classes of [[mind|mental]] [[phenomena]] (such as emotions, beliefs, or desires) do not exist, but are sheer [[illusion]]s.

==Overview==
Subjective idealism is a fusion of [[phenomenalism]] or empiricism, which confers special status upon the immediately perceived, with [[idealism]], which confers special status upon the mental. Idealism denies the knowability or existence of the non-mental, while phenomenalism serves to restrict the mental to the empirical. Subjective idealism thus identifies its mental reality with the world of ordinary experience, rather than appealing to the unitary world-spirit of [[pantheism]] or [[absolute idealism]]. This form of idealism is "subjective" not because it denies that there is an objective reality, but because it asserts that this reality is completely dependent upon the minds of the subjects that perceive it.

The earliest thinkers identifiable as subjective idealists were certain members of the [[Yogācāra]] school of Indian Buddhism, who reduced the world of experience to a stream of subjective perceptions. Subjective idealism made its mark in Europe in the 18th-century writings of [[George Berkeley]], who argued that the idea of mind-independent reality is incoherent, concluding that the world consists of the minds of humans and of God. Subsequent writers have continuously grappled with Berkeley's [[skepticism|skeptical]] arguments. [[Immanuel Kant]] responded by rejecting Berkeley's immaterialism and replacing it with [[transcendental idealism]], which views the mind-independent world as existent but incognizable [[noumenon|in itself]]. Since Kant, true immaterialism has remained a rarity, but is survived by partly overlapping movements such as phenomenalism, subjectivism, and [[perspectivism]].

==History==
Thinkers such as [[Plato]], [[Plotinus]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] anticipated idealism's antimaterialism with their views of the inferior or derivative reality of matter. However, these [[Platonism|Platonists]] did not make Berkeley's turn toward subjectivity. Indeed, Plato rationalistically condemned sense-experience, whereas subjective idealism presupposed [[empiricism]] and the irreducible reality of [[sense data]]. A more subjectivist methodology could be found in the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonists']] emphasis on the world of appearance, but their skepticism precluded the drawing of any [[ontology|ontological]] conclusions from the epistemic primacy of phenomena.

The first mature articulations of idealism arise in [[Yogacara|Yogacarin]] thinkers such as the 7th-century epistemologist [[Dharmakirti|Dharmakīrti]], who identified ultimate reality with sense-perception. The most famous proponent of subjective idealism in the Western world was the 18th-century [[Ireland|Irish]] philosopher [[George Berkeley]], although Berkeley's term for his theory was ''immaterialism''. From the point of view of subjective idealism, the material world does not exist, and the phenomenal world is dependent on humans. Hence the fundamental idea of this philosophical system (as represented by Berkeley or [[Ernst Mach|Mach]]) is that things are complexes of ideas or sensations, and only subjects and objects of perceptions exist. Berkeley summarized his theory with the motto "''esse est percipi''" ("To be is to be perceived"), but went on to elaborate it with God as the source of [[consensus reality]] and other particulars.

According to Berkeley, an object has real being as long as it is perceived by a mind. God, being omniscient perceives everything perceivable, thus all real beings exist in the mind of God. However, it is also evident that each of us has free will and understanding upon self-reflection, and our senses and ideas suggest that other people also possess these qualities as well. According to Berkeley there is no material universe, in fact he has absolutely no idea what that could possibly mean. To theorize about a universe that is composed of insensible matter is not a sensible thing to do. This matters because there is absolutely no positive account for a material universe, only speculation about things that are by fiat outside of our minds.

Berkeley's assessment of immaterialism was criticized by [[Samuel Johnson]], as recorded by [[James Boswell]].  Responding to the theory, Dr. Johnson exclaimed "I refute it ''thus''!" while kicking a rock with "mighty force".  This episode is alluded to by Stephen Dedalus in James Joyce's ''Ulysses'', chapter three. Reflecting on the "ineluctable modality of the visible", Dedalus conjures the image of Johnson's refutation and carries it forth in conjunction with Aristotle's expositions on the nature of the senses as described in ''[[Sense and Sensibilia (Aristotle)|Sense and Sensibilia]]''.  Aristotle held that while visual perception suffered a compromised authenticity because it passed through the diaphanous liquid of the inner eye before being observed, sound and the experience of hearing were not thus similarly diluted. Dedalus experiments with the concept in the development of his aesthetic ideal.

==In fiction==
{{see also|Solipsism}}

Subjective idealism is featured prominently in the Norwegian novel ''[[Sophie's World]]'', in which "Sophie's world" exists in fact only in the pages of a book.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;!-- needs reliable source that what is presented in that book is actually subjective idealism --&gt;

A parable of subjective idealism can be found in [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' short story ''[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]'', which specifically mentions Berkeley.

In [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological classification]], the term '''subspecies''' refers to a unity of populations of a [[species]] living in a subdivision of the species' global range and varies  from other populations of the same species by [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mayr, E. |year=1982 |title=Of what use are subspecies? |journal=The Auk |issue=99 (3) |pages=593−595}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Monroe, B. L. |year=1982 |title=A modern concept of the subspecies |journal=The Auk |issue=99 (3) |pages=608−609}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A subspecies cannot be recognized independently. A species is either recognized as having no subspecies at all or at least two, including any that are extinct. The term is abbreviated '''subsp.''' in [[botany]] and [[bacteriology]], or '''ssp.''' in [[zoology]]. The [[plural]] is the same as the singular: ''subspecies''.

In [[zoology]], under the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]], the subspecies is the only taxonomic rank below that of species that can receive a name. In [[botany]] and [[mycology]], under the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]], other [[infraspecific name|infraspecific ranks]], such as [[variety (botany)|variety]], may be named. In [[bacteriology]] and [[virology]], under standard [[International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes|bacterial nomenclature]] and [[virus classification|virus nomenclature]], there are recommendations but not strict requirements for recognizing other important infraspecific ranks.

A taxonomist decides whether to recognize a subspecies or not. A common criterion for a subspecies is its ability of [[interbreeding]] with a different subspecies of the same species and producing fertile offspring. In the wild, subspecies do not interbreed due to their [[Allopatric speciation|geographic isolation]] and [[sexual selection]]. The differences between subspecies are usually less distinct than the differences between species.

==Nomenclature==
In [[zoology]], the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' (4th edition, 1999) accepts only one rank below that of species, namely the rank of subspecies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp "Index"]. ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]''. Fourth Edition. [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]. January 1, 2000. Retrieved January 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Other groupings, "[[infrasubspecific]] entities" do not have names regulated by the ''ICZN''. Such forms have no official ''ICZN'' status, though they may be useful in describing altitudinal or geographical [[Cline (biology)|clines]], [[pet]] [[breed]]s, [[Transgenic animals#Transgenic animals|transgenic animals]], etc. While the scientific name of a species is a [[Binomial nomenclature|binomen]], the scientific name of a subspecies is a [[trinomen]] - a binomen followed by a subspecific name. A [[tiger]]'s binomen is ''Panthera tigris'', so for a [[Sumatran tiger]] the trinomen is, for example, ''Panthera tigris sumatrae''.  ''Subspecies'' is generally abbreviated as "ssp." in zoology, but is not used in scientific name.

In [[botany]], subspecies is one of many ranks below that of species, such as [[Variety (botany)|variety]], [[subvariety]], [[form (botany)|form]], and subform. The subspecific name is preceded by "subsp.", as in ''Schoenoplectus californicus'' subsp. ''[[Totora (plant)|tatora]]''. A botanical name consists of at most three parts. An [[Infraspecific name (botany)|infraspecific name]] includes the species binomial, and one infraspecific epithet, such as subspecies or variety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Mallet |title=Subspecies, semispecies, superspecies |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Sp/Sub-semi.pdf |website=ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Microbiology|bacteriology]], the only rank below species that is regulated explicitly by the code of nomenclature is ''subspecies'', but infrasubspecific taxa are extremely important in bacteriology; Appendix 10 of the code lays out some recommendations that are intended to encourage uniformity in describing such taxa. Names published before 1992 in the rank of ''variety'' are taken to be names of subspecies&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=icnb&amp;part=A185 "Chapter 3: Rules of Nomenclature with Recommendations"]. [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]]. Retrieved January 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; (see ''[[International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes]]'').  As in botany, ''subspecies'' is conventionally abbreviated as "subsp.", and is used in the scientific name: ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' subsp. ''spizizenii''.&lt;ref name="ICNP 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |at="Names of Subspecies: Rule 13a"&lt;!--This document is not page-numbered.--&gt; |title=International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (2008 Revision) |date=20 November 2015 |orig-year=2008 |journal=International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology |edition=ICSP Matters |volume=|issue=&lt;!--Appears to have been a special stand-alone issue; no vol./issue numbers specified.--&gt; |first1=Charles T. |last1=Parker |first2=Brian J. |last2=Tindall |first3=George M. |last3=Garrity |doi=10.1099/ijsem.0.000778|pmid=26596770 }} Full text available from PDF link at this page; direct URL to PDF is auto-generated and expires.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nominotypical subspecies, and subspecies autonyms===
{{anchor|Nominate subspecies|Autonymous subspecies|Nominotypical subspecies and subspecies autonyms|reason=previous section names, and term anchors}}
In [[zoological nomenclature]], when a species is split into subspecies, the originally described population is retained as the "nominotypical subspecies"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?nfv=true&amp;article=47 International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Art. 47]&lt;/ref&gt; or "nominate subspecies", which repeats the same name as the species. For example, ''Motacilla alba alba'' (often abbreviated ''M. a. alba'') is the nominotypical subspecies of the [[white wagtail]] (''Motacilla alba'').

The subspecies name that repeats the species name is referred to in [[botanical nomenclature]] as the subspecies "[[Autonym (botany)|autonym]]", and the subspecific taxon as the "autonymous subspecies".&lt;ref name=ICN&gt;{{cite book |last1=McNeill |first1=J. |last2=Barrie |first2=F. R. |last3=Buck |first3=W. R. |last4=Demoulin |first4=V. |last5=Greuter |first5=W. |last6=Hawksworth |first6=D. L. |last7=Herendeen |first7=P.

===Doubtful cases===
When zoologists disagree over whether a certain population is a subspecies or a full species, the species name may be written in parentheses. Thus ''Larus (argentatus) smithsonianus'' means the [[American herring gull]]; the notation within the parentheses means that some consider it a subspecies of a larger [[European herring gull|herring gull]] species and therefore call it ''Larus argentatus smithsonianus'', while others consider it a full species and therefore call it ''Larus smithsonianus'' (and the user of the notation is not taking a position).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Criteria==
A subspecies is a taxonomic rank below species – the only recognized rank in the zoological code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature |title=ICZN Glossary |publisher=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |editor1-first=Gary |editor1-last=Rosenberg |display-editors=etal |url= http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?booksection=glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of three main ranks below species in the botanical code.&lt;ref name=ICN/&gt; When geographically separate populations of a species exhibit recognizable [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] differences, biologists may identify these as separate subspecies; a subspecies is a recognized local variant of a species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Peter J. |last1=Russell |first2=Paul E. |last2=Hertz |first3=Beverly |last3=McMillan |title=Biology: The Dynamic Science |publisher=Brooks/Cole California |date=2011 |chapter=21: Speciation |page=456 |isbn=978-1133418849 |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jSw9AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA456}}&lt;/ref&gt; Botanists and mycologists have the choice of ranks lower than subspecies, such as variety (varietas) or form (forma), to recognize smaller differences between populations.&lt;ref name=ICN/&gt;

==Monotypic and polytypic species==
[[File:One horned Rhino.jpg|thumb|The [[Indian rhinoceros]] (''Rhinoceros unicornis'') is a [[monotypic]] species]]
In biological terms, rather than in relation to nomenclature, a ''[[Polytypic taxon|polytypic]]'' species has two or more genetically and phenotypically divergent subspecies, [[Race (biology)|races]], or more generally speaking, [[population]]s that need a separate description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mayr, E. |author-link=Mayr, Ernst |title=Populations, Species, and Evolution: An Abridgment of Animal Species and Evolution |year=1970 |publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are separate groups that are clearly distinct from one another and do not generally interbreed, although there may be a relatively narrow hybridization zone, but which may interbreed if given the chance to do so. These subspecies, races, or populations, can be named as subspecies by zoologists, or in more varied ways by botanists and microbiologists.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

A ''[[Monotypic taxon|monotypic]]'' species has no distinct population or races, or rather one race comprising the whole species. A taxonomist would not name a subspecies within such a species. Monotypic species can occur in several ways:
* All members of the species are very similar and cannot be sensibly divided into biologically significant subcategories.
* The individuals vary considerably, but the variation is essentially random and largely meaningless so far as genetic transmission of these variations is concerned.
* The variation among individuals is noticeable and follows a pattern, but there are no clear dividing lines among separate groups: they fade imperceptibly into one another. Such [[Cline (biology)|clinal]] variation always indicates substantial [[gene flow]] among the apparently separate groups that make up the population(s). Populations that have a steady, substantial gene flow among them are likely to represent a monotypic species, even when a fair degree of genetic variation is obvious.

In [[philosophy]], '''supervenience''' refers to a relation between sets of properties or sets of facts. X is said to supervene on Y if and only if some difference in Y is necessary for any difference in X to be possible. Equivalently, X is said to supervene on Y if and only if X cannot vary unless Y varies. Here are some examples. 

* Whether there is a table in the living room supervenes on the positions of molecules in the living room.
* The truth value of (A) supervenes on the truth value of (¬A). 
* Molecular properties supervene on atomic properties. 
* The quality of Nixon’s moral character supervenes on how he is disposed to act.

A table could not be removed from a room without the positions of molecules in that room changing. In a logic with double negation elimination, the truth value of (A) could not change without the truth value of (¬A) changing. Facts about the properties of a molecule could not change without facts about its atomic constituents changing. And facts about the quality of Nixon's moral character could not change without facts about how he has acted, or about how he would be disposed to act, changing. 

Supervenience is of interest to philosophers because it differs from other nearby relations, for example [[Logical_consequence|entailment]]. It may be possible for some A to supervene on some B without being entailed by B. In such cases it may seem puzzling why A should supervene on B and equivalently why changes in A should require changes in B. Two important applications of supervenience involve cases like this. One of these is the supervenience of mental properties (like the sensation of pain) on physical properties (like the firing of ‘pain neurons’). A second is the supervenience of normative facts (facts about how things ought to be) on natural facts (facts about how things are).

These applications are elaborated below. But an illustrative note bears adding here. It is sometimes claimed (and has been claimed in earlier versions of this entry) that what is at issue in these problems is the supervenience claim itself. For example, it has been claimed that what is at issue with respect to the mind-body problem is whether mental phenomena do in fact supervene on physical phenomena. This is incorrect. It is by and large agreed that some form of supervenience holds in these cases: Pain happens when the appropriate neurons fire. The disagreement is over why this is so. Materialists claim that we observe supervenience because the neural phenomena entail the mental phenomena, while dualists deny this. The dualist’s challenge is to explain supervenience without entailment. 

The problem is similar with respect to the supervenience of normative facts on natural facts. It is agreed that facts about how persons ought to act are not entailed by natural facts but cannot vary unless natural facts vary, and this rigid binding without entailment might seem puzzling. The possibility of "supervenience without entailment" or "supervenience without reduction" is contested territory among philosophers.

== History ==

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:DavidsonDonald.jpg|thumb|right|[[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] popularized the use of supervenience in the philosophy of mind.]] --&gt;

Supervenience, which means literally "coming or occurring as something novel, additional, or unexpected",&lt;ref name="Horgan"&gt;Horgan, Terry (1993) "From supervenience to superdupervenience: meeting the demands of a material world."  ''Mind.''  '''102''': 555-86.&lt;/ref&gt; from "super," meaning on, above, or additional, and "venire," meaning to come, shows occurrences in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] dating back to 1844.

Its systematic use in philosophy is considered to have begun in early 20th-century [[meta-ethics]] and [[emergentism]]. As [[G.E. Moore]] wrote in 1922, "if a given thing possesses any kind of intrinsic value in a certain degree, then... anything ''exactly like it'', must, under all circumstances, possess it in exactly the same degree".&lt;ref name="Horgan"/&gt; This usage also carried over into the work of [[R. M. Hare]]. For discussion of the emergentist roots of supervenience see [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/supervenience/#2.2 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Supervenience].

In the 1970s, [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] was the first to use the term to describe a broadly physicalist (and non-reductive) approach to the philosophy of mind.  As he said in 1970, "supervenience might be taken to mean that there cannot be two events alike in all physical respects but differing in some mental respects, or that an object cannot alter in some mental respects without altering in some physical respects." &lt;ref name = "Davidson"&gt;Davidson, Donald (1970) "Mental Events." Reprinted in ''Essays on Actions and Events''. Oxford: Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent years Terry Horgan, [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], and especially [[Jaegwon Kim]] formalized the concept and began applying it to many issues in the philosophy of mind. This raised numerous questions about how various formulations relate to one another, how adequate the formulation is to various philosophical tasks (in particular, the task of formulating [[physicalism]]), and whether it avoids or entails [[reductionism]].

== Definitions ==

In the contemporary literature, there are two primary (and non-equivalent) formulations of supervenience (for both definitions let A and B be sets of properties).{{Citation needed|reason=It refers to the literature but there is no single reference in this section |date=January 2018}}

(1) A-properties supervene on B-properties if and only if all things that are B-indiscernible are A-indiscernible.  Formally:
*&lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y (\forall X_{\in B} (Xx \leftrightarrow Xy) \rightarrow \forall Y_{\in A} (Yx \leftrightarrow Yy))&lt;/math&gt;
(2) A-properties supervene on B-properties if and only if anything that has an A-property has some B-property such that anything that has that B-property also has that A-property. Formally:
*&lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall X_{\in A} (Xx \rightarrow \exists Y_{\in B} (Yx \and \forall y (Yy \rightarrow Xy)))&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if one lets A be a set of mental properties, lets B be a set of physical properties, and chooses a [[domain of discourse]] consisting of persons, then (1) says that any two persons who are physically indiscernible are mentally indiscernible, and (2) says that any person who has a mental property has some physical property such that any person with that physical property has that mental property.

Some points of clarification: first, the definitions above involve quantification over properties and hence [[higher order logic]].  Second, in (1), expressions of the form &lt;math&gt;(\forall X (Xx \leftrightarrow Xy))&lt;/math&gt; capture the concept of sharing all properties, or being [[indiscernible]] with respect to a set of properties.  Thus, (1) can be understood more intuitively as the claim that all objects that are indiscernible with respect to a base set of properties are indiscernible with respect to a supervenient set of properties, or, as it is also sometimes said, that B-twins are A-twins.  Finally, supervenience claims typically involve some modal force, however, the way that  [[Modal logic|modal]] force is specified depends on which more specific variety of supervenience one decides upon (see below).

(1) and (2) are sometimes called "schemata", because they do not correspond to actual supervenience relations until the sets of properties A and B, the [[domain of discourse|domain]] of entities to which those properties apply, and a modal force have been specified. For modal forms of supervenience, the modal strength of the relation is usually taken to be a parameter (that is, the possible worlds appealed to may be physically possible, logically possible, etc.). Also, note that in the early literature properties were not always central, and there remain some who prefer to frame the relation in terms of [[Predicate (logic)|predicates]], [[fact]]s, or [[entities]] instead, for example.

Beginning in the 1980s, inspired largely by [[Jaegwon Kim]]'s work, philosophers proposed many varieties of supervenience, which [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] called the "unlovely proliferation".&lt;ref name = "Lewis"&gt;Lewis, David (1986) ''[[On the Plurality of Worlds]]''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These varieties are based both on (1) and (2) above, but because (1) is more common we shall focus on varieties of supervenience based on it.

We can begin by distinguishing between local and global supervenience:

* Local: For any two objects x and y, if x and y are base-indiscernible, they are supervenient-indiscernible.

For example, if mental states locally supervene on brain states, then being in the same brain state entails being in the same mental state.

* Global: For any two worlds w1 and w2, if w1 and w2 are base-indiscernible, they are supervenient-indiscernible.

For example, if psychological properties globally supervene on physical properties, then any two worlds physically the same will be psychologically the same.  The value of global supervenience is that it allows for supervenient properties to be determined not by local properties of an individual thing alone, but by some wider spatiotemporal distribution of things and properties. For example, something's being a dollar bill depends not only on the paper and the inks it is made out of, but also on a widely dispersed variety of features of the world it occupies.

Both local and global supervenience come in many forms. Local supervenience comes in strong and weak varieties:

* Weak: For any world w, and for any two objects x in w and y in w, if x and y are base-indiscernible, they are supervenient-indiscernible.
* Strong: For any worlds w1 and w2, and for any two objects x in w1 and y in w2, if x and y are base-indiscernible, they are supervenient-indiscernible.

The difference is essentially whether correlations between base and supervenient properties hold within actual worlds only, or across possible worlds. For example, if psychological properties strongly locally supervene on physical properties, then any two people physically the same, in any two worlds, will also be psychologically the same. On the other hand, if psychological properties only weakly locally supervene on physical properties, then those correlations between base and supervenient properties that hold in virtue of the supervenience relation are maintained within each world, but can be different in different worlds. For example, my physical duplicates in the actual world will have the same thoughts as I have; but my physical duplicates in other possible worlds may have different thoughts than I have in the actual world.

There are also several kinds of global supervenience relations, which were introduced to handle cases in which worlds are the same at the base level and also at the supervenient level, but where the ways the properties are connected and distributed in the worlds differ.  For example, it is consistent with global mental–physical supervenience on the simple formulation described above for two worlds to have the same number of people in the same physical states, but for the mental states to be distributed over those people in different ways (e.g. I have my father's thoughts in the other world, and he has my thoughts).  To handle this, property-preserving isomorphisms (1-1 and onto functions between the objects of two worlds, whereby an object in one world has a property if and only if the object which that function takes you to in the other world does) are used, and once this is done, several varieties of global supervenience can be defined.

Other varieties of supervenience include multiple-domains supervenience and similarity-based supervenience.

==Examples of supervenient properties==

===Value properties===
The [[Value theory|value]] of a physical object to an [[wiktionary:agent|agent]] is sometimes held to be supervenient upon the physical properties of the object.  In [[aesthetics]], the [[beauty]] of [[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte|La Grande Jatte]] might supervene on the physical composition of the painting (the specific [[molecules]] that make up the painting), the artistic composition of the painting (in this case, [[Pointillism|dots]]), the figures and forms of the painted image, or the painted canvas as a whole.  In [[ethics]], the [[good and evil|goodness]] of an act of [[charity (virtue)|charity]] might supervene on the physical properties of the agent, the mental state of the agent (his or her intention), or the external [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] itself.  Similarly, the overall suffering caused by an earthquake might supervene on the spatio-temporal entities that constituted it, the deaths it caused, or the natural disaster itself. The claim that moral properties are supervenient upon non-moral properties is called [[moral supervenience]].

===Mental properties===
In [[philosophy of mind]], many philosophers make the general claim that the mental supervenes on the physical. In its most recent form this position derives from the work of [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], although in more rudimentary forms it had been advanced earlier by others. The claim can be taken in several senses, perhaps most simply in the sense that the mental ''properties'' of a person are supervenient on their physical ''properties''. Then:

* If two persons are indistinguishable in all of their physical properties, they must also be indistinguishable in all of their mental properties.

An alternative claim, advanced especially by [[John Haugeland]], is a kind of ''weak local'' supervenience claim; or, weaker still, mere ''global'' supervenience. The claim that mental properties supervene globally on physical properties requires only a quite modest commitment: any difference between two possible worlds with respect to their instantiated mental properties entails at least ''some'' difference in the physical properties instantiated in those two worlds.  Importantly, it does ''not'' require that the mental properties of an individual person supervene ''only'' on that person's physical state.

This weak global thesis is particularly important in the light of [[direct reference]] theories, and [[semantic externalism]] with regard to the content both of words and (more relevant to our concerns here) of ''thoughts''.  Imagine two persons who are indistinguishable in their local physical properties. One has a dog in front of his eyes and the other has a dog-image artificially projected onto his retinae. It might be reasonable to say that the former is in the ''mental state'' of seeing a dog (and of knowing that he does so), whereas the latter is not in such a state of seeing a dog (but falsely believes that he sees one).

There is also discussion among philosophers about mental supervenience and our experience of duration. If all mental properties supervene only upon some physical properties at durationless moments, then it may be difficult to explain our experience of duration. The philosophical belief that mental and physical events exist as a series of durationless moments that lie between the physical past and the physical future is known as [[Presentism (philosophy of time)|presentism]], and is a form of belief in [[Galilean relativity]].

===Computational properties===
There are several examples of supervenience to be found in [[computer network]]ing. For example, in a dial-up internet connection, the audio signal on a phone line transports [[Internet Protocol|IP packets]] between the user's computer and the [[Internet service provider]]'s computer. In this case, the arrangement of bytes in that packet supervenes on the physical properties of the phone signal. More generally, each layer of the [[OSI Model]] of computer networking supervenes on the layers below it.

We can find supervenience wherever a message is conveyed by a representational medium. When we see a letter "a" in a page of print, for example, the meaning ''Latin lowercase "a"'' supervenes on the geometry of the boundary of the printed [[glyph]], which in turn supervenes on the ink deposition on the paper.

===Biological properties===
In biological systems [[phenotype]] can be said to supervene on [[genotype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Mitchell, Valone| first=W.A., T.J. | year=1990 | title=The Optimization Research Program: Studying Adaptations by Their Function | journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume=65 | pages=43–52| doi=10.1086/416584 | issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because any genotype encodes a finite set of unique phenotypes, but any given phenotype is not produced by a finite set of genotypes. Innumerable examples of [[convergent evolution]] can be used to support this claim. Throughout nature, convergent evolution produces incredibly similar phenotypes from a diverse set of taxa with fundamentally different genotypes underpinning the phenotypes. One example is [[Foster's rule|evolution on islands]] which is a remarkably predictable example of convergent evolution where the same phenotypes consistently evolve for the same reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Foster | first=J.B. | year=1964 | title=The evolution of mammals on islands | journal=Nature | volume=202 | pages=234–235| doi=10.1038/202234a0 | bibcode=1964Natur.202..234F | issue=4929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisms released from predation tend to become larger, while organisms limited by food tend to become smaller. Yet there are almost infinite numbers of genetic changes that might lead to changes in body size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fisher | first=R.A. | year=1918 | title=The correlation between relatives on the supposition of Mendelian inheritance | journal=Soc Edinb. | volume=52 | pages=399–433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kemper | first=K.E. | last2=Visscher | first2=P.M. | last3=Gooddard | first3=M.E. | year=2012 | title=Genetic architecture of body size in mammals | journal=Genome Biol. | volume=13 | pages=244| doi=10.1186/gb-2012-13-4-244 | issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of convergent evolution is the loss of sight that almost universally occurs in [[cave fish]] living in lightless pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gatenby R.A., Gillies R.J  |author2=Brown J.S.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2011 | title= Of cancer and cave fish  | journal= Nature Reviews Cancer | volume=11 | pages=237| doi=10.1038/nrc3036 | issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eyes are expensive, and in lightless cave pools there is little reason for fish to have eyes. Yet, despite the remarkably consistent convergent evolution producing sightless cave fish, the genetics that produce the loss of type phenotype is different nearly every time. This is because phenotype supervenes on genotype.

==Arguments against supervenience-based formulations of physicalism==
Although supervenience seems to be perfectly suited to explain the predictions of physicalism (i.e. the mental is dependent on the physical), there are four main problems with it. They are ''Epiphenomenal ectoplasm'', the ''lone ammonium molecule problem'', ''modal status problem'' and the ''problem of necessary beings.''

=== Epiphenomenal ectoplasm ===

''Epiphenomenal ectoplasm'' was proposed by Horgan and Lewis in 1983, in which they stated, a possible world (a world that could possibly exist) ''W'' is identical to our world in the distribution of all mental and physical characteristics (i.e. they are identical), except world ''W'' contains an experience called ''epiphenomenal ectoplasm'' that does not causally interact with that world. If supervenience physicalism is true, then such a world could not exist because a physical duplicate of the actual world (the world that is known to exist) could not possess an ''epiphenomenal ectoplasm''. This was rectified by [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]], by adjusting the application of supervenience within physicalism to state "Physicalism is true at a possible world ''W'' if and only if any world which is a minimal physical duplicate (i.e. identical) of ''W'' is a duplicate of ''W simpliciter.''"{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

=== The lone ammonium molecule problem ===

The ''lone ammonium molecule problem'' provides a problem for Jackson's solution to ''epiphenomenal ectoplasm''. It was proposed by [[Jaegwon Kim]] in 1993 when he stated that according to Jackson's idea of supervenience, a possible world ''W'' was identical to the actual world, except it possessed an extra ammonium molecule on one of Saturn's rings. This may not seem to provide much of a problem, but because Jackson's solution refers only to minimal physical duplicates, this allows for the mental properties of ''W'' to be vastly different from those in the actual world. If such a difference would cause mental differences on Earth, it would not be consistent with our understanding of physicalism.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

=== Modal status problem ===

The ''modal status problem'' is only problematic if one thinks of physicalism as a [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] truth (i.e. not [[logical truth|necessary truth]]), because it is described in terms of modal notions (i.e. through modal realism). The problem is presented when, from the statement "Minimal physical truths entail all truths," one derives the statement "''S'' (a statement that describes all minimal physical truths) entails ''S''* (a statement that describes the world)". This statement is a necessary truth, and therefore supervenience physicalism could not be contingent. The solution to this is to accept the above statement not as the equivalent of physicalism, but as an entailment of it.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

=== Problem of necessary beings ===

The ''problem of necessary beings'' was proposed by Jackson in 1998, in which he stated that a necessary being exists in all possible worlds as a [[non-physical entity]], and therefore proves physicalism false. However, physicalism allows for the existence of necessary beings, because any minimal physical duplicate would have the same mental properties as the actual world. This however is [[paradox]]ical, based on the fact that physicalism both permits and prevents the existence of such beings. This violates [[Hume's fork]] which states, "there are no necessary connections between distinct existences".{{cn|date=January 2018}}

[[File:Tameshigiri.jpg|thumb|''Tameshigiri'' using a ''goza'' target on a stand (2006)]]
'''''Tameshigiri''''' (試し斬り, 試し切り, 試斬, 試切) is the Japanese art of target '''test cutting'''.  The [[kanji]] literally mean "[[:wiktionary:試|test]] [[:wiktionary:切|cut]]" ([[kun'yomi]]: ためし ぎり ''tameshi giri''). This practice was popularized in the [[Edo period]] (17th century) for testing the quality of [[Japanese sword]]s.&lt;ref name="Kapp1987-41"&gt;Kapp (1987), p.41&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to the present day, but has evolved into a martial art which focuses on demonstrating the practitioner's skill with a sword.

== Origins ==
[[File:Ikidou.JPG|thumb|''Tameshigiri'' on a convicted criminal]]
During the [[Edo]] period, only the most skilled swordsmen were chosen to test swords, so that the swordsman's skill was not a variable in determining how well the sword cut. The materials used to test swords varied greatly. Some substances were ''wara'' (rice straw), ''goza'' (the top layer of [[tatami]] mats), [[bamboo]], and thin steel sheets.

In addition, there were a wide variety of cuts used on [[cadaver]]s and occasionally convicted criminals,&lt;ref name="Sesko2011"&gt;Sesko (2011), p.148&lt;/ref&gt; from ''tabi-gata'' (ankle cut) to ''O-kesa'' (diagonal cut from shoulder to opposite hip). The names of the types of cuts on cadavers show exactly where on the body the cut was made. Older swords can still be found today that have inscriptions on their ''nakago'' ([[tang (tools)|tang]]) that say things such as, "5 bodies with ''Ryu Guruma'' (hip cut)". Such an inscription, known as a ''tameshi-mei'' or ''saidan-mei'' (cutting signature) would add greatly to a sword's value,&lt;ref name="Man2011" /&gt; compensating the owner somewhat for the large sums of money typically charged for the test.&lt;ref&gt;Sesko (2011), p.149&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from specific cuts made on cadavers, there were the normal cuts of Japanese swordsmanship, i.e. downward diagonal (''Kesa-giri''), upward diagonal (''Kiri-age'' or ''Gyaku-kesa''), horizontal (''Yoko'' or ''Tsuihei''), and straight downward (''Jodan-giri'', ''Happonme'', ''Makko-giri'', ''Shinchoku-giri'' or ''Dottan-giri'').

There is an apocryphal story of a condemned criminal who, after being told he was to be executed by a sword tester using a ''Kesa-giri'' cut, calmly joked that if he had known that was going to happen, he would have swallowed large stones to damage the blade.&lt;ref name="Man2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Man|first=John|title=Samurai|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRdqWcmZcH4C&amp;pg=PA55|date=10 February 2011|publisher=Transworld|isbn=978-1-4090-1105-7|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==
[[File:Tameshigiri-pattern-tsubamegaeshi.png|thumb|upright=0.6|Diagram of the ''Tsubamegaeshi''  cutting pattern on a ''goza'' target]]
In modern times, the practice of ''tameshigiri'' has come to focus on testing the swordsman's abilities, rather than the sword's. Indeed, the swords used are typically inexpensive ones.&lt;ref name="Kapp1987-42"&gt;Kapp (1987), p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners of ''tameshigiri'' sometimes use the terms ''Shito'' (試刀, sword testing) and ''Shizan'' (試斬, test cutting, an alternate pronunciation of the characters for ''tameshigiri'') to distinguish between the historical practice of testing swords and the contemporary practice of testing one's cutting ability. The target most often used is the [[tatami]] "omote" rush mat. To be able to cut consecutive times on one target, or to cut multiple targets while moving, requires that one be a very skilled swordsman.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Targets today are typically made from ''goza'', or rolled [[tatami]] omote, the top layer of the traditional Japanese floor covering, either bundled or rolled into a cylindrical shape. They may be soaked in water to add density to the material. This density is to approximate that of flesh. Green bamboo is used to approximate bone.

Once the ''goza'' target is in this cylindrical shape, it has a vertical grain pattern when stood vertically on a target stand, or horizontally when placed on a horizontal target stand (''dotton'' or ''dodan''). This direction of the grain affects the difficulty of the cut.

The difficulty of cuts is a combination of the target material hardness, the direction of the grain of the target (if any), the quality of the sword, the angle of the blade (''hasuji'') on impact, and the angle of the swing of the sword (''tachisuji'').

When cutting a straw target that is standing vertically, the easiest cut is the downward diagonal. This is due to a combination of the angle of impact of the cut against the grain (approximately 30-50 degrees from the surface), the downward diagonal angle of the swing, and the ability to use many of the major muscle groups and rotation of the body to aid in the cut.

Next in difficulty is the upward diagonal cut which has the same angle, but works against gravity and uses slightly different muscles and rotation. The third in difficulty is the straight downward cut, not in terms of the grain but in terms of the group of muscles involved. The most difficult cut of these four basic cuts is the horizontal direction (against a vertical target) which is directly perpendicular to the grain of the target.

There are a number of swordsmen who have recently set records in the field of ''tameshigiri''. Mitsuhiro Saruta, founder of Ryuseiken, set the initial [[Guinness World Record]] for completing 1000 cuts (senbongiri) in 1 hour 36 minutes on September 20, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eonet.ne.jp/~ryuseiken/english/main.htm ''International Batto-do Shizan Association'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=January 2013}} In 2000, Russell McCartney of ''Ishiyama-ryū'' completed 1181 consecutive cuts without a missed attempt in 1 hour 25 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brad|last=Wong |title=Seattle samurai marksman holds world record |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Seattle-samurai-marksman-holds-world-record-1242980.php |location = Seattle |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=6 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Saruta and McCartney performed ''senbongiri'' using a ''kata''-based approach as one of the criteria for their challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Russell|last=McCartney |title=Senbongiri |url=http://ishiyamaryu.net/resources/articles/senbongiri.htm |location = Seattle, WA |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isao Machii]] of Shūshinryū currently has the record for the fastest ''senbongiri'' performance of 36 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/11000/fastest-1000-martial-arts-sword-cuts ''Guinness World Records Website'': Fastest Time to Complete 1,000 Cuts]&lt;/ref&gt; Machii also holds records for the most cuts in three minutes (252), and the most cuts to a single free-standing target (7).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-10000/most-sword-cuts-to-straw-mats-in-three-minutes/ ''Guinness World Records Website'': Most Cuts In 3 Minutes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-12000/most-martial-arts-sword-cuts-to-one-mat-(suegiri)/ ''Guinness World Records Website'': Most Cuts to One Mat]&lt;/ref&gt; The record for most cuts in one minute (83) is held by ''[[Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu]]'' practitioner Iaso Machii of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-9000/most-martial-arts-sword-cuts-in-one-minute// ''Guinness World Records Website'': Most Cuts In One Minute]&lt;/ref&gt; Toshishiro Obata holds the record for ''Kabuto Wari'', or helmet cutting, for his cut on a steel ''Kabuto'' (helmet).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shinkendo.com/kabuto.html ''Kabuto Wari'' Record]&lt;/ref&gt; Obata also holds the ''Ioriken Battojutsu'' speed cutting record for 10 cuts on 10 targets over three rounds.  His times are 6.4, 6.4, and 6.7 seconds respectively. Brandt Noel of San Yama Ryu Bujutsu holds the record of 19 mats with ''Katana'' using ''Kesa-giri''.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

[[Historical European Martial Arts]] reconstructors, under the term "test cutting", engage in similar exercises with various [[European sword]]s. While tatami ''omote'', green bamboo (though rarely), and especially meat are the preferred cutting targets, other substances are commonly used due to being cheaper, and much easier to obtain: [[pool noodle]]s, various gourds (pumpkins, squash, etc.), water-filled plastic bottles, soaked newspaper rolls, synthetic targets or wet clay.

==Target configurations==
[[File:Tameshigiri-pattern-yokonarabi.png|thumb|upright=0.6|Diagram of the ''Kihon toho'' ''tameshigiri'' cutting pattern performed on three targets]]
The targets can be placed in different configurations:
# Most frequently, there is a single stand on which a single target is placed vertically.
# A second configuration involves multiple targets in place vertically on a long stand (a ''yoko-narabi'').
# A third configuration involves multiple targets placed horizontally on a different type of stand called a ''dodan'' or ''dotton''.
# A fourth configuration involves single (#1) or multiple targets (#2), each on separate stands.
# A fifth configuration(particular to rolled ''goza'') involves multiple targets rolled together to create a thicker and denser target. This can be used in the previous configurations (#1, #2, #3)

The '''[[tensor product]] of [[quadratic form]]s''' is most easily understood when one views the quadratic forms as ''[[quadratic space]]s''. If ''R'' is a commutative ring where ''2'' is invertible, and if &lt;math&gt;(V_1, q_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(V_2,q_2)&lt;/math&gt; are two quadratic spaces over ''R'', then their tensor product &lt;math&gt;(V_1 \otimes V_2, q_1 \otimes q_2)&lt;/math&gt; is the quadratic space whose underlying ''R''-module is the [[Tensor product of modules|tensor product]] &lt;math&gt;V_1 \otimes V_2&lt;/math&gt; of ''R''-modules and whose quadratic form is the quadratic form associated to the tensor product of the bilinear forms associated to &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;.

In particular, the form &lt;math&gt;q_1 \otimes q_2&lt;/math&gt; satisfies

:&lt;math&gt; (q_1\otimes q_2)(v_1 \otimes v_2) = q_1(v_1) q_2(v_2) \quad \forall v_1 \in V_1,\ v_2 \in V_2&lt;/math&gt;

(which does uniquely characterize it however). It follow from this that if we have diagonalizations of our quadratic forms (which is always possible if &lt;math&gt;2 \in R&lt;/math&gt; is invertible) such that 

:&lt;math&gt;q_1 \cong \langle a_1, ... , a_n \rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;q_2 \cong \langle b_1, ... , b_m \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

then the tensor product has diagonalization

:&lt;math&gt;q_1 \otimes q_2 \cong \langle a_1b_1, a_1b_2, ... a_1b_m, a_2b_1, ... , a_2b_m , ... , a_nb_1, ... a_nb_m \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

A '''tradition''' is a [[belief]] or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past.&lt;ref name="Green1997"&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas A. Green |title=Folklore: an encyclopedia of beliefs, customs, tales, music, and art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S7Wfhws3dFAC&amp;pg=PA800 |access-date=5 February 2011 |year=1997|publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-87436-986-1|pages=800–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shils2006-12"/&gt; Common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like [[court dress|lawyers' wig]]s or military officers' [[spur]]s), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings. Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of years—the word ''tradition'' itself derives from the [[Latin]] ''tradere'' literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways.  

The phrase "according to tradition", or "by tradition", usually means that whatever information follows is known only by oral tradition, but is not supported (and perhaps may be refuted) by physical documentation, by a physical artifact, or other quality evidence. ''Tradition'' is used to indicate the quality of a piece of information being discussed. For example, "According to tradition, Homer was born on Chios, but many other locales have historically claimed him as theirs." This tradition may never be proven or disproven. In another example, "[[King Arthur]], by tradition a true British king, has inspired many well loved stories."  Whether they are documented fact or not does not decrease their value as cultural history and literature. 

Traditions are a subject of study in several academic fields, especially in [[social sciences]] such as anthropology, [[archaeology]], and biology.

The concept of tradition, as the notion of holding on to a previous time, is also found in political and philosophical discourse. For example, it is the basis of the political concept of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalism]], and also strands of many world religions including [[traditional Catholicism]]. In artistic contexts, tradition is used to decide the correct display of an art form. For example, in the performance of traditional genres (such as traditional dance), adherence to guidelines dictating how an art form should be composed are given greater importance than the performer's own preferences. A number of factors can exacerbate the [[loss of tradition]], including industrialization, [[globalization]], and the assimilation or [[marginalization]] of specific cultural groups. In response to this, tradition-preservation attempts have now been started in many countries around the world, focusing on aspects such as traditional languages. Tradition is usually contrasted with the goal of [[modernity]] and should be differentiated from customs, conventions, laws, norms, routines, rules and similar concepts.

==Definition==
[[File:LeningradCodex text.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Leningrad Codex|Textual traditions]] of bound manuscripts of the [[Sefer Torah]] (Torah scroll) are passed down providing additional [[niqqud|vowel points]], [[dagesh|pronunciation marks]] and [[cantillation|stress accents]] in the authentic [[Masoretic Text]] of the [[Jewish Bible]], often the basis for translations of the Christian Old Testament]]
The English word ''tradition'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''traditio'', the noun from the verb ''tradere'' (to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping); it was originally used in [[Roman law]] to refer to the concept of legal transfers and [[inheritance]].&lt;ref name="Giddens2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Giddens|title=Runaway world: how globalization is reshaping our lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPMtVIsNo-wC&amp;pg=PA39|accessdate=5 February 2011|year=2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-94487-8|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Congar2004"/&gt; According to [[Anthony Giddens]] and others, the modern meaning of tradition evolved during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period, in opposition to modernity and [[progress (history)|progress]].&lt;ref name="Giddens2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shils2006-3"&gt;Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&amp;pg=PA3 3–6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shils2006"&gt;Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&amp;pg=PA3 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many other generic terms, there are many definitions of tradition.&lt;ref name="Green1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shils2006-12"&gt;Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&amp;pg=PA12 12]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Congar2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yves Congar|title=The meaning of tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBDnQg5zw8oC&amp;pg=PA9|accessdate=5 February 2011|date=October 2004|publisher=Ignatius Press|isbn=978-1-58617-021-9|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyer1990-7"/&gt; The concept includes a number of interrelated ideas; the unifying one is that tradition refers to beliefs, objects or customs performed or believed in the past, originating in it, transmitted through time by being taught by one generation to the next, and are performed or believed in the present.&lt;ref name="Green1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shils2006-12"/&gt;

Tradition can also refer to beliefs or customs that are [[prehistory|Prehistoric]], with lost or [[arcane]] origins, existing from ''[[time immemorial]]''.&lt;ref name="Shils2006-15"&gt;Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&amp;pg=PA15 15]&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, traditions were passed orally, without the need for a [[writing system]]. Tools to aid this process include [[figures of speech|poetic devices]] such as [[rhyme]] and [[alliteration]]. The stories thus preserved are also referred to as tradition, or as part of an [[oral tradition]]. Even such traditions, however, are presumed to have originated (been "invented" by humans) at some point.&lt;ref name="Shils2006-12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Giddens2003"/&gt; Traditions are often presumed to be [[ancient]], unalterable, and deeply important, though they may sometimes be much less "natural" than is presumed.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-2-3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-3-4"/&gt; It is presumed that at least two transmissions over three [[generation]]s are required for a practice, belief or object to be seen as traditional.&lt;ref name="Shils2006-15"/&gt; Some traditions were deliberately invented for one reason or another, often to highlight or enhance the importance of a certain institution.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-1"&gt;Hobsbawm [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;pg=PA1 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditions may also be adapted to suit the needs of the day, and the changes can become accepted as a part of the ancient tradition.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-2-3"&gt;Hobsbawm [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;pg=PA2 2–3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; Tradition changes slowly, with changes from one generation to the next being seen as significant.&lt;ref name="Shils2006-14"&gt;Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&amp;pg=PA14 14]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, those carrying out the traditions will not be consciously aware of the change, and even if a tradition undergoes major changes over many generations, it will be seen as unchanged.&lt;ref name="Shils2006-14"/&gt;

There are various origins and fields of tradition; they can refer to:
# the forms of artistic heritage of a particular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lilburn | first = Douglas | title = A Search for Tradition | publisher = Alexander Turnbull Library Endowment Trust, assisted by the New Zealand Composers Foundation | location = Wellington | year = 1984 | isbn = 0-908702-00-0 |authorlink= Douglas Lilburn}} {{Page needed|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many objects, beliefs and customs can be traditional.&lt;ref name="Shils2006-12"/&gt; Rituals of [[social interaction]] can be traditional, with phrases and gestures such as saying "thank you", sending [[birth announcement]]s, [[greeting card]]s, etc.&lt;ref name="Shils2006-12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyer1990-8"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pascal Boyer|title=Tradition as truth and communication: a cognitive description of traditional discourse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7cu0joBSM8C&amp;pg=PR8|accessdate=5 February 2011|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-37417-0|pages=8–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Handler and Innekin"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Handler|first=Richard|author2=Jocelyn Innekin |title=Tradition, Genuine or Spurious|journal=Journal of American Folklore|year=1984|volume=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition can also refer to larger concepts practiced by groups (family traditions at Christmas&lt;ref name="Handler and Innekin"/&gt;), organizations (company's [[picnic]]) or societies, such as the practice of national and public holidays.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-2-3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-3-4"/&gt; Some of the oldest traditions include [[monotheism]] (three millennia) and [[citizenship]] (two millennia).&lt;ref name="Shils2006-16"&gt;Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&amp;pg=PA16 16]&lt;/ref&gt; It can also include material objects, such as buildings, works of art or tools.&lt;ref name="Shils2006-12"/&gt;

Tradition is often used as an [[adjective]], in contexts such as [[traditional music]], [[traditional medicine]], [[traditional values]] and others.&lt;ref name="Green1997"/&gt; In such constructions tradition refers to specific values and materials particular to the discussed context, passed through generations.&lt;ref name="Giddens2003-39"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Giddens|title=Runaway world: how globalization is reshaping our lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPMtVIsNo-wC&amp;pg=PA39|accessdate=5 February 2011|year=2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-94487-8|pages=39–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invention of tradition==
{{main article|Invented tradition}}
The term "[[invention of tradition]]", introduced by [[E. J. Hobsbawm]], refers to situations when a new practice or object is introduced in a manner that implies a connection with the past that is not necessarily present.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-1-2"&gt;Hobsbawm [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;pg=PA1 1–2]&lt;/ref&gt;  A tradition may be deliberately created and promulgated for personal, commercial, political, or [[National interest|national self-interest]], as was done in colonial Africa; or it may be adopted rapidly based on a single highly publicized event, rather than developing and spreading organically in a population, as in the case of the white [[wedding dress]], which only became popular after [[Queen Victoria]] wore a white gown at her wedding to [[Albert of Saxe-Coburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingraham|first=Chrys|title=White Weddings: Romancing Heterosexuality in Popular Culture|year=2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-95194-4|pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an invention of tradition is the rebuilding of the [[Palace of Westminster]] (location of the [[British Parliament]]) in the [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Gothic style]].&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-1-2"/&gt; Similarly, most of the traditions associated with [[monarchy of the United Kingdom]], seen as rooted deep in history, actually date to 19th century.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; Other examples include the invention of tradition in Africa and other colonial holdings by the occupying forces.&lt;ref name=invention&gt;[[Terence Ranger]], ''The Invention of Tradition in Colonial Africa'', in {{cite book|author1=E. J. (Eric J.) Hobsbawm| author1-link = E. J. Hobsbawm|author2=T. O. (Terence O.) Ranger| author2-link = Terrence Ranger |title=The Invention of tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA211|accessdate=4 February 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43773-8|pages=211–263|date=31 July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Requiring [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]], the [[colonial power]] would often invent a "tradition" which they could use to legitimize their own position. For example, a certain succession to a chiefdom might be recognized by a colonial power as traditional in order to favour their own candidates for the job. Often these inventions were based in some form of tradition, but were exaggerated, distorted, or biased toward a particular interpretation.

Invented traditions are a central component of modern national cultures, providing a commonality of experience and promoting the unified national identity espoused by [[nationalism]].&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-7"&gt;Hobsbawm [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;pg=PA7 7]&lt;/ref&gt; Common examples include public holidays (particularly those unique to a particular nation), the singing of national anthems, and traditional national cuisine (see [[national dish]]). [[Expatriate]] and immigrant communities may continue to practice the national traditions of their home nation.

==In scholarly discourse==
In science, tradition is often used in the literature in order to define the relationship of an author's thoughts to that of his or her field.&lt;ref name = Kurz129&gt;Kurz-Milke and Martignon 129&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, philosopher of science Karl Popper suggested that there should be a "rational theory of tradition" applied to science which was fundamentally sociological. For Popper, each scientist who embarks on a certain research trend inherits the tradition of the scientists before them as he or she inherits their studies and any conclusions that superseded it.&lt;ref name = Kurz129/&gt; Unlike [[myth]], which is a means of explaining the natural world through means other than logical criticism, scientific tradition was inherited from Socrates, who proposed critical discussion, according to Popper.&lt;ref name = Kurz129-130&gt;Kurz-Milke and Martignon 129–130&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Thomas Kuhn]], who presented his thoughts in a paper presented in 1977, a sense of such a critical inheritance of tradition is, historically, what sets apart the best scientists who change their fields is an embracement of tradition.&lt;ref name = Kurz129-130/&gt;

Traditions are a subject of study in several academic fields in [[social sciences]]—chiefly anthropology, [[archaeology]], and biology—with somewhat different meanings in different fields. It is also used in varying contexts in other fields, such as history, [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]. Social scientists and others have worked to refine the commonsense concept of tradition to make it into a useful concept for scholarly analysis. In the 1970s and 1980s, [[Edward Shils]] explored the concept in detail.&lt;ref name="Handler and Innekin"/&gt; Since then, a wide variety of social scientists have criticized traditional ideas about tradition; meanwhile, "tradition" has come into usage in biology as applied to nonhuman animals.

Tradition as a concept variously defined in different disciplines should not be confused with various traditions (perspectives, approaches) in those disciplines.&lt;ref name="Patel2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sujata Patel|title=The ISA Handbook of Diverse Sociological Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yWZGj7WghCEC&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=5 February 2011|date=October 2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-84787-402-3|pages=5–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthropology===
Tradition is one of the key concepts in anthropology; it can be said that anthropology is the study of "tradition in traditional societies".&lt;ref name="Boyer1990-7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pascal Boyer|title=Tradition as truth and communication: a cognitive description of traditional discourse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7cu0joBSM8C&amp;pg=PR7|accessdate=5 February 2011|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-37417-0|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is however no "theory of tradition", as for most anthropologists the need to discuss what tradition is seems unnecessary, as defining tradition is both unnecessary (everyone can be expected to know what it is) and unimportant (as small differences in definition would be just technical).&lt;ref name="Boyer1990-7"/&gt; There are however dissenting views; scholars such as [[Pascal Boyer]] argue that defining tradition and developing theories about it are important to the discipline.&lt;ref name="Boyer1990-7"/&gt;

===Archaeology===
In [[archaeology]], the term ''tradition'' is a set of [[archaeological culture|cultures]] or [[archaeological industry|industries]] which appear to develop on from one another over a period of time. The term is especially common in the study of [[American archaeology]].&lt;ref name="Handler and Innekin" /&gt;

===Biology===
Biologists, when examining groups of non-humans, have observed repeated behaviors which are taught within communities from one generation to the next. Tradition is defined in biology as "a behavioral practice that is relatively enduring (i.e., is performed repeatedly over a period of time), that is shared among two or more members of a group, that depends in part on socially aided learning for its generation in new practitioners", and has been called a precursor to "culture" in the anthropological sense.&lt;ref name = Fragaszy2&gt;Fragaszy and Perry 2, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral traditions have been observed in groups of fish, birds, and mammals. Groups of orangutans and chimpanzees, in particular, may display large numbers of behavioral traditions, and in chimpanzees, transfer of traditional behavior from one group to another (not just within a group) has been observed. Such behavioral traditions may have evolutionary significance, allowing adaptation at a faster rate than genetic change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}
In the field of [[musicology]] and [[ethnomusicology]] tradition refers to the belief systems, repertoire, techniques, style and culture that is passed down through subsequent generations. Tradition in music suggests a historical context with which one can perceive distinguishable patterns. Along with a sense of history, traditions have a fluidity that cause them to evolve and adapt over time.
While both musicology and ethnomusicology are defined by being 'the scholarly study of music'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duckles|first=Vincent|title=Musicology.|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/46710pg1|work=Grove Music Online.

===Sociology===
The concept of tradition, in early sociological research (around the turn of the 19th and 20th century), referred to that of the [[traditional society]], as contrasted by the more modern [[industrial society]].&lt;ref name=slang&gt;S. Langlois, Traditions: Social, In: Neil J. Smelser and Paul B. Baltes, Editor(s)-in-Chief, ''International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences'', Pergamon, Oxford, 2001, Pages 15829-15833, {{ISBN|978-0-08-043076-8}}, {{doi|10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/02028-3}}. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B7MRM-4MT09VJ-4PM/2/1eb81ee3e63af98afa7a48ecacfb64a6 Online]&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was most notably portrayed in [[Max Weber]]'s concepts of [[traditional authority]] and modern [[rational-legal authority]].&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; In more modern works, One hundred years later, sociology sees tradition as a [[social construct]] used to contrast past with the present and as a form of [[rationality]] used to justify certain course of action.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt;

Traditional society is characterized by lack of distinction between family and business, [[division of labor]] influenced primarily by age, gender, and status, high position of custom in the system of values, self-sufficiency, preference to saving and accumulation of capital instead of productive investment, relative [[autarky]].&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; Early theories positing the simple, [[unilineal evolution]] of societies from traditional to industrial model are now seen as too simplistic.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt;

In 1981 Edward Shils in his book ''Tradition'' put forward a definition of tradition that became universally accepted.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; According to Shils, tradition is anything which is transmitted or handed down from the past to the present.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt;

Another important sociological aspect of tradition is the one that relates to rationality. It is also related to the works of Max Weber (see [[Rationality#Theories of rationality|theories of rationality]]), and were popularized and redefined in 1992 by [[Raymond Boudon]] in his book ''Action''.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; In this context tradition refers to the mode of thinking and action justified as "it has always been that way".&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; This line of reasoning forms the basis of the logical flaw of the [[appeal to tradition]] (or ''argumentum ad antiquitatem''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Texas University |title=Is-Ought fallacy |url=http://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/fallacies/isought.htm |work=Fallacies Definitions |publisher=Texas State University Department of Philosophy |accessdate=2008-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826004350/http://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/fallacies/isought.htm |archivedate=26 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which takes the form "this is right because we've always done it this way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases such an appeal can be refuted on the grounds that the "tradition" being advocated may no longer be desirable, or, indeed, may never have been despite its previous popularity.

===Philosophy===
The idea of tradition is important in philosophy. Twentieth century philosophy is often divided between an 'analytic' tradition, dominant in Anglophone and Scandinavian countries, and a 'continental' tradition, dominant in German and Romance speaking Europe. Increasingly central to continental philosophy is the project of deconstructing what its proponents, following [[Martin Heidegger]], call 'the tradition', which began with [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. In contrast, some continental philosophers - most notably, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] - have attempted to rehabilitate the tradition of [[Aristotelianism]]. This move has been replicated within analytic philosophy by [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]. However, MacIntyre has himself deconstructed the idea of 'the tradition', instead posing [[Aristotelianism]] as one philosophical tradition in rivalry with others.

==In political and religious discourse==
[[File:Wigilia potrawy 76.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Holiday celebrations may be passed down as traditions, as is the case with this distinctly Polish Christmas meal, decor with [[Christmas tree#Poland|Christmas tree]], a tradition since the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century]]
{{main article|Traditional values|Traditionalist conservatism}}
The concepts of tradition and traditional values are frequently used in political and religious discourse to establish the legitimacy of a particular set of values. In the United States in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the concept of tradition has been used to argue for the centrality and legitimacy of conservative religious values.&lt;ref name="Bronner"/&gt; Similarly, strands of orthodox theological thought from a number of world religions openly identify themselves as wanting a return to tradition. For example, the term "[[traditionalist Catholic]]" refers to those, such as [[Marcel Lefebvre|Archbishop Lefebvre]], who want the worship and practices of the church to be as they were before the [[Second Vatican Council]] of 1962–65.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marty|first=Martin E.|title=Fundamentalisms observed|year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-50878-8|page=92|author2=R. Scott Appleby }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] are referred to as ''Ahlus Sunnah wa Al-Jamā‘ah'' ({{lang-ar|أهل السنة والجماعة}}), literally "people of the tradition [of [[Muhammad]]] and the community", emphasizing their attachment to religious and cultural tradition.

More generally, tradition has been used as a way of determining the [[political spectrum]], with [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] parties having a stronger affinity to the ways of the past than [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] ones.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Here, the concept of adherence tradition is embodied by the political philosophy of traditionalist conservatism (or simply ''traditionalism''), which emphasizes the need for the principles of [[natural law]] and transcendent moral order, [[hierarchy]] and [[organic unity]], [[agrarianism]], [[classicism]] and [[high culture]], and the intersecting spheres of loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson, ed. (2006) ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia'' Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, pp. 870–875.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionalists would therefore reject the notions of [[individualism]], liberalism, modernity, and [[social progress]], but promote cultural and educational renewal,&lt;ref&gt;Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson, ed. (2006) ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia'' Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, p. 870.&lt;/ref&gt; and revive interest in the church, the family, the state and local community. This view has been criticised for including in its notion of tradition practices which are no longer considered to be desirable, for example, stereotypical views of the [[Feminism|place of women in domestic affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Sex Roles|volume=7|issue=2|pages=183–188|doi=10.1007/BF00287804|title=Feminists and traditionalists: An attitudinal comparison|author=M. Dwayne Smith|author2=George D. Self |year=1981|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r8122k666286p664/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other societies, especially ones experiencing rapid social change, the idea of what is "traditional" may be widely contested, with different groups striving to establish their own values as the legitimate traditional ones. Defining and enacting traditions in some cases can be a means of building unity between subgroups in a diverse society; in other cases, tradition is a means of [[othering]] and keeping groups distinct from one another.&lt;ref name="Bronner"/&gt;

==In artistic discourse==
In artistic contexts, in the performance of traditional genres (such as [[traditional dance]]), adherence to traditional guidelines is of greater importance than performer's preferences.&lt;ref name="Green1997"/&gt; It is often the unchanging form of certain arts that leads to their perception as traditional.&lt;ref name="Green1997"/&gt; For artistic endeavors, tradition has been used as a contrast to ''[[creativity]]'', with traditional and [[folk art]] associated with unoriginal imitation or repetition, in contrast to [[fine art]], which is valued for being original and unique. More recent philosophy of art, however, considers interaction with tradition as integral to the development of new artistic expression.&lt;ref name="Bronner"/&gt;

==Relationship to other concepts==
In the social sciences, ''tradition'' is often contrasted with ''modernity'', particularly in terms of whole societies. This dichotomy is generally associated with a linear model of social change, in which societies progress from being traditional to being modern.&lt;ref name="Gusfield"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition-oriented societies have been characterized as valuing [[filial piety]], harmony and group welfare, stability, and [[interdependence]], while a society exhibiting modernity would value "individualism (with free will and choice), mobility, and progress."&lt;ref name="Bronner"&gt;Bronner, Simon J. "Tradition" in ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences''. Ed. William A. Darity, Jr.. Vol. 8. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2008. p420-422.&lt;/ref&gt; Another author discussing tradition in relationship to modernity, Anthony Giddens, sees tradition as something bound to ritual, where ritual guarantees the continuation of tradition.&lt;ref name = Giddens&gt;Giddens, "Living in a Post-Traditional Society" 64&lt;/ref&gt; Gusfield and others, though, criticize this dichotomy as oversimplified, arguing that tradition is dynamic, heterogeneous, and coexists successfully with modernity even within individuals.&lt;ref name="Gusfield"/&gt;

Tradition should be differentiated from ''customs, [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], laws, [[Norm (sociology)|norms]], routines, rules'' and similar concepts. Whereas tradition is supposed to be invariable, they are seen as more flexible and subject to innovation and change.&lt;ref name="Green1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-2-3"/&gt; Whereas justification for tradition is [[ideology|ideological]], the justification for other similar concepts is more practical or technical.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-3-4"&gt;Hobsbawm [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;pg=PA3 3–4]&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, customs, routines, conventions, rules and such can evolve into traditions, but that usually requires that they stop having (primarily) a practical purpose.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-3-4"/&gt; For example, wigs worn by lawyers were at first common and fashionable; [[spur]]s worn by military officials were at first practical but now are both impractical and traditional.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-3-4"/&gt;

==Preservation==
[[File:GOOD SHABBES -.jpg|thumb|Woman welcoming the [[Shabbat#Welcoming Sabbath|Shabbat]], a more than 3300 year old tradition.]]

In many countries, concerted attempts are being made to preserve traditions that are at risk of being lost. A number of factors can exacerbate the loss of tradition, including industrialization, [[globalization]], and the [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] or [[marginalization]] of specific cultural groups.&lt;ref name="UVic"&gt;{{cite book|last=McIntosh|first=Tracey|title=New Zealand identities: departures and destinations |year=2005 |publisher=Victoria University Press |location=Wellington, N.Z.|isbn=0-86473-517-0|editor=James H. Liu|page=40|chapter=Maori Identities: Fixed, Fluid, Forced}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customary celebrations and lifestyles are among the traditions that are sought to be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presstv.ir/detail/162937.html |title=PressTV&amp;nbsp;– Iran plans to preserve Nowruz traditions |work=presstv.ir |date=31 January 2011 |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/03/11/bahrain.pearling.industry/index.html |title=Bahrain seeks to preserve ancient pearling traditions |publisher=CNN |date=11 March 2010 |accessdate=5 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the concept of tradition has been used to defend the preservation and reintroduction of minority languages such as [[Cornish language|Cornish]] under the auspices of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/6554120/Cornish-street-signs-to-be-translated.html|accessdate=6 February 2010|title=Cornish street signs to be translated|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |author=Richard Savill|date=12 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the charter holds that these languages "contribute to the maintenance and development of Europe's cultural wealth and traditions". The Charter goes on to call for "the use or adoption... of traditional and correct forms of place-names in regional or minority languages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/148.htm|title=European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages|date=5 November 1992|accessdate=6 February 2010|publisher=[[Council of Europe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[UNESCO]] includes both "oral tradition" and "traditional manifestations" in its definition of a country's cultural properties and heritage. It therefore works to preserve tradition in countries such as Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/en/brasilia/culture-in-brazil/world-heritage-in-brazil/|title=World Heritage in Brazil |publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], certain artworks, structures, craft techniques and performing arts are considered by the Japanese government to be a precious legacy of the Japanese people, and are protected under the Japanese Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties.&lt;ref name="ACA"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.bunka.go.jp/bunkazai/pamphlet/pdf/pamphlet_en_03.pdf| title =Cultural Properties for Future Generations| date =June 2007| work =Administration of Cultural Affairs in Japan ― Fiscal 2009| publisher =[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]]| format =PDF| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090327083232/http://www.bunka.go.jp/bunkazai/pamphlet/pdf/pamphlet_en_03.pdf| archivedate =27 March 2009| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law also identifies people skilled at traditional arts as "[[Living National Treasure (Japan)|National Living Treasures]]", and encourages the preservation of their craft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.sfgate.com/1999-05-30/books/17688560_1_living-treasures-art-works-authors |title=Treasures of Japan&amp;nbsp;– Its Living Artists|work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=30 May 1999 |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For native peoples like the [[Māori people|Māori]] in New Zealand, there is conflict between the fluid identity assumed as part of modern society and the traditional identity with the obligations that accompany it; the loss of language heightens the feeling of isolation and damages the ability to perpetuate tradition.&lt;ref name="UVic"/&gt;

==Traditional cultural expressions==

The phrase "traditional cultural expressions" is used by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] to refer to "any form of artistic and literary expression in which traditional culture and knowledge are embodied. They are transmitted from one generation to the next, and include handmade textiles, paintings, stories, legends, ceremonies, music, songs, rhythms and dance."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|title=ENGAGING - A Guide to Interacting Respectfully and Reciprocally with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, and their Arts Practices and Intellectual Property|author=[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] et al|publisher=Australian Government: Indigenous Culture Support|year=2015|p=7|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330114112/http://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|archivedate=30 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jainism}}
In [[Jain Philosophy|Jain tradition]], '''twelve contemplations''', ([[Prakrit]]: बारस अणुवेक्खा ) are the twelve mental reflections that a [[Jain monasticism|Jain ascetic]] and a [[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|practitioner]] should repeatedly engage into. These twelve contemplations are also known as ''Barah anuprekśa'' or ''Barah bhāvana''. According to [[Jain Philosophy]], these twelve contemplations pertain to eternal truths like nature of universe, human existence, and [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] on which one must meditate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|2001|pp=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve contemplations is an important topic that has been developed at all epochs of [[Jain literature]]. They are regarded as summarising fundamental teachings of the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Caillat|2008|pp=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stoppage of new Karma is called ''[[Samvara]]''. Constant engagement on these twelve contemplations help the soul in ''samvara'' or stoppage of karmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Umasvati|2006|pp=223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prabhacandra|2012|pp=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Twelve Contemplations ==
Following are twelve Anupreksas or bhavanas that one must constantly reflect or contemplate upon:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|2001|pp=248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sangave|2001|pp=237–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ol start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Anitya'' – Impermanence (of everything), that is, contemplation on the fact that everything in this world including relations are transient and fleeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Asharana'' – Helplessness (against our karma). The soul is helpless against its own karma.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Ekatva'' – Solitariness (of the soul), that is, acceptance of the fact that I am alone in the world and alone will suffer or enjoy the consequences of my Karma.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Anyatva'' Distinctiveness (of the self from everything else). The knowledge that the world, my kinsmen, my body, my mind, all are distinct from my real self i.e. the soul.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''[[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|Samsara]]'' – (inevitability of) transmigration, reflection of the fact that soul is ensnared in the continuous and sorrowful cycle of birth and death and cannot attain true happiness till it ends this cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''[[Loka]]'' – (the nature of) Universe, that is, contemplation on the fundamental truths about the universe that it is beginningless, uncreated and operates according to its own laws—there is no divine omnipotent being responsible for the Universe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Ashucitva'' – Impurity (of soul, on account of its association with karma) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''[[Asrava]]'' – Influx of karma. Reflection of the fact that inflow of karmas is the cause of my mundane existence and there is no liberation as long as my soul is associated with karmas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''[[Samvara]]'' – Cessation of karmic inflow, that is, contemplation on the stoppage of karmic inflow by cultivating necessary virtues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''[[Nirjara]]'' – Shedding of karma, that is, shedding or destruction of karmas by penances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Dharmasvakhyata'' – path of righteousness, Reflection on the true nature of the path to righteousness based on true teachings of Jina through various practices like Ahimsa and non-attachment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Bodhidurlabha''  – Rarity of finding the right path to enlightenment. Reflection on the fact that true enlightenment is very rare and many souls are deprived of moksha or liberation due to failure to reincarnate as human and attain true teachings of the Jina.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

== Importance of Twelve Contemplations ==
Twelve Contemplations or ''anupreksa'' is an important tool for meditation. In Yogasastra, Hemcandra gives great importance to the twelve contemplations since constant reflections on these ''bhavanas'' results in detachment in worldly matters which in turn results in equanimity. With equanimity, passions (kasaya) are eliminated resulting in mental purity. This finally culminates into knowledge of self.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hemacandra|2012|pp=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, these twelve contemplations are also one of the reasons for stoppage of influx of karmas as they regulate our thoughts and physical actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Umasvati|2006|pp=223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Important texts detailing twelve contemplations ==
*Barasa Anuvekkha, a 2nd Century CE text by Acarya [[Kundakunda]]. It is a short Prakrit text of 90 gathas focusing on the spiritual aspects of meditation. Kundakunda shows how leading the mind in a certain direction will held develop detachment from worldly entanglements, thus helping the soul progress on the path of liberation. Muni Pranamyasagar has written the first and only commentary on it. It has been written in ''Kādambini'' style in Sanskrit language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Muni Pranamyasagar|title=बारसाणुवेक्खा|trans-title=Baras Anuvekkha|publisher=Arhat Vidyaprakashan GoteGanv|pages=790}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Tattvarthasutra]], a 2nd Century CE text  by [[Umasvati]]. 
*Yogasastra, a 12th Century CE text by Acarya [[Hemacandra]]. Hemacandra devotes a chapter on these contemplations in his Sanskrit text, Yogasastra. 
*Maranavibhatti or Maranasamahi Painnayam – (gathas 570 – 640)
