      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7480">{{DISPLAYTITLE:(''a'',''b'',0) class of distributions}}
In [[probability theory]], the distribution of a [[discrete random variable]] ''N'' whose values are nonnegative integers is said to be a member of the '''(''a'', ''b'', 0) class of distributions''' if its [[probability mass function]] obeys

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{p_k}{p_{k-1}} = a + \frac{b}{k}, \qquad k = 1, 2, 3, \dots&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p_k = P(N = k)&lt;/math&gt; (provided &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; exist and are real).

There are only three discrete distributions that satisfy the full form of this relationship: the [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]], [[Binomial distribution|binomial]] and [[Negative binomial distribution|negative binomial]] distributions. These are also the three discrete distributions among the six members of the [[natural exponential family#Quadratic variance functions|natural exponential family with quadratic variance functions]] (NEF–QVF). 

More general distributions can be defined by fixing some initial values of ''p&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' and applying the recursion to define subsequent values. This can be of use in fitting distributions to empirical data. However, some further well-known distributions are available if the recursion above need only hold for a restricted range of values of ''k'':&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt; for example the [[logarithmic distribution]] and the discrete [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform distribution]].

The (''a'', ''b'', 0) class of distributions has important applications in [[actuarial science]] in the context of loss models.&lt;ref name=Klugman/&gt;

== Properties ==
Sundt&lt;ref name=Sundt/&gt; proved that only the [[binomial distribution]], the [[Poisson distribution]] and the [[negative binomial distribution]] belong to this class of distributions, with each distribution being represented by a different sign of&amp;nbsp;''a''. Furthermore, it was shown by Fackler&lt;ref name=Fackler/&gt; that there is a universal formula for all three distributions, called the '''(united) Panjer distribution'''.

The more usual parameters of these distributions are determined by both ''a'' and&amp;nbsp;''b''. The properties of these distributions in relation to the present class of distributions are summarised in the following table. Note that &lt;math&gt;W_N(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[probability generating function]].

|&lt;math&gt; \frac{(\alpha-1)\lambda}{\alpha+\lambda}\, &lt;/math&gt;

|&lt;math&gt; \left( 1-\frac{\lambda}{\alpha}(x-1)\right)^{-\alpha} \,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; \lambda \, &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; \lambda \left( 1 + \frac{\lambda}{\alpha} \right) \,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

Note that the Panjer distribution reduces to the Poisson distribution in the limit case &lt;math&gt;\alpha \rightarrow \pm\infty&lt;/math&gt;; it coincides with the negative binomial distribution for positive, finite real numbers &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}&lt;/math&gt;, and it equals the binomial distribution for negative integers &lt;math&gt; -\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Plotting ==
An easy way to quickly determine whether a given sample was taken from a distribution from the (''a'',''b'',0) class is by graphing the ratio of two consecutive observed data (multiplied by a constant) against the ''x''-axis.

By multiplying both sides of the recursive formula by &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, you get

: &lt;math&gt;k \, \frac{p_k}{p_{k-1}} = ak + b,&lt;/math&gt;

which shows that the left side is obviously a linear function of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. When using a sample of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; data, an approximation of the &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt;'s need to be done. If &lt;math&gt;n_k&lt;/math&gt; represents the number of observations having the value &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}_k = \frac{n_k}{n}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Estimator bias|unbiased]] estimator of the true &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, if a linear trend is seen, then it can be assumed that the data is taken from an (''a'',''b'',0) distribution. Moreover, the [[slope]] of the function would be the parameter &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, while the ordinate at the origin would be &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[meteorology]], '''absolute angular momentum''' refers to the [[angular momentum]] in an 'absolute' [[coordinate system]] ([[absolute time and space]]).

==Introduction==

Angular momentum {{math|'''L'''}} equates with the [[cross product]] of the [[position (vector)]] {{math|'''r'''}} of a particle (or [[fluid parcel]]) and its absolute linear [[momentum]] {{math|'''p'''}}, equal to {{math|&lt;var&gt;m&lt;/var&gt;'''v'''}}, the product of mass and velocity.  Mathematically,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times m \mathbf{v} &lt;/math&gt;

==Definition==

Absolute angular momentum sums the angular momentum of a  particle or fluid parcel in a relative coordinate system and the angular momentum of that relative coordinate system.

Meteorologists typically express the three vector components of velocity {{math|'''v''' {{=}} (&lt;var&gt;u&lt;/var&gt;, &lt;var&gt;v&lt;/var&gt;, &lt;var&gt;w&lt;/var&gt;)}} (eastward, northward, and upward).  The magnitude of the absolute angular momentum {{math|'''L'''}} per unit mass {{math|&lt;var&gt;m&lt;/var&gt;}}

:&lt;math&gt;\left|\frac{\mathbf{L}}{m}\right| = M = u r \cos (\phi) + \Omega r^2 \cos^2(\phi) &lt;/math&gt;

where
* {{math|&lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt;}} represents absolute angular momentum per unit mass of the fluid parcel (in {{math|{{sfrac|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|s}}}}),
* {{math|&lt;var&gt;r&lt;/var&gt;}} represents distance from the center of the earth to the fluid parcel (in {{math|m}}),
* {{math|&lt;var&gt;u&lt;/var&gt;}} represents earth-relative eastward component of velocity of the fluid parcel (in {{math|{{sfrac|m|s}}}}),
* {{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/var&gt;}} represents [[latitude]] (in {{math|rad}}), and
* {{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;Omega;&lt;/var&gt;}} represents angular rate of [[Earth's rotation]] (in {{math|{{sfrac|rad|s}} }}, usually {{math|{{sfrac|2 &amp;pi; [[radian|rad]]|1 [[sidereal day]]}} &amp;asymp; 72.921150 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; {{sfrac|rad|s}} }}).

The first term represents the angular momentum of the parcel with respect to the surface of the earth, which depends strongly on weather.  The second term represents the angular momentum of the earth itself at a particular latitude (essentially constant at least on non-geological timescales).

==Applications==

In the shallow [[troposphere]] of the earth, one can approximate {{math|&lt;var&gt;r&lt;/var&gt;&amp;asymp;&lt;var&gt;a&lt;/var&gt;}}, the distance between the fluid parcel and the center of the earth approximately equal to the mean [[Earth radius]]:

:&lt;math&gt;M \approx u a \cos (\varphi) + \Omega a^2 \cos^2(\varphi) &lt;/math&gt;

where
* {{math|&lt;var&gt;a&lt;/var&gt;}} represents [[Earth radius]] (in {{math|m}}, usually {{math|6.371009 Mm}})
* {{math|&lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt;}} represents absolute angular momentum per unit mass of the fluid parcel (in {{math|{{sfrac|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|s}}}}),
* {{math|&lt;var&gt;u&lt;/var&gt;}} represents earth-relative eastward component of velocity of the fluid parcel (in {{math|{{sfrac|m|s}}}}),
* {{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/var&gt;}} represents [[latitude]] (in {{math|rad}}), and
* {{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;Omega;&lt;/var&gt;}} represents angular rate of [[Earth's rotation]] (in {{math|{{sfrac|rad|s}} }}, usually {{math|{{sfrac|2 &amp;pi; [[radian|rad]]|1 [[sidereal day]]}} &amp;asymp; 72.921150 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; {{sfrac|rad|s}} }}).

At the North Pole and South Pole (latitude {{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}&amp;plusmn;90&amp;deg;{{=}}{{sfrac|&amp;pi;|2}}rad}}), no absolute angular momentum can exist ({{math|&lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}0 {{sfrac|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|s}} }} because {{math|cos(&amp;plusmn;90&amp;deg;){{=}}0}}).  If a fluid parcel with no eastward wind speed ({{math|&lt;var&gt;u&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}0{{sfrac|m|s}}}}) originating at the equator ({{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}0 rad}} so {{math|cos(&lt;var&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/var&gt;){{=}} cos(0 rad) {{=}} 1}}) conserves its angular momentum ({{math|&lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}}&lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt;}}) as it moves poleward, then its eastward wind speed increases dramatically:  {{math|&lt;var&gt;u&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; &lt;var&gt;a&lt;/var&gt; cos(&lt;var&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;) + &lt;var&gt;&amp;Omega;&lt;/var&gt; &lt;var&gt;a&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(&lt;var&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;) {{=}} &lt;var&gt;u&lt;/var&gt; &lt;var&gt;a&lt;/var&gt; cos(&lt;var&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/var&gt;) + &lt;var&gt;&amp;Omega;&lt;/var&gt; &lt;var&gt;a&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(&lt;var&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/var&gt;)}}.  After those substitutions, {{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;Omega;&lt;/var&gt; &lt;var&gt;a&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} &lt;var&gt;u&lt;/var&gt; &lt;var&gt;a&lt;/var&gt; cos(&lt;var&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/var&gt;) + &lt;var&gt;&amp;Omega;&lt;/var&gt; &lt;var&gt;a&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(&lt;var&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/var&gt;)}}, or after further simplification, {{math| &lt;var&gt;&amp;Omega;&lt;/var&gt; &lt;var&gt;a&lt;/var&gt;(1-cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(&lt;var&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/var&gt;)) {{=}} &lt;var&gt;u&lt;/var&gt; cos(&lt;var&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/var&gt;)}}.  Solution for {{math|&lt;var&gt;u&lt;/var&gt;}} gives {{math| &lt;var&gt;&amp;Omega;&lt;/var&gt; &lt;var&gt;a&lt;/var&gt;({{sfrac|1|cos(&lt;var&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/var&gt;)}} - cos(&lt;var&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/var&gt;)) {{=}} &lt;var&gt;u&lt;/var&gt;}}.  If {{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 15&amp;deg;}} ({{math|cos(&lt;var&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/var&gt;){{=}}{{sfrac|1+{{sqrt|3}}|2{{sqrt|2}}}}}}), then {{math| 72.921150 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; {{sfrac|rad|s}} &amp;times; 6.371009 Mm &amp;times;({{sfrac|2{{sqrt|2}}|1+{{sqrt|3}}}} - {{sfrac|1+{{sqrt|3}}|2{{sqrt|2}}}}) &amp;asymp; 32.2{{sfrac|m|s}} &amp;asymp; &lt;var&gt;u&lt;/var&gt;}}.

The [[zonal and meridional|zonal]] [[pressure gradient]] and [[eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddy]] [[stress (mechanics)|stresses]] cause [[torque]] that changes the absolute angular momentum of fluid parcels.

Abusive supervision overlaps with workplace bullying in the workplace context. Research suggests that 75% of workplace bullying incidents are perpetrated by hierarchically superior agents. Abusive supervision differs from related constructs such as supervisor bullying and undermining in that it does not describe the intentions or objectives of the supervisor.&lt;ref name=Tepper&gt;Tepper BJ Abusive supervision in work organizations: Review, synthesis, and research agenda Journal of Management June 2007 Vol 33 no 3 P261-289&lt;/ref&gt;

== Workplace deviance ==

{{Main|Workplace deviance}}
Workplace deviance is closely related to abusive supervision. Abusive supervision is defined as the "subordinates' perceptions of the extent to which their supervisors engage in the sustained display of hostile verbal and nonverbal behaviors".&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = M. | last2 = Ambrose | first2 = M.L. | year = 2007 | title = Abusive Supervision and Workplace Deviance and the Moderating Effects of Negative Reciprocity Beliefs | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 92 | issue = 4| pages = 1159–1168 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.92.4.1159 | pmid=17638473}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could be when supervisors ridicule their employees, give them the [[silent treatment]], remind them of past failures, fail to give proper credit, wrongfully assign blame or blow up in fits of temper.&lt;ref name="Larsen"&gt;James Larsen Abusive Supervision Article No. 309 Business Practice Findings&lt;/ref&gt; It may seem like employees who are abused by their supervisor will either directly retaliate or withdraw by quitting the job but in reality many strike out against their employer by engaging in organizational deviant behaviors. Since employees control many of the organization's resources, they often use, or abuse anything they can. This abuse of resources may come in the form of time, office supplies, raw materials, finished products or the services that they provide. This usually occurs in two steps. First step is that commitment is destroyed and employees stop caring about the welfare of the employer. The second step is that the abused employee will get approval (normally implied) of their coworkers to commit deviant acts.&lt;ref name= "Larsen"/&gt;

Workplace experiences may fuel the worker to [[act out]]. Research has been conducted demonstrating that the perception of not being [[respect]]ed is one of the main causes for workplace deviance; workplace dissatisfaction is also a factor. According to Bolin and Heatherly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bolin | first1 = A. | last2 = Heatherly | first2 =  | year = 2001 | title = Predictors of Employee Deviance: The Relationship between Bad Attitudes and Bad Behaviors | url = | journal = Journal of Business and Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = 3| page = 405 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "dissatisfaction results in a higher incidence of minor offenses, but does not necessarily lead to severe offense". An employee who is less satisfied with his or her work may become less productive as their needs are not met. In the workplace, "frustration, injustices and threats to self are primary antecedents to employee deviance".&lt;ref&gt;The past, present, and future of workplace deviance research.
Bennett, Rebecca J.; Robinson, Sandra L.Greenberg, Jerald (Ed), (2003). Organizational behavior: The state of the science (2nd ed.), (pp. 247-281).&lt;/ref&gt; Although workplace deviance does occur, the behavior is not universal. There are two preventive measures that business owners can use to protect themselves.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The first is strengthening the employee's commitment by reacting strongly to abusive supervision so that the employee knows that the behavior is not accepted. Holding the employee at high esteem by reminding them of their importance, or setting up programs that communicate concern for the employee may also strengthen employee commitment. Providing a positive ethical climate can also help. Employers can do this by having a clear code of conduct that is applied to both managers and employees alike.&lt;ref name= "Larsen"/&gt;

== Social undermining ==

{{Main|Social undermining}}
Social undermining can arise from abusive supervision, such as when a supervisor uses negative actions and it leads to "flow downhill";  a supervisor is perceived as abusive.

Research has shown that "abusive supervision is a subjective assessment made by subordinates regarding their supervisors"  behavior towards them over a period of time.&lt;ref name=Hoobler&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoobler | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Brass | first2 = D. J. | year = 2006 | title = Abusive supervision and family undermining as displaced aggression | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 91 | issue = 5| pages = 1125–1133 | doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.91.5.1125 | pmid=16953773}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, abusive supervision includes a "boss demeaning, belittling, or invading privacy of the subordinate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adams | first1 = S. H. | last2 = John | first2 = O. P. | year = 1997 | title = A hostility scale for the California Psychological Inventory: MMPI, observer Q-sort, and Big-five correlates | url = | journal = Journal of Personality Assessment | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 408–424 | doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa6902_11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hostile attribution bias]] is an extra punitive mentality where individuals tend to [[Psychological projection|project]] [[blame]] on others. Researchers wanted to see how hostile attribution bias can moderate the relationship between perceptions of psychological contract violation and subordinates’ perceptions of abusive supervision. Undermining does arise with abusive supervision, which affects families and aggression; they believe that there is a stronger positive relationship between experiences of psychological contract violation and subordinates’ reports of abuse. It suggests that when someone has a negative work environment, it will affect their emotional training ground where this would result in negative home encounters. The findings from this study show that abused subordinates' family members reported a higher incidence of undermining in their home. When this occurs, complications arise at both home and work. Workplace abuse may be spawning negative interpersonal relations in the home, which may contribution to a downward spiral of relationships in both spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andersson | first1 = L. M. | last2 = Pearson | first2 = C. M. | year = 1999 | title = Tit for tat? The spiraling effect of incivility in the workplace | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 452–471 | doi=10.5465/amr.1999.2202131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a subordinate is being abused, it can lead to negative affect towards their family where the subordinate starts undermining their family members. The undermining can arise from displaced aggression which is "redirection of a [person’s] harm doing behavior from a primary to a secondary target" (Tedeschi &amp; Norman, 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;30). Family undermining arises from a negative work environment: when someone above you puts you down, one starts to think that one should be put down by one's family members.&lt;ref&gt;8. Hoobler, J. M., &amp; Brass, D. J. (2006). Abusive supervision and family undermining as displaced aggression. ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', 91(5), 1125-1133. {{DOI|10.1037/0021-9010.91.5.1125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Machiavellianism ==

{{Main|Machiavellianism in the workplace}}
In research, the presence of ''[[Machiavellianism]]'' was positively associated with subordinate perceptions of abusive supervision.&lt;ref&gt;Kohyar Kiazada, Simon Lloyd D. Restubog, Thomas J.

'''Akriya''' ([[Sanskrit]]: अक्रिय ) is a Sanskrit adjective (derived from the verb ''kr'') which means – inactive, dull, torpid, without essential works, abstaining from religious rites, without action of any kind, epithet of god, worthless, good for nothing; - या ''Akriyā'' ([[Sanskrit]]: अक्रिया) means - inactivity, neglect of duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=6|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%AF&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Bhagavad Gita]], the word ''akriya'' refers to the person, who having renounced all desires and gained peace within, is not bound to perform any actions, rituals or works; such a person does not find any reason to perform any duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita Chapter 6|author=Parama Karuna Devi|publisher=Lulu.com|page=7|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1gPHBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=akriya++bhagavad+gita&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BQaxxeJQHM&amp;sig=ohjWZFsp-ltSOYyDtdRmFhB98UQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gTiMVMXGL4ygugSX94CYCw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=akriya%20%20bhagavad%20gita&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Akriyavada]]'', man’s suffering or pleasures are not because of his own actions but because of other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Buddhism and Bhagavad Gita|author=Kashinath Upadhyaya|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=90|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JBbznHuPrTYC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=akriya++bhagavad+gita&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kOa-WX12aN&amp;sig=GhPQi4IlQCuV8sBz0s2reY3yDoA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gTiMVMXGL4ygugSX94CYCw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=akriya%20%20bhagavad%20gita&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Bhagavata Purana|Śrimad Bhāgavatam]] (Sl.IX.17.10) it is learnt that the son of Rabhā was Rabhasa whose son was Gambhira who was the father of Akriya, all descendents of Ksatrvrddha rulers of Kasi. Akriya was a Brahmvida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Srimad-Bhagvatam|url= http://veda.sattvicspirit.org/bhagavatam-verse-09-17-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Krishna]] discusses the subject of ''[[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyanayoga]]'' in detail (in the 6th chapter of the [[Bhagavada Gita]])  after declaring that ''[[Samkhya|Sankhyayoga]]'' and ''[[Karma yoga]]'' both lead to the highest goal, the latter being easier of practice, [[Krishna]] tells [[Arjuna]] ([[Bhagavada Gita]] (VI.1) that :-

:अनाश्रितः कर्मफलं कार्यं कर्म करोति यः |
:स सन्यासी च योगी च न निरग्निर्न चाक्रियः ||

:"He who does his duty without expecting the fruit of actions is a Sannyasi (Sankhyayogi) and a Yogi (Karmayogi) both; he is no Sannyasi (renouncer) who has merely renounced the sacred fire; even so he is no Yogi, who has merely given up all activity."

In other words, he explains that attachment naturally stimulates desire for the fruit of actions, a ''Karmayogi'' having renounced all thoughts of the attains true knowledge which is the fruit of both disciplines; the ideal ''Yogi'' is he who having renounced all activities remains constantly engaged in meditation and whose mind is free from all evils. The word, ''Akriya'', stands for one who has totally abandoned all forms of activity and is wholly absorbed in meditation. Krishna further explains that ''[[Sannyasa]]'' is ''[[Yoga]]'' and one who has not given up thoughts of the world is not a ''Yogi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimadbhagavadgita Tattvavivecani|author=Jayadayal Goyandka|publisher=Gita Press|pages=271–273|url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Srimadbhagavadgita.html?id=NFWHMwEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Buddha]]’s time the main organised [[Sramana|Sramana schools]] were [[Buddhist]], [[Ājīvika|Ajivaka]], [[Cārvāka|Lokayata]], [[Jainism|Jain]] and [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|Ajñāna]] schools. The ''Ajivikas'' believed that each individual soul passes automatically to experience the final peace after experiencing all possible kind of life; they developed an elaborate system of divination and prognostication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dalits in Early Buddhism|author=Pramanshi Jaideva|publisher=Gyan Books|page=99|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MHy0qS2UQkMC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=akriya+buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AfOLVI7DM8ajugS8z4GYBQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=akriya%20buddhism&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; From ''Mahā-vagga'', a Jain text, it is learnt that Buddha had taught the ''akriyāvāda'' to Sīha, who was once a lay disciple of Mahāvira.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outlines of Jainism|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=xxxi|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=54A9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR31&amp;dq=akriya+buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AfOLVI7DM8ajugS8z4GYBQ&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=akriya%20buddhism&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; And, from ''Mahācittārisaka'' of the ''[[Majjhima Nikaya]]'', it is learnt that two [[Utkala Kingdom|Utkala]] tribes -  ''Vassa'' and ''Bhañña'', had renounced their faith in ''ahetuvāda'', ''akriyāvāda'' and ''nāstikavāda'' and embraced [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient India, History and Archeology|author=Dilip Kumar Ganguly|publisher=Abhinav Publications|page=83|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=N2tlKzxwhY8C&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=akriya+buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AfOLVI7DM8ajugS8z4GYBQ&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=akriya%20buddhism&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Akriyā-vāda'' or the Doctrine of Non-action, which greatly influenced the [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] thought was propounded by Purana Kassapa, who died in 499 BCE (or 503 BCE), and was a contemporary of [[Buddha]] and [[Mahavira]] both of whom had rejected this doctrine according to which the soul is passive and no action, good or bad affects the soul, and therefore, there is no cause or effect (consequence) and no merits or demerits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World|publisher=Concept Publishing|page=305|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WjDcd0cTFxQC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=akriya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ne-LVMuMDMbguQScuoH4CQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=akriya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Advaita Vedanta|Mayavada]] of [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]], - what the mind sees is a reality, it is the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], it is [[Brahman]] but the ideas, the terms in which the mind sees is false, what it sees is not the truth. Buddha had not defined [[Nirvana]] and had remained vague, but Shankara by terming the action-less and peaceful Atman as ''shanta akriya Sacchidananda'' accepted that the law of [[karma]] was applicable to this false world and replaced the notion of the [[Anatta|non-self]] with the knowledge of the real self,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Upanishads|publisher=Sri Aurobindo Ashrama|page=498|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=f4XsuPPjQlIC&amp;pg=PA498&amp;dq=akriya+buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p_SLVPTVJNCKuwTO5oH4Cg&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=akriya%20buddhism&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is so because according to [[Advaita Vedanta]], [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] is actionless (''akriya''), changeless and eternal (''kutasthanitya''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Thousand Teachings|author=Sengaku Mayeda|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=207|url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=3Jc9RHYN3qsC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=akriya+buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p_SLVPTVJNCKuwTO5oH4Cg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=akriya%20buddhism&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to [[Shuddhadvaita|Śuddhādvaita]] of [[Vallabha Acharya|Vallabhacarya]], the three [[lakshana]]s of the [[Jiva|Jivātman]] are – a) it is cognized through I-consciousness, it is beginning-less, [[nirguna]] and regulator of [[Prakṛti]], b) its nature is self-luminosity and c) associated with though unaffected by [[Guṇa|gunas]] and ''dosas'' of the universe it is eligible for liberation; by nature ''akriya'' ('non-doer') assumes the role of the ''karta'' ('doer') and the ''karma'' ('object').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kalatattvakosa|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=63|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=q1XoNhUrP1MC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=akriya+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=d_WLVLW-IYiVuASs2oH4BA&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=akriya%20vedanta&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some well-known alternative [[fuel]]s include [[biodiesel]], [[bioalcohol]] ([[methanol]], [[ethanol]], [[n-Butanol|butanol]]), [[refuse-derived fuel]], chemically stored [[electricity]] (batteries and [[fuel cell]]s), [[hydrogen]], non-fossil [[methane]], non-fossil [[natural gas]], [[Vegetable oil fuel|vegetable oil]], [[propane]] and other [[biomass]] sources.

==Background==
The main purpose of fuel is to store energy, which should be in a stable form and can be easily transported to the place of use.

Almost all fuels are chemical fuels. The user employs this fuel to generate heat or perform mechanical work, such as powering an engine. It may also be used to generate electricity, which is then used for heating, lighting, or other purpose.

==Biofuel==

Biofuels are also considered a renewable source. Although renewable energy is used mostly to generate electricity, it is often assumed that some form of renewable energy or a percentage is used to create alternative fuels.
Research is ongoing into finding more suitable biofuel crops and improving the oil yields of these crops. Using the current yields, vast amounts of land and fresh water would be needed to produce enough oil to completely replace fossil fuel usage.

===Biomass===
{{Main|Biomass}}
Biomass in the energy production industry is living and recently dead [[biotic material|biological material]] which can be used as fuel or for industrial production.
It has become popular among coal power stations, which switch from coal to biomass in order to convert to renewable energy generation without wasting existing generating plant and infrastructure. Biomass most often refers to plants or plant-based materials that are not used for food or feed, and are specifically called lignocellulosic biomass.[2] As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel.

===Algae-based fuels===
{{Main|Algae fuel}}

Algae-based biofuels have been promoted in the media as a potential panacea to crude oil-based transportation problems. Algae could yield more than 2000 gallons of fuel per acre per year of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenworldinvestor.com/2010/06/04/is-algae-based-biofuel-a-great-green-investment-opportunity/ |title= Is Algae Based Biofuel a Great Green Investment Opportunity |publisher=Green World Investor |date= 2010-04-06 |accessdate=2010-07-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100617064204/http://greenworldinvestor.com/2010/06/04/is-algae-based-biofuel-a-great-green-investment-opportunity/| archivedate= 17 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algae based fuels are being successfully tested by the U.S. Navy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinelog.com/DOCS/NEWSMMIX/2010oct00223.html |title= Navy demonstrates alternative fuel in riverine vessel |publisher=Marine Log |date= 2010-10-22 |accessdate=2010-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algae-based plastics show potential to reduce waste and the cost per pound of algae plastic is expected to be cheaper than traditional plastic prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartplanet.com/technology/blog/science-scope/can-algae-based-plastics-reduce-our-plastic-footprint/1605/ |title= Can algae-based plastics reduce our plastic footprint? |publisher=Smart Planet |date= 2009-10-07 |accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biodiesel===

[[Biodiesel]] is made from animal fats or vegetable oils, renewable resources that come from plants such as jatropha, soybean, sunflowers, corn, olive, peanut, palm, coconut, safflower, canola, sesame, cottonseed, etc. Once these fats or oils are filtered from their hydrocarbons and then combined with alcohol like methanol, biodiesel is brought to life{{Clarify|date=October 2013}} from this chemical reaction. These raw materials can either be mixed with pure diesel to make various proportions, or used alone. Despite one’s mixture preference, biodiesel will release smaller number of pollutants (carbon monoxide particulates and hydrocarbons) than conventional diesel, because biodiesel burns both cleanly and more efficiently. Even with regular diesel’s reduced quantity of sulfur from the ULSD (ultra-low sulfur diesel) invention, biodiesel exceeds those levels because it is sulfur-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Jill|title=Alternative Cars|isbn=978-1-59928-803-1|page=21|date=2008|publisher=ABDO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alcohol fuels==
{{Main|Alcohol fuel|Butanol fuel|Ethanol fuel|Methanol fuel}}

Methanol and ethanol fuel are primary sources of energy; they are convenient fuels for storing and transporting energy.  These alcohols can be used in internal combustion engines as alternative fuels. Butanol has another advantage: it is the only alcohol-based motor fuel that can be transported readily by existing petroleum-product pipeline networks, instead of only by tanker trucks and railroad cars.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

== Ammonia ==
[[Ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can be used as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.agmrc.org/renewable_energy/renewable_energy/ammonia-as-a-transportation-fuel/ | title = Ammonia as a transportation fuel | author = Don Hofstrand | publisher = AgMRC Renewable Energy Newsletter | date = May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nh3fuelassociation.org/about/ | title = NH3 Fuel Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Benefits of ammonia include no need for oil, zero emissions, low cost, and distributed production reducing transport and related pollution.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Carbon-neutral and negative fuels ==

[[Carbon neutral fuel]] is [[synthetic fuel]]—such as [[methane]], [[gasoline]], [[diesel fuel]] or [[jet fuel]]—produced from [[renewable energy|renewable]] or [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]] used to [[hydrogenation|hydrogenate]] waste [[carbon dioxide]] recycled from [[flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion|power plant flue]] [[exhaust gas]] or derived from [[carbonic acid]] in [[seawater]].&lt;ref name=Zeman2008&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeman |first=Frank S. |last2=Keith |first2=David W. |date=2008 |title=Carbon neutral hydrocarbons |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]] |volume=366 |pages=3901–18 |doi=10.1098/rsta.2008.0143 |url=http://www.keith.seas.harvard.edu/papers/103.Zeman.2008.CHNCs.e.pdf |accessdate=September 7, 2012 |bibcode=2008RSPTA.366.3901Z |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525135837/http://www.keith.seas.harvard.edu/papers/103.Zeman.2008.CHNCs.e.pdf |archivedate=May 25, 2013 }} (Review.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wang2012&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Wang |first= Wei |last2= Wang |first2= Shengping |last3= Ma |first3= Xinbin |last4= Gong |first4= Jinlong |date= 2011 |title= Recent advances in catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide |journal= Chemical Society Reviews |volume= 40 |issue= 7 |pages= 3703–27 |doi= 10.1039/C1CS15008A |url= http://69.12.216.122/co2hydrogenation.pdf |accessdate= September 7, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (Review.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MacDowell2010&gt;{{Cite journal |last= MacDowell |first = Niall |date= 2010 |title= An overview of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture technologies |journal= Energy and Environmental Science |volume= 3 |issue= 11 |pages= 1645–69 |doi= 10.1039/C004106H |url= http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2010/EE/c004106h |accessdate= September 7, 2012|display-authors=etal}} (Review.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eisaman2012&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eisaman |first=Matthew D. |date=2012 |title=CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; extraction from seawater using bipolar membrane electrodialysis |journal=Energy and Environmental Science |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=7346–52 |doi=10.1039/C2EE03393C |url=http://69.12.216.122/co2extraction.pdf |accessdate=September 7, 2012 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121122815/http://69.12.216.122/co2extraction.pdf |archivedate=January 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such fuels are potentially [[carbon neutral]] because they do not result in a net increase in atmospheric [[greenhouse gas]]es.&lt;ref name=Graves2011rev&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Graves |first= Christopher |last2= Ebbesen |first2= Sune D. |last3= Mogensen |first3= Mogens |last4= Lackner |first4= Klaus S. |date= 2011 |title= Sustainable hydrocarbon fuels by recycling CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O with renewable or nuclear energy |journal= Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume= 15 |issue= 1 |pages= 1–23 |doi= 10.1016/j.rser.2010.07.014 |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032110001942 |accessdate= September 7, 2012}} (Review.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Socolow2011&gt;{{Cite report |last= Socolow |first= Robert |date= June 1, 2011 |title= ''Direct Air Capture of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with Chemicals: A Technology Assessment for the APS Panel on Public Affairs'' |publisher= American Physical Society |type= peer reviewed literature review |url= http://www.aps.org/policy/reports/assessments/upload/dac2011.pdf |accessdate= September 7, 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent that carbon neutral fuels displace [[fossil fuel]]s, or if they are produced from waste carbon or seawater carbonic acid, and their combustion is subject to [[carbon capture]] at the flue or exhaust pipe, they result in [[negative carbon dioxide emission]] and net [[carbon dioxide removal]] from the atmosphere, and thus constitute a form of [[greenhouse gas remediation]].&lt;ref name=Goeppert2012&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Goeppert |first= Alain |last2= Czaun |first2= Miklos |last3= Prakash |first3= G.K.

Carbon-neutral fuels have been proposed for [[Power storage#Synthetic hydrocarbon fuel|distributed storage for renewable energy]], minimizing problems of wind and solar [[intermittency]], and enabling transmission of wind, water, and solar power through existing natural gas pipelines.

[[HCNG]] (or H2CNG) is a mixture of [[compressed natural gas]] and 4-9 percent [[hydrogen]] by energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/fuels/natural_gas_blends.html |title= Hydrogen/Natural Gas (HCNG) Fuel Blends |publisher=Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)  |date= 2009-10-07 |accessdate=2010-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liquid nitrogen==
[[Liquid nitrogen vehicle|Liquid nitrogen]] is another type of emissionless and efficient fuel.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Compressed air==
The [[Pneumatic motor|air engine]] is an emission-free piston engine using [[compressed air]] as fuel. Unlike hydrogen, compressed air is about one-tenth as expensive as fossil fuel, making it an economically attractive alternative fuel.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Propane autogas==
{{Main|Autogas}}
[[Propane]] is a cleaner burning, high performance fuel derived from multiple sources. It is known by many names including propane, LPG (liquified propane gas), LPA (liquid propane autogas), Autogas and others. Propane is a hydrocarbon fuel and is a member of the natural gas family.

Propane as an automotive fuel shares many of the physical attributes of gasoline while reducing tailpipe emissions and well to wheel emissions overall. Propane is the number one alternative fuel in the world and offers an abundance of supply, liquid storage at low pressure, an excellent safety record and large cost savings when compared to traditional fuels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.driveclean.ca.gov/Search_and_Explore/Technologies_and_Fuel_Types/Propane.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Propane delivers an octane rating between 104 and 112&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/propane.html&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the composition of the butane/propane ratios of the mixture. Propane autogas in a liquid injection format captures the phase change from liquid to gas state within the cylinder of the combustion engine producing an "intercooler" effect, reducing the cylinder temperature and increasing air density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wlpga.org/glotec/57/265/Direct-Injection-Liquid-Propane |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141214141910/http://wlpga.org/glotec/57/265/Direct-Injection-Liquid-Propane |archivedate=2014-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resultant effect allows more advance on the ignition cycle and a more efficient engine combustion.

Propane lacks additives, detergents or other chemical enhancements further reducing the exhaust output from the tailpipe. The cleaner combustion also has fewer particulate emissions, lower NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; due to the complete combustion of the gas within the cylinder, higher exhaust temperatures increasing the efficiency of the catalyst and deposits less acid and carbon inside the engine which extends the useful life of the lubricating oil.

Propane autogas is generated at the well alongside other natural gas and oil products. It is also a by-product of the refining processes which further increase the supply of Propane to the market.

Propane is stored and transported in a liquid state at roughly {{convert|5|bar|psi|abbr=on}} of pressure. Fueling vehicles is similar to gasoline in speed of delivery with modern fueling equipment. Propane filling stations only require a pump to transfer vehicle fuel and does not require expensive and slow compression systems when compared to [[compressed natural gas]] which is usually kept at over {{convert|3000|psi|bar|abbr=on}}.

In a vehicle format, propane autogas can be retrofitted to almost any engine and provide fuel cost savings and lowered emissions while being more efficient as an overall system due to the large, pre-existing propane fueling infrastructure that does not require compressors and the resultant waste of other alternative fuels in well to wheel lifecycles.

==Natural gas vehicles==
[[Compressed natural gas]] (CNG) and [[liquified natural gas]] (LNG) are two cleaner combusting alternatives to conventional liquid [[automobile]] fuels.

=== Compressed natural gas fuel types ===
Compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles can use both renewable CNG and non-renewable CNG.&lt;ref name="Frick, Martin, Kay W. Axhausen, Gian Carle, and Alexander Wokaun. 2007 10–22"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frick |first=Martin |first2=Kay W. |last2=Axhausen |first3=Gian |last3=Carle |first4=Alexander |last4=Wokaun |title=Optimization of the distribution of compressed natural gas (CNG) refueling stations: Swiss case studies|journal=Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment |date=2007 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=10–22|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920906000691 |doi=10.1016/j.trd.2006.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional CNG is produced from the many underground natural gas reserves are in widespread production worldwide today.  New technologies such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to economically access unconventional gas resources,  appear to have increased the supply of natural gas in a fundamental way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cngva.org/media/4302/marbek_ngv_final_report-april_2010.pdf |title=Study of Opportunities for natural gas in the transportation sector |publisher=Natural Resources Canada |author=Marbek |date=March 2010 |accessdate=2013-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411134857/http://www.cngva.org/media/4302/marbek_ngv_final_report-april_2010.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable natural gas or biogas is a methane‐based gas with similar properties to natural gas that can be used as transportation fuel.  Present sources of biogas are mainly landfills,  sewage,  and animal/agri‐waste.  Based on the process type,  biogas can be divided into the following:  biogas produced by anaerobic digestion, [[landfill gas]] collected from landfills,  treated to remove trace contaminants, and synthetic natural gas (SNG).&lt;ref name="Frick, Martin, Kay W. Axhausen, Gian Carle, and Alexander Wokaun. 2007 10–22"/&gt;

=== Practicality ===
Around the world, this gas powers more than 5 million vehicles, and just over 150,000 of these are in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Jill|title=Alternative Cars|isbn=978-1-59928-803-1|page=26|date=2008|publisher=ABDO}}&lt;/ref&gt; American usage is growing at a dramatic rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/files/2012/09/17-Pedersen.pdf |title=Association of Taxicab Operators, USA v.

=== Environmental analysis ===
Because natural gas emits little pollutant when combusted, cleaner air quality has been measured in urban localities switching to natural gas vehicles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goyal |first=P |title=Present scenario of air quality in Delhi: a case study of CNG implementation |journal=Atmospheric Environment |date=2003 |url=http://eprint.iitd.ac.in:8080/bitstream/2074/1487/1/goyalpre2003.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2003.09.005 |volume=37 |pages=5423–5431 |bibcode=2003AtmEn..37.5423G }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tailpipe {{CO2}} can be reduced by 15–25% compared to gasoline, diesel.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236105003303 |title=An experimental investigation of CNG as an alternative fuel for a retrofitted gasoline vehicle |journal=Fuel |first=M.U. |last=Aslam |first2=H.H. |last2=Masjuki |first3=M.A. |last3=Kalam |first4=H. |last4=Abdesselam |first5=T.M.I. |last5=Mahlia |first6=M.A. |last6=Amalina  |volume=85 |issue=5–6 |date=March–April 2006 |pages=717–724 |accessdate=2013-02-19 |doi=10.1016/j.fuel.2005.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest reductions occur in medium and heavy duty, light duty and refuse truck segments.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

{{CO2}} reductions of up to 88%  are possible by using biogas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nylund |first=Nils-Olof |first2=Alex |last2=Lawson |title=Exhaust emissions from natural gas vehicles |journal= IANGV Emission Report |date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Similarities to hydrogen '''
Natural gas, like hydrogen, is another fuel that burns cleanly; cleaner than both gasoline and diesel engines. Also, none of the smog-forming contaminates are emitted.  Hydrogen and natural gas are both lighter than air and can be mixed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mathai |first=Reji |title=Comparative evaluation of performance, emission, lubricant and deposit characteristics of spark ignition engine fueled with CNG and 18% hydrogen-CNG |journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy |date=2012 |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319912001796 |doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.01.083 |volume=37 |pages=6893–6900|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear power and radiothermal generators==
{{Main|Nuclear power|radiothermal generator}}

=== Nuclear reactors ===
Nuclear power is any [[nuclear technology]] designed to extract usable energy from [[atomic nuclei]] via controlled [[nuclear reactions]]. The only controlled method now practical uses [[nuclear fission]] in a [[fissile]] fuel (with a small fraction of the power coming from subsequent [[radioactive decay]]). Use of the nuclear reaction [[nuclear fusion]] for controlled power generation is not yet practical, but is an active area of research.

Nuclear power is usually used by using a [[nuclear reactor]] to heat a working fluid such as water, which is then used to create steam pressure, which is converted into mechanical work for the purpose of generating electricity or propulsion in water. Today, more than 15% of the world's electricity comes from nuclear power, and over 150 nuclear-powered naval vessels have been built.

In theory, electricity from nuclear reactors could also be used for [[nuclear propulsion|propulsion]] in space, but this has yet to be demonstrated in a space flight. Some smaller reactors, such as the [[TOPAZ nuclear reactor]], are built to minimize moving parts, and use methods that convert nuclear energy to electricity more directly, making them useful for space missions, but this electricity has historically been used for other purposes. Power from [[nuclear fission]] has been used in a number of spacecraft, all of them unmanned. The Soviets up to 1988 orbited 33 nuclear reactors in [[RORSAT]] military radar satellites, where electric power generated was used to power a radar unit that located ships on the Earth's oceans. The U.S. also orbited one experimental nuclear reactor in 1965, in the [[SNAP-10A]] mission. No nuclear reactor has been sent into space since 1988.

===Thorium fuelled nuclear reactors===

[[Thorium-based nuclear power]] reactors have also become an area of active research in recent years. It is being backed by many scientists and researchers, and Professor James Hansen, the former Director at [[NASA]] Goddard Institute for Space Studies has reportedly said, “After studying [[climate change]] for over four decades, it’s clear to me that the world is heading for a climate catastrophe unless we develop adequate energy sources to replace [[fossil fuels]]. Safer, cleaner and cheaper nuclear power can replace coal and is desperately needed as an essential part of the solution”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-weinberg-foundation.org/about/endorsements/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thorium]] is 3-4 times more abundant within nature than [[uranium]], and its ore, [[monazite]], is commonly found in sands along bodies of water. Thorium has also gained interest because it could be easier to obtain than uranium. While [[uranium mines]] are enclosed underground and thus very dangerous for the miners, thorium is taken from open pits.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2015/01/16/thorium-future-nuclear-energy/#.VPfjkXbFo1w&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www-pub.iaea.org"&gt;{{cite web|author=International Atomic Energy Agency|title=Thorium fuel cycle — Potential benefits and challenges|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/TE_1450_web.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monazite is present in countries such as Australia, the United States and India, in quantities large enough to power the earth for thousands of years.&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;{{cite web|last1=Juhasz|first1=Albert J.|last2=Rarick|first2=Richard A.|last3=Rangarajan|first3=Rajmohan|title=High Efficiency Nuclear Power Plants Using Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor Technology|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090038711.pdf|website=NASA|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As an alternative to uranium fuelled nuclear reactors, thorium has been proven to add to proliferation, produces [[radioactive waste]] for [[deep geological repository|deep geological repositories]] like [[technetium-99]] (half-life over 200,000 years),&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieer.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/thorium2009factsheet.pdf Thorium fuel No panacea for nuclear power]&lt;/ref&gt; and has a longer fuel cycle.&lt;ref name="www-pub.iaea.org"/&gt;

For a list of experimental and presently-operating thorium-fueled reactors, see [[thorium fuel cycle#List of thorium fueled reactors]].

=== Radiothermal generators ===
In addition, [[radioisotope]]s have been used as alternative fuels, on both land and in space. Their use on land is declining due to the danger of theft of isotope and environmental damage if the unit is opened. The decay of radioisotopes generates both heat and electricity in many space probes, particularly probes to outer planets where sunlight is weak, and low temperatures is a problem. [[Radiothermal generator]]s (RTGs) which use such radioisotopes as fuels do not sustain a nuclear chain reaction, but rather generate electricity from the decay of a radioisotope which has (in turn) been produced on Earth as a concentrated power source (fuel) using energy from an Earth-based [[nuclear reactor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space4peace.org/ianus/npsm2.htm |title=Nuclear Powered Space Missions - Past and Future |first=Regina |last=Hagen |publisher=Space4peace.org |date=1998-08-11 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hindu philosophy}}
'''Anavrtti'''  ({{Lang-sa|अनावृत्ति}}) is a [[Vedic]] term which means – non-return to a body, final emancipation. This word refers to the [[Jivanmukta]].

==Overview==

'''Anavrtti''' means path of no return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bhagavad Gita|publisher=Shambala Publications|page=480|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=V0exkVFiyvcC&amp;pg=PA480&amp;dq=anavrtti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HNVAU8LAKYaYrAeB-4CYBA&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=anavrtti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It indicates the non-return of the soul to a new body, and refers to the end of the seemingly endless vicious cycle of birth, death and rebirth, the transmigration of soul from one body to another. [[Badarayana]] concludes with the statement: - अनावृत्तिः शब्दादनावृत्तिः शब्दात् || ([[Brahma Sutras|Brahma sutra]] IV.iv.22) – "There is no return for the released souls on the strength of the upanishadic declaration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Brahma sutra – the philosophy of spiritual life |author=Badarayana|publisher=Harper|page=911|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=U-gAAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=anavrtti&amp;dq=anavrtti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hdZAU7LEEMSFrQfS5YCADA&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAjgK }}&lt;/ref&gt; This word, characterized by no return, is very common in [[Vedanta]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Linguistics Vol.16|publisher=Linguistic Society of India|page=319|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fLISAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=anavrtti&amp;dq=anavrtti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=S9hAU9XZGoWIrQey84CYDA&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBzgU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Upanishadic connection==

Before concluding his deliberation on [[Brahman]], Badarayana explains that the released souls are of two kinds – with or without bodies and senses; that the released soul gets all the divine powers except running the universe, and that Brahman does not abide in the effect as shown by  [[Chandogya Upanishad]] (III.xii.6) –

:तावानस्य महिमा ततो ज्यायाश्च पूरुषः |
:पादोऽस्य सर्वा भूतानि त्रिपादस्यामृतं दिवि ||

:" His divine majesty spreads that far; the whole universe of all these beings is but a quadrant of His. But Purusa (the infinite Being) is greater than that, His three immortal quadrants being established in His own effulgence."

He states that Brahman is the supreme Light beyond all changing things with which there is equality of experience alone. Having reached that state there is no return for the released soul. In this context [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] states that Badarayana reiterates - तेषां न पुनरावृत्तिः ("They no more return to this world") ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] VI.ii.15) or न च पुनरावर्तते ("He does not return again") ([[Chandogya Upanishad]] VIII.xv.1), and adds that non-return stands as an accomplished fact for those from whom the darkness of ignorance has been completely removed as a result of their full illumination and who therefore cling to that liberation as their highest goal which exists ever as an already established fact; the non-return of those who take refuge in the qualified Brahman becomes a fact only because they too have that unconditioned Brahman as their ultimate resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya of Sankaracarya|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=904–912|url=https://advaitaashrama.org/Book/Detail/8121|access-date=2014-04-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224112052/https://advaitaashrama.org/Book/Detail/8121|archive-date=2013-12-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Rig Vedic connection==

The concept of Anavrtti has a direct relation with the concept of Transmigration of Souls. [[Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade]] in his book, [[A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy]] finds the concept of [[Reincarnation|Transmigration of Souls]] developing in the [[Rig Veda]]. He draws our attention to the following [[mantra]]s of Sukta 164 of [[Rishi]] [[Dirghatamas]]:-

:को ददर्श प्रथमं जायमानमस्थन्वन्तं यदनस्था बिभर्ति |
:भूम्या असुरसृगात्मा क्वं स्वित्को विद्वांसमुपगात्प्रष्टमेतत् ||

whereby the Rishi asks, who has ever seen the precise mode in which the boneless soul, the very life-blood and informing spirit of the earth, comes to inhabit a bony tenement? And if a man did not know this himself, who has ever moved out of himself and gone to the wise man to receive illumination on it? ([[Rig Veda]] I.164.4), that

:अनच्छये तुरगातु जीवमेजद्ध्रुवं मध्य आ पस्त्यानाम् |
:जीवो मृतस्य चरति स्वधाभिरमत्र्यो मत्र्येना सयोनिः ||

this breathing, speedful, moving life-principle is firmly established inside these tenements ([[Rig Veda]] I.164.30), that

:अपाङ् प्राङेति स्वधया गृभीतोऽमत्र्यो मत्रेना सयोनिः |
:ता शश्वन्ता विषूचीना वियन्तान्य१न्यं चिक्युर्न नि चिक्युरन्यम् ||

the  immortal principle, conjoined with the mortal one, moves backwards and forwards by virtue of its natural power; these two elements keep moving ceaselessly in opposite directions, with the result that people are able to see the one but are unable to see the other ([[Rig Veda]] I.164.38); that

:अपश्यं गोपामनिपद्यमानमा च परा च पथिभिश्चरन्तम् |
:स सध्रीचोः स विषूचीर्वसान आ वरीवर्त्ति भुवनेष्वन्तः ||

the Rishi tells us he himself saw (with his mind’s eye) the guardian of the body, moving unerringly by backward and forward paths, clothed in collected and diffusive splendor, only to keep returning frequently inside the mundane regions ([[Rig Veda]] I.164.31);

:ये अर्वाञ्च्स्ताँ उ पराच आहुर्ये पराञ्च्स्ताँ उ अर्वाच आहुः |
:इन्द्रश्च वा चक्रथुः सोम तानि धुरा न युक्ता रजसो वहन्ति ||

and talks of those who come hither as those who are moving away, and those who are moving back as already returning hither ([[Rig Veda]] I.164.19)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy 1986 Ed.|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|pages=108–109|url=https://openlibrary.org/works/OL11038873W/A_constructive_survey_of_Upanishadic_philosophy_being_an_introduction_to_the_thought_of_the_Upanisha }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Implication==

[[Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade]] clarifies that whenever there is recognized the possibility of the soul coming to inhabit a body as a god-like principle from without, wherever it is supposed that the soul could likewise part from the body as it came, wherever it is thought that the soul after parting from the body could lead a life of disembodied existence, and wherever it is supposed to return again to the earth and inhabit any form of existence whatsoever, there is a kind of undying life conceived for the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy 1986 Ed.|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=109|url=https://openlibrary.org/works/OL11038873W/A_constructive_survey_of_Upanishadic_philosophy_being_an_introduction_to_the_thought_of_the_Upanisha }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] explains that the competent man, while performing all prescribed things in the householders life itself, living in the way described, to the end of his life, attains after death the world of Brahman and does not return again for becoming embodied. From the negation of return (न च पुनरावर्तते) which must occur as a matter of course, it follows that having reached the world of [[Hiranyagarbha]] through the Path of Light etc., he stays there as long as the world of Hiranyagarbha lasts, i.e. before that he does not return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chandogya Upanishad First edition|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|page=673|url=https://advaitaashrama.org/Book/Detail/264 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice is the psychic death, the death that means the business of realization of our otherness out of love of true liberation, which is achieved by knowledge that even transcends abstract reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Upanishads Vol.3|author=Swami Parameshwaranad|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|page=368|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-7PpmaKjLvUC&amp;pg=PA369&amp;dq=anavrtti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eNdAU5yPFIb8rAfNiIGYDA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=anavrtti&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of Liberation==

The [[Jivanmukta]] on exhaustion of the [[Prarabdha karma]] attains [[Videha mukti]] (freedom from the body) at death and becomes one with [[Brahman]]. At the time of death the functions of the organs (Speech etc.) are merged in the mind ([[Brahma Sutras]] IV.ii.1). Then the mind is merged in [[Prana]], and the Prana (the vital force) gets merged in the [[Jiva]] (the individual Soul) ([[Brahma Sutras]] IV.ii.3-4). This mode of departure is common for both the knower of the [[Saguna brahman|Saguna Brahman]] and the ignorant up to the beginning of their ways leading to immortality because it is something pertaining to this life. The subtle body lasts up to the attainment of Brahman. Pranas of the knower of the [[Nirguna Brahman]] do not depart from the individual soul, the soul passes out of the body with the Pranas which become merged in Brahman, and absolute non-distinction with Brahman takes place – अविभागः, वचनात् (Brahma Sutras IV.ii.16). The soul of the knower of the Saguna Brahman comes to the heart at the time of death and thence goes out through the Susumna; it then follows the rays of the sun after death and goes to [[Brahmapura|Brahmaloka]] – रश्म्यनुसारी (Brahma Sutras VI.ii.18). The texts refer to different paths and give their descriptions but [[Badarayana]] tells us that they refer to and give only different particulars of the same path – अर्चिरादिना, तत्प्रथितेः (Brahma Sutras IV.iii.1)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutras|author=Badarayana|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=426–439, 443|url= http://advaitaashrama.org/Book/Search/Author=Swami%20Vireswarananda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impersonal immortality==

[[Mundaka Upanishad]] (III.ii.6-9) states that at the supreme moment of final departure having become identified with the supreme Immortality (Brahman) they pure in mind become freed on every side. To their resources repair the fifteen constituents (of the body) and to their respective gods go all the gods (of the senses), and the karmas and the soul that stimulates the intellect, all become unified with the supreme Undecaying (परेऽव्यये). As rivers, flowing down, become indistinguishable on reaching the sea by giving up their names and forms, so also the illumined soul, having become freed from name and form, reaches the self-effulgent Purusa that is higher than the higher Immutable; this Self is not attained by one devoid of strength, nor through delusion, nor through knowledge unassociated with monasticism, but the Self of that knower, who strives through these means, enters into the abode that is Brahman (ब्रह्मधाम).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eight Upanishads|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=163–169|url=http://library.techworm.co.in/selected-picks/eight-upanishads-with-the-commentary-of-sankaracharya-translated-by-swami-gambhirananda }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is absorption in divinity, this is the Doctrine of Impersonal Immortality. [[Kaushitaki Upanishad]] (I.4) tells us that when the soul comes to the Path of the Gods, the soul first goes to the world of Fire, then to the world of the Wind, to the world of Varuna, to that of the Sun, of Indra, of Prajapati, and finally to the world of Brahman. The soul knowing Brahman crosses the Ageless river merely by the motion of the mind and being free from good and free from evil moves towards Brahman.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3217">{{Antennas|characteristics}}

In [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] theory, antenna efficiency is most often used to mean '''radiation efficiency'''. In the context of antennas, one often just speaks of "efficiency." It is a measure of the [[electrical efficiency]] with which a radio antenna converts the radio-frequency power accepted at its terminals into radiated power. Likewise, in a receiving antenna it describes the proportion of the radio wave's power intercepted by the antenna which is actually delivered as an electrical signal. It is not to be confused with [[Aperture efficiency (antennas)|aperture efficiency]] which applies to aperture antennas such as the [[parabolic reflector]].

==Definition==

Radiation efficiency is defined by [[IEEE]] Std 145-1993&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Std 145-1993, Standard Definitions of Terms for Antennas, {{ISBN|1-55937-317-2}}, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IEEESTD.1993.119664 IEEEXplore]&lt;/ref&gt; "Standard Definitions of Terms for Antennas" as "The ratio of the total power radiated by an antenna to the net power accepted by the antenna from the connected transmitter." It is sometimes expressed as a percentage (less than 100), and is frequency dependent.  It can also be described in [[decibels]]. 

For wire antennas which have a defined [[radiation resistance]] the radiation efficiency is the ratio of the radiation resistance to the total resistance of the antenna including ground loss (see below) and conductor resistance. &lt;ref&gt;Weelkes, W.J, (1968), ''Antenna Engineering'', McGraw Hill Book Company, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; In practical cases the resistive loss in any tuning and/or matching network is often included, although network loss is strictly not a property of the antenna.  

For other types of antenna the radiation efficiency is less easy to calculate and is usually determined by measurements.  

The [[antenna gain|gain]] of an antenna is the [[directivity]] multiplied by the radiation efficiency, as described in Std 145-1993.    

==Ground loss==

For [[monopole antenna|monopole]] and other ground-based antennas, ground loss occurs due to ohmic [[electrical resistance|resistance]] in the antenna's connection to its ground plane/counterpoise, including its mast or stalk and its bonding connections, as well as the ohmic resistance encountered by radio-frequency currents in the ground plane in the vicinity of the antenna.

==Aperture efficiency==
{{main|Aperture efficiency (antennas)}}
This is a distinct concept applied to aperture antennas such as a [[parabolic antenna]] and is a measure of the reduction in power gain caused by non-uniform aperture illumination by the feed antenna.  In a typical situation the reflector is illuminated with a reduced power-density at the edge compared with the centre, in order to reduce [[side lobe|sidelobes]] and other effects.  This causes a reduction in gain: the ratio of the gain of the tapered aperture distribution to the theoretical gain of a uniformly illuminated aperture is the aperture efficiency. &lt;ref&gt;Weelkes, W.J, (1968), ''Antenna Engineering'', McGraw Hill Book Company, pp. 256-258&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artificial consciousness'''&lt;ref name="gunn"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thaler | first1 = S. L. | year = 1998 | title = The emerging intelligence and its critical look at us | url = | journal = Journal of Near-Death Studies | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 21–29| doi = 10.1023/A:1022990118714 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''AC'''), also known as '''machine consciousness''' ('''MC''') or '''synthetic consciousness''' ({{harvnb|Gamez|2008}}; {{harvnb|Reggia|2013}}), is a field related to [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive robotics]]. The aim of the [[Scientific theory|theory]] of artificial consciousness is to "Define that which would have to be synthesized were consciousness to be found in an engineered artifact" {{Harv|Aleksander|1995}}.

[[Neuroscience]] hypothesizes that [[consciousness]] is generated by the interoperation of various parts of the [[brain]], called the [[neural correlates of consciousness]] or NCC, though there are challenges to that perspective. Proponents of AC believe it is possible to construct [[system]]s (e.g., [[computer]] systems) that can emulate this NCC interoperation.&lt;ref name="Graziano Consciousness and the Social Brain"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graziano|first1=Michael|title=Consciousness and the Social Brain|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199928644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial consciousness concepts are also pondered in the philosophy of [[artificial intelligence]] through [[philosophy of artificial intelligence#Can a machine have a mind, consciousness, and mental states?|questions about mind, consciousness, and mental states]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]'' includes the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] foundations of AI including the questions of consciousness http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html, Russell, Stuart J., Norvig, Peter, 2003, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|0-13-790395-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical views==
As there are many hypothesized [[Consciousness#Types of consciousness|types of consciousness]], there are many potential implementations of artificial consciousness.  In the philosophical literature, perhaps the most common taxonomy of consciousness is into "access" and "phenomenal" variants.  Access consciousness concerns those aspects of [[experience]] that can be apprehended, while phenomenal consciousness concerns those aspects of experience that seemingly cannot be apprehended, instead being characterized qualitatively in terms of “raw feels”, “what it is like” or [[qualia]] ({{harvnb|Block|1997}}).

=== Plausibility debate ===
[[Type physicalism|Type-identity theorists]] and other skeptics hold the view that consciousness can only be realized in particular physical systems because consciousness has properties that necessarily depend on physical constitution ({{harvnb|Block|1978}}; {{harvnb|Bickle|2003}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schlagel | first1 = R. H. | year = 1999 | title = Why not artificial consciousness or thought? | url = | journal = Minds and Machines | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 3–28 | doi=10.1023/a:1008374714117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Searle | first1 = J. R. | year = 1980 | title = Minds, brains, and programs | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 3 | issue = 3| pages = 417–457 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00005756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article "Artificial Consciousness: Utopia or Real Possibility" Giorgio Buttazzo says that despite our current technology's ability to simulate autonomy, "Working in a fully automated mode, they [the computers] cannot exhibit creativity, emotions, or [[free will]]. A computer, like a washing machine, is a slave operated by its components."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=933500&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F2%2F20203%2F00933500 Artificial consciousness: Utopia or real possibility?] Buttazzo, Giorgio, July 2001, Computer, ISSN 0018-9162&lt;/ref&gt;

For other theorists (e.g., [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalists]]), who define mental states in terms of causal roles, any system that can instantiate the same pattern of causal roles, regardless of physical constitution, will instantiate the same mental states, including consciousness ({{harvnb|Putnam|1967}}).

==== Computational Foundation argument ====
One of the most explicit arguments for the plausibility of AC comes from [[David Chalmers]].  His proposal, found within his article {{harvnb | Chalmers | 2011}}, is roughly that the right kinds of computations are sufficient for the possession of a conscious mind. In the outline, he defends his claim thus: Computers perform computations. Computations can capture other systems' abstract causal organization.

The most controversial part of Chalmers' proposal is that mental properties are "organizationally invariant". Mental properties are of two kinds, psychological and phenomenological. Psychological properties, such as belief and perception, are those that are "characterized by their causal role". He adverts to the work of {{harvnb|Armstrong|1968}} and {{harvnb|Lewis|1972}} in claiming that "[s]ystems with the same causal topology…will share their psychological properties".

Phenomenological properties are not prima facie definable in terms of their causal roles. Establishing that phenomenological properties are amenable to individuation by causal role therefore requires argument. Chalmers provides his Dancing Qualia Argument for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html|title=Absent Qualia, Fading Qualia, Dancing Qualia|accessdate=12 April 2016|date=1995|first=David|last=Chalmers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chalmers begins by assuming that agents with identical causal organizations could have different experiences. He then asks us to conceive of changing one agent into the other by the replacement of parts (neural parts replaced by silicon, say) while preserving its causal organization. Ex hypothesi, the experience of the agent under transformation would change (as the parts were replaced), but there would be no change in causal topology and therefore no means whereby the agent could "notice" the shift in experience.

Critics of AC object that Chalmers begs the question in assuming that all mental properties and external connections are sufficiently captured by abstract causal organization.

=== Ethics ===
{{Main|Ethics of artificial intelligence|Machine ethics|Roboethics}}
If it were suspected that a particular machine was conscious, its rights would be an [[ethics|ethical]] issue that would need to be assessed (e.g. what rights it would have under law). For example, a conscious computer that was owned and used as a tool or central computer of a building or large machine is a particular ambiguity. Should [[law]]s be made for such a case, consciousness would also require a legal definition (for example a machine's ability to experience [[pleasure]] or [[pain]], known as [[sentience]]). Because artificial consciousness is still largely a theoretical subject, such ethics have not been discussed or developed to a great extent, though it has often been a theme in fiction (see below).

The rules for the 2003 [[Loebner Prize]] competition explicitly addressed the question of robot rights:
&lt;blockquote&gt;61. If, in any given year, a publicly available open source Entry entered by the University of Surrey or the Cambridge Center wins the Silver Medal or the Gold Medal, then the Medal and the Cash Award will be awarded to the body responsible for the development of that Entry. If no such body can be identified, or if there is disagreement among two or more claimants, the Medal and the Cash Award will be held in trust ''until such time as the Entry may legally possess, either in the United States of America or in the venue of the contest, the Cash Award and Gold Medal in its own right''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://loebner03.hamill.co.uk/docs/LPC%20Official%20Rules%20v2.0.pdf Loebner Prize Contest Official Rules — Version 2.0] The competition was directed by [[David Hamill]] and the rules were developed by members of the Robitron Yahoo group.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Research and implementation proposals ==

=== Aspects of consciousness ===
There are various aspects of consciousness generally deemed necessary for a machine to be artificially conscious. A variety of functions in which consciousness plays a role were suggested by [[Bernard Baars]] ({{harvnb|Baars|1988}}) and others. The functions of consciousness suggested by Bernard Baars are Definition and Context Setting, Adaptation and Learning, Editing, Flagging and Debugging, Recruiting and Control, Prioritizing and Access-Control, Decision-making or Executive Function, Analogy-forming Function, Metacognitive and Self-monitoring Function, and Autoprogramming and Self-maintenance Function. Igor Aleksander suggested 12 principles for artificial consciousness ({{harvnb|Aleksander|1995}}) and these are: The Brain is a State Machine, Inner Neuron Partitioning, Conscious and Unconscious States, Perceptual Learning and Memory, Prediction, The Awareness of Self, Representation of Meaning, Learning Utterances, Learning Language, Will, Instinct, and Emotion. The aim of AC is to define whether and how these and other aspects of consciousness can be synthesized in an engineered artifact such as a digital computer. This list is not exhaustive; there are many others not covered.

==== Awareness ====
[[Awareness]] could be one required aspect, but there are many problems with the exact definition of ''awareness''. The results of the experiments of [[Mirror neurons#In monkeys|neuroscanning on monkeys]] suggest that a process, not only a state or object, activates neurons. Awareness includes creating and testing alternative models of each process based on the information received through the senses or imagined, and is also useful for making predictions. Such modeling needs a lot of flexibility. Creating such a model includes modeling of the physical world, modeling of one's own internal states and processes, and modeling of other conscious entities.

There are at least three types of awareness:&lt;ref&gt;Joëlle Proust in ''Neural Correlates of Consciousness'', Thomas Metzinger, 2000, MIT, pages 307-324&lt;/ref&gt; agency awareness, goal awareness, and sensorimotor awareness, which may also be conscious or not.  For example, in agency awareness you may be aware that you performed a certain action yesterday, but are not now conscious of it.  In goal awareness you may be aware that you must search for a lost object, but are not now conscious of it.  In sensorimotor awareness, you may be aware that your hand is resting on an object, but are not now conscious of it.

Because objects of awareness are often conscious, the distinction between awareness and consciousness is frequently blurred or they are used as synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;Christof Koch, ''The Quest for Consciousness'', 2004, page 2 footnote 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Memory ====
Conscious events interact with [[memory]] systems in learning, rehearsal, and retrieval.&lt;ref&gt;Tulving, E. 1985. Memory and consciousness. Canadian Psychology 26:1-12&lt;/ref&gt;
The IDA model&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Stan, et al. "The role of consciousness in memory." Brains, Minds and Media 1.1 (2005): 38.&lt;/ref&gt; elucidates the role of consciousness in the updating of perceptual memory,&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Stan. "Perceptual memory and learning: Recognizing, categorizing, and relating." Proc. Developmental Robotics AAAI Spring Symp. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; transient [[episodic memory]], and [[procedural memory]]. Transient episodic and declarative memories have distributed representations in IDA, there is evidence that this is also the case in the nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;Shastri, L. 2002. Episodic memory and cortico-hippocampal interactions. Trends in Cognitive Sciences&lt;/ref&gt; In IDA, these two memories are implemented computationally using a modified version of [[Pentti Kanerva|Kanerva]]’s [[Sparse distributed memory]] architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva, Pentti. Sparse distributed memory. MIT press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Learning ====
Learning is also considered necessary for AC. By Bernard Baars, conscious experience is needed to represent and adapt to novel and significant events ({{harvnb|Baars|1988}}). By [[Axel Cleeremans]] and Luis Jiménez, learning is defined as "a set of philogenetically {{sic}} advanced adaptation processes that critically depend on an evolved sensitivity to subjective experience so as to enable agents to afford flexible control over their actions in complex, unpredictable environments" ({{harvnb|Cleeremans|2001}}).

==== Anticipation ====
The ability to predict (or [[Anticipation (artificial intelligence)|anticipate]]) foreseeable events is considered important for AC by [[Igor Aleksander]].&lt;ref name="Aleksander 1995"&gt;Aleksander 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The emergentist [[Multiple Drafts Model|multiple drafts principle]] proposed by [[Daniel Dennett]] in ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'' may be useful for prediction: it involves the evaluation and selection of the most appropriate "draft" to fit the current environment.  Anticipation includes prediction of consequences of one's own proposed actions and prediction of consequences of probable actions by other entities.

Relationships between real world states are mirrored in the state structure of a conscious organism enabling the organism to predict events.&lt;ref name="Aleksander 1995"/&gt; An artificially conscious machine should be able to anticipate events correctly in order to be ready to respond to them when they occur or to take preemptive action to avert anticipated events. The implication here is that the machine needs flexible, real-time components that build spatial, dynamic, statistical, functional, and cause-effect models of the real world and predicted worlds, making it possible to demonstrate that it possesses artificial consciousness in the present and future and not only in the past. In order to do this, a conscious machine should make coherent predictions and contingency plans, not only in worlds with fixed rules like a chess board, but also for novel environments that may change, to be executed only when appropriate to simulate and control the real world.

==== Subjective experience ====
Subjective experiences or [[qualia]] are widely considered to be ''the'' [[hard problem of consciousness]]. Indeed, it is held to pose a challenge to [[physicalism]], let alone [[computationalism]]. On the other hand, there are problems in other fields of science which limit that which we can observe, such as the [[uncertainty principle]] in physics, which have not made the research in these fields of science impossible.

=== Role of cognitive architectures ===
{{Main|Cognitive architecture}}

The term "cognitive architecture" may refer to a theory about the structure of the human mind, or any portion or function thereof, including consciousness. In another context, a cognitive architecture implements the theory on computers. An example is ''QuBIC: Quantum and Bio-inspired Cognitive Architecture for Machine Consciousness''. One of the main goals of a cognitive architecture is to summarize the various results of cognitive psychology in a comprehensive computer model. However, the results need to be in a formalized form so they can be the basis of a computer program. Also, the role of cognitive architecture is for the A.I. to clearly structure, build, and implement it's thought process.

===Symbolic or hybrid proposals===

====Franklin's Intelligent Distribution Agent====
[[Stan Franklin]] (1995, 2003) defines an [[autonomous agent]] as possessing [[consciousness|functional consciousness]] when it is capable of several of the functions of consciousness as identified by [[Bernard Baars]]' [[Global Workspace Theory]] {{Harvs|last=Baars|year=1988|year2=1997}}. His brain child IDA (Intelligent Distribution Agent) is a software implementation of GWT, which makes it functionally conscious by definition. IDA's task is to negotiate new assignments for sailors in the [[US Navy]] after they end a tour of duty, by matching each individual's skills and preferences with the Navy's needs. IDA interacts with Navy databases and communicates with the sailors via natural language e-mail dialog while obeying a large set of Navy policies. The IDA computational model was developed during 1996–2001 at Stan Franklin's "Conscious" Software Research Group at the [[University of Memphis]]. It "consists of approximately a quarter-million lines of [[Java (programming language)|Java]] code, and almost completely consumes the resources of a 2001 high-end workstation." It relies heavily on ''codelets'', which are "special purpose, relatively independent, mini-agent[s] typically implemented as a small piece of code running as a separate thread." In IDA's top-down architecture, high-level cognitive functions are explicitly modeled (see {{Harvnb|Franklin|1995}} and {{Harvnb|Franklin|2003}} for details). While IDA is functionally conscious by definition, Franklin does "not attribute [[consciousness|phenomenal consciousness]] to his own 'conscious' software agent, IDA, in spite of her many human-like behaviours. This in spite of watching several US Navy detailers repeatedly nodding their heads saying 'Yes, that's how I do it' while watching IDA's internal and external actions as she performs her task."

====Ron Sun's cognitive architecture CLARION====
[[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION]] posits a two-level representation that explains the distinction between conscious and unconscious mental processes.

CLARION has been successful in accounting for a variety of psychological data. A number of well-known skill learning tasks have been simulated using CLARION that span the spectrum ranging from simple reactive skills to complex cognitive skills. The tasks include serial reaction time (SRT) tasks, artificial grammar learning (AGL) tasks, process control (PC) tasks, the categorical inference (CI) task, the alphabetical arithmetic (AA) task, and the Tower of Hanoi (TOH) task {{Harv|Sun|2002}}. Among them, SRT, AGL, and PC are typical implicit learning tasks, very much relevant to the issue of consciousness as they operationalized the notion of consciousness in the context of psychological experiments.

====Ben Goertzel's OpenCog====
[[Ben Goertzel]] is pursuing an embodied AGI through the open-source [[OpenCog]] project. Current code includes embodied virtual pets capable of learning simple English-language commands, as well as integration with real-world robotics, being done at the [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]].

===Connectionist proposals===

====Haikonen's cognitive architecture====
Pentti {{Harvtxt|Haikonen|2003}} considers classical rule-based computing inadequate for achieving AC: "the brain is definitely not a computer. Thinking is not an execution of programmed strings of commands. The brain is not a numerical calculator either. We do not think by numbers." Rather than trying to achieve [[mind]] and [[consciousness]] by identifying and implementing their underlying computational rules, Haikonen proposes "a special [[cognitive architecture]] to reproduce the processes of [[perception]], [[Mental image|inner imagery]], [[Intrapersonal communication|inner speech]], [[pain]], [[pleasure]], [[emotions]] and the [[cognitive]] functions behind these. This bottom-up architecture would produce higher-level functions by the power of the elementary processing units, the [[artificial neuron]]s, without [[algorithms]] or [[computer program|programs]]". Haikonen believes that, when implemented with sufficient complexity, this architecture will develop consciousness, which he considers to be "a style and way of operation, characterized by distributed signal representation, perception process, cross-modality reporting and availability for retrospection." Haikonen is not alone in this process view of consciousness, or the view that AC will spontaneously emerge in [[autonomous agent]]s that have a suitable neuro-inspired architecture of complexity; these are shared by many, e.g. {{Harvtxt|Freeman|1999}} and {{Harvtxt|Cotterill|2003}}. A low-complexity implementation of the architecture proposed by {{Harvtxt|Haikonen|2003}} was reportedly not capable of AC, but did exhibit emotions as expected. See {{Harvtxt|Doan|2009}} for a comprehensive introduction to Haikonen's cognitive architecture. An updated account of Haikonen's architecture, along with a summary of his philosophical views, is given in {{Harvtxt|Haikonen|2012}}.

====Shanahan's cognitive architecture====
[[Murray Shanahan]] describes a cognitive architecture that combines Baars's idea of a global workspace with a mechanism for internal simulation ("imagination") {{Harv|Shanahan|2006}}. For discussions of Shanahan's architecture, see {{Harv|Gamez|2008}} and {{Harv|Reggia|2013}} and Chapter 20 of {{Harv|Haikonen|2012}}.

====Takeno's self-awareness research====
Self-awareness in robots is being investigated by Junichi Takeno&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://robonable.typepad.jp/robot/2_/index.html |title=Robot |accessdate=2007-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703091242/http://robonable.typepad.jp/robot/2_/index.html |archivedate=2007-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Meiji University]] in Japan. Takeno is asserting that he has developed a robot capable of discriminating between a self-image in a mirror and any other having an identical image to it,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rs.cs.meiji.ac.jp/Takeno_Archive.html Takeno - Archive No...]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090203193304/http://www.mimed.mw.tum.de/06-12-18_MIMED_LUETH-002918.PDF The world first self-aware robot and The success of mirror image cognition], Takeno&lt;/ref&gt; and this claim has already been reviewed {{Harv|Takeno|Inaba|Suzuki|2005}}. Takeno asserts that he first contrived the computational module called a MoNAD, which has a self-aware function, and he then constructed the artificial consciousness system by formulating the relationships between emotions, feelings and reason by connecting the modules in a hierarchy (Igarashi, Takeno 2007). Takeno completed a mirror image cognition experiment using a robot equipped with the MoNAD system. Takeno proposed the Self-Body Theory stating that "humans feel that their own mirror image is closer to themselves than an actual part of themselves." The most important point in developing artificial consciousness or clarifying human consciousness is the development of a function of self awareness, and he claims that he has demonstrated physical and mathematical evidence for this in his thesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.s2is.org/Issues/v1/n4/papers/paper4.pdf A Robot Succeeds in 100% Mirror Image Cognition], Takeno, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He also demonstrated that robots can study episodes in memory where the emotions were stimulated and use this experience to take predictive actions to prevent the recurrence of unpleasant emotions (Torigoe, Takeno 2009).

====Aleksander's impossible mind====
[[Igor Aleksander]], emeritus professor of Neural Systems Engineering at [[Imperial College]], has extensively researched [[artificial neural network]]s and claims in his book ''Impossible Minds: My Neurons, My Consciousness'' that the principles for creating a conscious machine already exist but that it would take forty years to train such a machine to understand [[language]].&lt;ref&gt;Aleksander I (1996) ''Impossible Minds: My Neurons, My Consciousness'', Imperial College Press {{ISBN|1-86094-036-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether this is true remains to be demonstrated and the basic principle stated in ''Impossible Minds''—that the brain is a [[finite state machine|neural state machine]]—is open to doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = RJ | year = 1998 | title = review of ''Impossible Minds'' | url = | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 115–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Michael Graziano's attention schema ====
{{Main|Michael Graziano#The brain basis of consciousness}}

In 2011, [[Michael Graziano]] and Sabine Kastler published a paper named "Human consciousness and its relationship to social neuroscience: A novel hypothesis" proposing a theory of consciousness as an attention schema.&lt;ref name="Graziano, A novel hypothesis"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graziano|first1=Michael|title=Human consciousness and its relationship to social neuroscience: A novel hypothesis|journal=Corn Neurosci.|date=1 January 2011|volume=2|issue=2|pages=98–113|pmc=3223025|doi=10.1080/17588928.2011.565121|pmid=22121395}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Graziano went on to publish an expanded discussion of this theory in his book "Consciousness and the Social Brain".&lt;ref name="Graziano Consciousness and the Social Brain"/&gt; This Attention Schema Theory of Consciousness, as he named it, proposes that the brain tracks attention to various sensory inputs by way of  an attention schema, analogous to the well study body schema that tracks the spatial place of a person's body.&lt;ref name="Graziano Consciousness and the Social Brain"/&gt;  This relates to artificial consciousness by proposing a specific mechanism of information handling, that produces what we allegedly experience and describe as consciousness, and which should be able to be duplicated by a machine using current technology. When the brain finds that person X is aware of thing Y, it is in effect modeling the state in which person X is applying an attentional enhancement to Y. In the attention schema theory, the same process can be applied to oneself. The brain tracks attention to various sensory inputs, and one's own awareness is a schematized model of one's attention. Graziano proposes specific locations in the brain for this process, and suggests that such awareness is a computed feature constructed by an expert system in the brain.

== Testing ==
The most well-known method for testing machine [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] is the [[Turing test]]. But when interpreted as only observational, this test contradicts the philosophy of science principles of [[Theory-ladenness|theory dependence of observations]]. It also has been suggested that Alan Turing's recommendation of imitating not a human adult consciousness, but a human child consciousness, should be taken seriously.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~itamar/Papers/AI_MAG_2011.pdf Mapping the Landscape of Human-Level Artificial General Intelligence]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other tests, such as [http://www.conscious-robots.com/consscale ConsScale], test the presence of features inspired by biological systems, or measure the cognitive development of artificial systems.

Qualia, or phenomenological consciousness, is an inherently first-person phenomenon. Although various systems may display various signs of behavior correlated with functional consciousness, there is no conceivable way in which third-person tests can have access to first-person phenomenological features. Because of that, and because there is no empirical definition of consciousness,&lt;ref&gt;"Consciousness". In Honderich T. The Oxford companion to philosophy. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-926479-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; a test of presence of consciousness in AC may be impossible.

In 2014, Victor Argonov suggested a non-Turing test for machine consciousness based on machine's ability to produce philosophical judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Victor Argonov |title=Experimental Methods for Unraveling the Mind-body Problem: The Phenomenal Judgment Approach |journal=Journal of Mind and Behavior |volume=35 |year=2014 | pages=51–70 | url=http://philpapers.org/rec/ARGMAA-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that a deterministic machine must be regarded as conscious if it is able to produce judgments on all problematic properties of consciousness (such as qualia or binding) having no innate (preloaded) philosophical knowledge on these issues, no philosophical discussions while learning, and no informational models of other creatures in its memory (such models may implicitly or explicitly contain knowledge about these creatures’ consciousness). However, this test can be used only to detect, but not refute the existence of consciousness. A positive result proves that machine is conscious but a negative result proves nothing. For example, absence of philosophical judgments may be caused by lack of the machine’s intellect, not by absence of consciousness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6005">The bilingual status of [[Gmina|gminas (municipalities)]] in [[Poland]] is regulated by the ''Act of 6 January 2005 on National and Ethnic Minorities and on the Regional Languages'', which permits certain gminas with significant linguistic minorities to introduce a second, auxiliary language to be used in official contexts alongside [[Polish language|Polish]]. So far 44 gminas have done this:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ksng.gugik.gov.pl/english/files/list_of_minority_names.pdf |title=Map on page of Polish Commission on Standardization of Geographical Names |date= |accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Truncated antenna==
The [[chlorophyll]] (Chl) antenna size in green algae is minimized, or truncated, to maximize photobiological solar conversion efficiency and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. The truncated Chl antenna size minimizes absorption and wasteful dissipation of sunlight by individual cells, resulting in better light utilization efficiency and greater photosynthetic productivity by the green alga mass culture.&lt;ref name="KirstGarcia-Cerdan2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirst|first1=H.|last2=Garcia-Cerdan|first2=J.

==History==
In 1939  [[Hans Gaffron]] observed that the algae he was studying, ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'' (a green-algae), would sometimes switch from the production of oxygen to the production of hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,54456,00.html Algae: Power Plant of the Future?]&lt;/ref&gt; He never discovered the cause of this change and for many years other scientists failed in their attempts to discover it. In the late 1990s, [[Anastasios Melis]] discovered that if the algae culture medium is deprived of sulfur it will switch from the production of oxygen (normal photosynthesis), to the production of hydrogen. He found that the [[enzyme]] responsible for this reaction is [[hydrogenase]], but that the hydrogenase lost this function in the presence of oxygen. Melis found that depleting the amount of sulfur available to the algae interrupted its internal oxygen flow, allowing the hydrogenase an environment in which it can react, causing the algae to produce hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.04/mustread.html?pg=5 Reengineering Algae To Fuel The Hydrogen Economy]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chlamydomonas moewusii]]'' is also a good strain for the production of hydrogen.&lt;ref name="YangGuarnieri2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Shihui|last2=Guarnieri|first2=Michael T|last3=Smolinski|first3=Sharon|last4=Ghirardi|first4=Maria|last5=Pienkos|first5=Philip T|title=De novo transcriptomic analysis of hydrogen production in the green alga Chlamydomonas moewusii through RNA-Seq|journal=Biotechnology for Biofuels|volume=6|issue=1|year=2013|pages=118|issn=1754-6834|doi=10.1186/1754-6834-6-118|pmid=23971877|pmc=3846465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
It would take about 25,000 square kilometre algal farming to produce biohydrogen equivalent to the energy provided by gasoline in the US alone.  This area represents approximately 10% of the area devoted to growing soya in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/energy-fuels/mg18925401.600-growing-hydrogen-for-the-cars-of-tomorrow.html Growing hydrogen for the cars of tomorrow]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bioreactor design issues==
* Restriction of photosynthetic hydrogen production by accumulation of a [[proton gradient]].
* Competitive inhibition of photosynthetic hydrogen production by carbon dioxide.
* Requirement for bicarbonate binding at [[photosystem II]] (PSII) for [[Photosynthetic efficiency|efficient photosynthetic activity]].
* Competitive drainage of electrons by oxygen in algal hydrogen production.
* Economics must reach competitive price to other sources of energy and the economics are dependent on several parameters.
* A major technical obstacle is the efficiency in converting solar energy into chemical energy stored in molecular hydrogen.

Attempts are in progress to solve these problems via [[bioengineering]].

'''Bisection''' is a method used in [[software development]] to identify [[Patch (computing)|change sets]] that result in a specific behavior change. It is mostly employed for finding the patch that introduced a [[software bug|bug]]. Another application area is finding the patch that indirectly fixed a bug.

==Overview==
The process of locating the [[changeset]] that introduced a specific [[software regression|regression]] was described as "source change isolation" in 1997 by Brian Ness and Viet Ngo of [[Cray Research]]. [[Regression testing]] was performed on Cray's [[compiler]]s in editions comprising one or more changesets. Editions with known regressions could not be validated until developers addressed the problem. Source change isolation narrowed the cause to a single changeset that could then be excluded from editions, unblocking them with respect to this problem, while the author of the change worked on a fix. Ness and Ngo outlined [[linear search]] and [[binary search]] methods of performing this isolation.&lt;ref name="Ness 97"&gt;{{cite conference |title=Regression containment through source change isolation |last=Ness |first=Brian |last2=Ngo |first2=Viet |date=1997 |conference=Computer Software and Applications Conference |doi=10.1109/CMPSAC.1997.625082 |publisher=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Code bisection has the goal of minimizing the effort to find a specific change set.
It employs a [[divide and conquer algorithm]] that
depends on having access to the code history which is usually preserved by
[[revision control]] in a [[Repository (version control)|code repository]].

==Bisection method==
===Code bisection algorithm===
Code history has the structure of a [[directed acyclic graph]] which can be [[Topological ordering|topologically sorted]]. This makes it possible to use a divide and conquer search algorithm which:
* splits up the [[Computational geometry#Geometric query problems|search space]] of candidate revisions
* tests for the behavior in question
* reduces the search space depending on the test result
* re-iterates the steps above until a range with at most one bisectable [[Candidate solution|patch candidate]] remains

===Algorithmic complexity===
Bisection is in [[L (complexity)|LSPACE]] having an [[Analysis of algorithms|algorithmic complexity]] of &lt;math&gt;O(\log N)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; denoting the number of revisions in the search space, and is similar to a [[binary search]].

===Desirable repository properties===
For code bisection it is desirable that each revision in the search space can be built and tested independently.

==Automation support==
Although the bisection method can be completed manually, one of its main advantages is that it can be easily automated.&lt;ref name="Ness 97" /&gt; It can thus fit into existing [[test automation]] processes: failures in exhaustive automated regression tests can trigger automated bisection to localize faults. Ness and Ngo focused on its potential in Cray's [[continuous delivery]]-style environment in which the automatically-isolated bad changeset could be automatically excluded from builds.&lt;ref name="Zeller 99"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Andreas |last=Zeller |title=Yesterday, my program worked. Today, it does not. Why? |date=1999 |conference=European Software Engineering Conference |location=Toulouse, France |doi=10.1145/318774.318946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revision control systems [[Git (software)|Git]] and [[Mercurial]] have built-in functionality for code bisection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect |title=git-bisect(1) |website=git-scm.com |accessdate=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.selenic.com/mercurial/hg.1.html#bisect |title=hg |website=Selenic.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The user can start a bisection session with a specified range of revisions from which the revision control system proposes a revision to test, the user tells the system whether the revision tested as "good" or "bad", and the process repeats until the specific "bad" revision has been identified. Other revision control systems, such as [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]] or [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]], support bisection through plugins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/plugins/en/bisect-plugin.html |title=bisect - Find the revision introducing a bug using a binary search — Bazaar 2.8.0dev1 documentation |website=Doc.bazaar.canonical.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; or external scripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://metacpan.org/module/INFINOID/App-SVN-Bisect-1.1/bin/svn-bisect |title=svn-bisect |website=Metacpan.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phoronix Test Suite]] can do bisection automatically to find performance regressions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6080">In [[mathematics]], a '''bundle''' is a generalization of a [[fiber bundle]] dropping the condition of a local product structure. The requirement of a local product structure rests on the bundle having a [[topological space|topology]]. Without this requirement, more general objects can be considered bundles. For example, one can consider a bundle π: ''E''→ ''B'' with ''E'' and ''B'' [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]. It is no longer true that the [[preimage]]s &lt;math&gt;\pi^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt; must all look alike, unlike fiber bundles where the fibers must all be [[isomorphic]] (in the case of [[vector bundle]]s) and [[homeomorphic]].

== Definition ==
A bundle is a triple {{math|(''E'', ''p'', ''B'')}} where {{math|''E'', ''B''}} are sets and {{math|''p'':''E''→''B''}} a map.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Husemoller|1994}} p 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{math|''E''}} is called the '''total space'''
*{{math|''B''}} is the '''base space''' of the bundle
*{{math|''p''}} is the '''projection'''

This definition of a bundle is quite unrestrictive. For instance, the [[empty function]] defines a bundle. Nonetheless it serves well to introduce the basic terminology, and every type of bundle has the basic ingredients of above with restrictions on {{math|''E'', ''p'', ''B''}} and usually there is additional structure.

For each {{math|''b'' ∈ ''B'', ''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''b'')}} is the '''fibre''' or '''fiber''' of the bundle over {{math|''b''}}.

A bundle {{math|(''E*'', ''p*'', ''B*'')}} is a '''subbundle''' of {{math|(''E'', ''p'', ''B'')}} if {{math|''B*'' ⊂ ''B'', ''E*'' ⊂ ''E''}} and {{math|''p*'' {{=}} ''p''{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;''E*''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

A [[Section (fibre bundle)|cross section]] is a map {{math|''s'':''B'' → ''E''}} such that {{math|''p''(''s''(''b'')) {{=}} ''b''}} for each {{math|''b'' ∈ ''B''}}, that is, {{math|''s''(''b'') ∈ ''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''b'')}}.

== Examples ==
*If {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''B''}} are [[smooth manifold]]s and {{math|''p''}} is smooth, [[Surjective function|surjective]] and in addition a [[Submersion (mathematics)|submersion]], then the bundle is a [[fibered manifold]]. Here and in the following examples, the smoothness condition may be weakened to continuous or sharpened to analytic, or it could be anything reasonable, like continuously differentiable ({{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}), in between.
*If for each two points {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the base, the corresponding fibers {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are [[homotopy equivalent]], then the bundle is a [[fibration]].
*If for each two points {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the base, the corresponding fibers {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are [[homeomorphic]], and in addition the bundle satisfies certain conditions of ''local triviality'' outlined in the pertaining linked articles, then the bundle is a [[fiber bundle]]. Usually there is additional structure , e.g. a [[group structure]] or a [[Vector space#Definition|vector space structure]], on the fibers besides a topology. Then is required that the homeomorphism is an isomorphism with respect to that structure, and the conditions of local triviality are sharpened accordingly.
*A [[principal bundle]] is a fiber bundle endowed with a right [[group action]] with certain properties. One example of a principal bundle is the [[frame bundle]].
*If for each two points {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the base, the corresponding fibers {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are [[vector space]]s of the same dimension, then the bundle is a [[vector bundle]] if the appropriate conditions of local triviality are satisfied. The [[tangent bundle]] is an example of a vector bundle.

==Bundle objects==
More generally, bundles or '''bundle objects''' can be defined in any [[category (mathematics)|category]]: in a category '''C''', a bundle is simply an [[epimorphism]] π: ''E'' → ''B''.  If the category is not [[concrete category|concrete]], then the notion of a preimage of the map is not necessarily available. Therefore these bundles may have no fibers at all, although for sufficiently well behaved categories they do; for instance, for a category with [[pullback (category theory)|pullbacks]] and a [[initial object|terminal object]] 1 the points of ''B'' can be identified with morphisms ''p'':1→''B'' and the fiber of ''p'' is obtained as the pullback of ''p'' and π. The category of bundles over ''B'' is a subcategory of the [[slice category]] ('''C'''↓''B'') of objects over ''B'', while the category of bundles without fixed base object is a subcategory of the [[comma category]] (''C''↓''C'') which is also the [[functor category]] '''C'''², the category of [[morphism]]s in '''C'''.

The category of smooth vector bundles is a bundle object over the category of smooth manifolds in '''Cat''', the [[category of small categories]].  The [[functor]] taking each manifold to its [[tangent bundle]] is an example of a section of this bundle object.

{{redirect|Castle law|the hill in Scotland|Castle Law}}
A '''castle doctrine''', also known as a '''castle law''' or a '''defense of habitation law''', is a legal doctrine that designates a person's abode or any legally occupied place (for example, a vehicle or home) as a place in which that person has protections and immunities permitting one, in certain circumstances, to use force (up to and including [[deadly force]]) to defend oneself against an intruder, free from legal prosecution for the consequences of the force used.&lt;ref name=njsd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2008/Bills/A0500/159_I1.PDF|title=Assembly, No. 159, State of New Jersey, 213th Legislature, The "New Jersey Self Defense Law"| date= May 6, 2008| quote=The "Castle Doctrine" is a long-standing American legal concept arising from English Common Law that provides that one's abode is a special area in which one enjoys certain protections and immunities, that one is not obligated to retreat before defending oneself against attack, and that one may do so without fear of prosecution. |accessdate=2009-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most commonly used in the [[United States]], though many other countries{{which|date=November 2017}} invoke comparable principles in their laws.

A person may have a [[duty to retreat]] to avoid violence if one can reasonably do so. Castle doctrines lessen the duty to retreat when an individual is assaulted within one's own home. Deadly force may either be [[justifiable homicide|justified]], the [[Prima facie|burdens of production]] and [[Burden of proof (law)|proof]] for charges impeded, or an [[affirmative defense]] against [[criminal homicide]] applicable, in cases "when the actor reasonably fears [[imminent peril]] of death or serious bodily harm to him or herself or another".&lt;ref name=njsd/&gt; The castle doctrine is not a defined law that can be invoked, but a set of principles which may be incorporated in some form in many jurisdictions. Castle doctrines may not provide civil immunity, such as from [[wrongful death]] suits, which have a much lower [[Burden of proof (law)|burden of proof]].

Justifiable homicide&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelawdictionary.org/homicide-justifiable/#ixzz2aUEbR0HM Black's Law Dictionary]: This term applies to the blameless killing of a person, such as in self-defense.&lt;/ref&gt; in self-defense which happens to occur inside one's home is distinct, as [[question of law|a matter of law]], from castle doctrine because the mere occurrence of [[trespassing]]—and occasionally a [[Subjectivity|subjective]] requirement of fear—is sufficient to invoke the castle doctrine, the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] of [[Fact (law)|fact]] is much less challenging than that of justifying a homicide in self-defense. With justifiable homicide in self-defense, one generally must [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectively]] prove to a [[trier of fact]], against [[Legal burden of proof#Beyond reasonable doubt|all reasonable doubt]], the [[Intent (law)|intent]] in the intruder's mind to commit [[violence]] or a [[felony]]. It would be a misconception of law to infer that because a state has a justifiable homicide in self-defense provision pertaining to one's [[Domicile (law)|domicile]], it has a castle doctrine protecting the estate and exonerating any duty whatsoever to retreat therefrom. The doctrine can be misused as a [[pretext]] for [[extrajudicial punishment]] in private spaces. The use of this legal principle in the United States has been controversial in relation to a number of cases in which it has been invoked, including the deaths of Japanese exchange student [[Yoshihiro Hattori]] and Scottish businessman [[Andrew de Vries]].

==History==
The legal concept of the inviolability of the home has been known in [[Western civilization]] since the age of the [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges]], ''The Ancient City'', 50. "To enter this house with any malevolent intention was a sacrilege. The domicile was inviolable."&lt;/ref&gt; In [[English common law]] the term is derived from the dictum that "'''an Englishman's home is his castle'''" (see ''[[Semayne's case]]''). This concept was established as English law by the 17th century jurist [[Sir Edward Coke]], in his ''The Institutes of the Laws of England'', 1628:&lt;ref name="phrases1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/an-englishmans-home-is-his-castle.html |title=An Englishman's home is his castle |publisher=Phrases.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For a man's house is his castle, et domus sua cuique est tutissimum refugium [and each man's home is his safest refuge].&lt;ref name="phrases1"/&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

English common law came with colonists to the New World, where it has become known as the castle doctrine.&lt;ref name="phrases1"/&gt; The term has been used in England to imply a person's absolute right to exclude anyone from their home, although this has always had restrictions, such as [[bailiff]]s having increasing powers of entry since the late-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Philip Johnston |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/philipjohnston/4218091/An-Englishmans-home-is-no-longer-his-castle.html |title=An Englishman's home is no longer his castle |publisher=Telegraph |date= 11 January 2009|accessdate=2012-01-11 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 18th-century Presbyterian minister and biblical commentator [[Matthew Henry]], the prohibition of murder found in the [[Old Testament]] contains an exception for legitimate self-defense.  A home defender who struck and killed a thief caught in the act of breaking in at night was not guilty of bloodshed.  "If a thief is caught breaking in and is struck so that he dies, the thief owes no blood-debt to the home-defender; but if the thief lives, he owes a blood-debt to the home-defender and must make restitution."&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:2-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0222.htm|title=Exodus 22 / Hebrew - English Bible / Mechon-Mamre|website=www.mechon-mamre.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the early United States ===
[[File:Auction-storage-no-trespassing-sign-tn1.jpg|thumbnail|"Trespassers will be shot" sign]]

By the 18th century, many US state legal systems began by importing English common law such as Acts of Parliament of 2 Ed. III ([[Statute of Northampton]]), and 5 Rich. II ([[Forcible Entry Act 1381]]) in law since 1381—which imposed criminal sanctions intending to discourage the resort to self-help.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/CACourts/ ''Dickinson v. Maguire,'' 9 Cal. 46],  The [[Chief Justice of California]] during the ruling was [[David S. Terry]], who ironically, was later killed by order of [[Stephen Johnson Field|
Associate Supreme Court Justice Field]] under the guise of self-defense.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/daluiso-v-boone-27416 Daluiso v. Boone, 71 Cal.2d 484] for English common law history&lt;/ref&gt; This required a threatened party to retreat, whenever property was "involved" and resolve the issue by civil means.

Then as now, there were English politicians who were for or against the use of self-help over state-help. [[William Blackstone]], in Book 4, Chapter 16&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch16.htm Blackstone's Commentaries - Book the Fourth - Chapter the Sixteenth : Of Offenses Against the Habitations of Individuals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503193949/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch16.htm |date=2008-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of his ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Some doctrines would be hotly debated as law as applied in the young post-revolution United States. Example: "That the King can do no wrong, is a necessary and fundamental principle of the English constitution."&lt;/ref&gt; proclaims that the laws "leave him (the inhabitant) the natural right of killing the aggressor (the burglar)" and goes on to generalize in the following words:

{{quote|text=And the law of England has so particular and tender a regard to the immunity of a man's house, that it stiles it his castle, and will never suffer it to be violated with immunity: agreeing herein with the sentiments of ancient Rome, as expressed in the works of Tully;&lt;ref&gt;"Tully" was once a common abbreviation for Marcus Tullius [[Cicero]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''quid enim sanctius, quid omni religione munitius, quam domus uniusquisque civium?''&lt;ref&gt;''What is more sacred, what more strongly guarded by every holy feeling, than a man's own home?''&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason no doors can in general be broken open to execute any civil process; though, in criminal causes, the public safety supersedes the private. Hence also in part arises the [[animadversion]] of the law upon eaves-droppers, nuisancers, and incendiaries: and to this principle it must be assigned, that a man may assemble people together lawfully without danger of raising a riot, rout, or unlawful assembly, in order to protect and defend his house; which he is not permitted to do in any other case.|sign=[[William Blackstone]] |source=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]}}

Not only was the doctrine considered to justify defense against neighbors and criminals, but any of the Crown's agents who attempted to enter without a proper warrant as well. It should be noted that prohibitions of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] share a common background with current castle doctrine laws.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In 1841, The [[Preemption Act]] was passed to "appropriate the proceeds of the sales of public lands... and to grant 'pre-emption rights' to individuals" who were already living on federal lands (commonly referred to as "[[Squatting in the United States|squatters]]"). During this same period, [[claim club]]s sprung up all over the US advocating [[Alertness|vigilance]] and the castle doctrine. This was in concurrence with the culture of [[manifest destiny]] which led to [[westward expansion]] and the [[American Indian Wars]], the last of which ended by the [[Battle of Bear Valley|1920s]].

=== On the American frontier===
On the [[American frontier]], the doctrine of no duty to retreat extended outside a residence. It asserted that a man in an altercation that he did not provoke was not obliged to flee from his attacker, but was free to stand his ground and defend himself. A state Supreme Court justice wrote in 1877,&lt;ref name=jay2006&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jay|first1=Roger|title=Spitting Lead in Leadville: Doc Holliday's Last Stand |url=http://www.historynet.com/spitting-lead-in-leadville-doc-hollidays-last-stand.htm|website=HistoryNet|publisher=Wild West Magazine|accessdate=13 April 2015|date=August 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Indeed, the tendency of the American mind seems to be very strongly against the enforcement of any rule which requires a person to flee when assailed.}}

American West historian Richard M. Brown wrote that under the circumstances, for a man in the American West to flee under such circumstances would be cowardly and un-American. 
Legendary dentist and gambler [[Doc Holliday]] successfully used this defense when he shot Billy Allen as he entered a saloon. Holliday owed Allen $5 which Allen wanted paid and had threatened Holliday. Although Allen was unarmed at the time, Holliday had received reports that Allen had been armed and looking for him earlier in the day. During the subsequent trial, Holliday asserted he was within his rights and the jury agreed. He was acquitted on March 28, 1885.&lt;ref name=jay2006/&gt;

=== Current position ===
Today, the penal and civil forcible-entry laws of most American states forbid the use of force in the recovery of possession of land.&lt;ref name="forbidden force"&gt;1 Harper and James, op.cit. supra, at § 3.15, p. 258; Prosser, Law of Torts (3d ed. 1964) § 23, p. 125.

Each jurisdiction incorporates the castle doctrine into its laws in different ways. The circumstance in which it may be invoked include the premises covered (abode only, or other places too), the degree of retreat or non-deadly resistance required before deadly force can be used, etc. Typical conditions that apply to some castle doctrine laws include:{{Citation needed|date=January 2012|reason=for each of these points}}

* An intruder must be making (or have made) an attempt to unlawfully or forcibly enter an occupied residence, business, or vehicle.
* The intruder must be acting unlawfully (the castle doctrine does not allow a right to use force against officers of the law, acting in the course of their legal duties).
* The occupant(s) of the home must reasonably believe the intruder intends to inflict serious bodily harm or death upon an occupant of the home. Some states apply the Castle Doctrine if the occupant(s) of the home reasonably believe the intruder intends to commit a lesser felony such as arson or burglary.
* The occupant(s) of the home must not have provoked or instigated an intrusion; or, provoked/instigated an intruder's threat or use of deadly force.  In all cases, the occupant(s) of the home: must be there legally; must not be fugitives from the law, themselves, or aiding/abetting other fugitives; and must not use force upon an officer of the law performing a legal duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reinhart|first1=Christopher|title=CASTLE DOCTRINE AND SELF-DEFENSE|url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/2007/rpt/2007-r-0052.htm|website=www.cga.ct.gov|publisher=State of Connecticut|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Colorado, the make-my-day statute provides the occupant with immunity from prosecution only for force used against a person who has made an unlawful entry into the dwelling, but not against a person who remains unlawfully in the dwelling.&lt;ref&gt;People v. Drennon, 860 P.2d 589 (Colo. Ct. App. 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="People v. McNeese 1995"&gt;People v. McNeese, 892 P.2d 304 (Colo. 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immunity from civil lawsuit===
In addition to providing a valid defense in criminal law, many laws implementing the castle doctrine, particularly those with a "stand-your-ground clause," also have a clause which provides immunity from any ''civil'' lawsuits filed on behalf of the assailant (for damages/injuries resulting from the force used to stop them). Without this clause, an assailant could sue for medical bills, property damage, disability, and pain &amp; suffering as a result of the injuries inflicted by the defender; or, if the force results in the assailant's death, his/her next-of-kin or estate could launch a [[wrongful death]] suit. Even if successfully rebutted, the defendant (the homeowner/defender) may still have to pay high legal costs leading up to the suit's dismissal.  Without criminal/civil immunity, such civil action could be used as revenge against a lawfully acting defender (who was, originally, the assailant's victim).

Use of force in self-defense which causes damage or injuries to other, non-criminally-acting parties, may not be shielded from criminal or civil prosecution, however.

===Duty to retreat===
In US jurisdictions where the castle doctrine applies, there is no [[duty to retreat]] before deadly force is used against an intruder by a person in their home or, in some jurisdictions, just simply where the person can legally be.&lt;ref name=2007-R-0052&gt;Rhinehart, C, [http://www.cga.ct.gov/2007/rpt/2007-R-0052.htm Castle Doctrine and Self-Defense] Connecticut General Assembly, Office of Legislative Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stand-your-ground===
{{main|Stand-your-ground law}}
Most states in the United States have stand-your-ground laws where individuals can use deadly force in any location one is legally allowed to be without first attempting to retreat.

===Culpability of intruder===
In Colorado, the make-my-day statute "was not intended to justify use of physical force against persons who enter a dwelling accidentally or in good faith."&lt;ref name="People v. McNeese 1995"/&gt; In other words, "the unlawful entry element requires a culpable mental state of 'knowingly' on the part of the intruder."&lt;ref&gt;People v. Zukowski, 260 P.3d 339 (Colo. Ct. App. 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

A list of states and their most applicable body of law to justifying homicide in protection of the abode is listed below. Because not all states truly invoke castle doctrine, [[justifiable homicide |justifiable homicide in defense of life]]—which is nearly universal in adoption, but with narrower application—is often what is invoked as a [[pretext]] to protect the home. However, the mere fact that one is trespassing is an inappropriate or inadequate defense [[per se (terminology)|per se]] to justifying homicide in many states.&lt;ref name="forbidden force"/&gt;

===States incorporating castle doctrine principles===
The castle doctrine in its traditional absolute and [[extrajudicial]] form is antiquated in most states. However, its vestige saliently remains as a set of principles which are incorporated to a variegated extent through both [[statutory law|statutory]] and [[case law]]. It is commonly manifested as an [[affirmative defense]] to criminal homicide that occurred within a home;&lt;ref name=Randall/&gt; in some states though it slightly enhances the conditions for justifiable homicide in self-defense by laying down no duty to retreat or avert a violent encounter, or by even granting a blanket rebuttable [[presumption]] of required killing in defense of life. Where principles are statutized in a [[penal code]], a homicide may be excused criminally, but be a [[wrongful death]] civilly. In a strict sense, simple [[justifiable homicide]] in self-defense which happens to occur inside one's home is actually distinct as a  matter of law from castle doctrine's no duty to retreat in defense of one's domicile. Self-defense protects life while castle doctrine defends estate. While most American states forbid the use of force in the recovery of possession of land,&lt;ref name="forbidden force"/&gt; a minority of jurisdictions do invoke pure castle doctrine which unconditionally authorizes violent self-help in protection of one's domicile. States still espousing the archaic form tend to be conservative, or have unique issues such as a primarily rural population in a harsh or adverse environment which critically demands high broad skill in self-reliance. It is invoked in areas often associated with small local governments and very long response times from law enforcement. Dense urban jurisdictions repeatedly find that injustices, mistakes, and avoidable escalation from violent self-help often outweigh any benefit, especially when potential occurrences are frequent, initial police response is usually less than 7–15 minutes away, and legal remedies are local.

(a) A person is justified in using force, except deadly force, against another when and to the extent that the person reasonably believes that the conduct is necessary to defend himself or herself or another against the other's imminent use of unlawful force. However, a person is justified in the use of deadly force and does not have a duty to retreat in any place he or she has the lawful right to be if either of the following applies:

Also, deadly force is permitted in defense of property when used by an individual in possession or control of a dwelling, place of work, or an occupied motor home or travel trailer, or by an individual who is licensed or privileged to be there, if the force is necessary to prevent commission of arson, burglary, robbery, or a felony involving violence upon or in the dwelling, place of work, or occupied motor home or travel trailer, and the use of force other than deadly force for these purposes would expose any individual to substantial danger of serious bodily injury.

Chapter 5 § 505] || The most recent version of Pennsylvania's Castle Doctrine legislation was signed into law in June 2011.  The law extends the right to self-defense up to and including deadly force in a victim's dwelling (now including any attached porch, deck or patio), occupied vehicle, or any other dwelling or vehicle that the victim legally occupies.  A place of work is included in the "castle" provision under certain circumstances.  Use of deadly force is justifiable if the "castle" area in the event that an assailant is "unlawfully and forcefully entering" or has entered the "castle" area.  Deadly force is also justifiable, subject to certain provisions, if a person that legally enters the "castle" goes on to unlawfully attack a victim (when the victim is resonably in fear of his/her life) or if the attacker attempts to kidnap anyone who legally occupies the "castle".    The victim must be in "legal possession" of a firearm or other weapon to be justified in the use of that weapon.  Use of deadly force to protect an innocent third person is generally allowed in circumstances where the provisions for justifiable self-defense are met.  Victims who justifiably use force to defend themselves under the provisions of the law are immune from civil liability for any injuries sustained by the attacker during the incident. The new legislation also contains a stand your ground provision when outside the "castle".  Outside "castle areas" there is no duty to retreat if confronted with a weapon.

-
Legitimate Defense.
A person does not incur criminal liability when defending his person, his home, his property or
rights, or person, dwelling, property or rights of others when the person reasonably believes that imminent damage is to be expected,
provided that there is a rational need for the means of impeding or repelling the damage, and it can be shown that there isn't sufficient evidence
that the person exercising the defense provoked the aggressor, and that the means of exercising the defense did not exceed the means necessary to
repel or avoid the damage.

When self-defense is claimed to justify killing a human being, it is necessary to have founded grounds to believe that by killing the
aggressor, the victim of the aggression or the person being defended from the aggressor was in imminent or immediate danger of death or serious
bodily harm. To justify the defense of the abode, the circumstances must indicate an illegal entry or that the person in the dwelling had a reasonable
belief that a crime will be committed. To justify the defense of property or rights, the circumstances must indicate an attack on them
which results in a criminal offense or puts them in serious danger of imminent deterioration or loss.

A new law passed in April 2018 expanded castle doctrine protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.primerahora.com/noticias/gobierno-politica/nota/defensoresdelasarmascelebrannuevaleydedoctrinadelcastillo-1278342/|title=Defensores de las armas celebran nueva ley de doctrina del castillo|date=2018-04-18|work=Primera Hora|access-date=2018-08-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===States with weak or no specific castle law===
These states uphold castle doctrine in general, but may rely on case law instead of specific legislation, may enforce a duty to retreat, and may impose specific restrictions on the use of deadly force:
*District of Columbia
*Nebraska - a bill was introduced in January 2012 that allowed deadly force against a person who broke into a house or occupied vehicle or who tried to kidnap someone from a house or vehicle; however, the bill was revised to include only an [[affirmative defense]] from lawsuits pertaining to justifiable use of force.&lt;ref name="neb bill cut up"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.southwestiowanews.com/council_bluffs/news/around_the_region/article_2148734e-79b4-11e1-b16e-001a4bcf887a.html |title=150 at rally over death of Florida teen|work=The Daily Nonpariel|date= March 29, 2012|author=Moring, Rosann|accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=28-1409|title=Nebraska Legislature|last=LTC|website=nebraskalegislature.gov|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*New Mexico - Limited Castle Doctrine for self-defense inside one's home established by court precedence in ''State v. Couch'' (1946).  No civil immunity from potential lawsuits by the aggressor or surviving relatives.  In 2011, two bills (House Bill 228 and Senate Bill 29) would have granted civil immunity to individuals who lawfully use lethal force in self-defense, both bills died in their respective chambers of the [[New Mexico Legislature]].
*South Dakota - "Homicide is justifiable if committed by any person while resisting any attempt to murder such person, or to commit any felony upon him or her, or upon or in any dwelling house in which such person is."

==Outside the US==

===Australia===

Australian states have differing [[Self-defence (Australia)|self-defence laws]]. Under South Australian law, the general defence appears in s15(1) Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) for defending a person's life, and s15A(1) for defending property, subject to a hybrid test, i.e. the defendant honestly believed the threat to be imminent and made an objectively reasonable and proportionate response to the circumstances as the accused subjectively perceived them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Law Consolidation (Self Defence) Amendment Act 2003|url=http://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/V/A/2003/CRIMINAL%20LAW%20CONSOLIDATION%20%28SELF%20DEFENCE%29%20AMENDMENT%20ACT%202003_28/2003.28.UN.PDF|publisher=Government of South Australia|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2003, the Rann Government (SA) introduced laws allowing householders to use "whatever force they deem necessary" when confronted with a home invader. Householders who kill or injure a home invader escape prosecution provided they can prove they had a genuine belief that it was necessary to do so to protect themselves or their family. The law was strongly opposed by then-Director of Public Prosecutions Paul Rofe, QC, and lawyer Marie Shaw, who is now a District Court Judge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,21134744-2682,00.html Accused to argue self defence | adelaidenow].

=== Brazil (self-defence of possession) ===
Since 1917, with the enacting of the first Brazilian Civil Code, a possessor of a thing, moveable or immoveable, is allowed, in case of disturbance ("turbação") or expulsion ("esbulho"), to "maintain or to reintegrate himself [at the possession of a thing] using its own force, as well as he does it soon". The acts of force employed by the possessor shall not exceed the necessary ones for eliminating the disturbance or for reintegration (Article 502 of the former Civil Code; Federal Ordinary Law 3.071/1917).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/Ccivil_03/leis/L3071impressao.htm|title=L3071impressao|website=www.planalto.gov.br|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This possibility remained untouched on the Brazilian Civil Code of 2002 (Federal Ordinary Law 10.406/2002), in its Article 1.210.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/CCivil_03/leis/2002/L10406.htm|title=L10406|website=www.planalto.gov.br|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-defence of possession is not allowed for the cases of threat ("ameaça"). It is needed for the possessor to be effectively and physically disturbed in its possession ("turbação") or completely severed from it ("esbulho"). A possessor acting under the prescriptions of the Article 1.210 of the Civil Code shall be exempt of any civil or criminal responsibility. In terms of Tort Law, Article 188, inc. I, of the Civil Code states that is not an unlawful act "the regular exercise of a right recognized by the law".

===Canada===

According to the Criminal Code of Canada Sections 34 and 35,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-6.html#h-9|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Criminal Code|first=Legislative Services|last=Branch|website=lois-laws.justice.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which were updated in 2012 with the passage of bill C-26) force, up to and including lethal force may be used in defence of one's life or "peaceably" possessed property or the defence of another's life or "peaceably" possessed property, and is not considered an offence so long as the person believes that force is being used against them in the case of self-defence, that someone is about to or has broken into or damaged property in the case of defence of property, that they are acting in defence of themselves, someone else or "peaceably" possessed property, and that the act is reasonable in the circumstances. The criminal code also lays out the factors in either case that will be used to determine what constitutes "reasonable given the circumstances". The changes made by the government were to clarify the laws involving self-defence and defence of property, and to help legal professionals to apply the law as believed to reflect the values Canadians hold to be acceptable.

===England and Wales===
[[File:Stable, at Frog's Meadow - geograph.org.uk - 1028887.jpg|thumbnail|"Trespassers will be shot" sign in England]]

In [[Common law|English common law]] a defendant may seek to avoid criminal or civil liability by claiming that he acted in [[Self-defence in English law|self-defence]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|title=CPS Guidance on Self-defence|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/self_defence/#Retreating|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires the jury to determine whether the defendant believed that force was necessary to defend him or herself, his or her property, or to prevent a crime, and that the force used was reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPS Guidelines on Self-Defence|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/self_defence/#Reasonable_Force|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no duty to retreat from an attacker and failure to do so is not conclusive evidence that a person did not act in self-defence, it may still be considered by the jury as a relevant factor when assessing the merits of a self-defence claim.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The [[common law]] [[duty to retreat]] was repealed by the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]]. This duty never existed when a person is somewhere he has a lawful right to be, but due to the repeal, now extends to public places, etc.

===Germany===

German law allows self-defense against an unlawful attack, without any duty to retreat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notwehrparagraph|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p0165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courts have interpreted this law as applicable to home invasion, including the use of lethal force against law enforcement in cases where the home owner was of the mistaken belief that the intrusion was an unlawful attack on his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=	BGH, 02.11.2011 - 2 StR 375/11|url=http://dejure.org/dienste/vernetzung/rechtsprechung?Gericht=BGH&amp;Datum=02.11.2011&amp;Aktenzeichen=2%20StR%20375/11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
Under the terms of the Defence and the Dwelling Act enacted in 2011, property owners or residents are entitled to defend themselves with force, up to and including lethal force.  Any individual who uses force against a trespasser is not guilty of an offense if he or she honestly believes they were there to commit a criminal act and a threat to life. However, there is a further provision which requires that the reaction to the intruder is such that another reasonable person in the same circumstances would likely employ.  This provision acts as a safeguard against grossly disproportionate use of force, while still allowing a person to use force in nearly all circumstances.

The law was introduced in response to [[Death of John Ward|DPP v. Padraig Nally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/0113/1224310196472.html | work=The Irish Times | first=Paul | last=Cullen | title=Law lets householders use reasonable force | date=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0113/home.html |work=RTÉ News |title=Law allows 'reasonable force' defending home |date=13 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115020924/http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0113/home.html |archivedate=15 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act largely places previous Irish common law jurisprudence regarding self-defense on a statutory footing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrights.ie/index.php/2010/07/20/the-criminal-law-defence-and-the-dwelling-bill-2010/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408060648/http://www.humanrights.ie/index.php/2010/07/20/the-criminal-law-defence-and-the-dwelling-bill-2010/|title=The Criminal Law (Defence and the Dwelling) Bill 2010|work=Human Rights in Ireland|archivedate=8 April 2011|publisher=|date=2010-07-20|first=Sinead|last=Ring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corrective rape''', also called '''curative'''&lt;ref name="UNreport2011"/&gt; or '''homophobic rape''',&lt;ref name="UNAIDS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RASmith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MDSmith"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=Merril D.

The common intended consequence of the rape, as seen by the perpetrator, is to turn the person [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] or to enforce conformity with [[gender stereotypes]].&lt;ref name="Bartle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="academia.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/9634350/Corrective_Rape_of_black_lesbian_women_in_Post-Apartheid_South_Africa_investigating_the_symbolic_violence_and_resulting_misappropriation_of_symbolic_power_that_ensues_within_a_nexus_of_social_imaginaries|title=Corrective Rape of black lesbian women in Post-Apartheid South Africa: investigating the symbolic violence and resulting misappropriation of symbolic power that ensues within a nexus of social imaginaries.|publisher=A Night of Dostoevskian Smiles and Sadean excesses|author=Fadi Baghdadi|date=June 28, 2013|via=academia.edu|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Diversity and Social Justice|last=Thompson|first=Sherwood|publisher=Roman &amp; Littlefield|year=2014|isbn=1442216042|volume=1|location=Lanham, MD|page=475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''corrective rape'' was coined in South Africa after well-known cases of corrective rapes of [[lesbian]]s such as [[Eudy Simelane]] (who was also murdered in the same attack) and Zoliswa Nkonyana became public. Popularisation of the term has raised awareness and encouraged [[LGBT]]+ people in countries across the world to come forward with their own stories of being raped as punishment for and/or in an attempt to change their sexual orientation and/or gender identity.&lt;ref name="Denton"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Denton |first=Michelle |date=2017 |title=Rape Culture: How Can We End It? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nn5mDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31 |location=New York |publisher=Greenhaven Publishing LLC |page=31 |isbn=9781534562929 |accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some countries have laws protecting LGBT+ people, corrective rape is often overlooked.&lt;ref name="Hawthorne" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt;

== Definitions==
Corrective rape is the use of [[rape]] against people who do not conform to perceived [[Norm (social)|social norms]] regarding [[human sexuality]] or [[gender role]]s. The goal is to punish perceived abnormal behavior and reinforce societal norms.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt; The crime was first{{when|date=September 2018 |reason=Which year?}} identified in South Africa,&lt;ref name="Janoff" /&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2018}} where it is sometimes supervised by members of the woman's family or local community.&lt;ref name="Bartle" /&gt; One of the earliest known mentions of the term is by South African feminist activist Bernedette Muthien during an August 2001 interview  by [[Human Rights Watch]] in [[Cape Town]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Long |first1=Scott |last2=Brown |first2=A. Widney |last3=Cooper |first3=Gail |date=2003 |title=More Than a Name: State-sponsored Homophobia and Its Consequences in Southern Africa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CZhEqsNtNS4C&amp;pg=PA193 |location= |publisher=Human Rights Watch |page=193 |isbn=9781564322869 |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lesbians are particularly targeted for gang rape. African lesbians are more likely to be raped as lesbians in the townships. To what extent are coloured lesbians also targeted for rape because of their sexual orientation? There are no statistics for this, I don't know what percent of coloured lesbians are targeted for corrective rape action. Growing up, I never heard that lesbians were targeted in this way and so I want to know when that started happening. Gangsterism has always existed in the townships, so you can't attribute it to that. I don't know why black lesbians are targeted more, either. I'd like to know how many women are being raped by brothers, fathers, etc., in coloured townships. Why is no one studying this? Has it just been under-reported, not studied, or what?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United Nations]] [[UNAIDS]] 2015 Terminology Guidelines suggests that the term ''corrective rape'' should no longer be used, as it gives off the perception that something needs to be fixed. The guidelines propose that the term ''[[homophobic]] rape'' should be used instead.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=United Nations|title=UNAIDS 2015 Terminology Guidelines |url=http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/2015_terminology_guidelines_en.pdf |website=UNAIDS.org |date=2015 |accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MDSmith"/&gt; The words "so-called 'curative' or 'corrective' rape" were mentioned in 2011 in the first UN report on discrimination and violence against [[LGBT+]] people.&lt;ref name="UNreport2011"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/19session/A.HRC.19.41_English.pdf |title=Discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity |author= |work=Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights |publisher=[[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] |date=17 November 2011 |accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 global study on [[HIV/AIDS]] suggested the term ''[[lesbophobia|lesphobic]] rape'' to emphasize the fact that [[lesbians]] constitute the overwhelmingly majority of victims of this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="RASmith"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=Raymond A. (ed.) |date=2010 |title=Global HIV/AIDS Politics, Policy, and Activism: Persistent Challenges and Emerging Issues: Persistent Challenges and Emerging Issues |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdXYAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA49 |location=Santa Barbara |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=49 |isbn=9780313399466 |accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have emphasized that gay men, [[transgender]] people and [[Asexuality|asexuals]] can also be victims of corrective rape.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter-Gault (2015), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MDSmith178"&gt;Merrill D. Smith (2018), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denton"/&gt;

==Contributing factors and motivations==
Corrective rape is a [[hate crime]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, due to [[homophobia]] and [[heteronormativity]], hate crimes based on sexuality (as opposed to race, gender, class, age, etc.) are often not recognized by authorities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A 2000 study suggested an atmosphere supportive of hate crimes against gay men and lesbians, reactions to hate crimes by the broader community, and responses by police and justice systems contribute to corrective rape.&lt;ref name="Bartle" /&gt;

Some people believe corrective rape can "fix" people who do not conform to gender norms or who are not heterosexual. [[ActionAid]] reports that survivors remember being told that they were being taught a lesson.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.actionaid.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/hate_crimes_the_rise_of_corrective_rape_in_south_africa_september_2009.pdf|title=ActionAid|last=|first=|date=2009 |publisher=ActionAid|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some perpetrators of the hate crime are impelled by a sense of misogyny and chauvinism.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy, Vasu, Cheryl-Ann Potgieter, and Nonhlanhla Mkhize. "Cloud over the rainbow nation:'corrective rape'and other hate crimes against black lesbians." (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources argue that many cases of corrective rape are caused by [[is–ought problem|drawing moral conclusions]] from the [[nature–nurture debate]]. Despite the scientific community believing that sexual orientation is the result of biology and environment,&lt;ref name="pediatrics2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.113.6.1827 |author=Frankowski BL|author2=American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Adolescence|title=Sexual orientation and adolescents |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]|volume=113 |issue=6 |pages=1827–32 |date=June 2004|pmid=15173519|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/6/1827.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamanna"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Mary Ann Lamanna, Agnes Riedmann, Susan D Stewart|title=Marriages, Families, and Relationships: Making Choices in a Diverse Society|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=1305176898|year=2014|page=82|accessdate=February 11, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fofaAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82|quote=The reason some individuals develop a gay sexual identity has not been definitively established &amp;nbsp;– nor do we yet understand the development of heterosexuality.

Because of this, some of these people believe sexual orientation can be changed or, as they see it, fixed.&lt;ref&gt;McCommon B (2006). "Antipsychiatry and the Gay Rights Movement".

== Intersectionality ==
[[Intersectionality]] is ''intersecting'' social identities and related systems of [[oppression]], [[Dominance hierarchy|domination]], or [[discrimination]]. In South Africa, black lesbians face homophobia, [[sexism]], [[racism]], and [[classism]]. Research in 2008 by Triangle, a gay rights group, revealed that black lesbians were twice as afraid of sexual assault compared to white lesbians.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, black women who identify as lesbians are seen as "un-African" by their peers.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=3d95b04c-aa02-4955-8d90-80637d88d9e2%2540sessionmgr104&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=108|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking into account race and sexuality together is essential when examining corrective rape, as both subjects cross into each other and influence each other heavily.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=Feb 2013|title=Rape as a Weapon of Hate: Discursive Constructions and Material Consequences of Black Lesbianism in South Africa|url=|journal=Women's Studies in Communication|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intersectionality plays a major role in corrective rape cases, as many occur in underdeveloped countries such as South Africa and India in which race, class, and gender are factors in the rights an individual will receive. Sexuality and gender especially, define the social and political rank of victims. Many are ostracized, and other abusive measures are taken in order to cure individuals of their sexuality.

== Impact on victims ==
Corrective rape and other accompanying acts of violence can result in [[physical trauma|physical]] and [[psychological trauma]], mutilation, unwanted [[pregnancy]], and may contribute to [[suicide]].&lt;ref name="Hawthorne" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mabuse" /&gt; Corrective rape is a major contributor to [[HIV]] infection in South African lesbians.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt; In South Africa approximately 10% of lesbians are HIV positive, with corrective rape being the most likely cause.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; HIV in South Africa is pandemic, and due to homophobia there is a  lack of education about sexually transmitted diseases among lesbians. Homophobic laws and discrimination in South Africa contribute to the poor quality of health care for minorities.

The psychological effects of corrective rape on victims can be detrimental. Many victims in countries such as South Africa and India where corrective rape is most prevalent suffer from a strong sense of insecurity and disempowerment due to strong homophobia in their communities. This homophobia can lead to both physical and psychological violence. There have been at least 30 lesbians who have been murdered in South Africa in the last 15 years because of their sexual orientation.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} However, violence against the LGBTQ community in South Africa is seldom reported.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Survivors of corrective rape suffer from triple discrimination for being a female, black, and homosexual.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is especially true in South African townships, where corrective rape is common for lesbian women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nduna|first=Mzikazi|date=2012|title=Disempowerment And Psychological Distress In The Lives Of Young People In Eastern Cape, South Africa|url=|journal=Journal of Child and Family Studies|volume=21|issue=6|pages=1018|doi=10.1007/s10826-011-9564-y|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corrective rape victims may suffer from [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[Anxiety disorder|anxiety]], and/or [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=du Toit|first=Louise|date=2014|title=Shifting Meanings of Postconflict Sexual Violence in South Africa|url=|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=40|pages=101|doi=10.1086/676895|jstor=10.1086/676895|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to racial and sexual discrimination in health care, victims must often deal with these issues on their own.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Children in India have been speaking out about how their parents are sanctioning the child's sexuality by using "corrective rape therapy" (same as corrective rape).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/relationships/parenting/Victims-of-corrective-rape-speak-up/articleshow/47602170.cm|title=Victims of Corrective Rape Speak Up|date=June 2015|work=Times of India|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corrective rape in India typically happens in order to protect the family name, to avoid shaming from religious communities, and to prevent abnormal perception by the surrounding community. In India, there is a general discomfort with discussing homosexuality, even if an individual identifies as homosexual. This discomfort comes from the overall negative attitude towards homosexuality and the fact is that individuals in India who identify as homosexual are victimized at a higher rate. There is also a high level of negativity towards the trans community in India. Religious commitments tend to be very strong in traditional cultures and this is where much of the tension and poor perception came from. According to statistics from the Crisis Intervention Team of LGBT Collective in Telangana, India, there have been 15 reported instances of corrective rape that have been reported in the last 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=India's Bollywood Speaks Out Against Rape|last=MM Vetticad|first=Anna|date=10 July 2014|work=Newspaper|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, there has been a 902 percent increase in reported rapes in India from 1971 to 2012; however, it is estimated that 90% of sex crimes in the country go unreported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/07/india-bollywood-speaks-out-against-rape-201471075423510320.html|title=India's Bollywood speaks out against rape|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amnesty International has received reports of violence against lesbians in [[Jamaica]], including rape and other forms of sexual violence. Lesbians reportedly have been attacked on the grounds of mannish physical appearance or other visible signs of sexuality. Some reports of abduction and rape come from inner-city communities, where local non-governmental organizations have expressed concerns about high incidences of violence against women.&lt;ref name="Czyzselska"/&gt;

In Kenya, perpetrators and apologists claim that rape is a method "to straighten" LGBTI people.&lt;ref name="KHRC"/&gt;

The perpetrator may claim to be teaching the women a lesson on how to be a "real woman".&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt; Because women have less control over their [[economics]], which creates economic vulnerability, they have less control over their own sexual activities.&lt;ref name="Mieses" /&gt;  Poor black women who live in townships are more likely to become victims of corrective violence, and gay women are more likely to be isolated with little support, which increases their chances of being targeted.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mabuse" /&gt;

The [[South African Constitution]] is one of the most progressive constitutions in the world. It states that no person shall be discriminated against based on his or her gender, [[race (human categorization)|race]], or sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mieses" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; [[Equality Act (South Africa)|The Equality Act]] of 2000 specifically bans [[hate crime]]s, crimes in which people are targeted because of one or more aspects of their identity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although this technically includes crimes based on sexual orientation, in practice such cases are not brought to trial.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Crimes based on sexual orientation are not expressly recognized in South Africa; corrective rape reports are not separated from general rape reports.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mabuse" /&gt; In December 2009, there had been 31 recorded murders of lesbians in South Africa since 1998, but only one had resulted in a conviction.&lt;ref name="Mieses" /&gt;

The reason for this discrepancy between the law and practice is a result of [[heteronormativity]] and homophobia in South Africa. Heteronormativity can be defined as "the institutions, structures of understanding, and practical orientations that make heterosexuality not only seem coherent—that is organised as a sexuality—but also privileged".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=7107cbc9-729a-47b1-995e-a1608ec7c9aa%2540sessionmgr115&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=108|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians believe the heteronormativity in South Africa can be attributed to the nation's postcolonial years of racism, and it appears that today many South Africans are recommitted to their traditional heritage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Black South African lesbians are not included in this [[social construction]], and this leads back to the concept of [[intersectionality]]. Black lesbians in South Africa are not only excluded because of their sexual orientation but also because of their ethnicity. As displayed in the media, most homosexuality is displayed as white, leaving black lesbians in South African even more marginalized.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In South Africa, homosexuality is regarded as "un-African" by some.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2004, the [[Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa)|Human Science Research Council]] found that 78% of the respondents thought of homosexuality as unacceptable. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], in the last 20 years, attitudes toward [[homosexuality]] have become worse in South Africa.&lt;ref name="Hazelton" /&gt;

Corrective rape is on the rise in South Africa. More than 10 lesbians are raped weekly to correct their sexual preferences, as estimated by Luleki Sizwe, a South African nonprofit.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Contemporary Sexuality" /&gt; It is estimated that at least 500 lesbians become victims of corrective rape every year and that 86% of black lesbians in the [[Western Cape]] live in fear of being [[sexually assaulted]], as reported by the Triangle Project in 2008.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt; Yet victims of corrective rape are less likely to report it because of the negative social view of homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt; Under-reporting is high for sexually violent crimes, thus the number of corrective rapes are likely higher than what is reported.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt;

Although it is thought to be uncommon, men also become victims of corrective rape. A study conducted by OUT [[LGBT]] Well-being and the University of South Africa Centre for Applied Psychology (UCAP) showed that "the percentage of black gay men who said they have experienced corrective rape matched that of the black lesbians who partook in the study".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Louw|first1=Angelo|title=Men are also 'corrective rape' victims |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-04-11-men-are-also-corrective-rape-victims|website=Mail&amp;Guardian |accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all men admit to being victims of corrective rape.

One South African man stated, "Lesbians get raped and killed because it is accepted by our community and by our culture."&lt;ref name="Middleton" /&gt; Kekelesto explained that her experience as "where men try to turn you into a real African woman" and that she was being taught how to be a black woman.&lt;ref name="academia.edu" /&gt;

Galip Asvat, a successful hair salon business owner, is a gay man born in [[Klerksdorp]]. He moved to [[Hillbrow]], which was a haven for the LGBT community, in the early 2000s.&lt;ref name="mg.co.za"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Louw|first1=Angelo|title=Men are also 'corrective rape' victims|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-04-11-men-are-also-corrective-rape-victims|website=Mail&amp;Guardian|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One early morning in 2007, Asvat was ambushed and raped by three men in his apartment building. On his attack, he said, "They thought I was a woman, and when they found out I was a man, that's when they became even more violent."&lt;ref name="mg.co.za"/&gt; His beating was brutal and the gang of men nearly cut off his genitals.

Sizakele Sigasa, a lesbian activist living in [[Soweto]], and her partner Salome Masooa were raped, [[torture]]d, and murdered in July 2007. South African lesbian-[[gay rights]] organizations, including the umbrella-group Joint Working Group, said the attack was driven by lesbophobia.&lt;ref name="Ndaba"/&gt; Two other rape/murders of lesbians occurred in South Africa earlier in Summer 2007: Simangele Nhlapo, member of an [[HIV-positive]] support group was raped and murdered in June, along with her two-year-old daughter; and Madoe Mafubedu, age 16, was raped and stabbed to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pithouse |first=Richard |title=Only Protected on Paper |url=http://sacsis.org.za/site/article/644.1 |publisher=The South African Civil Society Information Service |accessdate=22 December 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QiX79Fi5?url=http://sacsis.org.za/site/article/644.1 |archivedate=30 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 April 2008, 31-year-old soccer player [[Eudy Simelane]] was abducted, gang-raped and killed in [[KwaThema]], her hometown near Johannesburg.&lt;ref name="HRW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt; Simelane was a star of the South Africa's acclaimed [[Banyana Banyana]] national female football squad, an avid equality rights campaigner, and one of the first women to live openly as a lesbian in KwaThema.&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt;

On 24 April 2011, LGBT activist [[Noxolo Nogwaza]] was raped and murdered in KwaThema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13265300 |title=South Africa killing of lesbian Nogwaza 'a hate crime' |date=3 May 2011 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=28 November 2012 |archivedate=29 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CXiYuzvx?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13265300 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, two writers from South African men's magazine ''[[FHM]]'' were fired as a result of corrective rape jokes they made on Facebook. After a disciplinary hearing on Friday, July 19, 2013, ''FHM'' dismissed both men from their positions, calling their comments "entirely unacceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2013-07-19-fhm-fires-rape-comment-writers|title=FHM fires writers over rape comments|first=Staff|last=Reporter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africa is a signatory of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), which obligates states to remove discriminatory barriers from the full and free exercise of rights by women. The Convention's duty to modify the conduct of private citizens to ensure equality for women covers attitudes that include the inferiority of women and stereotyped gender roles, which arguably encompass the animus toward gay women that motivates many men to commit corrective rape.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt; 66% of South Africa women said they did not report their attack because they would not be taken seriously.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt; Of these, 25% said they feared exposing their sexual orientation to the police and 22% said they were afraid of being abused by the police.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt;

In August 2011, the [[Department of Justice and Constitutional Development|Department of Justice]] established a National Task Team (NTT) to address the issue of hate crimes against LGBT people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Team starts work on gay hate crimes |agency=[[South African Press Association|SAPA]]-DPA |date=10 August 2011 |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/team-starts-work-on-gay-hate-crimes-1.1115051 |newspaper=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|IOL News]] |accessdate=15 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RD3RrFs8?url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/team-starts-work-on-gay-hate-crimes-1.1115051 |archivedate=20 July 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, then [[Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development|Minister of Justice]] [[Jeff Radebe]] launched a National Intervention Strategy for the LGBTI Sector developed by the NTT to address sex-based violence and [[gender-based violence]] against members of the community. The NTT has established a rapid response team to attend to unsolved criminal cases as a matter of urgency and produced an information pamphlet with frequently asked questions about LGBTI persons. Radebe stated that the Department of Justice acknowledged the need for a specific legal framework for hate crimes and that the matter would be subjected to public debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Intervention Strategy for LGBTI Sector 2014|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/vg/lgbti/2014-LGBTI-Strategy.pdf|publisher=Department of Justice and Constitutional Development|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Radebe launches LGBTI violence programme |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/radebe-launches-lgbti-violence-programme-1.1681563 |accessdate=20 July 2014 |agency=SAPA |newspaper=IOL |date=29 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RD3bz2dy?url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/radebe-launches-lgbti-violence-programme-1.1681563 |archivedate=20 July 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diale|first1=Lerato|title=Plan to combat gender violence|url=http://www.thenewage.co.za/124285-1007-53-Plan_to_combat_gender_violence|accessdate=20 July 2014|work=The New Age|date=30 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720144529/http://www.thenewage.co.za/124285-1007-53-Plan_to_combat_gender_violence|archivedate=20 July 2014|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, there was an article published that stated that there are about 10 new cases of corrective rape a week in Cape Town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/92198/south-africa-activism-makes-inroads-corrective-rape|title=Activism makes inroads on 'corrective rape'|date=2011-03-15|website=IRIN|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cape Town|Cape Town, South Africa]] specifically has 2.5 million people and since 2011, the prevalence of Corrective Rape has only increased.

Five cases in which the victims were lesbians or transgender males were reported in [[Uganda]] between June and November, 2011.&lt;ref name="GuarUganda"/&gt;

=== United States ===
In the [[United States]], [[Brandon Teena]] (1972–1993) is one of the best-known victims of corrective rape (and thereafter murder) for being a [[trans man]]. The book ''All She Wanted'' (1996) and the two films ''[[The Brandon Teena Story]]'' (1998) and ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]'' (1999) were about him.&lt;ref name="MDSmith178"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=McOrmond-Plummer |first1=Louise |last2=Easteal |first2=Patricia |last3=Levy-Peck |first3=Jennifer Y. |date=2014 |title=Intimate Partner Sexual Violence: A Multidisciplinary Guide to Improving Services and Support for Survivors of Rape and Abuse |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1dnDAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA266 |location=London |publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers |page=266 |isbn=9780857006554 |accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zimbabwe ===
{{Further|LGBT rights in Zimbabwe}}

A U.S. State Department report on Zimbabwe states, "In response to social pressure, some families reportedly subjected their LGBT members to corrective rape and forced marriages to encourage heterosexual conduct. Such crimes were rarely reported to police. Women, in particular, were subjected to rape by male family members."&lt;ref name="USZimbabwe2012"/&gt; 
Following the publication of an earlier report with similar wording,&lt;ref name="USZimbabwe2009"/&gt; Zimbabwean journalist [[Angus Shaw (writer)|Angus Shaw]] said that lesbian women are raped by men to make them enjoy heterosexual acts and gay men are raped by women to remove their sexual orientation tendencies.&lt;ref name="Gonda"/&gt;

==Campaigning and activism==
Child sponsorship charity [[ActionAid]] has published an article discussing corrective rape, and see ending violence against women as a pivotal part of their mission.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt; The group joined with 26 gay and women's rights and community groups, to organize a campaign focused on South Africa but also aimed at the international community, to raise awareness of the issues.  The campaign was dedicated to raising awareness about the rape and murder of two lesbian women in a Johannesburg township and called for sexual orientation to be specifically recognised as grounds for protection by police and justice systems.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt;

Ndumie Funda, a South African Social Justice Activist, started her work to end Corrective Rape by launching a social campaign on [[Change.org]] in hopes to have the South African Government recognize hate crimes committed due to biases against sexual orientation and provide protection for victims. This particular petition ended up gathering almost 200 thousand signatures from individuals making up over 175 different countries-this forced the government to recognize this issue. The government agreed to meeting Funda and in 2014 South Africa passed its first law against hate crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedp.com/article/2015/02/south-africa-ndumie-funda|title=Activist takes on mission against "corrective" rape|website=www.thedp.com|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8564">In [[differential geometry]], one can attach to every point ''x'' of a [[smooth manifold|smooth (or differentiable) manifold]] a [[vector space]] called the '''cotangent space''' at ''x''. Typically, the cotangent space is defined as the [[dual space]] of the [[tangent space]] at ''x'', although there are more direct definitions (see below). The elements of the cotangent space are called '''cotangent vectors''' or '''tangent covectors'''.

==Properties==
All cotangent spaces on a connected manifold have the same [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]], equal to the dimension of the manifold. All the cotangent spaces of a manifold can be "glued together" (i.e. unioned and endowed with a topology) to form a new differentiable manifold of twice the dimension, the [[cotangent bundle]] of the manifold.

The tangent space and the cotangent space at a point are both real vector spaces of the same dimension and therefore [[isomorphic]] to each other via many possible isomorphisms. The introduction of a [[Riemannian metric]] or a [[symplectic form]] gives rise to a [[natural isomorphism]] between the tangent space and the cotangent space at a point, associating to any tangent covector a canonical tangent vector.

==Formal definitions==

===Definition as linear functionals===

Let ''M'' be a smooth manifold and let ''x'' be a point in ''M''. Let ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' be the [[tangent space]] at ''x''. Then the cotangent space at ''x'' is defined as the [[dual space]] of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'':
:''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' = (''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
Concretely, elements of the cotangent space are [[linear functional]]s on ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''. That is, every element α ∈ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' is a [[linear map]]
:&amp;alpha; : ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' &amp;rarr; '''F'''
where '''F''' is the underlying [[field (mathematics)|field]] of the vector space being considered. For example, the field of [[real number]]s. The elements of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' are called cotangent vectors.

===Alternative definition===

In some cases, one might like to have a direct definition of the cotangent space without reference to the tangent space. Such a definition can be formulated in terms of [[equivalence class]]es of smooth functions on ''M''. Informally, we will say that two smooth functions ''f'' and ''g'' are equivalent at a point ''x'' if they have the same first-order behavior near ''x'', analogous to their linear Taylor polynomials; two functions ''f'' and ''g'' have the same first order behaviour near ''x'' if and only if the derivative of the function ''f''-''g'' vanishes at ''x''. The cotangent space will then consist of all the possible first-order behaviors of a function near ''x''.

Let ''M'' be a smooth manifold and let ''x'' be a point in ''M''. Let ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; be the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of all functions in C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') vanishing at ''x'', and let ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; be the set of functions of the form &lt;math&gt;\sum_i f_i g_i\,&lt;/math&gt;, where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. Then ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are real vector spaces and the cotangent space is defined as the [[Quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' = ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

This formulation is analogous to the construction of the cotangent space to define the [[Zariski tangent space]] in algebraic geometry. The construction also generalizes to [[locally ringed space]]s.

==The differential of a function==

Let ''M'' be a smooth manifold and let ''f'' ∈ C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') be a [[smooth function]]. The differential of ''f'' at a point ''x'' is the map
:d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''f'')
where ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[Differential geometry of curves|tangent vector]] at ''x'', thought of as a derivation. That is &lt;math&gt;X(f)=\mathcal{L}_Xf&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lie derivative]] of ''f'' in the direction ''X'', and one has d''f''(''X'')=''X''(''f'').  Equivalently, we can think of tangent vectors as tangents to curves, and write
:d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;gamma;&amp;prime;(0)) = (''f'' o &amp;gamma;)&amp;prime;(0)
In either case, d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is a linear map on ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' and hence it is a tangent covector at ''x''.

We can then define the differential map d : C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') → ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' at a point ''x'' as the map which sends ''f'' to d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. Properties of the differential map include:

# d is a linear map: d(''af'' + ''bg'') = ''a'' d''f'' + ''b'' d''g'' for constants ''a'' and ''b'',
# d(''fg'')&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''(''x'')d''g''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''g''(''x'')d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;,

The differential map provides the link between the two alternate definitions of the cotangent space given above. Given a function ''f'' ∈ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; (a smooth function vanishing at ''x'') we can form the linear functional d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; as above. Since the map d restricts to 0 on ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (the reader should verify this), d descends to a map from ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to the dual of the tangent space, (''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. One can show that this map is an isomorphism, establishing the equivalence of the two definitions.

==The pullback of a smooth map==

Just as every differentiable map ''f'' : ''M'' → ''N'' between manifolds induces a linear map (called the ''pushforward'' or ''derivative'') between the tangent spaces
:&lt;math&gt;f_{*}^{}\colon T_x M \to T_{f(x)} N&lt;/math&gt;
every such map induces a linear map (called the ''[[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]]'') between the cotangent spaces, only this time in the reverse direction:
:&lt;math&gt;f^{*}\colon T_{f(x)}^{*} N \to T_{x}^{*} M&lt;/math&gt;
The pullback is naturally defined as the dual (or transpose) of the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]]. Unraveling the definition, this means the following:
:&lt;math&gt;(f^{*}\theta)(X_x) = \theta(f_{*}^{}X_x)&lt;/math&gt;
where θ ∈ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''f''(''x'')&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''N'' and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''. Note carefully where everything lives.

If we define tangent covectors in terms of equivalence classes of smooth maps vanishing at a point then the definition of the pullback is even more straightforward. Let ''g'' be a smooth function on ''N'' vanishing at ''f''(''x''). Then the pullback of the covector determined by ''g'' (denoted d''g'') is given by
:&lt;math&gt;f^{*}\mathrm dg = \mathrm d(g \circ f).&lt;/math&gt;
That is, it is the equivalence class of functions on ''M'' vanishing at ''x'' determined by ''g'' o ''f''.

==Exterior powers==

The ''k''-th [[exterior power]] of the cotangent space, denoted Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M''), is another important object in differential geometry. Vectors in the ''k''th exterior power, or more precisely sections of the ''k''-th exterior power of the [[cotangent bundle]], are called [[differential form|differential ''k''-forms]]. They can be thought of as alternating, [[multilinear map]]s on ''k'' tangent vectors. 
For this reason, tangent covectors are frequently called ''[[one-form]]s''.

'''Death and adjustment hypotheses''' ('''DAH''') is a theory about death and dying that focuses on [[death anxiety (psychology)]] and adjustment to death.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://glencoe.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078883601/680442/Additional_Lifespan_Development_Topics.pdf Theories on Death and Dying]'', McGraw-Hill, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It was presented by [[Mohammad Samir Hossain]] as an answer to the overwhelming anxiety and grief about death.&lt;ref&gt;Md Zakaria Siddique, "A review of ''Quest for a New Death: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses''", ''Death Studies'', vol. 33, no. 2 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Meyers, Robert N. Golden, and Fred Peterson (eds.). ''The Truth about Death and Dying''. 2nd ed. New York: DWJ Books, 2009, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to find the resolution to death anxiety, predominantly the existential one, DAH postulates two key themes. Its first part postulates that death should not be considered the end of existence and the second part emphasizes that the belief in immortal pattern of human existence can only be adopted in a morally rich life with the attitude towards morality and materialism balanced mutually.

==Beginning==

The theory was first promoted in the book ''Quest for a New Death: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses'' in 2007. A second book with its elaboration, ''Human Immortality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated'', was published in 2008. Both books were authored by Hossain. Later the journal ''[[Death Studies]]'' and [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] reviewed these publications for the readerships in Scientific Thanatology and Spiritual Psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, P. (2009). Human Adjustment and the Problem of Death. Death Studies, 33 (8), 771–774&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siddique, M. Z. (2009)Reviewing the Phenomenon of Death—A Scientific Effort from the Islamic World. Death Studies, 33 (2), 190–195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fenwick, P. (2009). Book Reviewing by Dr. Peter Fenwick. Newsletter, 27, Spirituality and Special Interest Group. The Royal College of Psychiatrists. London. at http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/college/specialinterestgroups/spirituality/publications/newsletter27.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  After the analyses of the reviewers were published, the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] at London published the theory itself as the short article ''Facing the Finality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses''&lt;ref&gt;http://rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Hossain%20Facing%20the%20Finality.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] publication ''Journal of Loss and Trauma'' did the same in its article "Introducing Death and Adjustment Hypotheses".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mohammad Samir Hossain. "Introducing Death and Adjustment Hypotheses". ''Journal of Loss and Trauma'', vol. 15, no. 4 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Hossain was intolerant to death himself. His childhood was terrified with the anticipatory thoughts of his parents' death. When his elder son Mohammad Seeyam Samir died, parallel to developing support for himself, Hossain decided to put forward his resolutions for death anxiety and grief through the scientific readerships. His research works during and after that period gave birth to the articles and books that he later published promoting the theory and for sufferers of intense death anxiety. Hossain's works on the theory further flourished as his parents' terminal illnesses appeared and compelled him to adjust himself comprehensively to the phenomenon of death for a peaceful personal life. He admitted in one of his autobiographical articles that without the turmoils in his own life he could never realize about the disasters and work to prevent them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hossain, MS, 2011, Abstinence: A Memoir, Journal of Loss and Trauma, 16:5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key components==

Factors behind the DAH are described in ''European Psychiatry'', Volume 26, Supplement 1, Page 1727 in the following manner –

"Viewed from a naturalistic and scientific perspective, death appears to represent the permanent cessation of human existence, contributing to the widespread experience of death anxiety. The present argument attempts to deconstruct this argument on epistemological grounds by analyzing
1) the prevailing universal concept of death in naturalistic discourse, &lt;br/&gt;
2) the issue of our adjustment to this presumed reality, and &lt;br/&gt;
3) the relationship between existence and death in the context of their social evolution. &lt;br/&gt;
Integrating this conceptual analysis with empirical observations, the paper then explores the contrasting postulate, namely that death may not be the end of our existence, and the moral
implications of this alternative assumption. This position, termed the "death adjustment hypotheses," would seem to offer an alternative grounding for theory and research in Thanatology."

===Concept of death===

Finding a common platform regarding the concept of death was the first step towards this work. Dr Hossain's finding was that without a common idea about death people will not be able to share the same remedy for death anxiety.&lt;ref name="MohammadSamir"&gt;Mohammad Samir Hossain and Peter Gilbert. 2010. Concepts of Death: A key to our adjustment. ''Illness, Crisis and Loss'', Vol 18. No 1&lt;/ref&gt; There are many scientific approaches to the concept. For example, brain death, as practiced in medical science, defines death as a point in time at which brain activity ceases.&lt;ref name="MohammadSamir" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078883601/680442/Additional_Lifespan_Development_Topics.pdf |title=Additional Lifespan Development Topics |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Fenwick%20Book%20Review%20Human%20Immortality;%20%20Death%20and%20Adjustment%20Hypotheses%20Elaborated.x.x.pdf Human Immortality; Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated.] Book Review by Dr. Peter Fenwick&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Hossain%20Facing%20the%20Finality.pdf Facing the finality – Death and Adjustment Hypotheses] Dr. Mohammad Samir Hossain, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It was Hossain's claim that whenever death is taken as permanent and absolute cessation of human existence, morbid fear of death begins; therefore DAH he presented with different ideas of death in relation to existence to reach a conclusion that will be acceptable to most.&lt;ref name="Hossain, M S 2007"&gt;Hossain, M S. 2007. Quest for a new death: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses. Booksurge Publishing, Charleston, US&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death anxiety as a whole===

Death anxiety is the central concern of DAH. It is the morbid, abnormal or persistent fear of one's own death or the process of his/her dying. One definition of death anxiety is a "feeling of dread, apprehension or solicitude (anxiety) when one thinks of the process of dying, or ceasing to ‘be’".&lt;ref&gt;Definition by Farley G.: Death anxiety. National Health Service UK. 2010, found in: {{cite journal|url=http://benthamscience.com/open/tonursj/articles/V007/14TONURSJ.pdf |title=How death anxiety impacts nurses' caring for patients at the end of life: a review of literature |vauthors=Peters L, Cant R, Payne S, O'Connor M, McDermott F, Hood K, Morphet J, Shimoinaba K |journal=Open Nurs J. |year=2013 |volume=7 |pages=14–21 |doi=10.2174/1874434601307010014 |pmid=23400515 |pmc=3565229 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014172346/http://benthamscience.com/open/tonursj/articles/V007/14TONURSJ.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to as thanatophobia (fear of death), and is distinguished from  [[necrophobia]], which is a specific fear of  dead or dying persons and/or things (i.e. others who are dead or dying, not one's own death or dying).&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition copyright ©2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Updated in 2009. Published by Houghton Mifflin Company&lt;/ref&gt; DAH proposes that no one is free from this anxiety unless there is something significantly positive in the phenomenon of death for humans. Hossain claimed, the idea of 'cessation of existence' through death is the prime factor responsible for initiating death anxiety in one.&lt;ref&gt;Hossain, M S.2008. Human Immortality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated. Booksurge Publishing, Charleston, US.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existential death anxiety===

It is apparent that Hossain's description of death anxiety in DAH actually overlaps the idea of existential death anxiety, which is the basic knowledge and awareness that life must end. However, DAH indicates 'existence' as the primary humane need and 'pleasure' as the secondary one. Therefore, DAH postulates, though existential death anxiety strongly correlates behavioral changes,&lt;ref name=langs&gt;Langs, R. (1997). Death Anxiety and Clinical Practice. London: Karnac Books; Langs, R. (2004). "Death anxiety and the emotion-processing mind," ''Psychoanalytic Psychology'', vol. 21, no.1, 31-53; Langs, R. (2004) ''Fundamentals of Adaptive Psychotherapy and Counseling''. London: Palgrave-Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; pleasure in existence must be ensured to maintain the balance between life and death peacefully. Hossain, in the iteration of DAH, highlighted how this sort of death anxiety evolved in the society through time based on his analysis of the history of the West starting from 5th century up to 20th century. DAH adds that assurance of pleasure or pain-free status in any existence after death is another key factor in adjusting with the phenomenon of death even if one is not overwhelmed by existential death anxiety due to his/her belief in any sort of existence after death.&lt;ref&gt;Hossain, M S. 2008. Human Immortality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated. Booksurge Publishing. Charleston, US&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materialism, immorality and judgment issues===
Hossain explained, as existence after death creates the scope for being judged and punished for the immoral deeds in life, most self-claimed believers pass through the denial of afterlife for their immorality in search of limitless materialistic pleasure. Therefore, one of the key propositions of DAH was the fact that mostly humans abandon their moral ethics due to heightened materialism that gives birth to existential death anxiety even among the self-claimed believers in the existence after death.&lt;ref name="Hossain, M S 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name=MeyersGoldenPeterson&gt;Karen Meyers, Robert N. Golden, Fred Peterson. Infobase Publishing, 2009, 106 page. Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books?id=V-wan_XhkzcC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=Mohammad+Samir+Hossain&lt;/ref&gt;

==Declarations of the Death and adjustment hypotheses==

As outlined very briefly in journal articles, DAH hypothesizes the following for optimum attitude towards death as well as to harmonize the adjustment problems in relation to the phenomenon:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

*Death and Adjustment Hypotheses – One: In the absence of empirical evidence from science, to regard death to be not our absolute end seems natural and is an epistemologically sound point of view. Therefore, it is also more useful practically and for our adjustment to the phenomenon.
*Death and Adjustment Hypotheses – Two: Changing our materialistic view to a moral one on life can help eradicate the social denial of death through the establishment of a sound concept of the phenomenon at personal and societal level, which should also potentate our adjustment to the phenomenon.

[[Image:Northern Rock Queue.jpg|thumb|A 2007 run on Northern Rock, a British bank]]
The '''Diamond–Dybvig model''' is an influential [[Model (economics)|model]] of [[bank run]]s and related [[financial crisis|financial crises]]. The model shows how banks' mix of illiquid assets (such as business or mortgage loans) and liquid liabilities (deposits which may be withdrawn at any time) may give rise to self-fulfilling panics among  depositors.

==Theory==
The model, published in 1983 by [[Douglas W. Diamond]] of the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Philip H. Dybvig]], then of [[Yale University]] and now of [[Washington University in St. Louis]], shows how an institution with long-maturity assets and short-maturity liabilities can be unstable.

===Structure of the model===
Diamond and Dybvig's paper points out that business investment often requires expenditures in the present to obtain returns in the future.  Therefore, they prefer loans with a long [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]] (that is, low [[liquidity]]).  The same principle applies to individuals seeking financing to purchase large-ticket items such as [[House|housing]] or [[automobile]]s.  On the other hand, individual savers (both households and firms) may have sudden, unpredictable needs for cash, due to unforeseen expenditures.  So they demand [[Liquidity|liquid]] accounts which permit them immediate access to their deposits (that is, they value short [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]] deposit accounts).

The banks in the model act as intermediaries between savers who prefer to deposit in liquid accounts and borrowers who prefer to take out long-maturity loans.  Under ordinary circumstances, banks can provide a valuable service by channeling funds from many individual deposits into loans for borrowers.  Individual depositors might not be able to make these loans themselves, since they know they may suddenly need immediate access to their funds, whereas the businesses' investments will only pay off in the future (moreover, by aggregating funds from many different depositors, banks help depositors save on the [[transaction cost]]s they would have to pay in order to lend directly to businesses).  Since banks provide a valuable service to both sides (providing the long-maturity loans businesses want and the liquid accounts depositors want), they can charge a higher interest rate on loans than they pay on deposits and thus profit from the difference.

===Nash equilibria of the model===

Diamond and Dybvig point out that under ordinary circumstances, savers' unpredictable needs for cash are likely to be random, as depositors' needs reflect their individual circumstances. Since depositors' demand for cash are unlikely to occur at the same time, by accepting deposits from many different sources the bank expects only a small fraction of withdrawals in the short term, even though all depositors have the right to withdraw their full deposit at any time.  Thus, a bank can make loans over a long horizon, while keeping only relatively small amounts of cash on hand to pay any depositors that wish to make withdrawals. Mathematically, individual withdrawals are largely [[correlation|uncorrelated]], and by the [[law of large numbers]] banks expect a relatively stable number of withdrawals on any given day.

However a different outcome is also possible.  Since banks lend out at long maturity, they cannot quickly call in their loans.  And even if they tried to call in their loans, borrowers would be unable to pay back quickly, since their loans were, by assumption, used to finance long-term investments.  Therefore, if all depositors attempt to withdraw their funds simultaneously, a bank will run out of money long before it is able to pay all the depositors.  The bank will be able to pay the first depositors who demand their money back, but if all others attempt to withdraw too, the bank will go bankrupt and the last depositors will be left with nothing.

This means that even healthy banks are potentially vulnerable to panics, usually called [[bank run]]s.  If a depositor expects all other depositors to withdraw their funds, then it is irrelevant whether the banks' long term loans are likely to be profitable; the only rational response for the depositor is to rush to take his or her deposits out before the other depositors remove theirs.  In other words, the Diamond–Dybvig model views bank runs as a type of [[self-fulfilling prophecy]]: each depositor's incentive to withdraw funds depends on what they expect other depositors to do.  If enough depositors expect other depositors to withdraw their funds, then they all have an incentive to rush to be the first in line to withdraw their funds.

In theoretical terms, the Diamond–Dybvig model provides an example of an [[Game theory|economic game]] with more than one [[Nash equilibrium]].  If depositors expect most other depositors to withdraw only when they have real expenditure needs, then it is rational for all depositors to withdraw only when they have real expenditure needs.  But if depositors expect most other depositors to rush quickly to close their accounts, then it is rational for all depositors to rush quickly to close their accounts.  Of course, the first equilibrium is better than the second (in the sense of [[Pareto efficiency]]).  If depositors withdraw only when they have real expenditure needs, they all benefit from holding their savings in a liquid, interest-bearing account.  If instead everyone rushes to close their accounts, then they all lose the interest they could have earned, and some of them lose all their savings.  Nonetheless, it is not obvious what any one depositor could do to prevent this mutual loss.

==Policy implications==
In practice, due to [[fractional reserve banking]], banks faced with a bank run usually shut down and refuse to permit more withdrawals. This is called a ''suspension of convertibility'', and engenders further panic in the financial system.  While this may prevent some depositors who have a real need for cash from obtaining access to their money, it also prevents immediate bankruptcy, thus allowing the bank to wait for its loans to be repaid, so that it has enough resources to pay back some or all of its deposits.

However, Diamond and Dybvig argue that unless the total amount of real expenditure needs per period is known with certainty, suspension of convertibility cannot be the optimal mechanism for preventing bank runs.  Instead, they argue that a better way of preventing bank runs is [[deposit insurance]] backed by the government or [[central bank]].  Such insurance pays depositors all or part of their losses in the case of a bank run. If depositors know that they will get their money back even in case of a bank run, they have no reason to participate in a bank run.

Thus, sufficient deposit insurance can eliminate the possibility of bank runs.  In principle, maintaining a deposit insurance program is unlikely to be very costly for the government: as long as bank runs are prevented, deposit insurance will never actually need to be paid out. Bank runs became much rarer in the U.S. after the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] was founded in the aftermath of the bank panics of the [[Great Depression]].  On the other hand, a deposit insurance scheme is likely to lead to [[moral hazard]]: by protecting depositors against bank failure, it makes depositors less careful in choosing where to deposit their money, and thus gives banks less incentive to lend carefully.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10942">{{other uses|Drive reduction theory (learning theory)}}

In [[psychology]], a '''drive theory''' or '''drive doctrine'''&lt;ref name="Mélon96"/&gt; is a theory that attempts to define, analyze, or classify the psychological drives. A drive is an "excitatory state produced by a [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] disturbance",&lt;ref&gt;Seward, J. (1956). drive, incentive, and reinforcement. Psychological Review, 63, 19-203. [https://pallas2.tcl.sc.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=pdh&amp;AN=rev-63-3-195&amp;site=ehost-live]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; an instinctual need that has the power of driving the [[Behavior|behaviour]] of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leopold Szondi]] (1972), [https://books.google.com/books?id=_lMAAAAAMAAJ ''Lehrbuch der Experimentellen Triebdiagnostik''] p.25 quotation: {{quotation|Abschnitt I Trieblehre, Kapitel I Das Menschliche Triebsystem. &lt;br /&gt;
Triebe sind Radikale der menschlichen Handlungen und Verhaltungen. Sie sind die bedingenden und erhaltenden Wurzeln des menschlichen Daseins überhaupt.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drive theory is based on the principle that organisms are born with certain psychological needs and that a negative state of tension is created when these needs are not satisfied. When a need is satisfied, drive is reduced and the organism returns to a state of homeostasis and relaxation. According to the theory, drive tends to increase over time and operates on a feedback control system, much like a thermostat.

== Psychoanalysis ==
{{Psychoanalysis |Concepts}}

In [[psychoanalysis]], drive theory ({{lang-de|Triebtheorie}} or ''{{lang|de|Trieblehre}}'')&lt;ref name="Mélon96"/&gt; refers to the theory of drives, motivations, or instincts, that have clear objects.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} When an internal imbalance is detected by homeostatic mechanisms, a drive to restore balance is produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hockenbury |first=Don |date=2012|title=Psychology |location=United States |publisher=Worth Publishers |page=320 |access-date=June 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, [[Sigmund Freud]] said that a drive theory was what was lacking most in psychoanalysis. He was opposed to [[systematics]] in psychology, rejecting it as a form of paranoia, and instead classified drives with dichotomies like [[Eros_(concept)#Sigmund_Freud|Eros]]/[[Death drive|Thanatos]] drives, the drives toward life and death, respectively, and sexual/ego drives.&lt;ref name="Mélon96"&gt;Mélon, Jean (1996), [http://www.szondiforum.org/t419.htm ''Notes on the History of the Szondi Movement''] ([http://www.szondiforum.org/t429.htm French original]). Text for the Szondi Congress of Cracow, August 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud's ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' was published in Germany in 1930, when the [[Adolf Hitler#Rise to power|rise of fascism]] in that country was well under way, and the warnings of a second European war were leading to opposing calls for rearmament and pacifism. Against this background, Freud wrote "In face of the destructive forces unleashed, now it may be expected that the other of the two 'heavenly forces,' eternal Eros, will put forth his strength so as to maintain himself alongside of his equally immortal adversary."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1961). ''Civilization and its discontents''. J. Strachey, transl. New York: W. W. Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, Hungarian [[psychiatrist]] and psychologist [[Leopold Szondi]] aimed instead at a systematic drive theory.&lt;ref name="Mélon96"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Leopold Szondi]] [1947] (1952), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kOsUAAAAIAAJ ''Experimental Diagnostics of Drives''], Introduction of the first edition, quotation: {{quotation|A drive system must give us a synthetic sight of the whole of the drive activities, comparable to the total impression which white light gives us, but it must also make it possible to display 'the spectrum' of the drives just like light can be divided in colours. It is an extremely difficult task and it is not at all astonishing that we have not yet arrived at this point.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Szondi test#Drive theory and drive diagram|Szondi Drive Diagram]] has been described as a revolutionary addition to psychology, and as paving the way for a theoretical psychiatry and a [[Psychological anthropology|psychoanalytical anthropology]].&lt;ref name="Mélon96"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qKgwAQAAIAAJ ''Livres de France''] (1989), Issues 106-109 quotation: {{quotation|Cherche à jeter les bases d'une authentique anthropologie psychanalytique d'après le schéma pulsionnel de Szondi.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early attachment theory ==

In early [[attachment theory]], behavioural drive reduction was proposed by Dollard and Miller (1950) as an explanation of the mechanisms behind early attachment in infants. Behavioural drive reduction theory suggests that infants are born with innate drives, such as hunger and thirst, which only the caregiver, usually the mother, can reduce. Through a process of [[classical conditioning]], the infant learns to associate the mother with the satisfaction of reduced drive and is thus able to form a key attachment bond. However, this theory is challenged by the work done by [[Harry Harlow]], particularly the experiments involving the [[Harry Harlow#Surrogate mother experiment|maternal separation of rhesus monkeys]], which indicate that comfort possesses greater motivational value than hunger.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Harlow H F; Zimmermann R. R. (1959). [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/130/3373/421 Affectional responses in the infant monkey] Science, vol(130):421-432. [http://web.comhem.se/u52239948/08/harlow59.pdf PDF].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social psychology==

In [[social psychology]], drive theory was used by [[Robert Zajonc]] in 1965 as an explanation of the phenomenon of [[social facilitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Zajonc, R. B. (1965). Social facilitation. ''Science'', ''149'', 269-274.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[audience effect]] notes that, in some cases, the presence of a passive audience will facilitate the better performance of a task, while in other cases the presence of an audience will inhibit the performance of a task. Zajonc's drive theory suggests that the variable determining direction of performance is whether the task is composed of a correct dominant response (that is, the task is perceived as being subjectively easy to the individual) or an incorrect dominant response (perceived as being subjectively difficult).

In the presence of a passive audience, an individual is in a heightened state of [[arousal]]. Increased arousal, or [[stress (biological)|stress]], causes the individual to enact behaviours that form dominant responses, since an individual's dominant response is the most likely response, given the skills which are available. If the dominant response is correct, then social presence enhances performance of the task. However, if the dominant response is incorrect, social presence produces an impaired performance.

=== Corroborative evidence ===

Such behaviour was first noticed by Triplett (1898) while observing the cyclists who were racing together versus cyclists who were racing alone.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} It was found that the mere presence of other cyclists produced greater performance. A similar effect was observed by Chen (1937) in [[ant]]s building colonies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} However, it was not until Zajonc investigated this behaviour in the 1960s that any empirical explanation for the audience effect was pursued.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Zajonc's drive theory is based on an experiment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zajonc | first1 = R. B. | last2 = Heingartner | first2 = A. | last3 = Herman | first3 = E. M. | doi = 10.1037/h0028063 | title = Social enhancement and impairment of performance in the cockroach | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 83 | year = 1969 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; involving the investigation of the effect of social facilitation in [[cockroach]]es. Zajonc devised a study in which individual cockroaches were released into a tube, at the end of which there was a light. In the presence of other cockroaches as spectators, cockroaches were observed to achieve a significantly faster time in reaching the light than those in the control, no-spectator group. However, when cockroaches in the same conditions were given a maze to negotiate, performance was impaired in the spectator condition, demonstrating that incorrect dominant responses in the presence of an audience impair performance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

=== Evaluation apprehension ===

Cottrell's [[evaluation apprehension model]] later refined this theory to include yet another variable in the mechanisms of social facilitation. He suggested that the correctness of dominant responses only plays a role in social facilitation when there is an expectation of social reward or punishment based on performance. His study differs in design from Zajonc's as he introduced a separate condition in which participants were given tasks to perform in the presence of an audience that was blindfolded, and thus unable to evaluate the participant's performance. It was found that no social facilitation effect occurred, and hence the anticipation of performance evaluation must play a role in social facilitation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Evaluation apprehension, however, is only key in human social facilitation and is not observed in other animals.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

[[File:Norbert wiener.jpg|thumb|right|Norbert Weiner, the founder of cybernetics.]]
'''Dualism in cybernetics''' refers to systems or problems in which one or more [[intelligent]] adversaries attempt to exploit the weaknesses of the investigator. Examples could include a game-playing opponent, adversarial law, evolutionary systems of predator/parasite and prey/host, or politics/enslavement attempts. [[Norbert Wiener]], the founder of [[cybernetics]], contrasted "[[Manichean]] devils" (dualistic adversarial systems) with "[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] devils"—systems or problems that, though very complex and difficult to figure out, did not feature an adversary with contrary intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dubberly.com/articles/cybernetics-and-counterculture.html|title=How cybernetics connects computing, counterculture, and design|website=www.dubberly.com|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victories or "expansions of knowledge" in the latter type of system were able to be built upon incrementally, through science (experimentation expanding empirical knowledge bases). Wiener noted that temporary weaknesses (such as errors to perceive all components of a system) were not fatal in attempts to defeat "Augustinian devils" because another experiment could simply be pursued (and he noted that he had personally defeated many "Augustinian devils" with his contributions to science and engineering). By contrast, Wiener observed that temporary lapses in judgment against "Manichean devils" were more often fatal or destructive, due to the desire of the opponent to "win/survive at all costs", even by introducing deception into the system. He said that he had been defeated by many "Manichean devils", such as on occasions when he was temporarily careless in chess.

Although this duality between complexity (in the case of the Augustinian devils) and opposition (in the case of Manichean devils) may seem obvious, it holds deep implications for many areas of science, such as [[game theory]], [[political science]], [[computer science]], [[network science]], [[Security|security science]], [[military science]], [[evolutionary biology]], and [[cryptography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Cont/ContSato.htm|title=20th WCP: The Significance of System Cybernetics for Contemporary Philosophy- Post-Modernity in System Cybernetics|website=www.bu.edu|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32868">{{For|religions sometimes described as "folk religions" or "ethnic religions"|Ethnic religion}}

In [[religious studies]] and [[folkloristics]], '''folk religion''', '''popular religion''', or '''vernacular religion''' comprises various forms and expressions of [[religion]] that are distinct from the official doctrines and practices of [[organized religion]]. The precise definition of folk religion varies among scholars. Sometimes also termed '''popular belief''', it consists of [[ethnic]] or regional [[religion|religious]] customs under the umbrella of a [[religion]], but outside official [[doctrine]] and practices.&lt;ref name="Bowman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowman | first=Marion |editor-first=Steven| editor-last=Sutcliffe |title=Religion: empirical studies |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year=2004 |pages=3–4 |chapter=Chapter 1: Phenomenology, Fieldwork, and Folk Religion |isbn=0-7546-4158-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BU2BSj4dcHMC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22folk+religion%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "folk religion" is generally held to encompass two related but separate subjects.  The first is the religious dimension of [[folk culture]], or the folk-cultural dimensions of religion. The second refers to the study of [[syncretism]]s between two cultures with different stages of formal expression, such as the melange of African folk beliefs and [[Roman Catholicism]] that led to the development of [[Vodun]] and [[Santería]], and similar mixtures of formal religions with folk cultures.

[[Chinese folk religion]], folk Christianity, folk Hinduism, and folk Islam are examples of folk religion associated with major religions. The term is also used, especially by the [[clergy]] of the faiths involved, to describe the desire of people who otherwise infrequently attend religious [[worship]], do not belong to a [[church body|church]] or similar religious society, and who have not made a formal profession of [[faith]] in a particular [[creed]], to have religious weddings or funerals, or (among Christians) to have their children [[baptism|baptised]].&lt;ref name="Bowman"/&gt;

==Definition==
In ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions'', [[John Bowker (theologian)|John Bowker]] characterized "folk religion" as either "religion which occurs in small, local communities which does not adhere to the norms of large systems" or "the appropriation of religious beliefs and practices at a popular level."{{sfn|Bowker|2003}}

[[Don Yoder]] argued that there were five separate ways of defining folk religion.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=12}} The first was a perspective rooted in a [[cultural evolution]]ary framework which understood folk religion as representing the survivals of older forms of religion; in this, it would constitute "the survivals, in an official religious context, of beliefs and behavior inherited from earlier stages of the culture's development".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=12}} This definition would view folk religion in Catholic Europe as the survivals of pre-Christian religion and the folk religion in Protestant Europe as the survivals of Medieval Catholicism.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=12}} The second definition identified by Yoder was the view that folk religion represented the mixture of an official religion with forms of ethnic religion; this was employed to explain the place of folk religion in the syncretic belief systems of the Americas, where Christianity had blended with the religions of [[indigenous American]] and [[indigenous African|African]] communities.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=12&amp;ndash;13}}

Yoder's third definition was that often employed within folkloristics, which held that folk religion was "the interaction of belief, ritual, custom, and mythology in traditional societies", representing that which was often pejoratively characterised as [[superstition]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=13}} The fourth definition provided by Yoder stated that folk religion represented the "folk interpretation and expression of religion". Noting that this definition would not encompass beliefs that were largely unconnected from organised religion, such as in [[witchcraft]], he therefore altered this definition by including the concept of "folk [[religiosity]]", thereby defining folk religion as "the deposit in culture of folk religiosity, the full range of folk attitudes to religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=13&amp;ndash;14}} His fifth and final definition represented a "practical working definition" that combined elements from these various other definitions. Thus, he summarized folk religion as "the totality of all those views and practices of religion that exist among the people apart from and alongside the strictly theological and liturgical forms of the official religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=14}}

Yoder described "folk religion" as existing "in a complex society in relation to and in tension with the organized religion(s) of that society. Its relatively unorganized character differentiates it from organized religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=11}}

Alternately, the sociologist of religion [[Matthias Zic Varul]] defined "folk religion" as "the relatively un-reflected aspect of ordinary practices and beliefs that are oriented towards, or productive of, something beyond the immediate here-and-now: everyday transcendence".{{sfn|Varul|2015|p=449}}

===Historical development===

In Europe the study of "folk religion" emerged from the study of ''religiöse Volkskund'', a German term which was used in reference to "the religious dimension of folk-culture, or the folk-cultural dimension of religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=2}} This term was first employed by a German [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] preacher, [[Paul Drews]], in a 1901 article that he published which was titled "''Religiöse Volkskunde, eine Aufgabe der praktischen Theologie''". This article was designed to be read by young Lutheran preachers leaving the seminary, to equip them for the popular variants of Lutheranism that they would encounter among their congregations and which would differ from the official, doctrinal Lutheranism that they had been accustomed to.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=2&amp;ndash;3}} Although developing within a religious environment, the term came to be adopted by German academics in the field of [[folkloristics]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=3}} During the 1920s and 1930s, theoretical studies of ''religiöse Volkskund'' had been produced by the folklorists [[Josef Weigert]], [[Werner Boette]], and [[Max Rumpf]], all of whom had focused on religiosity within German peasant communities.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=3}} Over the coming decades, [[Georg Schreiber]] established an Institut für religiöse Volkskund in [[Munich]] while a similar department was established in [[Salzburg]] by [[Hanns Koren]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=3&amp;ndash;4}} Other prominent academics involved in the study of the phenomenon were [[Heinrich Schauert]] and [[Rudolf Kriss]], the latter of whom collected one of the largest collections of folk-religious art and material culture in Europe, later housed in Munich's [[Bayerisches Nationalmuseum]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=3&amp;ndash;4}} Throughout the 20th century, many studies were made of folk religion in Europe, paying particular attention to such subjects as [[pilgrimage]] and the use of [[shrines]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=3}}

In the Americas, the study of folk religion developed among [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] studying the syncretistic cultures of the Caribbean and Latin America.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} The pioneer in this field was Redfield, whose 1930 book ''Tepoztlán: A Mexican Village'' contrasted and examined the relationship between "folk religion" and "official religion" in a peasant community.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} Yoder later noted that although the earliest known usage of the term "folk religion" in the English language was unknown, it probably developed as a translation of the German ''Volksreligion''.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} One of the earliest prominent usages of the term was in the title of [[Joshua Trachtenberg]]'s 1939 work ''Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion''.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} The term also gained increasing usage within the academic field of [[comparative religion]], appearing in the titles of [[Ichiro Hori]]'s ''Folk Religion in Japan'', [[Martin Nilsson]]'s ''Greek Folk Religion'', and [[Charles Miller Leslie|Charles Leslie]]'s reader, the ''Anthropology of Folk Religion''.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} Courses on the study of folk religion came to be taught at various universities in the United States, such as [[John Messenger]]'s at [[Indiana University]] and [[Don Yoder]]'s at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}}
Although the subject of folk religion fell within the remit of scholars operating in both folkloristics and religious studies, by 1974 Yoder noted that U.S.-based academics in the latter continued to largely ignore it, instead focusing on the study of [[theology]] and institutionalised religion; he contrasted this with the situation in Europe, where historians of religion had devoted much time to studying folk religiosity.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=6}} He also lamented that many U.S.-based folklorists also neglected the subject of religion because it did not fit within the standard genre-based system for cataloguing folklore.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=9}}

The term "folk religion" came to be increasingly rejected in the 1990s and 2000s by scholars seeking more precise terminology.{{sfn|Kapaló|2013|p=4}}

===Problems and critique===

Yoder noted that one problem with the use of the term "folk religion" was that it did not fit into the work of those scholars who used the term "religion" in reference solely to [[organized religion]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=10}} He highlighted the example of the prominent sociologist of religion [[Émile Durkheim]], who insisted that "religion" was organized in order to contrast it with "[[magic (paranormal)|magic]]".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=10}} Yoder noted that scholars adopting these perspectives often preferred the term "folk belief" over "folk religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=10}}

A second problem with the use of "folk religion" that Yoder highlighted was that some scholars, particularly those operating in the [[sociology of religion]], used the term as a synonym for [[ethnic religion]] (which is alternately known as national religion or tribal religion), meaning a religion closely tied to a particular ethnic or national group and is thus contrasted with a "universal religion" which cuts across ethnic and national boundaries.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=10&amp;ndash;11}} Among the scholars to have adopted this use of terminology are E. Wilbur Bock.{{sfn|Bock|1966|p=204}}

The folklorist Leonard Norman Primiano argued that the use of "folk religion", as well as related terms like "popular religion" and "unofficial religion", by scholars, does "an extreme disservice" to the forms of religiosity that scholarship is examining, because &amp;ndash; in his opinion &amp;ndash; such terms are "residualistic, [and] derogatory".{{sfn|Primiano|1995|p=38}} He argued that using such terminology implies that there is "a pure element" to religion "which is in some way transformed, even contaminated, by its exposure to human communities".{{sfn|Primiano|1995|p=39}} As a corrective, he suggested that scholars use "vernacular religion" as an alternative.{{sfn|Primiano|1995|pp=41&amp;ndash;42}} Defining this term, Primiano stated that "vernacular religion" is, "by definition, religion as it is lived: as human beings encounter, understand, interpret, and practice it. Since religion inherently involves interpretation, it is impossible for the religion of an individual not to be vernacular".{{sfn|Primiano|1995|p=44}}

Kapaló was critical of this approach, deeming it "mistaken" and arguing that switching from "folk religion" to "vernacular religion" results in the scholar "picking up a different selection of things from the world".{{sfn|Kapaló|2013|p=9}} He cautioned that both terms were "ideological and semantic load[ed]" and warned scholars to pay attention to the associations that each word had.{{sfn|Kapaló|2013|pp=15&amp;ndash;16}}

==Chinese folk religion==
[[Chinese folk religion]] or Shenism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GBdX2ELnkXQC&amp;pg=PA21 |title= Reinventing Chinese Syncretic Religion: Shenism |publisher= Google |date = 2007-02-23 |accessdate= 2011-11-20|isbn= 9789812308658 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.straitstimes.com/2009/9/7/how-we-came-to-pai-shen | title = How we came to ‘pai shen’ | publisher = Straits times | date = 2009-09-07 | accessdate = 2011-11-20 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111207225051/http://blogs.straitstimes.com/2009/9/7/how-we-came-to-pai-shen/ | archivedate = 2011-12-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9MmNaNebFD8C&amp;pg=PA198 |title = Religious Diversity in Singapore |publisher = Google |date = 2001-09-11 | accessdate =2011-11-20|isbn = 9789812307545 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are labels used to describe the collection of [[ethnic religion|ethnic religious]] traditions which have historically comprised the predominant belief system in [[China]] and among [[Han Chinese]] ethnic groups up to the present day. Shenism describes [[Chinese mythology]] and includes the worship of ''[[Shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'' ([[spirit]], [[Deity|god]], [[awareness]], [[consciousness]]) which can be [[nature god|nature deities]], [[Taizu (disambiguation)|Taizu]] or clan deities, [[city god]]s, [[national god|national deities]], [[culture hero]]es and [[demigod]]s, [[Chinese dragon|dragons]] and [[veneration of the dead|ancestors]]. "Shenism" as a term was first published by AJA Elliot in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = High beam | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-126163460.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese folk religion is sometimes categorized with [[Taoism]], since over the centuries institutional Taoism has been attempting to assimilate or administrate local religions. More accurately, Taoism can be defined as a branch of Shenism, since it sprang out of folk religion and [[Chinese philosophy]]. Chinese folk religion is sometimes seen as a constituent part of Chinese traditional religion, but more often, the two are regarded as synonymous.  With around 454 million adherents, or about 6.6% of the world population,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Religion | year = 2011 | title = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese folk religion is one of the [[major religious groups|major religious traditions in the world]]. In [[People's Republic of China|China]] more than 30% of the population adheres to Shenism or Taoism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://chartsbin.com/view/sgx |title=Chinese Folk Religion Adherents by Country |publisher=Charts bin |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate = 2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folk Islam==
{{further |Islamic mythology|Druze|Alevi|Alawi|Kebatinan|Abangan|Adat}}
Folk Islam is an [[umbrella term]] used to collectively describe forms of [[Islam]] that incorporate native folk beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook|first= Chris|title = Spirituality and Psychiatry| publisher= [[RCPsych]] Publications | year = 2009 | page = 242 | isbn = 978-1-904671-71-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Folk Islam has been described as the Islam of the "urban poor, country people, and tribes",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ridgeon | first = Lloyd | title =Major World Religions: From Their Origins To The Present | publisher =[[Routledge]]|year=2003|page=280|isbn = 978-0-415-29796-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] or "High" Islam (Gellner, 1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author-link = Sinisa Malesevic | last= Malešević| first = Siniša | title = Ernest Gellner and Contemporary Social Thought|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2007|page=189|isbn = 978-0-521-70941-5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sufism]] and Sufi concepts are often integrated into Folk Islam.

Various practices and beliefs have been identified with the concept of "folk Islam". They include the following:
* belief in traditional magic systems and [[Religious ecstasy|ecstatic]] rituals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Masud| first= Muhammad Khalid |title = Islam and Modernity: Key Issues and Debates| publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|year= 2009 | page = 138 | isbn = 978-0-7486-3793-5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Makris | first =JP |title= Islam in the Middle East: A Living Tradition |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|year=2006|page=49|isbn = 978-1-4051-1603-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folk Judaism==
In one of the first major academic works on the subject, titled ''Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion'', Joshua Trachtenberg provided a definition of Jewish folk religion as consisting of ideas and practices that whilst not meeting with the approval of religious leaders enjoyed wide popularity such that they must be included in what he termed the field of religion.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion'', Joshua Trachtenberg, 1939, Forgotten Books, Preface, pg xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; This included unorthodox beliefs about demons and angels, and magical practices.

Later studies have emphasized the significance of the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] to the many Jewish folk customs linked to mourning and in particular to the belief in ''hibbut ha-qever''  (torture of the grave) a belief that the dead are tortured in their grave for three days after burial by demons until they remember their names. This idea began with early eschatalogical [[aggadah]] and was then further developed by the kabbalists.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion'', Edited by Adele Berlin,  Oxford University Press, 2011, pg 344,&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Raphael Patai has been acknowledged as one of the first to utilize anthropology to study Jewish folk religion.&lt;ref&gt;''Fields of Offerings: Studies in Honor of Raphael Patai'',
by Victor D. Sanua, pg 28&lt;/ref&gt; In particular he has drawn attention to the important role of the female divine element,&lt;ref&gt;''Fields of Offerings: Studies in Honor of Raphael Patai'', by Victor D. Sanua, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1983, pg 27&lt;/ref&gt; which he sees in the goddess [[Asherah]], the [[Shekhinah]], the [[Matronit]], and [[Lilith]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fields of Offerings: Studies in Honor of Raphael Patai'', by Victor D. Sanua, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1983, pg 2&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Writer Stephen Sharot has stated that Jewish popular religion in common with other forms of folk religion, has a focus on the [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]], or [[Thaumaturgy|thaumaturgical]], i.e. it is used to assist in protecting the individual from sickness, and misfortune.  He emphasizes that while Rabbinical Judaism dealt with orthodox Jewish ritual, and [[halakah]], magicians claimed to use unorthodox magical rituals to help people in everyday life.  He points to the example of a relatively professionalised type of magician being the [[Baal Shem|ba'al shem]] of Poland, who beginning in the 16th century thrived with the popularity of practical kabbalah in the 18th century.  These ba'al shem promised to use their knowledge of the names of god, and the angels, along with exorcism, chiromancy, and [[herbal medicine]] to bring harm to enemies, and  success in areas of social life such as marriage, and childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;''Comparative Perspectives on Judaisms and Jewish Identities'', By Stephen Sharot, Wayne State University Press, 2011, pg 58&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Liebman]] has written that the essence of the folk religion of American Jews is their social ties to one another, illustrated by the finding  that religious practices that would prevent social integration -such as a strict interpretation of  dietary laws and the Sabbath- have been abandoned, whilst the practices that are followed -such as the [[Passover seder]], social rites of passage, and the High Holy Days- are ones that strengthen Jewish family and community integration.&lt;ref&gt;''Comparative Perspectives on Judaisms and Jewish Identities'', By Stephen Sharot, Wayne State University Press, 2011, pg 152&lt;/ref&gt; Liebman described the rituals and beliefs of contemporary Jewish folk religion in his works, ''The Ambivalent American Jew'' (1973) and ''American Jewry: Identity and Affiliation''.

==In sociology==
In [[sociology]], folk religion is often contrasted with [[elite religion]]. Folk religion is defined as the beliefs, practices, rituals and symbols originating from sources other than the religion's leadership. Folk religion in many instances is tolerated by the religion's leadership, although they may consider it an error.&lt;ref&gt;Leibman, Charles. "The Religion of the American Jew". ''The Ambivalent American Jew''. Jewish Publication Society. 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar concept is [[lived religion]], the study of religion as practiced by believers.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the peak emotional experience of chills (goose bumps or shivers) when listening to music involves psychophysiological arousal and a rewarding effect. However, many aspects of peak emotion are still not understood. The current research takes a new perspective of peak emotional response of tears (weeping, lump in the throat). A psychophysiological experiment showed that self-reported chills increased electrodermal activity and subjective arousal whereas tears produced slow respiration during heartbeat acceleration, although both chills and tears induced pleasure and deep breathing. A song that induced chills was perceived as being both happy and sad whereas a song that induced tears was perceived as sad. A tear-eliciting song was perceived as calmer than a chill-eliciting song. These results show that tears involve pleasure from sadness and that they are psychophysiologically calming; thus, psychophysiological responses permit the distinction between chills and tears.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;Because such chills are a clear, discrete event and have the advantage of being elicited by music in emotion research, previous studies have examined the psychophysiological responses to music chills by measuring autonomic nervous system activity. To date, empirical studies have repeatedly shown that music chills are accompanied by increasing electrodermal activity (EDA) due to activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS&lt;sup&gt;10,11,12,13,14&lt;/sup&gt;). Further, a recent study suggested that chills are associated with enlarged pupil diameter, and there exists a positive relationship between chills and SNS activity&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;. Brain-imaging studies have also suggested that chills activate reward-related brain regions, such as the ventral striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex&lt;sup&gt;16,17&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, music chills are accompanied by rewarding dopamine release in the caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens in the striatum&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, the experience of chills seems to produce physiological arousal and reward for the listener.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tingling neuropsychophysiology"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tihanyi BT, Ferentzi E, Beissner F, Köteles F | title = The neuropsychophysiology of tingling | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 97–110 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29096941 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2017.10.015 | url = | quote = In this paper, we will review the current scientific knowledge on a special skin related sensation, tingling. The term refers to an altered sensation localized on the surface of the skin, which is not related to pain and thermal sensations. We have chosen this broad and somewhat vague description because tingling is a private qualia-type experience, which cannot be easily verbalized and communicated (Jackson, 1982). Therefore, tingling is an umbrella term that covers various sensations.&lt;br /&gt;Medicine places tingling under the general term paresthesia, i.e. sensations of a person's body with no apparent physical cause (NINDS, 2017).&amp;nbsp;... Tingling is linked to a variety of affective states connected with positive excitement and the feeling of being energized (Ayan, 2005; Bathmaker &amp; Avis, 2005; Gould, 1991). It was also associated with elevation, i.e. a pleasant positive moral emotion triggered by witnessing acts of human moral virtue (Haidt, 2003).&amp;nbsp;... As tingling or chills have been linked to a wide range of emotions, both positive and negative, as well as general arousal, it was suggested that they consist of at least two independent factors: tingling-goosebumps and cold-shiver. While the former is related to greater surprise, enjoyment and approach motivation, the latter is linked to disgust, fear, sadness, and avoidance motivation (Maruskin, Thrash, &amp; Elliot, 2012).&amp;nbsp;... The actual mechanisms behind affect-related tingling might be better illuminated by the deeply researched example of hedonic experiences. Emotional peak experiences are often accompanied by tingling or chills. Within this category, music appears to be the most frequent trigger of chills, experienced mostly at the neck and the arms (Harrison &amp; Loui, 2014).&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;A related phenomenon is the recently described autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) (Barratt &amp; Davis, 2015). It is characterized by a static tingling sensation originating from the back of the head, then propagating to the neck, shoulder, arm, spine, and legs, which makes people feel relaxed and alert. Similar to chills, it can be triggered by a variety of external stimuli, but also by internal triggers, such as focusing attention, recalling the memory of a previous ASMR, meditating, or changes of mood or state of mind. It is also connected to the experience of intimacy, flow, or mindfulness (Kobayashi, 2015).&lt;br /&gt;Concerning the nervous system background, a neuroimaging study has shown that the intensity of chills correlated with activity of the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex (i.e., the centers of the reward circuitry), insula, and anterior cingulum (Blood &amp; Zatorre, 2001). It is possible that the emotional involvement evokes sympathetic arousal, which in turn is perceived as a tingling sensation (Grewe et al., 2010). The hypothesis that pleasant tingling is caused by emotional processes, and not the other way around, is supported by the fact that most people experiencing ASMR reported positive emotions during listening to music even in the absence of tingling (Barratt &amp; Davis, 2015).}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sensation commonly occurs as a mildly to moderately [[Euphoria#Music euphoria|pleasurable emotional response to music]] with skin tingling;&lt;ref name="pmid25101043" /&gt; piloerection and pupil dilation do not necessarily occur in all cases.&lt;ref name="Scientific Reports" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tingling neuropsychophysiology" /&gt; The psychological component (i.e., the pleasurable feeling) and physiological components (i.e., parasthesia, piloerection, and pupil dilation) of the response are mediated by the [[reward system]] and [[sympathetic nervous system]], respectively.&lt;ref name="Scientific Reports" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tingling neuropsychophysiology" /&gt; The stimuli that produce this response are unique to each individual.

Frisson is of short duration, lasting only a few seconds.&lt;ref name="ohio-state" /&gt; Typical stimuli include loud passages of music and passages—such as [[Appoggiatura|appoggiaturas]] and sudden [[modulation (music)|modulation]]—that violate some level of musical expectation.&lt;ref name="pmid24552785"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koelsch S | title = Brain correlates of music-evoked emotions | journal = Nature Reviews.

Experimental studies have also shown that tingling during frisson is accompanied by increased [[electrodermal activity]] (skin conductance) – which is mediated via the activation of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] – and that the intensity of tingling is positively correlated with the magnitude of sympathetic activation.&lt;ref name="Scientific Reports" /&gt; 
Frisson is also associated with piloerection, [[mydriasis|enlarged pupil diameter]], and physiological arousal, all of which are mediated by activation of the sympathetic nervous system.&lt;ref name="Scientific Reports" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tingling neuropsychophysiology" /&gt;

Neuroimaging studies have found that the intensity of tingling is positively correlated with the magnitude of brain activity in specific regions of the [[reward system]], including the [[nucleus accumbens]], [[orbitofrontal cortex]], and [[insular cortex]].&lt;ref name="Scientific Reports" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tingling neuropsychophysiology" /&gt; All three of these brain structures are known to contain a [[hedonic hotspot]], a region of the brain that is responsible for producing pleasure [[cognition]].&lt;ref name="Pleasure system"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berridge KC, Kringelbach ML | title = Pleasure systems in the brain | journal = Neuron | volume = 86 | issue = 3 | pages = 646–664 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25950633 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2015.02.018 | quote = In the prefrontal cortex, recent evidence indicates that the [orbitofrontal cortex] OFC and insula cortex may each contain their own additional hot spots (D.C. Castro et al., Soc. Neurosci., abstract). In specific subregions of each area, either opioid-stimulating or orexin-stimulating microinjections appear to enhance the number of ''liking'' reactions elicited by sweetness, similar to the [nucleus accumbens] NAc and [ventral pallidum] VP hot spots. Successful confirmation of hedonic hot spots in the OFC or insula would be important and possibly relevant to the orbitofrontal mid-anterior site mentioned earlier that especially tracks the subjective pleasure of foods in humans (Georgiadis et al., 2012; Kringelbach, 2005; Kringelbach et al., 2003; Small et al., 2001; Veldhuizen et al., 2010). Finally, in the brainstem, a hindbrain site near the parabrachial nucleus of dorsal pons also appears able to contribute to hedonic gains of function (Söderpalm and Berridge, 2000). A brainstem mechanism for pleasure may seem more surprising than forebrain hot spots to anyone who views the brainstem as merely reflexive, but the pontine parabrachial nucleus contributes to taste, pain, and many visceral sensations from the body and has also been suggested to play an important role in motivation (Wu et al., 2012) and in human emotion (especially related to the somatic marker hypothesis) (Damasio, 2010). | pmc=4425246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mapping brain circuits"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richard JM, Castro DC, Difeliceantonio AG, Robinson MJ, Berridge KC | title = Mapping brain circuits of reward and motivation: in the footsteps of Ann Kelley | journal = Neurosci.

The '''gay panic defense&lt;ref&gt;''Gay panic defence'' in UK and NZ. Also known as the ''homosexual advance defence'' strategy in Australia. See [[American and British English differences]].&lt;/ref&gt;''' is an attempted legal defense, usually against charges of [[assault]] or [[murder]]. A defendant using the defense claims they acted in a state of violent [[Insanity defense|temporary insanity]] because of unwanted same-sex sexual advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chuang HT, Addington D.|date=October 1988|title=Homosexual panic: a review of its concept|journal=[[The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry]]|volume=33|issue=7|pages=613–7|pmid=3197016|doi=10.1177/070674378803300707}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defendant alleges to find the same-sex sexual advances so offensive and frightening that it brings on a psychotic state characterized by unusual violence.

'''Trans panic''' is a similar defense applied in cases of assault, manslaughter, or murder of a [[transgender]] individual, with whom the assailant(s) engaged in sexual relations unaware that the victim is transgender until seeing them naked, or further into or post sexual activity.

==Jurisdictions==
===Australia===
In Australia, it is known as the homosexual advance defense (HAD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/clrd/ll_clrd.nsf/vwPrint1/CLRD_had|title=Homosexual Advance Defence: Final Report of the Working Party|date=September 1998|accessdate=7 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027130927/http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/clrd/ll_clrd.nsf/vwPrint1/CLRD_had|archivedate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[The Australian]]''|date=23 October 1995|title=Gay rally puts 'panic defence' on trial|author=Amanda Meade}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the status of the HAD in Australia, Kent Blore wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Although the homosexual advance defence cannot be found anywhere in legislation, its entrenchment in case law gives it the force of law. [...] Several Australian states and territories have either abolished the umbrella defence of provocation entirely or excluded non-violent homosexual advances from its ambit. Of those that have abolished provocation entirely, Tasmania was the first to do so in 2003.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Homosexual Advance Defence and the Campaign to Abolish it in Queensland: The Activist's Dilemma and the Politician's Paradox|author=Kent Blore|journal=QUT Law &amp; Justice Journal|volume=12|number=2|year=2012|url=https://lr.law.qut.edu.au/article/view/489|doi=10.5204/qutlr.v12i2.489}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] passed similar reforms in 2005, followed by [[Western Australia]] in 2008 and [[Queensland]] in 2017 (with a clause to allow it in 'exceptional circumstances' to be determined by a magistrate).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/gay-panic-laws-pass-queensland-parliament-removing-partial-defence-20170321-gv32j8.html|title=Gay panic laws pass Queensland Parliament, removing partial defence|last=Caldwell|first=Felicity|work=Brisbane Times|access-date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a differing approach, [[New South Wales]], the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] and [[Northern Territory]] have implemented changes to stipulate that non-violent sexual advances (of any kind, including homosexual) aren't a valid defence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[South Australia]] was the first Australian jurisdiction to legalise consensual homosexual acts in 1975; however, {{As of|April 2017|lc=y}} it was the only Australian jurisdiction not to have repealed or overhauled the gay panic defence.&lt;ref name="SALRI Report"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Provoking Operation of Provocation |url=https://law.adelaide.edu.au/research/law-reform-institute/documents/provocation_stage_1_report.pdf |publisher=South Australian Law Reform Institute |accessdate=9 March 2018 |date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the South Australian state government was awaiting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timebase.com.au/news/2017/AT04291-article.html|title=Overview of Homosexual Advance Defence Laws Across Australia: South Australia Still to Enact Change|date=5 July 2017|work=Time Base|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-22/sa-becomes-last-state-to-allow-gay-panic-defence/8376948.html|title=South Australia Becomes Last State to Allow Gay Panic Defence for Murder|last=Jones|first=Ruby|date=22 March 2017|work=ABC News|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the report from the South Australian Law Reform Institute and the outcome of the appeal to the High Court from the Court of Criminal Appeal of South Australia. In 2011 Andrew Negre was killed by Michael Lindsay bashing and stabbing him. Lindsay's principle defence was that he stabbed Negre in the chest and abdomen but Negre's death was the result of someone else slitting Negre's throat. The secondary defence was that Lindsay's action in stabbing Negre was because he had lost self-control after Negre made sexual advances towards him and offered to pay Lindsay for sex. The jury convicted Lindsay of murder and he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 23-year non-parole period. The Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the conviction finding that the directions to the jury on the gay panic defence were flawed, but that every reasonable jury would have found that an ordinary person could not have to lost self-control and acted in the way Lindsay did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|SASCFC|56|2014|litigants=R v Lindsay |date=3 June 2014 |courtname=[[Supreme Court of South Australia|Court of Criminal Appeal]] (SA, Australia)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court held that a properly instructed jury might have found that an offer of money for sex made by a Caucasian man to an Aboriginal man in the latter's home and in the presence of his wife and family may have had a pungency that an unwelcome sexual advance made by one man toward another in other circumstances would not have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|17|2015|litigants=Lindsay v the Queen}} {{cite web |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2015/hca-16-2015-05-06.pdf |title=judgment summary |publisher=[[High Court of Australia]] |date=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsay was re-tried and was again convicted of murder.

===New Zealand===
* In 2003, a gay interior designer and former television host, David McNee, was killed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3515038|title=Homicide detectives continue inquiry into designer's death|publisher=NZ Herald News|date=28 July 2003|accessdate=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a part-time sex worker, Phillip Layton Edwards.

====Uses of the defense====
The gay panic defense is generally invoked in cases where the guilt of the defendant is unquestioned, but only to strengthen a more "traditional criminal law defense such as insanity, diminished capacity, provocation, or self-defense" and is not meant to provide justification of the crime on its own.&lt;ref name=Lee2008/&gt; While using the gay panic defense to explain insanity has typically not been successful in winning a complete acquittal, diminished capacity, provocation, and self-defense have all been used successfully to reduce charges and sentences.&lt;ref name=Lee2008/&gt; Historically, in US courts, use of the gay panic defense has not typically resulted in the acquittal of the defendant; instead, the defendant was usually found guilty, but on lesser charges, or judges and juries may have cited homosexual solicitation as a mitigating factor, resulting in reduced culpability and sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bottoms.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Salerno-Najdowski-bottoms-kemner-dave-harrington-2014-Gay-Panic-PPPL.pdf |title=Excusing Murder? Conservative Jurors' Acceptance of the Gay-panic defense|author1=Salerno, Jessica M.|author2=Najdowski, Cynthia J.|author3=Harrington, Evan|author4=Kemner, Gretchen|author5=Dave, Reetu|date=April 2016|publisher=University of Illinois at Chicago|accessdate=22 March 2017|quote=The gay-panic defense is a specific type of provocation defense in which the defendant claims that the crime in question was the result of a sudden and intense passion provoked by the victim’s unwanted same-gender sexual advance. It is primarily used by straight men claiming that they found the experience of an unwanted same-gender sexual advance so upsetting that they temporarily became enraged and lost control of their own behavior (Lee, 2008). Chen (2000) argues that the acceptance of a gay-panic defense implies acceptance of a nonviolent same-gender sexual advance as an adequate trigger to cause a person to fall into an uncontrollable state of panic. If jurors collectively agree that the reaction was reasonable, they can find the defendant guilty of a lesser offense, which often results in a lesser sentence (Lee, 2008).}}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous case in which this occurred was the "[[Jenny Jones (presenter)|Jenny Jones]]" case, in which Jonathan Schmitz was tried for the first-degree murder of Scott Amedure and was instead found guilty of the lesser offense of second-degree murder.&lt;ref name=PeoplevSchmitz/&gt; Some instances where the gay panic defense has been invoked include:

* In August 1954, William T. Simpson, a 27-year-old [[flight attendant|air steward]] for [[Eastern Air Lines]], was murdered by Charles W. Lawrence and Lewis Richard Killen in a "[[lovers' lane]]" area of [[North Miami, Florida]]. For months, Lawrence had been posing as a [[hitchhiking|hitchhiker]] on [[Biscayne Boulevard]]; after he was picked up, Killen would trail the car in a green Chevrolet and rob the driver who had picked up Lawrence. During the course of the investigation, Milt Sosin, a reporter for ''[[The Miami News]]'', wrote that Lawrence and Killen had chosen the area deliberately to target homosexual victims. Lawrence confessed to shooting Simpson while "resisting his advances" and stated that "Simpson started to get nervous ... I didn't mean to shoot him.

* James Bierley was stabbed to death by Robert James Thornton on January 8, 1970 in [[Columbia, Missouri]]. Bierley and Thornton were neighbors residing in the same apartment building; in a statement he gave four days later, Thornton said he had been drinking when Bierley invited him upstairs to his room to watch television. After watching for half an hour, in Thornton's statement, "[Bierley] started playing with me and put his arm around me ... he started kissing me on the jaw ... I told him three or four times to quit what he was doing and he just kept on like he didn't hear me." When Thornton attempted to leave, Bierley grabbed him and pulled him back into the room, where Thornton felt "that he was trying to queer me and I just blew up and started stabbing him.

The Appeals Court rejected the defense that Thornton was in a state of "homosexual panic" as the pair had been sitting in a small room together with the door open, there were no signs of a physical struggle, Bierley had no weapon and according to Thornton's statement, had not made any threats, and no other residents reported unusual noises or shouts.&lt;ref name="532SW2d37"/&gt;

Shelley visited Dubbels at his home with some friends near midnight on September 2 and after drinking and joking for several hours, the friends departed, leaving Shelley and Dubbels alone. At some point during the evening, Dubbels had expressed his physical attraction to Shelley, but it was not taken seriously in the joking context of the gathering; after they were alone, Dubbels suggested that Shelley spend the rest of the night to help him open the store in the morning. Shelley agreed, and after taking a shower, got into bed with Dubbels. Dubbels made sexual advances, but was rebuffed. Shelley, upset, went downstairs to retrieve a meat cleaver and roasting fork from the kitchen. After returning to the upstairs bedroom, Dubbels reportedly put his arm around Shelley, and Shelley responded by attacking and killing Dubbels.

When Williamson dropped his lighter, he felt a gun, and Dunkin proceeded to drive Williamson at gunpoint to a remote area where he attempted to force Williamson to perform fellatio, which Williamson resisted.

When Lang pushed him away angrily, Anderson turned his back on Lang and swung his rifle down from his shoulder; Lang was fearful that Anderson was loading the rifle, so he shot Anderson with a handgun he owned and was carrying.&lt;ref name="782P2d627"/&gt; During rebuttal, the prosecution presented testimony from Lang's former roommate, a known homosexual who had propositioned Lang without a violent reaction. Lang was convicted of first-degree murder and robbery with the special circumstance where the murder was committed in perpetration of the robbery, and he was sentenced to death. The Supreme Court of California, in upholding the verdict, found that remarks attributed to Anderson by Lang about venereal disease were characteristic of a certain subgroup of homosexuals who had very few sexual contacts with men and a morbid fear of venereal disease. Because this subgroup was not widely known, it was likely that Lang himself was part of that subgroup.&lt;ref name="782P2d627"/&gt;

Schmitz confessed to committing the crime but claimed that Amedure's homosexual overtures angered and humiliated him. In cases of legal [[provocation (legal)|provocation]] providing for diminished capacity, it is required that the provocation have an immediate response.

* In the 1998 murder of university student [[Matthew Shepard]], the defendants claimed in court that the young man's homosexual proposition enraged them to the point of murder. However, Judge Barton Voigt barred this strategy, saying that it was "in effect, either a temporary insanity defense or a diminished capacity defense, such as irresistible impulse, which are not allowed in [[Wyoming]], because they do not fit within the statutory insanity defense construct." After their conviction, Shepard's attackers recanted their story in a ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]'' interview with [[Elizabeth Vargas]], saying that the murder was a robbery attempt gone awry under the influence of drugs.

'''Giulio Paolini''' (born 5 November 1940) is an [[Italy|Italian]] artist associated with both [[Arte Povera]] and [[Conceptual Art]].&lt;ref name=Nota1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazionepaolini.it/biografia.php |title= Biography |publisher= Artist's official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Paolini was born in [[Genoa]]. After a childhood spent in [[Bergamo]], he moved with his family to [[Turin]] where he still lives today. He attended the Giambattista Bodoni State Industrial Technical School of Graphics and Photography, graduating in the Graphics department in 1959. He had been interested in [[visual arts|art]] from an early age, visiting museums and galleries and reading art periodicals. Towards the end of the 1950s he approached [[painting]], trying some pictures of an abstract nature, close to [[monochrome]]. The discovery of [[Graphic design|modern graphics]] during his studies and the fact that there were architecture magazines around the house – his elder brother Cesare (1937–1983) was an architect – contributed to orienting him towards a line of research aimed at zeroing the image.

He did his first work in 1960, ''Disegno geometrico'' (''Geometrical Drawing''), which consists of the squaring in ink of a canvas painted with white tempera. This preliminary gesture of any representation whatever would remain the point of “eternal recurrence” in the universe of Paolini’s thought: topical moment and original instant that revealed the artist to himself, representing the conceptual foundation of all his future work.

In the early 1960s, Paolini developed his research by focusing on the very components of the picture: on the painter’s tools and on the space of representation. For his first solo show – in 1964 at Gian Tommaso Liverani’s La Salita gallery in [[Rome]] – he presented some rough wooden panels leant against or hanging on the wall, suggesting an exhibition in the process of being set up. The show was seen by Carla Lonzi and Marisa Volpi who would shortly afterwards write the first critical texts on the young artist. In 1965 Paolini began to use photography, which allowed him to extend his inquiry to the relationship between artist and work (''Delfo'', 1965; ''1421965'', 1965). In the same year, through Carla Lonzi, he met [[Luciano Pistoi]], owner of the Galleria Notizie in Turin, who introduced him to a new circle of friends and collectors and became his main dealer until the beginning of the 1970s.

Between 1967 and 1972, the critic [[Germano Celant]] invited him to take part in [[Arte Povera]] exhibitions which resulted in his name being associated with that movement. In fact Paolini’s position was clearly distinct from the vitalistic climate and “existential phenomenology” that distinguished the propositions of Celant’s artists. He repeatedly declared an intimate belonging to the history of art, identifying programmatically with the lineage of all the artists who had preceded him. Some of his best known works can be traced back to this purpose, extraneous to the militant scene of the late 1960s: ''Giovane che guarda Lorenzo Lotto'' (''Young Man Looking at Lorenzo Lotto'', 1967), the “self-portraits” from Poussin and Rousseau (1968) and the pictures in which he reproduces details of old masters’ paintings (''L’ultimo quadro di Diego Velázquez'', 1968; ''Lo studio'', 1968). Among Paolini’s main references in those years were [[Jorge Luis Borges]], to whom he paid homage on several occasions, and [[Giorgio de Chirico]] from whom he borrowed the constituent phrase of the work ''Et.quid.amabo.nisi.quod.ænigma est'' (1969).

His first official acknowledgements came with the 1970s: from shows abroad, which placed him on the international avant-garde gallery circuit, to his first museum exhibitions. In 1970 he took part in the [[Venice Biennale]] with ''Elegia'' (''Elegy'', 1969), the first work in which he used the [[plaster cast]] of a [[classical antiquity|classic]] subject: the eye of Michelangelo’s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' with a fragment of mirror applied to the pupil. One of the outstanding themes in this decade was a backward glance at his own work: from literal citation of celebrated paintings he arrived at self-citation, proposing a historicizing in perspective of his oeuvre. Works such as ''La visione è simmetrica?'' (''Is Vision Symmetrical?'', 1972) or ''Teoria delle apparenze'' (''Theory of Appearances'', 1972) allude to the idea of the picture as potential container of all past and future works. Another theme investigated with particular interest in this period was that of the double and the copy, which found expression above all in the group of works entitled ''Mimesi'' (''Mimesis'', 1975–76) consisting of two plaster casts of the same classical statue set face to face, calling into question the concept of [[mimesis|reproduction]] and representation itself.

The period most dense in exhibitions and retrospectives, with the publication of important monographs, was the 1980s. In the first half of the decade an explicitly theatrical dimension began to establish itself with works marked by fragmentation and dispersion (''La caduta di Icaro'', 1982; ''Melanconia ermetica'', 1983) or distinguished by theatrical figures such as eighteenth century valets de chambre (''Trionfo della rappresentazione'', 1984). Paolini’s poetics was considerably enriched by literary attributions and [[Mythology|mythological]] references, as well as by the introduction of cosmic images. In the late 1980s the artist's reflections turned mainly on the very act of exhibiting. Starting with his solo show at the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes|Musée des Beaux-Arts]] in Nantes (1987) the concept of the exhibition – its premises and its promises – became progressively configured as the actual subject of the works themselves.

In the course of the 1990s, further inquiry into the idea of exhibiting spread into other, new modalities. The increasingly complex set-ups often followed a typology that was additive (seriality, juxtaposition) or centrifugal (dispersion or dissemination from a central nucleus) or centripetal (concentration and implosive superimposition). The place of the exhibition became the stage par excellence of the “theatre of the opus”, meaning of the work in its doing and undoing: the place that defined the very eventuality of its happening (''Esposizione universale'', 1992; ''Teatro dell’opera'', 1993; ''Essere o non essere'', 1995). Completion of the work was moreover constantly deferred, leaving the spectator in perennial expectation: just what the artist always feels from the start at his worktable, waiting for the work to manifest itself.

In the 2000s, another theme especially dear to Paolini took on special importance, as much in his artwork as in his writings: the identity of the author, his condition as spectator, his lack of contact with a work that always precedes and supersedes him.

Paolini’s poetics and artistic practice as a whole may be characterised as a self-reflective meditation on the dimension of art, on its timeless “classicality” and its perspective without vanishing point. By means of [[photography]], [[collage]], [[plaster cast]]s and [[drawing]] his intention is always to inquire, with great conceptual rigour, into the tautological and at the same time metaphysical nature of artistic practice.&lt;ref name=Nota1/&gt;

==Exhibitions==
[[File:Paolini - 'L'Altra Figura' (1984).jpg|thumb|''L'Altra Figura'' (1984) in the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]]]]
Since his first solo show ([[Rome]], 1964) Paolini has exhibited in art galleries and museums worldwide. Collaboration with avant-garde Italian galleries of the 1960s and 1970s (La Salita, [[Rome]]; Galleria Notizie, [[Turin]]; Galleria dell'Ariete, [[Milan]]; Galleria del Leone, [[Venice]]; La Tartaruga, [[Rome]]; L'Attico, Rome; Studio Marconi, [[Milan]]; Modern Art Agency, [[Naples]]) was swiftly integrated with regular presence in important foreign galleries (from 1971 Paul Maenz, [[Cologne]]; from 1972 [[Ileana Sonnabend|Sonnabend]], [[New York City]]; from 1973 Annemarie Verna, [[Zurich]]; from 1976 [[Yvon Lambert Gallery|Yvon Lambert]], [[Paris]]; from 1977 [[Lisson Gallery]], [[London]]). Since the 1980s Paolini has mainly been represented by the galleries Christian Stein, [[Milan]]; Massimo Minini, [[Brescia]]; Alfonso Artiaco, [[Naples]]; [[Yvon Lambert Gallery|Yvon Lambert]], [[Paris]] and Marian Goodman, [[New York City]].

The great anthological exhibitions took off towards the late 1970s (Istituto di Storia dell'Arte dell'Università di Parma, [[Parma]], 1976; Städtisches Museum, [[Mönchengladbach]], 1977; Mannheimer Kunstverein, [[Mannheim]], 1977; Museo Diego Aragona Pignatelli Cortes, [[Naples]], 1978; [[Stedelijk Museum]], [[Amsterdam]], touring to The Museum of Modern Art, [[Oxford]], 1980) and culminated in the second half of the 1980s (Le Nouveau Musée, [[Villeurbanne]], 1984, touring to [[Montreal]], [[Vancouver]] and [[Charleroi]]; [[Neue Staatsgalerie|Staatsgalerie]], Stuttgart, 1986; [[Castle of Rivoli|Castello di Rivoli]], [[Rivoli (TO)|Rivoli]], 1986; [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna]], [[Rome]], 1988; Galleria Comunale d'Arte Moderna, Villa delle Rose, [[Bologna]], 1990). Outstanding recent solo shows were held in [[Graz]] (Neue Galerie im Landesmuseum Joanneum, 1998), [[Turin]] (Galleria Civica d'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea, 1999), [[Verona]] (Galleria d'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea Palazzo Forti, 2001), [[Milan]] (Fondazione Prada, 2003), [[Winterthur]] ([[Kunstmuseum Winterthur]], 2005) and [[Münster]] (Westfälisches Landesmuseum für Kunst und Kulturgeschichte, 2005). For the season 2002/2003 in the [[Vienna State Opera]] Giulio Paolini designed a large scale picture (176 sqm) as part of the exhibition series "Safety Curtain", conceived by [[museum in progress]].&lt;ref name="Safety Curtain by Giulio Paolini"&gt;[http://www.mip.at/creations/eiserner-vorhang-2002-2003 "Safety Curtain 2002/2003"], [[museum in progress]], Vienna.&lt;/ref&gt;

Group exhibitions, innumerable since his participation in the 1961 ''Premio Lissone'', include the shows connected with [[Arte Povera]] (1967–1971, 1984–85, 1997, 2001–02), the main international exhibitions of Italian art and many of the most significant shows dedicated to artistic development in the second half of the 20th century (for example: ''Vitalità del negativo'', [[Rome]] 1970; ''Contemporanea'', Rome 1973; ''Projekt '74'', [[Cologne]] 1974; ''Europe in the Seventies'', [[Chicago]] and touring through the [[United States]] 1977–78; ''Westkunst'', [[Cologne]] 1981; ''‘60–'80': Attitudes/concepts/images'', [[Amsterdam]] 1982; ''An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture'', [[New York City]] 1984; ''The European Iceberg'', [[Toronto]] 1985; ''Transformations in Sculpture'', [[New York City]] 1985; ''Bilderstreit'', [[Cologne]] 1989; ''1965–1975: Reconsidering the Object of Art'', [[Los Angeles]] 1995; ''The Last Picture Show: Artists Using Photography, 1960–82'', [[Minneapolis]] and touring 2003–05). Paolini has appeared several times at [[documenta]] Kassel (1972, 1977, 1982, 1992) and the [[Venice Biennale]] (1970, 1976, 1978, 1980, 1984, 1986, 1993, 1995, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazionepaolini.it/esposizioni_personali.php |title= Exhibitions |publisher= Artist’s official website}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Whitechapel Gallery in London staged Giulio Paolini: To Be or Not To Be, an exhibition of Paolini's sculptures, exhibitions and installations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/exhibitions/giulio-paolini-to-be-or-not-to-be/&lt;/ref&gt; "Giorgio De Chirico-Giulio Paolini Giuilo Paolini Giorgio De Chirico" Center for Italian Modern Art, Oct. 13, 2016-June 24, 2017, New York, NY, italianmodernart.org

==Set design==

In the course of his career Paolini has also worked in the [[scenic design|theatre]], from the sets and costumes for [[Vittorio Alfieri]]’s ''Bruto II'', directed by Gualtiero Rizzi (1969), to his collaboration with Carlo Quartucci and the Zattera di Babele in the 1980s. Outstanding recent projects include the sets for [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]’s [[Die Walküre]] (2005) and [[Parsifal]] (2007) at the [[Teatro di San Carlo]] in Naples, directed by Federico Tiezzi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazionepaolini.it/scenografie.php |title= Set Design |publisher= Artist’s official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bibliography==

Right from the start Paolini’s productions have been accompanied by written reflections and comments, seen as elements complementary to and parallel with the image. His first collection of texts, ''Idem'', was published by [[Giulio Einaudi|Einaudi]] in 1975 with an essay by [[Italo Calvino]]. Recent collections include ''Quattro passi. Nel museo senza muse'' (Einaudi, Turin 2006) and ''Dall'Atlante al Vuoto (in ordine alfabetico)'' published by Mondadori Electa, Milan 2010. In 1995 Maddalena Disch edited a complete edition of his writings and interviews (''Giulio Paolini: la voce del pittore. Scritti e interviste 1965–1995'', ADV Publishing House, [[Lugano]]).

The first monograph on the artist, by [[Germano Celant]], was published in 1972 in [[New York City]] by [[Ileana Sonnabend|Sonnabend Press]]. The most significant books on Giulio Paolini, including critical anthologies and a wealth of documentation, are the catalogues brought out on the occasion of his solo shows in [[Parma]] (1976), [[Ravenna]] (1985, ''Giulio Paolini. Tutto qui'', Edizioni Essegi, Ravenna), [[Stuttgart]] (1986), [[Rome]] (1988), [[Graz]] (1998) and [[Milan]] (2003). In 1990 Francesco Poli edited a monograph for Edizioni Lindau of Turin. In 1992 Marco Noire published ''Impressions graphiques. L’opera grafica 1967–1992 di Giulio Paolini'', a general catalogue of his prints and multiples. In 2008 the publisher Skira of Milan brought out a two volume Catalogue Raisonné of Paolini's works from 1960 to 1999, edited by Maddalena Disch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazionepaolini.it/bibliografia.php |title= Bibliography |publisher= Artist’s official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Holistic management''' (from {{lang|grc|ὅλος}} ''holos'', a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning ''all'', ''whole'', ''entire'', ''total'') in agriculture is a [[systems thinking]] approach to managing resources that was originally developed by [[Allan Savory]] for reversing [[desertification]].&lt;ref name="greenbiz"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coughlin|first=Chrissy|title=Allan Savory: How livestock can protect the land|url=http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2013/03/10/allan-savory-how-livestock-can-protect-land|publisher=GreenBiz|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the Africa Centre for Holistic Management in Zimbabwe, Operation Hope (a "[[proof of concept]]" project using holistic management) was named the winner of the 2010 [[Buckminster Fuller Challenge]] for "recognizing initiatives which take a comprehensive, anticipatory, design approach to radically advance human well being and the health of our planet's ecosystems".&lt;ref name="challenge"&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Challenge Winner: Operation Hope: Permanent water and food security for Africa's impoverished millions|url=http://challenge.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2010/operation-hope|publisher=bfi.org|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thackara|first=John|title=Greener Pastures|url=http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/Greener_Pastures/|publisher=Seed Magazine|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rothstein|first=Joe|title=Hang On, Planet Earth, Help Is On The Way|url=http://uspolitics.einnews.com/column/57081276/hang-on-planet-earth-help-is-on-the-way-joe-rothstein-s-commentary|publisher=EIN News|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beginnings ==
The idea of holistic planned [[grazing]] began in the 1960s when [[Allan Savory]], a wildlife biologist in his native [[Southern Rhodesia]], set out to understand [[desertification]]. This can be seen in the context of the larger [[environmental movement]]. Heavily influenced by the work of [[André Voisin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Voisin|first= André |authorlink= |title=Grass Productivity | date=1 December 1988 |origyear=1959 |publisher=Island Press |isbn=978-0933280649 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Voisin|first=André, Antoine Lecomte|title=Rational grazing, the meeting of cow and grass: a manual of grass productivity|year=1962|publisher=C. Lockwood LTD, London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ineffectiveness of mainstream [[rangeland]] science of the time, Savory concluded that the spread of deserts, the loss of wildlife, and the human impoverishment that always resulted were related to the reduction of the natural [[herds]] of large grazers and even more, the change in behavior of those few remaining herds.&lt;ref name="greenbiz" /&gt; [[Livestock]] could be substituted to provide important [[ecosystem services]] like nutrient [[Biogeochemical cycle|cycling]] when [[Biomimicry|mimicking]]&lt;ref name="Benyus 1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Benyus |first=Janine |title=Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature |year=1997 |publisher=[[William Morrow &amp; Company]], Inc. |location=New York, NY, USA |isbn=978-0-688-16099-9 |ref=Benyus97}}&lt;/ref&gt; those uniquely coevolved grasses and grazers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Retallack|first=Gregory|title=Cenozoic Expansion of Grasslands and Climatic Cooling|url=http://blogs.uoregon.edu/gregr/files/2013/07/grasslandscooling-nhslkh.pdf|work=The University of Chicago|publisher=The Journal of Geology|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Voisin|first= André |authorlink= |title=Grass Productivity | date=1 December 1988 |origyear=1959 |publisher=Island Press |isbn=978-0933280649 |page=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Undersander|first=Dan|title=Pastures for profit: A guide to rotational grazing|url=http://learningstore.uwex.edu/assets/pdfs/A3529.pdf|publisher=University of Wisconsin Extension|accessdate=5 April 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; But managers had found that while [[rotational grazing]] systems can work for diverse management purposes, scientific experiments had demonstrated that they do not necessarily work for specific [[ecological]] purposes. An adaptive management plan was needed for the integration of the [[experience|experiential]] with the [[experimental]], as well as the [[social]] with the [[biophysical]], to provide a more comprehensive framework for the management of rangeland systems.&lt;ref&gt;D. D. Briske, Nathan F. Sayre, L. Huntsinger, M. Fernandez-Gimenez, B. Budd, and J. D. Derner, Origin, Persistence, and Resolution of the Rotational Grazing Debate: Integrating Human Dimensions Into Rangeland Research, Rangeland Ecology &amp; Management 2011 64:4, 325-334&lt;/ref&gt; None of these sources of knowledge could be understood except in the context of the whole. [[holism|Holistic]] management was developed to meet that need.

== Development ==
In many regions, [[pastoralism]] and communal land use are blamed for [[human ecology|environmental]] degradation caused by [[overgrazing]]. After years of research and experience, Savory came to understand this assertion was often wrong, and that sometimes removing animals actually made it worse.&lt;ref name="challenge" /&gt; This concept is a variation of the [[trophic cascade]], where humans are seen as the top level predator and the cascade follows from there.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I have been particularly fascinated, for example, by the work of a remarkable man called Allan Savory, in Zimbabwe and other [[semi arid]] areas, who has argued for years against the prevailing expert view that is the simple numbers of cattle that drive overgrazing and cause fertile land to become desert. On the contrary, as he has since shown so graphically, the land needs the presence of feeding animals and their droppings for the cycle to be complete, so that soils and grassland areas stay productive. Such that, if you take grazers off the land and lock them away in vast [[feedlots]], the land dies. "- His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales ([[Prince Charles]]) from a speech to the IUCN World Conservation Congress&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Charles sends a message to IUCN's World Conservation Congress |url=http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/multimedia/video/?10774/Prince-Charles-sends-a-message-to-IUCNs-World-Conservation-Congress |work=International Union for Conservation of Nature |accessdate=6 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315111928/http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/multimedia/video/?10774%2FPrince-Charles-sends-a-message-to-IUCNs-World-Conservation-Congress |archivedate=15 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Savory developed a flexible management system designed to improve grazing systems. Holistic planned grazing is one of a number of newer grazing management systems that more closely simulate the behavior of natural herds of wildlife and have been shown to improve [[riparian]] habitats and water quality over systems that often led to [[land degradation]], and be an effective tool to improve range condition for both livestock and [[wildlife]].&lt;ref name="challenge" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dagget|first=Dan ; with photography by Tom Bean|title=Gardeners of Eden : rediscovering our importance to nature|year=2005|publisher=Thatcher Charitable Trust|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=9780966622911}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weber|first1=K T|last2=Gokhale|first2=B S|title=Effect of grazing on soil-water content in semiarid rangelands of southeast Idaho|url=http://giscenter.isu.edu/research/projects/jae_soilmoisture.pdf|website=Elsevier|publisher=Journal of Arid Environments|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schwartz|first=Judith D.|title=Greener Pastures|url=http://www.conservationmagazine.org/2011/06/greener-pastures/|work=Conservation Magazine|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salatin|first=Joel|title=Tall grass mob stocking|url=http://www.acresusa.com/toolbox/reprints/May08_Salatin.pdf|work=Acres USA May 2008 vol 8 no 5|accessdate=11 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111035028/http://www.acresusa.com/toolbox/reprints/May08_Salatin.pdf|archivedate=11 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.

== Framework ==
The holistic management decision-making framework uses six key steps to guide the management of resources:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savory|first=Allan|title=Putting Holistic Management In Place|url=http://www.savoryinstitute.com/holistic-management/works/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111074423/http://www.savoryinstitute.com/holistic-management/works/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 January 2012|work=Savory Institute|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=Preston|title=Holistic Management: A Whole-Farm Decision Making Framework|url=https://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/summaries/summary.php?pub=296|work=The National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service - ATTRA|publisher=National Center for Appropriate Technology (NCAT)|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Define in its entirety what you are managing. No area should be treated as a single-product system. By defining the whole, people are better able to manage. This includes identifying the available resources, including [[money management|money]], that the manager has at his disposal.
#Define what you want now and for the future. Set the objectives, goals and actions needed to produce the [[quality of life]] sought, and what the [[Mother nature|life-nurturing environment]] must be like to sustain that quality of life far into the future.
#Watch for the earliest indicators of ecosystem health. Identify the ecosystem services that have deep impacts for people in both urban and rural environments, and find a way to easily monitor them. One of the best examples of an early indicator of a poorly functioning environment is patches of bare ground. An indicator of a better functioning environment is newly sprouting diversity of plants and a return or increase of wildlife.
#Don't limit the management tools you use. The eight tools for managing natural resources are money/labor, human creativity, grazing, animal impact, fire, rest, living organisms and [[Agricultural science|science]]/technology. To be successful you need to use all these tools to the best of your ability.
#Test your decisions with questions that are designed to help ensure all your decisions are socially, environmentally and financially sound for both the short and long term.
#Monitor [[Proactivity|proactively]], before your managed system becomes more imbalanced. This way the manager can take adaptive corrective action quickly, before the ecosystem services are lost. Always assume your plan is less than perfect and use a [[feedback loop]] that includes monitoring for the earliest signs of failure, adjusting and re-planning as needed. In other words, use a "[[wikt:canary in a coal mine|canary in a coal mine]]" adaptive approach.

== Four principles ==
Holistic management planned grazing has four key principles that take advantage of the [[symbiotic]] relationship between large herds of grazing animals, their [[predator]]s and the grasslands that support them:&lt;ref name="Sullivan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savory|first=Allan|title=Principles of Holistic Management, Empowering Caretakers of the Land|url=http://www.savoryinstitute.com/holistic-management/principles-of-holistic-management/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109072440/http://www.savoryinstitute.com/holistic-management/principles-of-holistic-management/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 January 2012|work=Savory Institute|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Nature functions as a [[holistic community]] with a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship between people, animals and the land. If you remove or change the behavior of any [[keystone species]] like the large grazing herds, you have an unexpected and wide-ranging negative impact on other areas of the environment.
#It is absolutely crucial that any agricultural planning system must be flexible enough to adapt to [[Complex systems|nature’s complexity]], since all environments are different and have constantly changing local conditions.
#[[Animal husbandry]] using [[Domestication|domestic species]] can be used as a substitute for lost keystone species. Thus when managed properly in a way that mimics nature, agriculture can heal the land and even benefit wildlife, while at the same time benefiting people.
#Time and timing is the most important factor when planning land use. Not only is it crucial to understand how long to use the land for agriculture and how long to rest, it is equally important to understand exactly when and where the land is ready for that use and rest.

== Criticism ==
Claims that holistic grazing can have a profound effect on climate change by making grazing cattle carbon negative have no basis in any peer-reviewed scientific literature and are based on literature only available on the Savory Institute website. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2014/aug/04/eat-more-meat-and-save-the-world-the-latest-implausible-farming-miracle|title=Eat more meat and save the world: the latest implausible farming miracle {{!}} George Monbiot|last=Monbiot|first=George|date=2014-08-04|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service. p.32: "These results refute prior claims that animal trampling associated with high stocking rates or grazing pressures in rotational grazing systems enhance soil properties and promote hydrological function."&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, a survey article by Briske et al.

A paper by Richard Teague, a coauthor of the USDA paper, et al. pointed out that Briske had examined rotational systems in general and not Savory's holistic planned grazing process, developed in the 1960s when Savory recognized that a hundred years of rotational and other prescribed grazing systems had exacerbated desertification, even in the U.S. as stated in Savory’s TED talk.  The paper contrasted the success reported by many ranchers practicing multi-paddock grazing with the general lack of evidence found by formal research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Teague |first=Richard |first2=Fred |last2=Provenza |first3=Brien |last3=Norton |first4=Tim |last4=Steffens |first5=Matthew |last5=Barnes |first6=Mort |last6=Kothmann |first7=Roy |last7=Roath |year=2008 |chapter=Benefits of Multi-Paddock Grazing Management on Rangelands: Limitations of Experimental Grazing Research and Knowledge Gaps | editor-first=H.G. |editor-last=Schroder |title=Grasslands: Ecology, Management and Restoration |publisher=Nova Science Publishers |place=New York |pages=41–80 |isbn=978-1-60692-023-7 |url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/files.posterous.com/circleranch/7LUk5o99J7YM4C5iC5X11lrOExFZJJicGpGRz2qk6NGkxX9ymeLRzXwr63aj/TeaguePaper.doc?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJFZAE65UYRT34AOQ&amp;Expires=1365062329&amp;Signature=FHjrGi7SJy1TJGH89tsYm1f%2F6DA%3D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Rangelands  |volume=9 |number=4 |date=August 1987 |title=Southern Africa's Experience with Intensive Short Duration Grazing |first=Jon |last=Skovlin |pages=162–167 |jstor=3900978}}&lt;/ref&gt; that compared short duration grazing (SDG) and Savory Grazing Method (SGM) in southern Africa and found no evidence of range improvement, a slight economic improvement of a seven-unit intensive system with more animals but with individual weight loss. That study found no evidence for soil improvement, but instead that increased trampling had led to soil compaction.

In March 2013, the Savory Institute published a research portfolio with selected abstracts of papers, theses and reports supporting holistic management and responding to some of their critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Savory Institute |title=Holistic Management Research Portfolio |date=March 2013 |accessdate=4 December 2015 |url=http://www.savoryinstitute.net/media/40606/Savory_Inst_HM_Research_Portfolio_March2013.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208152705/http://www.savoryinstitute.net/media/40606/Savory_Inst_HM_Research_Portfolio_March2013.pdf |archivedate=8 December 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month Savory was a guest speaker with TED and gave a presentation titled "How to Fight Desertification and Reverse Climate Change".

== Support ==
A few scientists have focused much of their research to demonstrate the science behind how Holistic Planned Grazing (or Adaptive Multi-Paddock Grazing) does improve soil health and there is a growing body of research work which is reversing the claim that the only evidence for holistic management is anecdotal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Itzkan|first1=Seth|title=Key Research Paper Summaries Germane to Holistic Management|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XlQeLBDHnhXt_5_-jY1NIerQfQhls6CzS3Qx5_Um1kQ/pub|publisher=Google Drive|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil scientist Dr. Christine Jones from Australia with much of her research available on her [http://www.amazingcarbon.com/ website], wrote an article in which she discussed the research done by Dr. Mark Adams from the University of Sydney regarding the soil's ability to sequester methane.

Dr. Richard Teague from Texas A&amp;M Agrilife has a number of different studies that he has undertaken focusing on [http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/7/10/13500 GHG mitigation],  as well as an [http://www.jswconline.org/content/71/2/156.full.pdf article] on the role of ruminants in reducing agriculture’s carbon that was co-authored with  Dr. Rattan Lal of Ohio State University. Teague has also done specific [https://ca.news.yahoo.com/alberta-ranchers-intensive-grazing-practices-004347231.html research in Canada] and [http://fergusonfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/StevenApfelbaum-DiggingDeeper.pdf Texas] comparing the increased carbon sequestration on land where people are practicing Holistic Planned Grazing in comparison to their neighbors that are not. On average in the Texas study the holistically grazed land added 3 tons Carbon/ha/yr more than the heavy continuously grazed neighboring land.

Dr. Keith Weber from Idaho State University who shows [https://issuu.com/defendingbeef/docs/weber__k.t._et_al._2013_effect_of_g how holistic planned grazing improves soil moisture retention on semi-arid rangelands]. This water retention leads to more plant growth which increases soil carbon and thus carbon sequestration.

Some qualitative studies show the improved profitability and sustainability of holistically managed operations and the efficacy of Holistic Management as a whole farm/ranch planning tool. In particular, Dr. Deborah Stinner, Dr. Benjamin Stinner of (Ohio State University at Wooster), and Ed Marsolf wrote an article [https://holisticmanagement.org/blog/biodiversity-as-an-organizing-principle/ about Holistic Management and how biodiversity is an organizing principle in agroecosystem management]. Another was done by Charley Orchard as he surveyed ranchers in the Northern Rockies and the [https://holisticmanagement.org/holistic-management/success-stories/northern-rockies-holistic-management-survey-results/ results they had achieved].

'''Interactive street theatre''' is a combination of [[street theatre]] and [[interactive art]].
There are different kinds of interactive street theatre. The biggest difference between “normal interactive art” and "interactive street theatre" is that the presentation. 
The presentation of is always outside in a public place and most of the time on a festival. The audience are people how just walk by and stop and participate. You can participate but if you don’t want you can just watch. It is temporary, only a few hours. And it is easier to participate than in a gallery or a museum. People who might not have ever to a theatre or museum can now participate in an interactive street theatre.

Some interactive art installations visitor can "walk" in, on, and around them. And to “play” with the object of the installations. Another form is that spectators themselves become part of the artwork. And a third option is that spectator become active and work to gather to great a collective art piece.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3771">'''Invisible Battalion''' is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] advocacy campaign, a [[Sociology|sociological]] research group, and a [[civil rights]] project for [[Gender equality|gender equality]] in the [[Armed Forces of Ukraine]].

== Activities ==
It was launched in 2015 as a sociological survey conducted by the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]] sociologists on women's participation in [[War in Donbass|the war]] in the [[Eastern Ukraine|East of Ukraine]]&lt;ref name="uwf.org.ua"&gt;https://www.uwf.org.ua/files/invisible_batallion_eng_short.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. The survey revealed a number of problems: [[Legislation of Ukraine|Ukrainian legislation]] didn’t allow women to be assigned to combat positions, so they were enlisted as cooks, seamstresses, cleaners, accountants etc. while taking part in military combat operations as snipers, grenade launcher operators, reconnaissance soldiers, artillerists etc. This was done on semi-legal grounds. Thus, the majority of women who served in the war in Donbass were not enlisted officially and subsequently had no access to social or military benefits, military awards, social status, or career opportunities in the Armed Forces&lt;ref name="uwf.org.ua"/&gt;. 
With the support of Ukrainian Women's Fund and [[UN Women]], the ''Invisible Battalion'' survey turned into an ambitious photo project: about half a hundred portraits of Ukrainian women combatants were shot and exhibited at the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian Parliament]] and the [[Ministry of Defence (Ukraine)|Ministry of Defense of Ukraine]].
In 2016 the Invisible Battalion year calendar won the Grand Prix at the National Festival of Social Advertising&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uwf.org.ua/en/news/1142|title=Calendar "Invisible Battalion" won at the National Festival of Social Advertising|website=www.uwf.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Later on, the Invisible Battalion social project turned into a full-length [[documentary]] Invisible Battalion: six stories of six women who were (or are) combatants at war in the East of Ukraine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uacrisis.org/57284-nevidimij-bataljon|title=Invisible battalion: film about war in Donbas through Ukrainian women's eyes - UACRISIS.ORG|date=9 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Three women directors–[[Iryna Tsilyk]], Alina Gorlova, and Svitlana Lischynska–offer female perspectives on war that are bluntly honest. This documentary is a female account of war in the East of Ukraine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YBS1Hf6TvM|title=Trailer Invisible Battalion|first=|last=Марія Берлінська|date=7 November 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Accomplishments ==
Both as a result of the campaign, and the pressure of society and different international organizations the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine expanded the number of military jobs (63 in total) available to women (Directive #292 “On expanding military jobs for soldier, sergeant, and officer staff)&lt;ref&gt;http://zakon3.rada.gov.ua/laws/file/text/55/f428526n45.zip&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eca.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2016/10/women-are-changing-the-face-of-armed-forces-in-ukraine|title=Women are changing the face of armed forces in Ukraine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, even now {{frac|2|3}} of soldier and officer jobs are still unavailable to women. Moreover, women don’t have equal access to military education and careers.

Invisible Battalion is still fighting for the legal status of women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the civil rights of women veterans and other aspects of female involvement in the military.

[[File:Frauenberg 030.jpg|thumb|[[Fresco]] of the Judgment of Solomon, {{Interlanguage link multi|Wallfahrtskirche Frauenberg|de}} [[Frauenberg, Styria]]]]

The '''Judgment of Solomon''' is a story from the [[Hebrew Bible]] in which [[Solomon|King Solomon of Israel]] ruled between two women both claiming to be the mother of a child. Solomon revealed their true feelings and relationship to the child by suggesting to cut the baby in two, with each woman to receive half. With this strategy,  he was able to discern the non-mother as the woman who entirely approved of this proposal, while the actual mother begged that the sword might be sheathed and the child committed to the care of her rival. Some consider this approach to justice an [[archetype|archetypal]] example of an impartial judge displaying wisdom in making a ruling.

==Biblical narrative==
[[File:Giorgione Salomone.jpg|thumb|''[[The Judgement of Solomon (Giorgione)|The Judgement of Solomon]]'' (School of [[Giorgione]], 1500)]]

{{bibleverse|1|Kings|3:16–28|HE}} recounts that two mothers living in the same house, each the mother of an infant son, came to Solomon. One of the babies [[Overlaying|had been smothered]], and each claimed the remaining boy as her own. Calling for a sword, Solomon declared his judgment: the baby would be cut in two, each woman to receive half. One mother did not contest the ruling, declaring that if she could not have the baby then neither of them could, but the other begged Solomon, "Give the baby to her, just don't kill him!"

The king declared the second woman the true mother, as a mother would even give up her baby if that was necessary to save its life. This judgment became known throughout all of Israel and was considered an example of profound wisdom.

==Classification and parallels==
The story is commonly viewed in scholarship as an instance or a reworking of a [[Folklore|folktale]]. Its folkloristic nature is apparent, among other things, in the dominance of [[direct speech]] which moves the plot on and contributes to the [[characterization]].&lt;ref name="Mordechai Cogan 2001, p. 196"&gt;Mordechai Cogan, ''I Kings'' (Anchor Bible), New York: Doubleday, 2001, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; The story is classified as [[Aarne-Thompson]] tale type 926, and many parallel stories have been found in world [[folklore]]. In Uther's edition of the Aarne-Thompson index,&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Jörg Uther, ''The Types of International Folktales: A Classification and Bibliography, Based on the System of Antii Aarne and Stith Thompson'', I, Helsinki: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; this tale type is classified as a [[Novella (folklore)|folk novella]], and belongs to a subgroup designated: "Clever Acts and Words". Eli Yassif defines the folk novella as "a realistic story whose time and place are determined&amp;nbsp;... The novella emphasizes such human traits as cleverness, eroticism, loyalty, and wiliness, that drive the plot forward more than any other element".&lt;ref&gt;Eli Yassif, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LbZPv-2LO6YC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Hebrew Folktale: History, Genre, Meaning''] (Folklore Studies in Translation), Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1999, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hugo Gressmann]] has found 22 similar stories in world folklore and literature, especially in India and the far east.&lt;ref&gt;See Hugo Gressmann, [https://archive.org/stream/deutscherundsch130stutuoft#page/212/mode/2up "Das salomonische Urteil"], ''Deutsche Rundschau'' 130 (1907), pp. 212–28&lt;/ref&gt; One Indian version is a [[Jataka]] story dealing with [[Buddha]] in one of his previous incarnations as the sage Mahosadha, who arbitrates between a mother and a [[Yakshini]] who is in the shape of a woman, who kidnapped the mother's baby and claimed he was hers. The sage announced a [[tug war]]: He drew a line on the ground and asked the two to stand on opposite sides of the line, one holding his feet and the other his hands – The one who would pull the baby's whole body beyond the line would get him. The mother, seeing how the baby suffers, released him and let the Yakshini take him, weeping. When the sage saw that, he turned the baby back to the hands of the true mother, exposed the identity of the Yakshini and expelled her.&lt;ref&gt;See E. B. Cowell (ed.), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/j6/j6012.htm#page_163 ''The Jātaka, or Stories of the Buddha's Former Births''], VI, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1907, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; In other Indian versions the two women are widows of one husband.&lt;ref&gt;See for example G. R. Subramiah Pantulu, ''Indian Antiquary'' 26 (1897), [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.61241/2015.61241.The-Indian-Antiquary-Vol-Xxvi#page/n111/mode/2up p. 111]&lt;/ref&gt; Another version appears in the Chinese drama [[The Chalk Circle]] (in this version the judge draws a circle on the ground),&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Herzl Gaster, ''Myth, Legend, and Custom in the Old Testament: A Comparative Study with Chapters from Sir James G. Frazer's Folklore in the Old Testament'', II, New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1969, p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt; which has been widespread all over the world and many versions and reworkings were made after it, among them [[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]], a play by [[Bertolt Brecht]].
[[File:Gaspar de Crayer - The judgement of Solomon.jpg|thumb|left|290px|''The judgement of Solomon'' by [[Gaspar de Crayer]], c. 1620]]
The common motif in those different parallels is that the wise judge announces an absurd procedure, which is reasonable in some perverse way: Splitting the baby, according to the principle of compromise; Or a tug war, in which one can possibly assume that the true mother will be motivated to pull harder. But this procedure is actually a concealed emotional test, designed to force each woman to decide whether her compassion to the baby overpowers her will to win.&lt;ref name="William Hansen 2002, p. 228"&gt;William Hansen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ezDlXl7gP9oC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA228#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature''], Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2002, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is indirect evidence that the story was widespread in ancient times in the western world too. A Greek [[papyrus]] fragment, dating from the beginning of the second century AD, includes a fragmented reference to an ancient legal case which is similar to the judgment of Solomon. The writer ascribes the story to Phliliskos of [[Miletos]], living in the fourth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;William Hansen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ezDlXl7gP9oC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA229#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature''], Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2002, pp. 229–30.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[fresco]] found in the "House of the Physician" in [[Pompeii]] depicts [[pygmies]] introducing a scene similar to the biblical story.&lt;ref name="Hansen: fresco"&gt;William Hansen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ezDlXl7gP9oC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA231#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature''], Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2002, pp. 231–32. [http://www.flickriver.com/photos/16472880@N06/2218609158/ A picture of the fresco].&lt;/ref&gt; Some think that the fresco relates directly to the biblical story,&lt;ref&gt;Frederick E. Brenk, "Greek, Greeks; C. Religion", ''Encyclopedia of the Bible and its Reception'', v. 10, 2015, p. 889.&lt;/ref&gt; while according to others it represents a parallel tradition.&lt;ref name="Hansen: fresco" /&gt;

Several suggestions for the genre of the biblical story have been raised, beyond its characterization as a folktale of a known type. [[Edward Lipinski (orientalist)|Edward Lipinski]] suggests that the story is an example of "king's bench tales", a subgenre of the [[wisdom literature]] to which he finds parallels in [[Sumerian literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lipinski, "Ancient Types of Wisdom Literature in Biblical Narrative", in Alexander Rofé and Yair Zakovitch (eds.), ''Isac Leo Seeligmann Volume'', Jerusalem: E. Rubenstein, 1983, pp. 51–55&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have pointed out that the story resembles the modern [[Detective fiction|detective story]] genre. Both king Solomon and the reader are confronted with some kind of a juridical-detective riddle. [[Meir Sternberg]] notes that two genres merge in the story: A riddle and a test; The juridical dilemma, which is the riddle, also constitutes a test for the young king: If he will solve it he will be acknowledged to possess divine wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Meir Sternberg, ''The Poetics of Biblical Narrative: Ideological Literature and the Drama of Reading'' (Indiana Studies in Biblical Literature), Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1985, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart Lasine classifies the story as a law-court riddle.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Lasine, "The Riddle of Solomon’s Judgment and the Riddle of Human Nature in the Hebrew Bible", ''Journal for the Study of the Old Testament'' 45 (1989), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Raymond Westbrook]], the story is essentially a hypothetical problem, introduced to the recipient as a pure intellectual challenge and not as a concrete juridical case. In such problems, any unnecessary detail is usually omitted, and this is the reason why the characters in the story have no distinctive characteristics. Also, the description of the case eliminates the possibility to obtain circumstantial evidence, thereby forcing the recipient to confront the dilemma directly and not seek for indirect ways to solve it.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Westbrook, "Law in Kings", in [[André Lemaire]], Baruch Halpern, and Matthew J. Adams (eds.), ''The Book of Kings: Sources, Composition, Historiography and Reception'' (Supplements to Vetus Testamentum 129), Leiden: Brill, 2010, pp. 446–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars think that the original folk story underwent significant literary reworking so that in its biblical crystallization it can no longer be defined as a folktale. Jacob Liver notes the absence of any "local coloring" in the story, and concludes that the story is "not an actual folk tale but a scholarly reworking of a folk tale (apparently from a non-Israelite source) which in some way reached the court circles of Jerusalem in the times of Solomon".&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Liver, "The Book of the Acts of Solomon", ''Biblica'' 48 (1967), p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Jeev Weisman characterizes it as "a [[Wisdom literature|wisdom]] [[anecdote]] which originated in the court circles".&lt;ref&gt;Translation from the Hebrew original: "אנקדוטה חכמתית שמוצאה מחוגי החצר" (Jeev Weisman, ''Political Satire in the Bible'' [The Biblical Encyclopaedia Library 13], Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1996, p. 213). George W. Coats also characterizes it as an anecdote ("Parable, Fable, and Anecdote: Storytelling in the Succession Narrative", ''Interpretation'' 35 [1981], p. 379)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The story has a number of parallels in folktales from various cultures. All of the known parallels, among them several from [[India]], have been recorded in later periods than the biblical story; nevertheless, it is unclear as to whether they reflect earlier or later traditions. [[Hermann Gunkel]] rules out the possibility that such a sophisticated motif had developed independently in different places.&lt;ref name="Hermann Gunkel 1987, p. 156"&gt;Hermann Gunkel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CC_bBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Folktale in the Old Testament''] (Historic Texts and Interpreters in Biblical Scholarship), translated by Michael D. Rutter, Sheffield, UK: Almond, 1987, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars are of the opinion that the source of the story is untraceable.&lt;ref name="MontgomeryGehman"&gt;James A. Montgomery and Henry Snyder Gehman, [https://archive.org/stream/criticalexegetic10montuoft#page/108/mode/2up ''Kings''] (International Critical Commentary), Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1951, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gwilym H. Jones, ''1 and 2 Kings'' (New Century Bible), I, Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1984, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the biblical version, the two women are identified as prostitutes, as opposed to some Indian versions in which they are widows of one husband. Some scholars have inferred from this difference as to the origin of the story. Following Gressmann,&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Gressmann, [https://archive.org/stream/deutscherundsch130stutuoft#page/218/mode/2up "Das salomonische Urteil"], ''Deutsche Rundschau'' 130 (1907), pp. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Gunkel speculates a possible Indian origin, on the basis that "[s]uch stories of wise judgments are the real life stuff of the Indian people", and that, in his view, "a prostitute has no reason to value a child which was not born to her"; he acknowledges, however, that the Indian versions "belong to a later period".&lt;ref name="Hermann Gunkel 1987, p. 156"/&gt; On the other hand, Lasine opines that the Hebrew story is better motivated than the Indian one, for it is the only one in which the motivation for the behavior of both women is rooted in typical motherly feelings: compassion for the true mother, and jealousy for the impostor.&lt;ref name="Lasine"&gt;Stuart Lasine, "The Riddle of Solomon’s Judgment and the Riddle of Human Nature in the Hebrew Bible", ''Journal for the Study of the Old Testament'' 45 (1989), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars point out that such a travelling folktale might become, in its various forms, more or less coherent; the assertion that one version is more coherent than the other does not compel the conclusion that the first is more original.&lt;ref name="William Hansen 2002, p. 228"/&gt; Consequently, the argument as to which version's women had more compelling reasons to fight over the child would be irrelevant.

==Composition and editorial framing==
The story is considered to be literarily unified, without significant editorial intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Mulder, ''1 Kings'' (Historical Commentary on the Old Testament), translated by John Vriend, Leuven: Peeters, 1998, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burke O. Long 1984, p. 68"&gt;Burke O. Long, [https://books.google.co.il/books?id=o3Vxhco6ItcC&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''1 Kings''] (Forms of the Old Testament Literature 9), Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1984, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The ending of the story, noting the wisdom of Solomon, is considered to be a [[Deuteronomist]]ic addition to the text.&lt;ref name="Mordechai Cogan 2001, p. 196"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Volkmar Fritz, ''1 &amp; 2 Kings'' (Continental Commentary), translated by Anselm Hagedorn, Minneapolis: Fortress, 2003, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars consider the story an originally independent unit, integrated into its present context by an editor.&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Cogan, ''I Kings'' (Anchor Bible), New York: Doubleday, 2001, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon J. DeVries, ''1 Kings'' (Word Biblical Commentary 12), Waco, TX: Word Books, 1985, pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Solomon's name is not mentioned in the story, and he is simply called "the king". Considered out of context, the story leaves the king anonymous just like the other characters. Some scholars think that the original tale was not necessarily about Solomon, and perhaps dealt with a typical unnamed king. A different opinion is held by Eli Yassif, who thinks that the author of the Book of Kings did not attribute the story to Solomon on his own behalf, but the attribution to Solomon had already developed in preliterary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Yassif, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LbZPv-2LO6YC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Hebrew Folktale: History, Genre, Meaning''] (Folklore Studies in Translation), Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1999, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars point out that the story is linked to the preceding account of Solomon's dream in Gibeon, by the common pattern of prophetic dream and its subsequent fulfillment. Some think this proximity of the stories results from the work of a [[Redaction|redactor]]. Others, such as Saul Zalewski, consider the two accounts to be inseparable and to form a literarily unified unit.&lt;ref&gt;Saul Zalewski, ''Solomon's Ascension to the Throne: Studies in the Books of Kings and Chronicles'', Jerusalem: Y. Marcus, 1981, pp. 188–92 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

In its broader context, the Judgment of Solomon forms part of the account of Solomon's reign, generally conceived as a distinct segment in the Book of Kings, compassing chapters 3–11 in 1 Kings; Some include in it also chapters 1–2, while others think that these chapters originally ended the account of David's reign in 2 Samuel. According to Liver, the source for the Judgment of Solomon story, as well as other parts of the account of Solomon's reign, is in the speculated book of the [[Acts of Solomon]], which he proposes to be a wisdom work which originated in the court circles shortly after the split of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|united monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Liver, "The Book of the Acts of Solomon", ''Biblica'' 48 (1967), pp. 75–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==

===General description===
The story may be divided to two parts similar in length, matching the trial's sequence. In the first part (verses 16–22) the case is described: The two women introduce their arguments, and at this point, no response from the king is recorded. In the second part (23–28) the decision is described: the king is the major speaker and the one who directs the plot. Apart from this clear twofold division, suggestions have been raised as to the plot structure and the literary structure of the story and its internal relations.&lt;ref&gt;For the plot structure see the commentaries, and also Bezalel Porten, "The Structure and Theme of the Solomon Narrative (I Kings 3-11)", ''Hebrew Union College Annual'' 38 (1967), pp. 99–100. For the literary structure see Willem A. M. Beuken, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BDlCAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "No Wise King without a Wise Woman (I Kings III 16–28)"], in A. S. van der Woude (ed.), ''New Avenues in the Study of the Old Testament: A Collection of Old Testament Studies, Published on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Oudtestamentisch Werkgezelschap and the Retirement of Prof. Dr. M. J. Mulder'' (Oudtestamentische Studiën 25), Leiden: Brill, 1989, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

As stated before, most of the story is reported by [[direct speech]] of the women and Solomon, with a few sentences and utterance verbs by the narrator. The dialogues move the plot forward.&lt;ref name="Burke O. Long 1984, p. 68"/&gt; The women's contradictory testimonies create the initial conflict necessary to build up the [[dramatic tension]]. The king's request to bring him a sword enhances the tension, as the reader wonders why it is needed. The story comes to its climax with the shocking royal order to cut the boy, which for a moment casts doubt on the king's judgment. But what seems to be the verdict turns out to be a clever trick which achieves its goal, and results in the recognition of the true mother and the resolution.

===Purpose===
The major overt purpose of the account of Solomon's reign, to which the Judgment of Solomon belongs as stated above, is to glorify King Solomon, and his wisdom is one of the account's dominant themes. The exceptions are: The first two chapters (1 Kings 1–2), which according to many scholars portray a dubious image of Solomon, and as stated above, are sometimes ascribed to a separate work; And the last chapter in the account (11), which describes Solomon's sins in his old age. Nevertheless, many scholars point out to elements in the account that criticize Solomon, anticipating his downfall in chapter 11.&lt;ref&gt;See in detail: Daniel J. Hays, "Has the Narrator Come to Praise Solomon or to Bury Him? Narrative Subtlety in 1 Kings 1–11", ''Journal for the Study of the Old Testament'' 28/2 (2003), pp. 149–74; And the literature cited at pp. 151–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its immediate context, the story follows the account of Solomon's dream at [[Gibeon (ancient city)|Gibeon]], in which he was promised by God to be given unprecedented wisdom. Most scholars read the story at face value, and conclude that its major purpose is to demonstrate the fulfillment of the divine promise and to illustrate Solomon's wisdom expressed in a juridical form. Yet some scholars recognize in this story too, as in other parts of the account of Solomon's reign, ironic elements which are not consistent with the story's overt purpose to glorify Solomon.

Some scholars assume, as mentioned, that the story had existed independently before it was integrated into its current context. Willem Beuken think that the original tale was not about the king's wisdom – the concluding note about Solomon's wisdom is considered secondary – but about a woman who, by listening to her motherly instinct, helped the king to break through the legal impasse. Beuken notes additional biblical stories which share the motif of the woman who influenced the king: [[Bathsheba]], the [[woman of Tekoa]], and Solomon's foreign wives who seduced him into idolatry.&lt;ref&gt;Willem A. M. Beuken, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BDlCAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "No Wise King without a Wise Woman (I Kings III 16–28)"], in A. S. van der Woude (ed.), ''New Avenues in the Study of the Old Testament: A Collection of Old Testament Studies, Published on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Oudtestamentisch Werkgezelschap and the Retirement of Prof. Dr. M. J. Mulder'' (Oudtestamentische Studiën 25), Leiden: Brill, 1989, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Beuken concludes that the true mother exemplifies the biblical character type of the wise woman.&lt;ref&gt;Willem A. M. Beuken, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BDlCAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "No Wise King without a Wise Woman (I Kings III 16–28)"], in A.

J. Mulder'' (Oudtestamentische Studiën 25), Leiden: Brill, 1989, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposes an analysis of the literary structure of the story, according to which the section that notes the compassion of the true mother (verse 26b) constitutes one of the two climaxes of the story, along with the section that announces Solomon's divine wisdom (verse 28b). According to this analysis, the story in its current context gives equal weight to the compassion of the true mother and to the godly wisdom that guided Solomon in the trial.&lt;ref&gt;Willem A. M. Beuken, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BDlCAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "No Wise King without a Wise Woman (I Kings III 16–28)"], in A.

J. Mulder'' (Oudtestamentische Studiën 25), Leiden: Brill, 1989, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Marvin A. Sweeney|Marvin Sweeney]], in its original context, as part of the [[Deuteronomistic history]], the story exalted Solomon as a wise ruler and presented him as a model to [[Hezekiah]]. Later, the narrative context of the story has undergone another Deuteronomistic redaction that has undermined Solomon's figure in comparison to [[Josiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Marvin A. Sweeney, [https://books.google.co.il/books?id=d4jn8uj49RIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''I &amp; II Kings''] (Old Testament Library), Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox, 2007, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In its current context, the story implicitly criticizes Solomon for violating the biblical law that sets the [[Priesthood (Ancient Israel)|priests]] and [[Levite]]s on top of the judicial hierarchy (Deuteronomy 17:8–13).&lt;ref&gt;Marvin A. Sweeney, ''I &amp; II Kings'' (Old Testament Library), Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox, 2007, pp. [https://books.google.co.il/books?id=d4jn8uj49RIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 73], [https://books.google.co.il/books?id=d4jn8uj49RIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 82].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intra-biblical allusions===
Several stories in the Hebrew Bible bear similarity to the Judgment of Solomon, and scholars think they allude to it.

The most similar story is that of the two cannibal mothers in 2 Kings 6:24–33, which forms part of the [[Elisha]] cycle. The background is a famine in [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]], caused by a siege on the city. As the king passes through the city, a woman calls him and asks him to decide in a quarrel between her and another woman: The two women had agreed to cook and eat the son of one woman, and on the other day to do the same with the son of the other woman; but after they ate the first woman's son, the other woman hid her own son. The king, shocked from the description of the case, tore up his royal cloth and revealed that he was wearing sackcloth beneath it. He blamed Elisha for the circumstances and went on to chase him.

There are some striking similarities between this story and the Judgment of Solomon. Both deal with nameless women who gave birth to a son. One of the son dies, and a quarrel erupts as to the fate of the other one. The case is brought before the king to decide. According to Lasine, the comparison between the stories emphasize the absurdity of the situation in the story of the cannibal mothers: While in the Judgment of Solomon, the king depend on his knowledge of maternal nature to decide the case, the story of the cannibal women describe a "topsy-turvy" world in which maternal nature does not work as expected, thus leaving the king helpless.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Lasine, "Jehoram and the Cannibal Mothers (2 Kings 6.24–33): Solomon’s Judgment in an Inverted World", ''Journal for the Study of the Old Testament'' 50 (1991), pp. 27–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The women's characters===
Like many other women in the Hebrew Bible, the two women in this story are anonymous. Perhaps their names have not been mentioned so that they would not overshadow Solomon's wisdom, which is the main theme of the story. The women seem to be poor. They live alone in a shared residence, without servants. As prostitutes, they lack male patronage and have to take care of themselves in a patriarchal society.&lt;ref&gt;Athalya Brenner, ''The Israelite Woman: Social Role and Literary Type in Biblical Narrative'' (The Biblical Seminar 2), Sheffield, UK: JSOT Press, 1985, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The women's designation as prostitutes is necessary as background to the plot: It clarifies why the women live alone, gave birth alone and were alone during the alleged switch of the babies;&lt;ref name="Simon J. DeVries 1985, p. 61"&gt;Simon J. DeVries, ''1 Kings'' (Word Biblical Commentary), Waco, TX: Word Books, 1985, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of witnesses seems to create a legal impasse that only the wise king can solve. It also clarifies why the women are not represented by their husbands, as is customary in biblical society.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Ann Bird, "The Harlot as Heroine: Narrative Art and Social Presupposition in Three Old Testament Texts", ''Semeia'' 46 (1989), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Solomon is depicted as a king accessible to all of his subjects, even those in the margins of society.&lt;ref name="Simon J. DeVries 1985, p. 61"/&gt; The women's designation as prostitutes links the story to the common biblical theme of God as the protector of the weak, "A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows" (Psalms 68:5). Prostitutes in biblical society are considered functional widows, for they have no male patron to represent them in court, and their sons are considered fatherless. They also bear similarity to the [[proselyte]], who is sometimes mentioned in the Hebrew Bible with the widow and the fatherless, in that they are socially marginalized and deprived of the right to advocacy. They can only seek justice from one place: God, embodied in the story as the source of Solomon's wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Carole R. Fontaine, "The Bearing of Wisdom on the Shape of 2 Samuel 11-12 and 1 Kings 3", ''Journal for the Study of the Old Testament'' 34 (1986), pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gina Hens-Piazza, ''Of Methods, Monarchs, and Meanings: A Sociorhetorical Approach to Exegesis'' (Studies in Old Testament Interpretation 3), Macon, GA: Mercer University Press, 1996, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

The women are not explicitly condemned for their occupation,&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Cogan, ''I Kings'' (Anchor Bible), New York: Doubleday, 2001, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; and some think that the narrator does not intend to discredit them for being prostitutes, and their conduct should be judged against universal human standards.&lt;ref&gt;Volkmar Fritz, ''1 &amp; 2 Kings'' (Continental Commentary), translated by Anselm Hagedorn, Minneapolis: Fortress, 2003, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Phyllis Bird]] thinks that the story presupposes the stereotypical biblical image of the prostitute as a selfish liar. The true mother is revealed when her motherly essence – which is also stereotypical – surpasses her selfish essence.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Ann Bird, "The Harlot as Heroine: Narrative Art and Social Presupposition in Three Old Testament Texts", ''Semeia'' 46 (1989), pp. 132–33&lt;/ref&gt; [[Athalya Brenner]] notes that both women's maternal instinct is intact: For the true mother it is manifested, as mentioned, in the compassion and devotion that she shows for her son; And for the impostor it is manifested in her desire for a son, which makes her steal the other mother's son when her own son dies. According to Brenner, one of the lessons of the story is that "true maternal feelings&amp;nbsp;... may exist even in the bosom of the lowliest woman".&lt;ref&gt;Athalya Brenner, ''The Israelite Woman: Social Role and Literary Type in Biblical Narrative'' (The Biblical Seminar 2), Sheffield, UK: JSOT Press, 1985, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The women are designated in the Hebrew text as ''zōnōṯ'' (זוֹנוֹת), which is the plural form of the adjective ''zōnâ'' (זוֹנָה), prostitute. However, some propose a different meaning for this word in the context of the story, such as "tavern owner" or "innkeeper". These proposals are usually dismissed as apologetic.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Mordechai Cogan, ''I Kings'' (Anchor Bible), New York: Doubleday, 2001, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Jerome T. Walsh combines the two meanings, and suggests that in ancient Near East, some prostitutes also provided lodging services (cf. the story of [[Rahab]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jerome T. Walsh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=B7vv5v76kVUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''1 Kings''] (Berit Olam), Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1996, p. 80 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison to detective literature===
As mentioned before, many scholars have compared the story to the modern genre of [[Detective fiction|detective story]]. A striking feature in the biblical story, untypical to its parallels,&lt;ref&gt;William Hansen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ezDlXl7gP9oC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA229#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature''], Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2002, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; is that it does not begin with a credible report of the [[omniscient narrator]] about the events that took place before the trial; It immediately opens with the women's testimonies. Thus, the reader is unable to determine whether the account given by the plaintiff is true or false, and he confronts, along with Solomon, a juridical-detective riddle. According to Sternberg, the basic convention shared by the Judgment of Solomon and the detective story genre is the "fair-play rule", which states that both the reader and the detective figure are exposed to the same relevant data.&lt;ref&gt;Meir Sternberg, ''The Poetics of Biblical Narrative: Ideological Literature and the Drama of Reading'' (Indiana Studies in Biblical Literature), Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1985, pp. 167–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lasine, dealing with the story from a sociological perspective, points out that like the detective story, the Judgment of Solomon story deals with human "epistemological anxiety" deriving from the fact that man, as opposed to God, is generally unable to know what is in the mind of other men. The detective story, as well as this biblical story, provides a comfort to this anxiety with the figure of the detective, or Solomon in this case: A master of human nature, a man who can see into the depths of one's soul and extract the truth from within it. This capability is conceived as a superhuman quality, inasmuch as Solomon's wisdom in judgment is described as a gift from God. There is an ambiguity concerning the question whether such a capability may serve as a model for others, or it is unavailable to ordinary men.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Lasine, [http://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/58746/HAR_v11_247.pdf?sequence=1 "Solomon, Daniel, and the Detective Story: The Social Function of a Literary Genre"], ''Hebrew Annual Review'' 11 (1987), pp. 247–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the story, Solomon reveals the identity of the true mother. But according to the Hebrew text, while the king solves the riddle, the reader is not exposed to the solution; Literally translated from the Hebrew text, Solomon command reads: "Give her the living child...". One cannot infer from this wording whether the word "her" refers to the plaintiff or to the defendant, as the narrator remains silent on the matter.

==Jewish interpretation==

According to the [[Midrash]], the two women were mother- and daughter-in-law, both of whom had borne sons and whose husbands had died. The lying daughter-in-law was obligated by the laws of [[Yibbum]] to marry her brother-in-law unless released from the arrangement through a formal ceremony. As her brother-in-law was the living child, she was required to marry him when he came of age or wait the same amount of time to be released and remarry. When Solomon suggested splitting the infant in half, the lying woman, wishing to escape the constraints of Yibbum in the eyes of God, agreed. Thus was Solomon able to know who the real mother was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jlaw.com/Commentary/solomon.html|title=Jewish Law – Commentary/Opinion – The Brilliant Wisdom of King Solomon|work=jlaw.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representations in art==
If the above-mentioned [[Pompei|Pompean]] fresco indeed depicts the Judgment of Solomon, it is the first known painting of a biblical story (presently moved to the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|''Museo Nazionale'' in Naples]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/ancient-cultures/solomon-socrates-and-aristotle/|title=Solomon, Socrates and Aristotle|work=Biblical Archaeology Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theme has long been a popular subject for artists and is often chosen for the decoration of courthouses. In the Netherlands, many 17th century courthouses (''Vierschaar'' rooms) contain a painting or relief of this scene. Elsewhere in Europe, celebrated examples include:
* Fresco by [[Raphael]]
* The Judgement of Solomon by [[William Blake]]
* Etching by [[Gustave Doré]]
* Woodcut by the school of [[Michael Wolgemut]] in the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]]
* Paintings by [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Poussin]] and [[Franz Caucig]]
* Relief sculpture on the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] in Venice by an unknown artist (near the exit into St. Mark's Square)
* Stained glass window by Jean Chastellain in [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais]] church of Paris

===Other media===
The scene has been the subject of television episodes of ''[[Dinosaurs (TV series)|Dinosaurs]]'', ''[[Recess (TV series)|Recess]]'', ''[[The Simpsons (TV series)|The Simpsons]]'' (where a pie was substituted for the baby), the [[Netflix]] animated series,  [[All Hail King Julien]], where a pineapple is cut in two to settle a dispute, the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode [[The Seven]], and ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]''. It has influenced other artistic disciplines, e.g. [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s play [[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]] and Ronnie snatching Kat's baby in ''[[EastEnders]]''.

The [[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]] song "Shatter Me With Hope" includes the line "We'll tear this baby apart, wise like Solomon".

=="Splitting the baby"==
The expressions "splitting the baby" or "cutting the baby in half" can be used to describe a split award (usually accompanied by a split costs award) in the most for a heavy-handed, costs-insensitive suit (such as entailing multiple hearings and disproportionate spending on both sides) for a relatively simple compromise.  The analogy reminds litigants to keep their costs down in cases where [[judge]] may well divide fault, i.e. may "split the difference" in terms of [[Damages|damage awards]] or other [[Legal remedy|remedies]] between the two [[Party (law)|parties]] (a very common example is in a [[comparative negligence]] case also known as contributory negligence scenario).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eba-net.org/adrblog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/splitting-the-baby-article-by-naimark.pdf Stephanie E.

[[File:Keyline irrigation channel at Orana.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A keyline irrigation channel in [[Orana (New South Wales)|Orana]], [[Australia]]]]
'''Keyline design''' is a landscaping technique of maximizing the beneficial use of the water resources of a tract of land. The "keyline" denominates a specific [[topography|topographic]] feature related to the natural flow of water on the tract. Keyline design is a system of principles and techniques of developing rural and urban landscapes to optimize use of their water resources.

Australian farmer and engineer [[P. A. Yeomans]] invented and developed Keyline design in his books ''The Keyline Plan'', ''The Challenge of Landscape'', ''Water For Every Farm'', and ''The City Forest''.

==Application==
[[P. A. Yeomans]] published the first book on Keyline design in 1954. Yeomans described a system of amplified contour ripping to control rainfall runoff and enable fast flood irrigation of undulating land without the need for [[Terrace (agriculture)|terracing]] it.

Keyline designs include irrigation dams equipped with through-the-wall lockpipe systems, [[gravity feed]] irrigation, stock water, and yard water. Graded earthen channels may be interlinked to broaden the catchment areas of high dams, conserve the height of water, and transfer rainfall runoff into the most efficient high dam sites. Roads follow both ridge lines and water channels to provide easier movement across the land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keyline.com.au Keyline Designs website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Keyline Scale of Permanence==
The foundation of Yeomans' Keyline design system is the Keyline Scale of Permanence (KSOP), which was the outcome of 15 years of adaptive experimentation. The Scale identifies the environmental elements of typical farms and orders them according to their degree of permanence as follows:
* Climate
* Landshape ([[topography]])
* Water supply
* Roads and means of access
* Trees
* Structures (edifices)
* Subdivisional fences
* Soil

Keyline design considers these elements in planning the placement of water storage features, roads, trees, edifices, and fences. On undulating land, keyline design involves identifying [[ridge]]s, [[valley]]s, and natural water courses and designing with them in mind in order to optimize water storage sites. Constructing interconnecting channels may be part of such optimization.

The identified natural water lines delineate the possible locations for the various less permanent elements, e. g.  roads, fences, trees, and edifices, which if so located would help optimize the natural potential of the land in question.

==Keypoint==

In a smooth, grassy valley, a location denominated the '''keypoint''' is identified at which the lower and leveller portion of the primary valley floor suddenly steepens higher. The '''keyline''' of this primary valley is determined by pegging a contour line that conforms to the natural shape of the valley through the keypoint, such that all points on the keyline are at the same elevation as the keypoint. Contour plowing both above and below the keyline and parallel to it ipso facto is "off-contour", but the developing pattern tends to drift rainwater runoff away from the center of the valley and, incidentally, prevent [[erosion]] of its soil.

Cultivation conforming to Keyline design for [[ridge]]s is done parallel to any suitable contour, but only on the high side of the contour's guide line. This ipso facto develops a pattern of off-contour cultivation in which all the rip marks made in the soil slope down towards the center of the ridge. This pattern of cultivation allows more time for water to infiltrate. Cultivation following Keyline pattern also enables controlled flood irrigation of undulating land, which increases the rate of development of deep, [[fertility|fertile]] soil.

In many nations, including [[Australia]], it is important to optimize infiltration of rainfall, and Keyline cultivation accomplishes this while delaying the concentration of runoff that could damage the land. Yeomans' technique differs from traditional contour plowing in several important respects. Random [[contour plowing]] also becomes off contour but usually with the opposite effect on runoff, namely causing it to quickly run off [[ridge]]s and concentrate in [[valley]]s. The limitations of the traditional system of '''soil conservation''', with its "safe disposal" approach to [[farm water]], was an important motivation to develop Keyline design.

==Applications==

[[David Holmgren]], one of the founders of [[permaculture]], used Yeoman's Keyline design extensively in the formulation of his principles of permaculture and the design of sustainable human settlements and [[organic farming|organic farms]].

Darren J. Doherty has extensive global experience in Keyline design, development, management, and education. He uses Keyline as the basis for his Regrarians framework, which he considers a revision and synthesis of Keyline design, [[permaculture]], holistic management, and several other innovative, human ecological frameworks into a coherent process-based system of design and management of regenerative economies.

A [[topographical]] example of Keyline design is available at ({{Coord|-37.159154|144.252248|region:AU_type:landmark|display=inline}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikimapia.org/beta/#lat=-37.1583499&amp;lon=144.2529345&amp;z=16&amp;l=0&amp;m=b&amp;v=6 Fryers Forest on WikiMaps]&lt;/ref&gt;).

Keyline design also includes principles of rapidly enhancing soil fertility. They are explored in ''Priority One'' by P. A. Yeomans' son, Allan. Yeomans and his sons were also instrumental in the design and production of special plows and other equipment for Keyline cultivation.

Label Propagation is a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm that assigns labels to previously unlabeled data points. At the start of the algorithm, a (generally small) subset of the data points have labels (or classifications). These labels are propagated to the unlabeled points throughout the course of the algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhu|first1=Xiaojin|title=Learning From Labeled and Unlabeled Data With Label Propagation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[complex networks]], real networks tend to have [[community structure]]. Label propagation is an algorithm &lt;ref name="raghavan-albert-kumara2007"&gt;U.N.Raghavan – R. Albert – S. Kumara [https://arxiv.org/abs/0709.2938 "Near linear time algorithm to detect community structures in large-scale networks"], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; for finding communities. In comparison with other algorithms&lt;ref&gt;M. E. J. Newman, [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/papers/epjb.pdf "Detecting community structure in networks"], 2004&lt;/ref&gt; label propagation has advantages in its running time and amount of a priori information needed about the network structure (no parameter is required to be known beforehand). The disadvantage is that it produces no unique solution, but an aggregate of many solutions.

==Functioning of the Algorithm==

At initial condition, the nodes carry a label that denotes the community they belong to. Membership in a community changes based on the labels that the neighboring nodes possess. This change is subject to the maximum number of labels within one degree of the nodes. Every node is initialized with a unique label, then the labels diffuse through the network. Consequently, densely connected groups reach a common label quickly. When many such dense (consensus) groups are created throughout the network, they continue to expand outwards until it is impossible to do so.&lt;ref name="raghavan-albert-kumara2007"/&gt;

The process has 5 steps:&lt;ref name="raghavan-albert-kumara2007"/&gt;

1. Initialize the labels at all nodes in the network. For a given node x, C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; (0) = x.

2. Set t = 1.

3. Arrange the nodes in the network in a random order and set it to X.

4. For each x ∈ X chosen in that specific order, let C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;(t) = f(C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(t), ...,C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;im&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(t),C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;i(m+1)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; (t − 1), ...,C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; (t − 1)). f here returns the label occurring with the highest frequency among neighbours.

5. If every node has a label that the maximum number of their neighbours have, then stop the algorithm. Else, set t = t + 1 and go to (3).

==Multiple Community Structure==

In contrast with other algorithms label propagation can result in various community structures from the same initial condition. The range of solutions can be narrowed if some nodes are given preliminary labels while others are held unlabelled. Consequently, unlabelled nodes will be more likely to adapt to the labelled ones. For a more accurate finding of communities, [[Jaccard index|Jaccard’s index]] is used to aggregate multiple community structures, containing all important information.&lt;ref name="raghavan-albert-kumara2007"/&gt;

In [[forensic science]], '''Locard's exchange principle'''  holds that the perpetrator of a crime will bring something into the crime scene and leave with something from it, and that both can be used as [[forensic evidence]]. Dr. [[Edmond Locard]] (13 December 1877 – 4 May 1966) was a pioneer in forensic science who became known as the [[Sherlock Holmes]] of France.&lt;ref&gt;http://aboutforensics.co.uk/edmond-locard/&lt;/ref&gt; He formulated the basic principle of forensic science as: "Every contact leaves a trace". Paul L. Kirk&lt;ref&gt;''Crime investigation: physical evidence and the police laboratory''. Interscience Publishers, Inc.: New York, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; expressed the principle as follows:

:"Wherever he steps, whatever he touches, whatever he leaves, even unconsciously, will serve as a silent witness against him. Not only his fingerprints or his footprints, but his hair, the fibers from his clothes, the glass he breaks, the tool mark he leaves, the paint he scratches, the blood or semen he deposits or collects. All of these and more, bear mute witness against him. This is evidence that does not forget. It is not confused by the excitement of the moment. It is not absent because human witnesses are. It is factual evidence. Physical evidence cannot be wrong, it cannot perjure itself, it cannot be wholly absent. Only human failure to find it, study and understand it, can diminish its value."

Fragmentary or [[trace evidence]] is any type of material left at (or taken from) a crime scene, or the result of contact between two surfaces, such as shoes and the floor covering or soil, or fibers from where someone sat on an upholstered chair.

When a crime is committed, fragmentary (or trace) evidence needs to be collected from the scene. A team of specialized police technicians goes to the scene of the crime and seals it off. They record video and take photographs of the crime scene, victim/s (if there are any) and items of evidence. If necessary, they undertake ballistics examinations. They check for foot, shoe, and tire mark impressions, plus hair as well as examine any vehicles and check for fingerprints - whole or partial.

==Famous cases==

The case studies below show how prevalent Locard's Exchange Principle is in each and every crime. The examples using Locard's Principle show not only how the transfer of trace evidence can tell the tale of what happened, but also how much care is required when collecting and evaluating trace evidence.

===The Weimar children murders===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
Karola and Melanie Weimar, aged 5 and 7, lived with their parents, Reinhard and Monika, in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Strate, Gerhard. [http://strate.net/en/publications/weimar_murder_case.html “The Weimar murder case – strength and risk of material evidence,"] Hamburg, 05/01/2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Monika Böttcher|Monika Böttcher.]]&lt;/ref&gt; They were reported missing on 4 August 1986. Their bodies were found on 7 August. They had been murdered.

Monika first said the children had breakfast, then went to a [[playground]]. Three weeks later she said they were already dead when she returned home the previous night: Reinhard was sitting on the edge of Karola's bed, weeping and confused; he then disposed of the bodies.

Both parents were suspected, but Monika was having an [[affair]], and was seen where Melanie's body was later found. She was convicted, but after serving her sentence, was released in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrichsen, Gisela. [http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/ende-eines-justizdramas-zweifache-kindsmoerderin-monika-boettcher-ist-frei-a-432435.html “End of a judicial drama: twice infanticide Monika Böttcher is free,"] Spiegel online Panorama, August 18, 2006. Retrieved December 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators determined what clothes Monika was wearing on 3 and 4 August, but not Reinhard's clothes, so only [[fibers]] from her clothing were identified on the children's bodies, yet they were also constantly in contact with him.

The [[bedding]] contained 14 fibers from Karola's [[T-shirt]]. Frictionless tests, simulating a dead child, matched that figure better than the friction tests, simulating a live child, so Karola could have lain lifelessly in bed wearing her T-shirt, as stated by her mother.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

35 fibers from Monika's [[blouse]] were found on the back of Melanie's T-shirt, but only one on her [[bed sheet]]. In tests, between 6 and 10 fibers remained on the sheet. These higher numbers were thought{{by whom|date=March 2016}} to disprove Monika's claim that she gave her child a goodbye [[hug]] the previous day. However, there are several likely explanations. For example, the bedding was put in one bag, so fibers from the sheet could have been transferred to the cover and [[pillow]]. Only the central area of the top of the sheet was taped: it might have originally contained more than one blouse fiber, the others could have been transferred to the back or sides while in the bag.

The blouse fibers on Melanie's clothing were distributed evenly, not the clusters expected from carrying the body.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

265 fibers from the family car’s rear seat covers were found on Melanie's [[panties]] and the inside of her trousers, but only a small number of fibers from the front seats was found on the children. This helped disprove the theory that they were killed on the front seats.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Melanie's clothes and hair were covered in 375 clinging fruits of [[Galium aparine|goosegrass]]. As some of these itchy things were on the inside of her trousers and on her panties, the trousers must have been put on her after death.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

No [[sand]] was found on the bodies or clothing (including socks and [[sandals]]) of either child, making the morning playground story unlikely.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

=== The Westerfield-van Dam case ===

[[David Westerfield|Danielle van Dam]], aged 7, lived with her parents and brothers in [[San Diego]], California. She was reported missing on 2 February 2002; her body was discovered on 27 February. Neighbor [[David Westerfield]] was almost immediately suspected, as he had gone [[camping]] in his [[RV]], and he was convicted of her [[kidnapping]] and murder.

Hairs consistent with the van Dams’ dog were found in his RV, also carpet fibers consistent with Danielle's [[bedroom]] carpet. Danielle's nightly [[ritual]] was to [[wrestle]] with the dog after getting into her [[pajamas]].&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly. [http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2002/06/25/export12739.txt “Hair in Westerfield home similar to Danielle's,"] North County Times, 24 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[prosecution]] argued that those hairs and fibers got onto her pajamas through that contact, and were then carried on the pajamas to first Westerfield's house and then to his RV, when he kidnapped her from her bed. The alternative scenario is that they got onto her daytime clothes, and those of her mother and younger brother, and were carried to his house when they visited him earlier that week selling [[cookies]].&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Alex. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020808-9999_1n8feldman.html “Lawyer says case against defendant is 'guesswork',"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 8 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; He said his laundry was out during that visit, so trace evidence from them could have got on it, and then been transferred to his bedroom and his RV (secondary Locard transfer).&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Steve, and Jeff Dillon. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020807-9999-final.html “Defense rests; each side puts its spin on evidence,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 7 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, his RV was often parked, sometimes unlocked, in the neighborhood streets, so Danielle could have sneaked inside, leaving behind that evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Alex. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020809-9999_1n9dusek.html “Jury begins deliberations: Prosecutor says victim has pointed to her killer,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 9 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

No trace of Westerfield was found in the van Dam house.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Jeff. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020806-9999-final.html “Physical evidence shows Westerfield committed 'evil, evil crime,' prosecutor says,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 6 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

14 hairs consistent with Danielle's were found in his environment. All but one were compared on only [[mitochondrial DNA]], so they might have come from her mother or a sibling.&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly. [http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2002/06/27/export12906.txt “DNA expert: Hair was Danielle's,"] North County Times, 26 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most (21) of the hairs were in a dryer [[lint (material)|lint]] ball in his [[waste container|trash can]], so they might have got in his laundry before the kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly. [http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2002/06/25/export12739.txt “Hair in Westerfield home similar to Danielle's,"] North County Times, 24 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 5 carpet fibers in his RV, but none in his house, suggesting those were deposited by someone going directly from her house to his RV, or they may have come from another house in that development.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Alex. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020625-9999_1m25hair.html “Criminalist links hairs, carpet fibers to Danielle: Evidence found in defendant's home,”] San Diego Union-Tribune, 25 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

No Danielle pajama or bedding fibers were reported in his environment. There was no trace evidence in his [[SUV]] (which casts doubt on the belief that she was transported from his house to his RV in his SUV).&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly.

'''Material criticality''' is the determination of which materials that flow through an [[industry]] or [[economy]] are most important to the production process. It is a sub-category within the field of [[material flow analysis]] (MFA), which is a method to [[quantitatively]] analyze the flows of materials used for industrial production in an industry or economy. MFA is a useful tool to assess what impacts materials used in the industrial process have and how efficiently a given process uses them.

Material criticality evaluation criteria consist of three dimensions: supply risk, vulnerability to supply restriction, and environmental implications. Supply risk comprises several components, and changes based on short or long-term temporal outlooks. Vulnerability to supply restriction is dependent on the organizational level (global, national, and corporate).&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt; This methodology was developed from a United States National Research Council model, and is intended to help stakeholders make strategic decisions about the materials used in their production process. In the globalized economy, scarcity of essential materials in the industrial supply chain is a growing concern. As a result, nations and other large institutions are increasingly analyzing a material’s criticality and seek to minimize any risk, restriction, or environmental impact associated with the material.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

== Supply risk ==
Supply risk is one of three dimensions that determine a material’s criticality. Supply risk can be evaluated for the medium term (5–10 years, typically most appropriate for corporations and governments) and the long term (multiple decades, usually considered by long-range planners, [[futurists]], and [[sustainability]] scholars). Supply risk consists of three components: [[Geological]], [[Technological]], and [[Economic]]; [[Social]] and [[Regulatory]]; [[Geopolitical]].&lt;ref name="metal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graedal|first=T.E.|author2=Rachael Barr|title=Methodology of Metal Criticality Determination|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|year=2012|volume=46|issue=2|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es203534z?mi=sppyl4&amp;af=R&amp;pageSize=20&amp;searchText=Pd+Au|accessdate=13 April 2013|doi=10.1021/es203534z}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first component focuses on the availability of the material’s supply and the last two focus on how access to that supply could be restricted. The components are assessed on a 0-100 scale for both medium and long-term risk with higher values indicating higher risk. The aggregated scores yield a material’s supply risk.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

=== Geological, Technological, and Economic ===

The geological, technological and economic components of supply risk relate to the most basic questions relating to a materials availability; geologically, how much (material) is there; technologically, is it feasible to obtain; and economically, is it practical to do so.  This component comprises two [[Economic indicator|indicator]]s of equal weight.  The first looks at the relative abundance of material resulting in "depletion time" or relatively how much of the material has not been consumed.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;  The second is a percentage of a given material extracted as a companion or trace material extracted as a by-product.  This is used to understand depletion rates of materials consumed as a by-product to extraction.

Quoting Graedel et al., "One should not regard the result as how long it will be until we run out, but rather as a useful relative indicator of the contemporary balance between supply and demand for the metal in question."   &lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

=== Social and Regulatory ===
The social and regulatory components of a materials supply risk can impede or expedite the development of [[mineral resources]].  Regulations can hinder the reliability of mineral resource supply.  Social perceptions towards the negative environmental and [[socioeconomic]] effects on communities typically fuel these regulations.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

Material criticality employs the policy potential index (PPI) and [[human development index]] (HDI) indicators to quantify the social and regulatory components of supply risk evaluation.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

=== Geopolitical ===
The geopolitical component of a material’s supply risk takes into account how governmental decisions and stability can significantly impact a material’s accessibility. For example, politically unstable and war-torn nations pose a greater risk to supply restriction than developed peaceful nations. Material concentration, geographic location, security, [[socio-economic]] distress, and political stability are all analyzed to address what amount the geopolitical component should factor into a material’s supply risk.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

=== Metal scarcity ===
Metals are among the most important materials to the [[industrialized]] world, everything from [[infrastructure]] to personal electronic devices heavily relies on metals for production. As a result, global supply is being increasingly monitored and examined. For example, a recent study analyzed the varying levels of risk to the [[copper]] metals around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graedel|first=T.E.|title=Criticality of the Geological Copper Family|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|year=2012|volume=46|issue=2|pages=1071–078|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es203535w|accessdate=13 April 2013|doi=10.1021/es203535w}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that increasing metal scarcity could alter typical industrial behavior.&lt;ref name="scarcity"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graedel|first=T.E.|author2=L. Erdmann|title=Will metal scarcity impede routine industrial use?|journal=MRS Bulletin|year=2012|volume=37|issue=4|pages=325–331|doi=10.1557/mrs.2012.34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also noted that metals heavily concentrated in certain geographic areas, such as [[strontium]] in [[China]] or the [[platinum]] group in [[South Africa]] and [[Russia]]; pose greater risk for supply disruptions.&lt;ref name="scarcity" /&gt;

Since the late 1990s [[China]] has had a near [[monopoly]] on a variety of [[rare-earth metals]] commonly used in every day products. Much to the surprise of the international trade community [[China]] began restricting exports of these metals in 2009.&lt;ref name="evans"&gt;{{cite news|last=Evans-Pritchard|first=Ambrose|title=Japan Breaks China's Stranglehold on Rare Metals with Sea-mud Bonanza|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/9951299/Japan-breaks-Chinas-stranglehold-on-rare-metals-with-sea-mud-bonanza.html|accessdate=13 April 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=24 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States|U.S.]] and [[World Trade Organization]] immediately protested however [[China]] has not changed its stance. This is a great example of a geopolitical based supply risk. To combat this supply disruption other countries, such as [[Japan]], are attempting new and innovative methods of [[mining]] these rare-earth metals.&lt;ref name="evans" /&gt;

== Vulnerability to Supply Restriction ==
Vulnerability to Supply Restriction (VSR) is an index that tells us how likely a particular [[Chemical element|element]] is to be restricted due to usage and availability. What evaluates the importance of a particular element at a social, economic and political level can be evaluated at three organizational levels; corporate, national and global levels.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt; In total, it comprises eight indicator categories for the Corporate and National level, and 4 for the Global.  VSR is important in evaluating each significant end-use applications of a material separately. The current approach realizes that indicators may be common or be specific for one to two. The three organizational levels use an adjusted 0-100 scale, including 4 bins, each with a range of 25 points. Quantifying the VSR is based on materials importance and substitutability, and an ability to innovate can be included at some organizational levels.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

=== Global ===
VSR at the Global level is focused on the intrinsic value of a material to the society of a country or countries and to what level a substitution is possible.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt; It is not a short term evaluation and none of its indicators are evaluated as such. The global levels matrix does not include as many categories as the Corporate and National level VSR evaluations are. They are only evaluated by the Importance and Substitutability.

''1) Importance''
This consists of an indicator labeled percentage of population utilizing.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

''2) Substitutability''
This comprises substitute performance, substitute availability, and the environmental impact ratio.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

=== National ===
Introduce national vulnerability to supply restriction: Looks at importance of an element, but does it through domestic [[industries]] and the country’s [[population]]. It is evaluated on either a short or long term, and can be regarded as more intermediate in time.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

''1) Importance''  Composed of two [[Economic indicator|indicator]]s: national economic importance and percentage of population utilizing element.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

''2) Substitutability''
Indicators are the same as at the corporate level except for that Price ratio is now labeled Net Importance price ratio.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

''3) Susceptibility''
This is no longer labeled “ability to innovate” as it was at the corporate level. It is now “Susceptibility” and its indicator is no longer Corporate Innovation. The focus is now (1) net importance reliance (2) global innovation index.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

=== Corporate ===
At the corporate level VSR is used to find the importance of an element in regards to (1) corporations current product lines (2) corporations Future product lines; with economic considerations each. (3) Ability to innovate. The corporate level is used to reinforce the belief that these innovative corporations are adapting more quickly to supply restriction. Emphasis on economic considerations. There is a development of sets of varied scenarios so that an estimate for how they might evolve is available.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

''1) Importance''
Two indicators: national economic importance and percentage of population utilizing.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

''2) Substitutability''
Substitutability evaluates (1) Substitute Performance (2) Substitute Availability (3) Environmental Impact Ration (4) Price Ratio. This evaluates the possible implications of an alternative material or metal in case the one at hand has a larger environmental impact or is in short supply.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

''3) Ability to Innovate''
A corporation that uses natural resources is dependent upon that resource and a disruption in its supply can impact revenues and market share. A competitor's ability to find a substitute or more efficient means of extraction could overtake a corporation.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

===Toyota vs Ford and Lithium===
[[File:NASA Lithium Ion Polymer Battery.jpg|thumb|Lithium Ion Battery]]

[[Lithium]] is used in [[Toyota]] and [[Ford]] cars' [[electric car]] batteries. Lithium is an ECE (energy critical elements) and is also a [[non-renewable resource]]. About 100 times more lithium is necessary in an electric car battery as is necessary for a standard laptop battery.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;Koerner. The Saudi Arabia of Lithium https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2008/1124/034.html/&lt;/ref&gt; With new practices of car companies trying to wane off fossil fuel usage, it is important to note the increased demand for lithium for automakers.

At the corporate level, lithium must be evaluated in terms of its importance to the company, and see to what extent a substitute is possible in short term values. It is important to note that both Ford and Toyota's current and most used batteries in Electric cars are [[Lithium-ion]]. Ford Motor company’s senior manager of energy storage research stated, “There are foreseen limits of lithium ion technology,” this was stated in coordination with a graph estimating a diminishing number by 2017. [http://seekingalpha.com/article/158653-the-limits-of-lithium-ion-batteries-according-to-ford]. According to Toyota’s environmental technology corporate strategy, “As Toyota anticipates the widespread use of electric vehicles in the future, we have begun research in developing next-generation secondary batteries with performance that greatly exceeds that of lithium-ion batteries.” &lt;ref&gt;Toyota. Research Progress: Next Generation Secondary Batteries. 2013. {{cite web |url=http://www.toyota-global.com/innovation/environmental_technology/next_generation_secondary_batteries.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407033031/http://www.toyota-global.com/innovation/environmental_technology/next_generation_secondary_batteries.html |archivedate=2013-04-07 |df= }} /&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lithium mine, Salar del Hombre Muerto, Argentina.jpg|thumb|left|Lithium mine, Salar del Hombre Muerto, Argentina]]At the National level, one would evaluate a nation in which lithium is in high supply. These include: [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Tibet]].&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt; The high demand of car companies and electric extensive products requiring lithium reserves would bring large revenues into these resource rich nations. Lithium production has a very large incentive for a country. A [[ton]] of lithium can sell for anywhere between $4500 and $5200, and the purer lithium that is used in batteries sells at the upper end of that interval. Bolivia’s current reserve is estimated to be around 100 million tons &lt;ref&gt;Bill Moore. And you thought Peak Oil Was Dead and Buried. 4/14/13 http://evworld.com/blogs.cfm?authorid=209&amp;blogid=1128/&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, the current market value of a ton of [[Zinc]] is measured to be $1929.15 &lt;ref&gt;Zinc http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=zinc/&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, at the Global level, oftentimes highly developed countries are the ones extracting resources and bringing industry into these poorer countries. In terms of the population utilizing lithium, there is a relatively large amount of people using lithium, with technology encompassing a large percent of our interactions and activities in the world.
With some villages in [[Africa]] operating more cell phones than bathrooms, it is reasonable to estimate a large percent of the world uses lithium, and to predict that the material usage will increase as industrialization and technological dependency grows.&lt;ref&gt;New World. Lithium Facts. A New Age of Mineral Exploration in the Americas. ''New World Resource Corporation''. {{cite web |url=http://www.newworldresource.com/s/AboutLithium.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610040040/http://www.newworldresource.com/s/AboutLithium.asp |archivedate=2013-06-10 |df= }} /&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of Toyota and Ford’s lithium usage, it is important to note that as of 2005, global zinc air production could produce enough [[Zinc–air battery|zinc-air batteries]] to power 1 billion electric vehicles, and lithium reserves could only power ten million lithium-ion powered vehicles [http://lithiuminvestingnews.com/4346/electric-vehicles-given-global-initiative/].

== Environmental implication ==
[[File:Falu Gruva2.jpg|thumbnail|right|Copper Mine]]
The burden that various materials impose on the environment is considered in material criticality. There are numerous negative effects that materials can have on the environment due to either their toxicity, the amounts of energy and water used in processing, and their emissions into the air, water and the land. The purpose of including an evaluation of environmental implications is to transfer information on potential impacts of using a specific material to product designers, government officials, and nongovernmental agencies.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

The environmental implication evaluation can use data from a source like the  [http://www.ecoinvent.ch/ Ecoinvent Database]. The ecoinvent database provides a single score for the negative impact to human health and ecosystems on a scale from 0-100. The scope of the score is [[Life-cycle assessment|Cradle to Gate]].&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt;

Environmental implications can also be reflected in social attitudes that may pose as a barrier to the development of resources in the form of objections to extraction. These objections may arise from a fear of how the new extraction site could potentially negatively impact the surrounding communities and ecosystems.&lt;ref name="metal" /&gt; This barrier can affect the reliability and security of resources.

Improved technology and infrastructure in the recycling re-use, and more efficient use of materials could mitigate some of the negative environmental impacts associated with them. This could also improve the reliability and security of resources.

An example of environmental implications is the ban on [[lead]] (Pb) in many products. Once government officials and product designers became aware of the dangers of lead government and company policies started prohibiting its use.

== Criticality focus ==
Material criticality is a relatively new area of focus. As global industrial activity continues to increase a wide array of stakeholders are paying more attention to material criticality in order to assess how production processes may be impacted and made more efficient. British Petroleum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Petroleum|url=http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/STAGING/global_assets/e_s_assets/e_s_assets_2010/downloads_pdfs/Materials_March2012.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United States Department of Energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov/pi/office-policy-and-international-affairs/initiatives/department-energy-s-critical-materials|publisher=The Department of Energy|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the European Union&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raw materials|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/raw-materials/critical/|publisher=The European Union|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  have all established review procedures to determine material criticality and how it affects their behavior. Additionally, there has been a growing body of academic study in this field, led by Thomas Graedel of Yale. Material criticality is going to be an essential factor in the industrial production process for the foreseeable future.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11017">'''Moral skepticism''' (or '''moral scepticism''') is a [[Class (philosophy)|class]] of  [[Meta-ethics|metaethical]] theories all members of which [[logical consequence|entail]] that no one has any moral knowledge. Many moral skeptics also make the stronger, [[Modal logic|modal]] claim that [[Moral nihilism|moral knowledge is impossible]]. Moral skepticism is particularly opposed to [[moral realism]]: the view that there are knowable and objective moral truths.

Some defenders of moral skepticism include [[Pyrrho]], [[Aenesidemus]], [[Sextus Empiricus]], [[David Hume]], [[J. L. Mackie]] (1977), [[Max Stirner]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Richard Joyce (philosopher)|Richard Joyce]] (2001), [[Michael Ruse]], Joshua Greene, Richard Garner, [[Walter Sinnott-Armstrong]] (2006b), and the psychologist [[Jim Flynn (academic)|James Flynn]]. Strictly speaking, [[Gilbert Harman]] (1975) argues in favor of a kind of [[moral relativism]], not moral skepticism. However, he has influenced some contemporary moral skeptics.

==Forms of moral skepticism==
Moral skepticism divides into three subclasses: moral error theory (or [[moral nihilism]]), epistemological moral skepticism, and [[Non-cognitivism|noncognitivism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism-moral/ Moral Skepticism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; All three of these theories share the same conclusions, which are:

:(a) we are never justified in believing that moral claims (claims of the form "state of affairs x is good," "action y is morally obligatory," etc.) are true and, even more so
:(b) we never know that any moral claim is true.

However, each method arrives at (a) and (b) by different routes.

Moral error theory holds that we do not know that any moral claim is true because
:(i) all moral claims are false,
:(ii) we have reason to believe that all moral claims are false, and so, because
:(iii) since we are not justified in believing any claim we have reason to deny, we are not justified in believing any moral claims.

Epistemological moral skepticism is a subclass of theory, the members of which include [[Pyrrhonian]] moral skepticism and dogmatic moral skepticism. All members of epistemological moral skepticism share two things in common: first they acknowledge that we are unjustified in believing any moral claim, and second, they are [[agnostic]] on whether (i) is true (i.e. on whether all moral claims are false).
*Pyrrhonian moral skepticism holds that the reason we are unjustified in believing any moral claim is that it is irrational for us to believe either that any moral claim is true or that any moral claim is false. Thus, in addition to being agnostic on whether (i) is true, Pyrrhonian moral skepticism denies (ii).
*Dogmatic moral skepticism, on the other hand, ''affirms'' (ii) and cites (ii)'s truth as the reason we are unjustified in believing any moral claim.

Finally, Noncognitivism holds that we can never know that any moral claim is true because moral claims are ''incapable'' of being true or false (they are not [[truth-apt]]). Instead, moral claims are [[Universal prescriptivism|imperatives]] (e.g. "Don't steal babies!"), [[emotivism|expressions of emotion]] (e.g. "stealing babies: Boo!"), or [[expressivism|expressions of "pro-attitudes"]] ("I do not believe that babies should be stolen.")

==Moral error theory==
Moral [[error theory]] is a position characterized by its commitment to two propositions: (i) all moral claims are false and (ii) we have reason to believe that all moral claims are false. The most famous moral error theorist is J. L. Mackie, who defended the metaethical view in ''Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong'' (1977). Mackie has been interpreted as giving two arguments for moral error theory.

The first argument people attribute to Mackie, often called the [[argument from queerness]],&lt;ref&gt;D. Brink, "Moral Realism and the Skeptical Arguments from Disagreement and Queerness," ''Australasian Journal of Philosophy'' 62 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; holds that moral claims imply motivation internalism (the doctrine that "It is necessary and ''a priori'' that any agent who judges that one of his available actions is morally obligatory will have some (defeasible) motivation to perform that action" &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Joyce, Richard (2001). ''The Myth of Morality'', [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;). Because motivation internalism is false, however, so too are all moral claims.

The other argument often attributed to Mackie, often called the argument from disagreement,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; maintains that any moral claim (e.g. "Killing babies is wrong") entails a correspondent "reasons claim" ("one has reason not to kill babies"). Put another way, if "killing babies is wrong" is true then everybody has a reason to not kill babies. This includes the psychopath who takes great pleasure from killing babies, and is utterly miserable when he does not have their blood on his hands. But, surely, (if we assume that he will suffer no reprisals) this psychopath has every reason to kill babies, and no reason not to do so. All moral claims are thus false.

==Epistemological moral skepticism==
All versions of epistemological moral skepticism hold that we are unjustified in believing any moral proposition. However, in contradistinction to moral error theory, epistemological moral skeptical arguments for this conclusion do not include the premise that "all moral claims are false." For example, Michael Ruse &lt;ref&gt;M. Ruse, ''Taking Darwin Seriously'' (Oxford: [[Basil Blackwell]], 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; gives what Richard Joyce &lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;  calls an "evolutionary argument" for the conclusion that we are unjustified in believing any moral proposition. He argues that we have evolved to believe moral propositions because our believing the same enhances our genetic fitness (makes it more likely that we will reproduce successfully). However, our believing these propositions would enhance our fitness even if they were all false (they would make us more cooperative, etc.). Thus, our moral beliefs are unresponsive to evidence; they are analogous to the beliefs of a [[paranoiac]]. As a paranoiac is plainly unjustified in believing his [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], so too are we unjustified in believing moral propositions. We therefore have reason to jettison our moral beliefs.

==Consequences==

There are two different opinions that may follow from moral skepticism.

[[Amoralism]] is the idea that we should abandon morality.

[[John E. Hare]] claims there are some reasons to obey moral rules. He claims that amoralists are logically consistent, but have plenty of disadvantages in their lives.&lt;ref name="Gressis"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gressis|first1=Robert|title=God and Morality: A Philosophical History, Reviewed|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23248-god-and-morality-a-philosophical-history/|website=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=8 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018164107/http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23248-god-and-morality-a-philosophical-history/|archivedate=18 October 2015|date=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Criticisms of moral skepticism come primarily from [[moral realism|moral realists]]. The moral realist argues that there is in fact good reason to believe that there are objective moral truths and that we are justified in holding many moral beliefs. One moral realist response to moral error theory holds that it "proves too much"—if moral claims are false because they entail that we have reasons to do certain things regardless of our preferences, then so too are "hypothetical imperatives" (e.g. "if you want to get your hair-cut you ought to go to the barber"). This is because all hypothetical imperatives imply that "we have reason to do that which will enable us to accomplish our ends" and so, like moral claims, they imply that we have reason to do something ''regardless'' of our preferences.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/teaching_staff/lillehammer/CIG-chapter3.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616140214/http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/teaching_staff/lillehammer/CIG-chapter3.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-16 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

If moral claims are false because they have this implication, then so too are hypothetical imperatives. But hypothetical imperatives are true. Thus the argument from the non-instantiation of (what Mackie terms) "objective prescriptivity" for moral error theory fails. Russ Shafer-Landau and Daniel Callcut have each outlined anti-skeptical strategies. Callcut argues that moral skepticism should be scrutinized in introductory ethics classes in order to get across the point that "if all views about morality, including the skeptical ones, face difficulties, then adopting a skeptical position is not an escape from difficulty."
&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Callcut, “The Value of Teaching Moral Skepticism,” in ''Teaching Philosophy'' Volume 29, Number 3 (Sept 2006), p.231, paper online at http://philpapers.org/archive/CALTVO-2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''On Numbers and Games''''' is a [[mathematics]] book by [[John Horton Conway]] first published in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fraenkel, Aviezri S.|authorlink=Aviezri Fraenkel|title=Review: ''On numbers and games'', by J. H. Conway; and ''Surreal numbers'', by D. E. Knuth|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.|year=1978|volume=84|issue=6|pages=1328–1336|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1978-84-06/S0002-9904-1978-14564-9/S0002-9904-1978-14564-9.pdf|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1978-14564-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is  written by a pre-eminent mathematician, and is directed at other mathematicians. The material is, however, developed in a playful and unpretentious manner and many chapters are accessible to non-mathematicians.  [[Martin Gardner]] discussed the book at length, particularly Conway's construction of [[Surreal number]]s, in his [[List of Martin Gardner Mathematical Games columns|Mathematical Games column]] in ''Scientific American'' in September 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mathematical-games-1976-09/ Mathematical Games, September 1976] ''[[Scientific American]]'' Volume 235, Issue 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is roughly divided into two sections: the first half (or ''Zeroth Part''), on [[number]]s, the second half (or ''First Part''), on [[combinatorial game theory|games]]. In the first section, Conway provides an [[axiomatic]] construction of numbers and [[ordinal arithmetic]], namely, the [[integer]]s, [[Real number|real]]s, the [[countable infinity]], and entire towers of infinite [[ordinal number|ordinals]], using a notation that is essentially an almost trite (but critically important) variation of the [[Dedekind cut]]. As such, the construction is rooted in [[axiomatic set theory]], and is closely related to the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms]]. The section also covers what Conway (adopting Knuth's nomenclature) termed the "[[surreal number]]s".

Conway then notes that, in this notation, the numbers in fact belong to a larger [[class (set theory)|class]], the class of all two-player games. The axioms for [[greater than]] and [[less than]] are seen to be a natural ordering on games, corresponding to which of the two players may win. The remainder of the book is devoted to exploring a number of different (non-traditional, mathematically inspired) two-player games, such as [[nim]], [[hackenbush]], and the [[map-coloring games]] [[col (game)|col]] and [[Snort (game)|snort]]. The development includes their scoring, a review of [[Sprague–Grundy theorem]], and the inter-relationships to numbers, including their relationship to [[infinitesimal]]s.

The book was first published by Academic Press Inc in 1976, {{isbn|0-12-186350-6}}, and re-released by AK Peters in 2000 ({{isbn|1-56881-127-6}}).

==Synopsis==
A game in the sense of Conway is a position in a contest between two players, '''Left''' and '''Right'''.  Each player has a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of games called ''options'' to choose from in turn.  Games are written {L|R} where L is the set of '''Left's''' options and R is the set of '''Right's''' options.&lt;ref&gt;Alternatively, we often list the elements of the sets of options to save on braces.  This causes no confusion as long as we can tell whether a singleton option is a game or a set of games.&lt;/ref&gt; At the start there are no games at all, so the [[empty set]] (i.e., the set with no members) is the only set of options we can provide to the players.  This defines the game {|}, which is called [[zero game|0]].  We consider a player who must play a turn but has no options to have lost the game.  Given this game 0 there are now two possible sets of options, the empty set and the set whose only element is zero.  The game {0|} is called 1, and the game {|0} is called -1.  The game {0|0} is called [[star (game theory)|* (star)]], and is the first game we find that is not a number.

All numbers are [[sign (mathematics)|positive, negative, or zero]], and we say that a game is positive if '''Left''' will win, negative if '''Right''' will win, or zero if the second player will win.  Games that are not numbers have a fourth possibility: they may be [[fuzzy game|fuzzy]], meaning that the first player will win.  * is a fuzzy game.&lt;ref&gt;Dierk Schleicher and Michael Stoll, [https://arxiv.org/abs/math.CO/0410026 ''An Introduction to Conway's Games and Numbers''], Moscow Math Journal 6 2 (2006), 359-388&lt;/ref&gt;

As of this writing, a physics engine called [[Sibernetic]] has been built for the project and models of the neural [[connectome]] and a muscle cell have been created in [[NeuroML]] format.

__TOC__

== Background: ''C. elegans'' ==
The roundworm ''C. elegans'' has one of the simplest nervous systems of any organism, with its [[hermaphrodite]] type having only 302 neurons. Furthermore, the structural [[connectome]] of these neurons is fully worked out. There are fewer than one thousand cells in the whole body of a ''C. elegans'' worm, and because ''C. Elegans'' is a [[model organism]], each has a unique identifier and comprehensive supporting literature. Being a model organism, the genome is fully known, along with many well characterized mutants readily available, a comprehensive literature of behavioural studies, etc. With so few neurons and new calcium 2 photon microscopy techniques it should soon be possible to record the complete neural activity of a living organism. By manipulating the neurons through optogenetic techniques, combined with the above recording capacities the project is in an unprecedented position to be able to fully characterize the neural dynamics of an entire organism.

In the process of trying to build an "in silico" model of a relatively simple organism like ''C. elegans'', new tools are being developed which will make it easier to model progressively more complex organisms.

===NemaLoad===

Project Nemaload &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121007022842/http://nemaload.davidad.org/ NemaLoad]&lt;/ref&gt; was created as a research program trying to empirically establish the relevant biological facts which are necessary for a true bottom-up simulation. The project founder, [[David Dalrymple (computer scientist)|David Dalrymple]], is a collaborator on the OpenWorm project.

==OpenWorm project==

Although the ultimate goal is to simulate all features of ''C. elegans''' behaviour, the project is new and the first behaviour the Open Worm community decided to simulate is a simple motor response: teaching the worm to crawl. To do so, the virtual worm must be placed in a virtual environment. A full feedback loop must be established: Environmental Stimulus &gt; Sensory Transduction &gt; Interneuron Firing &gt; Motor Neuron Firing &gt; Motor Output &gt; Environmental Change &gt; Sensory Transduction.

There are two main technical challenges here: modelling the neural/electrical properties of the brain as it processes the information, and modelling the mechanical properties of the body as it moves. The neural properties are being modeled by a [[Hodgkin-Huxley model]], and the mechanical properties are being modeled by a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic algorithm.

The OpenWorm team built an engine called Geppetto which could integrate these algorithms and due to its modularity will be able to model other biological systems (like [[digestion]]) which the team will tackle at a later time.

The team also built an environment called NeuroConstruct which is able to output neural structures in [[NeuroML]]. Using NeuroConstruct the team reconstructed the full connectome of ''C. elegans''.

Using NeuroML the team has also built a model of a muscle cell. Note that these models currently only model the relevant properties for the simple motor response: the neural/electrical and the mechanical properties discussed above.

The next step is to connect this muscle cell to the six neurons which synapse on it and approximate their effect.

The rough plan is to then both:
* Approximate the synapses which synapse on those neurons
* Repeat the process for other muscle cells

===Progress===
As of January 2015, the project is still awaiting peer review, and researchers involved in the project are reluctant to make bold claims about its current resemblance to biological behavior; project coordinator Stephen Larson estimates that they are "only 20 to 30 percent of the way towards where we need to get".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/21/tech/mci-lego-worm/ |title=Scientists upload a worm's mind into a Lego robot |work=CNN |last=Shadbolt |first=Peter |date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Japanese researchers announced the Perfect C. elegans Project. A proposal was submitted, but the project appears to have been abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kitano|first=Hiroaki|last2=Hamahashi|first2=Shugo|last3=Luke|first3=Sean|date=April 1998|title=The Perfect C.

In 2004 a group from Hiroshima began the Virtual C. elegans Project. They released two papers which showed how their simulation would retract from virtual prodding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_152.pdf |title=A dynamic body model of the Nematode C. elegans with neural oscillators |journal=Journal of Robotics and Mechatronics |volume=17 |issue=3 |date=2005 |first1=Michiyo |last1=Suzuki |first2=Takeshi |last2=Goto |first3=Toshio |last3=Tsuji |first4=Hisao |last4=Ohtake |pages=318–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suzuki|first=Michiyo|last2=Tsuji|first2=Toshio|last3=Ohtake|first3=Hisao|date=September 2005|title=A model of motor control of the nematode C. elegans with neuronal circuits|url=http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_153.pdf|journal=Artificial Intelligence in Medicine|volume=35|issue=1-2|pages=75–86|doi=10.1016/j.artmed.2005.01.008|issn=0933-3657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 a Texas researcher described a simplified C. elegans simulator based on a 1-wire network incorporating a digital Parallax Basic Stamp processor, sensory inputs and motor outputs. Inputs employed 16-bit A/D converters attached to operational amplifier simulated neurons and a 1-wire temperature sensor. Motor outputs were controlled by 256-position digital potentiometers and 8-bit digital ports. Artificial muscle action was based on Nitinol actuators. It used a "sense-process-react" operating loop which recreated several instinctual behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Paul |last=Frenger |title=Simple C. elegans Nervous System Emulator |conference=Houston Conference for Biomedical Engineering Research |date=2005 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These early attempts of simulation have been criticized for not being biologically realistic. Although we have the complete structural connectome, we do not know the [[synaptic weight]]s at each of the known synapses. We do not even know whether the synapses are inhibitory or excitatory. To compensate for this the Hiroshima group used machine learning to find some weights of the synapses which would generate the desired behaviour. It is therefore no surprise that the model displayed the behaviour, and it may not represent true understanding of the system.

==Open science==
The Open Worm community is committed to the ideals of [[open science]]. Generally this means that the team will try to publish in open access journals and include all data gathered (to avoid the file drawer problem). Indeed, all the biological data the team has gathered is publicly available, and the five publications the group has made so far are available for free on their website. All the software that OpenWorm has produced is completely free and open source.

Open Worm is also trying a radically open model of scientific collaboration. The team consists of anyone who wishes to be a part of it. There are over one hundred "members" who are signed up for the high volume technical mailing list. Of the most active members who are named on a publication there are collaborators from Russia, Brazil, England, Scotland, Ireland and the United States. To coordinate this international effort, the team uses "virtual lab meetings" and other online tools that are detailed in the resources section.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15719">An '''origin myth''' is a [[myth]] that purports to describe the origin of some feature of the natural or social world. One type of origin myth is the [[creation myth|cosmogonic myth]], which describes the creation of the world. However, many cultures have stories set after the cosmogonic myth, which describe the origin of natural phenomena and human institutions within a preexisting universe.

In [[classics|Western classical scholarship]], the terms '''etiological myth''' and '''''aition''''' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] αἴτιον, "cause") are sometimes used for a myth that explains an origin, particularly how an object or custom came into existence.

Every origin myth is a tale of creation: origin myths describe how some new reality came into existence.&lt;ref name = "eliade"&gt;Eliade, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, origin myths also justify the established order by explaining that it was established by sacred forces&lt;ref name = "eliade"&gt;Eliade, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; (see section on "Social function" below). The distinction between cosmogonic myths and origin myths is not clear-cut. A myth about the origin of some part of the world necessarily presupposes the existence of the world—which, for many cultures, presupposes a cosmogonic myth. In this sense, one can think of origin myths as building upon and extending their cultures' cosmogonic myths.&lt;ref name = "eliade"&gt;Eliade, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in traditional cultures, the recitation of an origin myth is often prefaced with the recitation of the cosmogonic myth.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, pp. 21-24&lt;/ref&gt;

In some academic circles, the term "myth" properly refers only to origin and cosmogonic myths. For example, many [[folklorists]] reserve the label "myth" for stories about creation. Traditional stories that do not focus on origins fall into the categories of "[[legend]]" and "[[Folklore|folk tale]]", which folklorists distinguish from myth.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Mircea Eliade]], for many traditional cultures, nearly every sacred story qualifies as an origin myth. Traditional humans tend to model their behavior after sacred events, seeing their life as an "[[Eternal return (Eliade)|eternal return]]" to the mythical age. Because of this conception, nearly every sacred story describes events that established a new paradigm for human behavior, and thus nearly every sacred story is a story about a creation.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Eliade, pp. 17-19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social function==
{{See also|Myth and ritual|Eternal return (Eliade)}}
An origin myth often functions to justify the current state of affairs. In traditional cultures, the entities and forces described in origin myths are often considered sacred. Thus, by attributing the state of the universe to the actions of these entities and forces, origin myths give the current order an aura of sacredness: "Myths reveal that the World, man, and life have a supernatural origin and history, and that this history is significant, precious, and exemplary."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Many cultures instil the expectation that people take mythical gods and heroes as their [[role model]]s, imitating their deeds and upholding the customs they established:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the missionary and ethnologist C. Strehlow asked the Australian Arunta why they performed certain ceremonies, the answer was always: "Because the ancestors so commanded it." The Kai of New Guinea refused to change their way of living and working, and they explained: "It was thus that the Nemu (the Mythical Ancestors) did, and we do likewise." Asked the reason for a particular detail in a ceremony, a Navaho chanter answered: "Because the Holy People did it that way in the first place." We find exactly the same justification in the prayer that accompanies a primitive Tibetan ritual: "As it has been handed down from the beginning of the earth’s creation, so must we sacrifice. … As our ancestors in ancient times did—so do we now."&lt;ref&gt;
Eliade, pp. 6–7
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Founding myths unite people and tend to include mystical events along the way to make "founders" seem more desirable and heroic. Ruling monarchs or aristocracies may allege descent from mythical founders/gods/heroes in order to legitimate their control. For example: [[Julius Caesar]] and his relatives claimed [[Aeneas]] (and through Aeneas, the goddess [[Venus]]) as an ancestor.

==Founding myth==
[[File:René-Antoine Houasse - The Dispute of Minerva and Neptune, 1689.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|''The Dispute of [[Minerva]] and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]'' ({{circa}} 1689 or 1706) by [[René-Antoine Houasse]], depicting the founding myth of [[Athens]]]]

A "founding myth" or [[Etiology|etiological]] myth (Greek ''aition'') explains either:

* the origins of a [[ritual]] or of the founding of a city
* the [[ethnogenesis]] of a group presented as a [[genealogy]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Herwig Wolfram]], ''The History of the Goths'', Thomas J. Dunlap, tr., especially "Gothic history as historical ethnography", 1988:1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[founding father]] and thus of a nation (''natio'', "birth")
* the spiritual origins of a belief, philosophy, discipline, or idea - presented as a narrative

A founding myth may serve as the primary ''[[exemplum]]'', as the myth of [[Ixion]] was the original Greek example of a murderer rendered unclean by his crime, who needed cleansing (''[[catharsis]]'') of his impurity.

Founding myths feature prominently in [[Greek mythology]]. "Ancient Greek rituals were bound to prominent local groups and hence to specific localities", [[Walter Burkert]] has observed.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Homo Necans'' (1972) 1983:83.&lt;/ref&gt; "i.e. the sanctuaries and altars that had been set up for all time". Thus Greek and Hebrew founding myths established the special relationship between a deity and local people, who traced their origins from a [[hero]] and authenticated their ancestral rights through the founding myth. Greek founding myths often embody a justification for the ancient overturning of an older, archaic order, reformulating a historical event anchored in the social and natural world to valorize current community practices, creating symbolic narratives of "collective importance"&lt;ref&gt;Myth as "narratives of collective importance" is often part of the definition of myth, both Greek and other; see [[Walter Burkert]], ''Structure and history in Greek mythology and ritual'', 1982:23; Jan N. Bremmer, ''Interpretations of Greek mythology'', "What is a Greek myth?" 1987:1; Mark P. O. Morford and Robert J. Lenardon, ''Classical Mythology'' 1999:12.&lt;/ref&gt; enriched with metaphor in order to account for traditional chronologies, and constructing an etiology considered to be plausible among those with a cultural investment.&lt;ref&gt;These structures of Greek foundation myths within their historical and cultural contexts, and the particular example of the founding of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], are analysed, in terms first laid out by [[Georges Dumézil]], by [[Claude Calame]], ''Myth and History in Ancient Greece: the symbolic creation of a colony'' rev. tr. of ''Mythe et histoire dans l'antiquité grecque'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Greek view, the mythic past had deep roots in ''historic'' time, its legends treated as facts, as Carlo Brillante has noted,&lt;ref&gt;Brillante, "Myth and history: the historical interpretation of myth" in L. Edmunds, ''Approaches to Greek Myth'' (1991, pp.&amp;nbsp;91&amp;ndash;140.&lt;/ref&gt; its heroic protagonists seen as links between the "age of origins" and the mortal, everyday world that succeeded it. A modern translator of [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius]]' ''[[Argonautica]]'' has noted, of the many ''aitia'' embedded as digressions in that Hellenistic epic, that "crucial to social stability had to be the function of myths in providing explanations, authorization or empowerment for the present in terms of origins: this could apply, not only to foundations or charter myths and [[genealogical tree]]s (thus supporting family or territorial claims) but also to personal moral choices."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Green, Introduction to ''Argonautika'', expanded ed. 2007, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In the period after [[Alexander the Great]] expanded the [[Hellenistic]] world, Greek poetry—[[Callimachus]] wrote a whole work simply titled ''[[Aitia]]''—is replete with founding myths. Simon Goldhill employs the metaphor of [[sedimentation]] in describing Apollonius' laying down of layers "where each object, cult, ritual, name, may be opened... into a narrative of origination, and where each narrative, each event, may lead to a cult, ritual, name, monument."&lt;ref&gt;Goldhill, "The paradigms of epic: Apollonius Rhodius and the examples of the past", in ''The Poet's Voice: Essays on Poetics and Greek Literature'' (1991), ch. 5, pp.&amp;nbsp;284&amp;ndash;333, noted in Peter Green 2007, note on ''Argonautica'' I.1070&amp;ndash;77, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable example is the myth of the foundation of Rome—the tale of [[Romulus and Remus]], which [[Virgil]] in turn broadens in his ''[[Aeneid]]'' with the odyssey of [[Aeneas]] and his razing of [[Lavinium]], and his son [[Iulus]]'s later relocation and rule of the famous twins' birthplace [[Alba Longa]], and their descent from his royal line, thus fitting perfectly into the already established canon of events. Similarly, the Old Testament's story of [[the Exodus]] serves as the founding myth for the community of Israel, telling how [[Israelite God|God]] delivered the [[Israelites]] from slavery and how they therefore belonged to him through the [[sinaitic covenant|Covenant of Mount Sinai]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CiqF7sVqDQcC&amp;pg=PA73 Kenton L. Sparkes, ''Genre Criticism'', in Thomas Dozeman (ed), :Methods for Exodus", CUP, 2010, p.73]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, founding myths of the [[medieval commune]]s of northern Italy manifested the increasing self-confidence of the urban population and the will to find a Roman origin, however tenuous and legendary. In 13th-century [[Padua]], when each commune looked for a Roman founder - and if one was not available, invented one—a legend had been current in the city, attributing its foundation to the Trojan [[Antenor (mythology)|Antenor]].&lt;ref&gt;
[[Roberto Weiss]], ''The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity'' (Oxford: Blackwell) 1973:18.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Larger-than-life heroes continue to bolster the origin-myths of many newer nations and societies. In modern-era colonial contexts, waves of individuals and groups come to the fore in popular history as shaping and exemplifying the ideals of a group: explorers followed by conquerors followed by developers/exploiters. Note for example the [[conquistador]]s of the Iberian empires, the [[bandeirantes]] in Brazil, the [[coureur des bois|coureurs des bois]] in Canada, the [[Cossack]]s and the [[promyshlenniki]] in Siberia and in Alaska, the bands of [[American pioneer|pioneer]]s in the central and western United States, and the [[Great Trek|voortrekker]]s in Southern Africa.

==Foundation stories==
'''Foundational stories''' are accounts of the development of [[city|cities]] and [[nation]]s. A foundational story represents the view that the creation of the city is a human achievement. Human control and the removal of ''wild, uncontrolled'' nature is underlined. There are two versions of foundational stories: ''civilization story'' and ''degradation story''.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, John; [[Doreen Massey (geographer)|Doreen B. Massey]], Michael Pryke, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Uay0a7V6yZYC&amp;pg=PA141 Unsettling Cities]'' Routledge 1999 {{ISBN|978-0-415-20072-1}} p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

''Civilization stories'' take a view of [[nature]] as dangerous and wild. The development of the city is seen as a successful distancing of humans from nature. Nature is locked out, and humans take pride in doing so successfully. In 1984 the geographer [[Yi-Fu Tuan]] suggested ranking cities according to their distance to natural rhythms and cycles.

''Degradation stories'' (also called ''pollution stories'') take a different stance. The city is seen as spoiling the landscape of the ecological relations that existed before the city was established. There is a sense of guilt for degrading the intact system of nature. In degradation stories true nature only exists outside the city.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2248">A '''power structure''' is an overall system of influence relationships between any individual and every other individual within any selected group of people. A description of a power structure would capture the way in which [[Power (social and political)|power]] or [[authority]] is distributed between people within groups such as a government, nation, institution, organization, or a society.&lt;ref&gt;G. William Domhoff, Thomas R. Dye, ''Power Elites and Organizations'' (1987), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Such structures are of interest to various fields, including [[sociology]], [[government]], [[economics]], and [[business]]. A power structure may be formal and intentionally constructed to maximize values like [[Social justice|fairness]] or [[efficiency]], as in a [[hierarchical organization]] wherein every entity, except one, is subordinate to a single other entity. Conversely, a power structure may be an informal set of roles, such as those found in a [[dominance hierarchy]] in which members of a social group interact, often aggressively, to create a ranking system. A culture that is organised in a dominance hierarchy is a [[dominator culture]], the opposite of an egalitarian culture of partnership. A visible, dominant group or elite that holds power or authority within a power structure is often referred to as being [[the Establishment]]. Power structures are fluid, with changes occurring constantly, either slowly or rapidly, evolving or revolutionary, peacefully or violently.

In [[information science]], '''profiling''' refers to the process of construction and application of [[user profile]]s generated by computerized [[data analysis]].

This is the use of algorithms or other mathematical techniques that allow the [[pattern recognition|discovery of patterns]] or [[correlation]]s in large quantities of data, aggregated in [[database]]s. When these patterns or correlations are used to identify or represent people, they can be called ''profiles''. Other than a discussion of profiling ''technologies'' or ''population profiling'', the notion of profiling in this sense is not just about the construction of profiles, but also concerns the ''application'' of [[group profile]]s to individuals, e.&amp;nbsp;g., in the cases of [[credit scoring]], price discrimination, or identification of security risks {{Harv|Hildebrandt|Gutwirth|2008}} {{Harv|Elmer|2004}}.

{{wiktionary|profile}}

Profiling is not simply a matter of computerized pattern-recognition; it enables refined price-discrimination, [[targeted advertising|targeted servicing]], [[fraud detection]], and extensive [[social sorting]]. Real-time machine profiling constitutes the precondition for emerging [[socio-technical]] infrastructures envisioned by advocates of [[ambient intelligence]],&lt;ref&gt;
ISTAG (2001), Scenarios for Ambient Intelligence in 2010, Information Society Technology Advisory Group
&lt;/ref&gt; [[autonomic computing]] {{Harv|Kephart|Chess|2003}} and [[ubiquitous computing]] {{Harv|Weiser|1991}}.

One of the most challenging problems of the [[information society]] involves dealing with increasing data-overload. With the [[digitizing]] of all sorts of content as well as the improvement and drop in cost of recording technologies, the amount of available information has become enormous and increases exponentially. It has thus become important for companies, governments, and individuals to discriminate [[signal-to-noise ratio|information from noise]], detecting useful or interesting data. The development of profiling technologies must be seen against this background.{{cn|date=February 2014}} These technologies are thought{{by whom?|date=February 2014}} to efficiently collect and analyse data in order to find or test knowledge in the form of statistical patterns between data. This process, called [[Knowledge Discovery in Databases]] (KDD) {{Harv|Fayyad|Piatetsky-Shapiro|Smyth|1996}}, provides the profiler with sets of correlated data usable as "profiles".

== The profiling process ==

The technical process of profiling can be separated in several steps:
* ''Preliminary grounding:'' The profiling process starts with a specification of the applicable problem domain and the identification of the goals of analysis.
* ''[[Data collection]]:'' The target dataset or database for analysis is formed by selecting the relevant data in the light of existing domain knowledge and data understanding.
* ''[[Data preparation]]:'' The data are preprocessed for removing noise and reducing complexity by eliminating attributes.
* ''[[Data mining]]:'' The data are analysed with the algorithm or heuristics developed to suit the data, model and goals.
* ''Interpretation:'' The mined patterns are evaluated on their relevance and validity by specialists and/or professionals in the application domain (e.g. excluding spurious correlations).
* ''Application:'' The constructed profiles are applied, e.g. to categories of persons, to test and fine-tune the algorithms.
* ''Institutional decision:'' The institution decides what actions or policies to apply to groups or individuals whose data match a relevant profile.

Data collection, preparation and mining all belong to the phase in which the profile is under construction. However, profiling also refers to the application of profiles, meaning the usage of profiles for the identification or categorization of groups or individual persons. As can be seen in step six (application), the process is circular. There is a feedback loop between the construction and the application of profiles. The interpretation of profiles can lead to the reiterant – possibly real-time – fine-tuning of specific previous steps in the profiling process. The application of profiles to people whose data were not used to construct the profile is based on data matching, which provides new data that allows for further adjustments. The process of profiling is both dynamic and adaptive. A good illustration of the dynamic and adaptive nature of profiling is the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining ([[CRISP-DM]]).

== Types of profiling practices ==

In order to clarify the nature of profiling technologies, some crucial distinctions have to be made between different types of profiling practices, apart from the distinction between the construction and the application of profiles. The main distinctions are those between bottom-up and top-down profiling (or supervised and unsupervised learning), and between individual and group profiles.

=== Supervised and unsupervised learning ===
Profiles can be classified according to the way they have been generated {{Harv|Fayyad|Piatetsky-Shapiro|Smyth|1996}} {{Harv|Zarsky|2002-3}}. On the one hand, profiles can be generated by testing a hypothesized correlation. This is called top-down profiling or [[supervised learning]]. This is similar to the methodology of traditional scientific research in that it starts with a hypothesis and consists of testing its validity. The result of this type of profiling is the verification or refutation of the hypothesis. One could also speak of deductive profiling. On the other hand, profiles can be generated by exploring a data base, using the [[data mining]] process to detect patterns in the data base that were not previously hypothesized. In a way, this is a matter of generating hypothesis: finding correlations one did not expect or even think of. Once the patterns have been mined, they will enter the loop – described above – and will be tested with the use of new data. This is called [[unsupervised learning]].

Two things are important with regard to this distinction. First, unsupervised learning algorithms seem to allow the construction of a new type of knowledge, not based on hypothesis developed by a researcher and not based on causal or motivational relations but exclusively based on stochastical correlations. Second, unsupervised learning algorithms thus seem to allow for an inductive type of knowledge construction that does not require theoretical justification or causal explanation {{Harv|Custers|2004}}.

Some authors claim that if the application of profiles based on computerized stochastical pattern recognition 'works', i.e. allows for reliable predictions of future behaviours, the theoretical or causal explanation of these patterns does not matter anymore {{Harv|Anderson|2008}}. However, the idea that 'blind' algorithms provide reliable information does not imply that the information is neutral. In the process of collecting and aggregating data into a database (the first three steps of the process of profile construction), translations are made from real-life events to [[machine-readable data]]. These data are then prepared and cleansed to allow for initial computability. Potential bias will have to be located at these points, as well as in the choice of algorithms that are developed. It is not possible to mine a database for all possible linear and non-linear correlations, meaning that the mathematical techniques developed to search for patterns will be determinate of the patterns that can be found. In the case of machine profiling, potential bias is not informed by common sense prejudice or what psychologists call stereotyping, but by the computer techniques employed in the initial steps of the process. These techniques are mostly invisible for those to whom profiles are applied (because their data match the relevant group profiles).

=== Individual and group profiles ===
Profiles must also be classified according to the kind of subject they refer to. This subject can either be an individual or a group of people. When a profile is constructed with the data of a single person, this is called individual profiling {{Harv|Jaquet-Chiffelle|2008}}. This kind of profiling is used to discover the particular characteristics of a certain individual, to enable unique identification or the provision of personalized services. However, personalized servicing is most often also based on group profiling, which allows categorisation of a person as a certain type of person, based on the fact that her profile matches with a profile that has been constructed on the basis of massive amounts of data about massive numbers of other people. A group profile can refer to the result of data mining in data sets that refer to an existing community that considers itself as such, like a religious group, a tennis club, a university, a political party etc. In that case it can describe previously unknown patterns of behaviour or other characteristics of such a group (community). A group profile can also refer to a category of people that do not form a community, but are found to share previously unknown patterns of behaviour or other characteristics {{Harv|Custers|2004}}. In that case the group profile describes specific behaviours or other characteristics of a category of people, like for instance women with blue eyes and red hair, or adults with relatively short arms and legs. These categories may be found to correlate with health risks, earning capacity, mortality rates, credit risks, etc.

If an individual profile is applied to the individual that it was mined from, then that is direct individual profiling. If a group profile is applied to an individual whose data match the profile, then that is indirect individual profiling, because the profile was generated using data of other people. Similarly, if a group profile is applied to the group that it was mined from, then that is direct group profiling {{Harv|Jaquet-Chiffelle|2008}}. However, in as far as the application of a group profile to a group implies the application of the group profile to individual members of the group, it makes sense to speak of indirect group profiling, especially if the group profile is non-distributive.

=== Distributive and non-distributive profiling ===
Group profiles can also be divided in terms of their distributive character {{Harv|Vedder|1999}}. A group profile is distributive when its properties apply equally to all the members of its group: all bachelors are unmarried, or all persons with a specific gene have 80% chance to contract a specific disease. A profile is non-distributive when the profile does not necessarily apply to all the members of the group: the group of persons with a specific postal code have an average earning capacity of XX, or the category of persons with blue eyes has an average chance of 37% to contract a specific disease. Note that in this case the chance of an individual to have a particular earning capacity or to contract the specific disease will depend on other factors, e.g. sex, age, background of parents, previous health, education. It should be obvious that, apart from tautological profiles like that of bachelors, most group profiles generated by means of computer techniques are non-distributive. This has far-reaching implications for the accuracy of indirect individual profiling based on data matching with non-distributive group profiles. Quite apart from the fact that the application of accurate profiles may be unfair or cause undue stigmatisation, most group profiles will not be accurate.

== Application domains ==

Profiling technologies can be applied in a variety of different domains and for a variety of purposes. These profiling practices will all have different effect and raise different issues.

Knowledge about the behaviour and preferences of customers is of great interest to the commercial sector. On the basis of profiling technologies, companies can predict the behaviour of different types of customers. Marketing strategies can then be tailored to the people fitting these types. Examples of profiling practices in marketing are customers [[loyalty cards]], [[customer relationship management]] in general, and personalized advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epic.org/privacy/profiling/|title=EPIC - Privacy and Consumer Profiling|author=Electronic Privacy Information Center|work=epic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.datenschutzzentrum.de/guetesiegel/register.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408071632/http://www.datenschutzzentrum.de/guetesiegel/register.htm |archivedate=2009-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.datenschutzzentrum.de/guetesiegel/kurzgutachten/g041006/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718191155/https://www.datenschutzzentrum.de/guetesiegel/kurzgutachten/g041006/ |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the financial sector, institutions use profiling technologies for [[fraud prevention]] and [[credit scoring]]. Banks want to minimise the risks in giving credit to their customers.  On the basis of extensive group profiling customers are assigned a certain scoring value that indicates their creditworthiness. Financial institutions like banks and insurance companies also use group profiling to detect fraud or [[money-laundering]]. Databases with transactions are searched with algorithms to find behaviours that deviate from the standard, indicating potentially suspicious transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Canhoto|first= A.I. |year=2007|title= Profiling behaviour: the social construction of categories in the detection of financial crime, dissertation at London School of Economics|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/informationSystems/pdf/theses/canhoto.pdf|format=PDF|work=lse.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of employment, profiles can be of use for tracking employees by monitoring their online behaviour, for the detection of fraud by them, and for the deployment of human resources by pooling and ranking their skills. {{Harv|Leopold|Meints|2008}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epic.org/privacy/workplace/|title=EPIC - Workplace Privacy|author=Electronic Privacy Information Center|work=epic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Profiling can also be used to support people at work, and also for learning, by intervening in the design of [[adaptive hypermedia]] systems personalising the interaction. For instance, this can be useful for supporting the [[attention management|management of attention]] {{Harv|Nabeth|2008}}.

In [[forensic science]], the possibility exists of linking different databases of cases and suspects and mining these for common patterns. This could be used for solving existing cases or for the purpose of establishing risk profiles of potential suspects {{Harv|Geradts|Sommer|2008}} {{Harv|Harcourt|2006}}.

== Risks and issues ==

Profiling technologies have raised a host of ethical, legal and other issues including [[privacy]], [[Equality before the law|equality]], [[due process]], [[security]] and [[Legal liability|liability]]. Numerous authors have warned against the affordances of a new technological infrastructure that could emerge on the basis of semi-autonomic profiling technologies {{Harv|Lessig|2006}} {{Harv|Solove|2004}} {{Harv|Schwartz|2000}}.

Privacy is one of the principal issues raised. Profiling technologies make possible a far-reaching monitoring of an individual's behaviour and preferences. Profiles may reveal personal or private information about individuals that they might not even be aware of themselves {{Harv|Hildebrandt|Gutwirth|2008}}.

Profiling technologies are by their very nature discriminatory tools. They allow unparalleled kinds of social sorting and segmentation which could have unfair effects. The people that are profiled may have to pay higher prices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Odlyzko|first= A.|year=2003|title= Privacy, economics, and price discrimination on the Internet, A. M. Odlyzko. ICEC2003: Fifth International Conference on Electronic Commerce, N. Sadeh, ed., ACM, pp. 355–366|url=http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/privacy.economics.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; they could miss out on important offers or opportunities, and they may run increased risks because catering to their needs is less profitable {{Harv|Lyon|2003}}. In most cases they will not be aware of this, since profiling practices are mostly invisible and the profiles themselves are often protected by intellectual property or trade secret. This poses a threat to the equality of and solidarity of citizens. On a larger scale, it might cause the segmentation of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gandy|first=O.|year=2002|title= Data Mining and Surveillance in the post 9/11 environment, Presentation at IAMCR, Barcelona|url=http://www.asc.upenn.edu/usr/ogandy/IAMCRdatamining.pdf|format=PDF|work=asc.upenn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the problems underlying potential violations of privacy and [[non-discrimination]] is that the process of profiling is more often than not invisible for those that are being profiled. This creates difficulties in that it becomes hard, if not impossible, to contest the application of a particular group profile. This disturbs principles of due process: if a person has no access to information on the basis of which they are withheld benefits or attributed certain risks, they cannot contest the way they are being treated {{Harv|Steinbock|2005}}.

Profiles can be used against people when they end up in the hands of people who are not entitled to access or use them. An important issue related to these breaches of security is [[identity theft]].

When the application of profiles causes harm, the liability for this harm has to be determined who is to be held accountable. Is the software programmer, the profiling service provider, or the profiled user to be held accountable? This issue of liability is especially complex in the case the application and decisions on profiles have also become automated like in [[Autonomic Computing]] or [[ambient intelligence]] decisions of automated decisions based on profiling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3582">'''Season cracking''' is a form of [[stress-corrosion cracking]] of [[brass]] [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge cases]] originally reported from British forces in India. During the [[monsoon]] season, military activity was temporarily reduced, and ammunition was stored in stables until the dry weather returned. Many brass cartridges were subsequently found to be cracked, especially where the case was crimped to the bullet. It was not until 1921 that the phenomenon was explained by Moor, Beckinsale and Mallinson: [[ammonia]] from horse urine, combined with the [[residual stress]] in the cold-drawn metal of the cartridges, was responsible for the cracking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Moore | first = H. | authorlink = |author2=Beckinsale, S. |author3=Mallinson, C.E.  | title = The Season Cracking of Brass and other Copper Alloys | journal = Journal of the Institute of Metals | volume = XXV | issue = | pages = 59–125 | publisher = | location = | year = 1921 | url = | issn = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:BrassSCC1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cracking in brass caused by ammonia attack]]
[[Image:35remsplitneck.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[.35 Remington]] cartridge that has experienced season cracking]]
Season cracking is characterised by deep brittle cracks which penetrate into affected components. If the cracks reach a critical size, the component can suddenly fracture, sometimes with disastrous results. However, if the concentration of ammonia is very high, then attack is much more severe, and attack over all exposed surfaces occurs. The problem was solved by [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] the brass cases after forming so as to relieve the residual stresses.
 
==Ammonia==
The attack takes the form of a reaction between [[ammonia]] and [[copper]] to form the [[cuprammonium]] ion, formula [Cu(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, a chemical complex which is water-soluble, and hence washed from the growing cracks. The problem of cracking can therefore also occur in [[copper]] and any other copper alloy, such as [[bronze]]. The tendency of copper to react with ammonia was exploited in making [[rayon]], and the deep blue colour of the aqueous solution of [[copper(II) oxide]] in ammonia is known as [[Schweizer's reagent]].{{huh|date=February 2012}}&lt;!-- the linked article says it uses copper hydroxide, not copper oxide--&gt;

==Materials==
Although the problem was first found in brass, any alloy containing [[copper]] will be susceptible to the problem. It includes copper itself (as used in pipe for example), [[bronze]]s and other alloys with a significant copper content.

Social cognitive neuroscience employs human [[neuroimaging]], typically using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]], [[electroencephalography]], and [[magnetoencephalography]].

Social cognition is primarily subserved by two dissociable [[Large_scale_brain_networks|macro-scale brain networks]]: the [[mirror neuron|mirror neuron system]] (MNS) and [[default mode network]] (DMN). MNS is thought to represent and identify observable actions (e.g. reaching for a cup) that are used by DMN to infer unobservable mental states, traits, and intentions (e.g. thirsty).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-11-01|title=Understanding intentions from actions: Direct perception, inference, and the roles of mirror and mentalizing systems|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|language=en|volume=36|pages=426–433|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2015.03.012|pmid=25864592|issn=1053-8100|last1=Catmur|first1=Caroline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Theoryofmind2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molnar-Szakacs|first=Istvan|last2=Uddin|first2=Lucina Q.|date=2013|title=Self-Processing and the Default Mode Network: Interactions with the Mirror Neuron System|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|language=English|volume=7|pages=571|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00571|pmid=24062671|pmc=3769892|issn=1662-5161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concordantly, the activation onset of MNS precedes DMN during social cognition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, the extent of [[feedforward]], [[feedback]], and [[Recurrence|recurrent]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} processing within and between MNS and DMN is not yet well-characterized, thus it is difficult to fully dissociate the exact functions of the two networks and their nodes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

=== Mirror Neuron System (MNS) ===

[[Mirror neuron]]s, first discovered in [[macaque]] frontoparietal cortex, fire when actions are either performed or observed.&lt;ref name=Rizzolatti2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rizzolatti |first1=G |last2=Craighero |first2=L |title=The mirror-neuron system. |journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience |date=2004 |volume=27 |pages=169–92 |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144230 |pmid=15217330}} {{update-inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, similar sensorimotor "mirroring" responses have been found in the brain regions listed below, which are collectively referred to as MNS.&lt;ref name=Rizzolatti2004/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2008" /&gt; The MNS is has been found to identify and represent intentional actions such as [[Facial expression|facial expressions]], [[body language]], and [[Grasp|grasping]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rizzolatti|first1=G|last2=Fabbri-Destro|first2=M|date=April 2008|title=The mirror system and its role in social cognition.|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|volume=18|issue=2|pages=179–84|doi=10.1016/j.conb.2008.08.001|pmid=18706501}} {{update-inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; MNS may encode the ''concept'' of an action, not just the sensory and motor information associated with an action.

Mechanistic theories of MNS functioning fall broadly into two camps: motor and cognitive theories. Classical motor theories claim that abstract action representations arise from simulating actions within the motor system, while newer cognitive theories propose that abstract action representations arise from the integration of multiple domains of information: [[Perception|perceptual]], [[Motor system|motor]], [[Semantics|semantic]], and [[conceptual]].&lt;ref name="Lingnau2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lingnau|first1=A|last2=Downing|first2=PE|date=May 2015|title=The lateral occipitotemporal cortex in action.|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=19|issue=5|pages=268–77|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2015.03.006|pmid=25843544}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Aside from these competing theories, there are more fundamental controversies surrounding the human MNS – even the very existence of mirror neurons in this network is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caramazza|first=Alfonso|last2=Anzellotti|first2=Stefano|last3=Strnad|first3=Lukas|last4=Lingnau|first4=Angelika|date=2014-07-08|title=Embodied Cognition and Mirror Neurons: A Critical Assessment|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=1–15|doi=10.1146/annurev-neuro-071013-013950|pmid=25032490|issn=0147-006X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickok2009" /&gt; As such, the term "MNS" is sometimes eschewed for more functionally-defined names such as "action observation network", "action identification network", and "action representation network".&lt;ref name="Hickok2009"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hickok|first=Gregory|date=July 2009|title=Eight Problems for the Mirror Neuron Theory of Action Understanding in Monkeys and Humans|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|language=EN|volume=21|issue=7|pages=1229–1243|doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21189|pmc=2773693|pmid=19199415}} {{update-inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Premotor Cortex ====

The [[macaque]] [[premotor cortex]] was the location of the first discoveries of mirror neurons.&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2004" /&gt; The premotor cortex is associated with a diverse array of functions, encompassing low-level motor control, motor planning, sensory guidance of movement, along with higher level cognitive functions such as [[Language processing in the brain|language processing]] and action comprehension.&lt;ref name="Graziano2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graziano|first1=MS|last2=Aflalo|first2=TN|date=25 October 2007|title=Mapping behavioral repertoire onto the cortex.|journal=Neuron|volume=56|issue=2|pages=239–51|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2007.09.013|pmid=17964243}} {{open access}} {{update-inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premotor cortex has been found to contain subregions with unique [[Cytoarchitecture|cytoarchitectural]] properties, the significance of which is not yet fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Graziano|first1=Michael S.A.|date=2016-02-01|title=Ethological Action Maps: A Paradigm Shift for the Motor Cortex|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=121–132|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2015.10.008|issn=1364-6613|pmid=26628112}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, sensorimotor mirroring responses are also found throughout premotor cortex and adjacent sections of [[inferior frontal gyrus]] and [[supplementary motor area]]&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2008" /&gt;

Visuospatial information is more prevalent in ventral premotor cortex than dorsal premotor cortex.&lt;ref name="Graziano2007" /&gt; In humans, sensorimotor mirroring responses extend beyond ventral premotor cortex into adjacent regions of inferior frontal gyrus, including [[Broca's area]], an area that is critical to language processing and speech production.&lt;ref name="Nishitani2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nishitani|first1=N|last2=Schürmann|first2=M|last3=Amunts|first3=K|last4=Hari|first4=R|date=February 2005|title=Broca's region: from action to language.|journal=Physiology (Bethesda, Md.)|volume=20|pages=60–9|doi=10.1152/physiol.00043.2004|pmid=15653841}} {{open access}} {{update-inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Action representations in inferior frontal gyrus can be evoked by language, such as action verbs, in addition to observed and performed action stimuli typically used in biological motion studies&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. The overlap between language and action understanding processes in inferior frontal gyrus has spurred some researchers to suggest overlapping neurocomputational mechanisms between the two.&lt;ref name="Nishitani2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Dorsal premotor cortex is strongly associated with motor preparation and guidance, such as representing multiple motor choices and deciding the final selection of action.&lt;ref name="Graziano2007" /&gt;

==== Intraparietal Sulcus ====
Classical studies of action observation have found mirror neurons in macaque [[intraparietal sulcus]].&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2004" /&gt; In humans, sensorimotor mirroring responses are centered around the anterior intraperietal sulcus, with responses also seen in adjacent regions such as [[inferior parietal lobule]] and [[superior parietal lobule]]. Intraparietal sulcus appears to be most sensitive to the motor features (relative to perceptual and semantic features) of biological motion.&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2008" /&gt; Intraparietal sulcus is considered a part of the [[two streams hypothesis|dorsal visual stream]], but is also thought to receive inputs from upstream non-dorsal stream areas such as LOTC and posterior superior temporal sulcus.&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2008" /&gt;

==== Lateral Occipitotemporal Cortex (LOTC) ====
LOTC encompasses lateral regions of the [[visual cortex]] such as area [[Visual cortex#Middle temporal visual area (V5)|V5]]. Though LOTC is typically associated with visual processing, sensorimotor mirroring responses and abstract action representations are reliably found in this region.&lt;ref name="Lingnau2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Downing2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Downing|first1=PE|last2=Peelen|first2=MV|date=2011|title=The role of occipitotemporal body-selective regions in person perception.|journal=Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=2|issue=3–4|pages=186–203|doi=10.1080/17588928.2011.582945|pmid=24168534}}&lt;/ref&gt; LOTC includes cortical areas that are sensitive to motion, objects, body parts, kinematics, body postures, observed movements, and semantic content in verbs.&lt;ref name=Lingnau2015/&gt;&lt;ref name="Downing2011" /&gt; LOTC is thought to encode the fine sensorimotor details of an observed action (e.g. local kinematic and perceptual features).&lt;ref name=Downing2011/&gt; LOTC is also thought to bind together the different means by which a specific action can be carried out.&lt;ref name=Lingnau2015/&gt;

=== Default Mode Network (DMN) ===
{{See also|Theory_of_mind#Brain_mechanisms|}} The [[default mode network]] (DMN) is thought to process and represent abstract social information, such as mental states, traits, and intentions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amft|first=Maren|last2=Bzdok|first2=Danilo|last3=Laird|first3=Angela R.|last4=Fox|first4=Peter T.|last5=Schilbach|first5=Leonhard|last6=Eickhoff|first6=Simon B.|date=2014-01-08|title=Definition and characterization of an extended social-affective default network|journal=Brain Structure and Function|language=en|volume=220|issue=2|pages=1031–1049|doi=10.1007/s00429-013-0698-0|issn=1863-2653|pmc=4087104|pmid=24399179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2009-11-15|title=Understanding others' actions and goals by mirror and mentalizing systems: A meta-analysis|journal=NeuroImage|language=en|volume=48|issue=3|pages=564–584|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.06.009|pmid=19524046|issn=1053-8119|last1=Van Overwalle|first1=Frank|last2=Baetens|first2=Kris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social cognitive functions such as [[theory of mind]], [[Mentalization|mentalizing]], [[emotion]] recognition, [[empathy]], [[Morality|moral]] cognition, and social [[working memory]] consistently recruit DMN regions in human neuroimaging studies.

==== Medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC) ====
{{See also|Dorsomedial prefrontal cortex|Ventromedial prefrontal cortex|Orbitofrontal cortex|}}
[[Medial prefrontal cortex]] (mPFC) is strongly associated with abstract social cognition such as mentalizing and theory of mind.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denny|first=Bryan T.|last2=Kober|first2=Hedy|last3=Wager|first3=Tor D.|last4=Ochsner|first4=Kevin N.|date=August 2012|title=A Meta-analysis of Functional Neuroimaging Studies of Self- and Other Judgments Reveals a Spatial Gradient for Mentalizing in Medial Prefrontal Cortex|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|language=en|volume=24|issue=8|pages=1742–1752|doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00233|issn=0898-929X|pmc=3806720|pmid=22452556}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Theoryofmind2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Mentalizing about others activates much of the mPFC, but dorsal mPFC appears to be more selective for information about other people, while the middle mPFC may be more selective for information about the self.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

Ventral regions of mPFC, such as ventromedial prefrontal cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex, are thought to play a critical role in the affective components of social cognition. For example, ventromedial prefrontal cortex has been found to represent [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] information about other people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Ventral mPFC has been shown to be critical in the computation and representation of [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] and value for many types of stimuli, not just social stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-02-01|title=Emotional processing in anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|language=en|volume=15|issue=2|pages=85–93|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.11.004|pmid=21167765|pmc=3035157|issn=1364-6613|last1=Etkin|first1=Amit|last2=Egner|first2=Tobias|last3=Kalisch|first3=Raffael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[temporoparietal junction]] (TPJ) is thought to be critical to distinguishing between multiple agents, such as the self and other.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The right TPJ is robustly activated by false belief tasks, in which subjects have to distinguish between others' beliefs and their own beliefs in a given situation.&lt;ref name="Theoryofmind2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The TPJ is also recruited by the wide variety of abstract social cognitive tasks associated with the DMN.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Outside of the social domain, TPJ is associated with a diverse array of functions such as attentional reorienting, target detection, contextual updating, language processing, and episodic memory retrieval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krall|first=S.

'''''The Myth of Sisyphus''''' ({{lang-fr|Le Mythe de Sisyphe}}) is a 1942 philosophical essay by [[Albert Camus]]. The English translation by Justin O'Brien was first published in 1955.

In the essay Camus introduces his philosophy of the [[absurdism|absurd]], man's futile search for meaning, unity, and clarity in the face of an unintelligible world devoid of God and eternal truths or values. Does the realization of the absurd require suicide? Camus answers, "No. It requires revolt." He then outlines several approaches to the absurd life. The final chapter compares the absurdity of man's life with the situation of [[Sisyphus]], a figure of [[Greek mythology]] who was condemned to repeat forever the same meaningless task of pushing a boulder up a mountain, only to see it roll down again. The essay concludes, "The struggle itself ... is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy".

The work can be seen in relation to other absurdist works by Camus: the novel ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' (1942), the plays  ''[[The Misunderstanding]]'' (1942) and ''[[Caligula (play)|Caligula]]'' (1944), and especially the essay ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]'' (1951).

==Summary==
The essay is dedicated to [[Pascal Pia]] and is organized in four chapters and one appendix.

===Chapter 1: An Absurd Reasoning===
Camus undertakes the task of answering what he considers to be the only question of [[philosophy]] that matters: Does the realization of the meaninglessness and absurdity of life necessarily require suicide?

He begins by describing the absurd condition: we build our life on the hope for tomorrow, yet tomorrow brings us closer to death and is the ultimate enemy; people live their lives as if they weren't aware of the certainty of death. Once stripped of its common romanticism, the world is a foreign, strange and inhuman place; true knowledge is impossible and rationality and science cannot explain the world: their stories ultimately end in meaningless abstractions, in metaphors. This is the absurd condition and "from the moment absurdity is recognized, it becomes a passion, the most harrowing of all."

It is not the world that is absurd, nor human thought: the absurd arises when the human need to understand meets the unreasonableness of the world, when "my appetite for the absolute and for unity" meets "the impossibility of reducing this world to a rational and reasonable principle."

He then characterizes a number of philosophies that describe and attempt to deal with this feeling of the absurd, by [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], [[Karl Jaspers|Jaspers]], [[Lev Shestov|Shestov]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], and [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]]. All of these, he claims, commit "philosophical suicide" by reaching conclusions that contradict the original absurd position, either by abandoning reason and turning to God, as in the case of Kierkegaard and Shestov, or by elevating reason and ultimately arriving at ubiquitous [[Theory of forms|Platonic forms]] and an abstract god, as in the case of Husserl.

For Camus, who set out to take the absurd seriously and follow it to its final conclusions, these "leaps" cannot convince. Taking the absurd seriously means acknowledging the contradiction between the desire of human reason and the unreasonable world. Suicide, then, also must be rejected: without man, the absurd cannot exist. The contradiction must be lived; reason and its limits must be acknowledged, without false hope. However, the absurd can never be accepted: it requires constant confrontation, constant revolt.

While the question of human [[free will|freedom in the metaphysical sense]] loses interest to the absurd man, he gains freedom in a very concrete sense: no longer bound by hope for a better future or eternity, without a need to pursue life's purpose or to create meaning, "he enjoys a freedom with regard to common rules".

To embrace the absurd implies embracing all that the unreasonable world has to offer. Without a meaning in life, there is no scale of values. "What counts is not the best living but the most living."

Thus, Camus arrives at three consequences from fully acknowledging the absurd: revolt, freedom, and passion.

===Chapter 2: The Absurd Man===
How should the absurd man live? Clearly, no ethical rules apply, as they are all based on higher powers or on justification. "Integrity has no need of rules." 'Everything is permitted' "is not an outburst of relief or of joy, but rather a bitter acknowledgment of a fact."

Camus then goes on to present examples of the absurd life. He begins with [[Don Juan]], the serial seducer who lives the passionate life to the fullest. "There is no noble love but that which recognizes itself to be both short-lived and exceptional."

The next example is the [[actor]], who depicts ephemeral lives for ephemeral fame. "He demonstrates to what degree appearing creates being." "In those three hours he travels the whole course of the dead-end path that the man in the audience takes a lifetime to cover."

Camus's third example of the absurd man is the conqueror, the warrior who forgoes all promises of eternity to affect and engage fully in human history. He chooses action over contemplation, aware of the fact that nothing can last and no victory is final.

===Chapter 3: Absurd Creation===
Here Camus explores the absurd creator or artist.  Since explanation is impossible, absurd art is restricted to a description of the myriad experiences in the world. "If the world were clear, art would not exist." Absurd creation, of course, also must refrain from judging and from alluding to even the slightest shadow of hope.

He then analyzes the work of [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]] in this light, especially ''[[The Diary of a Writer]]'',  ''[[The Possessed (novel)|The Possessed]]'' and ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]''. All these works start from the absurd position, and the first two explore the theme of philosophical suicide. However, both ''The Diary'' and his last novel, ''The Brothers Karamazov'', ultimately find a path to hope and faith and thus fail as truly absurd creations.

===Chapter 4: The Myth of Sisyphus===
In the last chapter, Camus outlines the legend of Sisyphus who defied the gods and put Death in chains so that no human needed to die. When Death was eventually liberated and it came time for Sisyphus himself to die, he concocted a deceit which let him escape from the underworld. After finally capturing Sisyphus, the gods decided that his punishment would last for all eternity. He would have to push a rock up a mountain; upon reaching the top, the rock would roll down again, leaving Sisyphus to start over. Camus sees Sisyphus as the absurd hero who lives life to the fullest, hates death, and is condemned to a meaningless task.

Camus presents Sisyphus's ceaseless and pointless toil as a metaphor for modern lives spent working at futile jobs in factories and offices. "The workman of today works every day in his life at the same tasks, and this fate is no less absurd. But it is tragic only at the rare moments when it becomes conscious."

Camus is interested in Sisyphus' thoughts when marching down the mountain, to start anew. After the stone falls back down the mountain Camus states that "It is during that return, that pause, that Sisyphus interests me. A face that toils so close to stones is already stone itself! I see that man going back down with a heavy yet measured step toward the torment of which he will never know the end." This is the truly tragic moment, when the hero becomes conscious of his wretched condition. He does not have hope, but "there is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn." Acknowledging the truth will conquer it; Sisyphus, just like the absurd man, keeps pushing. Camus claims that when Sisyphus acknowledges the futility of his task and the certainty of his fate, he is freed to realize the absurdity of his situation and to reach a state of contented acceptance.  With a nod to the similarly cursed Greek hero [[Oedipus]], Camus concludes that "all is well," indeed, that "one must imagine Sisyphus happy."

===Appendix===
The essay contains an appendix titled "Hope and the Absurd in the work of [[Franz Kafka]]". While Camus acknowledges that Kafka's work represents an exquisite description of the absurd condition, he maintains that Kafka fails as an absurd writer because his work retains a glimmer of hope.

'''''The Power Elite''''' is a 1956 book by [[sociologist]] [[C. Wright Mills]], in which Mills calls attention to the interwoven interests of the leaders of the [[military]], [[corporate]], and [[political]] elements of [[society]] and suggests that the ordinary [[citizen]] is a relatively powerless subject of manipulation by those entities.

==Background==
The book is something of a counterpart of Mills' 1951 work, ''[[White Collar: The American Middle Classes]]'', which examines the then-growing role of [[Middle management|middle managers]] in American society. A main inspiration for the book was [[Franz Leopold Neumann]]'s book ''[[Behemoth: The Structure and Practice of National Socialism]]'' in 1942, a study of how Nazism came into a position of power in a democratic state like Germany. ''Behemoth'' had a major impact on Mills and he claimed that Behemoth had given him the "tools to grasp and analyse the entire total structure and as a warning of what could happen in a modern capitalist democracy".&lt;ref&gt;C.Wright Mills: ''Power, Politics and People'', (New York, 1963 p.174)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Joint Chiefs of Staff 1949.jpg|thumb|275px|left|The [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], pictured here in 1949, are four of six ruling elites Mills identified.]]
According to Mills, the eponymous "power elite" are those that occupy the dominant positions, in the dominant institutions (military, economic and political) of a dominant country, and their decisions (or lack of decisions) have enormous consequences, not only for the U.S. population but, "the underlying populations of the world." The institutions which they head, Mills posits, are a triumvirate of groups that have succeeded weaker predecessors: (1) "two or three hundred giant corporations" which have replaced the traditional agrarian and craft economy, (2) a strong federal political order that has inherited power from "a decentralized set of several dozen states" and "now enters into each and every cranny of the social structure," and (3) the military establishment, formerly an object of "distrust fed by state militia," but now an entity with "all the grim and clumsy efficiency of a sprawling bureaucratic domain."

Importantly, and in distinction from modern American [[conspiracy theory]], Mills explains that the elite themselves may not be aware of their status as an elite, noting that "often they are uncertain about their roles" and "without conscious effort, they absorb the aspiration to be ... The Ones Who Decide." Nonetheless, he sees them as a quasi-hereditary caste. The members of the power elite, according to Mills, often enter into positions of societal prominence through educations obtained at [[east coast of the United States|eastern]] establishment universities like [[Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and [[Yale]]. But, Mills notes, "Harvard or Yale or Princeton is not enough ... the point is not Harvard, but which Harvard?" Mills identifies two classes of [[Ivy League]] alumni, those initiated into an upper echelon [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternity]] or [[final club]], such as [[Porcellian]] and [[Fly Club]], and those who are not. Those so initiated, Mills continues, receive their invitations based on social links first established in elite private [[University-preparatory school#United States|preparatory academies]], where they are enrolled as part of antebellum family traditions. In this manner, the mantle of the elite generally passes through families. 
[[File:Joseph and Rose Kennedy 1940.JPG|thumb|275px|right|Historically prominent families, such as the Kennedy family, form the "Metropolitan 400." Shown here are Rose and Joseph Kennedy in 1940.]]
The resulting elites, who control the three dominant institutions (military, economy and political system) can be generally grouped into one of six types, according to Mills: 
* the "Metropolitan 400" - members of historically notable local families in the principal American cities, generally represented on the [[Social Register]]
* "Celebrities" - prominent entertainers and media personalities
* the "Chief Executives" - presidents and CEOs of the most important companies within each industrial sector
* the "Corporate Rich" - major landowners and corporate shareholders
* the "Warlords" - senior military officers, most importantly the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]
* the "Political Directorate" - "fifty-odd men of the executive branch" of the U.S. federal government, including the senior leadership in the [[Executive Office of the President]], sometimes variously drawn from elected officials of the [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party of the United States|Republican]] parties but usually professional government [[bureaucrat]]s

Mills formulated a very short summary of his book: "Who, after all, runs America? No one runs it altogether, but in so far as any group does, the power elite."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sociological Imagination|last=Mills|first=C. Wright|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and criticism==
Commenting on ''The Power Elite'', [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]] derisively said, "I look forward to the time when Mr. Mills hands back his prophet's robes and settles down to being a sociologist again."&lt;ref name="NYTMAY"&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Summers |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Deciders |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/books/review/14summers.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |work=New York Times |publisher= |date=14 May 2006 |accessdate=14 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Berle]] noted the book contained "an uncomfortable degree of truth", but Mills presented "an angry cartoon, not a serious picture".&lt;ref name="NYTMAY" /&gt;  [[Dennis Wrong]] described ''The Power Elite'' as "an uneven blend of journalism, sociology, and moral indignation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dennis |last=Wrong |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Power Elite, by C. Wright Mills |url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/the-power-elite-by-c-wright-mills/ |work=Commentary Magazine |publisher= |date=September 1956 |accessdate=14 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of the book in the ''Louisiana Law Review'' bemoaned that the "practical danger of Mr. Mills' pessimistic interpretation of the current situation is that his readers will concentrate on answering his prejudicial assertions rather than ponder the results of his really formidable research".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Calvin |last=Woodard |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=THE POWER ELITE, by C. Wright Mills |url=http://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2448&amp;context=lalrev |work=Louisiana Law Review |publisher= |date=December 1956 |accessdate=14 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, consideration of the book has become moderately more favorable over time. In 2006, [[G. William Domhoff]] wrote, "Mills looks even better than he did 50 years ago".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=G. William|last=Domhoff|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Mills's The Power Elite, 50 Years Later |work=Contemporary Sociology |publisher= |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mills' biographer, John Summers, admitted that ''The Power Elite'' was "vulnerable to the charge of conspiracy-mongering" but declared that its historical value "seems assured".&lt;ref name="NYTMAY"/&gt; In a purposeful extension of Mills' Power Elite, his proposed International System, and Comparative Sociology, Muhammed Asadi (2012) suggests that the modern World System is highly militarized and a counterpart of the US permanent war economy where a global division of labor based on military Keynesian stabilization exists concomitant with economic accumulation. He calls these countries, militarized states, whose economic growth stabilizes the World System run by the Command States (counterpart to Wallerstein's Core but includes military and political domination in addition to financial and trade domination) just like military spending in the US stabilizes the US economy. Militarization and wars are therefore encouraged by the Command States and facilitated by them just as suggested by Mills in The Causes of World War Three (1958), the preparation for war leads to wars.&lt;ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

Episode 5 of the [[Netflix]] [[TV series]] ''[[Mindhunter (TV series)|Mindhunter]]'' contains a scene in which one of the main characters, a sociology PhD student Deborah "Debbie" Mitford, writes a paper on [[C. Wright Mills]]'s ''The Power Elite''.

The '''Trikāya doctrine''' ([[Sanskrit]], literally "three bodies"; {{cjkv|c=三身|p=sānshēn|rr=samsin|v=tam thân|r=sanjin, sanshin}}, {{bo|t=སྐུ་གསུམ|w=sku gsum}}) is a [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhist]] teaching on both the nature of reality and the nature of [[Buddhahood]].

==Definition==
The doctrine says that a Buddha has three ''kāyas'' or ''bodies'':
# The ''[[Dharmakāya]]'', ''Buddha nature'', ''law and order'', or ''Truth body'' which embodies the very principle of enlightenment and knows no limits or boundaries;
# The ''[[Saṃbhogakāya]]'', ''Buddha fields'' or ''body of mutual enjoyment'' which is a body of bliss or clear light manifestation;
# The ''[[Nirmāṇakāya]]'', ''Buddha incarnation'', ''Emanation'', or ''created body'' which manifests in time and space.&lt;ref name="Welwood, John 2007"&gt;Welwood, John (2000).

==Origins==

===Pāli Canon===
Even before the Buddha's [[Parinirvana|parinirvāṇa]], the term ''Dhammakāya'' was current. Dhammakāya literally means ''Truth body''.

In the [[Pāli Canon]], [[Gautama Buddha]] tells [[Vasistha|Vasettha]] that the [[Tathāgata]] (the Buddha) is the Dhammakāya, the 'Truth-body' or the 'Embodiment of Truth', as well as ''Dhammabhūta'', 'Truth-become', 'One who has become Truth' &lt;ref&gt;[[Dīgha Nikāya 27.9]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Walsh, Maurice. 1995. The Long Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Dīgha Nikāya. Boston: Wisdom Publications, “Aggañña Sutta: On Knowledge of Beginnings,” p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha is equated with the Dhamma: "[T]he Buddha comforts him, 'Enough, Vakkali. Why do you want to see this filthy body? Whoever sees the Dhamma sees me; whoever sees me sees the Dhamma.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.5-6.than.html http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.5-6.than.html] [[Samyutta Nikaya]] (SN 22.87) See footnote #3&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Aggañña Sutta]]'', the Buddha advises Vasettha that whoever has strong, deep rooted, and established belief in the Tathagatha, he can declare that he is the child of [[Bhagavan]], born from the mouth of Dhamma, created from Dhamma, and the heir of Dhamma. Because the titles of the Tathagatha are: The Body of Dhamma, The Body of [[Brahmā (Buddhism)|Brahma]], the Manifestation of Dhamma, and the Manifestation of Brahma.

===Mahāyāna===
The Dharmakāya doctrine was possibly first expounded in the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā]]'' "The Perfection of Wisdom In Eight Thousand Verses", composed in the 1st century BCE.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] introduced the [[Sambhogakāya]], which conceptually fits between the Nirmāṇakāya (the manifestations of enlightenment in the physical world){{refn|group=note|Formerly called [[Rūpa|Rupakaya]]}} and the Dharmakaya. The Sambhogakaya is that aspect of the Buddha, or the Dharma, that one meets in visions and in deep meditation. It could be considered an interface with the Dharmakaya.

The Trikaya-doctrine and the [[Buddha-nature]] bring the transcendental within reach, by placing the transcendental within the [[plane of immanence]].

Around 300 CE, the Yogacara school systematized the prevalent ideas on the nature of the Buddha in the Trikaya or ''three-body doctrine''.{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=126}}

==Interpretation in Buddhist traditions==
Schools have different ideas about what the three bodies are.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huayen.org.tw/thesis/10/1010.pdf 佛三身觀之研究－以漢譯經論為主要研究對象] {{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://enlight.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-MAG/mag89471.html 佛陀的三身觀]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese Mahayana===

====Pure Land====
The Three Bodies of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] from the point of view of [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land Buddhist]] thought can be broken down like so:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hattori | first = Sho-on | title = A Raft from the Other Shore : Honen and the Way of Pure Land Buddhism | publisher = Jodo Shu Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 4-88363-329-2 | pages=25–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Nirmaṇakāya is a physical/manifest body of a Buddha. An example would be [[Gautama Buddha]]'s body.
* The [[Sambhogakāya]] is the reward/enjoyment body, whereby a [[bodhisattva]] completes his vows and becomes a Buddha. [[Amitābha]], Vajrasattva and Manjushri are examples of Buddhas with the Sambhogakaya body.
* The [[Dharmakāya]] is the embodiment of the truth itself, and it is commonly seen as transcending the forms of physical and spiritual bodies.  [[Vairocana]] Buddha is often depicted as the Dharmakāya, particularly in esoteric Buddhist schools such as [[Shingon Buddhism]], [[Tendai]] and [[Kegon]] in Japan.

As with earlier Buddhist thought, all three forms of the Buddha teach the same [[Dharma]], but take on different forms to expound the truth.

====Chan Buddhism====
According to Schloegl, in the ''[[Linji school#Zhenzhou Linji Huizhao Chansi yulu .281120.29|Zhenzhou Linji Huizhao Chansi Yulu]]'', the Three Bodies of the Buddha are not taken as absolute. They would be "mental configurations" that "are merely names or props" and would only perform a role of light and shadow of the mind.{{sfn|Schloegl|1976|p=19}}{{refn|group=note|Lin-ji yu-lu: "The scholars of the Sutras and Treatises take the Three Bodies as absolute. As I see it, this is not so. These Three Bodies are merely names, or props. An old master said: "The (Buddha's) Bodies are set up with reference to meaning; the (Buddha) Fields are distinguished with reference to substance." However, understood clearly, the Dharma Nature Bodies and the Dharma Nature Fields are only mental configurations."{{sfn|Schloegl|1976|p=21}}}}

The ''Zhenzhou Linji Huizhao Chansi Yulu'' advises:
{{quote|Do you wish to be not different from the Buddhas and patriarchs? Then just do not look for anything outside. The pure light of your own heart [i.e., 心, mind] at this instant is the Dharmakaya Buddha in your own house. The non-differentiating light of your heart at this instant is the Sambhogakaya Buddha in your own house. The non-discriminating light of your own heart at this instant is the Nirmanakaya Buddha in your own house.  This trinity of the Buddha's body is none other than he here before your eyes, listening to my expounding the Dharma.{{sfn|Schloegl|1976|p=18}}}}

===[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] Buddhism===

====Fourth and Fifth Bodies - Svābhāvikakāya and Mahasukhakaya====
{{See also|Kosha}}

[[Vajrayana]] sometimes refers to a fourth body called the ''svābhāvikakāya'' ({{bo|t=ངོ་བོ་ཉིད་ཀྱི་སྐུ|w=ngo bo nyid kyi sku}}) "essential body",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khandro.net/doctrine_trikaya.htm remarks on Svabhavikakaya by khandro.net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the book ''Embodiment of Buddhahood'' Chapter 4 the subject is: Embodiment of Buddhahood in its Own Realization: [[Yogacara]] Svabhavikakaya as Projection of Praxis and Gnoseology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jigtenmig.blogspot.com/2007/10/ngo-bo-nyid-kyi-sku-svabhahavikakaya.html explanation of meaning]&lt;/ref&gt; and to a fifth body, called the mahāsūkhakāya ({{bo|w=bde ba chen po'i sku}}, "great bliss body").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tsangnyön Heruka|authorlink1=Tsangnyön Heruka|title=The life of Marpa the translator : seeing accomplishes all|date=1995|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston|isbn=978-1570620874|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; The svābhāvikakāya is simply the unity or non-separateness of the three kayas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khandro.net/doctrine_trikaya.htm khandro.net citing H.E. Tai Situpa]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also known in [[Gelug]] teachings, where it is one of the assumed two aspects of the dharmakāya: ''svābhāvikakāya'' "essence body" and jñānakāya "body of wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Paul|title=Mahayana Buddhism: the doctrinal foundations|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-02537-9|edition=Reprinted|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3FuzkBnOxAC&amp;pg=PR10&amp;dq=Mah%C4%81y%C4%81na+Buddhism&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=imY1Ve7oLYSksAXX4oDgCg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=j%C3%B1anakaya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Haribhadra (Buddhist philosopher)|Haribhadra]] claims that the ''[[Abhisamayalankara]]'' describes [[Buddhahood]] through four kāyas in chapter 8: svābhāvikakāya, [jñāna]dharmakāya, sambhogakāya and nirmāṇakāya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Makransky|first1=John J.|title=Buddhahood embodied : sources of controversy in India and Tibet|date=1997|publisher=State Univ. of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=978-0791434314|page=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4qmkptncxQC&amp;q=embodiment+of+kaya#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dzogchen====
In [[dzogchen]] teachings, "dharmakaya" means the buddha-nature's absence of self-nature, that is, its emptiness of a conceptualizable essence, its cognizance or clarity is the sambhogakaya, and the fact that its capacity is 'suffused with self-existing awareness' is the nirmanakaya.&lt;ref&gt;[[Reginald Ray]], ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, page 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mahamudra====
The interpretation in [[Mahamudra]] is similar: When the mahamudra practices come to fruition, one sees that the mind and all phenomena are fundamentally empty of any identity; this emptiness is called ''dharmakāya''. One perceives that the essence of mind is empty, but that it also has a potentiality that takes the form of luminosity.{{clarify|date=November 2013}} In Mahamudra thought, Sambhogakāya is understood to be this luminosity. Nirmanakāya is understood to be the powerful force with which the potentiality affects living beings.&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, pages 284-285.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anuyoga====
In the view of [[Anuyoga]], the [[Mind Stream]] (Sanskrit: ''citta santana'') is the 'continuity' (Sanskrit: ''santana''; Wylie: ''rgyud'') that links the Trikaya.&lt;ref name="Welwood, John 2007"/&gt; The Trikāya, as a triune, is symbolised by the [[Gankyil]].

====Dakinis====
A [[dakini|ḍākinī]] ({{bo|t=མཁའ་འགྲོ་[མ་]|w=mkha' 'gro [ma]}} ''khandro[ma]'') is a [[Tantra|tantric]] [[deity]] described as a female embodiment of enlightened energy. The Sanskrit term is likely related to the term for drumming, while the Tibetan term means "sky goer" and may have originated in the Sanskrit ''khecara'', a term from the ''[[Cakrasaṃvara Tantra]]''.&lt;ref name=Buswell&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert Jr|editor2-last=Lopez|editor2-first=Donald S. Jr.|editor1-link=Robert Buswell Jr.|editor2-link=Donald S. Lopez, Jr.|title=Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism.|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691157863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ḍākinīs can also be classified according to the trikāya theory. The dharmakāya ḍākinī, which is [[Samantabhadrī (tutelary)|Samantabhadrī]], represents the [[dharmadhatu]] where all phenomena appear. The sambhogakāya ḍākinī are the [[yidam]]s used as meditational deities for tantric practice. The nirmanakaya ḍākinīs are human women born with special potentialities; these are realized [[yogini]], the consorts of the [[guru]]s, or even all women in general as they may be classified into the families of the [[Five Tathagatas]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Capriles, Elías (2003/2007). ''Buddhism and Dzogchen'' [http://webdelprofesor.ula.ve/humanidades/elicap/en/uploads/Biblioteca/bdz-e.version.pdf]', and Capriles, Elías (2006/2007). ''Beyond Being, Beyond Mind, Beyond History,'' vol. I, ''Beyond Being''[http://webdelprofesor.ula.ve/humanidades/elicap/en/Main/Bb-bm-bh]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-Buddhist Interpretations===

====Theosophy====
[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], a Western esoteric school founded in the 19th century, regards Buddhism as containing esoteric teachings. In those supposed esoteric teachings of Buddhism, "exoteric Buddhism" believes that Nirmanakaya simple means the physical body of Buddha. According to the esoteric interpretation, when the Buddha dies he assumes the Nirmanakaya, instead of going into [[Nirvana]]. He remains in that glorious body he has woven for himself, invisible to uninitiated mankind, to watch over and protect it.&lt;ref&gt;Helena Blavatsky, ''The Voice of the Silence'' Theosophical Publishing Co., pages 75-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

A literary '''trope''' is the use of [[figurative language]], via word, phrase or an image, for artistic effect such as using a [[figure of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|year=1990|title=Tropes, Parables, and Performatives|publisher=Duke University Press|page=9|isbn= 0822311119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''trope'' has also come to be used for describing commonly recurring [[Literary technique|literary]] and [[rhetorical device]]s,&lt;ref name=cuddon&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuddon|first=J. A.|first2=C. E.|last2=Preston|title=The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory|edition=4|year=1998|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=9780140513639|page=948|chapter=Trope}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[motif (narrative)|motifs]] or [[cliché]]s in creative works.&lt;ref name="trope_mw" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|chapter=trope (revised entry)|year=2014|location=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The term ''trope'' derives from the Greek {{lang|el|[[wikt:τρόπος|τρόπος]]}} (''tropos''), "turn, direction, way", derived from the verb τρέπειν (''trepein''), "to turn, to direct, to alter, to change".&lt;ref name="trope_mw"&gt;{{citation|title=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|chapter=trope|year=2009|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trope|accessdate=2009-10-16|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|location=[[Springfield, Massachusetts]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropes and their classification were an important field in [[Rhetoric|classical rhetoric]]. The study of tropes has been taken up again in modern criticism, especially in [[deconstruction]].&lt;ref name="childers"/&gt; Tropological criticism (not to be confused with [[tropological reading]], a type of biblical [[exegesis]]) is the historical study of tropes, which aims to "define the dominant tropes of an epoch" and to "find those tropes in literary and non-literary texts", an interdisciplinary investigation of which [[Michel Foucault]] was an "important exemplar".&lt;ref name="childers"/&gt;

==In medieval writing==
A specialized use is the medieval [[Amplification (rhetoric)|amplification]] of texts from the liturgy, such as in the ''[[Kyrie|Kyrie Eleison]]'' (''Kyrie, / magnae Deus potentia, / liberator hominis, / transgressoris mandati, / eleison''). The most important example of such a trope is the ''[[Quem quaeritis?]]'', an amplification before the ''[[Introit]]'' of the [[Easter Sunday]] service and the source for [[liturgical drama]].&lt;ref name=cuddon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuddon|first=J. A.|first2=C. E.|last2=Preston|title=The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory|edition=4|year=1998|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=9780140513639|page=721|chapter=Quem quaeritis trope}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular practice came to an end with the [[Tridentine Mass]], the unification of the liturgy in 1570 promulgated by [[Pope Pius V]].&lt;ref name="childers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Childers|first1=Joseph|last2=Hentzi|first2=Gary|title=The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism|year=1995|publisher=Columbia UP|location=New York|isbn=9780231072434|page=309|chapter=Trope}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types and examples==
[[Rhetoric]]ians have closely analyzed the great variety of "twists and turns" used in [[poetry]] and [[literature]] and have provided an extensive list of precise labels for these poetic devices. These include:

* [[Allegory]] – A sustained metaphor continued through whole sentences or even through a whole discourse. For example: "The ship of state has sailed through rougher storms than the tempest of these lobbyists."
* [[Antanaclasis]] – The stylistic trope of repeating a single word, but with a different meaning each time; antanaclasis is a common type of [[pun]], and like other kinds of pun, it is often found in slogans.
*[[Hyperbole]]
*[[Irony]] – Creating a trope through implying the opposite of the standard meaning, such as describing a bad situation as "good times".
*[[Litotes]]
* [[Metaphor]] – An explanation of an object or idea through juxtaposition of disparate things with a similar characteristic, such as describing a courageous person as having a "heart of a lion".
* [[Metonymy]] – A trope through proximity or correspondence. For example, referring to actions of the U.S. President as "actions of the White House".
*[[Oxymoron]]
*[[Synecdoche]] – Related to metonymy and metaphor, creates a play on words by referring to something with a related concept: for example, referring to the whole with the name of a part, such as "hired hands" for workers; a part with the name of the whole, such as "the law" for police officers; the general with the specific, such as "bread" for food; the specific with the general, such as "cat" for a lion; or an object with its substance, such as "bricks and mortar" for a building.

For a longer list, see [[Figure of speech#Tropes|Figure of speech: Tropes]].

[[Kenneth Burke]] has called metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche and irony the "four master tropes".&lt;ref name="Burke"&gt;

[[File:Llewellyn Cadwaladr Grave Brookwood.jpg|thumb|160px|right|The unmarked grave of the actor [[Llewellyn Cadwaladr]] in [[Brookwood Cemetery]] in the UK]]
An '''unmarked grave''' is one that lacks a marker, headstone, or nameplate indicating that a body is buried there.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|title= Entertainment: 10 Famous People Buried in Unmarked Graves| url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/10-famous-people-unmarked-graves.htm||author=Hoyt, Alia |work=How Stuff Works }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=MySanAntonio|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/life/article/Using-radar-to-find-unmarked-graves-1352153.php|title=Using radar to find unmarked graves|date=May 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in cultures that mark [[cemetery|burial sites]], the phrase '''unmarked grave''' has taken on a [[metaphor]]ical meaning.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Metaphorical meaning==
As a [[figure of speech]], a common meaning of the term "unmarked grave" is consignment to an ignominious end. A [[grave (burial)|grave]] monument (or [[headstone]]) is a sign of respect or fondness, erected with the intention of commemorating and remembering a person.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Criminals===
Conversely, a deliberately unmarked grave may signify disdain and contempt. The underlying intention of some unmarked graves may be to suggest that the person buried is not worthy of commemoration, and should therefore be completely ignored and forgotten, e.g., [[Seung-Hui Cho]], [[Dylan Klebold]], [[Adam Lanza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/location-adam-lanzas-body-mass-shooters-unknown/story?id=18100476 |title=The Location of Adam Lanza's Body, Like Most Mass Shooters, Is Unknown|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unmarked graves have long been used to bury [[executed]] [[criminals]] as an added degree of disgrace. Similarly, many 18th and 19th century prisons and [[mental asylum]]s historically used numbered (but otherwise featureless) markers in their inmate cemeteries, which allowed for record-keeping and visitations while also minimizing the shame associated with having one's family name on permanent display in such a disreputable context. [[Oise-Aisne American Cemetery Plot E|Plot E]] at [[Oise-Aisne American Cemetery]] (consisting entirely of soldiers executed for rape and/or murder) is a rare example of this policy persisting into the 20th century. More recently, the practice has been to [[Cremation|cremate]] and secretly scatter the ashes of notorious criminals in some anonymous place. This was the fate of [[Nazi]] [[war criminals]] such as [[Adolf Eichmann]], [[Hermann Göring]], [[Heinrich Himmler#Capture and suicide|Heinrich Himmler]], [[Fritz Sauckel]], and [[Julius Streicher]]. The remains of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[serial killers]] [[Myra Hindley]], [[Dr Harold Shipman]], and [[Fred West]] were treated in the same way. The headstone of disgraced television presenter and sex offender [[Jimmy Savile]] was removed and destroyed three weeks after being erected, when posthumous allegations of sexual abuse over decades came to light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-19893373 |title=Jimmy Savile's headstone removed from Scarborough cemetery}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cremation and secret scattering of the ashes has the additional effect of removing all possibility of there being a grave to visit in the future.

===Judaism===
In [[Judaism]], contact with a corpse confers uncleanness (see [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 19:11-22 and [[Oholot|Tractate Oholoth]] in the [[Mishna]]). Cohanim, descendants of Aaron, are prohibited from approaching within 4 cubits of a grave, except for when a funeral is of a close relative. Thus, an unmarked grave opens up the possibility that a pious Jew could become defiled without being aware that it happened. The Jews of early times, therefore, sought to avoid unmarked graves by two means: clearly designating cemeteries beyond the limits of their villages and cities, and making graves and tombs obvious by whitewashing them. This is the background for [[Jesus]]' comparison of the [[Pharisees]] of his time to white-washed tombs (see [[Matthew 23]]:27-28) and to "unmarked graves, which men walk over without knowing it" ([[Luke 11]]:44). Jesus warned that the Pharisees were defiling others by their hypocrisy, misplaced priorities, and selfish ambition.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Other reasons for unmarked graves==
However, disdain and contempt are not the only reasons why graves remain unmarked.

As Alicia Hoyt reports: "Historically, financial limitations and social status were factors in whether a person (even a famous one) was awarded a big fancy marker. Mass, unmarked graves were also common in times of widespread disease or war; plus older markers simply deteriorated over time or were stolen. Another reason might be: other gravesites reflect the wishes of the deceased or family members who simply don't want a marker, can't decide on wording, or plan to add one down the line when a loved one passes away and joins them in the plot. [sources: Texas Historical Commission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Texas Historical Commission |title=Locating Unmarked Graves |url=http://www.thc.state.tx.us/unmarked-graves |accessdate=November 18, 2013 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911232312/http://www.thc.state.tx.us/unmarked-graves |archivedate=September 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Washington Post''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Washington Post|title=The "Bone Finder" uses ground-penetrating radar to find lost graves at Congressional|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/the-bone-finder-uses-ground-penetrating-radar-to-find-lost-graves-at-congressional/2013/12/13/9518d3e4-6441-11e3-91b3-f2bb96304e34_story.html|author=Binkovitz, Leah|date= December 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]"&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Additionally, "modern celebrity concerns" may be related to a desire for privacy or to avoid vandalism.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; For example, [[Apple, Inc.]] founder [[Steve Jobs]] (whose grave site lacks a headstone), Academy Award-winning actor [[George C. Scott]], musician [[Frank Zappa]], comedian [[John Belushi]], and writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]] (discussed below) are notable people whose burial sites have been left unmarked (or marked deceptively) for reasons that are not financial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Find A Grave|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/77692175|title=Steve Jobs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases when a person's remains are lost, a [[cenotaph]] may be erected. This is what happened to [[comedian]] [[John Belushi]]. The gravestone at his grave in a [[Martha's Vineyard]] cemetery was removed and relocated, after operators of the cemetery found many signs of [[vandalism]] and rowdiness, where his body lies. In response, a [[cenotaph]] gravestone was erected at a nearby empty grave, to deter disrespectful visitors, leaving his actual final resting place without a marker. Another John Belushi [[cenotaph]] gravestone was erected by his family in a [[Chicago]] area cemetery, at the Belushi family plot, where his parents are now buried.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Similarly, when [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s headstone in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] was stolen, a replacement marker was erected in a different location.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Deceased monarchs and princes of [[Saudi Arabia]] are buried in unmarked graves in the public [[Al Oud cemetery]] in [[Riyadh]]. There is also typically no public funeral or national show of mourning. The [[Wahhabism|Wahhabi]] sect of [[Sunni Islam]] practiced in Saudi Arabia considers public shows of grief or memorials to the dead to be un-Islamic, and therefore the [[House of Saud|royal family]] typically practices austere, private burials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4743085.stm|title=Analysis: The Saudi way of death|date=3 August 2005|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Numerous works, such as moving pictures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/find?q=unmarked%20grave&amp;s=tt&amp;ref_=fn_al_tt_mr|title=Moving pictures whose titles include the phrase "unmarked grave"}}&lt;/ref&gt; photographs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bing.com/search?q=photograpy+unmarked+grave&amp;pc=MOZI&amp;form=MOZLBR|title=Photographs whose titles include the phrase "unmarked grave"|website=Bing Search Results}}&lt;/ref&gt; and written works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=unmarked+grave|website=Goodreads|title=Written works whose titles include the phrase "unmarked grave"}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been titled some variation of "Unmarked Grave".

'''Utopian studies''' is an interdisciplinary field of study that researches utopianism in all its forms, including utopian politics, utopian literature and art, utopian theory, and intentional communities. The term utopia was created by [[Thomas More]] in [[Utopia (book)|a book with the same name]] in 1516.

{{No footnotes|date=March 2013}}

'''Wenedyk''' ({{lang-en|'''Venedic'''}}) is a naturalistic [[constructed language]], created by the Dutch translator [[Jan van Steenbergen]] (who also co-created the international auxiliary language [[Interslavic language|Interslavic]]). It is used in the fictional ''Republic of the Two Crowns'' (based on the ''[[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Republic of Two Nations]]''), in the [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate timeline]] of [[Ill Bethisad]]. Officially, Wenedyk is a descendant of [[Vulgar Latin]] with a strong [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] admixture, based on the premise that the [[Roman Empire]] incorporated the ancestors of the [[Poles]] in their territory. Less officially, it tries to show what [[Polish language|Polish]] would have looked like if it had been a [[Romance languages|Romance]] instead of a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] language. On the Internet, it is well-recognized as an example of the [[altlang]] genre, much like [[Brithenig]] and Breathanach.

The idea for the language was inspired by such languages as Brithenig and Breathanach, languages that bear a similar relationship to the Celtic languages as Wenedyk does to Polish. The language itself is based entirely on ([[Vulgar Latin|Vulgar]]) [[Latin]] and [[Polish language|Polish]]: all phonological, morphological, and syntactic changes that made Polish develop from [[Common Slavic language|Common Slavic]] are applied to Vulgar Latin. As a result, vocabulary and morphology are predominantly Romance in nature, whereas phonology, orthography and syntax are essentially the same as in Polish. Wenedyk uses the modern standard [[Polish orthography]], including (for instance) {{angle bracket|w}} for {{IPA|/v/}} and {{angle bracket|ł}} for {{IPA|/w/}}.

Wenedyk plays a role in the [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] of Ill Bethisad, where it is one of the official languages of the [http://steen.free.fr/rtc/index.html Republic of the Two Crowns]. In 2005 Wenedyk underwent a major revision due to a better understanding of Latin and Slavic sound and grammar changes. In the process, the author was assisted by the Polish linguist Grzegorz Jagodziński.

The dictionary on the WWW page linked below contains over 4000 entries.

The language has acquired some media attention in Poland, including a few online news articles and an article in the monthly ''Wiedza i Życie'' ("Knowledge and Life").

== Spelling and pronunciation ==

Wenedyk uses the [[Polish alphabet]], which consists of the following 32 letters :

:'''A Ą B C Ć D E Ę F G H I J K L Ł M N Ń O Ó P R S Ś T U W Y Z Ź Ż'''

Also, there are seven digraphs, representing five phonemes (ch being identical with h, and rz with ż):

:'''Ch Cz Dz Dź Dż Rz Sz'''

Pronunciation is exactly as in Polish. Stress almost always falls on the penultimate [[syllable]]. A [[preposition]] and a [[pronoun]] are generally treated as one word, and therefore, when the pronoun has only one syllable, the preposition is stressed.

(In theory, the construction of Wenedyk enables relatively easy construction of other "Slavo-Romance" languages. The Romance "mirror" for [[Czech language|Czech]], for example, is called "Šležan"; [http://steen.free.fr/slezan/index.html] another for [[Slovak language|Slovak]], although somewhat looser than the other two as it uses a partially [[Hungarian alphabet|Hungarian orthography]], is called "Slevan". [http://wiki.frath.net/Slevan])

== Grammar ==

=== Nouns and adjectives ===
Wenedyk does not have [[article (grammar)|articles]]. This is a feature that distinguishes Wenedyk from all natural Romance languages. The reason for this is that [[Vulgar Latin]] showed only a rudimentary tendency toward the formation of articles, whereas they are absent in Polish and most other Slavic languages.

Nouns, pronouns and adjectives can have three [[grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine, neuter), two [[grammatical number|numbers]] (singular, plural), and three [[grammatical case|cases]]:
* the ''direct case'': used for both the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and the [[direct object]] of a sentence. In the sentence: '''''Miej poterz'' leże ''libier''''' "My father reads a book", ''Miej poterz'' "my father" and ''libier'' "a book" are both in the direct case.
* the ''[[genitive case]]'': used to indicate possession, for example: '''siedź ''potrze''''' "''my father's'' chair", '''rzejna ''Anglie''''' "the queen ''of England''".
* the ''[[dative case]]'': used to indicate the [[indirect object]] of a sentence, for example: '''Da ''mi'' ił libier''' "Give ''me'' that book", '''Da ''mi'' łu''' "Give it ''to me''".
Wenedyk also has a ''[[vocative case]]''. In most cases it has the same form as the direct case, but there are exceptions: '''O potrze!''' "Oh father!"

Noun can be subdivided into four [[declension]]s. They are similar to the declension system in Latin:
* the ''first declension'' are all words on '''-a''', the vast majority of which are [[feminine]];
* the ''second declension'' are mostly masculine and neuter words ending with a [[consonant]]. It is a mixture of the second and fourth declension in Latin;
* the ''third declension'' are mostly feminine words ending with a soft consonant;
* the ''fourth declension'' are words on '''-ej''', it matches the Latin fifth declension.

[[Adjective]]s always agree in gender, number and case with the noun they modify. They can be placed both before and after it.

=== Pronouns ===
Unlike nouns, adjectives and other pronouns, [[personal pronoun]]s do not use the direct case, but preserve the distinction between the [[nominative case|nominative]] and [[accusative case|accusative]] instead. They are displayed in the following chart:

|align="center" colspan="3"|''they&lt;br&gt;them&lt;br&gt;theirs&lt;br&gt;to them''
|}

=== Verbs ===
[[Verb]]s are inflected for person, number, mood and tense. The forms in the present tense are:
:''1 sg.'' &amp;ndash; '''jemu''' "I love"
:''2 sg.'' &amp;ndash; '''jemasz''' "you love"
:''3 sg.'' &amp;ndash; '''jema''' "he/she loves"
:''1 pl.'' &amp;ndash; '''jemamy''' "we love"
:''2 pl.'' &amp;ndash; '''jemacie''' "you love"
:''3 pl.'' &amp;ndash; '''jemą''' "they love"
Because Latin and [[Proto-Slavonic]] had virtually identical person/number inflections, Wenedyk and Polish do also.

Wenedyk verbs have the following [[grammatical mood|moods]] and [[grammatical tense|tenses]]:
:''[[infinitive]]'' &amp;ndash; '''jemar''' "to love"
:''[[present tense]]'' &amp;ndash; '''jemu''' "I love, I am loving"
:''[[imperfect]]'' &amp;ndash; '''jemawa''' "I loved"
:''[[perfect (grammar)|perfect]]'' &amp;ndash; '''jemie''' " I have loved"
:''[[future tense]] ([[imperfective aspect|imperfective]])'' &amp;ndash; '''joru jemar''' "I will love, I will be loving"
:''[[future tense]] ([[perfective aspect|perfective]])'' &amp;ndash; '''jemaru''' "I will have loved"
:''[[conditional mood]]'' &amp;ndash; '''jemarsi''' "I would love, I would have loved"
:''[[imperative mood]]'' &amp;ndash; '''jem''' "love!"
:''[[participle|present active participle]] &amp;ndash; '''jemęć''' "loving"
:''[[participle|perfect passive participle]] &amp;ndash; '''jematy''' "beloved"

== Word list ==

Wenedyk vocabulary as published on the internet consists of over 4000 words. Because of how it was developed from Vulgar Latin, Wenedyk words are closest to [[Italian language|Italian]], but with phonologic differences from Italian which may be compared to those distinguishing [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] from [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The following charts of 30 shows what Wenedyk looks like in comparison to a number of other Romance languages; note that unlike [[Brithenig]], where one-quarter of the words resembled Welsh words, only four Wenedyk words (not counting ''szkoła'', borrowed into Polish from Latin) resemble Polish words, due to the Slavic languages' greater distance from the Romance languages compared to the Celtic languages:

==Similar languages==
In the Ill Bethisad universe, there are two other languages which are related to Wenedyk: Slevan, which is spoken in that universe's counterpart of [[Slovakia]]; and Šležan, or Silesian, spoken in [[Silesia]]. Šležan mirrors [[Czech language|Czech]] [http://steen.free.fr/slezan/index.html] [http://steen.free.fr/slezan/gmp.html] in much the same way Wenedyk does Polish, whereas Slevan, despite being located in Slovakia, is more similar to [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] in its orthography. (The Romance "mirror" of Slovak is a dialect of Slevan spoken in [[Moravia]] called Moravľaňec.) (As if in compensation, [[Croatian language|Croatian]] in Ill Bethisad is forced to be noticeably different from [[Serbian language|Serbian]] by being made to resemble the now-virtually-missing Czech and Slovak. [http://ib.frath.net/w/Croatian] )

Additionally, in the famous ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' series, the fictional language [[Syldavian]] may be thought of as the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] counterpart of Wenedyk, showing what Polish might have looked like if it were a Germanic and not a Slavic language. The nearly extinct [[Wymysorys language]] provides another real-life example of this. Ill Bethisad also has such a "Slavo-Germanic" language: Bohemian, spoken in that universe's [[Czech Republic]], developed by amateur [[Czech people|Czech]] linguist Jan Havliš.

The '''World Index of Moral Freedom'''&lt;ref&gt;'''[http://www.fundalib.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/World-Index-of-Moral-Freedom-web.pdf World Index of Moral Freedom (WIMF)]'''&lt;/ref&gt; is an international index ranking one hundred and sixty countries on their performance on five categories of indicators: '''religious freedom''' (taking into account both the freedom to practice any religion or none, and the situation of religious control on the state); '''bioethical freedom''' (including the legal status of abortion, euthanasia and other practices pertaining to bioethics, like surrogacy or stem cell research); '''drugs freedom''' (including the legal status of cannabis and the country's general policy on hard drugs); '''sexual freedom''' (including the legal status of pornography and sex services among consenting adults, and the country's age of sexual consent), and '''family and gender freedom''' (including women's freedom of movement, the legal status of cohabitation of unmarried couples, same sex marriage and the situation of transgender people). The index is sponsored and published by the Foundation for the Advancement of Liberty, a [[libertarian]] [[think tank]] based in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. The WIMF's first edition was published on April 2, 2016, co-authored by Foundation researchers Andreas Kohl and Juan Pina. A second edition was published by the same foundation in July, 2018, this time authored by Juan Pina and Emma Watson.

== Purpose ==
The World Index of Moral Freedom aims at completing the views presented by other international [[freedom indices]] measuring general freedom or aspects thereof (press freedom, economic freedom, etcetera). To do so, the Index aims at responding a simple question: how free from state-imposed moral constraints are human beings depending on their countries of residence? The research conducted tries to determine the degree of individual freedom to take decisions pertaining to the great moral debates of our time. The first edition of the WIMF includes a short note on the comparison between its country ranking and those of the other freedom indices.

== Categories studied and classification of countries ==
Each category of indicators is worth twenty points (20% of the total score) and aims at responding the following questions:
* '''''Category A.''''' Religious indicators. How free is the practice of any religion or none, and how religious-controlled is the state.
* '''''Category B.''''' Bioethical indicators. How free is individual decision making on matters posing bioethical questions.
* '''''Category C.''''' Drugs indicators. How free is the production, trade and consumption of substances deemed harmful.
* '''''Category D.''''' Sexuality indicators. How free are sexual intercourse, pornography and sex services among consenting adults.
* '''''Category E.''''' Gender &amp; family indicators. How free are women, LGBT individuals and unmarried couples living together.

Each category is made up of various indicators (normally one or two leading indicators adjusted by one or two lesser wheighted ones), the weight of which is set in view of their inferred relevance towards the category's overall score. Countries have been classified towards each category according to the information available in the sources reviewed. All category results and the general index itself are presented in a 0-100 point scale. Countries are classified according to the following intervals:
* 90-100 points – ''Highest moral freedom''
* 80-90 points – ''Very high moral freedom''
* 60-80 points – ''High moral freedom''
* 50-60 points – ''Acceptable moral freedom''
* 40-50 points – ''Insufficient moral freedom''
* 20-40 points – ''Low moral freedom''
* 10-20 points – ''Very low moral freedom''
* 0-10 points – ''Lowest moral freedom''

== Findings of the WIMF's first edition ==

=== State of moral freedom around the world ===
Only one country, the [[Netherlands]], is classified as having the "highest" level of moral freedom by scoring slightly over the 90 points required for that label. Just four countries make it into the upper twenty points, and only ten pass the 75 point threshold. Out of the 160 countries considered, only 64 "pass the exam" and score 50 points or more. And around 30% of all countries fall in the "low", "very low" or "lowest" moral freedom areas of the index. Technology and the cultural globalization that it produces are deemed by the authors to be the most powerful driving forces towards acceptance of individual moral freedom.

=== Netherlands ===
With a three-point (three per cent) advantage over their closest competitor and eight points over the third, the Netherlands top the 2016 country ranking. The Dutch score is twenty-one points higher than the average of all countries enjoying "high" or "very high" moral freedom. For many decades, whenever moral freedom was discussed, the Netherlands had the least interventionist policies. The first country to fight [[human trafficking]] by legalising sex services performed by [[consenting adults]], or to normalize the use of [[cannabis]], or to acknowledge [[same sex marriage]] already in 2001, performs remarkably high in most indicators considered towards the index.

=== Latin countries ===
A trend may be inferred towards international unification of the legal and political approach to moral issues. And that trend favours the Western world's predominant choice for low moral interference by the state. This is particularly noticeable when looking at the index performance of many Southern European and [[Latin American]] countries, which seem to reveal a fast cultural evolution from traditional, conservative values into a laissez-faire approach to morality. Four of the top ten countries are Latin American or Iberian, while six other Latin countries in Southern Europe and the Americas make it to the "high moral freedom" region of the index. The particular performance of countries like [[Portugal]] or [[Uruguay]] is much higher than their recent history would indicate. These and other Latin countries seem to have discarded their traditional background of religiously influenced governance.

=== Islamic countries and other religious-influenced states ===
The fifteen lowest scoring countries at the World Index of Moral Freedom are [[Islamic]] and located in the [[Persian Gulf]], North-Eastern [[Africa]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. This is also true for the region's economically free enclaves in the area. [[Saudi Arabia]] comes last (160th) in the ranking and doesn't even score ten points out of the one hundred potentially available. Only four predominantly Islamic countries obtain more than fifty points: [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Albania]], [[Turkey]] and [[Kazakhstan]]. A few non Islamic countries also show low levels of moral freedom which the authors consider likely to be due to a strong political leverage held by another [[religion]]. These include [[Belarus]] ([[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]), [[Israel]] ([[Jewish]]), [[Nepal]] ([[Hinduist]]), the [[Philippines]] ([[Catholic]]), [[Thailand]] ([[Buddhist]]), [[Tonga]] ([[Methodist]]), or [[Tuvalu]] ([[Calvinist]]).

=== Russia ===
In [[Russia]], moral [[conservatism]], derived from either the Orthodox faith or traditional culture, seems to have replaced [[marxism]] as the basis for an ongoing, though softer, social engineering by the state. Russia's score is just in the middle of the classification, a position shared by some of her cultural and political allies, like [[Serbia]] or [[Moldova]], while politically unfree [[Belarus]] falls further below. In all of these countries, the freedom of [[LGBT]] individuals is a matter of particular concern.

=== Communist countries ===
The remaining [[communist]] regimes coerce their citizens into abiding by a moral code based on allegedly scientific views. Freedom of conscience and the practice of any religion are repressed. In the case of the [[People's Republic of China]], decades of limited economic liberalization have not resulted in an equally noticeable moral openness. Two other communist regimes, [[North Korea]] and [[Vietnam]], fall further down into the low moral freedom area, while moral freedom is deemed insufficient in [[Laos]] and just slightly over the fifty point threshold in socialist [[Venezuela]] or in outright communist [[Cuba]].

=== Other findings ===
For different reasons, often including abnormally low scores in a particular set of indicators, a few Western countries which perform reasonably high in other freedom indices rank rather low at the WIMF. [[Hungary]] and [[Norway]] fail to make it into the "high moral freedom" area, although just for under half a point. The [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] performance is particularly low within the moral freedom area. [[Iceland]], [[Japan]], [[Poland]] and [[Romania]] barely manage to pass the fifty point mark, while [[Singapore]], [[Israel]] or [[South Korea]] fall in the "insufficient moral freedom" part of the index. While most countries topping the WIMF in its first edition belong to the [[developed world]], some countries with a lesser degree of development have also made their way into the higher classification areas. [[Cambodia]], scoring just over seventy points, obtains the fifteenth place in the global classification and is the first developing country in the index. It is also worth noting that the four European micro-states considered −the principalities of [[Andorra]] and [[Monaco]] and the republics of [[San Marino]] and [[Malta]]− score surprisingly low in comparison with their bigger neighbours. In spite of their high [[living standards]] and [[economic freedom]], these countries fail to perform similarly when it comes to moral freedom. A similar situation is observed in Caribbean and South Pacific island micro-states, which score poorly in most categories and rank in the lower areas of the WIMF classification. This similarity between very small countries in different regions, in spite of the cultural influence of their neighbours and allies, may lead to the conclusion that moral freedom is affected, among other relevant factors, by country size.

:''This article is about the Cuban taekwondo athlete. For the Puerto Rican politician, see [[Angel Matos García]].''
'''Ángel Valodia Matos Fuentes''' (born December 24, 1976 in [[Holguín]]) is a former [[Cuba]]n [[taekwondo]] athlete. He received a [[gold medal]] at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in [[Sydney]],&lt;ref name=db-ol-TKD2000&gt;[http://www.databaseolympics.com/games/gamessport.htm?g=25&amp;sp=TKD "2000 Summer Olympics&amp;nbsp; – Sydney, Australia&amp;nbsp; – Taekwondo"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823081100/http://www.databaseolympics.com/games/gamessport.htm?g=25&amp;sp=TKD |date=2008-08-23 }} ''databaseOlympics.com'' (Retrieved on April 5, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and added [[Taekwondo at the 2007 Pan American Games|another]] at the [[2007 Pan American Games]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]].

The [[World Taekwondo Federation]] banned Matos and his coach for life following an incident [[Taekwondo at the 2008 Summer Olympics|at the 2008 Summer Olympics]] where Matos kicked the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[referee]] [[Chakir Chelbat]] in the face, after being disqualified in the [[bronze medal]] match. The decision was later ratified by the [[IOC]].&lt;ref name = "SMH_20080825"&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/taekwondo/cuban-kicked-out-after-attacking-referee/2008/08/25/1219516279008.html Cuban kicked out after taekwondo disgrace] ''Sydney Morning Herald Aug 25, 2008''&lt;/ref&gt; He was also banned for life by the same committee.

==2000 Summer Olympics==
[[Taekwondo at the 2000 Summer Olympics|At the 2000 Summer Olympics]], Matos was gold medalist in the men's middleweight (80&amp;nbsp;kg) class.&lt;ref name="time2004"&gt;Staff report (August 9, 2004). [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,994816,00.html The Olympians], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In the first round, he defeated [[Felipe Soto Alvarez]] of [[Chile]] 9–2. In the quarterfinals, he defeated [[Victor Manuel Estrada Garibay]] of [[Mexico]] 2–0, besting [[Sweden|Swede]] [[Roman Livaja]] in the semifinals, 4–0. In the gold medal match Matos defeated [[Germany]]'s [[Faissal Ebnoutalib]] 3–1.&lt;ref name="espn2000"&gt;Staff report (September 29, 2000). [http://static.espn.go.com/oly/summer00/results/taekwondo.html Summer Olympics 2000 Results - Taekwondo] ESPN.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==2004 Summer Olympics==
Matos was the defending Olympic welterweight champion. At the [[2003 Pan American Games]], Matos was defeated 4–1 by eventual gold medalist [[Steven López]].&lt;ref name="weir2004"&gt;Weir, Tom (August 2, 2004). [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/athens/fight/2004-08-02-lopez-cover_x.htm Lopez kicks his way to Athens with help from family], ''[[USA Today]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He was not a medalist [[Taekwondo at the 2004 Summer Olympics|at Athens in 2004]], being ousted by Mexican Estrada 8–7, in the preliminary round of 16.

==2008 Summer Olympics==
In the bronze medal match in the men's 80+ kg class at the [[Taekwondo at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics]], Matos was set against Kazakhstan's [[Arman Chilmanov]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/24/olympics2008.olympicstaekwondo|title=Cuban banned after assault on referee | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=2008-08-24 | accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he incurred a foot injury (at which point he led the match 3-2), he took a [[Kyeshi]]&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; ("suspend", medical timeout). Under [[World Taekwondo Federation]] tournament rules, players sustaining injury are allowed one minute of Kyeshi time, at the end of which the competitor in question must return to the center of the ring to resume the fight, request further time, or forfeit the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtf.org/site/rules/competition.htm#19|title=The World Taekwondo Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sweden|Swedish]] referee [[Chakir Chelbat]] gave a time warning at 40 seconds, but Kyeshi elapsed without Matos returning to the center.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; The referee ruled while he was sitting awaiting medical attention that he had taken too long during his time out and subsequently ruled he had retired.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; "To me it was obvious he was unable to continue," his opponent [[Arman Chilmanov]] of Kazakhstan said. "His toe on his left foot was broken."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/sports/olympics/24taekwondo.html|title=Cuban athlete is barred for kicking referee’s face | work=The New York Times | date=2008-08-24 | accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Chilmanov was declared the winner, Matos briefly argued with Chelbat and then kicked him in the face, punched a judge in the arms, and spat on the floor of the arena before being escorted out by security with his coach, Leudis Gonzalez.&lt;ref name="AFP/Fox"&gt;{{cite web | title = Cuban attacks judge after losing bronze in taekwondo | url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/beijing_olympics/story/0,27313,24231037-5016792,00.html | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | publisher=AFP/Fox }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gBc5uA2gEfcqAO50n1lqHot8aWLAD92O159G0 |title=Cuban taekwondo athlete banned after kicking ref |publisher=AP/Google |date=2008-08-23 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |first=Eric |last=Talmadge |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080825202646/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gBc5uA2gEfcqAO50n1lqHot8aWLAD92O159G0 |archivedate=August 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/taekwondo/news/newsid=251304.html |title=Kicked out: Cuban banned for life |publisher=[[NBC Sports]] |date=August 23, 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824164335/http://www.nbcolympics.com/taekwondo/news/newsid%3D251304.html |archivedate=August 24, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fight, Yang Jin-suk, the secretary general of the World Taekwondo Federation, apologised and said "This is an insult to the Olympic vision, an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and, in my opinion, an insult to mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/23/AR2008082301905.html|title=Cuban Taekwondo Athlete Puts Worst Foot Forward|date=2008-08-24|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hours later, the WTF banned Matos and González from WTF-sanctioned events for life; in a statement announcing its decision, the WTF called Matos' behaviour "a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the Olympic Games."  It also deleted Matos' results from the 2008 Olympics from the records.&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Ian|last= Ransom|title= Cuban banned for referee kick|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Olympics/idUSPEK30514420080823|publisher= [[Reuters]]|date= 2008-08-23|accessdate=2008-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aSGpc2ezfJpI&amp;refer=home|title=Cuban Taekwondo champ faces ban for kicking Olympic ref in head | work=Bloomberg | date=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matos's coach Leudis González said of the referee's initial decision to end the fight, "He was too strict..." and accused the Kazakhstan team of offering bribes.&lt;ref name="AFP/Fox"/&gt; Former Cuban [[president]] [[Fidel Castro]] also defended Matos, saying he was rightfully indignant over his disqualification. "I saw when the judges blatantly stole fights from two Cuban boxers [[Boxing at the 2008 Summer Olympics|in the semifinals]]," Castro wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fidel Castro defends Ángel Matos' actions |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/olympics/2008/08/25/bc.cuba.castro.olympics.ap/index.html?eref=si_latest |work=CNN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080831113340/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/olympics/2008/08/25/bc.cuba.castro.olympics.ap/index.html?eref=si_latest |archivedate=August 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
