'''Introduction'''

The [http://www.accor.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Contenus_Accor/Presse/Country/Asia_Pacific/PR_2011/201108_Survey_Accor_Business_Traveller_Research_2011_Report.pdf Accor Asia Pacific Business Traveller Research] is a study by [[Accor]] Asia Pacific, seeking to better understand the travel and behavioural preferences of business travellers in the [[Asia Pacific]] region. This research is now in its second year and has been updated to reflect market conditions unique to the Asia Pacific region. Accor partnered with [http://www.cimigo.com/ Cimigo Ltd], a research consultancy in Asia Pacific, to conduct the research, with 10,437 Asia Pacific based business travellers from [[Australia]], [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]] and [[Thailand]] were surveyed online about their travel habits in the first half of 2011, and their planned [[business travel]] for the remainder of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Singapore/Hong Kong top destinations for Asia-Pacific business travel|url=http://www.ttgasia.com/article.php?article_id=2035|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=TTG Asia|date=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three key areas of that the study covered include&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Accor Asia Pacific Business Traveller Research 2011|url=http://www.platma.org/index.php/mod.conts/mem.detalle/id.1769/lang.en/chk.4e329e4a0a155626f4fd769bddf5b1d7|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=platma|date=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business travel in the first 6 months of 2011, and planned for the last 6 months of 2011, the process of planning the business trip and the usage of hotel facilities.

&lt;br /&gt;
'''Findings'''

Singapore and Hong Kong tie for the most visited destination by APAC business travelers in the first half of 2011, with Thailand and China come in third and fourth respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheung|first=Tim|title=Business travelers: Who spends the most?|url=http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/life/habits-apac-business-travelers-unraveled-212929|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=CNNGo.com|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the second half of the year, Singapore (39%) and Hong Kong (38%) are also the most likely destinations for business travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chan|first=Rachel|title=S'pore business travellers work till late|url=http://www.asiaone.com/Business/News/Office/Story/A1Story20110728-291406.html|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=AsiaOne|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
In terms of the number of trips made, Asia Pacific business travellers took an average of 6.3 business trips in the first 6 months of 2011. The average number of trips differed by country of residence, with Chinese (8.7 trips), Indian (7.3 trips) and Singaporean (7.1 trips) business travellers ranking the highest, and Thais (5.0 trips), Australians (5.2 trips) and New Zealanders (5.2 trips) ranked lowest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheung|first=Tim|title=Business travelers: Who spends the most?|url=http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/life/habits-apac-business-travelers-unraveled-212929|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=CNNGo.com|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When narrowed down to demographics, the research found that Male business travellers (7.0 trips) were on the road more frequently than females (4.5 trips).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheung|first=Tim|title=Business travelers: Who spends the most?|url=http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/life/habits-apac-business-travelers-unraveled-212929|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=CNNGo.com|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That said, Hong Kong has the largest percentage of female business travelers (36%), followed by Thailand (33%). At the extreme end, only 7 percent of the Indian respondents were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheung|first=Tim|title=Business travelers: Who spends the most?|url=http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/life/habits-apac-business-travelers-unraveled-212929|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=CNNGo.com|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of daily hotel budget during business travel, Asia Pacific's executives average at US$121 with Australian business travelers leading the pack at US$158 per night. Singaporean and Hong Kongers spend US$134 and US$132 respectively. On the other hand, Chinese business travelers are more frugal, spending a mere US$99 a night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheung|first=Tim|title=Business travelers: Who spends the most?|url=http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/life/habits-apac-business-travelers-unraveled-212929|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=CNNGo.com|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Singapore and Chinese business travellers (82%) are most likely to work at the hotel during their business trips. They are followed by Hong Kong business travellers (75%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chan|first=Rachel|title=S'pore business travellers work till late|url=http://www.asiaone.com/Business/News/Office/Story/A1Story20110728-291406.html|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=AsiaOne|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hotel facilities-wise, Indian business travelers are most likely to use both fitness (85%) and spa facilities (64%) than any other nationalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheung|first=Tim|title=Business travelers: Who spends the most?|url=http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/life/habits-apac-business-travelers-unraveled-212929|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=CNNGo.com|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
When it comes to booking travel accommodation, respondents overwhelmingly preferred booking directly online with the hotel brand (57 per cent) followed by the secretary in the company (40%), while offline travel agents were used only by a minority (16%). However, the survey did not delve deeper into how secretaries made the bookings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Singapore/Hong Kong top destinations for Asia-Pacific business travel|url=http://www.ttgasia.com/article.php?article_id=2035|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=TTG Asia|date=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
In the area of environmental consciousness, 90% of Chinese business travellers surveyed said they would choose a hotel that is more environmentally conscious and would even be willing to pay a premium extra for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheung|first=Tim|title=Business travelers: Who spends the most?|url=http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/life/habits-apac-business-travelers-unraveled-212929|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=CNNGo.com|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agner Krarup Erlang''' (1 January 1878 – 3 February 1929) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[mathematician]], [[statistician]] and [[engineer]], who invented the fields of [[teletraffic engineering|traffic engineering]] and [[queueing theory]].

By the time of his relatively early death at the age of 51, Erlang had created the field of [[PSTN|telephone networks]] analysis. His early work in scrutinizing the use of local, exchange and trunk telephone line usage in a small community to understand the theoretical requirements of an efficient network led to the creation of the [[Erlang formula]], which became a foundational element of modern [[telecommunication]] network studies.

== Life ==

Erlang was born at Lønborg, near [[Tarm]], in [[Jutland]].  He was the son of a schoolmaster, and a descendant of [[Thomas Fincke]] on his mother's side.  At age 14, he passed the Preliminary Examination of the [[University of Copenhagen]] with distinction, after receiving dispensation to take it because he was younger than the usual minimum age.  For the next two years he taught alongside his father.

A distant relative provided free board and lodging, and Erlang prepared for and took the University of [[Copenhagen]] entrance examination in 1896, and passed with distinction.  He won a scholarship to the University and majored in [[mathematics]], and also studied [[astronomy]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].  He graduated in 1901 with an MA and over the next 7 years taught at several schools. He maintained his interest in mathematics, and received an award for a paper that he submitted to the University of Copenhagen.

He was a member of the Danish Mathematicians' Association (TBMI) and through this met amateur mathematician [[Johan Jensen (mathematician)|Johan Jensen]], the Chief Engineer of the [[Copenhagen Telephone Company]] (KTAS in Danish), an [[Corporate spin-off|offshoot]] of the [[International Bell Telephone Company]].  Erlang worked for the CTC (KTAS) from 1908 for almost 20 years, until his death in Copenhagen after an abdominal operation.

He was an associate of the British [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]].

== Contributions ==

While working for the CTC, Erlang was presented with the classic problem of determining how many circuits were needed to provide an acceptable telephone service.  His thinking went further by finding how many [[Switchboard operator |telephone operators]] were needed to handle a given volume of calls.  Most [[telephone exchange]]s then used human operators and [[telephone switchboard|cord boards]] to switch [[telephone call]]s by means of jack plugs.

Out of necessity, Erlang was a hands-on researcher.  He would conduct measurements and was prepared to climb into street [[manhole]]s to do so. &lt;!-- He famously said that this was a "no brainer."{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The actual quote in Danish w/translation would be desired. --&gt; He was also an expert in the history and calculation of the numerical tables of mathematical functions, particularly [[logarithm]]s.  He devised new calculation methods for certain forms of tables.

He developed his theory of telephone traffic over several years.  His significant publications include:
* 1909 – "The Theory of Probabilities and Telephone Conversations", which proves that the [[Poisson distribution]] applies to random telephone traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Theory of Probabilities and Telephone Conversations |journal= Nyt Tidsskrift for Matematik |pages= 33-39 |issue= B |volume= 20 |date= 1909 |url= https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0010648031&amp;origin=inward&amp;txGid=c040f22392ef895c6eba0b47f1844f8c }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1917 – "Solution of some Problems in the Theory of Probabilities of Significance in Automatic Telephone Exchanges", which contains his classic formulae for [[Grade of service#Erlang's lost call assumptions|call loss]] and waiting time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Solution of some Problems in the Theory of Probabilities of Significance in Automatic Telephone Exchanges |journal= Elektrotkeknikeren |volume= 13 |page= 5 |date= 1917 |url= http://oldwww.com.dtu.dk/teletraffic/erlangbook/pps138-155.pdf |format= pdf |dead-url= yes |archive-date= July 19, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110719122546/http://oldwww.com.dtu.dk/teletraffic/erlangbook/pps138-155.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These and other notable papers were translated into English, French and German.  His papers were prepared in a very brief style and can be difficult to understand without a background in the field.  One researcher from [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] is said to have learned Danish to study them.

The [[BT Group plc|British Post Office]] accepted his formula as the basis for calculating circuit facilities.

In 1946, the [[CCITT]] named the international unit of telephone traffic "the [[Erlang (unit)|Erlang]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Erlang}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A statistical distribution and programming language listed below have also been named in his honour.

'''Analytics''' is the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in [[data]] and applying those patterns towards effective decision making. In other words, analytics can be understood as the connective tissue between data and effective decision making, within an organization. Especially valuable in areas rich with recorded information, analytics relies on the simultaneous application of [[statistics]], [[computer programming]] and [[operations research]] to quantify performance. 

Organizations may apply analytics to business data to describe, predict, and improve business performance. Specifically, areas within analytics include [[predictive analytics]], [[prescriptive analytics]], [[enterprise decision management]], descriptive analytics, cognitive analytics, Big Data Analytics, retail analytics, supply chain analytics, store assortment and [[stock-keeping unit]] optimization, marketing optimization and [[marketing mix modeling]], [[web analytics]], call analytics, [[speech analytics]], sales force sizing and optimization, price and promotion modeling, predictive science, credit [[risk analysis (business)|risk analysis]], and [[fraud detection|fraud analytics]]. Since analytics can require extensive computation (see [[big data]]), the algorithms and software used for analytics harness the most current methods in computer science, statistics, and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kohavi, Rothleder and Simoudis|title=Emerging Trends in Business Analytics|journal=Communications of the ACM|year=2002|volume=45|issue=8|pages=45–48|doi=10.1145/545151.545177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analytics vs. analysis ==

{{Confusing section|reason=it is still not clear what the difference between analytics and analysis is|small=no|date=March 2018}}

Analysis is focused on understanding the past; what happened.  Analytics focuses on why it happened and what will happen next.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=36&amp;doc_id=1332172|title=Analysis vs. Analytics: Past vs. Future|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data analytics is a [[academic discipline|multidisciplinary]] field. There is extensive use of computer skills, mathematics and statistics, the use of descriptive techniques and predictive models to gain valuable knowledge from data.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. The insights from data are used to recommend action or to guide decision making rooted in business context. Thus, analytics is not so much concerned with individual analyses or analysis steps, but with the entire [[methodology]]{{according to whom|date=March 2018}}. There is a pronounced tendency to use the term ''analytics'' in business settings e.g. [[text analytics]] vs. the more generic [[text mining]] to emphasize this broader perspective. {{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} There is an increasing use of the term ''advanced analytics'',{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} typically used to describe the technical aspects of analytics, especially in the emerging fields such as the use of [[machine learning]] techniques like [[neural networks]], Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, linear to multiple regression analysis, Classification to do [[predictive modeling]]. It also includes Unsupervised Machine learning techniques like cluster analysis, Principal Component Analysis, segmentation profile analysis and association analysis.

== Application of analytics ==

=== Marketing optimization ===
Marketing has evolved from a creative process into a highly data-driven process. Marketing organizations use analytics to determine the outcomes of campaigns or efforts and to guide decisions for investment and consumer targeting. Demographic studies, customer segmentation, conjoint analysis and other techniques allow marketers to use large amounts of consumer purchase, survey and panel data to understand and communicate marketing strategy.

[[Web analytics]] allows marketers to collect session-level information about interactions on a website using an operation called [[sessionization]]. [[Google Analytics]] is an example of a popular free analytics tool that marketers use for this purpose. Those interactions provide web analytics information systems with the information necessary to track the referrer, search keywords, identify IP address, and track activities of the visitor. With this information, a marketer can improve marketing campaigns, website creative content, and information architecture.

Analysis techniques frequently used in marketing include marketing mix modeling, pricing and promotion analyses, sales force optimization and customer analytics e.g.: segmentation. Web analytics and optimization of web sites and online campaigns now frequently work hand in hand with the more traditional marketing analysis techniques. A focus on digital media has slightly changed the vocabulary so that ''marketing mix modeling'' is commonly referred to as ''attribution modeling'' in the digital or [[marketing mix modeling]] context.

These tools and techniques support both strategic marketing decisions (such as how much overall to spend on marketing, how to allocate budgets across a portfolio of brands and the marketing mix) and more tactical campaign support, in terms of targeting the best potential customer with the optimal message in the most cost effective medium at the ideal time.

=== People analytics ===
People Analytics is using behavioral data to understand how people work and change how companies are managed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://professional.mit.edu/programs/short-programs/people-analytics|title=People Analytics: Transforming Management with Behavioral Data|last=lukem|date=2016-11-04|work=Programs for Professionals {{!}} MIT Professional Education|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People analytics is also known as workforce analytics, HR analytics, talent analytics, people insights, talent insights, colleague insights, human capital analytics, and HRIS analytics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.analyticsinhr.com/blog/difference-between-people-analytics-and-hr-analytics/|title=[VIDEO] The Difference Between People Analytics and HR Analytics|date=2018-03-08|work=Analytics in HR|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; HR analytics is the application of analytics to help companies manage [[human resources]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The aim is to discern which employees to hire, which to reward or promote, what responsibilities to assign, and similar human resource problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-people-analytics|title=People analytics - University of Pennsylvania|publisher=Coursera}}&lt;/ref&gt; HR analytics is becoming increasingly important to understand what kind of behavioral profiles would succeed and fail. For example, an analysis may find that individuals that fit a certain type of profile are those most likely to succeed at a particular role, making them the best employees to hire.

However, there are key differences between people analytics and HR analytics. “People Analytics solves business problems. HR Analytics solves HR problems. People Analytics looks at the work and its social organization. HR Analytics measures and integrates data about HR administrative processes,” says Ben Waber, [[MIT Media Lab]] Ph.D. and CEO of [[Humanyze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrexaminer.com/people-analytics-mit-july-24-2017/|title=People Analytics: MIT July 24, 2017|date=2017-08-02|work=HR Examiner|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josh Bersin, founder and principal at Bersin by [[Deloitte]] agrees that people analytics is a larger industry than HR Analytics, explaining, “'''…''' over time, I believe it doesn't even belong within HR. While it may reside in HR to begin with, over time this team takes responsible for analysis of sales productivity, turnover, retention, accidents, fraud, and even the people-issues that drive customer retention and customer satisfaction… These are all real-world business problems''',''' ''not HR problems'''''.'''”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2015/02/01/geeks-arrive-in-hr-people-analytics-is-here/#339ceb1673b4|title=The Geeks Arrive In HR:  People Analytics Is Here|last=Bersin|first=Josh|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Portfolio analytics ===
A common application of business analytics is [[portfolio analysis]]. In this, a [[bank]] or lending agency has a collection of accounts of varying [[Value (economics)|value]] and [[risk]]. The accounts may differ by the social status (wealthy, middle-class, poor, etc.) of the holder, the geographical location, its net value, and many other factors. The lender must balance the return on the [[loan]] with the risk of default for each loan. The question is then how to evaluate the portfolio as a whole.

The least risk loan may be to the very wealthy, but there are a very limited number of wealthy people. On the other hand, there are many poor that can be lent to, but at greater risk. Some balance must be struck that maximizes return and minimizes risk. The analytics solution may combine [[time series]] analysis with many other issues in order to make decisions on when to lend money to these different borrower segments, or decisions on the interest rate charged to members of a portfolio segment to cover any losses among members in that segment.

=== Risk analytics ===

Predictive models in the banking industry are developed to bring certainty across the risk scores for individual customers. Credit scores are built to predict individual’s delinquency behavior and widely used to evaluate the credit worthiness of each applicant. Furthermore, risk analyses are carried out in the scientific world and the insurance industry. It is also extensively used in financial institutions like Online Payment Gateway companies to analyse if a transaction was genuine or fraud. For this purpose they use the transaction history of the customer. This is more commonly used in Credit Card purchase, when there is a sudden spike in the customer transaction volume the customer gets a call of confirmation if the transaction was initiated by him/her. This helps in reducing loss due to such circumstances.

=== Digital analytics ===
Digital analytics is a set of business and technical activities that define, create, collect, verify or transform digital data into reporting, research, analyses, recommendations, optimizations, predictions, and automations.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Judah "Building a Digital Analytics Organization" Financial Times Press, 2013, pp 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; This also includes the SEO ([[search engine optimization]]) where the keyword search is tracked and that data is used for marketing purposes. Even banner ads and clicks come under digital analytics. A growing number of brands and marketing firms rely on digital analytics for their digital marketing assignments, where MROI (Marketing Return on Investment) is an important key performance indicator (KPI).

=== Security analytics ===
Security analytics refers to information technology (IT) to gather and analyze security events to understand and analyze events that pose the greatest risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Security analytics shores up hope for breach detection |url=http://enterpriseinnovation.net/article/security-analytics-shores-hope-breach-detection-192448485|publisher=Enterprise Innovation|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Products in this area include [[security information and event management]] and user behavior analytics.

=== Software analytics ===
{{main|Software analytics}}
Software analytics is the process of collecting information about the way a piece of [[software]] is used and produced.

== Challenges ==
In the industry of commercial analytics software, an emphasis has emerged on solving the challenges of analyzing massive, complex data sets, often when such data is in a constant state of change. Such data sets are commonly referred to as [[big data]]. Whereas once the problems posed by big data were only found in the scientific community, today big data is a problem for many businesses that operate transactional systems online and, as a result, amass large volumes of data quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Naone|first=Erica|title=The New Big Data|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/38397/|publisher=Technology Review, MIT|accessdate=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of [[unstructured data]] types is another challenge getting attention in the industry. Unstructured data differs from [[structured data]] in that its format varies widely and cannot be stored in traditional relational databases without significant effort at data transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Inmon|first1=Bill|last2=Nesavich|first2=Anthony|title=Tapping Into Unstructured Data|year=2007|publisher=Prentice-Hall|isbn=978-0-13-236029-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of unstructured data, such as email, the contents of word processor documents, PDFs, geospatial data, etc., are rapidly becoming a relevant source of [[business intelligence]] for businesses, governments and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wise|first=Lyndsay|title=Data Analysis and Unstructured Data|url=http://www.dashboardinsight.com/articles/business-performance-management/data-analysis-and-unstructured-data.aspx|publisher=Dashboard Insight|accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Britain the discovery that one company was illegally selling fraudulent doctor's notes in order to assist people in defrauding employers and insurance companies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fake doctors' sick notes for Sale for £25, NHS fraud squad warns|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2626120/Fake-doctors-sick-notes-for-sale-on-web-for-25-NHS-fraud-squad-warns.html|publisher=The Telegraph|date=26 August 2008|accessdate=16 September 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an opportunity for insurance firms to increase the vigilance of their unstructured data analysis. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that big data analysis could save the American health care system $300 billion per year and the European public sector €250 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Big Data: The next frontier for innovation, competition and productivity as reported in Building with Big Data|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18741392|accessdate=May 26, 2011 | work=The Economist|date=May 26, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110603031738/http://www.economist.com/node/18741392| archivedate= 3 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These challenges are the current inspiration for much of the innovation in modern analytics information systems, giving birth to relatively new machine analysis concepts such as [[complex event processing]], full text search and analysis, and even new ideas in presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ortega|first=Dan|title=Mobililty: Fueling a Brainier Business Intelligence|url=http://www.itbusinessedge.com/cm/community/features/guestopinions/blog/mobility-fueling-a-brainier-business-intelligence/?cs=47491|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705061921/http://www.itbusinessedge.com/cm/community/features/guestopinions/blog/mobility-fueling-a-brainier-business-intelligence/?cs=47491|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 5, 2011|publisher=IT Business Edge|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such innovation is the introduction of grid-like architecture in machine analysis, allowing increases in the speed of massively parallel processing by distributing the workload to many computers all with equal access to the complete data set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khambadkone |first=Krish |title=Are You Ready for Big Data? |url=http://www.infogain.com/company/perspective-big-data.jsp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314031712/http://www.infogain.com/company/perspective-big-data.jsp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 14, 2011 |publisher=InfoGain |accessdate=February 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analytics is increasingly used in [[education]], particularly at the district and government office levels. However, the complexity of student performance measures presents challenges when educators try to understand and use analytics to discern patterns in student performance, predict graduation likelihood, improve chances of student success, etc. For example, in a study involving districts known for strong data use, 48% of teachers had difficulty posing questions prompted by data, 36% did not comprehend given data, and 52% incorrectly interpreted data.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development (2009). ''Implementing data-informed decision making in schools: Teacher access, supports and use.'' United States Department of Education (ERIC Document Reproduction Service No. ED504191)&lt;/ref&gt; To combat this, some analytics tools for educators adhere to an [[over-the-counter data]] format (embedding labels, supplemental documentation, and a help system, and making key package/display and content decisions) to improve educators’ understanding and use of the analytics being displayed.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, J. (2013, March 28). [https://sas.elluminate.com/site/external/recording/playback/link/table/dropin?sid=2008350&amp;suid=D.4DF60C7117D5A77FE3AED546909ED2 How data Systems &amp; reports can either fight or propagate the data analysis error epidemic, and how educator leaders can help.] ''Presentation conducted from Technology Information Center for Administrative Leadership (TICAL) School Leadership Summit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

One more emerging challenge is dynamic regulatory needs. For example, in the banking industry, Basel III and future capital adequacy needs are likely to make even smaller banks adopt internal risk models. In such cases, cloud computing and open source programming language [[R (programming language)|R]] can help smaller banks to adopt risk analytics and support branch level monitoring by applying predictive analytics.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

== Risks ==
{{original research|date=March 2015}}
The main risk for the people is discrimination like [[price discrimination]] or [[statistical discrimination (economics)|statistical discrimination]].  [https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/review-weapons-of-math-destruction/ See Scientific American book review of "Weapons of math destruction"]

There is also the risk that a developer could profit from the ideas or work done by users, like this example:
Users could write new ideas in a note taking app, which could then be sent as a custom event, and the developers could profit from those ideas. This can happen because the ownership of content is usually unclear in the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10-things/10-reasons-why-i-avoid-social-networking-services/|title=10 reasons why I avoid social networking services|author=Alan Norton|date=9 July 2012|work=TechRepublic|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a user's identity is not protected, there are more risks; for example, the risk that private information about users is made public on the internet.

In the extreme, there is the risk that governments could gather too much private information, now that the governments are giving themselves more powers to access citizens' information. {{Further|Telecommunications data retention}}

'''Belmiro Mendes de Azevedo''' (17 February 1938 – 29 November 2017) was a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[entrepreneur]], ranked by [[Forbes]] as the 605th richest person in the world (2008), as well as the 2nd richest in [[Portugal]], with an estimated wealth of [[United States dollar|US$]] 2 billion. He owned a controlling stake in [[Sonae|Sonae SGPS]], one of the largest business groups in Portugal, which also operates in [[Spain]], [[Greece]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Turkey]] and [[Brazil]].

Sonae is a Portuguese leader in [[real estate]] and [[retail]]ing and also has investments in [[telecommunications]], [[tourism]], [[venture capital]], and the [[Mass media|media]]. In 2006, Sonae launched an unsuccessful hostile bid to control [[Portugal Telecom]] (PT), the number one Portuguese telecommunications operator.

Azevedo, a [[carpenter]] and a [[tailor]]'s son from [[Marco de Canaveses Municipality|Marco de Canaveses]], had a degree in [[chemical engineering]] from the [[University of Porto]] and an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from [[Harvard University]].

Azevedo's shares were acquired to the estate of late banker Afonso Pinto de Magalhães who, through his bank Banco Pinto de Magalhães, fully owned Sonae. Magalhães put Azevedo in charge of Sonae during the turbulent years following the 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]] that culminated in the seizure of the company by the [[Portuguese Government|Government]]. It was the success in keeping the company running during these years, plus the also successful reclaiming of the company ownership, that led the deceased banker's family to cede the control of Sonae to Azevedo, but not before a protracted legal battle between him and the banker's sons, whom Azevedo accused of incompetence and cockiness.&lt;ref&gt;https://dn.sapo.pt/2006/02/27/economia/o_financiamento_imperio_sonae_a_estr.html{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married to Maria Margarida Carvalhais Teixeira and had three children: [[Paulo de Azevedo|Duarte Paulo Teixeira de Azevedo]], born 31 December 1965 and married to Nicole Katharina Gerkrath, his father's successor in the company business, Maria Cláudia Teixeira de Azevedo and Nuno Miguel Teixeira de Azevedo, who also followed his father's footsteps in the family business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geneall.net/P/per_page.php?id=507689 Belmiro de Azevedo in a Portuguese Genealogical site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019124844/http://www.geneall.net/P/per_page.php?id=507689 |date=October 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in the CUF Hospital in [[Porto]], on 29 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observador.pt/2017/11/29/morreu-belmiro-de-azevedo/ |author=Observador |title = Morreu Belmiro de Azevedo |date=2017-11-29 |accessdate=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peterson, G. W., Sampson, J. P., Jr., Reardon, R. C., &amp; Lenz, J. G. (2008). Cognitive information processing model. In F. Leong (Ed.), Encyclopedia of counseling. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt; is a theory of career problem solving and decision making that was developed through the joint efforts of a group of researchers at the [[Florida State University]] Career Center's [http://www.career.fsu.edu/techcenter/ Center for the Study of Technology in Counseling and Career Development]. 

CIP theory asserts that the major components involved in determining career decision-making and problem-solving effectiveness are the content and process of career decisions. The importance of the content and process in career decision making can be described by using a metaphor of a recipe. To make a good dish (decision) one must have all necessary ingredients (content), and know how to follow cooking instructions (process).

==Description==
In terms of career problem solving and decision making, the CONTENT includes everything one must KNOW to make an effective decision, including knowledge about oneself (values, interests, skills, employment preferences), knowledge about options; knowledge about decision-making skills—and knowledge about the thoughts, emotions, and metacognitions (self-talk, self-awareness, monitoring and control) that are involved.  Each of these areas are categorized into domains of information processing, which include the Knowledge Domain (self-knowledge and options knowledge), the Decision-Making Skills Domain, and the Executive Processing Domain (thoughts, emotions, and metacognitions). An analogy of a computer can be used to describe how these domains interact to determine decision-making effectiveness.  The Knowledge Domain is similar to the files of information stored on a computer, the Decision Making Skills domain is similar to a computer's hardware and software that make use of the files in a meaningful way, and the Executive Processing Domain can be likened to a computer's brain or motherboard that dictates the computer's overall functionality. These domains are depicted through a diagram of a [https://web.archive.org/web/20110719194759/http://career.fsu.edu/occupations/careerdecisionindex.cfm pyramid].

The process involves everything one must do to make an effective decision, including: defining the gap between where one is and where one wants to be, gaining a better understanding of oneself and one's options, expanding and narrowing a list of options, valuing and prioritizing remaining options resulting in a first choice, executing the choice by developing a plan of action for implementation, and reflecting back upon the choice. This process can be broken down into five stages ('''C'''ommunication, '''A'''nalysis, '''S'''ynthesis, '''V'''aluing, '''E'''xecution) which form the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110719195031/http://career.fsu.edu/occupations/careerdecisiondecisions.cfm CASVE decision-making cycle] that one continually navigates throughout their career development.

Practical application of CIP theory&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, J. P., Jr., Peterson, G. W., Lenz, J. G., &amp; Reardon, R. C. (1992). A cognitive approach to career services: Translating concepts into practice. Career Development Quarterly, 41, 67-74.&lt;/ref&gt; has evolved since 1971 into a cost-effective, self-directed approach to career service delivery currently in use at the [http://www.career.fsu.edu/ FSU Career Center] and in many other settings both nationally and globally. The CIP approach is intended to translate theory into practice to help individuals make appropriate current career choices, and learn improved problem-solving and decision-making skills needed for future choices.  The CIP approach to career-service delivery includes a number of key elements that can be incorporated by any career center or career-service program as long as certain assumptions are met (multiple staff members, variety of available resources, etc.).

==Key Elements==
The key elements of the CIP approach are broken down into a seven-step service delivery model:

1. Screen individuals for career decision-making readiness before delivering services&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, J. P., Jr., Peterson, G. W., Reardon, R. C., &amp; Lenz, J. G. (2000a). Using readiness assessment to improve career services: A cognitive information processing approach. The Career Development Quarterly, 49, 146-174.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increases the likelihood that the services delivered are congruent with individual needs
* Allows staff to serve more individuals with brief interventions
* Allows more time to deliver intensive interventions to assist individuals with extensive needs
* Helps to understand why individuals are seeking career assistance and judge their decision-making readiness
* If no concrete request for information is made and a potential problems is indicated (indecision, confusion, or disabling emotions), then more comprehensive screening is likely needed

2. Match level of staff assistance to identified individual needs
* Individuals who have a high level of readiness for decision making are referred to self-help career services, where they select, locate, sequence, and use needed resources with little assistance from staff
* Individuals who have a moderate level of readiness for decision making are referred to brief staff-assisted services, where the staff member and client collaboratively plan the use of resources and services necessary to solve the career problem
* Individuals who have a low level of readiness for decision making are ideally referred to individual case-managed services
* The resulting net effect of the CIP approach is to limit expensive services (in terms of staff resources) to individuals with more extensive needs

3. Use career theory to help individuals understand and manage career decision making
* Helps the practitioner decide how much and what type of assistance individuals need to solve career problems
* Helps individuals understand the content and process of career decision making to create a cognitive framework which helps reduce ambiguity, manage information, and provide clear criteria for self-monitoring of progress

4. Use print and online career resources within all levels of service delivery
* Provides individuals with self-help access to resources that meet identified learning needs
* Resources should be used to augment brief staff-assisted and individual case-managed services
* The effectiveness of a career resource room is dependent on having a classification schema and index for organizing and identifying resources, and a comfortable physical space to use resources

5. Use career resources that are appropriate for diverse individual learners
* Resources available in the career resource room should be appropriate for the inherent diversity in individuals’ verbal [[aptitude]], [[motivation]], and [[learning styles]]
* In terms of verbal aptitude, it is particularly important for resources to be available in a wide range of readability
* In terms of motivation and learning style, traditional text-based resources need to be supplemented with video and interactive computer-based resources that may be more reinforcing for some learners
* Care also needs to be taken that individuals’ physical disabilities do not prevent them from accessing resources in career resource rooms, and web sites should be accessible through text readers for persons with visual disabilities

6. Use staff teamwork in delivering services to individuals
* Clients being served with brief staff-assisted services work with a variety of different staff members to solve a career problem.
* Continuity in service delivery resides in the collaboratively developed Individualized Learning Plan (ILP)
* Benefits to the individual include not being restricted to the available appointment times of any one practitioner, and being able to decide how quickly they will use available resources and services
* Staff members must be able to quickly establish helping relationships, clarify client progress in completing the ILP, and subsequently revise the ILP if new needs emerge

7. Provide common staff training for delivering resources and services
* Common training experiences among staff are needed to reduce the likelihood of inconsistent or disjointed service delivery when multiple staff serve one individual
* All staff must be familiar with the theoretical basis of service delivery to help clients understand and manage the career decision-making process
* Staff must be competent in the use of career assessment, intervention planning, information, and instructional resources

==Relationship to Cognitive Therapy==
CIP theory is based on [[cognitive therapy]]&lt;ref&gt;Beck, A. T. (1976). Cognitive therapy and the emotional disorders. NY: International Universities Press.&lt;/ref&gt; concepts developed by [[Aaron Temkin Beck|Aaron Beck]], which specify that dysfunctional cognitions have a detrimental impact on behavior and emotions.  Through cognitive restructuring, collaborative empiricism, attention to emotions, and the development of an effective helping relationship, clients learn to replace dysfunctional cognitions with functional cognitions, resulting in positive changes in behavior and emotions. Dysfunctional cognitions have been determined to interfere with the different components of the CIP approach (self-knowledge, options knowledge, communication, analysis, synthesis, valuing, execution, and executive processing); and the assumptions, attitudes, behaviors, beliefs, feelings, plans, and/or strategies related to career problem solving and decision making must be considered when providing career counseling services.

==Related Assessment Tool==
The Career Thoughts Inventory (CTI)&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, J. P., Jr., Peterson, G. W., Lenz, J. G., Reardon, R. C., &amp; Saunders, D. E. (1996a). Career Thoughts Inventory. Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, J. P., Jr., Peterson, G. W., Lenz, J. G., Reardon, R. C., &amp; Saunders, D. E. (1998). The design and use of a measure of dysfunctional career thoughts among adults, college students, and high school students: The Career Thoughts Inventory. Journal of Career Assessment, 6, 115-134.&lt;/ref&gt; was developed to measure dysfunctional career thoughts, and an accompanying workbook&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, J. P., Jr., Peterson, G. W., Lenz, J. G., Reardon, R. C., &amp; Saunders, D. E. (1996b). Career Thoughts Inventory workbook. Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; (Improving Your Career Thoughts: A Workbook for the Career Thoughts Inventory) was created to help clients restructure and improve their career thinking.  The CTI was developed to integrate the functions of assessment and intervention within a career service delivery context by linking the measure and workbook in such a way that clients can more effectively incorporate the assessment concepts into intervention strategies for change.

The CTI is designed to be used with high school juniors and seniors who may be choosing a post-secondary field of study, choosing an occupation, or seeking employment; college students who may be choosing a major field of study, choosing an occupation, or seeking employment; and adults who are considering an occupational or employment change, seeking employment due to unemployment or underemployment, or reentering the labor market after a substantial period of non-paid work. The readability of the CTI and the CTI Workbook was calculated to be at a 6.4 and 7.7 grade level, respectively.

To facilitate quick completion, scoring, and instrument profiling, and avoid service delivery delays or disruptions, the CTI combines the inventory, answer sheet, and profile form into one booklet.  The Test Booklet can be quickly scored by clients, human service practitioners, or clerical support staff. The CTI Profile is printed on the back page of the booklet.

In service delivery, the CTI can be used by practitioners to help adults, college students, and high school students identify, challenge, and subsequently alter dysfunctional thinking that impairs their ability to effectively solve career problems and make career decisions. Specifically, the CTI can be used as an instrument for screening and needs assessment, as well as a learning resource in delivering career services. The CTI Professional Manual&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, J. P., Jr., Peterson, G. W., Lenz, J. G., Reardon, R. C., &amp; Saunders, D. E. (1996c). Career Thoughts Inventory: Professional manual. Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; provides additional details on the use of the CTI and CTI Workbook, including specific strategies for individual counseling, group counseling, self-directed career decision making, workshops and curricular interventions.

The [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] (internal consistency, stability), [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] (content, construct, convergent), and factor structure of the CTI have been well established. A number of empirical studies have been conducted and have found strong relationships in the expected directions between dysfunctional career thoughts various other constructs (vocational identity, certainty, and knowledge about occupations and training, indecision, neuroticism, vulnerability, angry hostility, self-consciousness, impulsiveness, comfort with choice, lack of information needs, anxiety, depression, self-clarity, decision-making style, cognitive thought patterns, emotional intelligence, symptoms of trauma, self-efficacy, satisfaction with occupational choice, attachment anxiety and avoidance, and others.

The CTI was designed to be quickly administered (most clients complete the 48 CTI items in 7 to 15 minutes) and scored (and scored in 5 to 8 minutes).  As a result, the CTI can be used as part of a brief intake procedure or during an initial session. The CTI Workbook presents interpretive information for all four scales with text, metaphors, and illustrations that practitioners can use to facilitate interpretation of CTI results.  The workbook also has several components that can be assigned as [[Homework in psychotherapy|homework]], such as cognitive restructuring of negative thoughts, developing an individual action plan for using career resources and services, and learning about the decision-making process.  Finally, the CTI Test Booklet and the CTI Workbook are relatively inexpensive to purchase and the hand scoring feature eliminates scoring processing fees.

[[Image:Community Associations Institute logo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Logo of the Community Associations Institute.]]

The '''Community Associations Institute (CAI)''' is an international influential [[Industry trade group|trade association]] and [[advocacy group|special interest group]] headquartered in [[Falls Church, Virginia]], with more than 60 chapters in the United States&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caionline.org/about/who/Pages/ContactCAI.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; that provides "education and resources to the volunteer homeowners who govern community associations", and petitions for legislative and regulatory beneficence for its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Evan| last= McKenzie| title=Privatopia: Homeowner Associations and the Rise of Residential Private Governments| publisher= Yale University Press| isbn= 0-300-06638-4| pages= 119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since CAI was founded in 1973, the people that build and service [[homeowners association#CIDs|common interest developments]] (CIDs) have been a significant force in interest group politics in many states. According to Evan McKenzie they are dominated by lawyers and property managers that have shaped legislative and [[Case law|judicial]] policy making to prevent meaningful regulation of CID activity,&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, ''Privatopia'', 27.&lt;/ref&gt; and keep the discourse on such matters largely private.&lt;ref&gt;''Privatopia'', 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of meaningful legislative regulation or oversight, the idea of residential private government took the shape advocated originally by [[Real-estate developer|developers]] through the [[Urban Land Institute]] and the [[Federal Housing Administration]], and later by lawyers and property managers through CAI.&lt;ref&gt;''Privatopia'', 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''considered purchase''' is a complex buying decision with a high degree of financial and/or emotional risk and reward.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/130774/impulse-vs-considered-purchase-strategy.html&lt;/ref&gt;  This process requires meaningful investigation and comparison by key decision makers and influencers prior to a [[Financial transaction|transaction]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wingmanadv.com/what-motivates-your-consumer-to-make-a-considered-purchase&lt;/ref&gt;  All purchase decisions fall along a spectrum of complexity and consequence depending on the [[Variable (research)|variables]] and relevant information involved.&lt;ref&gt;http://nelsonschmidt.com/considered-purchase-marketing&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike an [[impulse purchase]], a considered purchase typically has a long purchase cycle and significant consequences.  Considered purchase decisions exist in both the consumer and commercial realms involving both products and services.

'''De Tomaso Modena SpA''' was an Italian car-manufacturing company. It was founded by the Argentine-born [[Alejandro de Tomaso]] (1928–2003) in [[Modena]] in 1959. It originally produced various prototypes and racing cars, including a [[Formula One]] car for [[Frank Williams Racing Cars|Frank Williams's team]] in 1970. Most of the funding for the automaker came from de Tomaso's brother-in-law, Armory Haskell Jr, Rowan Industries. In 1971, Ford acquired an 84% stake in De Tomaso from Rowan with Alejandro de Tomaso himself holding the balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/alejandro-de-tomaso-36561.html|title=Alejandro de Tomaso|date=24 May 2003|website=independent.co.uk|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford would sell back their stake in the automaker in 1974 to Alejandro.

== De Tomaso logo ==

The blue and white stripes of the logo's background are the colors of the national flag of Argentina. The symbol in the foreground that looks like a letter "T" is the cattle branding symbol of the Ceballos estate where Alejandro grew up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pantera.infopop.cc/eve|title=De Tomaso Forums|website=pantera.infopop.cc|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company went on to develop and produce both sports cars and luxury vehicles, most notably the Ford-powered Italian-bodied  [[De Tomaso Mangusta|Mangusta]] and [[De Tomaso Pantera|Pantera]] [[gran turismo]]s. From 1976 to 1993 De Tomaso owned Italian sports car maker [[Maserati]], and was responsible for producing cars including the [[Maserati Biturbo|Biturbo]], the [[Maserati Kyalami|Kyalami]], [[Maserati Quattroporte III|Quattroporte III]], [[Maserati Karif|Karif]], and the [[Chrysler TC by Maserati|Chrysler TC]]. De Tomaso also owned motorcycle company [[Moto Guzzi]] from 1973 to 1993.

De Tomaso went into liquidation in 2004,&lt;ref name="italiaspeed.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2004/cars/others/detomaso/liquidation.html |title=News 01.06.2004 |accessdate=20 June 2007 |work=italiaspeed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; although production of new cars continued after this date.&lt;ref name="auto.moldova.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://auto.moldova.org/brands/auto-detomaso-guar-28-54-eng.html |title=News- DeTomaso |accessdate=7 January 2009 |work=auto.moldova.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516180435/http://auto.moldova.org/brands/auto-detomaso-guar-28-54-eng.html |archivedate=16 May 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008 a buyer was being sought for the De Tomaso factory and trademarks, as per the court-appointed liquidators.&lt;ref name="www.detomaso.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detomaso.it/pdf/avviso_gara_marchi_30.5.pdf |title=Avviso di gara per i marchi }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Gian Mario Rossignolo bought the De Tomaso trademark and founded a new company named '''De Tomaso Automobili SpA'''. Rossignolo planned to assemble chassis and bodies in one of [[Delphi Automotive]]'s old production facilities in [[Livorno]] and to fit bodywork, paint and finish its cars in the former [[Pininfarina]] factory in [[Grugliasco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/de-tomaso-revive-pantera|title=De Tomaso to revive Pantera|work=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]|publisher= Haymarket Consumer Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, De Tomaso was again for sale after their business plan failed to gather sufficient financial backing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcarfans.com/112051144253/de-tomaso-up-for-sale---report De Tomaso up for sale - report] WorldCarFans.com, 11 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012,  Rossignolo was arrested following allegations that he misused {{currency|7.5 million|euro}} worth of government funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcarfans.com/112071246240/de-tomaso-chairman-arrested-for-misuse-of-funds De Tomaso chairman arrested for misuse of funds] WorldCarFans.com, 12 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, speculation emerged that [[BMW]] might be interested in the brand factory to produce new BMW models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/bmw-eyes-de-tomaso-brand BMW eyes De Tomaso brand] Autocar, 14 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the original workshop in Modena was in abandonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carbuildindex.com/37828/a-look-inside-the-abandoned-detomaso-factory/ |title=A look inside the abandoned DeTomaso factory |date=12 December 2014 |publisher=The Car Build Index |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227013011/http://www.carbuildindex.com/37828/a-look-inside-the-abandoned-detomaso-factory/ |archivedate=27 February 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015 an Italian bankruptcy court approved the sale of the company to China's Consolidated [[Ideal TeamVenture]], for {{currency|1.05 million|euro}}.&lt;ref name="autoweek.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/de-tomaso-sold-117-million-chinese-buyer-after-deal-fizzles |title=De Tomaso -- the company -- sells for roughly the price of a LaFerrari |work=Autoweek |date=30 April 2015 |accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per that sale report "A lawyer for the buyer announced that Ideal TeamVenture plans to produce cars in China bearing the De Tomaso name."&lt;ref name="autoweek.com"/&gt;

=== Vallelunga ===
De Tomaso's first road-going production model was the [[De Tomaso Vallelunga|Vallelunga]] (named after the [[ACI Vallelunga Circuit|racing circuit]]) introduced in 1963.  This mid-engined sports car had a 104&amp;nbsp;bhp (78&amp;nbsp;kW) [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[Ford Cortina|Cortina]] engine, and reached a top speed of 215&amp;nbsp;km/h (134&amp;nbsp;mph). It had an [[aluminium]] backbone [[chassis]], which was to become a common feature of De Tomaso cars. The first 5 cars were produced in aluminium while production cars had [[fibreglass]] bodywork.

=== Mangusta ===
[[File:DeTomaso Mangusta.jpg|thumb|[[De Tomaso Mangusta]]]]
The [[De Tomaso Mangusta|Mangusta]], introduced in 1966 was the first De Tomaso produced in significant numbers. With the Mangusta, De Tomaso moved from European to American Ford engines.  The car had a 4.7-litre iron-block [[V8 engine|V8]] engine and [[steel]] and aluminium coupé bodywork from [[Ghia]]—an Italian coachbuilder also controlled by [[Alejandro de Tomaso]]. About 400 Mangustas were built before production ended in 1971.

=== Pantera ===
{{main|De Tomaso Pantera}}
[[File:ElvisDeTomaso.jpg|thumb|right|[[De Tomaso Pantera]], once owned by [[Elvis Presley]]]]
The Mangusta was succeeded by the [[De Tomaso Pantera|Pantera]]. It appeared in 1971 with a [[351 Cleveland]] Ford V8 and a low, wedge-shaped body designed by [[Ghia]]'s [[Tom Tjaarda]].&lt;ref name="tom-tjaarda.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tom-tjaarda.net/ |title=Tom Tjaarda |accessdate=20 June 2007 |work=tom-tjaarda.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through an agreement with Ford, De Tomaso sold Panteras in the USA through Ford's [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]] and [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] dealers. Between 1971 and 1973, 6,128 Panteras were produced in [[Modena]], the largest number of a single marque of De Tomaso produced. The [[1973 oil crisis]] and other factors compelled Ford to pull out of the Pantera deal at the end of 1973, a few months after buying all De Tomaso's shares and getting control of the entire production process in the three factories that shared the workload in northern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniele Pozzi|title= De Tomaso - Un argentino nella valle dei motori|language=it|publisher= 24 ORE Cultura|year=2015|pages=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But the Argentinian retained from Ford the right to produce the car for the "rest of the world" market, so he continued Pantera production at a greatly reduced scale of less than 100 cars per year during the 1970s and 1980s. From then on, the cars were largely hand-built, even more than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniele Pozzi|title= De Tomaso - Un argentino nella valle dei motori|language=it|publisher= 24 ORE Cultura|year=2015|pages=163–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incorporating a [[Marcello Gandini]] facelift, suspension redesign, partial chassis redesign and a new, smaller Ford engine, the ''Pantera 90 Si'' model (the ''i'' standing for ''iniezione'' - Italian for ''fuel injection'') was introduced in 1990. There were 41 ''90 Si'' models manufactured with 2 crash tested, 38 sold, and 1 example went directly into a museum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.classicdriver.com/en/article/blue-panther-de-tomaso-pantera-si|title=The Blue Panther - De Tomaso Pantera Si|website=www.classicdriver.com|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the Pantera was finally phased out in 1993 to make way for the radical, [[carbon fibre|carbon-fibre]]-bodied [[De Tomaso Guarà|Guarà]].

=== Guarà ===
The [[De Tomaso Guarà|Guarà]] was De Tomaso's most recent production car, produced beginning in 1993. The Guarà was designed by Carlo Gaino of Synthesis design,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.synthesisdesign.it/guara.html |title=Synthesis design_De Tomaso Guarà |publisher=Synthesisdesign.it |date=2 October 2002 |accessdate=30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; an Italian design house; Gaino also designed the [[Maserati Barchetta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.synthesisdesign.it/barchetta.html |title=Maserati – Barchetta |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a Maserati competition car from 1991, using Ford and [[BMW]] parts in a composite body, the Guarà s available in coupé and barchetta versions. As with all De Tomasos except the Pantera, production has been both limited and sporadic.

=== Biguà and off-road vehicles ===
In the early 2000s two other cars were planned by De Tomaso, but both proved abortive. A two-seat [[Marcello Gandini|Gandini]]-styled convertible, the [[De Tomaso Biguà|Biguà]], was developed from a 1996 [[Salon International de l'Auto|Geneva]] concept in partnership with [[Qvale]], an American firm which had long imported European sports cars into the USA. But as production of the Biguà—renamed the Mangusta—began, the relationship between De Tomaso and Qvale soured; Qvale took over the car and rebadged as the [[Qvale Mangusta]]. Production was short-lived, and Qvale's Italian factory was bought in 2003 by [[MG Rover]] and the Mangusta mechanics used as the basis of the [[MG (car)|MG]] [[MG XPower SV|XPower SV]]. In April 2002, De Tomaso began a project to build off-road vehicles in a new factory in [[Calabria]] in partnership with the Russian company [[UAZ]], but this too foundered. The deal projected a production rate of 10,000 cars a year by 2006: however, no cars were built and De Tomaso went into voluntary liquidation in June 2004. The Guarà remained available in some markets in 2005 and 2006, but it appears that no cars were built after 2004.&lt;ref name="histomobile.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.histomobile.com/1/De_Tomaso/1994/Guara_.htm?lan=1 |title=De Tomaso  Guara |accessdate=20 June 2007 |work=histomobile.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608173312/http://www.histomobile.com/1/De_Tomaso/1994/Guara_.htm?lan=1 |archivedate=8 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== De Tomaso luxury cars ==
Although De Tomaso is principally known as a maker of high-performance sports cars, the firm also produced luxury coupés and saloons in tiny number throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

The 1971 [[De Tomaso Deauville|Deauville]] was an effort to rival contemporary [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]] saloons. With the same engine as the Pantera mounted in the front, the Deauville was clothed in an angular  Tjaarda/[[Ghia]] four-door body. The Deauville did not compete with its rivals, especially those from Germany, on the quality of its build. Despite remaining on De Tomaso's books until 1985, only 244 were ever made. A single example of an estate was built for Alejandro de Tomaso's wife, the American racing driver Isabelle Haskell.

In 1972 De Tomaso introduced a coupé based on the Deauville with a slightly shortened Deauville chassis and the same Ford V8 engine, the [[De Tomaso Longchamp|Longchamp]]. Its body design, however, was substantially different, and influenced by the Lancia Marica prototype, also designed by Tom Tjaarda.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} A total of 409 Longchamps of all variations were built by the time the production ended in 1989.

==Maserati==
With the assistance of the Italian government De Tomaso took over Maserati in 1976 after its owner, Citroën, declared that it would no longer support the loss-making company. The first Maserati De Tomaso introduced, the Kyalami, was a Longchamp redesigned by [[Pietro Frua|Frua]], with the Ford engine replaced by Maserati's own 4.2-litre V8. The Kyalami remained in production until 1983, when it was superseded by the Biturbo, introduced two years earlier.

== Innocenti ==
{{Main|Innocenti}}
In 1976, Innocenti passed to Alejandro de Tomaso and was reorganised by the De Tomaso Group under the name ''Nuova Innocenti''.

From 1976 to 1987 the top of the range Innocenti was the Innocenti Mini de Tomaso, a sport version of the Innocenti Mini developed by De Tomaso, initially equipped with the [[British Leyland|BLMC]] 1275 cc engine, and from 1982 to 1987 with a 1.0-litre 3-cylinder turbocharged [[Daihatsu]] engine.

De Tomaso sold Innocenti to [[Fiat]] in 1993.

== New De Tomaso ==
[[File:De-Tomaso-logo-1.PNG|upright=0.8|thumb|left|De Tomaso Automobili new logo]]
In 2009 the De Tomaso trademark was bought by Gian Mario Rossignolo who founded a new company named '''De Tomaso Automobili SpA'''. A new business plan for the company called for producing three models for a total of 8,000 vehicles: 3,000 crossovers, 3,000 limousines, and 2,000 two-seater sports cars.

=== 2011 De Tomaso Deauville ===
[[File:De Tomaso 2011 schräg.JPG|upright|thumb|right|Deauville Concept at Geneva in 2011]]
At the 2011 [[Geneva Motor Show]], De Tomaso presented a new model.&lt;ref&gt;First commercial brochure with description, technical data and commercial figures at the beginning of 2011 on [http://www.detomaso.it/index.php?page=technical-specification web page www.detomaso.it] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305165439/http://www.detomaso.it/index.php?page=technical-specification |date=5 March 2011 }} (consulted on 2 March 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[De Tomaso Deauville]] was to have been a five-door [[hatchback]]/crossover vehicle with all-wheel drive, which, in the details of its styling, quotes models from [[BMW]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]].&lt;ref&gt;Auto Bild Nr. 8/2011, S. 39 with further data and images&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed range included two gasoline engines with 300 PS and 500 PS as well as a diesel from [[VM Motori]] with 250 PS. The Deauville remained a prototype, as the new company never started production and Rossignolo was arrested in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/12/italy-detomaso-arrest-idUSL6E8IC27120120712 |title=Italian carmaker De Tomaso chairman arrested |publisher=Reuters |date=12 July 2012 |accessdate=23 February 2015 |first=Jennifer |last=Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formula One ==
[[File:De Tomaso Tipo 505.jpg|thumb|right|1970 [[De Tomaso 505/38]]]]
De Tomaso made a handful of [[Formula One]] appearances from 1961 to 1963, with their own chassis and a mix of engines. During 1962 the '''De Tomaso 801''' appeared, with an original 135-degree 1498&amp;nbsp;cc V8 with a claimed {{convert|200|CV|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 9500&amp;nbsp;rpm, and a six-speed De Tomaso transmission (although presumably developed by [[Valerio Colotti]]). The stubby and somewhat unaerodynamic design of the car raised some questions among period writers, as did the claimed max power.&lt;ref name=IMS7862&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Ny Italiensk Formel Racer |trans-title=New Italian Formula Racer | page = 5 | language = Swedish | editor-last = Björklund | editor-first = Bengt | location = Lerum, Sweden | magazine = Illustrerad Motor Sport | number = 7–8 | date = July 1962 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The De Tomaso 801 was entered in a number of races but only appeared once, at the [[1962 Italian Grand Prix]], where it failed to qualify.

De Tomaso then built a Formula One chassis (designed by [[Gian Paolo Dallara]]) for [[Frank Williams Racing Cars]] to use in the [[1970 Formula One season]]. The car was uncompetitive, failing to finish the first four races of the year. In the fifth, the [[1970 Dutch Grand Prix|Dutch Grand Prix]], the [[De Tomaso 505/38]] flipped and caught fire, killing driver [[Piers Courage]]. The team persevered, first with [[Brian Redman]], then [[Tim Schenken]]. However, with no results, the partnership was dissolved at the end of the season.

The '''Council of European Professional and Managerial Staff (''EUROCADRES'')''' is an recognised&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/observatories/eurwork/industrial-relations-dictionary/eurocadres&lt;/ref&gt; cross-industry [[social partner]] in the European [[Social dialogue|Social Dialogue]]&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=329&amp;langId=en&lt;/ref&gt; and in collective bargaining, representing Professional and Managerial Staff (P&amp;MS) in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=2154&amp;langId=en&lt;/ref&gt; 
''EUROCADRES'' is associated to the [[European Trade Union Confederation]] (ETUC), but is fully independent and addresses only Professional and Managerial Staff issues.
At European level ''EUROCADRES'' participates, in association with [[CEC European Managers|CEC - European Managers]], in the cross-industry social dialogue with [[Trade union|workers' representatives]] - [[European Trade Union Confederation|European Trade Union Confederation - ETUC]], and [[Employers' organization|employers' representatives]] -[[BUSINESSEUROPE]], [[CEEP|CEEP - European Centre of Enterprises with Public Participation and of Enterprises of General Economic Interest]], [[UEAPME|UEAPME - European Association of Craft and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises]].&lt;ref&gt;List of consulted cross-industry social partners http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=2154&amp;langId=en&lt;/ref&gt;
With more than 15% of employees holding professional or managerial positions, ''EUROCADRES'' represents&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/REPRESENTATIVENESS.htm&lt;/ref&gt; almost 6 million employees in all sectors of business, in industry as well as in the civil and public services.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurocadres.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

''EUROCADRES'' convenes its Congress, which is the policy-making body, every four years. In the intervening years, affiliates are summoned to a General Assembly. All ''EUROCADRES'' activities and policies between Congresses are controlled by the Executive Committee with national representatives and industry federation delegates including the President and Vice-Presidents elected by a secret ballot of the Congress.
The President (Martin Jefflén, Swedish) represents ''EUROCADRES'' in cooperation with the Vice-Presidents.

The Secretariat is located in Brussels.

== History ==
In 1992, the [[European Union]] entered into a new phase, after the signature of the [[Maastricht treaty]] that opened the way to the [[Euro]] and [[Social partners|recognised the role of social partners]], with the setting up of a framework for [[social dialogue]]. In parallel, the [[trade union movement]] had just marked a new milestone: the seventh ETUC (European trade union confederation) congress in 1991 modernised the structures and opened the door to the [[Trade union federation|European sectoral entities]] as member [[organisations]].

From then on, the European dimension was to play a crucial role.&lt;ref&gt;The legal basis for the consultation of social partners is today embedded in Art 154-155 of the [http://Treaty%20on%20the%20Functioning%20of%20the%20European%20Union TFUE]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} - http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0047:0199:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Professional]] and [[Managerial|managerial staff]], whose numbers were growing, were actively involved in the economic and social life of all [[European countries]]. They were members of many different types of organisation. In the various countries, the professionals' and managers' national organisations, with their work experience within the FIET ([[International Federation of Commercial, Clerical, Professional and Technical Employees]]) Committee for professional and managerial staff, or within NAR (Nordic Professional Council), wanted to be provided with an organisation able to represent them and to act at European level. Thus ''EUROCADRES'' was born, on 24 February 1993 in Luxembourg.

Delegates represented 40 organisations and came from 15 countries. They decided to establish the Council of European Professional and Managerial Staff under the name ''EUROCADRES''. Bertil Blomqvist (Sweden) and Peter Lamb (United Kingdom) were elected Vice Presidents whilst Michel Rousselot (France) was elected President. The action programme adopted by the Assembly covered employment, [[Mobility rights|mobility]], [[training]], the roles of professional and managerial staff, management methods, [[working conditions]] and [[equal opportunities]] and served as the basis for action taken by ''EUROCADRES''. Soon after, ''EUROCADRES'' took the European stage by joining the Europe-wide demonstration organised by the ETUC on 2 April 1993 calling for a coordinated employment policy. In 1999 a joint agreement&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/observatories/eurwork/articles/managerial-and-professional-unions-agree-to-cooperate-in-european-social-dialogue] EurWORK European Observatory of Working Life, Article 27 August 1999: Managerial and professional unions agree to cooperate in European social dialogue&lt;/ref&gt; with [https://www.cec-managers.org/ CEC European Managers] was signed.
In 2013 the Council of European Professional and Managerial Staff is celebrating its 20th Anniversary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1089">'''Extensive stage''', or by its full name, the ''predominantly extensive stage of accumulation'', pertains to one of the [[periodizations of capitalism]], as proposed by Aglietta (1976). It is the first stage of [[capitalism]]. It is also known as the early stage.

During the extensive stage, room exists for the growth of production and capitalist [[means of production]], including [[wages]] and modes of [[employment|labor]]. It is characterized by high rates of [[economic growth]]. When the extensive stage ends, it is followed by the [[intensive stage]] (intensive accumulation).

[[Karl Marx]] described this stage as exhibited in England as "The so-called primitive accumulation".

'''Frederick Estcourt Bucknall''' (6 July 1835 – 4 June 1896) was an English-born publican, brewer and politician in the early days of the colony of [[South Australia]].

==Life==
[[File:Estcourt House, Tennyson.jpg|thumb|Estcourt House, [[Tennyson, South Australia|Tennyson]], built by Bucknall in 1881-3.]]
Bucknall was a member of the Estcourts of [[Shipton Moyne|Estcourt]], an influential old family, in the counties of [[Gloucester]] and [[Wiltshire]], but born in London, where his father, William Bucknall of [[Crutched Friars]], was Commodore of the [[Royal Thames Yacht Club]].&lt;ref name=SAR&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article53688178 |title=The Late Mr. F. E. Bucknall |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=5 June 1896 |accessdate=10 February 2013 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after he arrived in South Australia around 1860&lt;ref name=SAR/&gt; via [[Melbourne]], the original [[River Torrens#Torrens_Lake|Torrens Dam]] was nearly completed, and he built a fleet of fine pleasure craft which he placed on the lake for hire, but the dam failed and was washed away, putting paid to his enterprise. He built a boatshed on the [[Port River]] to the south-east of where the Jervois Street bridge was later built, and created a great deal of interest in [[sculling]] on the Port River. He gained approval as a Licensed Victualler and built the South Australian Club Hotel in St Vincent Street, [[Port Adelaide]] near the site of his boatshed.&lt;ref name=SAR/&gt; He married the widow of Mr. Henry Haussen, a proprietor of the [[Hindmarsh Brewery]].&lt;ref name=late&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article34549091 |title=The Late Mr. F. E. Bucknall |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=5 June 1896 |accessdate=10 February 2013 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878 Bucknall and [[Arthur Harvey (Australian politician)|Arthur Harvey]] (later to be his parliamentary colleague) formed the Grange Land and Investment Company, to develop the suburb of [[Grange, South Australia|The Grange]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charlessturt.sa.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/Local_history_factsheet_-_Grange.pdf Charles Sturt Council: ''A brief history of the suburb Grange''&lt;/ref&gt;

The business prospered and he became a wealthy man, in 1883 building a magnificent mansion "Estcourt House" on the seafront between The Grange and [[Glanville, South Australia|Glanville]]. He and Mrs. Bucknall went on a visit to England. While they were away the land boom turned to bust, and with the failure of the [[Commercial Bank of South Australia]] in 1886, he lost much of his fortune&lt;ref name=late/&gt; and was forced to relinquish his mansion to the [[AMP Society]] and find employment in the office of E. Benda and Co. of [[Grenfell Street, Adelaide|Grenfell Street]].&lt;ref name=late/&gt;

Bucknall died at his residence in Childers Street, [[North Adelaide]].

===Politics===
Bucknall entered Parliament as a member for [[Electoral district of West Torrens|West Torrens]] on 8 April 1881&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SA-parl |pid=3659 |name=Frederick Estcourt Bucknall}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a colleague of [[W. H. Bean]], and was elected for another three years in 1884 with Arthur Harvey ( – 25 January 1902) with a break 1885–1886 while he visited England for his health.&lt;ref name=SAR/&gt;

Bucknall was a supporter of projects to build the [[Outer Harbor, South Australia|Outer Harbor]] and the [[Central Australia Railway|North–South Railway]], but for some he was remembered as having instituted mandatory [[horse trough]]s outside licensed premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58840791 |title=Early Breweries. |newspaper=[[The Mail (Adelaide)|The Mail]] |location=Adelaide |date=27 November 1926 |accessdate=12 February 2013 |page=17 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civic life===
Bucknall was Mayor of [[City of Charles Sturt|Hindmarsh]] in 1881, 1882 and 1883, a position he filled with distinction.

==Other interests==
In his youth he was a boxer, athlete and president of the Hindmarsh Cricket Club, of which he was patron for over ten years prior to his death.&lt;ref name=late/&gt;

He was an enthusiastic rower, swimmer and yachtsman. He went in for boatbuilding, and owned the yachts ''Brilliant'', ''Rosa'' and ''Enchantress'', which he bought from Sir [[Thomas Elder]] (and eventually sold to Mr. Cunningham).

He was for some time secretary of the Licensed Victuallers' Association, and president for six years. He was made a life member in recognition of this service.

He was an excellent musician, and was at one time organist of the South Australian Grand Lodge of Freemasons, of which he was a member.&lt;ref name=SAR/&gt;

== Charitable work ==
In 1995, Blutrich founded the organisation Atid Varod (Hebrew: עתיד ורוד) "Brighter Future" which is a billboard advertising [[social business]] in his previous hometown of Ra’anana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/homes/2011/08/26/builder_offers_youth_a_bright_future.html|title=Builder offers youth a bright future {{!}} Toronto Star|website=thestar.com|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project brought together business and social responsibility by employing at-risk youth outside the formal school system (age 16-18) who are trained in marketing, sales, and consulting to ensure both a successful company and long term benefit for its employees. The municipality of Ra’anana granted the organisation a franchise of 200 billboards on the main thoroughfares in the city to support the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://varod.signs.org.il/|title=עתיד ורוד|website=varod.signs.org.il|language=he|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Atid Varod has spread throughout Israel.

Blutrich was the founder and first Chairman of the Israeli Forum in 2005, a Toronto-based Israeli-expat community that attempts to deepen the links between Israeli and North American Jews, as well as Canadian society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cjnews.com/news/federation-body-aims-integrate-israelis|title=Federation body aims to integrate Israelis - The Canadian Jewish News|last=Reporter|first=Sheri Shefa, Staff|date=2008-12-18|work=The Canadian Jewish News|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Forum includes various wings including the Canada-Israel Chamber of Commerce, Hamifgash (an Israeli cultural organisation), and Kachol Lavan (an Israeli-education school system for expats). In 2008, thousands of other organisations joined the Forum to create one of the strongest non-religious connective organisation between Israelis and the Jewish diaspora.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cjnews.com/news/toronto-israelis-unite-single-organization|title=Toronto Israelis unite in single organization - The Canadian Jewish News|last=Gordon|first=Dave|date=2008-06-04|work=The Canadian Jewish News|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prioritising social responsibility in business, Blutrich has also connected Skyline to other charities including Trees Ontario, Clean the World, and [[Make-A-Wish Foundation|Make-a-Wish Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hoteliermagazine.com/2013-hotel-regional-company-of-the-year-skyline-hotels-and-resorts/|title=2013 Hotel Regional Company of the Year: Skyline Hotels and Resorts - Hotelier Magazine|date=2013-12-09|work=Hotelier Magazine|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blutrich was the Director of "Ve'ahavta" in Toronto, a non-profit organisation focused on fighting homelessness in Toronto and other humanitarian issues around the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In support of the arts, Blutrich was also a Director at the [[ReelWorld Film Festival]], a festival promoting diversity in the Canadian arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bigpictureconferences.ca/PreviousConferences/CHIC/2010/index6e52.html?pagePath=Speakers/Gil_Blutrich&amp;id=21759|title=Hotel Invest {{!}} Gil Blutrich|website=www.bigpictureconferences.ca|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeux du Commerce West''', '''JDC West Business Competition''' or informally, '''JDC West''' is an annual business competition featuring top business schools and students from across [[Western Canada]], as well as the largest undergraduate business competition in Western Canada.  The first competition, hosted by UBC, occurred January 20-23, 2006, and attracted over 400 students. JDC West was modeled after [[:fr:Jeux du Commerce|Jeux du Commerce]] and allows the competition to move from host university/city to host university/city each given year.  

==Structure==

Each university sends one team of 50+ representative students to participate respectively in one of 10 Academic Competitions, 1 Parliamentary Debate, 1 Athletic Competition or 1 Social Competition.  Points are awarded and accumulated towards a team being declared "School of the Year".

===Academics===

There are 10 core Academic Competitions. That being said, an organizing committee may add any number of additional academic cases, providing that the core academic cases (listed below) are included.  Each competition has 3 students from each team participate. In each case competition participants have a fixed amount of time to review the facts and prepare before presenting to the industry judges and experts. 

Current academic events for JDC West are:
* [[Accounting]]
* [[Business Strategy]]
* [[Entrepreneurship]] 
* [[Finance]] 
* [[Human Resource Management]] 
* [[International Business]]
* [[Business Technology Management]] 
* [[Marketing]]
* [[Not-for-profit Business Strategy]] (added in 2009)
* [[Taxation]] (removed for 2019)
* Operations Management (added for 2019)

===Debate===

Each debate team has 4 students.  They have 30 minutes to review the proposal before presenting.  As it is in [[Parliamentary Debate|parliamentary style]], one team is designated ''Team Government'' and the other ''Team Opposition''.

===Athletics===

The hosting school chooses the sport each year. The teams include both male and female competitors. 

*2006: Indoor Soccer (Futsol)
*2007: Handball
*2008: Dodgeball
*2009: Volleyball, Westcoast Kickball, Inner-tube Water Polo, Relay (6 X 200)
*2010: Indoor Soccer played on two 190 x 90’ fields on FIFA sanctioned Polytan artificial turf.
*2011: Inner-Tube Water Basketball &amp; Ultimate Frisbee

*2017: Korfball &amp; DBL Ball
*2018: [[Quidditch]] &amp; [[Tchoukball]]
*2019: Tsegball &amp; D-Hoops

===Social===

Each social team has 4 students - two males and two females. The social portion of the JDC West competition is arguably the most arduous on its competitors who are on-call for ten social challenges to be completed in less than 48 hours at any time of day or night. These entertaining challenges are known to include spirit, mental and physical challenges that bring the 4 students together in a way no team sport could. These challenges test students adaptability, enthusiasm and team work to the extreme.

===Additional awards===

Participation - Focuses on the spirit of each school during the competition weekend. The team that cheers the hardest, shows up for the most events, and is the life of the party takes the prize.

Charity - Has two awards. One for the number of hours that school commits to their charities of choice and the second for the amount of dollars raised for their charity of choice.

==History of the Games==
===History of JDC and JDC West===   
The original '''[[:fr:Jeux du Commerce|Jeux du Commerce]]''', French for "Commerce Games" started as a Business Student Competition in 1989 in [[Eastern Canada]]. They were created in 1988 thanks to the initiative of some students of HEC MONTREAL who wanted to strengthen the links between the students of business administration through the province of Quebec. Mister Patrice Bourbonnais was the student heading a team of co-founders, including Patrick Bérard and Benoît Lessard, as well as others students. The School of Hautes Etudes Commerciales (French business school) of Montreal was the first institution host of the Games (Sets) of the Business in January, 1989.  [[:fr:Jeux du Commerce|Jeux du Commerce]] grew throughout the years and became one of the largest events hosted by [[:fr:regroupement étudiant des facultés d'administration de l'Est du Canada (RÉFAEC)|REFAEC]].  In 2003, Yannick Denis-Trudel, the president of [[:fr:regroupement étudiant des facultés d'administration de l'Est du Canada (RÉFAEC)|REFAEC]] at the time had a vision to expand "the games" to the rest of Canada.  In an attempt to unify the country under the [[:fr:Jeux du Commerce|Jeux du Commerce]] banner, he took on the task of inviting a group of delegates from across Canada to visit the games and see what they were all about.  Students returned to their schools excited, but lacked a bit of direction in terms of establishing the games in their own regions.  The year after, Yannick made another attempt to get the rest of Canada excited about the games and created a competing team called "Team Rest of Canada" or "Team ROC".  The intention was to allow those visiting the games to actively take part in the games, rather than just watch from the sidelines.  Student's went back to their respective schools with an excitement to bring [[:fr:Jeux du Commerce|Jeux du Commerce]] to their respective regions.  At Roundtable 2005, one bid to host the event in the Western Region by students from the Sauder School of Business at the University of British Columbia, Co-Led by Jeff Potter and Nik Laufer-Edel.  Another bid was put forth for the Ontario region by Guelph Humber.  The Western bid was approved by the presidents of the western business schools of the Canadian Business School Council and allowed JDC West to take its first steps to be actualized.

In 2006, over 1,200 business students from 13 Eastern universities in Canada chose to compete. Since its inauguration, the JDC has become a prestigious annual event noted for its academic excellence and superior teamwork development.  Like JDC West, JDC consists of Athletic, Social, Debate and community involvement components. 

The JDC legacy expanded to Ontario schools in 2009, in a competition branded as JDC Central.
    
Following the success of '[[:fr:Jeux du Commerce|Jeux du Commerce]]' a desire was expressed to create similar games in Western Canada, ultimately leading to a Commerce Competition on a national scale.  The Western Games were dubbed ''JDC West''. JDC West has exemplified professionalism and excellence, while focusing on the unique challenges facing a Western Canadian business student.  The academic structure of the competition is maintained, encouraging students to strive for excellence and professionalism, while continuing the goodwill and good sportsmanship that JDC has been known for.

The JDC West Business Competition was incorporated as a not-for-profit in 2010 prior to JDC West 2011. In 2011, a volunteer Board of Directors was voted in by the Presidents of the participating business schools' students societies in collaboration with their JDC West Team Captains. This board is composed of active JDC West alumni and the current Organizing Committee's External Co-Chair. The board's main roles are to oversee the long-term strategy, risk mitigation, relationship management and high level financial health of the competition to ensure its long-term sustainability.

[[File:Rheinpark-Köln-OSM.png|thumb|Map of the Cologne trade fair grounds (marked ''Messegelände'')]]
'''Koelnmesse GmbH''' (''Cologne Trade Fair'') is an international trade fair and exhibition center located in [[Cologne]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]]. With around 80 [[trade fair]]s and over 2,000 [[Business conference|conferences]] annually, Koelnmesse is one of the country's largest trade fair organisers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koelnmesse.com/en/messenundveranstaltungen/messenveranstaltungen_1.php Koelnmesse.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and with 284,000 m² exhibition floor area the third largest by area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auma.de/de/messemarkt/branchenkennzahlen/internationalemessen/seiten/hallenkapazitaeten.aspx Hall capacities by AUMA e. V.] Hall capacities by AUMA e. V.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cologne Trade Fair ground was founded in 1922. Until 2005, the trade fair was based in the historic Rheinhallen, and since then moved into new premises next to them. The old [[Fair Tower Cologne]] (''Messeturm Köln'') is a landmark building from 1928 and features a tower restaurant on the top floor.

Since 2018, the fair has been undergoing the greatest renovation works in its history. They are expected to last until 2030 and cost €600 million. Two thirds of that amount will be spent renovating the seven southern halls, dating from the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rundschau-online.de/region/koeln/sanierung-vor-gamescom-die-koelnmesse-modernisiert-sieben-suedhallen-30629372# |publisher=Kölnische Rundschau |title= Die Kölnmesse modernisiert sieben Südhallen| date= 15 June 2018 |language=German |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mauro Moretti''' (born 29 October 1953) is an Italian executive and former [[CEO]] and General Manager of [[Leonardo S.p.A.]] (formerly Finmeccanica&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ansa News|title=Finmeccanica meeting approves new name, 'Leonardo'|url=http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2016/04/28/-finmeccanica-meeting-approves-new-name-leonardo-_995b8ba5-2ad1-4a79-b9d4-13c8c04becd3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;), from  May 2014 to May 2017.

He is also President of ASD – the AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (since March 2015), Chairman of the Italy-Japan Business Group (since September 2015), Honorary Chairman of AIAD – the Italian Industries Federation for Aerospace, [[Defense (military)|Defence]] and Security (since July 2014) and President of the Italian [[Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane|FS Italian]] Foundation (since 2013). 

He has been CEO of [[Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane]] and chairman of the [[Community of European Railway and Infrastructure Companies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cer.be/about-us/how-we-work/chairman Organigramma CER CER]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uic.org/spip.php?article2015 UIC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112051535/http://www.uic.org/spip.php?article2015 |date=12 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Mompeo]]  mayor in 2004 and he worked as syndacalist.

==Biography==
Mauro Moretti joined Ferrovie dello Stato a few months after graduating in Electro Technical Engineering at [[Bologna University]].
His career continued in FS where, after passing a public examination, he reached an executive position. Since then, he has held numerous positions in various sectors and with various companies of the Group. Moretti has been Vice-Director of the Technologies and System Development Division (December 1991), Director of the Technological Development and Rolling Stock Division (March 1993), Managing Director of Metropolis, the Group company for the management, development of real estate assets (February 1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eva Böckle|url=http://www.cer.be/press/press-releases/1828-mauro-moretti-becomes-new-cer-chairman |title=CER: Curriculum of Mauro Moretti |publisher=Cer.be |date=21 January 2009|accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1997 Moretti became the director of "Area Strategica di Affari" (ASA)- Business Strategies, which he managed even after it was transformed into the Infrastructure Division (July 1999). In February 2001 Moretti became a Member of the Board of Directors of Ferrovie dello Stato. In July of the same year, [[Rete Ferroviaria Italiana]] was set up and he was appointed [[Managing Director]]. During his time in FS he also became a cadre of the trade union CGIL Trasporti, arriving to be its Secretary from 1986 to 1991.

In September 2006 he was appointed [[Chief Executive Officer]] of [[Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane]] Spa. 

In May 2014 Finmeccanica ([[Leonardo]] since 1 January 2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leonardo: articles of association|url=http://www.leonardocompany.com/en/-/statuto-sociale-articles-association|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Board of Directors appointed Mauro Moretti as new Chief Executive Officer and General Manager of the Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4-traders.com/FINMECCANICA-SPA-162001/news/Finmeccanica--Board-of-Directors-appoints-Mauro-Moretti-Chief-Executive-Officer-and-General-Manager-18449746/ Finmeccanica: Board of Directors appoints Mauro Moretti Chief Executive Officer and General Manager]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Moretti has launched the company’s reorganisation plan for its competitiveness in global markets. The plan’s objective was to transform the company into a more integrated industrial hub, structured in seven operational divisions. The company’s activities have been focused on the core business of Aerospace, Defence and Security and non-strategic assets, such as the Transport sector, have been sold off. At the same time, Moretti has implemented plans for debt and cost reduction and profitability recovery. In 2016, Moretti also proposed to change the company name from Finmeccanica to Leonardo SpA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Official Press Release|title=FINMECCANICA: SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING APPROVES THE CHANGE OF THE COMPANY'S NAME AND THE 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS|url=http://www.leonardocompany.com/en/-/cs-28042016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a name inspired by the Italian scientist [[Leonardo Da Vinci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reuters|title=Finmeccanica calls on 'Leonardo' to mark turnaround|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-finmeccanica-results-idUSKCN0WI2SN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 January 2017, Moretti was convicted by an Italian court for his alleged role in a train crash in 2009, in which a freight train carrying liquefied gas [[Viareggio train derailment|derailed and caught fire]] at the Italian town of Viareggio, killing 32 people. Moretti received a seven-year jail sentence, but several levels of appeal may take years to resolve the conviction during which time Moretti will be free. His company has said he retains his current role during this legal process.&lt;ref name=""&gt;[http://www.defensenews.com/articles/leonardo-ceo-backed-by-board-after-rail-crash-conviction Leonardo CEO Backed by Board After Rail Crash Conviction], Tom Kington, DefenseNews.com, 2017-01-31&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohammed Mohiedin Anis''' (born 1946/47), also known as '''Abu Omar''', is a Syrian businessman and car collector, based in [[Aleppo]]. A March 2017 photograph of him sitting on his bed, smoking a pipe and listening to his wind-up record player in a rubble-strewn room has been widely reproduced.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4701247/aleppo-syria-car-collector/ |author=Katz, Andrew|title=The Man on the Bed |website=Time.com |date=14 March 2017 |accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Anis studied medicine in [[Zaragoza]], Spain, in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Selk |first=Avi |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/14/how-one-mans-pause-became-a-haunting-symbol-of-aleppos-destruction/ |title=How one man’s pause became a haunting symbol of Aleppo’s destruction |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=14 March 2017 |accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DiarioMotor"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Álvarez|first1=Sergio|title=A pesar de la destrucción del conflicto, este coleccionista de clásicos de Alepo no ha perdido su pasión|url=http://www.diariomotor.com/noticia/coches-clasicos-siria/|accessdate=15 March 2017|work=DiarioMotor|date=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a wealthy textile dye entrepreneur.&lt;ref name=laalo&gt;[http://laalo.net/aleppo-car-lover-aims-to-revive-his-wounded-classics-world/ "Aleppo automotive lover goals to revive his ´wounded´ classics | World"], Laalo.net.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In the 1970s, he was employed in Italy translating [[Fiat]] car manuals into Arabic.&lt;ref name="jalopnik1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiarioMotor" /&gt;  Later he went back to Syria and opened a cosmetics factory called "Mila Robinson".&lt;ref name="jalopnik1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiarioMotor" /&gt;&lt;ref name=laalo /&gt;

==Car collection==
Anis states that his fascination with classic cars goes back to the 1950 Pontiac that his father drove, and which Anis still owns.&lt;ref name="jalopnik1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/syrian-car-enthusiasts-30-car-collection-destroyed-in-c-1793278047 |author=
Westbrook, Justin T.| title=Syrian Enthusiast's 30-Car Collection Destroyed In Civil War |website=Jalopnik.com |date=14 March 2017|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first purchase was a 1947 Plymouth.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; His collection now includes dozens of cars from the 1940s and 1950s, and prior to the [[Syrian Civil War]], he had hoped to open a museum in Syria.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; His favourite among his collection is a 1947 Cadillac convertible, now badly damaged, that he bought in a 2005 auction.&lt;ref name="jalopnik1"/&gt; He maintains that "no car collection is complete without at least one Cadillac",&lt;ref name="jalopnik1"/&gt; and his collection also includes a [[VW Thing]], a 1955 [[Buick Super]], a 1949 [[Hudson Commodore]], a 1957 [[Mercury Montclair]], a 1958 [[Chevrolet Apache]], a cargo-van bodied [[Citroen 2CV]], a 1947 Plymouth, as well as other vintage Buicks and Cadillacs.&lt;ref name="jalopnik1"/&gt;

Anis's collection of classic cars reached some 30 vehicles, but has slowly dwindled during the war.&lt;ref name="independentcivil"&gt;{{cite news|author=McKernan, Bethan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/aleppo-viral-photograph-old-man-story-behind-syria-civil-war-six-years-mohammed-moheidin-anis-abu-a7630691.html |title=Aleppo man: The story behind the viral photograph symbolising six years of Syrian civil war |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=15 March 2017|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, he had 24 vintage cars, having lost six to shelling.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-35387895 |title=Syrian vintage car collector Abu Omar defies shelling – BBC News |website=Bbc.co.uk |date=23 January 2017 |accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent theft of the cars, he removes the steering wheels and seats. During the conflict, his neighbours stopped rebels who wanted to mount an anti-aircraft gun on a 1958 Chevrolet.&lt;ref name="jalopnik1"/&gt;

He had to leave Aleppo for a time at the height of the [[Battle of Aleppo (2012–16)|Battle of Aleppo]], and when he returned only 13 cars were left (including his 1947 Cadillac convertible, now badly damaged), seven having been impounded by the Syrian police, and 10 either missing or destroyed in the war.&lt;ref name="jalopnik1"/&gt; In March 2017, Anis estimated that altogether, one-third of the collection had been either destroyed or stolen.&lt;ref name="independentcivil"/&gt; He says, "When one of my cars is hit, it's as if I or one of my relatives has been hit. It's as if they were my children, so I come down to check on them".&lt;ref name="jalopnik1" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Anis lives alone in the formerly rebel-held neighbourhood of al-Shaar in [[Aleppo]], his family having fled due to the war.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; He has eight children with two wives, one in Aleppo, the other in [[Hama]], and would like to leave his cars to his children, two to every boy, one to every girl.&lt;ref name="jalopnik1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=laalo /&gt; He speaks five languages, and likes to smoke a pipe while listening to classical music, and to Syrian singers such as [[Mohamed Dia al-Din]].&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independentcivil"/&gt;

'''Thaksin Shinawatra''' ({{lang-th|ทักษิณ ชินวัตร}}; {{RTGS|''Thaksin Chinnawat''}}; {{IPA-th|tʰák.sǐn t͡ɕʰīn.nā.wát|pron}}; born 26 July 1949) is a [[Thailand|Thai]] and [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] businessman, politician and visiting professor who was the [[List of Prime Ministers of Thailand|Prime Minister of Thailand]] from 2001 to 2006 and [[Royal Thai Police|Thai Police]] from 1973 to 1987. 

The former police officer founded the mobile phone operator [[Advanced Info Service]] and the IT and telecommunications conglomerate [[Shin Corporation]] in 1987, that made him one of the richest people in Thailand. He joined politics in 1994, founded the [[Thai Rak Thai Party]] (TRT) in 1998 and, after a landslide electoral victory, became prime minister in 2001.

Thaksin's government launched programs to reduce poverty, expand infrastructure, promote small and medium-sized enterprises, and universal healthcare coverage. Thaksin declared a "war on drugs" in which more than 2,500 people died and took a strong-arm approach against the [[South Thailand insurgency|separatist insurgency in the Muslim southern provinces]]. He was the first democratically elected prime minister of Thailand to serve a full term and was re-elected in 2005 by an overwhelming majority.

After selling shares of his corporation worth more than a billion dollars to foreign investors without paying taxes, considerable criticism resulted. A citizens' movement against Thaksin, called [[People's Alliance for Democracy]] or "yellow shirts", launched mass protests, accusing him of corruption, abuse of power and autocratic tendencies. Thaksin called snap elections that were boycotted by the opposition and invalidated by the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]].

He was [[Deposition (politics)|overthrown]] in a [[2006 Thai coup d'état|military coup on 19 September 2006]]. His party was outlawed and he was barred from political activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thaksin Shinawatra: from billionaire to fugitive ex-prime minister|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= 26 February 2010 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2010/feb/26/thailand?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487#/?picture=359796750&amp;index=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin has since lived in self-imposed exile except for a brief visit to Thailand in 2008. He was sentenced ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' to two years in jail for abuse of power. From abroad he has continued to influence Thai politics, through the [[People's Power Party (Thailand)|People's Power Party]] that ruled in 2008, and its successor organisation [[Pheu Thai Party]], as well as the [[United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship]] or "red shirt" movement. His younger sister [[Yingluck Shinawatra]] was the prime minister of Thailand from 2011 to 2014.

In 2009, Thaksin said in an interview that he was living in Dubai and still had access to about $100 million of his money.

==Heritage and early life==
Thaksin's great-grandfather, [[Seng Saekhu]], was an immigrant from [[Meizhou]], [[Guangdong]], China, who arrived in Siam in the 1860s and settled in [[Chiang Mai]] in 1908. His eldest son, Chiang Saekhu, was born in [[Chanthaburi]] in 1890 and married a Thai woman named Saeng Samana. Chiang's eldest son, Sak, adopted the Thai surname Shinawatra ("routinely appropriate action") in 1938 because of the country's anti-Chinese movement, and the rest of the family also adopted it.&lt;ref name="familytree"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2011/08/08/the-shinawatra-family-tree/|title=The Shinawatra family tree|work=New Mandala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seng Saekhu had made his fortune through [[Farm (revenue leasing)|tax farming]]. Chiang Saekhu/Shinawatra later founded Shinawatra Silks and then moved into finance, construction, and property development. Thaksin's father, Loet, was born in Chiang Mai in 1919 and married Yindi Ramingwong. Yindi's father, Charoen Ramingwong (born: Wang Chuan Cheng), was a [[Hakka people|Hakka]] immigrant&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://shanghaiist.com/2014/11/01/yingluckthaksin_go_on_a_family_trip.php |title=Former Thai leaders Yingluck, Thaksin visit ancestral village in Meizhou, Guangdong

In 1968, Loet Shinawatra entered politics and became an MP for Chiang Mai and deputy leader of the now-defunct Liberal Party. Loet Shinawatra quit politics in 1976. He opened a coffee shop, grew oranges and flowers in Chiang Mai's San Kamphaeng district, and opened two cinemas, a gas station, and a car and motorcycle dealership. By the time Thaksin was born, the Shinawatra family was one of the richest and most influential families in Chiang Mai.&lt;ref name="familytree"/&gt;

Thaksin was born in [[Amphoe San Kamphaeng|San Kamphaeng]], Chiang Mai province. He is [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]]. He lived in the village of San Kamphaeng until he was 15, then moved to Chiang Mai city to study at [[Montfort College]]. At 16, he helped run one of his father's cinemas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3700199.stm BBC News, Billionaire hopes to score Liverpool deal] BBC News, 18 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin married [[Potjaman Shinawatra|Potjaman Damapong]] in July 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Pasuk Phongpaichit (2009), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; They have one son, [[Panthongtae Shinawatra|Panthongtae]] and two daughters, Pintongtha and Peathongtarn. They divorced in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hP1oYydxL4F7Gt2NLyhoiQVHE_eQ |title=Thailand's deposed PM Thaksin divorces wife: spokesman |accessdate=16 November 2008 |agency=AFP |date=16 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin's youngest sister, [[Yingluck Shinawatra]], is said to have entered politics in 2011 at her brother's request as leader of the pro-Thaksin [[Pheu Thai Party]] and was elected prime minister on 3 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://graphicsweb.wsj.com/documents/CAROUSEL2013/?standalone=1&amp;slug=THAILAND1126 |title=Turmoil in Thailand: Key Players - WSJ.com |accessdate=11 May 2014 |agency=WSG |date=11 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512225851/http://graphicsweb.wsj.com/documents/CAROUSEL2013/?standalone=1&amp;slug=THAILAND1126 |archivedate=12 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin earned a [[doctorate]] in criminology at [[Sam Houston State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shsu.edu/~pin_www/T@S/2001/ShinawatraFeature.html|title=(Archived) Shinawatra Feature|first=Sam Houston State University, SHSU,|last=753|date=|website=www.shsu.edu|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin Shinawatra is a former [[university lecturer]] at [http://sh.mahidol.ac.th/?lang=en Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities] of [[Mahidol University]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tdw.polsci.chula.ac.th/?q=event/2010/02/26/%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A9%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%93-%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%A3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police career==
&lt;!-- DO NOT ADD PREFIX MR. HERE. IT IS NOT NEEDED FOR WIKIPEDIA --&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra was a member of the 10th class of the Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School,&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, Thaksin's classmates closed ranks behind him on his 58th birthday, 27 July 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and was then admitted to the Thai Police Cadet Academy. Graduating in 1973, he joined the [[Royal Thai Police]]. He received a master's degree in Criminal Justice from [[Eastern Kentucky University]] in the United States in 1975, and three years later was awarded a [[doctorate]] in criminal justice at [[Sam Houston State University]] in [[Huntsville, Texas]]. Returning to Thailand, he reached the position of Deputy Superintendent of the Policy and Planning Sub-division, General Staff Division, Metropolitan Police Bureau, before resigning his commission in 1987 as a [[Police rank|Police Lieutenant Colonel]] and leaving the police. His former wife, [[Potjaman Shinawatra|Potjaman Damapong]], is the daughter of a Police General Priewpan Damapong and now uses her mother's maiden name.&lt;ref&gt;Pasuk Phongpaichit (2009), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; He is a former [[university lecturer]] at [[Royal Thai Police|Royal Police Cadet Academy]] in 1975-1976.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neutron.rmutphysics.com/teaching-glossary/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=9076&amp;Itemid=26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://hilight.kapook.com/view/46634&lt;/ref&gt;
Thaksin Shinawatra was revoked his Police Lieutenant Colonel rank on September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2558/E/207/1.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/679772/prayut-signs-order-revoking-thaksin-police-rank&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==

===Early ventures===
Thaksin and his wife began several businesses while he was still in the police, including a silk shop, a cinema, and an apartment building. All were failures and left him over 50 million baht in debt. In 1982, he established ICSI. Using his police contacts, he leased computers to government agencies with modest success. However, later ventures in security systems (SOS) and public bus radio services (Bus Sound) all failed.&lt;ref name="TranscriptInterview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tri333.exteen.com/ |title=Transcript of an interview between Thaksin Shinawatra and Cheeptham Khamwisit (Thai: ชีพธรรม คำวิเศษณ์) on the Thaiventure.com program on FM 102 radio station |publisher=Tri333.exteen.com |accessdate=19 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503214920/http://tri333.exteen.com/ |archive-date=3 May 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaksin.net/life.html Personal background from personal website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419102042/http://www.thaksin.net/life.html |date=19 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1986, he founded [[Advanced Info Service]] (AIS), which started off as a computer rental business.&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jobtopgun.com/profile/searchprofile?id_emp=255 |title=Google Cache of a JobTopGun profile of AIS's corporate milestones |publisher=webcache.googleusercontent.com |accessdate=19 February 2010 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 Thaksin resigned from the police. He then marketed a romance drama called ''Baan Sai Thong'', which became a popular success in theatres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thaksin Shinawatra-a biography |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/election2001/thaksinprofile.html |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=August 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=2&amp;id=60278&amp;usrsess= |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |title=Thai govt pins border hopes on soaps |date=25 May 2002 |access-date=5 October 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051111093614/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=2&amp;id=60278&amp;usrsess= |archive-date=11 November 2005 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, he joined [[Pacific Telesis]] to operate and market the PacLink [[pager]] service, a modest success, though Thaksin later sold his shares to establish his own paging company.&lt;ref name="TranscriptInterview" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3700199.stm Billionaire hopes to score Liverpool deal] 18 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1989, he launched IBC, a cable television company. At that time, Thaksin had a very good relationship with Chalerm Yoobumrung, the minister of the Prime Minister's Office, who was in charge of Thai press and media. It is a question whether Chalerm granted the right to Thaksin to establish IBC to benefit his close friend, seeing that the project had been denied by the previous administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://silance-mobius.blogspot.com/2007/11/blog-post_06.html |title=Thaksin's words }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it turned out to be a money loser and he eventually merged the company with the CP Group's UTV.&lt;ref name="TranscriptInterview" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UBC 2004 Annual Report, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1989, Thaksin established a data networking service, Shinawatra DataCom,&lt;ref name="TranscriptInterview" /&gt; today known as Advanced Data Network and owned by AIS and the TOT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investor.ais.co.th/FileUpload/Editor/DocumentUpload/WebContent/Annual%20Report/2010/068BusOperationsEN53.pdf |title=Business Operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries |journal=Company Annual Report |format=PDF |access-date=6 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903104301/http://investor.ais.co.th/FileUpload/Editor/DocumentUpload/WebContent/Annual%20Report/2010/068BusOperationsEN53.pdf |archivedate=3 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Thaksin's businesses were later consolidated as [[Shin Corp]].

===Advance Info Service and later ventures===
{{Main article|Advanced Info Service}}
[[Advance Info Service]] was given a monopoly contract by his contacts in the military in 1986&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"/&gt; and operates under GSM 900 frequency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ais.co.th/eng/company/ AIS corporate website], click on "About AIS", "Company profile", and then "1990"&lt;/ref&gt; AIS grew rapidly and became the largest mobile phone operator in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ais.co.th/eng/company/ AIS corporate website], click on "About AIS", "Company profile", and then "1994"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shinawatra Computer and Communications Group was founded in 1987 and [[Stock Exchange of Thailand|listed]] in 1990.

In 1990, Thaksin founded Shinawatra Satellite, which has developed and operated four [[Thaicom]] communications satellites.

In 1999, the Shinawatra family spent some 1&amp;nbsp;billion baht establishing [[Shinawatra University]] in [[Pathum Thani]]. It offers international programs in engineering, architecture, and business management, though it ranks quite low in international standings.

In 2000, Thaksin acquired the ailing [[ITV (Thailand)|iTV]] television station from the [[Crown Property Bureau]], [[Nation Multimedia Group]], and [[Siam Commercial Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/magazine/nations/0,8782,98445,00.html Taming The Media: Allegations of political interference cast a cloud over Thaksin's incoming administration] Asia Week Vol.27, No.6 16 February 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aseanfocus.com/asiananalysis/article.cfm?articleID=99 The Television Business, Democracy and The Army] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20030702173146/http://www.aseanfocus.com/asiananalysis/article.cfm?articleID=99 |date=2 July 2003 }} December 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entry into politics==

===Political debut===
Thaksin entered politics in late 1994 through [[Chamlong Srimuang]], who had just reclaimed the position of [[Palang Dharma Party]] (PDP) leader from [[Boonchu Rojanastien]]. In a subsequent purge of Boonchu-affiliated PDP Cabinet ministers, Thaksin was appointed Foreign Minister in December 1994, replacing [[Prasong Soonsiri]].&lt;ref&gt;Asia Times, [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HL22Ae01.html Grumbles, revelations of a Thai coup maker], 22 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin left Palang Dharma along with many of its [[House of Representatives of Thailand|MPs]] in 1996, and founded the [[populism|populist]] [[Thai Rak Thai]] (TRT) party in 1998. After a [[Thai general election, 2001|historic election victory in 2001]], he became prime minister, the country's first to serve a full term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Jan McGirk |title= Thaksin Shinawatra: The man who turned disaster into victory |publisher=BBC |date= 7 February 2005 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thaksin introduced a range of policies to alleviate rural poverty; highly popular, they helped reduce poverty by half in four years.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTTHAILAND/Resources/Economic-Monitor/2005nov-econ-full-report.pdf |title=Microsoft Word – TEM Oct05 Full version_Nov 7,2005 with ABB.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Should Thaksin Stay? |work=Time |date= 13 March 2006 |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1172779-3,00.html | first=Simon | last=Elegant}}&lt;/ref&gt; He launched the country's first [[universal healthcare]] program,&lt;ref&gt;NaRanong, Viroj, Na Ranong, Anchana, Universal Health Care Coverage: Impacts of the 30-Baht Health Care Scheme on the Rural Poor in Thailand, TDRI Quarterly Review, September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Health in Thailand|30-baht scheme]], as well as a highly notorious drug suppression campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Red light district reels as Thais embrace family values |author= Alex Spilius |work=Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date= 8 September 2001 |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/thailand/1339963/Red-light-district-reels-as-Thais-embrace-family-values.html | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin embarked on a massive program of infrastructure investment, including roads, public transit, and [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]].

The PDP soon withdrew from the government over the Sor Por Kor 4-01 land reform corruption scandal, causing the government of [[Chuan Leekpai]] to collapse.

===PDP leader and Deputy Prime Minister under Banharn===
Chamlong, strongly criticised for mishandling internal PDP politics in the last days of the Chuan-government, retired from politics and hand-picked Thaksin as new PDP leader. Thaksin ran for election for the first time for the constitutional tribunal and lost.

Thaksin joined the government of [[Banharn Silpa-Archa]] and was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in charge of Bangkok traffic. In May 1996, he and four other PDP ministers quit the Banharn Cabinet (while retaining their MP seats), prompting a Cabinet reshuffle. Many have claimed that Thaksin's move was designed to help give Chamlong Srimuang a boost in the June 1996 Bangkok Governor elections, which Chamlong returned from retirement to contest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pathfinder.com/asiaweek/96/0524/nat12.html Thailand: Double Trouble For the PM: A parliamentary vote splits the government coalition] 24 May 1996&lt;/ref&gt; But Chamlong lost to Bhichit Rattakul, an independent.

Chamlong's failure to buttress the PDP's failing power base in Bangkok amplified divisions in the PDP, particularly between Chamlong's "temple" faction and Thaksin's. Soon afterwards, Chamlong announced he was retiring again from politics.

Thaksin and the PDP pulled out of the Banharn-government in August 1996. In a subsequent no-confidence debate, the PDP gave evidence against the Banharn government, and in September 1996 Banharn dissolved Parliament.

Thaksin announced he would not run in the subsequent November 1996 elections but would remain as leader of the PDP. It suffered a fatal defeat in the elections, winning only one seat, and soon imploded, with most members resigning.

===Deputy Prime Minister under Chavalit===
On 15 August 1997, Thaksin became Deputy Prime Minister in [[Chavalit Yongchaiyudh]]'s government, after the Thai baht was floated and devalued on 2 July 1997, sparking the [[Asian Financial Crisis]]. He held the position for only three months, leaving on 14 November when Chavalit resigned.

During a censure debate on 27 September 1997, Democrat [[Suthep Thaugsuban]] accused Thaksin of profiting from insider information about the government's decision to float the baht,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pathfinder.com/asiaweek/97/1010/nat2.html Pressure from below: Supporters of the new, improved Constitution now have to help turn words into action] 10 October 1997&lt;/ref&gt; but the next Democrat party-led government did not investigate the accusations.

During this period, Thaksin also served on the Asia Advisory Board of the Washington, D.C. based [[Carlyle Group]] until he resigned upon becoming Prime Minister in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politicalfriendster.com/rateConnection.php?id1=3190&amp;id2=145 |title=Rate Connection – Thaksin Shinawatra connected to Carlyle Group |publisher=Political Friendster |date=7 May 2006 |accessdate=19 February 2010 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Thai Rak Thai Party and the 2001 elections===
Thaksin founded the [[Thai Rak Thai]] ("Thais Love Thais" – TRT) party in 1998 along with [[Somkid Jatusripitak]], PDP ally [[Sudarat Keyuraphan]], Purachai Piumsomboon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msutoday.msu.edu/news/index.php3?article=14Oct2004-8 MSU alumni, friends, honored for outstanding achievements: Purachai Piumsombun of Bangkok, Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212200729/http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/index.php3?article=14Oct2004-8 |date=12 February 2006 }} 14 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and 19 others.

With a populist platform often attributed to [[Somkid Jatusripitak|Somkid]], TRT promised universal access to healthcare, a 3-year debt moratorium for farmers, and 1&amp;nbsp;million THB locally managed development funds for all Thai villages.

After Prime Minister [[Chuan Leekpai]] dissolved parliament in November 2000, TRT won a sweeping victory in the [[Thailand legislative election, 2001|January 2001 elections]], the first held under the Constitution of 1997. At the time, some academics called it the most open, corruption-free election in Thai history.&lt;ref name="2001electionclean"&gt;Robert B.

Nonetheless, Thaksin opted for a broad coalition to gain total control and avoid a vote of no confidence, with the [[Chart Thai Party]] (41 seats) and the New Aspiration Party (36 seats), while absorbing the smaller Seritham Party (14 seats).&lt;ref&gt;Aurel Croissant and Jörn Dosch, Old Wine in New Bottlenecks?

==Prime Minister of Thailand, 2001–06==
[[Image:Thaksin Shinawatra (December 2001).jpg|thumb|Thaksin meeting [[Donald Evans]] in December 2001]]

Thaksin Shinawatra was the first prime minister of Thailand to complete a full term in office, and his rule is generally agreed to have been one of the most distinctive in the country's modern history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Profile: Thaksin Shinawatra |publisher=BBC |date=21 October 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initiated many eye-catching policies that distinguished him from his predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;Hewison, Kevin. "Thaksin Shinawatra and the reshaping of Thai politics." Contemporary Politics 16, no. 2 (June 2010): 119–133.&lt;/ref&gt; They affected the economy, public health, education, energy, social order, drug suppression and international relations. He gained one re-election victory.&lt;ref name=jam&gt;Protesters Jam Bangkok, but Rural Thais Love the Leader. ''The New York Times'', 6 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin's most effective policies were reducing rural poverty&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; and the introduction of universal healthcare, allowing him to galvanise the vast and largely untapped support base of the rural poor, especially in the populous northeast.&lt;ref name=jam /&gt;

His Cabinet consisted of a broad coalition of academics, former student leaders, and former leaders of the [[Palang Dharma Party]], including [[Prommin Lertsuridej]], Chaturon Chaisang, [[Prapat Panyachatraksa]], Surapong Suebwonglee, [[Somkid Jatusripitak]], [[Surakiart Sathirathai]], and [[Sudarat Keyuraphan]]. Traditional regional power brokers also flocked to his government.

However, his government was increasingly accused of dictatorship, [[demagogy]], corruption, conflicts of interest, human rights offences, acting undiplomatically, using legal loopholes and displaying hostility towards [[Censorship in Thailand|a free press]]. A highly controversial leader, he has also been the target of numerous allegations of [[lèse majesté in Thailand|lèse majesté]], treason, usurping religious and royal authority, selling assets to international investors, and [[Thailand political crisis 2005-2006#Phra Phrom Erawan Shrine incident|religious desecration]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===Economic policies===
Thaksin's government designed its policies to appeal to the rural majority, initiating programs like village-managed [[microcredit]] development funds, low-interest agricultural loans, direct injections of cash into village development funds (the SML scheme), infrastructure development, and the [[One Tambon One Product]] (OTOP) rural small and medium enterprise development program.

Thaksin's economic policies helped Thailand recover from the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] and substantially reduce poverty. GDP grew from 4.9&amp;nbsp;trillion baht in 2001 to 7.1&amp;nbsp;trillion baht in 2006. Thailand repaid its debts to the [[International Monetary Fund]] two years ahead of schedule.

Income in the northeast, the poorest part of the country, rose by 46% from 2001 to 2006.&lt;ref&gt;NESDB, [http://www.nesdb.go.th/Portals/0/eco_datas/account/gpp/GPP%201995-2006.zip Economic Data, 1995–2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719090712/http://www.nesdb.go.th/Portals/0/eco_datas/account/gpp/GPP%201995-2006.zip |date=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nationwide poverty fell from 21.3% to 11.3%.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Thailand's [[Gini coefficient]], a measure of [[income inequality]], fell from .525 in 2000 to .499 in 2004 (it had risen from 1996 to 2000) ).&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTTHAILAND/Resources/Economic-Monitor/2005nov-econ-full-report.pdf Thailand Economic Monitor November 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stock Exchange of Thailand]] outperformed other markets in the region.

Others claimed that the policies got the rural poor "hooked on Thaksin's hand-outs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/05/opinion/opinion_30015415.php|title=Forget the apologies, let the PM rebuild democracy|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014221520/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/05/opinion/opinion_30015415.php|archivedate=14 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin helped legalise Thailand's massive underground lottery system [[numbers game]] (Thai: หวย) to be run by the Government Lottery Office. Lottery sales of approximately 70&amp;nbsp;billion baht (US$2&amp;nbsp;billion) were used for social projects, including the "One District, One Scholarship" program. The Thaksin government also privatised MCOT, a large television and radio broadcaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/24/national/national_30019832.php|title=Activists call for MCOT delisting|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930004248/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/24/national/national_30019832.php|archivedate=30 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2006 coup, many of Thaksin's economic policies were ended, the OTOP program was rebranded, the Government Lottery Office's program was deemed illegal, and the government nationalised several media outlets and energy companies. However, economists from Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI) published a report indicating that many of the populist policies had not boosted the economy and some were by coincidence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/30/business/business_30000503.php|title=Thaksinomics 'not a driver of growth'|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717175908/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/30/business/business_30000503.php|archivedate=17 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healthcare policies===
Thaksin initiated two key healthcare policies: subsidised universal health care and low-cost universal access to anti-retroviral HIV medication (ARVs). Thaksin's 30-baht/visit universal healthcare program won the applause of the general public, but was criticised by many doctors and officials.&lt;ref name=Dual-track&gt;{{cite news |first=Charoen |last=Kittikanya |title=Dual-track system |url=http://www.bangkokpost.net/midyear2004/health01.html |newspaper=Bangkok Post |year=2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820004448/http://www.bangkokpost.net/midyear2004/health01.html |archivedate=20 August 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/07/14/national/national_30008668.php |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=14 July 2006 |title=Bt30 health scheme still lacks funds, says official |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015165033/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/07/14/national/national_30008668.php |archivedate=15 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the program's introduction, a large portion of the population had no health insurance and only limited access to healthcare. The program helped increase access to healthcare from 76% of the population to 96%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thaksin lauds his own achievements |publisher=Bangkok Post |url=http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=112327 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010025253/http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=112327 |archivedate=10 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program also increased workloads for health care employees, and caused many doctors to change to higher paying careers. It has also been criticised for being underfunded by the government. The program caused some hospitals to seek alternative sources of income, leading to a boom in [[medical tourism]], with 1.3&amp;nbsp;million foreign patients earning Thailand THB33&amp;nbsp;billion (US$800&amp;nbsp;million) in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=201904 85 Bogus Doctors Arrested In Thailand Last Year] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101121830/http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=201904 |date=1 January 2007 }} 6 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaiwebsites.com/medical-tourism-thailand.asp First International Trade Exhibition and Conference on Medical Tourism, Spa and Wellness Industries, in Bangkok, 20–23 March 2008] 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-coup public health minister Mongkol Na Songkhla called the 30 baht program a "marketing gimmick" and claimed that the government would "very soon" stop charging patients any fees for visits to state hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/13/national/national_30016065.php|title=Bt30 health fee may be scrapped|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031063056/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/13/national/national_30016065.php|archivedate=31 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people who received the treatment claimed that they prefer drugs from pharmacists than from facilities covered by the scheme and almost half of the patients were dissatisfied with the service given by the facilities.&lt;ref name=Dual-track /&gt; The universal health care scheme raised a debt of 7.7&amp;nbsp;billion baht.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Fernquest |title=Thailand's draft government budget for 2007 |url=http://www.readbangkokpost.com/business/2007_currency_crisis/thailands_draft_government_bud.php |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=16 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Thaksin government, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS as well as the overall [[prevalence]] rate noticeably declined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.unaids.org/pub/Report/2006/2006_country_progress_report_thailand_en.pdf Follow-up to the declaration of commitment on HIV/AIDS (UNGASS)] December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Although successful in expanding access to HIV medication, there have been concerns that a free trade agreement with the US could endanger Thailand's ability to produce generic HIV treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Public Health at Risk: A US Free Trade Agreement could threaten access to medicines in Thailand |publisher=The Oxford Committee for Famine Relief (Oxfam)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin allowed the estimated 2.3&amp;nbsp;million migrant workers in Thailand to register and seek health coverage under the Thai national healthcare system. They were also eligible for work permits at the end of the registration period, entitling them to full labour protection. [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]] Labour Group Committee Pongsak Plengsaeng criticised the move, claiming that it would lead to unemployment amongst Thais.

===The War on Drugs===
{{See also|Policies of the Thaksin administration#Anti-drug policies}}
Thaksin initiated several highly controversial policies to counter a perceived boom in the Thai drug market, particularly in [[methamphetamine]]. Earlier policies like border blocking (most methamphetamine is produced in [[Myanmar]]), education, sports, and promoting peer pressure had proved ineffective. In a 4 December 2002 speech on the eve of his birthday, King Bhumibol noted the rise in drug use and called for a "War on Drugs." Privy Councillor Phichit Kunlawanit called on the government to use its majority in parliament to establish a special court to deal with drug dealers, stating that "if we execute 60,000 the land will rise and our descendants will escape bad karma".&lt;ref&gt;Michael K. Connors, [http://sovereignmyth.blogspot.com/2009/09/ambivalent-about-rights.html Ambivalent About Rights: "Accidental" Killing Machines, Democracy and Coups D’etat.], Draft paper presented to Human Rights in Asia Workshop, University of Melbourne, 1–2 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 2003, Thaksin launched a campaign to rid "every square inch of the country" of drugs in three months.&lt;ref&gt;Anucha Yuwadee, Bangkok Post, 15 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of changing the punishment policy for drug addicts, setting provincial arrest and seizure targets including "blacklists", awarding government officials for achieving targets and threatening punishment for those who failed to make the quota, targeting dealers, and "ruthless" implementation. In the first three months, Human Rights Watch reports that 2,275 people were killed, almost double the number normally killed in drug-related violence.&lt;ref name="thaivisa.com"&gt;National News Bureau of Thailand, [http://www.thaivisa.com/forum/topic/378944-academics-call-for-law-to-prosecute-thaksin-in-world-court/ Academics call for law to prosecute Thaksin in World Court], 28 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/campaigns/aids/2004/thai.htm |title=The War on Drugs, HIV/AIDS, and Violations of Human Rights in Thailand |quote=Beginning in February 2003, the Thaksin government instructed police and local officials that persons charged with drug offenses should be considered "security threats" and dealt with in a "ruthless" and "severe" manner.

King Bhumibol, in a 2003 birthday speech, praised Thaksin and criticised those who counted only dead drug dealers while ignoring deaths caused by drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kanchanapisek.or.th/speeches/2003/1204.th.html |title=พระราชดำรัส พระราชทานแก่คณะบุคคลต่างๆ ที่เข้าเฝ้าฯ ถวายชัยมงคล ในโอกาสวันเฉลิมพระชนมพรรษา ณ ศาลาดุสิดาลัย สวนจิตรลดา พระราชวังดุสิตฯ วันพฤหัสบดีที่ ๔ ธันวาคม พ.ศ. ๒๕๔๖ (ฉบับไม่เป็นทางการ) |quote=ไอ้การชัยชนะของการปราบไอ้ยาเสพติดนี่ ดีที่ปราบ แล้วก็ที่เขาตำหนิบอกว่า เอ้ย คนตาย ตั้ง ๒,๕๐๐ คน อะไรนั่น เรื่องเล็ก ๒,๕๐๐ คน ถ้านายกฯ ไม่ได้ทำ นายกฯ ไม่ได้ทำ ทุกปี ๆ จดไว้นะ มีมากกว่า ๒,๕๐๐ คนที่ตาย ที่ตายทั้งคนที่เสพติด แล้วก็ขึ้นไป ฆ่าคน หรือทำอะไร เผาอะไรต่าง ๆ รวมทั้งเจ้าหน้าที่ที่ต้องไปปราบปกติ ก็ตายมากเหมือนกัน แต่ไม่พูดเท่านั้นเอง ไม่ไปนับ แต่นี้เขาก็นับไปชี้ ชี้ ชี้นับ พวกที่ค้า พวกที่ทำ ก็ตายเยอะเหมือนกัน ก่อนนี้ แต่ไม่พูดถึง เชื่อว่าพอๆ กับที่ได้จดว่า มีผู้ที่ตายในการสงครามต่อสู้ยาเสพติด ที่ทราบว่าคนตาย เพราะยาเสพติดนี่ มากมาย |publisher=The Golden Jubilee Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Victory in the War on Drugs is good. They may blame the crackdown for more than 2,500 deaths, but this is a small price to pay. If the prime minister failed to curb [the drug trade], over the years the number of deaths would easily surpass this toll.&lt;ref&gt;Asia Sentinel [http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?Itemid=185&amp;id=628&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view The Long Wait for Justice in Thailand], 10 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;"}}

Bhumibol also asked the commander of the police to investigate the killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{th icon}} Royal Jubilee Network, [http://kanchanapisek.or.th/speeches/2003/1204.th.html 2003 Birthday Speech of King Bhumibol Adulyadej]&lt;/ref&gt; Police Commander Sant Sarutanond reopened investigations into the deaths, and again claimed that few of the deaths were at the hands of the police.

The war on drugs was widely criticised by the international community. Thaksin requested that the [[UN Commission on Human Rights]] send a special envoy to evaluate the situation, but said in an interview, "The United Nations is not my father. I am not worried about any UN visit to Thailand on this issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=2&amp;id=75010&amp;date=4 |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=4 March 2003 |title=DRUG-RELATED KILLINGS: Verify the toll, say diplomats }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2006 coup, the military junta appointed a committee to investigate the anti-drug campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=120634 "Kanit to chair extrajudicial killings probe"] ''[[Bangkok Post]]'', 3 August 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006090211/http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=120634 |date=6 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Attorney General Kanit Na Nakorn led the committee. Concerning the committee's results ''[[The Economist]]'' reported in January 2008: "Over half of those killed in 2003 had no links to the drugs trade. The panel blamed the violence on a government 'shoot-to-kill' policy based on flawed blacklists. But far from leading to the prosecutions of those involved, its findings have been buried. The outgoing interim prime minister, Surayud Chulanont, took office vowing to right Mr Thaksin's wrongs. Yet this week he said there was insufficient evidence to take legal action over the killings. It is easy to see why the tide has turned. Sunai Phasuk, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, a lobbying group, says that the panel's original report named the politicians who egged on the gunmen. But after the PPP won last month's elections, those names were omitted."&lt;ref name=economist24jan08&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10566797 "Thailand's drug wars.

While he was opposition leader, [[Abhisit Vejjajiva]] accused Thaksin of [[crimes against humanity]] for his alleged role in the campaign. After being appointed Prime Minister, Abhisit opened an investigation into the killings, claiming that a successful probe could lead to prosecution by the [[International Criminal Court]]. Former attorney-general Kampee Kaewcharoen led the investigation and the investigation committee was approved by Abhisit's Cabinet. Abhisit denied that the probe was politically motivated. Witnesses and victims were urged to report to the Department of Special Investigation, which operated directly under Abhisit's control.&lt;ref name="thaivisa.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thailand Times, [http://thailandtimes.asia/thailand-news/thaksins-drug-murders-investigated/ Thaksin’s ‘Drug Murders’ investigated] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402164354/http://thailandtimes.asia/thailand-news/thaksins-drug-murders-investigated/ |date=2 April 2012 }}, 10 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personalthailand.com/threads/677-Extra-juridical-killing-cases-by-Thaksin-government-investigated-again-in-Thailand|title=Extra-juridical killing cases by Thaksin government investigated again in Thailand|work=Personal Thailand - Travel and Live in Thailand}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the August 2011 parliamentary elections, Abhisit's investigation failed to find or publicise any conclusive evidence linking Thaksin or members of his Government to any extrajudicial killings.

===Educational policies===
{{See also|Policies of the Thaksin government#Education policies}}
[[File:LulaShinawatra.jpg|thumb|Thaksin in a meeting with the [[President of Brazil]], [[Lula da Silva]], in 2004]]

One of Thaksin's educational reforms was school decentralisation, as mandated by the 1997 Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaiembdc.org/politics/govtment/policy/54thpolicy/policy_e.html|title=54th Thai Government Policy|author=|date=26 May 2001|website=archive.org|accessdate=15 March 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010526124921/http://www.thaiembdc.org/politics/govtment/policy/54thpolicy/policy_e.html|archivedate=26 May 2001|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was to delegate school management from the over-centralized and bureaucratised Ministry of Education to Tambon Administrative Organizations (TAOs), but met with massive widespread opposition from Thailand's 700,000 teachers, who would be deprived of their status as civil servants. Teachers also feared that TAOs lacked the ability to manage schools. In the face of massive teacher protests and several threats of school closure, Thaksin compromised and gave teachers whose schools were transferred to TAO management two years to transfer to other schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/article.php3?id_article=1009 Crisis in the 'Land of the Smile'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060917045902/http://internationalviewpoint.org/article.php3?id_article=1009 |date=17 September 2006 }} International Viewpoint, Online magazine: IV376 – March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Other intended policy changes included learning reform and related curricular decentralisation, mostly through greater use of holistic education and less use of rote learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etna.mcot.net/query.php?nid=19066 |title=Thai News Agency, Rote learning to be eliminated from schools, says PM, 21 January 2006 |publisher=Etna.mcot.net |accessdate=19 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016205115/http://etna.mcot.net/query.php?nid=19066 |archivedate=16 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To increase access to universities by lower income people, Thaksin initiated the Student Loan Fund (SLF) and Income Contingency Loan (ICL) programs. He initiated the ICL program to increase access to higher education, whereby needy students could secure a loan to support their studies from vocational to university levels. Thai banks had traditionally not given educational loans. The ICL, however, required recipients to start repayments when their salaries reached 16,000 baht a month, with interest equivalent to inflation from the day the loan was granted. The SLF had an eligibility limit on family income, but interest was 1 per cent starting a year after graduation. The programs were merged and the income limit modified after Thaksin's government was overthrown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/13/national/national_30018789.php|title=New student loan scheme to have higher family-income limit|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709030754/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/13/national/national_30018789.php|archivedate=9 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin was one of the first supporters of [[Nicholas Negroponte]]'s [[One Laptop Per Child]] (OLPC) project, with the Thai Ministry of Education committing to purchase 600,000 units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/08/15/byteline/index.php?news=byteline_18342256.html|title=Bangkok's Independent Newspaper|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712025355/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/08/15/byteline/index.php?news=byteline_18342256.html|archivedate=12 July 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The junta later cancelled the project.

Thaksin also initiated the controversial "One District, One Dream School" project, aimed at developing the quality of schools to ensure that every district had at least one high-quality school. It was criticised, with claims that the only beneficiaries were Thaksin and companies selling computers and educational equipment. Many schools fell deeply into debt in implementing the project, receiving inadequate financial support from the central government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=3&amp;id=121026&amp;usrsess= |title=Suicide puts spotlight on model schools' money woes |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=15 September 2005 |access-date=4 October 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929124804/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=3&amp;id=121026&amp;usrsess= |archive-date=29 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=THAI TALK: Nightmares haunt dream-school project |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=13 October 2005 |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/10/13/opinion/index.php?news=opinion_18859784.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614082702/http://nationmultimedia.com/2005/10/13/opinion/index.php?news=opinion_18859784.html |archivedate=14 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, he altered the state university entrance system, which had relied exclusively on nationally standardised exams. Thaksin pushed for greater weighting of senior high-school grades in the hope of focusing students on classroom learning rather than private entrance exam tutoring.

===Energy policies===
{{See also|Policies of the Thaksin government#Energy policies|Energy Industry Liberalization and Privatization (Thailand)}}

In energy policy, the Thaksin government continued the [[Chuan Leekpai]] government's privatisation agenda, but with important changes. Whereas the Chuan government's post-[[Asian financial crisis]] policies sought economic efficiency through industry fragmentation and wholesale [[Electricity market|power pool]] competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/ffd/domestic/2001/0927trump.htm |title=Far Eastern Economic Review, "Power Politics Trump Reform", 27 September 2001 |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date=27 September 2001 |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin's policies aimed to create [[Leadership|national champions]] that could reliably support stronger economic growth and become important players in regional energy markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://my.reset.jp/~adachihayao/040503C.htm Bangkok Post, "Raising sector efficiency `crucial': Utility's B140bn debt strains public purse"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529234341/http://my.reset.jp/~adachihayao/040503C.htm |date=29 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin also initiated a policy to encourage renewable energy and energy conservation. Many Thaksin-era energy policies were reversed following the 2006 coup.

===South Thailand insurgency===
{{See also|South Thailand insurgency}}

A resurgence in violence began in 2001 in the three southernmost provinces of Thailand with their Muslim, ethnic Malay majority. There is much controversy about the causes of this escalation. Attacks after 2001 concentrated on police, the military, and schools, but civilians (including Buddhist monks) are also regular targets. Thaksin was widely criticised for his management of the situation.

Of three key controversial incidents, the first was the Army's storming of the [[Krue Sae Mosque|Krue Se Mosque]], where protesters had holed up and were killed.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E4DA123CF931A15754C0A9639C8B63&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fT%2fThaksin%20Shinawatra U.N. Criticizes Emergency Powers], Warren Hoge, 22 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The second, in October 2004, was the killing of 84 Muslim demonstrators at [[Tak Bai]], when the Army broke up a peaceful protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=THAILAND: At least 84 people killed in Southern Thailand |publisher=Asian Human Rights Commission |date=26 October 2004 |url=http://www.ahrchk.net/ua/mainfile.php/2004/838/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of detainees were forced at gunpoint to lie shackled and prone in Army trucks, stacked like cordwood. The trucks were delayed from moving to the detainment area for hours. The 84 victims were reported to have been asphyxiated, crushed or died of overheating. The precise nature and cause of death have been subject to controversy and doubt because of lack of transparency and absence of depth in investigations made. There are other reports of many more deaths but these have not been substantiated.

In a third incident, Muslim lawyer [[Somchai Neelapaijit]] disappeared, allegedly abducted and killed by police for his role in defending alleged insurgents who claimed to have been tortured. Despite witness testimony and forensic evidence during the court of police investigations and court trials, all allegations against police said to be involved were dropped and the enforced disappearance case closed.

Thaksin announced an escalation of military and police activity in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Somchai Phatharathananunth "Civil Society and Democratization" p.222&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2005, Thaksin enacted an Emergency Decree to manage the three troubled provinces. Several human rights organisations expressed their concerns that the decree might be used to violate civil liberties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Human Rights Watch |url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/08/04/thaila11592.htm |title=Emergency Decree Violates Thai Constitution and Laws |date=4 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005, Thaksin established the National Reconciliation Commission, chaired by former Prime Minister [[Anand Panyarachun]] to oversee efforts to bring peace to the troubled South. In its final report in June 2006, the commission proposed introducing elements of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and making [[Yawi language|Pattani-Malay (Yawi)]] an official language in the region along with Thai. The Thaksin administration assigned a government committee to study the report, but nothing came of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/07/regional/regional_30005908.php |title=Government shrugs off NRC final report |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=7 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614195700/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/07/regional/regional_30005908.php |archivedate=14 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin blamed Malaysia's jungle that has occasionally been used to train Islamic militants to cause violence in the south and Indonesia for being an inspiration to the militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/south2years/dec2304.php|title=The Nation: Southern Unrest|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527043825/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/south2years/dec2304.php|archivedate=27 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative reform===
One of the most visible of Thaksin's administrative reforms was the restructuring of government department and ministries, labelled the "big bang." It was hailed as a "historic breakthrough" and "the first major reorganization of ministries since King Chulalongkorn set up Thailand's modern system of departmental government in 1897." Plans had been studied for years to loosen perceived rigidities and inertia of the old system but were not implemented until the Thaksin government.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Painter, Managerial Reform and Political Control, Department of Public and Social Administration, City University of Hong Kong, [http://www.sog-rc27.org/Paper/Scancor/Martin_Painter.doc the Case of Thaksin and the Thai Bureaucracy*] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012055631/http://www.sog-rc27.org/Paper/Scancor/Martin_Painter.doc |date=12 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The restructuring was designed to streamline the bureaucracy and focus it on performance and results. New ministries were carved out in Social and Human Security Development, Tourism and Sports, Natural Resources and Environment, Information and Communication Technology, and Culture.

Thaksin transformed the role of provincial governors to that of active policy managers. Historically, central government ministries operated in the provinces through field offices headed by senior officials who reported back to Bangkok, while the Interior Ministry appointed provincial governors whose role was largely ceremonial.

A key component of Thaksin's administrative reform policy, the "CEO-governors" epitomised what was called his "transformation of the operating style of the traditional bureaucracy into a more results-oriented instrument that would be responsive." Piloted in 2001 and introduced in all provinces in October 2003, CEO-governors were put in charge of planning and co-ordinating provincial development and became accountable for overall provincial affairs. The "CEO governors" were assisted by "provincial CFOs" from the Ministry of Finance who reported directly to each governor. Governors were authorised to raise funds by issuing bonds and were given an intensive training course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Kellogg School of Management |url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news/hits/030817bp.htm |title=CEO governors mini-premiers, says PM: Can issue bonds, use management methods |date=17 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the coup, the junta reverted the role of governors.

The Thaksin era also saw the opening of a number of government one-stop service centres to reduce red tape for anything from investment to utilities and ID-card processing.

===Foreign policies===
[[Image:Vladimir Putin in Thailand 21-22 October 2003-1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Thaksin with the [[President of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]] at [[APEC Bangkok 2003]] on 21 October 2003 in Bangkok]]
Thaksin initiated negotiations for several [[free trade agreement]]s with China, Australia, Bahrain, India, and the US. The latter especially was criticised, with claims that high-cost Thai industries could be wiped out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=กลุ่มศึกษาข้อตกลงเขตการค้าเสรีภาคประชาชน |url=http://www.ftawatch.org/ |title=FTA Watch Group website |publisher=Ftawatch.org |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thailand joined the US-led invasion of Iraq, sending a 423-strong humanitarian contingent. It withdrew its troops on 10 September 2004. Two Thai soldiers died in Iraq in an insurgent attack.

Thaksin announced that Thailand would forsake foreign aid, and work with donor countries to assist in the development of neighbours in the Greater Mekong Sub-region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=3502 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040906011819/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=3502 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 September 2004 |work=Straits Times |title=Thaksin's Chance for Leading Role in the Region |date=10 March 2004 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin was repeatedly attacked for acting undiplomatically with foreign leaders and the international community. Besides his famous swipe at the UN (see The 'war on drugs' above), there were also allegations of gaffes at international meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/26/headlines/headlines_30000240.php |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |title=Ex-envoys tell of 'multi-tasking' premier |date=17 March 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907051258/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/26/headlines/headlines_30000240.php |archivedate=7 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin was keen to position Thailand as a regional leader, initiating various development projects in poorer neighbouring countries like Laos. More controversially, he established close, friendly ties with the Burmese dictatorship, including extending the impoverished country a 4&amp;nbsp;billion baht credit line so it could conclude a satellite telecom deal with his family business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burmait.net/ict-news/2007/aug07/thaksin-to-face-charges-over-burma-telecom-deal/ 'Thaksin to face charges over Burma telecom deal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103061415/http://www.burmait.net/ict-news/2007/aug07/thaksin-to-face-charges-over-burma-telecom-deal/ |date=3 January 2009 }}. ICT News, 2 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Powell Thaksin 20020729.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] and Thailand Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra at Government House]]
Thaksin energetically supported his former foreign minister [[Surakiart Sathirathai]]'s somewhat improbable campaign to become UN Secretary General.

===Suvarnabhumi Airport===
Despite debate and long abandonment of the plan due to the stability of the ground for the location of the airport, the Thaksin government pushed to complete the construction of the new Suvarnabhumi International Airport. The airport was officially opened a week after Thaksin's government was overthrown. It is one of the world's largest airports.

However, some members of Thaksin's government were accused of [[corruption in the Suvarnabhumi Airport project]]. These allegations were used by the military junta to justify the 2006 coup.&lt;ref&gt;International Herald Tribune, [http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/02/02/news/thai.php Thailand's airport imbroglio grows], 2 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CDRM|junta]] initiated several investigations into the airport. Nevertheless, investigative panels found that damage to the airport was "minute" and "common." The cost of repairing the damage was estimated at less than 1% of the total airport cost. The junta was accused by its opponents of delaying airport repairs and intensifying the airport's problems to pin further blame on the Thaksin government. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Criticism===

===="Policy corruption"====
Thaksin was accused of "policy corruption", such as infrastructure and liberalisation policies that, while legal and a potential benefit to society, also aided companies that were owned by his family members.&lt;ref name="PolicyCorruption"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/01/headlines/headlines_30015092.php|title=Thaksin-era corruption'cost state Bt400 bn'|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115212205/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/01/headlines/headlines_30015092.php|archivedate=15 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supannee Chai-amporn and Sirinthip Arun-rue of the National Institute of Development Administration claimed that policy corruption caused the state to spend nearly 30 per cent more than it otherwise should have spent, costing the state an additional 400&amp;nbsp;billion [[baht]]. Other examples cited were the Board of Investment's granting tax breaks worth a total of THB16.4&amp;nbsp;billion to Shin Satellite for its iPSTAR project in 2003, and the Transport Ministry's decision the same year to abolish the minimum air fare of THB3.8 /km when Shin Corp was about to enter into a joint venture with low-cost carrier [[AirAsia]] to open a Thai subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tackling the 'policy corruption' of the Thaksin regime |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=5 November 2006 |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/05/opinion/opinion_30018078.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013143400/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/05/opinion/opinion_30018078.php |archivedate=13 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2006 coup, the military junta-appointed Assets Examination Committee froze Thaksin's assets based on charges of policy corruption.&lt;ref name="Sentinel"&gt;Asia Sentinel, [http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=536&amp;Itemid=185 Thailand's Thaksin Freeze Out], 14 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin denied the allegations. "They just made up a beautiful term to use against me. There's no such thing in this government. Our policies only serve the interests of the majority of the people", he said.&lt;ref name="Sentinel"/&gt; From 2002 to 2006, the stock price of Shin Corp increased from 38 to 104 baht (an increase of 173 per cent) while the stock price of Shin Satellite fell. In the same period, the Stock Exchange of Thailand index rose 161 per cent, and the price of other major SET blue chip companies increased vastly more. Industry deregulation caused the market share of AIS to fall from 68 per cent to 53 per cent.&lt;ref name="Sentinel"/&gt;

====Corruption====
[[Transparency International]] reported that Thailand's reputation for transparency among business executives improved somewhat during the years of the Thaksin government. In 2001, Thailand's [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] (CPI) was 3.2 (ranked 61), whilst in 2005, the CPI was 3.8 (ranked 59).&lt;ref&gt;Thai Public Relations Department, "Thailand's Image on Transparency", 26 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Transparency International [http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2005 TI 2005 Corruption Perceptions Index] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512023516/http://transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2005 |date=12 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Transparency International, [http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2001 Corruption Perceptions Index 2001] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929153638/http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2001 |date=29 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, a study of [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] by the [[World Bank]] gave Thailand a lower score on Control of Corruption during 2002–2005 under Thaksin when compared to the Democrat-led government of 1998–2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/pdf/c213.pdf |title=Worldwide Governance Indicators |format=PDF |accessdate=19 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710170031/http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/pdf/c213.pdf |archivedate=10 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008 Thaksin Shinawatra was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in absentia over a corrupt land deal. In a ruling that made him the first Thai politician to be convicted of corruption committed while prime minister, Thaksin was found to have violated conflict of interest rules in helping his wife buy land from a state agency at a reduced price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/21/thaksin-thailand-corruption|title=Former Thai PM Thaksin found guilty of corruption|author=Ian MacKinnon|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other charges====
Immediately after the events in March 2010, Abhisit Vejjajivas stated that he would talk to the red shirt leadership, but not to Thaksin. He criticised Thaksin's wealth and extravagance, carving a contrast between the alleged opulence of the premier's house and the humbler, agrarian roots of many of the demonstrators. Shortly after, he also directly condemned his opponent's self-proclaimed affinity with the ordinary people, the "phrai", arguing that Thaksin was far closer to the "ammart", or the traditional elites in Thailand's army, bureaucracy, and political parties.&lt;ref&gt;The Diplomat, [http://the-diplomat.com/2010/03/21/thailand%E2%80%99s-blood-red-protest/ Thailand's Blood Red Protest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527095707/http://the-diplomat.com/2010/03/21/thailand%E2%80%99s-blood-red-protest/ |date=27 May 2010 }}, 21 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin's government was accused of exerting political influence in its [[Censorship of radio and film (Thailand)|crackdown on unlicensed community radio stations]], and Thaksin brought massive defamation suits against critical journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2005/06/01/national/index.php?news=national_17552513.html |date=1 June 2005 |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |title=Community-radio crackdown panned |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215020/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/06/01/national/index.php?news=national_17552513.html |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Acting prime minister files more criminal and defamation lawsuits |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |date=15 June 2006 |url=http://cpj.org/2006/06/thailand-acting-prime-minister-files-more-criminal.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin was also accused of interference when the Senate appointed [[Wisut Montriwat]] (former Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance) to the position of Auditor General, replacing [[Jaruvan Maintaka]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===2005 re-election===
Under the slogans "Four Years of Repair{{spaced ndash}}Four years of Reconstruction" and "Building Opportunities", Thaksin and the TRT won landslide victories in [[Thai general election, 2005|February 2005 elections]], sweeping 374 out of 500 seats in Parliament. The election had the highest voter turnout in Thai history. But his second term was soon beset by protests, with claims that he presided over a "parliamentary dictatorship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand Election Triumph: Re-packaging old politics? |publisher=ASEAN Focus Group, Australian National University |accessdate=4 April 2009 |url=http://www.aseanfocus.com/asiananalysis/article.cfm?articleID=838 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720192841/http://www.aseanfocus.com/asiananalysis/article.cfm?articleID=838 |archivedate=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations by Sondhi Limthongkul===
The political crisis was catalysed by several accusations published by media mogul and popular talk show host [[Sondhi Limthongkul]], a former Thaksin supporter who had broken with him. These included accusations that Thaksin:
* Restricted press freedom by suing Sondhi after he printed a sermon by a [[Luang Ta Maha Bua|controversial monk]] (see [[Thailand political crisis 2005-2006#Luang Ta Maha Bua incident|Luang Ta Maha Bua incident]])
* Masterminded the desecration of the famous [[Erawan Shrine|Erawan]] shrine (see [[Thailand political crisis 2005-2006#Phra Phrom Erawan Shrine incident|Phra Phrom Erawan Shrine incident]])

===Sale of Shin Corporation===
{{Main article|Sale of Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings}}
On 23 January 2006, the Shinawatra family sold their entire stake in [[Shin Corporation]] to [[Temasek Holdings]]. The Shinawatra and Damapong families netted about 73&amp;nbsp;billion [[baht]] (about US$1.88&amp;nbsp;billion) tax-free from the sale, using a regulation that made individuals who sell shares on the [[Stock Exchange of Thailand|stock exchange]] exempt from [[capital gains tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/shincorp/shin22.html |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |title=Complex transaction a model for avoiding tax, ownership law |date=27 January 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712041022/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/shincorp/shin22.html |archivedate=12 July 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thaksin was the target of accusations of corruption for selling forbidden national assets such as national utility company to a foreign entity in exchange for personal profits and kickbacks.  Thai laws at the time disallowed the sale of integral assets of national importance to the public or to any foreign entity, but Thaksin amended the laws to allow such sale.

===Anti-Thaksin rallies===
{{See also|Thailand political crisis 2005-2006}}
Thaksin faced pressure to resign following the Shin Corp. sale.

Protests, led by the [[People's Alliance for Democracy]] (PAD) whose leaders included Chamlong and Sondhi, soon swelled to tens of thousands who occupied the area around Government House in Bangkok.&lt;ref&gt;[[n:Tens of thousands rally against Thailand's Prime Minister]]&lt;/ref&gt; They consisted of both working-class and middle-class Bangkokians and included prominent social figures, academics and students.

===House dissolution and election===
{{Main article|Thailand legislative election, April 2006}}
Thaksin announced a [[Dissolution of parliament|House dissolution]] on 24 February 2006. General elections were scheduled for 2 April.

Thaksin was attacked for calling the snap elections, which in effect prevented any member of parliament from changing parties. In an editorial, ''The Nation'' noted it "fails to take into consideration a major fallacy of the concept [of democracy], particularly in a less-developed democracy like ours, in which the impoverished, poorly informed masses are easily manipulated by people of his ilk. And Thaksin's manipulation has been well documented."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/21/opinion/opinion_20003175.php |title=Democracy put to the ultimate test |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=21 March 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926231731/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/21/opinion/opinion_20003175.php |archivedate=26 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Election results and by-elections===
Thaksin's TRT Party won the widely boycotted elections, gaining 462 seats in Parliament, with the ratio of voters to no-voters 16:10, not counting non-voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30000870 |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=5 October 2006 |title=Thai Rak Thai win 16&amp;nbsp;million votes: Thaksin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427050223/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30000870 |archivedate=27 April 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by-elections were needed for 40 TRT candidates who failed to win the minimum 20% required by the 1997 Constitution in an uncontested seat.&lt;ref name="NationSecond"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/03/headlines/headlines_30000858.php |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=4 April 2006 |title=38 one-horse candidates fail |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206162906/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/03/headlines/headlines_30000858.php |archivedate=6 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30000955 |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=5 October 2006 |title=Second round of elections be held on 23 April |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908022737/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30000955 |archivedate=8 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Democrat Party refused to contest them&lt;ref name="NationSecond" /&gt; and, along with the [[People's Alliance for Democracy|PAD]], petitioned the Central Administrative Court to cancel them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Democrat asks court to cancel 2nd round of election |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30001232 |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=5 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120030/http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30001232 |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chamlong Srimuang declared that the PAD would ignore the elections and "go on rallying until Thaksin resigns and Thailand gets a royally appointed prime minister".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30000759 |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=5 October 2006 |title=PAD ignores vote results |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061122030026/http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30000759 |archivedate=22 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were held on 25 April and resulted in the TRT winning 25 of the constituencies and losing 2. Yet another round of by-elections on 29 April was scheduled for 13 constituencies. The Thai Rak Thai Party was later accused and found guilty of paying smaller parties to contest the election to fulfill the 20% rule, while the Democrat Party was accused of paying smaller parties not to. The by-elections were suspended by the Constitution Court while it deliberated whether to annul the main elections. In press interviews in exile, Thaksin was to insist on his technical majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=CNN |title=Thaksin Shinawatra Talkasia Transcript |date=12 February 2007 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/01/22/talkasia.thaksin.script/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invalidation of the elections===
On 8 May 2006, the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]] ruled 8–6 to invalidate the April elections based on the awkward positioning of voting booths. The ruling was called a landmark case in "judicial activism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Bangkok Post |title=End of the beginning in Thailand's crisis 19 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Democrat Party, which had boycotted the April elections, said they were now ready to contest an October election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/08/headlines/headlines_30003512.php |title=Constitution Court invalidate the April election and order new election |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=8 April 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616174003/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/08/headlines/headlines_30003512.php |archivedate=16 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new election was ordered and later set for [[Thailand legislative election, October 2006|15 October]]. The Court found the Election Commissioners guilty of malfeasance and jailed them. But the election was cancelled when the [[2006 Thailand coup d'état|military seized power on 19 September]].

===Break from politics===
Thaksin announced on 4 April 2006 that he would not accept the post of Prime Minister after Parliament reconvened, but would continue as Caretaker Prime Minister until then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Channel NewsAsia |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/201527/1/.html |date=4 April 2006 |title=Thai PM Thaksin says he'll stop down}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then delegated his functions to Caretaker Deputy Prime Minister [[Chidchai Wannasathit]], moved out of Government House, and went on vacation.

==September 2006 coup==
{{Main article|2006 Thai coup d'état}}
In the evening of 19 September 2006, while Thaksin was visiting New York City to attend a UN summit and speak at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], the army took control of Bangkok. At Government House, some 50 soldiers ordered approximately 220 policemen in the complex to lay down their weapons. Troops also surrounded the [[Thaicom]] satellite receiving station and state-run television station Channel 11. By the morning of 20 September, tanks and military vehicles armed with machine guns were stationed at Government House, the Royal Plaza and government units along Rajdamnoen Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thai armed forces seize Bangkok |agency=Reuters |date=19 September 2006 |url=http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articlenews.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2006-09-19T164005Z_01_BKK256153_RTRUKOC_0_UK-THAILAND-EMERGENCY.xml&amp;pageNumber=0&amp;imageid=&amp;cap=&amp;sz=13&amp;WTModLoc=NewsArt-C1-ArticlePage2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211164830/http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articlenews.aspx?type=topNews |archivedate=11 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Troops participating in the coup were from the 1st and 3rd Army Regions, the [[Internal Security Operations Command]], the Special Warfare Centre and Army units in Nakhon Ratchasima and Prachin Buri provinces and sections of the Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=nationmultimedia.com|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/20/headlines/headlines_30014074.php|title=Caretaker PM tries to fight back|date=20 September 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102202724/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/20/headlines/headlines_30014074.php|archivedate=2 November 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to coup leader Army Commander General [[Sonthi Boonyaratglin]], the coup leaders had arrested Deputy Prime Minister [[Chitchai Wannasathit]] and Defense Minister [[Thammarak Isaragura na Ayuthaya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article1621779.ece One night in Bangkok] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008104423/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article1621779.ece |date=8 October 2006 }}, 19 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The military, originally calling itself the [[Council for Democratic Reform under the Constitutional Monarch]] (CDRM), issued a statement citing the government's alleged ''[[lèse majesté in Thailand|lèse majesté]]'', corruption, interference with state agencies, and creation of social divisions as reasons for the coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/20/headlines/headlines_30014072.php |title=Statement from the military reformist |date=20 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212504/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/20/headlines/headlines_30014072.php |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It declared the king of Thailand the head of state, and said elections would be held soon to return democracy to the country. Thaksin later arrived in [[UK|Britain]], where he had family.

===Thai Rak Thai party===
Many [[Thai Rak Thai]] party members were reported to have resigned from the party in the aftermath of the coup for fear that the party would be dissolved by the junta and its members banned from politics. These included Somsak Thepsuthin and 100 members of the Wang Nam Yen faction. It was not clear whether [[Suriya Jungrungreangkit]], another influential member of the faction, would also resign. [[Sontaya Kunplome]] was reported to have led 20 members of the Chonburi faction in resigning from the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015188 |title=Sonthaya leads 20 members out of Thai Rak Thai |date=3 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014221431/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015188 |archivedate=14 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015187 |title=Somsak leads 100 members to resign from Thai Rak Thai |date=3 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528033455/http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015187 |archivedate=28 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 October 2006 Thaksin and his former deputy Somkid Jatusipitak resigned from the TRT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=2 October 2006 |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/03/headlines/headlines_30015263.php |title=Thaksin resigns from Thai Rak Thai |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303183911/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/03/headlines/headlines_30015263.php |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=2 October 2006 |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015265 |title=Somkid resigns from Thai Rak Thai Party |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012233156/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015265 |archivedate=12 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaturon Chaisang took over as party head.

The TRT was finally dissolved on 30 May 2007 by the Constitutional Tribunal, which banned over 100 of its executives, including Thaksin, from politics for five years, based on charges that two party executives (Defense Minister Thammarak and Pongsak Raktapongpaisarn) bribed a smaller party to stand in the [[April 2006 Thailand legislative election|April 2006 election]]. The Democrat party was cleared on a similar charge.

===2006 Bangkok New Year's Eve bombings===
{{Main article|2006 Bangkok bombings}}
On 31 December 2006 and 1 January 2007, several bombs exploded in Bangkok, killing and wounding a number of bystanders. General Surayud accused "those who lost power as a result of the military takeover" of masterminding the bombings, but did not directly identify Thaksin. Thaksin went on CNN to publicly deny any involvement in the bombings. The government did not make any arrests in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/01/01/headlines/headlines_30023035.php|title=Surayud suspects "power losers" as finger--pointing begins|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220033330/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/01/01/headlines/headlines_30023035.php|archivedate=20 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal charges===
Thaksin's [[diplomatic passport]] was revoked on 31 December 2006 after the junta accused him of engaging in political activities while in exile. Thai embassies were ordered not to facilitate his travels.

A junta-appointed Assets Examination Committee froze Thaksin's assets and attempted to bring charges against him. The AEC was criticised for being stacked with anti-Thaksin appointees. At one point, AEC Secretary [[Kaewsan Atibodhi]] claimed that "evidence and witnesses are useless", when an AEC panel recommended legal action without hearing 300 witnesses or considering 100 additional pieces of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, 9 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The AEC froze Thaksin's assets

In January 2007, Financial Institutions Development Fund complied with an Assets Examination Committee request to file a charge against Thaksin and his wife over their purchase of four 772&amp;nbsp;million baht plots of land from the FIDF in 2003. The charge was based on alleged violation of Article 100 of the National Counter Corruption Act, which prohibits government officials and their spouses from entering into or having interests in contracts made with state agencies under their authority.

The Assets Examination Committee also accused Thaksin of issuing an unlawful cabinet resolution approving the spending of state funds to buy rubber saplings.

In March 2007, the Office of the Attorney-General charged Thaksin's wife and brother-in-law with conspiring to evade taxes of 546&amp;nbsp;million baht (US$15.6&amp;nbsp;million) in a 1997 transfer of Shin Corp shares.

The Assets Examination Committee found Thaksin guilty of malfeasance for obstructing competition by imposing an excise tax on telecom operators. Thaksin's Cabinet had approved the relevant executive decree in 2003.

==Purchase of Manchester City Football Club==
As prime minister, Thaksin had unsuccessfully sought to buy the English [[Premier League]] football clubs [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and later [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], in what critics claimed was a publicity stunt in response to his political problems.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, [http://uk.reuters.com/article/footballNews/idUKSP17548520070706?pageNumber=3 NEWSMAKER-City takeover keeps Thaksin in the political limelight], 6 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2007, now out of office, he bought Premier League club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] for £81.6&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;PLUS Markets Group [https://archive.is/20070911041449/http://www.plusmarketsgroup.com/story.shtml?ISIN=GB0005599336&amp;NewsID=25324 Manchester City plc – Offer unconditional in all respects], 7 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He became briefly popular with fans (who nicknamed him 'Frank'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/11/football.comment | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Simon | last=Hattenstone | title=Why Thaksin's billions are a fan's living nightmare | date=10 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;), especially after appointing [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] manager of the club and bringing in prominent players.&lt;ref&gt;Official Manchester City website, [http://www.mcfc.co.uk/default.sps?pageid=115&amp;pagegid=%7BDBD12D53%2D8346%2D431D%2DA04F%2D5D0F8664DE80%7D&amp;newsid=439107&amp;siteid=&amp;pageno=1&amp;newscategory=&amp;frommonth=5&amp;fromyear=2007&amp;tomonth=7&amp;toyear=2007 Sven-Goran Eriksson appointed Manchester City Manager] 6 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Eriksson was later critical of Thaksin's running of the club, saying "he [Thaksin] didn't understand football – he hadn't a clue."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=England need a winter break, says Sven-Goran Eriksson |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/8682830/England-need-a-winter-break-says-Sven-Goran-Eriksson.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=4 August 2011 |first=Henry |last=Winter |accessdate=4 August 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sold the club to investors from [[Abu Dhabi United Group]] in September 2008 for a reported £200&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester City Owner Agrees to Sell to Abu Dhabi|publisher=Bloomberg |date =2 September 2008 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&amp;sid=a1QqM9gkEXWQ&amp;refer=uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After selling Manchester City Football Club, Thaksin was nominated as "honorary president" but does not have any administrative responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=New York Times|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/01/world/europe/01iht-thaksin.1.15793147.html|title=Thaksin sells Manchester City club to Emirates group|date= 1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was later dismissed from honorary club president after the club has decided to take a position against him following his conviction and is currently "on the run" from Thai authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/feb/10/manchester-city-thaksin-sacked|title=Football: Manchester City dump Thaksin Shinawatra from president's role|author=Daniel Taylor|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convictions and exile==
In May 2007, Prime Minister [[Surayud Chulanont]] said Thaksin was free to return to Thailand, and he would personally guarantee Thaksin's safety. In January 2008 Thaksin's wife Potjaman was arrested on arrival in [[Bangkok]] but released on bail after appearing at the Supreme Court, with orders not to leave the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7176160.stm |title=/2, Thaksin's wife back in Thailand |date=8 January 2008 |accessdate=19 February 2010 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was set to be tried for alleged violation of [[stock]]-trading and land sale laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7203913.stm news.bbc.co.uk, Ex-PM's wife set for Thai trial] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ratchadaphisek land verdict===
{{See also|Potjaman Shinawatra#Ratchadaphisek land purchase controversy}}
On 21 October 2008, the Supreme Court's Criminal Division for Holders of Political Positions ruled that Thaksin, while prime minister, abused his power to help his wife buy public land at auction, and sentenced him to two years in jail.&lt;ref&gt;[Online].

Soon after, Thaksin told [[Reuters]], "I have been informed of the result. I had long anticipated that it would turn out this way", and added that the case was politically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/topstories/topstories.php?id=131548 ''Thaksin guilty of corruption''] Bangkok Post (21 October 2008.

===Self-imposed exile===
On 10 November 2008, a Philippine spokesman said his government would "politely" turn down any request for political refuge from Thaksin due to [[Manila]]'s "friendly" relations with [[Bangkok]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20081110-171229/RP-closes-door-on-Thaksin |title=newsinfo.inquirer.net, RP closes door on Thaksin |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |accessdate=19 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418023813/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20081110-171229/RP-closes-door-on-Thaksin |archivedate=18 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=(AFP) – 8 November 2008 |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iIJDty8bXGTsp4wJ0RfqmtmSKzMg |title=afp.google.com/article, Philippine asylum for Thaksin unlikely: foreign dept official |publisher=Google |date=8 November 2008 |accessdate=19 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418065844/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iIJDty8bXGTsp4wJ0RfqmtmSKzMg |archivedate=18 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/388799/1/.html |title=channelnewsasia.com, Philippine foreign dept official says asylum for Thaksin unlikely |publisher=Channelnewsasia.com |date=10 November 2008 |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Government [[Home Office]], meanwhile, revoked Potjaman and Thaksin's [[visa (document)|visas]] due to their convictions, while the Bangkok British Embassy e-mailed airlines directing them to disallow either of them to board flights to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/11/09/news/10thaksin.php UK visa revoked, Thaksin looks for new home] www.iht.com&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2008, ''[[Arabian Business]]'' reported after an exclusive interview that the UK froze $4.2&amp;nbsp;billion of his assets in the UK. However, the UK government has not confirmed or denied this claim.&lt;ref name="DownToLast500million"&gt;Straits Times, [http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/SE%2BAsia/Story/STIStory_318574.html Down to his last US$500m] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309110255/http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking+News/SE+Asia/Story/STIStory_318574.html |date=9 March 2009 }}, 26 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin had reportedly considered sanctuaries such as [[China]], the [[Bahamas]], [[Nicaragua]], and several other countries in [[South America]] and [[Africa]]. Reports said the Shinawatras were granted honorary citizenship by the Bahamas and Nicaragua, and were building a £5.5&amp;nbsp;million home in China. As of late May 2009, he reportedly remained in [[Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/388847/1/.html |title=www.channelnewsasia.com, Thailand to push Thaksin extradition wherever he goes |publisher=Channelnewsasia.com |date=10 November 2008 |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=(AFP) – 9 November 2008 |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gEpvCQ8QzDppeQTiAAWBHv91BoPA |title=afp.google.com, Thailand to push Thaksin extradition wherever he goes: officials |publisher=Google |date=9 November 2008 |accessdate=19 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418064751/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gEpvCQ8QzDppeQTiAAWBHv91BoPA |archivedate=18 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Police: Thaksin still in UAE |publisher=Bangkok Post |date=21 May 2009 |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/143938/police-thaksin-still-in-uae}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman claimed Thaksin was travelling on six passports, none of them Thai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thaksin no Cambodian passport |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/143999/thaksin-doesn-t-have-cambodian-passport |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=22 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008 Thaksin obtained a residency permit for [[Germany]]&lt;ref name="NationThird"&gt;{{cite news |title=Germany lifts travel ban on fugitive Thaksin |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2011/07/28/national/Germany-lifts-travel-ban-on-fugitive-Thaksin-30161360.html |newspaper=nationmultimedia.com (Thailand) |date=28 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206075302/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2011/07/28/national/Germany-lifts-travel-ban-on-fugitive-Thaksin-30161360.html |archivedate=6 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was subsequently withdrawn on 28 May 2009 when the German government became aware of the arrangement.

===Songkran unrest===
{{Main article|April 2009 Thai political unrest}}
In mid-April 2009, violent protests of mostly Thaksin-supporters calling themselves the [[National United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship]] (UDD) led to the cancellation of the [[ASEAN]] summit in Pattaya and declaration of a state of emergency in Bangkok. Thaksin had been giving enthusiastic encouragement at UDD rallies via satellite and phone-in link, at one point calling for a "people's revolution", following the suppression of the protests he claimed to have merely been offering "moral support."&lt;ref name="Thaksin on protests in Thailand"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Opposition raises specter of civil war in Thailand |author=Brian McCartan |publisher=World Politics Review |url=http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/article.aspx?id=3691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin supported protests by the [[National United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship|UDD]] against the Abhisit Vejjajiva government, demanding Thaksin be allowed to return free from all the earlier corruption charges.&lt;ref name="Thaksin pitches 'all-out' fight"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bangkok Post"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nationmultimedia.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enews.mcot.net"/&gt; Thaksin denied leading the UDD, claiming he only gave them "moral support."&lt;ref name="Thaksin on protests in Thailand"/&gt;

===Money laundering allegations===
In April 2009, Privy Councilor General [[Pichitr Kullavanijaya]] reported he had been informed by former US ambassador to Thailand [[Ralph L. Boyce]] that Thaksin had laundered 100&amp;nbsp;billion baht (US$2.8&amp;nbsp;billion) through Cayman Island bank accounts to organise the anti-government protests.&lt;ref&gt;Asia Times, [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KD17Ae02.html Smoke, mirrors and lies], 17 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic advisor to Cambodia===
On 4 November 2009, it was announced that Thaksin Shinawatra had been appointed a special advisor to the [[Cambodia]]n government and [[Hun Sen]] and stated that Cambodia would refuse to extradite Thaksin because it considered him a victim of political persecution.

On 5 November 2009, both countries recalled their ambassadors.&lt;ref name="BBC 5-11-09"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai envoy recalled from Cambodia |url=
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8343703.stm|date=5 November 2009 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thai Prime Minister [[Abhisit Vejjajiva]] stated this was "the first diplomatic retaliation measure".&lt;ref name="BBC 5-11-09"/&gt; Stating Cambodia was interfering in Thailand's internal affairs and as a result all bi-lateral co-operation agreements would be reviewed.&lt;ref name="BBC 5-11-09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 5-11-09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 5-11-09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="etaiwan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Recall of envoys escalates Thai-Cambodian tensions |url=

===="Spy" controversy====
On 11 November 2009, [[Sivarak Chutipong]] was arrested by Cambodian police for passing the confidential flight plans of Thaksin and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen to Kamrob Palawatwichai, First Secretary of the Royal Thai Embassy in Cambodia. Sivarak was a Thai engineer working in Cambodia for Cambodia Air Traffic Service, the private firm which manages [[air traffic control]] in Cambodia.&lt;ref name="phnompenhpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2009111329536/Online-Edition/thai-national-arrested-for-espionage.html|title=Search|work=Phnom Penh Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phnompenhpost.com"/&gt; Sivarak denied that he was a spy, and the Thai government claimed that he was innocent and that the incident was a Thaksin/Cambodian plot to further damage relations between the two countries. The Thai First Secretary was expelled from Cambodia. Sivarak demanded that former First Secretary Kamrob speak out and restore his damaged reputation by confirming he was not involved in a spy ring. Kamrob refused to provide comment to the press throughout the controversy, and Kasit's secretary, Chavanond Intarakomalyasut, insisted that although that there was no misconduct on the part of the First Secretary or Sivarak, there would be no statement from Kamrob.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/29256/irate-sivarak-demands-answers|title=Irate Sivarak demands answers - Bangkok Post: news|first=Bangkok Post Public Company|last=Limited|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sivarak's mother appeared often on Thai television, pleading for the government to assist her son.

Sivarak was later sentenced to jail for 7 years. Thaksin personally requested the Cambodian government to pardon Sivarak, and he was soon pardoned by King [[Norodom Sihamoni]] and expatriated. Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban later accused Sivarak of staging his own arrest in order to discredit the Abhisit government.&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/162987/sivarak-mum-may-sue-suthep Sivarak's mum threatens to sue Suthep], 17 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Former Thai spy chief and Foreign Minister [[Prasong Soonsiri]] concurred, claiming, "It has been a set-up from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2009/12/10/politics/politics_30118266.php|title=Mother justifies seeking royal pardon for her son|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617004136/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2009/12/10/politics/politics_30118266.php|archivedate=17 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frozen asset seizure===

====Prior to the verdict====
On 26 February 2010, the Supreme Court was scheduled to render its verdict on whether to seize his family's Thai assets, worth 76&amp;nbsp;billion baht frozen by the AEC after the coup. The AEC froze the assets under the authority of Announcement No. 30 of the military junta.&lt;ref name="AECrationaleforfreeze"/&gt; Tensions ran high through Thailand, tens of thousands of government security forces were deployed, particularly in routes leading to Bangkok. However, the UDD denied that it would rally on the date of the verdict.&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/32952/security-forces-ready-for-action Security forces ready for action], 16 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/168673/udd-won-t-rally-on-feb-26 UDD won't rally on 26 February], 16 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The nine Supreme Court judges had to make a judgment on accusations of abnormal wealth through policy corruption. Policy corruption, was defined by the court as the abuse of powers by implementing economic policies that, while in themselves legal and of potential benefit to society and the economy, also aided companies that were owned in part by the policy maker.&lt;ref name="PolicyCorruption" /&gt; The prosecution claimed that Thaksin abused his powers five times while Premier.

[[File:Judgment-of-the-Supreme-Court-of-Thailand-26022010-firstlastpages.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The first and last pages of the verdict with the signatures of the nine supreme court judges]]

====The verdict====
The court first ruled that Thaksin and Potjaman were the real owners of the assets, rather than his children and relatives. The court also ruled that it had the authority to seize assets, based on the announcements of the junta. The court found Thaksin guilty of four out of five policy corruption, and ordered that 46&amp;nbsp;billion baht be seized. The remaining 30&amp;nbsp;billion continued to remain frozen.
* Count 1: Conversion of telecom concession fees into excise charges. Previously, telecom operators had to pay the TOT/CAT a percentage of their revenue as a concession fee (TOT/CAT are state-owned enterprises, although they were going through the process of privatisation). The Thaksin government modified this into a system wherein all operators would instead directly pay the government an equivalent excise tax. The imposition of excise tax here would eventually be passed on to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/28/politics/Telecom-laws-were-manipulated-to-benefit-Shin-Corp-30123620.html|title=Telecom laws were manipulated to benefit Shin Corp subsidiary AIS, says court|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617004210/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/28/politics/Telecom-laws-were-manipulated-to-benefit-Shin-Corp-30123620.html|archivedate=17 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin claimed that all operators continued to pay the same total costs. The judges ruled that this benefited AIS while harming the TOT, and thus was an abuse of power.
* Count 2: Modification of a revenue sharing agreement on pre-paid mobile services. Previously, telecom operators had to pay the TOT a percentage of their revenues for post-paid mobile services. To offer pre-paid services, which are generally cost less to the consumer, AIS negotiated with TOT to design a revenue sharing agreement for pre-paid services that offered less revenue to the TOT comprising an estimated loss of 14.2&amp;nbsp;billion baht (revenue reduced from 25% to 20%) from 2001 to 2006 and another estimated loss of 56&amp;nbsp;billion baht (revenue reduced from 30% to 20%) from 2006 to 2015.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/28/politics/Minefield-of-criminal-cases-awaits-Thaksin-30123621.html|title=Minefield of criminal cases awaits Thaksin|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302143058/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/28/politics/Minefield-of-criminal-cases-awaits-Thaksin-30123621.html|archivedate=2 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judges ruled that the terms of the pre-paid agreement harmed TOT while benefiting AIS. The judges did not dispute the fact that TOT's total revenue actually increased substantially as a result of the agreement, but noted that the rise in pre-paid revenue came about while harming TOT's post-paid revenue. The massive growth in Thai mobile penetration from 13% in 2001 to 80% in 2007, due almost completely to pre-paid services, and the reduction in AIS market share from 68% to 53% in the same period were not taken into account by the court.
* Count 3: Modification of mobile roaming agreement. Previously, there were no roaming agreements between mobile operators – subscribers from one operator were not allowed to use services on another operator's network, thus limiting the growth of the mobile industry. Under the Thaksin government, roaming was allowed, with roaming fees deducted from the revenue that AIS and other operators had to share with TOT and other state enterprises. Essentially, TOT helped AIS shoulder the costs of its subscribers roaming on the mobile networks of other operators. This reduced TOT and CAT's income while benefiting the operators. However, the judges ruled that it while benefited AIS, it did so to the benefit of AIS's new owners (Temasek Holdings) rather than Thaksin, and hence was not an abuse of power.
* Count 4: Replacement of [[ThaiCom 4]] with [[iPSTAR]]. A previous government had originally contracted with ShinSat to launch and operate ThaiCom 4 as a backup satellite for ThaiCom 3. Instead, ShinSat negotiated with the Thaksin government to launch iPSTAR, at the time the largest commercial satellite in history, which it claimed could offer commercial internet services while also providing backup for ThaiCom 3. However, the claim is not technically possible since iPSTAR does not have C-band transponders as [[ThaiCom 3]]. Shin Corp's ownership in ShinSat was subsequently reduced from 51% to 40%. The judges found that the changes in ownership and satellite specification change reduced Thailand's communications security by not having the backup satellite for ThaiCom 3 on the one-to-one basis. It also noted that the negotiations allowed ShinSat to launch a satellite with much greater commercial potential than ThaiCom 4 without having to bid for a separate concession agreement.
* Count 5: EXIM Bank loan to Myanmar to pay for ThaiCom services. Thaksin was scheduled to meet with Burmese leaders to negotiate trade deals between the two countries. One of the deals negotiated gave Myanmar a Thai EXIM Bank loan to purchase 376&amp;nbsp;million baht in satellite services from ShinSat. Thaksin noted that many deals were struck in the negotiations, and that 16 other companies also benefited from the EXIM Bank's loans. The judges ruled that the loans gave preferential treatment to Thaksin, and hence were an abuse of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/26/politics/Timeline-on-Thaksins-Judgement-Day-30123503.html|title=Thaksin guilty,  Bt46 bn seized, Bt30 bn returned|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301054928/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/26/politics/Timeline-on-Thaksins-Judgement-Day-30123503.html|archivedate=1 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaksinlive.com/2010/02/headlines/722|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225032201/http://www.thaksinlive.com/2010/02/headlines/722|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-02-25|title=Thaksin Shinawatra|work=thaksinlive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The judges decided to seize 46&amp;nbsp;billion differences in value of Shin Corp. shares from the date when he came to office and the value when the shares were sold to Singapore's Temasek Holdings in early 2006. Note that, Thaksin had declared around 500 million baht in assets and Pojaman had 8&amp;nbsp;billion to 9&amp;nbsp;billion baht while Thaksin served as prime minister.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Nevertheless, during that period, Shin shares gained 121%, compared with a 128% gain in the benchmark SET index, while [[Siam Cement]], one of Thailand's premier blue chip companies, gained 717%.&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704625004575088720584763744?mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLETopStories, Thai Court Rules to Seize $1.4&amp;nbsp;Billion From Thaksin], 26 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The judges did not find that Thaksin was guilty of malfeasance. They also noted that any benefit to the government from Thaksin's policies was irrelevant to the ruling. The government reaped approximately 100&amp;nbsp;billion baht in increased revenue from changes in the concession agreements alone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationmultimedia.com%252Foption%252Fprint.php%253Fnewsid%253D30118020&amp;h=7fa87f0939dbf3b20d395d4dea9a35be&amp;ref=mf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aftermath====
In an email to his supporters, Thaksin claimed that the court was used as a tool. He also noted how the Thai stock market rose to the benefit of many companies, not just his, and claimed that all charges against him were politically motivated. He thanked his supporters for not protesting while the verdict was being read, and implored them to use non-violent means in the future. Pojaman na Pombejra insisted that tens of billions of baht of her wealth had been given to her children and relatives well before Thaksin took office in 2001 and denied that her children and relatives were nominees of her and her husband. She also denied having any control over Ample Rich and Win Mark, two firms that the AEC had accused of being her nominees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/10/politics/It&amp;039;s-my-money-Pojaman-30122199.html|title=It's my money : Pojaman|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225141212/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/10/politics/It%26039%3Bs-my-money-Pojaman-30122199.html|archivedate=25 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of Pojaman's claim, Thaksin was the authorised signature for Ample Rich through 2005, making him the only individual authorised to withdraw funds from the company's account until he transferred the authority to his children, four years after he took office in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/03/06/opinion/How-evidence-trapped-Thaksin-30124060.html|title=How evidence trapped Thaksin|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617004539/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/03/06/opinion/How-evidence-trapped-Thaksin-30124060.html|archivedate=17 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some UDD members held a small protest in front of the court, but did not disrupt the ruling as the government had predicted they would. The UDD leaders announced that a large-scale protest was scheduled to be held on 14 March 2010.

On the evening of 27 February (Saturday of a 3-day holiday), [[M67 grenade]]s were thrown from a motorcycle outside three branches of [[Bangkok Bank]]. Nobody was hurt or injured in the attacks. The perpetrators were not caught, and no organisation claimed responsibility for the attacks. Thaksin and the UDD were quick to deny any involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/PM-pleads-for-public-calm-following-several-Bangko-30123642.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303045519/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/PM-pleads-for-public-calm-following-several-Bangko-30123642.html |archivedate=3 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }} PM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/170009/stringent-security-measures-invoked Stringent security measures invoked], 28 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/170025/udd-denies-link-in-bomb-attacks UDD denies link in bomb attacks], 28 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; An arrest warrant was issued based on sketches of a motorcycle driver.&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/170129/warrant-issued-for-bomb-suspect Warrant issued for bomb suspect], 1 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transfer of Shin Corp. Shares===
The laws does not allow the prime minister to run a side business while holding office. Thaksin was pressed charged on wealth concealment while in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Asia/Story/A1Story20091221-187194.html|title=Thaksin assets case verdict due in January|work=asiaone.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2005-Pu-Z/Shinawatra-Thaksin.html|title=Thaksin Shinawatra|work=notablebiographies.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to the wealth declaration of Thaksin and his family when he took office, there has been an appeal to The National Anti-Corruption Commission that there are some suspicions about the numbers in the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokbiznews.com/home/detail/politics/opinion/sarinee-achavanuntak/20100305/103531/%E0%B8%8B%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%B8%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%99-301-:-%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%A5%E0%B9%87%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%82%E0%B8%B1%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B9%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%B6%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%8C-%E0%B8%9E.%E0%B8%95.%E0%B8%97.%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A9%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%93-%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%A3-(1).html|title=กรุงเทพธุรกิจ - เกี่ยวกับกรุงเทพธุรกิจออนไลน์|work=www.bangkokbiznews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transferring to maid and driver====
Thaksin was charged with illegally concealing billions of baht of his wealth by transferring ownership of [[Shin Corporation|Shin Corp.]] shares to his drivers and maids, without their knowledge. Thaksin tearfully told the Constitutional Court that it was an honest mistake before the Court acquitted him on the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnngo.com/bangkok/none/thaksins-political-roller-coaster-887576|title=Thaksin court drama grips Bangkok|work=CNN Travel|access-date=27 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504192344/http://www.cnngo.com/bangkok/none/thaksins-political-roller-coaster-887576|archive-date=4 May 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transferring shares to children who reached maturity====
There was also a controversy over whether there was any hidden tax evasion when Thaksin and Potjaman transferred their Shin Corporation shares to their children. [[Panthongtae Shinawatra|Panthongtae]] and Pinthongta Shinawatra were accused of being nominees of their parent.

The transfer of shares from Thaksin and Potjaman to Parnthongtae was claimed to have been a sham, since there was no actual transfer of money. Panthongtae said the shares were sold to him at cost. Thaksin stated he had a written agreement proving the transfer to his son. Prior to the transfer, Panthongtae had signed an agreement with his father to settle a 4.5 billion baht debt from buying 300 million shares of the [[TMB Bank|Thai Military Bank]] (TMB). However, the actual market value of the TMB shares at that time was only 1.5 billion baht. This showed a "fake debt" of 3 billion baht had been created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/03/01/columnists/Door-now-open-for-more-agencies-to-reclaim-their-m-30123674.html|title=Door now open for more agencies to reclaim their money|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304132514/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/03/01/columnists/Door-now-open-for-more-agencies-to-reclaim-their-m-30123674.html|archivedate=4 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Assets Examination Committee (Thailand)|The Assets Examination Committee]] (AEC) discovered that Panthongtae's account that receives Shin Corporation's dividend has been used to transfer money to Potjaman's account to the amount of 1.1 billion baht.

Pintongtha also was accused of being nominee for her parents. She said that the money from her mother was a "birthday present". This birthday present was used to buy 367 million shares of Shin Corporation, which leaves her brother with the same amount. The AEC found the account has been receiving dividends from Shin Corp. There were no transactions between Pintongtha's account and her mother's account. However, the dividend money was used to buy SC Asset shares from WinMark to the amount of 71 million baht and shares from 5 real-estate firms from 2 funds in 2004 worth of 485 million baht.

DSI, AEC, and Securities and Exchange Commission discovered that both WinMark and the two funds are owned by Thaksin and his former wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Potjaman insists family assets of B76bn were legally earned |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/23916/potjaman-insists-family-assets-of-b76bn-were-legally-earned |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=16 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Devil's Miner''''' is a 2005 [[documentary film]] directed by independent film directors Kief Davidson and Richard Ladkani. The film follows a fourteen-year-old [[Bolivia]]n boy named Basilio Vargas who along with his twelve-year-old brother Bernardino work in the mines near the city of [[Potosí]]. The film includes many subtle realities of the miner's lives such as the need to chew coca leaves to numb the pain of hunger and the long shifts they work regardless of age.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.netflix.com/Movie/The-Devil-s-Miner/70043419&lt;/ref&gt; The film made its world premier at the [[International Film Festival Rotterdam|Rotterdam film festival]] and its U.S. debut at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]].

The film concentrates on the concerns of local workers who have fear of what they call “Tio” or [[devil]]. In the film, an elder miner claims that over 8 million people have died in the unsafe mines. The workers believe this is because “Tio” controls the mine and that [[Christ]] has no power in the mine. The workers often give [[wikt:offering|offering]]s such as coca leaves, alcohol, cigarettes and perform [[sacrifices]], such as slaughtering a llama and applying its blood to the mine entrance to appease a makeshift statue of "Tio". Each mine has its own Tio which all of the workers pray to upon entering so that they may find a good vein of silver and so that they may be granted protection from explosions, toxic gas, silicosis, and falling rocks.The local [[Catholic]] priest is unable to tame these fears of “Tio” although the workers often pray at the [[Church (building)|church]] before entering the mine,upon observing the miners attending Mass, the local priest said that when he looked into the face of the miners he "saw Christ dying". The irony which is upon these people is one of great sorrow. They worship both God and the Devil, Light and Dark, The God of the world, and the god of the earthen mine below. 

As of 2014, Basilio is studying tourism, working in the mines three nights a week, and working as a tour guide in the mines. Bernardino, now married, still works in the mines full-time whilst studying in the evenings. The boys no longer live on the mountain, however their mother remains in the same house.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/devilsminer/update.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trademark distinctiveness''' is an important concept in the law governing [[trademark]]s and [[service mark]]s. A trademark may be eligible for registration, or '''registrable''', if it performs the essential trademark function, and has '''distinctive character'''. Registrability can be understood as a continuum, with "inherently distinctive" marks at one end, "generic" and "descriptive" marks with no distinctive character at the other end, and "suggestive" and "arbitrary" marks lying between these two points. "Descriptive" marks must acquire distinctiveness through secondary meaning - consumers have come to recognize the mark as a source indicator - to be protectable. "Generic" terms are used to refer to the product or service itself and cannot be used as trademarks.

==The spectrum of distinctiveness==

In [[United States trademark law]], [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World]] 537 F.2d 4 (2nd Cir. 1976) established the [[spectrum]] of trademark distinctiveness in the US, breaking trademarks into classes which are accorded differing degrees of protection. Courts often speak of marks falling along the following "'''spectrum of distinctiveness'''," also known within the US as the "[[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch|Abercrombie]] classification" or "[[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch|Abercrombie]] factors":&lt;ref&gt;''[[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World]]'' 537 F.2d 4 (2nd Cir. 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inta.org/TrademarkBasics/FactSheets/Pages/TrademarksvsGenericTermsFactSheet.aspx |publisher=[[International Trademark Association]] |title=Trademarks vs. Generic Terms |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/a/abercrombie-classification |title=Abercrombie Classification Law &amp; Legal Definition |publisher=US Legal, Inc. |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fanciful marks===
A '''fanciful''' / '''inherently distinctive''' trademark is [[prima facie]] registrable, and comprises an entirely invented or "fanciful" sign. For example, "[[Kodak]]" had no meaning before it was adopted and used as a trademark in relation to goods, whether photographic goods or otherwise. Invented marks are [[neologism]]s which will not previously have been found in any [[dictionary]].

===Arbitrary marks===
An '''arbitrary''' trademark is usually a common word which is used in a meaningless context (e.g. "[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]" for computers). Such marks consist of words or images which have some dictionary meaning before being adopted as trademarks, but which are used in connection with products or services unrelated to that dictionary meaning. Arbitrary marks are also immediately eligible for registration. ''Salty'' would be an arbitrary mark if it used in connection with e.g. telephones such as in ''Salty Telephones'', as the term "[[salt]]" has no particular connection with such products.

===Suggestive marks===
A '''suggestive''' trademark tends to indicate the nature, quality, or a characteristic of the products or services in relation to which it is used, but does not describe this characteristic, and requires imagination on the part of the consumer to identify the characteristic. Suggestive marks invoke the consumer’s perceptive imagination. An example of a suggestive mark is [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]], a new technology of high-capacity data storage that utilizes a "blue" (actually [[Violet (color)|violet]]) [[laser]].

===Descriptive marks===
A '''descriptive''' mark is a term with a dictionary meaning which is used in connection with products or services directly related to that meaning. An example might be ''Salty'' used in connection with saltine crackers or anchovies. Such terms are not registrable unless it can be shown that distinctive character has been established in the term through extensive use in the [[marketplace]] (see further below). [[Lektronic]] was famously refused protection by the USPTO on the grounds of being descriptive for electronic goods.

===Generic terms===
{{Redirect|Generic term}}
A '''generic term''' is the common name for the products or services in connection with which it is used, such as "salt" when used in connection with sodium chloride. A generic term is not capable of serving the essential trademark function of distinguishing the products or services of a business from the products or services of other businesses, and therefore cannot be afforded any legal protection. This is because there has to be some term which may generally be used by anyone—including other manufacturers—to refer to a product without using some organization's proprietary trademark. Marks which become generic after losing distinctive character are known as [[genericized trademark]]s. Marks which are a misspelling of a generic term (e.g., the elimination of a space) do not change the generic significance of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/foia/ttab/other/2005/76219917.pdf|title= In re NetEnterprise, Inc., Serial No. 76219917|work=USPTO|language=en|date=2005-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thettablog.blogspot.com/2005/05/netenterprise-generic-for-internet.html|title='NETENTERPRISE' Generic For An Internet Business, Says TTAB|work=TTABlog|language=en|date=2005-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessing distinctiveness==
In trademark litigation, courts are most frequently asked to distinguish between ''suggestive'' and ''descriptive'' marks on the one hand, and between ''descriptive'' and ''generic'' marks on the other. This is because suggestive marks, like fanciful and arbitrary marks, are presumed to be entitled to trademark protection, while descriptive marks are entitled to protection if they have become known as representing the producer of the goods, and generic marks can never receive protection. It can be seen from the examples above that the distinctive character of a term is closely related to the products or services in relation to which the term is used.

A general method for assessing the distinctive character of a mark is to consider a consumer's reaction to a mark. The mark may only be inherently registrable if the consumer has never encountered the mark before. On the other hand, the mark is unlikely to be inherently registrable if it informs him about any characteristic of the relevant products or services (e.g. whether they are delicious, large, spicy, black, or sweet, in the case of fruit). In any other case the mark may not be registrable.

Another example of a descriptive mark would be a geographical word or phrase that merely indicates the origin of the product or service. For example, [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] based [[ice cream]] might find that the name "Houston ice cream" is denied trademark protection on the grounds that the word Houston is merely descriptive. However, they might have better luck with the name "North Pole ice cream". In the latter case, although North Pole is a geographical location, the ice cream is not actually made at the [[North Pole]], and no reasonable person would assume that the phrase North Pole is literally descriptive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.findlaw.com/12international/countries/nz/articles/482.html| publisher= Findlaw|title=Trading on a good name| first=Baldwin Shelston| last= Waters|author2=Angela Sutton |date=July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore marks that identify or describe a product or service, or that are in common use, or that are used as [[geographical indication]]s, generally cannot be registered as trademarks, and remain in the [[public domain]] for use by anyone. For example, a generic term such as "apple", or descriptive terms such as "red" or "juicy" could not be registered in relation to apples.

Primary consideration in the selection and use of trademarks should be given to marks which are inherently distinctive, as they possess the strongest distinctive character and do not require evidence of use to establish acquired distinctiveness. A fanciful, arbitrary, or suggestive term can be inherently distinctive and registrable without proof of acquired distinctiveness.
Although these categories are most easily applied in relation to trademarks comprising words, the same general principles are applied in relation to all kinds of trademarks. For example, a pine tree shape is descriptive when used on pine-scented products.

===Acquired distinctiveness===
A trademark with no distinctive character (i.e. a mark which is not inherently distinctive) is [[prima facie]] unregistrable. However, most jurisdictions may still allow such marks to be registered if the trademark owner can demonstrate, typically by reference to '''evidence of use''', that consumers in the marketplace exclusively associate the mark, as used on the identified goods or in connection with the identified services, with a particular commercial origin or source (i.e. the trademark owner). "Use" may include authorized use by a licensee or other party. If the trade marks office is satisfied that the evidence demonstrates that a mark has "acquired" distinctive character ''as a [[de facto|matter of fact]]'', then the mark may be accepted for registration on the basis of '''acquired distinctiveness'''.

The nature and extent of acceptable evidence of use varies between jurisdictions, although the most useful evidence usually includes sales figures, details of advertising and promotional expenditure, and examples of promotional material. Consumer surveys may also help establish that consumers chiefly associate an otherwise non-distinctive mark with the trademark owner and its products or services. Generally, evidence of use may only be acceptable or relevant if it covers a certain period of time (e.g. three years prior to the filing date of the trademark application) and originates from within the jurisdiction where registration is sought.

The terminology of acquired distinctiveness is accepted in the [[European Union]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions such as [[Australia]], [[Hong Kong]] and the [[United Kingdom]], and the common law jurisdiction of the [[United States]] (which also uses the term '''secondary meaning'''). In the U.S., if a trademark has been used for a continuous period of at least five years after the date of registration, the right to use the mark and the registration may become "incontestable" (e.g. invulnerable to cancellation for non-use, but not for becoming [[Genericized trademark|generic]]). In such cases the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|USPTO]] checks and confirms whether the request for incontestability meets formality requirements, but whether a registration is incontestable at law can only be determined during legal proceedings involving the registration.

The essential function of a trademark is to exclusively identify the commercial source or origin of products or services, such that a trademark, properly called, indicates source or serves as a badge of origin. The use of a trademark in this way is known as trademark use. Certain exclusive rights attach to a registered mark, which can be enforced by way of an action for trademark infringement, while unregistered trademark rights may be enforced pursuant to the common law tort of passing off.

It should be noted that trademark rights generally arise out of the use and/or registration (see below) of a mark in connection only with a specific type or range of products or services. Although it may sometimes be possible to take legal action to prevent the use of a mark in relation to products or services outside this range (e.g. for passing off), this does not mean that trademark law prevents the use of that mark by the general public. A common word, phrase, or other sign can only be removed from the public domain to the extent that a trademark owner is able to maintain exclusive rights over that sign in relation to certain products or services, assuming there are no other trademark objections. For a case study in both concepts, see Apple Corps and its disputes with Apple, Inc.

===Maintaining distinctiveness===
If a court rules that a trademark has become "[[genericized trademark|generic]]" through common use (such that the mark no longer performs the essential trademark function and the average consumer no longer considers that exclusive rights attach to it), the corresponding registration may also be ruled invalid.

For example, the [[Bayer]] company's trademark "[[Aspirin]]" has been ruled generic in the United States, so other companies may use that name for [[acetylsalicylic acid]] as well (although it is still a trademark in [[Canada]]). [[Xerox]] for photocopiers and [[Band-Aid]] for adhesive bandages are both trademarks which are at risk of succumbing to death by becoming declared generic in certain countries, something that the respective trademark owners actively seek to prevent. In order to prevent marks becoming generic, trademark owners often contact those who appear to be using the trademark incorrectly, from web page authors to dictionary editors, and request that they cease the improper usage.

The proper use of a trademark means using the mark as an [[adjective]], not as a [[noun]] or a [[verb]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.inta.org/index.php?option=com_simplefaq&amp;task=display&amp;Itemid=60&amp;catid=284&amp;page=1&amp;getcontent=1#FAQ75| publisher=[[International Trademark Association]]| title= How Do I Use a Trademark Properly?| work=Information and Publishing FAQ| accessdate=2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.3com.com/corpinfo/en_US/legal/trademark/prop_usage_tmb.html#1| title=Always Use a Trademark as an Adjective, Followed by the Appropriate Noun Descriptor(s)| publisher=3Com Legal| work=Trademarks and Brands| accessdate=2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.adobe.com/misc/trade.html| title=Permissions and trademark guidelines| publisher=Adobe| accessdate=2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000943.html | title=A Guide to Proper Trademark Use | author=Pullum, Geoffrey K.  | accessdate=2006-12-05 | work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though for certain trademarks, use as nouns and, less commonly, verbs is common. For example, [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] sent e-mails to many web authors using the term "[[photoshopped]]" telling them that they should only use the term "modified by Adobe® Photoshop® software."  Xerox has also purchased print advertisements declaring that "you cannot 'xerox' a document, but you can copy it on a Xerox Brand copying on machine." Another popular example is the use of the word "[[frappuccino]]" by [[Starbucks]] customers to mean any blended coffee beverage, though employees are instructed to only say "frappuccino blended coffee" or "frappuccino blended cream" when referring to such drinks. This rule is not hard-and-fast, however; for example, Lexis-Nexis has a U.S. trademark registration for "Shepardize," [http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=74120780 Reg. No. 1743711], and defines "Shepardizing on a [http://www.lexisnexis.com/infopro/zimmerman/disp.aspx?z=1930 web page] as "the process of looking up citations" in "a series of books called Shepard's Citations."  Such efforts may or may not be successful in preventing genericism in the long run, which depends less on the mark owner's efforts and more on how the public actually perceives and uses the mark. In fact, legally it is more important that the trademark holder visibly and actively seems to attempt to prevent its trademark from becoming generic, regardless of real success.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

[[File:CNBC Wake Up Call at NASDAQ MarketSite.jpg|thumb|''Wake Up Call'' at NASDAQ MarketSite]]

'''''Wake Up Call''''' is an American television business news program that aired on [[CNBC]] in the early morning. The program premiered in the 6 to 8&amp;nbsp;am timeslot ET on February&amp;nbsp;4, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ilook.tw/9goc2 YouTube Video]&lt;/ref&gt; Later it was moved to 5 to 7&amp;nbsp;am timeslot. The previous program shown in the same time slot on CNBC was ''[[Today's Business]]''. The program ended its run on December&amp;nbsp;16, 2005 and was replaced by ''[[Worldwide Exchange]]'' on December&amp;nbsp;19.

==Overview==
Originally co-anchored by [[Liz Claman]] and [[Carl Quintanilla]] (see complete anchor listing below), ''Wake Up Call'' was subsequently hosted by [[Michelle Caruso-Cabrera]], sometimes in conjunction with a guest host.  The program used a slightly different graphics package to other CNBC program; in particular, a different format for the ticker.

''[[Today's Business (CNBC Europe)|Today's Business]]'' was the equivalent program on [[CNBC Europe]] and used the same theme music as ''Wake Up Call''.  That program, which was hosted by [[Steve Sedgwick]], ended its run on March&amp;nbsp;23, 2007 and replaced by ''[[Capital Connection]]'' on March&amp;nbsp;26, 2007.

There was also a program on [[CNBC Asia]] called ''[[Asia Wake Up Call]]''.  It merged with ''[[Asia Squawk Box]]'' in 2003.

'''Sir William Alfred "Alf" Stevenson''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|KBE|CStJ|size=85%}} (19 May 1901 – 29 November 1983) was a New Zealand [[industrialist]], [[philanthropist]] and local-body politician. He was also active in rowing, both as a competitor and official, and was a noted [[Big-game fishing|big-game fisherman]].

==Biography==
Stevenson was born in 1901, the son of Laura (née Paterson) and William Stevenson, who in 1913 founded the company that would grow into the Stevenson Group.

He was educated at [[Albany, New Zealand|Albany]] Primary School on Auckland's [[North Shore City|North Shore]] and began working as a carpenter for his father.&lt;ref name="Howick mourns"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.times.co.nz/1983/howick-mourns.html | title=Howick mourns | date=19 July 2012 | work=Times Online | accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 the business expanded into construction. Stevenson took over after his father became ill, and later his sons William and Jim became involved, the company eventually becoming a major contracting firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stevenson, William Alfred|url=http://www.businesshalloffame.co.nz/stevenson-william-alfred/|publisher=New Zealand Business Hall of Fame|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NBR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/family-stevenson |title=Stevenson family |year=2014 |website= |publisher=National Business Review |accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as chairman of the [[Howick, New Zealand|Howick]] Town Board from 1944 to 1947, and was the second mayor of Howick, following its inauguration as a borough, from 1953 to 1962.&lt;ref name="Howick mourns"/&gt;

Stevenson won New Zealand single and double sculls rowing titles between 1923 and 1926. Later, he managed the rowing camp at [[Lake Karapiro]] for the [[1950 British Empire Games]], coached and managed the New Zealand rowing team to the [[1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]] in Vancouver, and was manager of the New Zealand rowing team at the [[New Zealand at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo.&lt;ref name="Howick mourns"/&gt;

A keen fisherman, Stevenson was a member of the [[Mercury Bay]] Game Fishing Club,&lt;ref name="Mercury"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mbgfc.co.nz/Dynamic.aspx?id=1200 |title=History |date= |website= |publisher=Mercury Bay Game Fishing Club |accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first person in the world to catch a tuna, marlin and shark each weighing more than {{convert|1000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Howick mourns"/&gt; He held the Australasian record for a [[black marlin]], caught off [[Cairns]], with a weight of {{convert|1231|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Mercury"/&gt; A horse breeder and owner, Stevenson enjoyed success with his horse [[Jandell]],&lt;ref name="Howick mourns"/&gt; whose wins included the 1973 [[Avondale Guineas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ajc.co.nz/avondaleguineas.php |title=Previous winners of the Avondale Guineas |date= |website= |publisher=Avondale Jockey Club |accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1975 [[Queen Elizabeth Stakes (ATC)|Queen Elizabeth Stakes]] at [[Randwick Racecourse|Randwick]] in [[Sydney]], beating champion mare [[Leilani (horse)|Leilani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/horseracing/wood-trots-up-a-rare-treat-20121206-2axpo.html | title=Wood trots up a rare treat | date=7 December 2012 | work=Sydney Morning Herald | accessdate=19 January 2015 | first=Max | last=Presnell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Stevenson purchased the {{convert|13800|ha|acres|abbr=on}} Lochinvar Station on the Rangitaiki Plains between [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]] and [[Taupo]], and transformed it into a productive farming operation with a carrying capacity of over 100,000 stock units.&lt;ref name="NBR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11168326 | title=Record price expected for rural property | date=6 December 2013| work=New Zealand Herald | accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a philanthropist, Stevenson supported many causes and charities, and was particularly interested in the medical area, donating to various hospitals, [[St. John Ambulance]], and endowing chairs in orthopaedic surgery and ophthamology and an associate professorship in plastic surgery at the [[University of Auckland]].&lt;ref name="Howick mourns"/&gt;

In the [[1954 New Year Honours]], Stevenson was appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] for services to the community,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=40055 |date=1 January 1954 |page=44 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was promoted to Knight Commander of the same order in the [[1965 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=43531 |date=1 January 1965 |page=43 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed a [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Commander of the Order of St John]] in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=42722 |date=3 July 1962 |page=5306 }}&lt;/ref&gt; made an honorary member of the [[Royal Australasian College of Surgeons]] in 1975,&lt;ref name="Howick mourns"/&gt; and, in 1978, awarded an honorary [[Doctor of Science|DSc]] by the University of Auckland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=University of Auckland Calendar 1982 |url=http://www.calendar.auckland.ac.nz/archive/1982-calendar.pdf |accessdate=19 January 2015 |page=43 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219072826/http://www.calendar.auckland.ac.nz/archive/1982-calendar.pdf |archivedate=19 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''José Roberto "Zero" Alves Freitas'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pron|first1=Patricio|title=Acumulación|trans-title=Accumulation|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/04/01/eps/1427893826_250933.html|accessdate=13 April 2015|work=El País|date=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born {{circa|1955}}) is a Brazilian businessman whose [[Record collecting|record collection]] of over eight million discs is said to be the largest in existence. In addition, he has more than 100,000 compact discs.

==Early life==
Freitas was born around 1955, and acquired the nickname "Zero" at school.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-31874121 Building the world's biggest record collection.] ''[[BBC News]]'', 16 March 2015. Retrieved 28 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was a child, his father bought a [[hi-fi]] stereo that came with 200 albums, thus kindling Freitas's interest in the area. The collection was damaged in a flood and Freitas later recreated it.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/magazine/the-brazilian-bus-magnate-whos-buying-up-all-the-worlds-vinyl-records.html The Brazilian Bus Magnate Who’s Buying Up All the World's Vinyl Records.] [[Monte Reel]], ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', 8 August 2014. Retrieved 27 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, who had a collection of 400–500 records, also influenced Freitas.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; The first record he bought was ''Canta para a Juventude'' by [[Roberto Carlos (singer)|Roberto Carlos]], which he acquired around December 1964 or January 1965. By the time Freitas left high school he had 3,000 records.&lt;ref name=guard&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/27/record-collector-zero-freitas-worlds-largest-vinyl-hoard? Record collector builds world's largest vinyl hoard – six million and counting.] Jonathan Watts, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 27 March 2015. Retrieved 27 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Freitas studied music composition at college then took over the family transport business which ran buses in the city of [[São Paulo]]. By the time he was 30, Freitas had acquired about 25–30,000 records.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

==Expansion==
Until recently, most of Freitas's buying was anonymous. He placed adverts in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine reading "RECORD COLLECTIONS. We BUY any record collection. Any style of music. We pay HIGHER prices than anyone else." and used agents to act on his behalf. He bought the remaining stock of 200,000 records from [[Colony Records]] in New York's [[Times Square]] after the store's 2012 closure and bought the stock of the Rio de Janeiro's Modern Sound store around the same time. Around 2013 he bought the collection of [[Murray Gershenz]], the former proprietor of the Music Man Murray record shop in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Also in 2013, Freitas bought the collection of Paul Mawhinney of [[Record-Rama]], once itself thought to be the largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2003/04/28/story6.html Failed deals for fabled musical archive strike sour note with owner.] Tim Schooley, ''[[Pittsburgh Business Times]]'', 28 April 2003. Retrieved 31 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of around three million records took eight [[Semitrailer|semitrailers]] to move.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Publicity==
The extent of Freitas's collection was first revealed to the world after details were published in an article in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' in August 2014. At that time he was estimated to have "several million" records.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; By March 2015, his collection was estimated at six million, making his the largest record collection in existence.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; Freitas was unable to explain why he continues to acquire so many records, saying "I’ve gone to therapy for 40 years to try to explain this to myself".&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He collects 33, 45 and 78 rpm records of any style of music or speech. The records are cleaned and cataloged by a team of assistants that he has recruited but he is acquiring new material faster than they can work and only 250,000 records have been processed so far. He keeps 100,000 records at home.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; The collection includes many rareties such as "Heartache Souvenirs"/"Chicken Shack," by William Powell but it also includes up to 30% duplication. Those duplicates are now beginning to be sold off.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Ten thousand Brazilian records were given to the [[ARChive of Contemporary Music]] where they form the Zero Freitas Brazilian Music Collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arcmusic.org/catalogs/special-collections/ Special Collections.] ARChive of Contemporary Music. Retrieved 28 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Freitas has become well known, collectors have begun to offer him their collections. In October 2014 alone he acquired one million records from another collector for 200,000 reais. In 2015, Terence McEwan of the [[San Francisco Opera]] gave Freitas 6,500 classical LPs.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; Freitas continues to maintain agents around the world, including in Mexico, New York and Nigeria. These enable him to buy a diverse range of material such as the collection of the late [[Bob Hope]] and the 100,000 albums of Cuban music he has acquired. His staff joke that the island of Cuba must be rising due to the weight of material that Freitas has removed.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Future plans==
Freitas is building a warehouse to store his collection which he plans to call the Emporium Musical.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Business activities==
In addition to transport, Freitas runs a business providing audio-visual systems for concerts and other public events.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;
