The '''Juba talks''' were a series of negotiations between the government of [[Uganda]] and the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] rebel group over the terms of a ceasefire and possible peace agreement.  The talks, held in [[Juba, Sudan|Juba]], the capital of autonomous [[Southern Sudan]], began in July 2006 and were mediated by [[Riek Machar]], the Vice President of Southern Sudan.  The talks, which had resulted in a ceasefire by September 2006, were described as the best chance ever for a negotiated settlement to the 20-year-old war.&lt;ref name=BBC_deadline&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4790049.stm Uganda hopeful about rebel talks], BBC News, 14 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; However, LRA leader [[Joseph Kony]] refused to sign the peace agreement in April 2008.  Two months later, the LRA carried out an attack on a Southern Sudanese town, prompting the Government of Southern Sudan to officially withdraw from their mediation role.

==Preparations==
A delegation from the LRA arrived in [[Juba, Sudan]] on 8 June 2006 to prepare for talks with the Ugandan government, to be mediated by the [[Southern Sudan autonomous region (2005–2011)|Government of Southern Sudan]] &lt;ref name="juba_8_june"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5060666.stm LRA rebels arrive for Sudan talks], BBC News, 8 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Community of Sant'Egidio]].&lt;ref name="Sant'Egidio"&gt;{{it icon}}[http://santegidio.de/news/rassegna/2006/0820_004061_IT.htm "Guerra in Nord Uganda: la fine è a portata di mano"], [[Avvenire]], August 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  These talks were agreed to after Kony released a video in May in which he denied committing atrocities and seemed to call for an end to hostilities, in response to an announcement by Museveni that he would guarantee the safety of Kony if peace was agreed to by July. Museveni had pledged to grant Kony total amnesty if he gave up "[[terrorism]]". Uganda's security minister [[Amama Mbabazi]] urged the [[International Criminal Court]] to drop the indictments issued in 2005 against leaders of the LRA, but LRA legal adviser [[Krispus Ayena Odongo]] rejected the offer, saying that accepting amnesty "presupposes surrender" and would mean the LRA was no longer available for discussions.&lt;ref name="amnesty_rejection"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5157220.stm Uganda LRA rebels reject amnesty], [[BBC News]], 7 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="drop_charges"&gt;[http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_1966651,00.html ICC urged to drop LRA charges] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229135255/http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_1966651,00.html |date=2008-02-29 }}, [[BBC News]], 12 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Several organizations, including the ICC&lt;ref name="amnesty_offer"&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200607060715.html Museveni Amnesty to Kony Illegal - ICC], AllAfrica (The Monitor), 6 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Bar Association]]'s Human Rights Institute&lt;ref name="IBA_rejects_amnesty"&gt;[http://www.legalbrief.co.za/filemgmt/visit.php?lid=401 IBA says Ugandan Government must meet obligations under the Rome Statute], IBA News Release, 13 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; insisted that LRA leaders must be arrested in accordance with the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]]. 

[[Joseph Kony]] gave his first interview to the press after 20 years of carrying out the conflict in late June 2006. He denied that the LRA had carried out any atrocities and blamed President Museveni for oppressing the Acholi.&lt;ref name="kony_speaks"&gt;Sam Farmar, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/5124762.stm Uganda rebel leader breaks silence], BBC [[Newsnight]], 28 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless, in late June 2006, the Government of Southern Sudan formally invited Uganda to attend peace talks.&lt;ref name="sudan_invitation"&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=54279 UGANDA: Gov't to send team to Sudan over proposed LRA talks], IRIN, 28 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial negotiations==
On 14 July 2006 talks began in Juba between delegations from the LRA and Uganda, with the Vice-president of Southern Sudan [[Riek Machar]] as the chief mediator. The leader of the Ugandan delegation, Internal Affairs Minister [[Ruhakana Rugunda]] stated that his priority was to obtain a quick ceasefire.&lt;ref name="Rugunda_comment"&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200607140756.html Ceasefire First On Kony Agenda], AllAfrica (The Monitor), 15 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The LRA delegation, led by [[Martin Ojul]], said that LRA's acceptance of the peace talks should not be interpreted that LRA can no longer fight, but stressed that a negotiated settlement is the best way to end the conflict.&lt;ref name="Ojul_speech"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070401151418/http://www.sundayvision.co.ug/detail.php?mainNewsCategoryId=7&amp;newsCategoryId=132&amp;newsId=509505 Opening speech of LRA delegation at Juba talks], Sunday Vision, 15 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial delegation was criticized as largely consisting of expatriate Acholi, rather than members of the fighting force. However, after many delays [[Vincent Otti]] arrived for meetings on the 29th,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5227526.stm Key Uganda rebel 'attends talks'], BBC News, 29 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; followed the next day by Kony's 14-year-old son [[Salim Saleh Kony]] (sharing a name with brother of President Museveni, [[Salim Saleh]]).&lt;ref name="BBC meet"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5231042.stm Uganda officials 'meet LRA chief'], BBC News, 30 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Kony himself met with local religious and political leaders from northern Uganda and southern Sudan on the following day.&lt;ref name="BBC meet"/&gt;  On 2 August, Kony held his first ever press conference in which he demanded a ceasefire before LRA-government negotiations resumed on the 7th and denied ever abducting children. Some media sources noted that, of the approximately 80 LRA fighters surrounding the press venue, several appeared to be in their early teens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=54938 UGANDA: Government, rebels to resume talks in Sudan], IRIN, 2 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/archives/2006/08/rb_06_aug_16.html Video footage of peace talks in Juba, plus snippet of Kony press conference] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017135801/http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/archives/2006/08/rb_06_aug_16.html |date=2006-10-17 }}, video and commentary by Ruud Elmendorp presented on [[Rocketboom]], 16 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The broader context of the talks remained confused. The government of Southern Sudan views the talks as a means of ridding itself of a foreign army that is complicating their delicate relationship with the [[Khartoum]] government. The request by the Ugandan Government for ICC to suspend war crimes indictments against leaders of the LRA, condemned by international human rights groups but largely supported by leaders and civilians within northern Uganda, led some political analysts to see Ugandan Government's request as a ploy to gain local support.  The comment of a George Olara, an [[Internally displaced person|IDP]] living in a camp in [[Pader District|Pader]], was fairly typical: "He [Kony] should not be taken to [[The Hague]]. Let him come back and live with the community because this is how reconciliation will be achieved. ... [[Peace]] will come if the talks succeed, but there is the potential that they may also fail like they have done before".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=54920 UGANDA: Locals want rebel leader forgiven], IRIN, 1 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceasefire==
[[Image:Scharq al-Istiwa'iya.PNG|thumb|left|[[Owiny Ki-Bul]] is in [[East Equatoria]] (in red) bordering [[Uganda]] to the south, [[Kenya]] to the southeast and [[Ethiopia]] to the east.]]

On 4 August 2006, Vincent Otti declared a unilateral ceasefire and asked the Ugandan government to reciprocate. Ugandan Internal Affairs Minister [[Ruhakana Rugunda]] stated that they were waiting to see the effect on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5243038.stm LRA leaders declare ceasefire], BBC, 4 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  ICC indictee Raska Lukwiya was killed in battle on 12 August 2006; the LRA asked for three days of mourning though a spokesman said that talks would continue.&lt;ref name=BBC_deadline/&gt;  Ugandan President Museveni set a 12 September 2006 deadline to finalize a peace deal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5264742.stm Uganda resumes talks with rebels] ''BBC News'' 18 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The government and LRA signed a truce on 26 August 2006.  Under the terms of the agreement, LRA forces were required to leave Uganda and gather in two assembly areas, where the Ugandan government promised they would not attack and the government of Southern Sudan guaranteed their safety. Once this is accomplished, talks on a comprehensive peace agreement would begin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5288776.stm Uganda and LRA rebels sign truce], BBC News, 26 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Although a final agreement was not reached by the 12 August deadline, LRA rebels began gathering in the assembly areas and the government delegation stated that they would not hold to the deadline.  Machar stated that several hundred rebels, including Otti, had gathered either at [[Ri-Kwangba]] in [[West Equatoria]] or [[Owiny Ki-Bul]] in [[East Equatoria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5337888.stm Uganda drops peace talks deadline], BBC, 12 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kitgum IDP camp from the air, Uganda.jpg|thumb|Huts in the [[Kitgum]] IDP camp are tightly packed together]]

The government also began a process of creating "satellite camps" to decongest the main IDP camps.  In Pader, 28 satellite sites were occupied out of 48 identified as of late September 2006, while the numbers in [[Kitgum]] were 21 of 36.  IDPs farther south in [[Teso sub-region|Teso]] and [[Lango sub-region|Lango]] were being encouraged to return home directly.  However, talks continued to be delayed.  On 23 September, the LRA delegation threatened to walk out of the negotiations, claiming that the UPDF had attacked their forces at Owiny Ki-Bul and demanding that composition of the government delegation be changed and that the ICC warrants be voided before any agreement.  Uganda denied the accusation of attacks.  Both delegations met with mediator Riek Machar on 25 September 2006, but not with each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=55722 UGANDA: Most rebels have left northern Uganda for Sudan - army], IRIN, 26 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks===
The negotiations were paused in early October while a Cessation of Hostilities monitoring team was sent to Owiny Ki-Bul.  The team found that no attack had taken place, but that the LRA had simply moved away from the designated site.  The team recommended that the LRA rebels regroup at Owiny Ki-Bul, while stating that the LRA had not honored the agreement and was using hostile propaganda, that the UPDF was located close to the assembly points and that the mediators had failed to provide armed guards for the assembled rebels.  On 11 October 2006, the LRA proposed that Uganda adopt a [[federalism|federalist]] structure, prompting criticism from the government spokesperson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=55906 UGANDA: Rebels propose federalist solution at Juba talks], [[IRIN]], 11 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 October 2006, Ugandan President [[Yoweri Museveni]] traveled to Juba to meet the LRA negotiators face-to-face for the first time in an attempt to revive the talks, described as "stalled" by ''[[BBC News]]'' and "faltering" by ''[[The Monitor (Uganda)|The Monitor]]'' newspaper.  A Uganda government source reported that the president spoke angrily and rebuked the LRA team several times, before later referring to the LRA as "unserious" in a subsequent address to South Sudan government officials.  A pall had been thrown over the talks by the murder of several dozen civilians, including the shooting of women and children in the head, near Juba during the two previous days.  The attacks were carried out by an as-yet unnamed group, but some suspected that the LRA was responsible for the mayhem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6072994.stm "LRA rebels meet Uganda's Museveni"], BBC News, 21 October 2006; [http://irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=56019 "SUDAN: Armed group kills 42 civilians"], ''IRIN'', 20 October 2006; and [http://www.monitor.co.ug/sunday/news/news10227.php "Museveni meets LRA face to face"]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[The Monitor (Uganda)|The Sunday Monitor]]'', 21 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

After a week-long impasse, the LRA and government signed a second truce on 1 November 2006 that mandated the monitoring team until 1 December. The previous agreement had technically expired in September.  As part of the agreement, the army was to withdraw from Owiny Ki-Bul, past a 30-km (18-mi) buffer zone.  The LRA was given a week to regroup at Owiny Ki-Bul, and four weeks to gather at Ri-Kwangba.  Both Kony and Otti refused to enter the camps, citing fear of arrest on the ICC warrants.  The agreement further stated that food would not be provided to LRA units outside the assembly points except in "exceptional circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;[http://irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=56146 "UGANDA: Revised gov't-LRA ceasefire deal signed"], ''IRIN'', 1 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the most significant moments for the LRA during the talks, [[United Nations]] [[Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator]] [[Jan Egeland]] met with Kony and Otti in the hopes of pushing the talks forward on 12 November 2006.  Egeland had previously stated that he would meet with Kony only if the LRA released abducted children and wounded members, but Kony denied that anyone in the LRA was either wounded or held against their will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6139554.stm "UN envoy sees Uganda rebel chief"], ''BBC News, 12 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The LRA declared that it was withdrawing from the talks on November 30, stating that UPDF had killed three of its fighters.  The deadline for the LRA fighters to finish gathering at the assembly points was 1 December.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=56580 "UGANDA: Talks hit fresh snag amid rebel protest"], ''IRIN'', 30 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Uganda denied the charge.  Also, outgoing [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] appointed [[Joaquim Chissano]], former president of [[Mozambique]], to be the UN envoy to the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=56623 "UGANDA: Museveni optimistic peace will prevail"], ''IRIN'', 5 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The truce was further extended for two more months on 18 December.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6190283.stm "Ugandan LRA rebel truce extended"], ''BBC News'', 18 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 January 2007 Ojul stated that recent comments made by al-Bashir and Kiir clearly signified that the LRA was not welcome any longer in Sudan, and that further talks should occur in [[Kenya]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6255369.stm "Rebels snub Ugandan peace talks"], BBC News, 12 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200701200030.html "Uganda: LRA Quit Juba Talks, Govt Rejects Rebels' Demands"], allAfrica.com, 21 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 March 2007 the LRA stated it would once again return to the Juba talks.&lt;ref&gt;http://allafrica.com/stories/200703140450.html&lt;/ref&gt; After [[South Africa]], [[Kenya]] and [[Mozambique]] agreed to join the peace talks (a demand the LRA had made before it would return to Juba), the next round of talks was held from 13 April to 14 April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200704021629.html allAfrica.com: Uganda: S. Africa, Kenya Join Juba Peace Talks (Page 1 of 1)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In this round, the ceasefire was extended until 30 June 2007, and [[Ri Kwangba]] was the agreed upon assembly point.  The next round of talks was set for 25 April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monitor.co.ug/sunday/news/news041510.php "Govt, LRA talks underway"]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Sunday Monitor]], 15–21 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resumption==
Following this suspension in the peace talks, the [[Juba Initiative Project]] enabled the resumption of the talks in May 2007, thanks to the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for LRA-affected areas [[Joaquim Chissano]].  The talks were again mediated by the Government of [[Southern Sudan]], but with the support of the [[United Nations]] and logistic facilitation from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), under the leadership of her local head [[Eliane Duthoit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=72489 "SUDAN-UGANDA: LRA talks, pencils and helicopters"], ''IRIN'', 31 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June 2007, the sides agreed to the principles of how justice and reconciliation will be handled, the third of the five-point agenda.  The LRA and government agreed that both formal justice procedures and the traditional [[Mato Oput]] ceremony of reconciliation would play a role.  Government delegation spokesperson Barigye Ba-Hoku stated that they would attempt to convince the ICC that this would address their concerns about impunity and that arrests under ICC auspices would not be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=73010 |title=UGANDA: LRA talks reach agreement on accountability |publisher=Irinnews.org |date=2007-06-30 |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2007, an LRA delegation led by [[Martin Ojul]] journeyed to Kampala to restate their commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict.  Ojul later led the delegation on a tour of northern Uganda to meet victims of the insurgency and ask their forgiveness.

The '''Absolute Infinite''' (''symbol'': Ω) is an extension of the idea of [[infinity]] proposed by [[mathematician]] [[Georg Cantor]].

It can be thought as a number which is bigger than any conceivable or inconceivable quantity, either finite or [[transfinite number|transfinite]].

Cantor linked the Absolute Infinite with [[God]],&lt;ref&gt;§3.2, {{cite journal

 | title=The role of the absolute infinite in Cantor's conception of set

Hugh Woodin (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PVNbIGS37wMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 11].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cantor's view ==
Cantor said:

{{quote|The actual infinite was distinguished by three relations: first, as it is realized in the supreme perfection, in the completely independent, extraworldly existence, in Deo, where I call it absolute infinite or simply absolute; second to the extent that it is represented in the dependent, creatural world; third as it can be conceived in abstracto in thought as a mathematical magnitude, number or ordertype. In the latter two relations, where it obviously reveals itself as limited and capable for further proliferation and hence familiar to the finite, I call it ''[[Transfinite number|Transfinitum]]'' and strongly contrast it with the absolute.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uni-siegen.de/fb6/phima/lehre/phima10/quellentexte/handout-phima-teil4b.pdf&lt;br/&gt;Translated quote from German: {{quote|Es wurde das Aktual-Unendliche (A-U.) nach drei Beziehungen unterschieden: erstens, sofern es in der höchsten Vollkommenheit, im völlig unabhängigen außerweltlichen Sein, in Deo realisiert ist, wo ich es Absolut Unendliches oder kurzweg Absolutes nenne; zweitens, sofern es in der abhängigen, kreatürlichen Welt vertreten ist; drittens, sofern es als mathematische Größe, Zahl oder Ordnungstypus vom Denken in abstracto aufgefaßt werden kann. In den beiden letzten Beziehungen, wo es offenbar als beschränktes, noch weiterer Vermehrung fähiges und insofern dem Endlichen verwandtes A.-U. sich darstellt, nenne ich es ''Transfinitum'' und setze es dem Absoluten strengstens entgegen.}}[Ca-a, p. 378].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cantor also mentioned the idea in his letters to [[Richard Dedekind]] (text in square brackets not present in original):{{refn|''Gesammelte Abhandlungen'',&lt;ref&gt;''Gesammelte Abhandlungen mathematischen und philosophischen Inhalts'', Georg Cantor, ed. Ernst Zermelo, with biography by Adolf Fraenkel; orig. pub. Berlin: Verlag von Julius Springer, 1932; reprinted Hildesheim: Georg Olms, 1962, and Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 1980, {{ISBN|3-540-09849-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Georg Cantor, ed.

Jean van Heijenoort, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1967, pp. 113–117.  These references both purport to be a letter from Cantor to Dedekind, dated July 28, 1899.  However, as [[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] has discovered,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digizeitschriften.de/home/services/pdfterms/?ID=516899 The Rediscovery of the Cantor-Dedekind Correspondence]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, I. Grattan-Guinness, ''Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung'' '''76''' (1974/75), pp. 104–139, at p. 126 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; this is in fact an amalgamation by Cantor's editor, [[Ernst Zermelo]], of two letters from Cantor to Dedekind, the first dated July 28 and the second dated August 3.|name=GesammelteAbhandlungen}}

{{quotation|
A [[cardinal number|multiplicity]] is called [[well-ordered]] if it fulfills the condition that every sub-multiplicity has a first [[element (mathematics)|element]]; such a multiplicity I call for short a "sequence".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now I envisage the system of all [ordinal] numbers and denote it ''Ω''.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The system ''Ω'' in its natural ordering according to magnitude is a "sequence".&lt;br /&gt;
Now let us adjoin 0 as an additional element to this sequence, and place it, obviously, in the first position; then we obtain a sequence ''Ω′'':&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
0, 1, 2, 3, ... &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1, ..., &amp;gamma;, ...
&lt;br /&gt;
of which one can readily convince oneself that every number γ occurring in it is the type [i.e., order-type] of the sequence of all its preceding elements (including 0).  (The sequence ''Ω'' has this property first for ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1. [ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1 should be ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.])&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now ''Ω&amp;prime;'' (and therefore also ''Ω'') cannot be a consistent multiplicity. For if ''Ω&amp;prime;'' were consistent, then as a well-ordered set, a number ''δ'' would correspond to it which would be greater than all numbers of the system ''Ω''; the number ''δ'', however, also belongs to the system ''Ω'', because it comprises all numbers. Thus ''δ'' would be greater than ''δ'', which is a contradiction. Therefore:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
''The system Ω of all [ordinal] numbers is an inconsistent, absolutely infinite multiplicity.''}}

== The Burali-Forti paradox ==
{{main|Burali-Forti paradox}}
The idea that the collection of all ordinal numbers cannot logically exist seems [[paradoxical]] to many. This is related to [[Burali-Forti paradox|Cesare Burali-Forti's "paradox"]] which states that there can be no greatest [[ordinal number]]. All of these problems can be traced back to the idea that, for every property that can be logically defined, there exists a set of all objects that have that property. However, as in Cantor's argument (above), this idea leads to difficulties.

More generally, as noted by [[A. W. Moore (philosopher)|A. W. Moore]], there can be no end to the process of [[set (mathematics)|set]] formation, and thus no such thing as the ''totality of all sets'', or the ''set hierarchy''.  Any such totality would itself have to be a set, thus lying somewhere within the [[cumulative hierarchy|hierarchy]] and thus failing to contain every set.

A standard solution to this problem is found in [[Zermelo set theory|Zermelo's set theory]], which does not allow the unrestricted formation of sets from arbitrary properties. Rather, we may form the set of all objects that have a given property ''and lie in some given set'' (Zermelo's [[Axiom schema of specification|Axiom of Separation]]). This allows for the formation of sets based on properties, in a limited sense, while (hopefully) preserving the consistency of the theory.

While this solves the logical problem, one could argue that the philosophical problem remains. It seems natural that a set of individuals ought to exist, so long as the individuals exist. Indeed, [[naive set theory]] might be said to be based on this notion. Although Zermelo's fix allows a [[Class (set theory)|class]] to describe arbitrary (possibly "large") entities, these predicates of the [[meta-language]] may have no formal existence (i.e., as a set) within the theory. For example, the class of all sets would be a [[proper class]]. This is philosophically unsatisfying to some and has motivated additional work in [[set theory]] and other methods of formalizing the foundations of mathematics such as [[New Foundations#How NF.28U.29 avoids the set-theoretic paradoxes|New Foundations]] by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]].

'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right to access information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right to access public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Freedom of Information (FOI) in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] is regulated by chapter 3 of the General Administrative code of Georgia, which is in force since 1999. Despite the fact that the ensuring legal framework on freedom of information contains sound provisions, in view of the existing international standards and practices, as well as existing practices in Georgia, the act is considered outdated &lt;ref name=IDFI&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= December 2015 |title= Access to Public Information in Georgia.

Anti-corruption Network for Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Istanbul Anti-corruption Action Plan |access-date= 24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, Georgian civil society organisations have advocated for improvements of the law, and the Government took obligation to elaborate a new law on freedom of information.&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt; The adoption of a new Freedom of Information law is one of the Georgian Government's commitments in the framework of its annual action plan for the implementation of the [[European Union Association Agreement|Association Agreement]] between the [[European Union|EU]] and Georgia signed in 2014.&lt;ref name=OSGF&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= July 2016|title=Reforming Georgia’s Access to Information Law |url=https://www.osgf.ge/files/2016/EU%20publication/Angarishi_A4__Corruption_ENG.pdf  |publisher=Open Society Georgia Foundation |access-date= 24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal framework==

The existing law states that all public information is open except for the cases established by the law and the information covered by privacy rights or commercial secret. In Georgia, anyone is entitled to request public information. The applicants do not have to specify the reasons for their request. An applicant has the option to be allowed to view the original of the information required or to ask for a copy. Requests for information should be made in writing, including via electronic means.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt; Fees for the provision of public information are expressly prohibited by the law, except for covering the actual costs for producing copies.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;

Public institutions are obliged to provide the requested information immediately or not later than within 10 working days of the application.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt; Applicants must be notified of the refusal to disclose information immediately and must be given, within 3 days of the refusal, a written explanation of the reason for denial and with information on the appeals procedures. In the appeal procedures, aiming at challenging the denial decision of a public institution, the burden of the proof lies with the public institutions.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;

The Georgian law also establishes that public bodies have to proactively publish information, that is without the need of sending a request, according to the rules set forth in secondary legislation, namely in the amendment made to the General Administrative Code of Georgia in 2012 on proactive disclosure and electronic request of public information.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;

Public institutions are obliged to report annually to Parliament, the President and the Prime Minister on their compliance with access to information law and provide updated statistics and data.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;

One of the most important novelties of the draft elaborated by civil society and experts is the establishment of the office of the [[Information commissioner|Information Commissioner]], a new institution with the mandate of monitoring the application of the law, revealing cases of misconduct and taking action to protect the right to public information.&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt; This would address one of the major gaps in existing legislation, i.e. the lack of a designed central body with the power to oversee the compliance of public institutions with existing regulations.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt; Another shortcoming of the current legal framework concerns the lack of a sanctions system in cases of non-compliance.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt; Also, the exceptions for non-disclosure are ambiguous and not clearly defined in the law which does not cover state-owned enterprises.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;

The shortcomings of the law have resulted in an uneven application of the right to access to information in  practice. In this process, the judiciary has not proven to be an effective means of dealing with the refusals of some public institutions to push them to disclose the required information.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;

==Access to information in practice==

Access to information law is poorly enforced in Georgia and its application remains a problem.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt; A local NGO, the [[Institute for Development of Freedom of Information|Institute for Development of Freedom of Information (IDFI)]], has conducted a comprehensive analysis assessing the implementation of the law and the compliance of public institutions to it, carrying out a series of large-scale FOI tests between 2010-2015.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;

The IDFI study shows that in the period monitored, 24% of the request filed by the organisation remained unanswered. A complete answer was received in 64% of cases and an incomplete one in 10%, while the refusal to provide the information required occurred in 2% of the cases.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt; In terms of annual evaluation, the overall response rate was the worst in 2010-11, while it improved significantly in 2012-13 - as a result of the 2012 parliamentary elections - but started to deteriorate again in 2014. Over time, the rate of provision of the requested information within the deadline established by the law improved significantly, ranging from 22% of 2010 to 75% of 2015.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt; The assessment also found out great variations between public agencies with regard to their compliance with the law: for instance, some ministers recorded a 100% response rate, others provided a complete answer in less than 50% of the cases, while the lowest score concerned the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development with a mere 10% in the rating.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt;

[[File:Mathis Gothart Grünewald 062.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Grünewald's painting "[[The Mocking of Christ (Grünewald)|The Mocking of Christ]]" depicts Christ being lashed and abused.]]
The '''aestheticization of violence''' in high culture [[art]] or [[mass media]] has been the subject of considerable controversy and debate for centuries. In Western art, graphic depictions of the [[Passion of Christ]] have long been portrayed, as have a wide range of depictions of warfare by later painters and graphic artists. Theater and, in modern times, cinema have often featured battles and violent crimes, while images and descriptions of violence have always been a part of literature. Margaret Bruder states that the aestheticization of violence in film is the depiction of violence in a "stylistically excessive", "significant and sustained way" in which audience members are able to connect references from the "play of images and [[semiotics|signs]]" to artworks, [[genre]] conventions, cultural [[symbol]]s, or concepts.&lt;ref name="bruder"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gradnet.de/papers/pomo2.archives/pomo98.papers/mtbruder98.htm |title= Aestheticizing Violence, or How To Do Things with Style |accessdate=2007-06-08 |last= Bruder |first= Margaret Ervin |year= 1998 |publisher= Film Studies, Indiana University, Bloomington IN |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040908094032/http://www.gradnet.de/papers/pomo2.archives/pomo98.papers/mtbruder98.htm |archivedate= 2004-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power of representation==

===In high culture===
[[High culture]] forms such as [[fine art]] and [[literature]] have aestheticized violence into a form of autonomous art. In 1991, [[University of Georgia]] literature professor [[Joel Black]] stated that "(if) any human act evokes the aesthetic experience of the sublime, certainly it is the act of murder". Black notes that "...if murder can be experienced aesthetically, the murderer can in turn be regarded as a kind of artist—a performance artist or anti-artist whose specialty is not creation but destruction" (1991: 14). This conception of an [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] element of murder has a long history; in the 19th century, [[Thomas de Quincey]] wrote that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Everything in this world has two handles. [[Murder]], for instance, may be laid hold of by its moral handle... and that, I confess, is its weak side; or it may also be treated aesthetically, as the Germans call it—that is, in relation to good taste."&lt;ref name="dequincey"&gt;{{cite book |last= de Quincey |first= Thomas |authorlink= Thomas de Quincey |title= On Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts |url= http://supervert.com/elibrary/thomas_de_quincey |format= Zipped PDF download |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |year= 1827 |isbn= 1-84749-133-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In popular culture===
In addition to high culture aestheticizations of violence, mass media forms such as [[newspaper]] and [[television]] news reporting have produced sensationalized reports on [[crime]] and warfare. [[Maria Tatar]]'s book ''Lustmord: Sexual Murder in [[Weimar Germany]]'' analyzes murders in pre-Hitler Germany and their artistic representations, investigating "the chilling motives behind representations that aestheticize violence, and that turn the mutilated female body into an object of fascination".&lt;ref name="pupress"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/quotes/q5641.html |title= Additional Reviews and/or Endorsements for Tatar, M.: Lustmord: Sexual Murder in Weimar Germany |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |date= 2007-04-30 |publisher= [[Princeton University Press]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060906023727/http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/quotes/q5641.html |archive-date= 2006-09-06 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baath Party Headquarters, Baghdad (3148598572).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The bombed-out remains of the Baath Party Headquarters in Baghdad.]]
Lilie Chouliaraki's article, "The aestheticization of suffering on television" (2006), analyzes "an example of war footage in order to trace the ways in which the tension between presenting airwar as an 'objective' piece of news and as an instance of intense human suffering is resolved in television's strategies of mediation". For example, Chouliaraki argues that the "bombardment of Baghdad in 2003 during the Iraq war was filmed in long-shot and presented in a quasiliterary [[narrative]] that capitalized on an aesthetics of horror, on sublime [[spectacle]] (Boltanski). She says that the "aestheticization of suffering on television is thus produced by a visual and linguistic complex that eliminates the human pain aspect of suffering, whilst retaining the phantasmagoric effects of a [[tableau vivant]]", producing an "aestheticization of suffering [that] manages simultaneously to preserve an aura of objectivity and impartiality, and to take a pro-war side in the war footage".&lt;ref name="chouliaraki"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Chouliaraki |first= Lilie |authorlink=  |coauthors=  |year= 2006 |title= The aestheticization of suffering on television |journal= Visual Communication |volume= 5 |issue= 3 |pages= 261–285 |doi= 10.1177/1470357206068455 |url= http://vcj.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/5/3/261.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070628021152/http://vcj.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/5/3/261.pdf |archivedate= 2007-06-28 |deadurl= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In films ====
A number of filmmakers from the 20th century have used aestheticized depictions of violence. According to James Fox, filmmaker [[Donald Cammell]] "...looked upon violence as an artist might look on paint. [He asked:] What are its components? What's its nature? Its glamour?"&lt;ref name="schneider"&gt;{{cite journal |quotes= |last= Schneider |first= Steven Jay |date= 2001-06-01 |title= Killing in Style: The Aestheticization of Violence in Donald Cammell's 'White of the Eye' |journal= Scope - An Online Journal of Film and Television Studies |issn= 1465-9166 |url= http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/film/journal/articles/killing-in-style.htm  |format= Archive |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040619114211/http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/film/journal/articles/killing-in-style.htm |archivedate = 2004-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Thomas Harris]] created a fictional character called [[Hannibal Lecter]], a [[cannibalism|cannibal]] and aesthete killer. In the films adapted from his work, ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991) and ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'' (2001), directors [[Jonathan Demme]] and [[Ridley Scott]], respectively intentionally generate excitement and anticipation when Lecter is about to kill (and eat) a victim. Lecter was portrayed by [[Anthony Hopkins]]. In [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986), the villain of the film, [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]], is an excessively violent man who obsesses over small [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]]es (such as blue velvet) when he is attacking and raping his victims; his obsessions help him achieve [[orgasm]].

In the film ''[[Man on Fire (2004 film)|Man on Fire]],'' which tells the story of a burnt-out former [[Black Ops]] agent who seeks to avenge the kidnappers of a young girl he was bodyguarding, a character says that the agent is an "artist" in killing. He says the man is about to "paint his masterpiece" as he seeks out and kills all of the members of the criminal organization who were connected with the child abduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Roger |last= Ebert |title= Man on Fire Movie Review |url= http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/man-on-fire-2004 |date= 2004-04-23 |accessdate=2016-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Xavier Morales' review of [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Kill Bill:&lt;!-- The official website shows a colon in the title. See here: http://www.miramax.com/movie/kill-bill-volume-1/ --&gt; Volume 1]]'', entitled "Beauty and violence", he calls the film "a groundbreaking aestheticization of violence".  Morales says that the film, which he calls "easily one of the most violent movies ever made", "a breathtaking landscape in which art and violence coalesce into one unforgettable aesthetic experience".&lt;ref name="morales"/&gt;

Morales argues that "...&amp;nbsp;Tarantino manages to do precisely what Alex de Large was trying to do in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]:'' he presents violence as a form of expressive art...[in which the]...violence is so physically graceful, visually dazzling and meticulously executed that our instinctual, emotional responses undermine any rational objections we may have. Tarantino is able to transform an object of moral outrage into one of aesthetic beauty...[, in which,]...like all art forms, the violence serves a communicative purpose apart from its aesthetic value". When the female sword-wielding protagonist "...skillfully slices and dices her way through...[the opposing fighters]...we get a sense that she is using them as a kind of canvas for her expression of revenge...[,]...like an artist who expresses herself through brush and paint,...[she]...expresses herself through sword and blood".&lt;ref name="morales"&gt;{{cite news|first=Xavier |last=Morales |title=Beauty and violence |url=http://media.www.hlrecord.org/media/storage/paper609/news/2003/10/16/Etc/Kill-Bill.Beauty.And.Violence-530854.shtml |work=The Record |publisher=Harvard Law School RECORD Corporation |date=2003-10-16 |accessdate=2007-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021234/http://media.www.hlrecord.org/media/storage/paper609/news/2003/10/16/Etc/Kill-Bill.Beauty.And.Violence-530854.shtml |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critics analyzing violent film images that seek to aesthetically please the viewer mainly fall into two categories. Critics who see depictions of violence in film as superficial and exploitative argue that it leads audience members to become desensitized to brutality, thus increasing their aggression. On the other hand, critics who view violence as a type of content, or as a theme, claim it is cathartic and provides "acceptable outlets for anti-social impulses".&lt;ref name="bruder"/&gt;

Adrian Martin argues that critics who hold violent cinema in high regard have developed a response to anti-violence advocates, "those who decry everything from ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' to ''[[Terminator 2]]'' as dehumanising, desensitising cultural influences". Martin claims that critics who value aestheticized violence defend shocking depictions onscreen on the grounds that "screen violence is not real violence, and should never be confused with it". He claims that their rebuttal also claims that "movie violence is fun, spectacle, make-believe; it's dramatic metaphor, or a necessary catharsis akin to that provided by [[Jacobean theatre]]; it's generic, pure sensation, pure fantasy. It has its own changing history, its codes, its precise aesthetic uses."&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Adrian |year=2000 |title=The Offended Critic: Film Reviewing and Social Commentary |journal=Senses of Cinema |volume= |issue=8 |pages= |issn=1443-4059 |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/8/offended.html |format=Archive |accessdate=2007-06-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519074902/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/8/offended.html |archivedate=2007-05-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Bruder]], a film studies professor at Indiana University and the author of ''Aestheticizing Violence, or How To Do Things with Style,'' proposes that there is a distinction between aestheticized violence and the use of gore and blood in mass market action or war films. She argues that "aestheticized violence is not merely the excessive use of violence in a film". Movies such as the popular action film ''[[Die Hard 2]]'' are very violent, but they do "not fall into the category of aestheticized violence because it is not stylistically excessive in a significant and sustained way".&lt;ref name="bruder" /&gt;

But Bruder classifies films as using "stylized [e.g. aestheticized] violence if they "revel in guns, gore and explosions, exploiting [[mise-en-scene]] not so much to provide narrative environment as to create the appearance of a 'movie' atmosphere against which specifically cinematic spectacle can unfold". In movies with aestheticized violence, she argues that the "standard realist modes of editing and cinematography are violated in order to spectacularize the action being played out on the screen"; directors use "quick and awkward editing", "canted framings", shock cuts, and slow motion, to emphasize the impacts of bullets or the "spurting of blood".&lt;ref name="bruder" /&gt;

For viewers of films with aestheticized violence, such as [[John Woo]]'s movies, she claims that "One of the many pleasures" from watching Woo's films, such as ''[[Hard Target]]'' is that it gets viewers to recognize how Woo plays with conventions "from other Woo films" and how it "connects up with films...which include imitations of or homages to Woo". Bruder argues that films with aestheticized violence such as "''Hard Target'', ''[[True Romance]]'' and ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'' are [filled] with... signs" and indicators, so that "the stylized violence they contain ultimately serves as...another interruption in the narrative drive" of the film.&lt;ref name="bruder" /&gt;

Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Dwight Garner reviews the controversy and [[moral panic]] surrounding the 1991 novel and 2000 film ''[[American Psycho]]'', which concerns [[Patrick Bateman]], "an Exeter and Harvard grad, a gourmand, a tanning enthusiast and a ruthless fashion critic" who is also a [[serial killer]]. Garner concludes that the film was a "coal-black satire" in which "dire comedy mixes with [[Grand Guignol]]. There's demented opera in some of its scenes." The book, meanwhile, has acquired "grudging respect" and is "seen as a transgressive bag of broken glass that can be talked about alongside plasma-soaked trips like Anthony Burgess's ''A Clockwork Orange''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Dwight |last= Garner |title= In Hindsight, an ‘American Psycho’ Looks a Lot Like Us |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/theater/in-hindsight-an-american-psycho-looks-a-lot-like-us.html |newspaper= The New York Times |date=2016-03-24 |accessdate=2016-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garner claims that the novel's author, [[Bret Easton Ellis]], "was racing ahead of the culture" and that his book "was ahead of its time": "The culture has shifted to make room for Bateman. We've developed a taste for barbaric libertines with twinkling eyes and some zing in their tortured souls. [[Tony Soprano]], [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] from "''[[Breaking Bad]]''", [[Hannibal Lecter]] (who predates "''American Psycho''")—here are the most significant pop culture characters of the past 30 years... Thanks to these characters, and to [[first-person shooter]] [[video games]], we’ve learned to identify with the bearer of violence and not just cower before him or her."

==History in art==

===Antiquity===
[[Plato]] proposed to ban poets from his [[The Republic (Plato)|ideal republic]] because he feared that their aesthetic ability to construct attractive [[narrative]]s about immoral behaviour would corrupt young minds. Plato's writings refer to poetry as a kind of [[rhetoric]], whose "...influence is pervasive and often harmful". Plato believed that poetry that was "unregulated by philosophy is a danger to soul and community". He warned that tragic poetry can produce "a disordered psychic regime or constitution" by inducing "a dream-like, uncritical state in which we lose ourselves in ...sorrow, grief, anger, [and] resentment". As such, Plato was in effect arguing that "What goes on in the theater, in your home, in your fantasy life, are connected" to what one does in real life.&lt;ref name="griswold"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Griswold |first= Charles |editor= Edward N. Zalta |encyclopedia= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title= Plato on Rhetoric and Poetry |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2004/entries/plato-rhetoric/ |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |edition= Spring 2004 |date= 2003-12-22 |publisher= The Metaphysics Research Lab, Center for the Study of Language and Information, [[Stanford University]] |location= Stanford, CA |issn= 1095-5054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]], though, advocated a useful role for music, drama, and tragedy: a way for people to purge their negative emotions. Aristotle mentions [[catharsis]] at the end of his ''Politics'', where he notes that after people listen to music that elicits pity and fear, they "are liable to become possessed" by these negative emotions. However, afterwards, Aristotle points out that these people return to "a normal condition as if they had been medically treated and undergone a purge [catharsis]&amp;nbsp;... All experience a certain purge [catharsis] and pleasant relief. In the same manner cathartic melodies give innocent joy to men" (from ''Politics'' VIII:7; 1341b 35-1342a 8).&lt;ref name="dhi"&gt;{{cite book |editor= Philip P.

===15th century – 17th century===

The artist [[Hieronymus Bosch]], from the 15th and 16th centuries, used images of demons, half-human animals and machines to evoke fear and confusion to portray the evil of man. The 16th-century artist [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] depicted "...the nightmarish imagery that reflect, if in an extreme fashion, popular dread of the [[Apocalypse]] and Hell".&lt;ref name="alsford"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.trytel.com/~tristan/towns/florilegium/lcdth_i.html |title= Death - Introductory essay |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |last= Alsford |first= Stephen |date= 2004-02-29 |work= Florilegium Urbanum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mathis Gothart-Neithart]], a German artist known as "Grünewald" (1480–1528) depicted "intense emotion, especially painful emotion". His painting of the Crucifixion "...does not spare the beholder. Grünewald relentlessly brings out all the marks of terrible suffering and agony, induced by the cruelty and torture of the executioners...[vividly conveying] a sense of horror and pain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gilbert |first= William |title= Renaissance and Reformation |url= http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/ |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |year= 1998 |publisher= Carrie |location= Lawrence, KS |chapter= Chapter 22: Renaissance Art in Northern Europe |chapterurl= http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/22.html | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070607032139/http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/| archivedate= 7 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Grünewald's 'Isenheim Altarpiece' also shows a violent image of Jesus on the cross, "with his body covered in wounds", with the focus on "...&amp;nbsp;Jesus' suffering and his death".&lt;ref name="smc"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~jeharris/smc200_minutes |title= Lecture minutes for SMC 200Y: The Christian Imagination |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |last= Yang |first= H |year= 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071125185444/http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~jeharris/smc200_minutes |archive-date=2007-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century – present===
In the mid-18th century, [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]], an Italian etcher, archaeologist and architect active from 1740, did imaginary etchings of prisons that depicted people "stretched on racks or trapped like rats in maze-like dungeons", an "aestheticization of violence and suffering".&lt;ref&gt;

In 1849, as revolutions raged in European streets and authorities were putting down protests and consolidating state powers, composer [[Richard Wagner]] wrote: "I have an enormous desire to practice a little artistic terrorism."&lt;ref name="dworkin"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/Editor/DworkinTrotsky.pdf |title= Trotsky's Hammer |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |last= Dworkin |first= Craig |date= 2006-01-17 |format= PDF |publisher= Department of English, University of Utah |location= Salt Lake City, UT |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070626072920/http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/Editor/DworkinTrotsky.pdf |archivedate= 2007-06-26 |deadurl= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laurent Tailhade]] is reputed to have stated, after [[Auguste Vaillant]] bombed the Chamber of Deputies in 1893: "{{lang|fr|Qu'importent les victimes, si le geste est beau?}} [What do the victims matter, so long as the gesture is beautiful]." In 1929 [[André Breton]]'s Second Manifesto on [[surrealist art]] stated that "{{lang|fr|L’acte surréaliste le plus simple consiste, revolvers aux poings, à descendre dans la rue et à tirer au hasard, tant qu’on peut, dans la foule}}" [The simplest Surrealist act consists of running down into the street, pistols in hand, and firing blindly, as fast as you can pull the trigger, into the crowd]."&lt;ref name="dworkin" /&gt;

==Theories and semiotic analysis==
{{Semiotics}}

===Baudrillard===
French [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] theorist [[Jean Baudrillard]] argues that whereas modern societies were "...organized around the production and consumption of [[commodification|commodities]]", "postmodern societies are organized around simulation and the play of images and [[semiotics|signs]]". As such, in "...the postmodern media and consumer society, everything becomes an image, a sign, a spectacle". For Baudrillard, the West's "commercialization of the whole world...will turn out rather to have been the aestheticization of the whole world—its cosmopolitan spectacularization, its transformation into images, its semiological organization". As a result, the "previously separate domains of the [[economy]], art, politics, and sexuality" become "collapsed into each other", and art penetrates "all spheres of existence." Thus, Baudrillard argues that "[o]ur society has given rise to a general aestheticization: all forms of culture—not excluding anti-cultural ones—are promoted and all models of representation and anti-representation are taken on board".&lt;ref name="kellner"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Kellner |first= Douglas |editor= Edward N. Zalta |encyclopedia= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title= Jean Baudrillard |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2005/entries/baudrillard/ |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |edition= Summer 2005 |date= 2005-08-22 |publisher= The Metaphysics Research Lab, Center for the Study of Language and Information, [[Stanford University]] |location= Stanford, CA |issn= 1095-5054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semiotic analysis===

====Still images====
When a person views an isolated painting, photograph or cartoon, they are viewing a static image. If a photographer takes a still photo of a police officer's struggle to arrest a young man, for example, the [[denotation (Semiotics)|denotative]] meaning might be "there was a man dressed as a police officer placing his hand on the shoulder of another man of a certain age whilst a photographer took a picture". On the other hand, the [[connotation (semiotics)|connotative]] meanings might range from, "law enforcement in action" to "a heroic fight to subdue a dangerous terrorist about to release [[sarin gas]]", to "police use excessive force to arrest non-violent protesters", to "fancy dress party ends badly".  The attribution of the specific [[subtext]] is left to the caption writer, the text accompanying the photo, and the audience.

Critic [[Susan Sontag]] argued that, through repeated exposure, certain well-known photographs have become "ethical reference points", such as the many images depicting the victims and liberation of the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] (1977).  From this perspective, the subtext of such images, though still connotatively open to interpretation, has been somewhat restrained by familiarity, predominant cultural beliefs regarding the [[Holocaust]], and perhaps by overusage.

=====News reporting=====
If there is a motion picture or video recording of the previously described scenario of a police officer arresting a man, the filmmakers, videographers, and editors may reframe this scene, by fragmenting the recording, depicting it from different vantage points, editing the material, and reassembling these components. A film editor can produce a non-[[realism (arts)|realistic]] sequence of intercut, edited images, which forces the audience to interpret those images according to a different set of [[semiotic]] rules. Even without editing or alteration, a film or video recordings' ''[[mise en scène]]'' and non-verbal signs become much more explicit and enable the audience to attribute meaning to the scenario.
 
The [[value (Semiotics)|value]] of this video as a [[Sign (semiotics)|signifier]] will be determined by its relation to the other signifiers in the system. Thus, if the video is included in a reputable television news program, it will acquire a greater claim to be indexical and its status is more likely to be considered reliable "evidence" of real world events. In semiotic terms, the words spoken by the television presenter will be symbolic, and the images will have both iconic and indexical qualities.

The "semiotic value" of the video will change if it is transposed into a polemical or satirical programme, presented by a commentator, or screened with on-screen captions (e.g., "Crime Wave in the Streets", or "Protesters Brutalized by Police"). These substitute contexts form [[modality (semiotics)|modality]] indicators that may help the viewer to assess the plausibility, credibility, or truthfulness of the content. The violence shown on-screen can be '''aestheticized''' by the values of the symbolical signs used by the news presenter, by captions placed on-screen, or by the relations with other signifiers in the same programme (e.g., if the arrest video is preceded by a report about "antisocial and criminal behaviour").

=====Fictional film or video=====
If a film or television director staged a similar fictional scene, the audience will be predisposed to consider it less "real". They know that the scenario is being filtered through the film maker's sensibilities and the outcome will reflect the director's motives. Hence, the lighting, makeup, costumes, acting methods, cutting, and [[soundtrack]] music selection are understood to be combined to inform the audience about the film maker's intentions.

The [[culture industry]]'s mass-produced texts and images about crime, violence, and war have been consolidated into [[genres]]. Film makers typically choose from a predictable range of narrative [[Convention (norm)|convention]]s and use [[stereotype]]d  characters, and [[cliché]]d symbols and metaphors. Over time, certain styles and conventions of filming and editing are standardised within a medium or a genre. Some conventions tend to naturalise the content and  make it seem more real. Other methods deliberately breach convention to create an effect, such as the canted angles, rapid edits, and slow motion shots used in films with aestheticized violence.

=====Analysis of selected films=====
{{refimprove|date=February 2016}}
* ''[[The Accused (1988 film)|The Accused]]'': In this 1988 film, filmmaker [[Jonathan Kaplan]] stages a graphic rape scene to consider the moral and legal quality of the fictional spectators who, while not engaging in the rape, nevertheless shouted encouragement to those that were.
* ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]'': Matthew Crowder analyzes the aestheticization of violence in ''Strange Days'', a film by director [[Kathryn Bigelow]] (1995). A scene graphically depicts the rape of a woman; it is "...filmed in real-time using a first-person subjective camera". ''Strange Days'' tells the story of Lenny Nero, who sells an illegal, futuristic technology that allows people to record their sensory experiences onto a minidisc, so that other people can "play back" these sensory experiences and have them "wired" directly into their brain.
**In the film, Max records his rape of Iris, and gives the recording to the unsuspecting Lenny. When the "perpetrator of violence [Max] is given control of the cinematic apparatus", this is "referencing films such as ''Peeping Tom'' (Michael Powell, 1959) and ''Halloween'' (Carpenter, 1978)". Like "''Peeping Tom's'' psychopathic killer, Max does seem to see himself as some kind of artist, recording the rape and sending it to Lenny". 
**The "...first person perspective the filming of the rape scene is unrelenting, the camera never turns away from the fear and panic of Iris whose body is not only slung about by the unknown killer but also subjected to an unflinching gaze that the audience is punished with too, made complicit in the rape by their passivity". Crowder argues that "[t]he entire notion of the subjective camera—an aesthetic element of the film—its scopophilic, voyeuristic and sadistic nature, is revealed in all its depravity". As such, "[t]he aesthetic experience of the [rape] scene is one of shock, horror, dislocation and passivity at the way the camera represents the helpless body of Iris as no more than an object".
**The film's use of "playback" clips, as in the rape scene, causes a "...stylistic disruption of Hollywood codes and an even more important aesthetic effect: the disruption of the normal codes of identification with character and narrative".&lt;ref name="crowder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savingtheworld.co.uk/showPage.php?page=22 |title=Aesthetics and Politics: Strange Days |accessdate=2007-06-08 |last=Crowder |first=Matthew |year=2006 |work=Saving The World |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822044114/http://www.savingtheworld.co.uk/showPage.php?page=22 |archivedate=2007-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Bigelow was criticized for the rape scene by [[Carla Peterson (academic)|Carla Peterson]], in her article "Director joins boys' club -- and it only costs her compassion" (1995).  Crowder claims that Peterson attacked ''Strange Days'' "... as misogynist and offensive because she [Peterson] feels that it tries to create an unproblematic, if slightly uncomfortable, spectacle out of rape". As such, Crowder argues that Peterson "... fails to see that the film concerns more than a logical narrative (which if anything grows increasingly incoherent)" and claims that Peterson has "...misread the scene out of context" and dismissed "...textual elements that clearly signal criticism of both Hollywood and the cinematic apparatus as a tool of masculinist domination".
**Crowder "challenge[s] whether Peterson's response is actually aesthetic, as she makes little reference to communication between work and audience". In contrast, Crowder interprets ''Strange Days'' in a feminist context, which he argues is "...perhaps its most persuasive aesthetic effect". Crowder holds that "...''Strange Days'' can be seen as a self-conscious discourse on cinema and that part of this discourse concerns the act of aesthetic judgement". Furthermore, he states that the film's "narrative can be seen to allegorise the problem of aesthetics and value".&lt;ref name="crowder" /&gt;
* ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'': ''A Clockwork Orange'' is a 1971 film written, directed, and produced by [[Stanley Kubrick]] and based on the novel of the same name by [[Anthony Burgess]]. Set in a futuristic England (circa 1995, as imagined in 1965), it follows the life of a teenage gang leader named Alex. In Alexander Cohen's analysis of Kubrick's film, he argues that the "ultra-violence" of the young protagonist, Alex, "...represents the breakdown of culture itself". In the film, gang members are "...[s]eeking idle de-contextualized violence as entertainment" as an escape from the emptiness of their [[dystopia]]n society.
**Cohen claims that in the film, "...the violence of modern technology sees its reflection in Ultraviolence, beyond violence". When the protagonist murders a woman in her home, Cohen states that Kubrick presents a "[s]cene of aestheticized death" by setting the murder in a room filled with "...modern art which depict scenes of sexual intensity and bondage"; as such, the scene depicts a "...struggle between high-culture which has aestheticized violence and sex into a form of autonomous art, and the very image of post-modern mastery".&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cinemaspace.berkeley.edu/Cinema_Beyond/C_B.lectures/ClockworkOrange/Benj_CultIndustr_Clckwrk.html |title=Clockwork Orange and the Aestheticization of Violence |accessdate=2007-06-08 |last=Cohen |first=Alexander J. |year=1998 |publisher=UC Berkeley Program in Film Studies |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515160450/http://cinemaspace.berkeley.edu/Cinema_Beyond/C_B.lectures/ClockworkOrange/Benj_CultIndustr_Clckwrk.html |archivedate=2007-05-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Apple''''' is a 1966 conceptual artwork by the Japanese artist [[Yoko Ono]].

==Work==
The work consists of an [[apple]] on top of a [[plexiglass]] stand. A brass plaque bearing the word 'APPLE' is fixed to the front of the stand.&lt;ref name=VF15&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/05/yoko-ono-moma-exhibit-review|title=The Two Must-See, Must-Do, Must Step-On Works at Yoko Ono's MoMA Show|date=May 2015|author=Bruce Handy|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was subsequently covered in [[bronze]] as part of Ono's 'Bronze Age' series of artworks.&lt;ref name="BeramBoriss-Krimsky2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nell Beram|author2=Carolyn Boriss-Krimsky|title=Yoko Ono: Collector of Skies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pCOWKp3LZ0C|date=1 February 2012|publisher=Abrams|isbn=978-1-61312-513-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The work was shown at Ono's autumn 1966 show, ''Unfinished Paintings and Objects By Yoko Ono'' at the [[Indica Gallery]] in London.&lt;ref name="BeramBoriss-Krimsky2012"/&gt; The preview night of Ono's Indica exhibition on 9 November 1966 was visited by the musician [[John Lennon]] who had heard that "this amazing woman was going to be putting on a show...and it was going to be a bit of a happening". Lennon described himself as "astounded" at the "apple on sale for two hundred quid; I thought it was fantastic—I got her work immediately...it was two hundred quid to watch the fresh apple decompose". The piece also appealed to Lennon as he "didn't have to have much knowledge about avant-garde or underground art... the humor got me straight away".&lt;ref name="BeramBoriss-Krimsky2012"/&gt; Lennon took a bite out of the apple on display, before apologising and putting the apple back. Ono later recalled that "...he just grabbed it and bit it and looked at me like, you know, "There!" you know? I was so furious, I didn't know what to say. And it all showed in my face: How dare this person, you know, mess around with my work?".&lt;ref name='MOMA'&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple. Yoko Ono. 1966.|url=https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/15/368|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon was subsequently impressed by his interaction with Ono's piece ''[[Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting]]''.&lt;ref name="BeramBoriss-Krimsky2012"/&gt;

''Apple'' was recreated for the first time in four decades in 2006 at a recreation of the Indica Gallery at the art gallery [[Riflemaker]] in London's Soho district. The original Indica had closed in 1967.&lt;ref name=Ind06&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/john-and-yoko-love-at-first-bite-423973.html|title=John and Yoko: Love at first bite|date=12 November 2006|author=Anthony Barnes|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was displayed at Ono's 2015 retrospective, ''Yoko Ono: One Woman Show, 1960–1971'' at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City. Critic Bruce Handy highlighted ''Apple'' as one of the "must see" pieces from the exhibition, and believed the [[apple]] itself to be of the [[Granny Smith]] [[cultivar]].&lt;ref name=VF15/&gt;

==Interpretation==
In 1966 Ono described the "...excitement of watching the apple decay, and the decision as to whether to replace it, or just thinking of the beauty of the apple after it's gone".&lt;ref name=VF15/&gt; Bruce Handy wrote that the accompanying label for ''Apple'' highlighted for the viewer the juxtaposition between the physical permanence of the pedestal's brass plaque and the "passage of time marked by the apple's decay and periodic renewal as it is replaced throughout the course of the exhibition" a relationship that begins as "the transparent base recedes into space".&lt;ref name=VF15/&gt;

The avant-garde pushes the boundaries of what is accepted as the [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] or the [[status quo]], primarily in the cultural realm. The avant-garde is considered by some to be a hallmark of [[modernism]], as distinct from [[postmodernism]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}. Many [[artists]] have aligned themselves with the avant-garde movement and still continue to do so, tracing a history from [[Dada]] through [[Situationist International|the Situationists]] to postmodern artists such as the [[Language poets]] around 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ubu.com/ UBU Web] List of artists from Dada to the present day aligning themselves with the avant-garde&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2016}}

The avant-garde also promotes radical social reforms. It was this meaning that was evoked by the [[Saint Simonian]] [[Olinde Rodrigues]] in his essay "L'artiste, le savant et l'industriel" ("The artist, the scientist and the industrialist", 1825), which contains the first recorded use of "avant-garde" in its now customary sense: there, Rodrigues calls on artists to "serve as [the people's] avant-garde", insisting that "the power of the arts is indeed the most immediate and fastest way" to social, political and economic reform.&lt;ref&gt;Matei Calinescu, ''[https://www.dukeupress.edu/five-faces-of-modernity/ The Five Faces of Modernity: Modernism, Avant-Garde, Decadence, Kitsch, Postmodernism]'' (Durham: [[Duke University Press]], 1987), {{Page needed|date=May 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several writers have attempted to map the parameters of avant-garde activity. The Italian essayist [[Renato Poggioli]] provides one of the earliest analyses of vanguardism as a cultural phenomenon in his 1962 book ''Teoria dell'arte d'avanguardia'' (''The Theory of the Avant-Garde'').&lt;ref&gt;Sascha Bru and Gunther Martens, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=suPzDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21 The Invention of Politics in the European Avant-Garde (1906–1940)]'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2006), p. 21. {{ISBN|9042019093}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Surveying the historical, social, psychological and philosophical aspects of [[vanguardism]], Poggioli reaches beyond individual instances of art, poetry, and music to show that vanguardists may share certain ideals or values which manifest themselves in the non-conformist lifestyles they adopt: He sees  vanguard culture as a variety or subcategory of [[Bohemianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Renato Poggioli|title=The Theory of the Avant-Garde |publisher=Belknap Press of [[Harvard University Press]]| year = 1968 | isbn = 0-674-88216-4 |page=11}}, translated from the Italian by Gerald Fitzgerald&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have attempted both to clarify and to extend Poggioli's study. The [[Germans|German]] literary critic Peter Bürger's ''Theory of the Avant-Garde'' (1974) looks at [[the Establishment]]'s embrace of socially critical works of art and suggests that in complicity with capitalism, "art as an institution neutralizes the political content of the individual work".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Peter Bürger|title=Theorie der Avantgarde|publisher=Suhrkamp Verlag|year=1974}} English translation (University of Minnesota Press) 1984: 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bürger's essay also greatly influenced the work of contemporary American art-historians such as the German [[Benjamin H. D. Buchloh]] (born 1941). Buchloh, in the collection of essays ''Neo-avantgarde and Culture Industry'' (2000) critically argues for a dialectical approach to these positions.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Buchloh, ''Neo-avantgarde and Culture Industry: Essays on European and American Art from 1955 to 1975'' (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2001) {{ISBN|0-262-02454-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent criticism theorized the limitations of these approaches, noting their circumscribed areas of analysis, including Eurocentric, chauvinist, and genre-specific definitions.&lt;ref&gt;

==Relation to mainstream society==
{{See|Mainstream}}
{{see also|Media culture|Spectacle (critical theory)}}
The concept of avant-garde refers primarily to artists, writers, composers and thinkers whose work is opposed to mainstream cultural values and often has a trenchant social or political edge. Many writers, critics and theorists made assertions about vanguard culture during the formative years of modernism, although the initial definitive statement on the avant-garde was the essay ''[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]'' by New York art critic [[Clement Greenberg]], published in ''[[Partisan Review]]'' in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Greenberg |first= Clement|date=Fall 1939 |title=Avant-Garde and Kitsch |url=http://hgar-srv3.bu.edu/collections/partisan-review/search/detail?id=283920 |magazine=The Partisan Review |pages=34-49 |volume=6 |issue=5 |access-date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg argued that vanguard culture has historically been opposed to "high" or "mainstream" culture, and that it has also rejected the artificially synthesized [[mass culture]] that has been produced by industrialization. Each of these media is a direct product of [[Capitalism]]—they are all now substantial industries—and as such they are driven by the same profit-fixated motives of other sectors of manufacturing, not the ideals of true art. For Greenberg, these forms were therefore ''[[kitsch]]'': phony, faked or mechanical culture, which often pretended to be more than they were by using formal devices stolen from vanguard culture. For instance, during the 1930s the advertising industry was quick to take visual mannerisms from [[surrealism]], but this does not mean that 1930s advertising photographs are truly surreal.

[[File:AdornoHorkheimerHabermasbyJeremyJShapiro2.png|thumb|right|[[Max Horkheimer]] (front left), [[Theodor Adorno]] (front right), and [[Jürgen Habermas]] in the background, right, in 1965 at [[Heidelberg]], [[West Germany]].]]

Various members of the [[Frankfurt School]] argued similar views: thus [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer]] in their essay ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment|The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass-Deception]]'' (1944), and also [[Walter Benjamin]] in his highly influential "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" (1935, rev. 1939).&lt;ref&gt;Walter Benjamin, "[http://bid.berkeley.edu/bidclass/readings/benjamin.html The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]" {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205013822/http://bid.berkeley.edu/bidclass/readings/benjamin.html |date=5 December 2006 }}{{Full citation needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;!--Place, publisher, translator, etc. needed.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Where Greenberg used the German word ''[[kitsch]]'' to describe the antithesis of avant-garde culture, members of the Frankfurt School coined the term "[[mass culture]]" to indicate that this bogus culture is constantly being manufactured by a newly emerged [[culture industry]] (comprising commercial publishing houses, the movie industry, the record industry, and the electronic media).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.sociosite.net/topics/texts/adorno_culture_reconsidered.pdf Theodor W. Adorno (1963)], "[[Culture Industry Reconsidered]]: Selected Essays on Mass Culture", London: Routledge, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; They also pointed out that the rise of this industry meant that artistic excellence was displaced by sales figures as a measure of worth: a novel, for example, was judged meritorious solely on whether it became a best-seller, music succumbed to ratings charts and to the blunt commercial logic of the Gold disc. In this way the autonomous artistic merit so dear to the vanguardist was abandoned and sales increasingly became the measure, and justification, of everything. Consumer culture now ruled.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The avant-garde's [[Recuperation (politics)|co-option]] by the global capitalist market, by [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economies, and by what [[Guy Debord]] called ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'', have made contemporary critics speculate on the possibility of a meaningful avant-garde today. Paul Mann's ''Theory-Death of the Avant-Garde'' demonstrates how completely the avant-garde is embedded within institutional structures today, a thought also pursued by [[Richard Schechner]] in his analyses of avant-garde performance.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Schechner, "The Conservative Avant-Garde." ''New Literary History'' 41.4 (Autumn 2010): 895–913.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the central arguments of Greenberg, Adorno and others, various sectors of the mainstream culture industry have co-opted and misapplied the term "avant-garde" since the 1960s, chiefly as a marketing tool to publicise popular music and commercial cinema. It has become common to describe successful rock musicians and celebrated film-makers as "avant-garde", the very word having been stripped of its proper meaning. Noting this important conceptual shift, major contemporary theorists such as [[Matei Calinescu]] in ''Five Faces of Modernity: Modernism, Avant-garde, Decadence, Kitsch, Postmodernism'' (1987),{{page needed|date=September 2012}} and Hans Bertens in ''The Idea of the Postmodern: A History'' (1995),{{page needed|date=September 2012}} have suggested that this is a sign our culture has entered a new [[post-modern]] age, when the former [[modernist]] ways of thinking and behaving have been rendered redundant.&lt;ref&gt;Calinescu 1987,{{page needed|date=September 2012}}; Bertens 1995.{{page needed|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, an incisive critique of vanguardism as against the views of mainstream society was offered by the New York critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Rosenberg, ''The De-Definition of Art: Action Art to Pop to Earthworks'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1983), p. 219 {{ISBN|0-226-72673-8}}. Originally published: New York: Horizon Press, 1972; reprinted New York: Collier Books, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Trying to strike a balance between the insights of Renato Poggioli and the claims of Clement Greenberg, Rosenberg suggested that from the mid-1960s onward progressive culture ceased to fulfill its former adversarial role. Since then it has been flanked by what he called "avant-garde ghosts to the one side, and a changing mass culture on the other", both of which it interacts with to varying degrees. This has seen culture become, in his words, "a profession one of whose aspects is the pretense of overthrowing it".&lt;ref&gt;George Dickie, "[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Arts/Arts-idx?type=turn&amp;id=Arts.ArtsSocv12i2&amp;entity=Arts.ArtsSocv12i2.p0074&amp;isize=text "Symposium on Marxist Aesthetic Thought: Commentary on the Papers by Rudich, San Juan, and Morawski]", ''Arts in Society: Art and Social Experience: Our Changing Outlook on Culture'' 12, no. 2 (Summer–Fall 1975): p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===Music===
{{Main article|Avant-garde music}}
Avant-garde in music can refer to any form of music working within traditional structures while seeking to breach boundaries in some manner.&lt;ref name=iha&gt;David Nicholls (ed.), ''The Cambridge History of American Music'' (Cambridge and New York: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1998), 122–24. {{ISBN|0-521-45429-8}} {{ISBN|978-0-521-54554-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used loosely to describe the work of any musicians who radically depart from tradition altogether.&lt;ref name="Samson"&gt;Jim Samson, "Avant garde", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; By this definition, some avant-garde composers of the 20th century include [[Arnold Schoenberg]],&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xiv"&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), xiv. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Ives]],&lt;ref&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), 222. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Igor Stravinsky]],&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xiv" /&gt; [[Anton Webern]],&lt;ref name="Sitsky_50"&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), 50. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Antheil]] (in his earliest works only), [[Alban Berg]],&lt;ref name="Sitsky_50" /&gt; [[Henry Cowell]] (in his earliest works), [[Philip Glass]], [[Harry Partch]], [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], [[Richard Strauss]] (in his earliest work),&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xiii"&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), xiii–xiv. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]],&lt;ref&gt;Elliot Schwartz, Barney Childs, and James Fox (eds.), ''Contemporary Composers on Contemporary Music'' (New York: Da Capo Press, 1998), 379. {{ISBN|0-306-80819-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edgard Varèse]], and [[Iannis Xenakis]].&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xiv" /&gt; Although most avant-garde composers have been men, this is not exclusively the case. Women avant-gardists include [[Pauline Oliveros]], [[Diamanda Galás]], [[Meredith Monk]], and [[Laurie Anderson]].&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xvii"&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), xvii. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is another definition of "Avant-gardism" that distinguishes it from "modernism": Peter Bürger, for example, says avant-gardism rejects the "institution of art" and challenges social and artistic values, and so necessarily involves political, social, and cultural factors.&lt;ref name="Samson" /&gt; According to the composer and musicologist [[Larry Sitsky]], modernist composers from the early 20th century who do not qualify as avant-gardists include Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, and Igor Stravinsky; later modernist composers who do not fall into the category of avant-gardists include [[Elliott Carter]], [[Milton Babbitt]], [[György Ligeti]], [[Witold Lutosławski]], and [[Luciano Berio]], since "their modernism was not conceived for the purpose of goading an audience."&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xv"&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), xv. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre===
{{Main article|Experimental theatre}}

Whereas the avant-garde has a significant history in 20th-century music, it is more pronounced in theatre and performance art, and often in conjunction with music and sound design innovations, as well as developments in visual media design. There are movements in theatre history that are characterized by their contributions to the avant-garde traditions in both the United States and Europe. Among these are [[Fluxus]], [[Happenings]], and [[Neo-Dada]].

A '''bēot''' is [[Old English]] for a ritualized boast, vow, threat, or promise.&lt;ref name="Einarsson 1934"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einarsson|first1=Stefán|title=Old English ''Beot'' and Old Icelandic ''Heitstrenging''|journal=PMLA|date=1934|volume=49|issue=4|pages=980|JSTOR=458120|doi=10.2307/458120|quote=For these and other instances of different meaning, see the dictionaries. They give three chief meanings: (1) a threatening, menace; (2) danger; and (3) boasting promise. It seems that the third one is the most usual, and logically the meanings would seem to have developed in the order: promise—boasting—threatening—danger.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hall 1960 p42"&gt;[[Clark Hall, John R.]] ''A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary''. Cambridge University Press, 1960, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of a ''bēot'' is to proclaim one's acceptance of a seemingly impossible challenge in order to gain tremendous glory for actually accomplishing it.

Anglo-Saxon warriors would usually deliver ''bēot''s in the [[mead hall]] the night before a military engagement&lt;ref&gt;Einarsson, 1934, p. 976-978&lt;/ref&gt; or during the battle itself.&lt;ref&gt;Einarsson, 1934, p. 978-979&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a typical warrior may boast that he will be the first to strike a blow in a battle, that he would claim a renowned sword from an enemy warrior as spoil of battle, that he will slay a particular monster that has been wreaking havoc on a town or village, and so on. ''Bēot''s were usually accompanied by grand stories of one's past glorious deeds. Although other cultures and times might disdain boasting as a sign of arrogance, or sinful pride, the pagan Anglo-Saxons highly regarded such behavior as a positive sign of one's determination, bravery, and character.

Examples of the ''bēot'' can be seen throughout the epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', such as when Beowulf vows to fight [[Grendel]] without using any weapons or armor.&lt;ref&gt;Einarsson, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[Old English]] word ''bēot'' comes from earlier ''bíhát'' meaning ‘promise’. The original noun-form of ''bēot'' corresponds to the verb ''bi-'', ''be-ˈhátan''. A shifting of the stress from ''bíhát'' to ''bi-ˈhát'', on analogy of the verb, gave the late [[Old English]] ''beˈhát'', from which the [[Middle English]] word ''behote'' derives.&lt;ref&gt;http://oed.com/view/Entry/17815?redirectedFrom=beot# Retrieved 06FEB2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of a ''bēot''==
# '''Pledge''' - The individual pledges to endeavor a specific challenge&lt;ref&gt;[[Beowulf]], lines 679-685&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beowulf, lines 2510-2525&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Einarsson 1934 p975-976"&gt;Einarsson, 1934, p. 975-976, "In both instances we have to do with a solemn promise to carry out a feat—a fight—under very difficult circumstances, partly self-imposed to add glory"&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Speculation of outcomes''' - The individual predicts two possible outcomes—success or failure—and elaborates the effects of either outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Beowulf, line 687&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beowulf, lines 2535-2537&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Commissioning to a higher power''' - The individual commissions the outcome of the challenge to a higher power (e.g. ''God'', ''fate'').&lt;ref&gt;Beowulf, lines 685-687&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beowulf, lines 2526-2527&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Evidence law}}
The '''burden of proof''' ({{lang-la|onus probandi}}) is the obligation of a [[party (law)|party]] in a [[trial]] to produce the [[evidence]] that will prove the claims they have made against the other party. In a legal dispute, one party is initially presumed to be correct and gets the benefit of the doubt, while the other side bears the burden of proof. When a party bearing the burden of proof meets its burden, the burden of proof switches to the other side. Burdens may be of different kinds for each party, in different phases of litigation. The [[Prima facie|burden of production]] is a minimal burden to produce at least enough evidence for the [[trier of fact]] to ''consider'' a disputed claim.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;''Criminal Law - Cases and Materials'', 7th ed. 2012, [[Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business]]; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], Guyora Binder, {{ISBN|978-1-4548-0698-1}}, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16–17}} After litigants have met the burden of production and their claim is being considered by a trier of fact, they have the burden of persuasion, that enough evidence has been presented to persuade the trier of fact that their side is correct. There are different ''standards'' of persuasiveness ranging from a [[preponderance of the evidence]], where there is just enough evidence to tip the balance, to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, as in United States criminal courts.&lt;ref name="CL"/&gt;{{rp|17}}

The burden of proof is always on the person who brings a claim in a dispute. It is often associated with the Latin [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] ''semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit'', a translation of which in this context is: "the necessity of proof always lies with the person who lays charges."&lt;ref&gt;Transnational principle of law: [http://www.trans-lex.org/966000 Trans-Lex.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The party that does not carry the burden of proof carries the benefit of assumption of being correct, they are presumed to be correct, until the burden shifts after presentation of evidence by the party bringing the action. An example is in an American [[criminal case]], where there is a [[presumption of innocence]] by the [[defendant]]. Fulfilling the burden of proof effectively captures the benefit of assumption, passing the burden of proof off to another party.

==Definition==
The term "burden of proof" is used to mean two kinds of burdens: The burden of production (or the burden of "going forward with the evidence") and the burden of persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;Barron's Law Dictionary, pp. 55-56 (2nd ed. 1984); Black's Law Dictionary, p. 178 (5th ed. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

A "burden of persuasion" or "risk of nonpersuasion"&lt;ref&gt;Barron's Law Dictionary, p. 55 (2nd ed. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; is an obligation that remains on a single party for the duration of the court proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, p. 178 (5th ed. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Once the burden has been entirely discharged to the satisfaction of the [[trier of fact]], the party carrying the burden will succeed in its claim. For example, the [[presumption of innocence]] in a criminal case places a legal burden upon the prosecution to prove all elements of the offense (generally beyond a reasonable doubt), and to disprove all the defenses except for [[affirmative defense]]s in which the proof of non-existence of all affirmative defense(s) is not constitutionally required of the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;''Patterson v. New York'', {{ussc|432|197|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The burden of persuasion should not be confused with the [[evidential burden]], or burden of production, or duty of producing (or going forward with evidence)&lt;ref&gt;Barron's Law Dictionary, p. 56 (2nd ed. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; which is an obligation that may shift between parties over the course of the hearing or trial. The evidential burden is the burden to adduce sufficient evidence to properly raise an issue at court.

==Standard of proof in the United States==
Burden of proof refers most generally to the obligation of a party to prove its allegations at trial. In a civil case, the plaintiff sets forth its allegations in a complaint, petition or other pleading. The defendant is then required to file a responsive pleading denying some or all of the allegations and setting forth any [[affirmative defenses|affirmative facts in defense]]. Each party has the burden of proof of its allegations.

===Legal standards for burden of proof===
====Some evidence====
Per ''{{w|Superintendent v. Hill}}'' (1985), in order to take away a prisoner's {{w|good conduct time}} for a disciplinary violation, prison officials need only have "some evidence," i.e., "a modicum of evidence".

Per ''{{w|Thompson v. City of Louisville}}'' (1960), the some evidence standard is required to overrule a jury's finding of guilt in criminal cases.

====Reasonable indications====
"Reasonable indication is substantially lower than probable cause; factors to consider are those facts and circumstances a prudent investigator would consider, but must include facts or circumstances indicating a past, current, or impending violation; an objective factual basis must be present, a mere 'hunch' is insufficient."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hirsch Ballin|first1=Marianne|title=Anticipative Criminal Investigation: Theory and Counterterrorism Practice in the Netherlands and the United States|date=Mar 6, 2012|page=525|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGExJeGdVF0C&amp;lpg=PA524&amp;ots=Fe-QCWeGvn&amp;dq=%22reasonable%20indications%22%20crime&amp;pg=PA524#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasonable indication standard is used in interpreting trade law in determining if the United States has been materially injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pak|first1=Nam|title=American Lamb Company v. United States: Application of the Reasonable Indication Standard|journal=Northwest Journal of International Law and Business|date=1988|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/njilb/vol9/iss1/11|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reasonable suspicion====
{{Main|Reasonable suspicion}}
Reasonable suspicion is a low standard of proof to determine whether a ''brief'' investigative stop or search by a police officer or any government agent is warranted. It is important to note that this stop or search must be brief; its thoroughness is proportional to, and limited by, the low standard of evidence. A more definite standard of proof (often [[probable cause]]) would be required to justify a more thorough stop/search. In ''[[Terry v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|392|1|1968}}, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that reasonable suspicion requires specific, articulable, and individualized suspicion that crime is afoot. A mere guess or "hunch" is not enough to constitute reasonable suspicion.

An investigatory stop is a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The state must justify the seizure by showing that the officer conducting the stop had a reasonable articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. The important point is that officers cannot deprive a citizen of liberty unless the officer can point to specific facts and circumstances and inferences therefrom that would amount to a reasonable suspicion. The officer must be prepared to establish that criminal activity was a logical explanation for what he perceived. The requirement serves to prevent officers from stopping individuals based merely on hunches or unfounded suspicions. The purpose of the stop and detention is to investigate to the extent necessary to confirm or dispel the original suspicion. If the initial confrontation with the person stopped dispels suspicion of criminal activity the officer must end the detention and allow the person to go about his or her business. If the investigation confirms the officer's initial suspicion or reveals evidence that would justify continued detention the officer may require the person detained to remain at the scene until further investigation is complete.

====Reasonable to believe====
In ''[[Arizona v. Gant]]'' (2009), the United States Supreme Court defined a new standard, that of "reasonable to believe." This standard applies only to vehicle searches after the suspect has been placed under arrest. The Court overruled ''[[New York v. Belton]]'' (1981) and concluded that police officers are allowed to go back and search a vehicle incident to a suspect's arrest only where it is "reasonable to believe" that there is more evidence in the vehicle of the crime for which the suspect was arrested.

There is still an ongoing debate as to the exact meaning of this phrase. Some courts have said it should be a new standard while others have equated it with the "reasonable suspicion" of the ''Terry'' stop. Most courts have agreed it is somewhere less than probable cause.

====Probable cause====
{{main|Probable cause}}
Probable cause is a relatively low standard of proof, which is used in the United States to determine whether a search, or an arrest, is warranted. It is also used by [[grand jury|grand juries]] to determine whether to issue an [[indictment]]. In the civil context, this standard is often used where plaintiffs are seeking a prejudgement [[remedy (law)|remedy]].

In the criminal context, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''United States v. Sokolow'', {{ussc|490|1|1989}}, determined that probable cause requires "a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found" in deciding whether [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] agents had a reason to execute a search. Courts vary when determining what constitutes a "fair probability": some{{Who|date=August 2012}} say 30%, others 40%, others 51%.

A good illustration of this evidence/intrusiveness continuum might be a typical police/citizen interaction. Consider the following three interactions:
* '''no level of suspicion required''': a consensual encounter between officer and citizen
* '''reasonable suspicion required''': a stop initiated by the officer that would cause a reasonable person not to feel free to leave
* '''probable cause required''': arrest.

====Some credible evidence====
One of the least reliable standards of proof, this assessment is often used in administrative law, and often in [[Child Protective Services]] (CPS) proceedings in some states. The "some credible evidence" standard is used as a legal placeholder to bring some controversy before a trier of fact, and into a legal process. It is on the order of the factual standard of proof needed to achieve a finding of "probable cause" used in ex parte threshold determinations needed before a court will issue a search warrant. It is a lower standard of proof than the "preponderance of the evidence" standard. The standard does not require the fact-finder to weigh conflicting evidence, and merely requires the investigator or prosecutor to present the bare minimum of material credible evidence to support the allegations against the subject, or in support of the allegation; see ''Valmonte v. Bane,'' 18 F.3d 992 (2nd Cir. 1994). In some Federal Appellate Circuit Courts, such as the Second Circuit, the "some credible evidence" standard has been found constitutionally insufficient to protect liberty interests of the parties in controversy at CPS hearings.

====Substantial evidence====
In some appeals from decisions of [[administrative agencies]], the courts apply a "substantial evidence" [[standard of review]] of the agency's factual findings. In the United States, for example, if a [[Social Security Disability Insurance]] claimant is found "not disabled" (and, therefore, ineligible for benefits) by an [[administrative law judge|Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)]] and the claimant appeals, both the Appeals Council (the body within the [[Social Security Administration]] that hears appeals from decisions of ALJs) and the [[United States Federal courts|Federal courts]] (which, in this type of case, will normally hear an appeal only after the claimant has [[exhaustion of remedies|exhausted all administrative remedies]]) will look to see whether the administrative law judge's decision was supported by "substantial evidence" or not. Substantial evidence is "more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion."&lt;ref&gt;''See'' ''[[Richardson v. Perales]]'', [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10758399444677950472&amp;q=%22substantial+evidence%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,9 402 U.S. 389, 401] (1971), ''quoting from'' ''[[Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB]]'', 305 U. S. 197, 229 (1938).&lt;/ref&gt;

This applies to other court decisions. The trier of fact's decision cannot be baseless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/12431.htm|website=California Courts|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{vanchor|Preponderance of the evidence}}====
Preponderance of the evidence, also known as '''balance of probabilities''', is the standard required in most [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] cases and in [[family court]] determinations solely involving money, such as [[child support]] under the [[Child Support Standards Act]]. It is also the burden of proof of which the defendant must prove [[affirmative defenses]] or  [[mitigating circumstances]] in civil or criminal court. In civil court, [[aggravating circumstances]] also only have to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence, as opposed to beyond reasonable doubt (as they do in criminal court).

The standard is met if the proposition is [[Probability|more likely]] to be true than not true. The standard is satisfied if there is greater than fifty percent chance that the proposition is true. [[Tom Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]], in ''Miller v. Minister of Pensions'',&lt;ref&gt;''Miller v. Minister of Pensions'' [1947] 2 All ER 372&lt;/ref&gt; described it simply as "more probable than not." Until 1970, this was also the standard used in juvenile court in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068 (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

This is also the standard of proof used when determining eligibility of unemployment benefits for a former employee accused of losing the job through alleged misconduct. In most US states, the employer must prove this case with a preponderance of evidence.

Preponderance of the evidence is the standard of proof used for immunity from prosecution under Florida's controversial [[stand-your-ground law]]. The defense must present its evidence in a pre-trial hearing, show that the statutory prerequisites have been met, and then request that the court grant a motion for declaration of immunity. The judge must then decide from the preponderance of the evidence whether to grant immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.husseinandwebber.com/stand_your_ground.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104224306/http://www.husseinandwebber.com/stand_your_ground.html |archivedate=2013-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a far lower burden than "beyond a reasonable doubt," the threshold a prosecutor must meet at any proceeding criminal trial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/florida-stand-your-ground-law-yields-some-shocking-outcomes-depending-on/1233133|title=Florida 'stand your ground' law yields some shocking outcomes depending on how law is applied|work=Tampa Bay Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; but higher than the "probable cause" threshold generally required for [[indictment]].

====Clear and convincing evidence====
Clear and convincing evidence is a higher level of burden of persuasion than "preponderance of the evidence". It is employed intra-adjudicatively in administrative court determinations, as well as in [[civil procedure|civil]] and certain [[criminal procedure]] in the United States. For example, a prisoner seeking ''[[habeas corpus]]'' relief from [[Capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]] must prove his factual innocence by clear and convincing evidence.&lt;ref&gt;''Calderon v. Thompson'', {{ussc|523|538|1998}}. The petitioner, Thomas M. Thompson, a convicted rapist/murderer, was executed on July 14, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

This standard is used in many types of [[Equity (law)|equity]] cases, including [[paternity (law)|paternity]], [[persons in need of supervision]], [[juvenile delinquency]], [[child custody]], the [[probate]] of both wills and [[living wills]], petitions to remove a person from [[life support]] ("[[right to die]]" cases),&lt;ref&gt;See, ''[[Quinlan case#Legal battle|Quinlan v. New Jersey]]'', and ''[[Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health]]'', 497 U.S. 261 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; and many similar cases.

Clear and convincing proof means that the evidence presented by a party during the trial must be highly and substantially more probable to be true than not and the trier of fact must have a firm belief or conviction in its factuality. In this standard, a greater degree of believability must be met than the common standard of proof in civil actions, which only requires that the facts as a threshold be more likely than not to prove the issue for which they are asserted.

This standard is also known as "clear, convincing, and satisfactory evidence"; "clear, cognizant, and convincing evidence"; and "clear, unequivocal, satisfactory, and convincing evidence", and is applied in cases or situations involving an equitable remedy or where a presumptive civil liberty interest exists.

====Beyond reasonable doubt====
{{main|Reasonable doubt}}

This is the highest standard used as the burden of proof in Anglo-American jurisprudence and typically only applies in criminal proceedings and when considering [[aggravating circumstances]] in criminal proceedings. It has been described, in negative terms, as a proof having been met if there is no plausible reason to believe otherwise. If there is a real doubt, based upon reason and common sense after careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence, or lack of evidence, in a case, then the level of proof has not been met.

Proof beyond a reasonable doubt, therefore, is proof of such a convincing character that one would be willing to rely and act upon it without hesitation in the most important of one's own affairs. However, it does not mean an absolute certainty. The standard that must be met by the prosecution's evidence in a criminal prosecution is that no other logical explanation can be derived from the facts except that the defendant committed the crime, thereby overcoming the presumption that a person is innocent unless and until proven guilty.

If the trier of fact has no doubt as to the defendant's guilt, or if their only doubts are unreasonable doubts, then the prosecutor has proved the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and the defendant should be pronounced guilty.

The term connotes that evidence establishes a particular point to a moral certainty which precludes the existence of any reasonable alternatives. It does not mean that no doubt exists as to the accused's guilt, but only that no ''reasonable'' doubt is possible from the evidence presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|55|1971|litigants=Green v The Queen |parallelcite=(1971) 126 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 28 at p. 33 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further to this notion of moral certainty, where the trier of fact relies on proof that is solely circumstantial, ''i.e.'', when conviction is based entirely on [[circumstantial evidence]], certain jurisdictions specifically require the prosecution's burden of proof to be such that the facts proved must exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable hypothesis or inference other than guilt.

The main reason that this high level of proof is demanded in criminal trials is that such proceedings can result in the deprivation of a defendant's liberty or even in his or her death. These outcomes are far more severe than in civil trials, in which monetary damages are the common remedy.

Another noncriminal instance in which proof beyond a reasonable doubt is applied is [[Conservatorship|LPS conservatorship]].

==Standard of proof in the United Kingdom==
In the three jurisdictions of the UK (Northern Ireland; England &amp; Wales; and Scotland) there are only two standards of proof in trials. (There are others which are defined in statutes, such as those relating to police powers.)

The criminal standard was formerly described as "beyond reasonable doubt". That standard remains, and the words commonly used, though the Judicial Studies Board guidance is that juries might be assisted by being told that to convict they must be persuaded "so that you are sure".

The civil standard is 'the balance of probabilities', often referred to in judgments as "more likely than not".

The civil standard is also used in criminal trials in relation to those defences which must be proven by the defendant (for example, the statutory defence to [[Driving under the influence#United Kingdom|drunk in charge]] that there was no likelihood of the accused driving while still over the alcohol limit&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/5 s.5 Road Traffic Act 1988]; see [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldjudgmt/jd041014/gen4-1.htm R. vs Sheldrake])&lt;/ref&gt;). However, where the law does not stipulate a reverse burden of proof, the defendant need only raise the issue and it is then for the prosecution to negate the defence to the criminal standard in the usual way (for example, that of self-defence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/self_defence/#Burden_of_Proof|title=Self-Defence and the Prevention of Crime - The Crown Prosecution Service|author=|date=|website=www.cps.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Prior to the decision of the House of Lords in ''Re B (A Child)'' [2008] UKHL 35&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldjudgmt/jd080611/child-1.htm|title=House of Lords -   In Re B (Children) (Fc)    Appellate Committee    Lord Hoffmann  Lord Scott of Foscote  Lord R|work=parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; there had been some confusion – even at the Court of Appeal – as to whether there was some intermediate standard, described as the 'heightened standard'. The House of Lords found that there was not. As the above description of the American system shows, anxiety by judges to make decisions on very serious matters on the basis of the balance of probabilities had led to a departure from the common law principles of just two standards. [[Baroness Hale]] said:

{{quote|70. ... Neither the seriousness of the allegation nor the seriousness of the consequences should make any difference to the standard of proof to be applied in determining the facts. The inherent probabilities are simply something to be taken into account, where relevant, in deciding where the truth lies.

72. ... there is no logical or necessary connection between seriousness and probability. Some seriously harmful behaviour, such as murder, is sufficiently rare to be inherently improbable in most circumstances. Even then there are circumstances, such as a body with its throat cut and no weapon to hand, where it is not at all improbable. Other seriously harmful behaviour, such as alcohol or drug abuse, is regrettably all too common and not at all improbable. Nor are serious allegations made in a vacuum. Consider the famous example of the animal seen in Regent’s Park. If it is seen outside the zoo on a stretch of greensward regularly used for walking dogs, then of course it is more likely to be a dog than a lion. If it is seen in the zoo next to the lions’ enclosure when the door is open, then it may well be more likely to be a lion than a dog.}}

The task for the tribunal then when faced with serious allegations is to recognise that their seriousness generally means they are inherently unlikely, such that to be satisfied that a fact is more likely than not the evidence must be of a good quality. But the standard of proof remains 'the balance of probabilities'.

==Other standards for presenting cases or defenses==

===Air of reality===
&lt;!-- [[Air of reality]] redirects here --&gt;
{{see also|R v Cinous}}

The "air of reality" is a standard of proof used in [[Canada]] to determine whether a criminal defense may be used. The test asks whether a defense can be successful if it is assumed that all the claimed facts are to be true. In most cases, the burden of proof rests solely on the prosecution, negating the need for a defense of this kind. However, when exceptions arise and the burden of proof has been shifted to the defendant, they are required to establish a defense that bears an "air of reality." Two instances in which such a case might arise are, first, when a ''[[prima facie#Burden of proof|prima facie]]'' case has been made against the defendant or, second, when the defense mounts an [[affirmative defense]], such as the [[insanity defense]].

===Evidentiary standards of proof===
Depending on the legal venue or intra-case hearing, varying levels of reliability of proof are considered dispositive of the inquiry being entertained. If the subject threshold level of reliability has been met by the presentation of the evidence, then the thing is considered legally proved for that trial, hearing or inquest.  For example, in California, several evidentiary presumptions are codified, including a presumption that the owner of legal title is the beneficial owner (rebuttable only by clear and convincing evidence).&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Evid. Code Section 662, available at http://legalmasters.net/practices/real-estate-law/commonly-referenced-real-estate-statutes-and-regulations/california-evidence-code-sections-660-668/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Criminal law===
In the [[Western world|West]], [[criminal law|criminal]] cases usually place the burden of proof on the [[prosecutor]] (expressed in the [[List of legal Latin terms|Latin]] [[Brocard (law)|brocard]] '''''[[ei incumbit probatio qui dicit]], non qui negat''''', "the burden of proof rests on who asserts, not on who denies"). This principle is known as the [[presumption of innocence]], and is summed up with "innocent until proven guilty," but is not upheld in all legal systems or [[jurisdiction]]s. Where it is upheld, the accused will be found not guilty if this burden of proof is not sufficiently shown by the prosecution.
&lt;ref name=Bailii&gt;{{cite web|title=Woolmington v DPP [1935] UKHL 1|url=http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/uk/cases/UKHL/1935/1.html&amp;query=woolmington&amp;method=boolean}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The presumption of innocence means three things:
* With respect to the critical facts of a case the defendant has no burden of proof whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;The critical facts of a criminal case are whether the crime charged was committed and whether the defendant is criminally responsible for the commission of the crime.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The state must prove the critical facts of the case to the appropriate level of certainty.
* The jury is not to draw any inferences adverse to the defendant from the fact that he has been charged with a crime and is present in court facing the charges against him.

For example, if the defendant (D) is charged with murder, the prosecutor (P) bears the burden of proof to show the jury that D did indeed murder someone.
* Burden of proof: P
** Burden of production: P has to show some evidence that D had committed murder. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution requires enough evidence to justify a rational trier of fact to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. If the judge rules that such burden has been met, then it is up to the jury itself to decide if they are, in fact, convinced of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;ref&gt;''Jackson v. Virginia'', {{ussc|443|307|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If the judge finds there is not enough evidence under the standard, the case must be dismissed (or a subsequent guilty verdict must be vacated and the charges dismissed).
*** e.g. [[witness]], [[forensic evidence]], [[autopsy]] report
*** Failure to meet the burden: the issue will be decided as a matter of law. In this case, D is presumed innocent
** Burden of persuasion: if at the close of evidence, the jury cannot decide if P has established with relevant level of certainty that D had committed murder, the jury must find D not guilty of the crime of murder
*** Measure of proof: P has to prove every element of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt, but not necessarily prove every single fact beyond a reasonable doubt.

However, in [[England and Wales]], the [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]], s.101 stipulates that where a defendant relies on some "exception, exemption, proviso, excuse or qualification" in his defence, the legal burden of proof as to that exception falls on the defendant, though only on the balance of probabilities. For example, a person charged with being [[drunk in charge]] of a motor vehicle can raise the defence that there was no likelihood of his driving while drunk.&lt;ref&gt;Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988, s.5(2)&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution has the legal burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant exceeded the legal limit of alcohol and was in control of a motor vehicle. Possession of the keys is usually sufficient to prove control, even if the defendant is not in the vehicle and is perhaps in a nearby bar. That being proved, the defendant has the legal burden of proof on the balance of probabilities that he was not likely to drive.&lt;ref name="herring"&gt;{{cite book |author=Herring, J. |year=2004 |title=Criminal Law: Text, Cases, and Materials |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-876578-9 |pages=58–64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, such practice in England and Wales was challenged as contrary to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR), art.6(2) guaranteeing right to a fair trial. The [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] held that:&lt;ref name="herring" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v. DPP, Ex Parte Kebeline'' [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/43.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[1999]&lt;/nowiki&gt; UKHL 43]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A mere evidential burden did not contravene art.6(2);
* A legal / persuasive burden did not necessarily contravene art.6(2) so long as confined within reasonable limits, considering the questions:
** ''What must the prosecution prove to transfer burden to the defendant?''
** ''Is the defendant required to prove something difficult or easily within his access?''
** ''What threat to society is the provision designed to combat?''

In some cases, there is a [[reverse onus]] on the accused.  A typical example is that of a [[Hit and run#Canada|hit-and-run]] charge prosecuted under the Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']].  The defendant is presumed to have fled the scene of a crash, to avoid civil or criminal liability, if the prosecution can prove the remaining essential elements of the offence.

===Civil law===
In [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] cases, the "burden of proof" requires the plaintiff to convince the trier of fact (whether judge or jury) of the plaintiff's entitlement to the relief sought.  This means that the plaintiff must prove each element of the claim, or cause of action, in order to recover. However, in cases of proving loss of future earning capacity, the plaintiff must prove there is a real or substantial possibility of such a loss occurring.

===Civil cases of the U.S. Supreme Court===
In ''Keyes v. Sch. Dist. No. 1'', {{ussc|413|189|1973}}, the [[United States Supreme Court]] stated: "There are no hard-and-fast standards governing the allocation of the burden of proof in every situation. The issue, rather, 'is merely a question of policy and fairness based on experience in the different situations.'" For support, the Court cited 9 John H. Wigmore, Evidence § 2486, at 275 (3d ed. 1940). In ''Keyes'', the Supreme Court held that if "school authorities have been found to have practised purposeful segregation in part of a school system," the burden of persuasion shifts to the school to prove that it did not engage in such discrimination in other segregated schools in the same system.

In ''Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Greenwich Collieries'', {{ussc|512|267|1994}}, the Supreme Court explained that ''burden of proof'' is ambiguous because it has historically referred to two distinct burdens:  the ''burden of persuasion'', and the ''burden of production''.

The Supreme Court discussed how courts should allocate the burden of proof (i.e., the burden of persuasion) in ''Schaffer ex rel. Schaffer v. Weast'', {{ussc|546|49|2005}}. The Supreme Court explained that if a statute is silent about the burden of persuasion, the court will "begin with the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims." In support of this proposition, the Court cited 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence § 337, 412 (5th ed. 1999), which states:

{{quote|The burdens of pleading and proof with regard to most facts have been and should be assigned to the plaintiff who generally seeks to change the present state of affairs and who therefore naturally should be expected to bear the risk of failure of proof or persuasion.}}

At the same time, the Supreme Court also recognized "The ordinary default rule, of course, admits of exceptions. ... For example, the burden of persuasion as to certain elements of a plaintiff's claim may be shifted to defendants, when such elements can fairly be characterized as affirmative defenses or exemptions. See, e.g., ''FTC v. Morton Salt Co.'', 334 U.S. 37, 44-45 (1948). Under some circumstances this Court has even placed the burden of persuasion over an entire claim on the defendant. See ''Alaska Dept. of Environmental Conservation v. EPA'', {{ussc|540|461|2004}}." Nonetheless, "[a]bsent some reason to believe that Congress intended otherwise, therefore, [the Supreme Court] will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it usually falls, upon the party seeking relief."{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

'''''{{lang|la|Ceteris paribus}}''''' or '''''{{lang|la|caeteris paribus}}''''' is a [[Latin]] phrase meaning "other things equal".  English translations of the phrase include "'''all other things being equal'''" or "'''other things held constant'''" or "'''all else unchanged'''". A prediction or a statement about a [[ontic|causal]], [[epistemic|empirical]], or [[inductive logic|logical]] relation between two states of affairs is ''ceteris paribus'' if it is acknowledged that the prediction, although usually accurate in expected conditions, can fail or the relation can be abolished by intervening factors.&lt;ref name="Schlicht000"&gt;{{cite book | author=Schlicht, E. | title=Isolation and Aggregation in Economics | year=1985 | publisher = Springer Verlag | isbn = 0-387-15254-7 | url=http://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/archive/00000003/}} chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''ceteris paribus'' assumption''' is often key to scientific inquiry, as scientists seek to screen out factors that perturb a relation of interest.  Thus, [[epidemiologist]]s for example may seek to control [[independent variable]]s as factors that may influence [[dependent variables]]—the outcomes or effects of interest.  Likewise, in [[scientific modeling]], simplifying assumptions permit illustration or elucidation of concepts thought relevant within the sphere of inquiry.

There is ongoing debate in the philosophy of science concerning ''ceteris paribus'' statements. On the [[Logical positivism|logical empiricist]] view, [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]] tends to state universal laws, whereas other sciences, such as biology, psychology, and economics, tend to state laws that hold true in normal conditions but have exceptions, '''''ceteris paribus'' laws''' (cp laws).&lt;ref name=Stanford2014&gt;Alexander Reutlinger, Gerhard Schurz &amp; Andreas Hüttemann, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/ceteris-paribus "Ceteris paribus laws"], in Edward N Zalta, ed, ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Spring 2014 edn.&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus on universal laws is a criterion distinguishing fundamental physics as [[fundamental science]], whereas cp laws are predominant in most other sciences as [[special science]]s, whose laws hold in special cases.&lt;ref name=Stanford2014/&gt; This distinction assumes a [[logical empiricist]] view of science. It does not readily apply in a mechanistic understanding of scientific discovery. There is reasonable disagreement as to whether mechanisms or laws are the appropriate model, though mechanisms are the favored method.&lt;ref name=glennan2014&gt;Glennan, S. (2014). Mechanisms. In M. Curd &amp; S. Psillos (eds.), ''The Routledge companion to philosophy of
science'' (2nd ed., pp. 420–428). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics ==

=== Interpretation ===
One of the disciplines in which ''ceteris paribus'' clauses are most widely used is [[economics]], in which they are employed to simplify the formulation and description of economic outcomes. When using ''ceteris paribus'' in economics, one assumes that all other variables except those under immediate consideration are held constant. For example, it can be predicted that if the price of [[beef]] ''increases''—''ceteris paribus''—the quantity of beef demanded by buyers will ''decrease''. In this example, the clause is used to operationally describe everything surrounding the relationship between both the ''price'' and the ''quantity demanded'' of an [[ordinary good]].

This operational description intentionally ignores both known and unknown factors that may also influence the relationship between price and quantity demanded, and thus to assume ''ceteris paribus'' is to assume away any interference with the given example. Such factors that would be intentionally ignored include: a change in the price of substitute goods, (e.g., the price of pork or lamb); a change in the level of [[risk aversion]] among buyers (e.g., due to an increase in the fear of [[mad cow disease]]); and a change in the level of overall demand for a good regardless of its current price (e.g., a societal shift toward [[vegetarianism]]).

The clause is often loosely translated as "holding all else constant." It does not imply that no other things will in fact change; rather, it isolates the effect of one particular change. Holding all other things constant  is directly analogous to using a [[partial derivative]] in [[calculus]] rather than a [[total derivative]],  and to running a [[regression analysis|regression]] containing multiple variables rather than just one in order to isolate the individual effect of one of the variables.

=== Characterization given by Alfred Marshall ===

The clause is used to consider the effect of some causes in isolation, by assuming that other influences are absent. [[Alfred Marshall]]  expressed the use of the clause as follows:

:The element of time is a chief cause of those difficulties in economic investigations which make it necessary for man with his limited powers to go step by step; breaking up a complex question, studying one bit at a time, and at last combining his partial solutions into a more or less complete solution of the whole riddle. In breaking it up, he segregates those disturbing causes, whose wanderings happen to be inconvenient, for the time in a pound called Ceteris Paribus. The study of some group of tendencies is isolated by the assumption other things being equal: the existence of other tendencies is not denied, but their disturbing effect is neglected for a time. The more the issue is thus narrowed, the more exactly can it be handled: but also the less closely does it correspond to real life. I.e. The more we apply the rule of ceteris paribus the further we distance ourselves from reality, e.g. If hydrocarbon fuels are infinite then society is sustainable. 
Each exact and firm handling of a narrow issue, however, helps towards treating broader issues, in which that narrow issue is contained, more exactly than would otherwise have been possible. With each step more things can be let out of the pound; exact discussions can be made less abstract, realistic discussions can be made less inexact than was possible at an earlier stage. ([http://www.econlib.org/library/Marshall/marP.html Principles of Economics, Bk.V,Ch.V in paragraph V.V.10]).

=== Two uses ===

The above passage by Marshall highlights two ways in which the ''ceteris paribus'' clause may be used: The one is ''hypothetical'', in the sense that some factor is assumed fixed in order to analyse the influence of another factor in isolation. This would be '''hypothetical isolation'''. An example would be the hypothetical separation of the [[income effect]] and the [[substitution effect]] of a price change, which actually go together. The other use of the ''ceteris paribus'' clause is to see it as a means for obtaining an approximate solution. Here it would yield a '''substantive isolation'''.

Substantive isolation has two aspects: temporal and causal. '''Temporal isolation''' requires the factors fixed under the ''ceteris paribus'' clause to actually move so slowly relative to the other influence that they can be taken as practically constant at any point in time. So, if [[vegetarianism]] spreads very slowly, inducing a slow decline in the demand for beef, and the market for beef clears comparatively quickly, we can determine the price of beef at any instant by the intersection of supply and demand, and the changing demand for beef will account for the price changes over time ([[Temporary Equilibrium Method]]).

The other aspect of substantive isolation is '''causal isolation''': those factors frozen under a ''ceteris paribus'' clause should not significantly be affected by the processes under study. If a change in government policies induces changes in consumers' behaviour on the same time scale, the assumption that consumer behaviour remains unchanged while policy changes is inadmissible as a substantive isolation ([[Lucas critique]]).

The '''Cologne Diocesan Feud''' ({{lang-de|Kölner Stiftsfehde}}, or ''Stiftsfehde zu Köln''), also called the '''Neuss War''' (''Neusser Krieg'') or '''Burgundian War''' (''Burgundischer Krieg''), was a conflict, which began in 1473, between the [[Archbishop of Cologne]], [[Ruprecht of the Palatinate (Cologne)|Ruprecht of the Palatinate]] and the ''[[Landstände]]'' of his [[Archbishopric of Cologne|archbishopric]] that began in 1473. As a result of the involvement of [[Charles the Bold]] of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and, eventually, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] the matter at times assumed a European dimension. It finally ended when Ruprecht died in 1480.

== Background ==
The background was that, after the death of {{Interlanguage link multi|Dietrich II of Moers|de|3=Dietrich II. von Moers}}, the estates in the secular dominion ("Archbishopric") of the Archbishop of Cologne banded together to form so-called "hereditary estate agreements" (''Erblandesvereinigungen''). The ''Erblandesvereinigung'' in the Diocese itself also joined the ecclesiastical territory of [[Vest Recklinghausen]]. In the [[Duchy of Westphalia]] the estates agreed their own ''Erblandesvereinigung''. These agreements had henceforth to be sworn by new archbishops in their role as territorial rulers. The ''Erblandesvereinigung'' envisaged that, in this case of important fiscal and public policy issues, the sovereign had to seek the permission of estates or ''[[Landstände]]''. Although Ruprecht came from the centre of the  [[cathedral chapter]], it was not long before he ignored the ''Erblandesvereinigung'' he had sworn. Instead he hired mercenaries from the Palatinate, with whom he intended to recapture the estates enfeoffed by previous archbishops. When he let a dispute occur over the raising of a poll and hearth tax on the town of [[Zons]], which was enfeoffed to the cathedral chapter, the conflict broke out openly. He also tried to take the town of [[Neuss]] by force. The ''Landstände'' saw the actions of the Archbishop as an infraction of ''Erblandesvereinigung'', relied on their right to opposition and deposed Ruprecht. In his place, in the spring of 1473, they elected [[Hermann of Hesse (1450-1508)|Hermann of Hesse]] as the administrator (''Stiftsverweser'') of the Diocese. The estates had strong support from the cities of Cologne and Neuss.

== Course ==
Ruprecht did not accept this and was also supported by the small and middle-ranking estates. In 1473, Hessian troops under [[Johann Schenk zu Schweinsberg]], sent to support the administrator, failed in their attempt to capture the town of [[Brilon]] in the Duchy of Westphalia, but then played an important role in the defence of Neuss. Ruprecht's situation improved as a result, because he was able to win the backing of Charles the Bold. The latter was even appointed as the "hereditary advocate" (''Erbvogt'') of the Diocese.

For his part, Charles the Bold saw a favourable opportunity to extend his power at the expense of the Diocese. The majority of the neighbouring territories were already in Burgundian hands. In addition, the [[Duchy of Cleves]] belonged to the allies. In 1473 after Charles the Bold also came into possession of the [[Duchy of Guelders]], the existence of the Diocese became threatened. The same year there was an attempt at the "Trier Meeting" (''Trierer Treffen'') to clarify the position of Charles the Bold and the Emperor and the prince-electors. This attempt at negotiation proved unsuccessful. In April and May 1474, [[Ahrweiler]] was besieged by troops sympathetic to Ruprecht. The town walls and guns fended the attacks off.

Charles the Bold marched out with an army that was one of the largest and best equipped of its time. In his support was [[Frederick I of the Palatinate|Frederick the Victorious]] of the Palatinate, brother of Archbishop Ruprecht, and the dukes of [[Duchy of Guelders|Guelders]] and [[Duchy of Cleves|Cleves]]. The allied troops jointly numbered about 13,000 to 20,000 men. Instead of marching on [[Cologne]] as Ruprecht had thought, the army advanced on Neuss, a town defended by Hermann of Hesse and his 4,000-man body of troops. Neuss was besieged in 1474/75 by the enemy forces (see the [[Siege of Neuss]]). The siege was ended by the delivery of an [[imperial ban]] by Emperor [[Frederick III (HRR)|Frederick III]]. This ended the Neuss War, but not the diocesan feud.

After the withdrawal of Burgundian troops, Ruprecht of the Palatinate still had available several supporters in the Upper Diocese (''Oberstift'') and in the Duchy of Westphalia. So he did not give up. However, his position was severely weakened by the death of Frederick the Victorious in 1476 and Charles the Bold a year later. In the territory of the Diocese itself he was now only able to control [[Kempen, Germany|Kempen]] and [[Altenahr]] whilst, outside, he still had several Westphalian estates. In 1478, he was taken prisoner by Hessian troops. However, initially the Hessians were unable to make gains in Westphalia. The Duke of Cleves, who fought on Ruprecht's side, was even able to occupy[[Arnsberg]] and [[Eversberg]] for a time.

After his capture, Ruprecht announced he was prepared to give up the office of archbishop. However, confirmation from the Pope in light of the difficult church legal situation - Ruprecht was not just the sovereign, but first and foremost a bishop - was taking a long time to arrive. Ruprecht's renunciation of the archbishop's office was also questionable, because he had come under external pressure. The death of Ruprecht on 26 July 1480 ended this tricky situation.

'''Congruence bias''' is a type of [[cognitive bias]] similar to [[confirmation bias]]. Congruence bias occurs due to people's overreliance on directly testing a given [[hypothesis]] as well as neglecting indirect testing.

==Examples==
Suppose that, in an [[experiment]]al setting, a subject is presented with two buttons and told that pressing one of those buttons, but not the other, will open a door. The subject adopts the hypothesis that the button on the left opens the door in question. A direct test of this hypothesis would be pressing the button on the left; an indirect test would be pressing the button on the right. The latter is still a valid test because once the result of the door's remaining closed is found, the left button is proven to be the desired button. (This example is parallel to Bruner, Goodnow, and Austin's example in the psychology classic, ''[[#CITEREFBrunerGoodnowAustin1956|A Study of Thinking]]''.)

It is possible to take this idea of direct and indirect testing and apply it to more complicated experiments in order to explain the presence of a congruence bias in people. In an experiment, a subject will test his own usually naive hypothesis again and again instead of trying to disprove it.

The classic example of subjects' congruence bias was discovered by [[Peter Cathcart Wason|Peter Wason]] ([[#CITEREFWason1960|1960]], [[#CITEREFWason1968|1968]]).  Here, the experimenter gave subjects the number sequence "2, 4, 6", telling the subjects that this sequence followed a particular rule and instructing subjects to find the rule underlying the sequence logic. Subjects provided their own number sequences as tests to see if they could ascertain the rule dictating which numbers could be included in the sequence and which could not. Most subjects respond to the task by quickly deciding that the underlying rule is "numbers ascending by 2", and provide as tests only sequences concordant with this rule, such as "3, 5, 7," or even "pi plus 2, plus 4, plus 6". Each of these sequences follows the underlying rule the experimenter is thinking of, though "numbers ascending by 2" is not the actual criterion being used. However, because subjects succeed at repeatedly testing the same singular principle, they naively believe their chosen hypothesis is correct. When a subject offers up to the experimenter the hypothesis "numbers ascending by 2" only to be told he is wrong, much confusion usually ensues. At this point, many subjects attempt to change the wording of the rule without changing its meaning, and even those who switch to indirect testing have trouble letting go of the "+ 2" convention, producing potential rules as idiosyncratic as "the first two numbers in the sequence are random, and the third number is the second number plus two". Many subjects never realize that the actual rule the experimenter was using was simply just to list ascending numbers, because of the subjects' inability to consider indirect tests of their hypotheses.

==Cognitive basis==
Wason attributed this failure of subjects to an inability to consider alternative hypotheses, which is the root of the congruence bias. [[Jonathan Baron]] explains that subjects could be said to be using a "congruence heuristic", wherein a hypothesis is tested only by thinking of results that would be found if that hypothesis is true. This heuristic, which many people seem to use, ignores alternative hypotheses.

Baron suggests the following heuristics to avoid falling into the congruence bias trap:
# Ask "How likely is a yes answer, if I assume that my hypothesis is false?" Remember to choose a test that has a high probability of giving some answer if the hypothesis is true, and a low probability if it is false.
# "Try to think of alternative hypotheses; then choose a test most likely to distinguish them—a test that will probably give different results depending on which is true." An example of the need for the heuristic could be seen in a doctor's attempting to diagnose [[appendicitis]]. In that situation, assessing a [[white blood cell]] count would not assist in diagnosis because an elevated white blood cell count is associated with a number of maladies.

      <comment>Added warning about EGA's use of retrocompact open subsets.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3405">:''For a [[Gödel constructive set]], see [[constructible universe]].''
In [[topology]], a '''constructible set''' in a [[topological space]] is a finite union of [[locally closed set]]s. (A set is locally closed if it is the intersection of an [[open set]] and [[closed set]], or equivalently, if it is open in its closure.) Constructible sets form a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] (i.e., it is closed under finite union and complementation.) In fact, the constructible sets are precisely the Boolean algebra generated by open sets and closed sets; hence, the name "constructible". The notion appears in classical [[algebraic geometry]].

Chevalley's theorem (EGA IV, 1.8.4.) states: Let &lt;math&gt;f: X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; be a morphism of finite presentation of schemes. Then the image of any constructible set under ''f'' is constructible. In particular, the image of a variety need not be a variety, but is (under the assumptions) always a constructible set. For example, the map &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A^2 \rightarrow \mathbf A^2&lt;/math&gt; that sends &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(x,xy)&lt;/math&gt; has image the set &lt;math&gt;\{ x \neq 0 \} \cup \{ x=y=0 \}&lt;/math&gt;, which is not a variety, but is constructible.

In any (not necessarily Noetherian) topological space, every constructible set contains a dense open subset of its closure.&lt;ref&gt;Jinpeng An (2012). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/73hg840753675717/ "Rigid geometric structures, isometric actions, and algebraic quotients"]. Geom. Dedicata '''157''': 153–185.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Warning:''' In EGA III, Def.9.1.2, constructible sets are defined using only ''retrocompact'' opens. That is, the family of constructible sets of a topological space is defined as the smallest family closed under finite intersection and complement and containing all ''retrocompact'' open subsets.

So for example, the origin &lt;math&gt;V(x_1, x_2, x_2, \dots)&lt;/math&gt; in the infinite affine space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}^{\infty} = Spec(k[x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots])&lt;/math&gt; is ''not'' constructible.

In any locally noetherian topological space, ''all'' subsets are retrocompact (EGA III, 9.1), so the two definitions are the same in this setting.

      <comment>/* The Dublin Principles */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3607">The '''Dublin Statement on Water and Sustainable Development''', also known as the '''Dublin Principles''', was a meeting of experts on water related problems that took place on 31 January 1992 at the International Conference on Water and the Environment (ICWE), Dublin, Ireland, organised on 26–31 January 1992.

The Dublin Statement on Water and Sustainable Development recognises the increasing [[water scarcity|scarcity of water]] as a result of the different conflicting uses and overuses of water.

== The Dublin Principles ==

The declaration sets out recommendations for action at local, national and international levels to reduce the scarcity, through the following four guiding principles:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wmo.ch/pages/prog/hwrp/documents/english/icwedece.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://docs.watsan.net/Scanned_PDF_Files/Class_Code_7_Conference/71-ICWE92-9739.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

#[[Fresh water]] is a [[finite resource|finite and vulnerable resource]], essential to sustain life, development and the environment
#[[Water development]] and [[water management|management]] should be based on a participatory approach, involving users, planners and policy-makers at all levels
#[[Women]] play a central part in the provision, management and safeguarding of water
#Water has an [[economic value]] in all its competing uses and should be recognized as an [[economic good]]

== Water as a human right or economic good? ==

The emphasis of the Dublin Statement on ''the economic value'' of water rather than water as ''a [[universal right]]'' is highly contested by [[NGO]]s and human rights activists (although the full text of principle 4 does state ''it is vital to recognize first the basic right of all human beings to have access to clean water and [[sanitation]] at an affordable price'')

In November 2002, however, the UN [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] adopted ''General Comment No. 15'', which was formulated by experts as a comment on articles 11 and 12 of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatercouncil.org/index.php?id%3D1764 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717002357/http://www.worldwatercouncil.org/index.php?id=1764 |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this comment, water is recognised not only as a limited natural resource and a public good but also as a [[human right]]. This step - adopting General Comment No. 15 - was seen as a decisive step towards the recognition of water as universal right.

On 30 September 2010, the 15th Session of the UN Human Rights Council passed Resolution A/HRC/15/L.14,&lt;ref&gt;http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/15/L.14&lt;/ref&gt; reaffirming an earlier General Assembly resolution (64/292 of 28 July 2010) which ''recognized the right to safe and clean [[drinking water]] and sanitation as a human right that is essential for the full enjoyment of life and all human rights''. Resolution A/HRC/15/L.14 clarifies that ''the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation is derived from the [[right to an adequate standard of living]] and inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of [[physical health|physical]] and [[mental health]], as well as the right to life and [[human dignity]]''.

'''Egalitarian communities''' are groups of people who have chosen to live together, with [[egalitarianism]] as one of their core values. A broad definition of egalitarianism is "equal access to resources and to decision-making power." For example, decision-making is done by [[consensus decision-making|consensus]] or another system in which each person has a voice; it is not done hierarchically with only one or a few people making choices that will affect the whole group. If the group shares assets (income, vehicles, etc.), they are distributed equitably throughout the group, and each member has access to more-or-less the same resources as any other member. Egalitarian communities are a type of [[commune]] (some communal groups are not egalitarian in nature).

An "egalitarian decision" is a decision made by a group as opposed to a single individual. The decision may be made by committee or elected members but still is an egalitarian decision.

The [[Federation of Egalitarian Communities]] is a network of communal groups in North America with values including egalitarianism, [[non-violence]], income-sharing and [[cooperation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6610">The '''furlong–firkin–fortnight''' ('''FFF''') '''system''' is a [[List of humorous units of measurement|humorous system of units]] based on unusual or impractical measurements. The length unit of the system is the [[furlong]], the mass unit is the mass of a [[English brewery cask units#Firkin|firkin]] of water, and the time unit is the [[fortnight]].&lt;ref name="SKB"&gt;Stan Kelly-Bootle, "[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1229919 As Big as a Barn?]", ''ACM Queue'', March 2007, pp. 62–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slade"/&gt; Like the [[International System of Units|SI]] or [[MKS system of units|meter–kilogram–second]] systems, there are derived units for [[velocity]], [[volume]], [[mass]] and [[weight]], etc.

While the FFF system is not used in practice, it has been used as an example in discussions of the relative merits of different systems of units.&lt;ref name="SKB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John D. Neff, "Imbedding the Metric", ''The Two-Year College Mathematics Journal'', Vol. 14, No. 3 (Jun., 1983), pp. 197–202.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the FFF units, notably the microfortnight, have been used jokingly in computer science. Besides having the meaning "any obscure unit",&lt;ref name="obscure"&gt;For example, in Jack G. Ganssle, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MMfCP3KTNZoC&amp;pg=PA50 The art of designing embedded systems]'', 2nd ed., Newnes, 2008, {{ISBN|0-7506-8644-8}}, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; the derived unit ''furlongs per fortnight'' has also served frequently in classroom examples of [[unit conversion]] and [[dimensional analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=College Physics |first=Alan |last=Giambattista |first2=Betty McCarthy |last2=Richardson |lastauthoramp=yes  |first3=Robert C. |last3=Richardson |location=Boston |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=2004 |page=20 |isbn=0-07-052407-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Thinking Like an Engineer: An Active Learning Approach |first=Elizabeth A.|last=Stephan|first2= William J. |last2=Park|lastauthoramp=yes  |first3=Benjamin L. |last3=Sill |first4=David R. |last4=Bowman |first5=Matthew W. |last5=Ohland|publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2010 |page=259 |isbn=0-13-606442-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SWGO4ZpQly4C&amp;pg=PA259 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable multiples and derived units==
===Microfortnight and other decimal prefixes ===
One '''microfortnight''' is equal to 1.2096 [[second]]s.&lt;ref name="Slade"&gt;Robert Slade, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mK2QhS11JtsC&amp;pg=PA122 Dictionary of information security]'', Syngress, 2006, {{ISBN|1-59749-115-2}}, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; This has become a joke in computer science because in the [[OpenVMS|VMS]] [[operating system]], the TIMEPROMPTWAIT variable, which holds the time the system will wait for an operator to set the correct date and time at boot if it realizes that the current value is bogus, is set in microfortnights.  This is because the computer uses [[busy waiting|a loop]] instead of the internal clock which has not been activated yet to run the timer.&lt;ref name=jargon&gt;{{cite web| url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/M/microfortnight.html| title=microfortnight| accessdate=2007-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentation notes that "[t]he time unit of micro-fortnights is approximated as seconds in the implementation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://h41379.www4.hpe.com/doc/84final/6048/6048pro_096.html| title=HP OpenVMS System Management Utilities Reference Manual |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824192345/http://h41379.www4.hpe.com/doc/84final/6048/6048pro_096.html |archive-date=2018-08-24 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Jargon File]]'' reports that  the millifortnight (about 20 minutes) and nanofortnight have been occasionally used.&lt;ref name=jargon/&gt;

===Furlongs per fortnight===
One '''furlong per fortnight''' is a speed which would be barely noticeable to the naked eye. It [[Conversion of units#Speed|converts]] to: 
*1.663&lt;!--1.6630952--&gt;{{e|−4}} [[meter per second]], (i.e. 0.1663&amp;nbsp;mm/s)
*roughly one [[centimeter]] per [[minute]] (to within 1 part in 400),&lt;ref&gt;Indeed, if the inch were defined as 2.5454... cm, it would be 1 cm/min. {{cite web| url=http://www.uk-rec-sheds.org.uk/faq60.txt| format=TXT| title=FAQ for newsgroup UK.rec.sheds, version 2&amp;3/7th| year=2000| accessdate=2006-03-10| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306161426/http://www.uk-rec-sheds.org.uk/faq60.txt| archivedate=2006-03-06| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*5.987&lt;!--5.9871429--&gt;{{e|−4}}&amp;nbsp;km/h, 
*roughly three eighths of an inch per minute, and
*3.720&lt;!--3.7202381--&gt;{{e|−4}} mph.

===Speed of light===
The [[speed of light]] is 1.8026&lt;!--1.8026--&gt;{{e|12}} furlongs/fortnight (1.8026 megafurlongs/microfortnight). By [[mass–energy equivalence]], 1 firkin is equal to 3.24936676{{e|24}} &lt;math&gt;{}\rm firkin {\cdot} \frac{furlongs^2}{fortnight^2}&lt;/math&gt; (approx. {{val|3.478|e=15|ul=BTU}} or {{val|3.669|e=18|ul=joules}}).

===Others===
In the FFF system, [[heat transfer coefficient]]s are conventionally reported as [[BTU]] per foot-fathom&lt;ref&gt;The foot-fathom is a unit of area: 1 foot-fathom = 6 square feet.&lt;/ref&gt; per degree [[Fahrenheit]] per fortnight.

Like the more common furlongs per fortnight,&lt;ref name="obscure"/&gt; '''firkins per fortnight''' have been used with the meaning "any obscure unit".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Fundamentals of object-oriented design in UML |first=Meilir |last=Page-Jones|first2= Larry L. |last2=Constantine|lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Addison–Wesley |year=2000 |page=235 |isbn=0-201-69946-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4995">'''False pleasure''' may be a [[pleasure]] based on a false belief (as of supposedly having come into money), or a pleasure compared with more real, or greater pleasures.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Blackburn, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy'' (2005) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] maintained that philosophers should seek to "discern not true pleasures from false, for such a distinction is impossible to make, but the true and false goods that pleasure points to".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Y. Stavrakakis, ''Lacan and the Political'' (1999) p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical philosophy==

[[Plato]] devoted much attention to the belief that "no pleasure save that of the wise is quite true and pure - all others are shadows only"&lt;ref&gt;Alain de Botton intro., ''The Essential Plato'' (1999) p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; - both in [[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]] and in his late dialogue [[Philebus]].&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine]] saw false pleasure as focused on the body, as well as pervading the dramatic and rhetorical entertainments of his time.&lt;ref&gt;B. Krondorfer, ''Male Confessions'' (2009) p. 83 and p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asceticism==

[[Buddhaghosa]] considered that "sense-pleasures are impermanent, deceptive, trivial...unstable, unreal, hollow, and uncertain"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in E. Conze ed., ''Buddhist Scriptures'' (1975) p. 108-9&lt;/ref&gt; - a view echoed in most of what [[Max Weber]] termed "world-rejecting asceticism".&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, ''The Sociology of Religion'' (1971) p. 166 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Vain pleasure==

A specific false pleasure often denounced in Western thought is the pleasure of [[vanity]] - [[Voltaire]] for example pillorying the character "corrupted by vanity...He breathed in nothing but false glory and false pleasures".&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire, ''Candide, Zadig, and Selected Stories'' (1961) p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly [[John Ruskin]] contrasted the adult's pursuit of the false pleasure of vanity with the way the child does not seek false pleasures; its pleasures are true, simple, and instinctive".&lt;ref&gt;John Ruskin, ''The Stones of Venice Vol 3'' p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex==

Sexual intercourse is sometimes seen as a true pleasure (or false one), contrasted with the less real pleasures of the past, as with [[John Donne|Donne]]'s "countrey pleasures, childishly".&lt;ref&gt;John Hayward, ''The Penguin Book of English Verse'' (1978) p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of [[Wilhelm Reich|Reich]], a distinction was sometimes made between reactive and genuine sexuality&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 515-6&lt;/ref&gt; - analysis supposedly allowing people to "realize the enormous difference between what they once believed sexual pleasure to be and what they now experience".&lt;ref&gt;''La P. D. A.'', quoted in Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (1997) p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mass media==

[[Popular culture]] has been a central arena for latter-day disputes over true and false pleasures. [[Modernism]] saw attacks on the false pleasures of consumerism from the right,&lt;ref&gt;D. Horowitz, ''Consuming Pleasures'' (2012) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; as well as from the left, with [[Herbert Marcuse]] denouncing the false pleasures of happy consciousness of "those whose life is the hell of the affluent society".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in John O' Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (1972) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

From another angle, [[Richard Hoggart]] contrasted the immediate, real pleasures of the working-class from the increasingly [[ersatz]] diet fed them by the media.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hoggart, ''The Uses of Literacy'' (1968) p. 132 and p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

As the 20th Century wore on, however - while concern for the contrast of false and authentic pleasures, fragmented or integrated experiences, certainly remained&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, p. 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; - the mass media increasingly became less of a scapegoat for the prevalence of false pleasure, figures like [[Frederic Jameson]] for example insisting instead on "the false problem of value" in a world where "reification or materialization is a key structural feature of both modernism and mass culture".&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks, ''The Jameson Reader'' (2005) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

==Žižek==

[[Slavoj Žižek]] had added a further twist to the debate for the 21st century, arguing that in a postmodern age dominated by what he calls "the superego injunction to enjoy that permeates our discourse", the quest for pleasure has become more of a duty than a pleasure: for Žižek, "[[psychoanalysis]] is the only discipline in which you are allowed ''not'' to enjoy" !&lt;ref&gt;Slavoj Žižek, ''The Parallax View'' (2006) p. 299 and 304&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Functional impulsivity'''  is a tendency to make quick decisions when it is optimal and beneficial. This [[impulsivity]] is in contrast with [[dysfunctional impulsivity]], which is a tendency to make quick decisions when it is not optimal. Although both types can be associated with inaccurate results, functional impulsivity is often considered a point of pride because it can help individuals take full advantage of opportunities.&lt;ref name="Dickman"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dickman, S. J.|year=1990|title=Functional and dysfunctional impulsivity: Personality and cognitive correlates|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=58|issue=1|pages=95–102|pmid=2308076|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.58.1.95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dickman Impulsivity Inventory ==

Functional impulsivity was first distinguished from dysfunctional impulsivity in a study performed by Scott J. Dickman in 1990. Although impulsivity has always been understood to have many different facets, Dickman showed two varieties that were significantly unrelated to one another. Before this research, impulsivity had commonly been considered a negative trait that could lead to problems in life. This research demonstrated that a specific type of impulsivity could be optimal and considered a positive trait.&lt;ref name="Dickman" /&gt;

The Dickman Impulsivity Inventory was developed to distinguish between trait functional and dysfunctional impulsivity. This inventory contains 63 items, 17 of which pertain specifically to functional impulsivity. This includes answer seeking propositions such as "I like to take part in really fast paced conversations, where you don't have much time to think before you speak" and "I am good at taking advantage of unexpected opportunities, where you have to do something immediately or lose your chance".&lt;ref name="Dickman" /&gt;

Before the Dickman Impulsivity Inventory, many of the measures of impulsivity related specifically to dysfunctional impulsivity. For instance, the only measure on the [[Eysenck Personality Questionnaire]] that was directly related to functional impulsivity measured venturesomeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cosi, S.|author2=Morales-Vives, F.|author3=Canals, J.|author4=Lorenzo-Seva, U.|author5=Vigil-Colet, A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2008|title=Functional and dysfunctional impulsivity in childhood and adolescence|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=103|issue=1|pages=67–76|pmid=18982938|doi=10.2466/pr0.103.1.67-76}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Dickman Impulsivity Inventory has been translated into many languages and a children's version has been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Brunas-Wagstaff, J.|author2=Tilley, A.|author3=Verity, M.|author4=Ford, S.|author5=Thompson, D.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1997|title=Functional and dysfunctional impulsivity in children and their relationship to Eysenck's impulsiveness and venturesomeness dimensions|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=22|issue=1|pages=19–35|doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(96)00173-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each scale has found a significant difference between functional and dysfunctional impulsivity.

Although high trait impulsivity has long been associated with substance abuse, several studies have found that relates only to dysfunctional impulsivity and not to functional impulsivity.

In image analysis, the '''generalized structure tensor (GST)''' is an extension of the Cartesian [[structure tensor]] to [[curvilinear coordinates]].&lt;ref name="bigun04pami3"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bigun |first1=J. |last2=Bigun |first2=T. |last3=Nilsson |first3=K. |title=Recognition by symmetry derivatives and the generalized structure tensor |journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence |date=December 2004 |volume=26 |issue=12 |pages=1590–1605 |doi=10.1109/TPAMI.2004.126}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is mainly used to detect and to represent the "direction" parameters of curves, just as the Cartesian structure tensor detects and represents the direction in Cartesian coordinates.  Curve families generated by pairs of locally orthogonal functions have been the best studied.

It is a widely known method in applications of image and video processing including computer vision, such as biometric identification by fingerprints,&lt;ref name=fronthaler08tip&gt;{{cite news|

==GST in 2D and locally orthogonal  bases==
Let the term image represent a function
&lt;math&gt;f(\xi(x,y),\eta(x,y))&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x,y &lt;/math&gt; are real variables and
&lt;math&gt;\xi,\eta &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, are real valued functions.
GST represents the direction along which the image &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; can undergo an infinitesimal translation with minimal (total least squares) error, along the "lines" fulfilling the following conditions:

1. The "lines" are ordinary lines in the curvilinear coordinate basis &lt;math&gt;\xi,\eta&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \cos(\theta) \xi(x,y)+\sin(\theta) \eta(x,y)= \text{constant} &lt;/math&gt;

which are curves in Cartesian coordinates as depicted by the equation  above. The error is measured in the &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt; sense and the  minimality of the error refers thereby to [[L2 norm]].

2. The functions &lt;math&gt;\xi(x,y), \eta(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; constitute a harmonic pair, i.e. they fulfill [[Cauchy–Riemann equations]],

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \frac{\partial \xi}{\partial x}=-\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y}, \\[4pt]
&amp; \frac{\partial \xi}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Accordingly, such curvilinear coordinates &lt;math&gt;\xi,\eta&lt;/math&gt; are locally orthogonal.

Then  GST consists in 
: &lt;math&gt; GST=(\lambda_{max}-\lambda_{min}) 
\int w(\xi,\eta)\left[ 
	\begin{array}{c}
	\frac{\partial f}{\partial \xi} \\
	\frac{\partial f}{\partial \eta} \\
	\end{array}
\right]
 [\frac{\partial f}{\partial \xi}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial \eta}] d\xi d\eta +\lambda_{min} I &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; 0\le \lambda_{min}\le \lambda_{max}&lt;/math&gt; are  errors of (infinitesimal) translation in the best direction (designated by the angle &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt;)  and the worst direction (designated by &lt;math&gt; \theta+\pi/2&lt;/math&gt;). The function &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; is the window function defining the "outer scale" wherein the detection of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; will be carried out, which can be omitted if it is already included in &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; or if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the full image (rather than local). The matrix &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt; is the identity matrix. Using the chain rule, it can be shown that the integration above can be implemented as convolutions in Cartesian coordinates applied to the ordinary structure tensor when &lt;math&gt;\xi,\eta&lt;/math&gt; pair the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function &lt;math&gt;g(z)&lt;/math&gt;, 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{c}
\xi(x,y)=\Re g(z)\\
\eta(x,y)=\Im g(z)\\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;z=x+iy&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bigun |first1=Josef |title=Pattern Recognition in Images by Symmetries and Coordinate Transformations |journal=Computer Vision and Image Understanding |date=December 1997 |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=290–307 |doi=10.1006/cviu.1997.0556}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Examples of analytic functions include  &lt;math&gt; g(z)=\log z=\log(x+iy)&lt;/math&gt;, as well as monomials  &lt;math&gt; g(z)=z^n=(x+iy)^n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; g(z)=z^{n/2}=(x+iy)^{n/2}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; n&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary positive or negative integer. The monomials &lt;math&gt; g(z)=z^n&lt;/math&gt; are also referred to as [[Harmonic functions]] in Computer Vision, and Image Processing.  

Thereby,  Cartesian [[Structure tensor]] is a special case of  GST where &lt;math&gt; \xi=x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \eta=y&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the harmonic function is simply &lt;math&gt; g(z)= z=(x+iy)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus by choosing a harmonic function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, one can detect all curves that are linear combinations of its real and imaginary parts by convolutions on (rectangular) image grids only, even if &lt;math&gt;\xi,\eta&lt;/math&gt; are non-Cartesian. Furthermore, the convolution computations can be done by using complex filters applied to the complex version of the structure tensor. Thus, GST implementations have frequently been done using complex version of the structure tensor,  rather than using the (1,1) tensor.

==Complex version of GST==
As there is a complex version of the ordinary [Structure tensor], there is also a complex version of the GST
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{c}
\kappa_{20} =(\lambda_1-\lambda_2)\exp(i2\theta)&amp;=&amp;w*(h*f)^2\\
\kappa_{11} =\lambda_1+\lambda_2&amp;=&amp;|w|*|h*f|^2\\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;    
which is  identical to its cousin with the difference that &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is a complex filter. It should be recalled that,  the ordinary [[structure tensor]] &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is a real filter, usually defined by a sampled and scaled Gaussian to delineate the neighborhood, also known as the outer scale. This simplicity is a reason for why GST implementations have predominantly used the complex version above.  For curve families &lt;math&gt;\xi,\eta&lt;/math&gt; defined by analytic functions &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, it can be shown that, &lt;ref name="bigun04pami3" /&gt; the neighborhood defining function is complex valued, 
:&lt;math&gt;w=(x \pm iy)^n\exp(-(x^2+y^2)/(2\sigma^2))\propto(D_x \pm iD_y)^n\exp(-(x^2+y^2)/(2\sigma^2))
&lt;/math&gt;, 
a so called symmetry derivative of a Gaussian. Thus, the orientation wise variation of the pattern to be looked for is directly incorporated into the neighborhood defining function, and the detection occurs in the space of the (ordinary) structure tensor.

==Basic concept for its use in image processing and computer vision ==

Efficient detection of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; in images is possible  by image processing for a pair &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;. Complex convolutions (or the corresponding matrix operations) and point-wise non-linear mappings are the basic computational elements of GST implementations.   A total least square error  estimation of &lt;math&gt;2\theta&lt;/math&gt; is then obtained along with the two errors, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{max}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{min}&lt;/math&gt;.  In analogy with the Cartesian [[Structure tensor]],   the  estimated  angle is in double angle representation, i.e. &lt;math&gt;2\theta&lt;/math&gt;  is delivered by computations,  and  can be used as a shape feature whereas &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{max}-\lambda_{min}&lt;/math&gt;  alone or in combination with 
&lt;math&gt;\lambda_{max}+\lambda_{min}&lt;/math&gt; can be used as a quality (confidence, certainty) measure for the angle estimation.

Logarithmic spirals, including circles,  can for instance be detected by (complex) convolutions and non-linear mappings.&lt;ref name=bigun04pami3 /&gt; The spirals  can be  in  gray (valued) images or in a binary image, i.e. locations of  edge elements of the concerned patterns, such as contours of circles or spirals,  must not be known or   marked otherwise.

Generalized structure tensor can be used as an alternative to [[Hough transform]] in [[image processing]] and [[computer vision]] to detect patterns whose local orientations can be modelled, for example junction points. The main differences comprise:
*Negative, as well as complex voting are allowed;
*With one template multiple patterns belonging to the same family can be detected;
*Image binarization is not required.

==Physical and mathemical interpretation==

The curvilinear coordinates of GST can explain physical processes applied to images. A well known pair of  processes  consist in rotation, and zooming. These are related to the coordinate transformation &lt;math&gt;\xi=\log(\sqrt{x^2+y^2})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta=\tan^{-1}(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;.

If an image &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; consists in iso-curves that can be explained by only $\xi$  i.e. its iso-curves consist in circles  &lt;math&gt;f(\xi,\eta)=g(\xi)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;g &lt;/math&gt; is any real valued differentiable function defined on 1D,  the image is invariant to rotations (around the origin).

Zooming (comprising unzooming) operation is modeled similarly.  If   the image has iso-curves that look like a "star"  or bicycle spokes, i.e. &lt;math&gt;f(\xi,\eta)=g(\eta)&lt;/math&gt; for some differentable 1D function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; then,  the image  &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is invariant to scaling (w.r.t. the origin).

In combination,

&lt;math&gt;f(\xi,\eta)=g( \cos(\theta) \log(\sqrt{x^2+y^2})+\sin(\theta) \tan^{-1}(x,y))&lt;/math&gt;

is invariant to a certain amount of rotation combined with scaling, where the amount is precised by the parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.

Analogously, the Cartesian [[structure tensor]] is  a representation of a translation too. Here the physical process consists in an ordinary translation of a certain amount along &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; combined with translation along &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt; \cos(\theta) x+\sin(\theta) y= \text{constant} &lt;/math&gt;

where the amount is specified by the parameter  &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. Evidently   &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; here represents the direction of the line.

Generally, the estimated &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; represents the  direction (in &lt;math&gt;\xi,\eta&lt;/math&gt; coordinates) along which infinitisemal translations leave the image invariant, in practice least variant.
With every curvilinear coordinate basis pair, there is thus a pair of  infinitesimal translators, a linear combination of  which is a  [[Differential operator]]. The latter are related to   [[Lie algebra]].

==Miscellaneous==
"Image" in the context of the GST can mean both an ordinary image and an image neighborhood thereof (local image), depending on context. For example, a photograph is an image as is any neighborhood of it.

'''Labia pride''' is a [[Feminist movements and ideologies|feminist movement]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; to raise awareness of the normal appearance of the [[vulva]] and to defy the trend towards cosmetic surgery on the female genitals ([[labiaplasty]], also known as "designer vagina").&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2013/02/17/the_labia_pride_movement/ ''The “labia pride” movement. Rebelling against the porn aesthetic, women are taking to the Internet to sing the praises of "endowed" women''] - Salon&lt;/ref&gt; It is supported by several independent feminist groups and based on diverse channels of communication such as [[cyberfeminism]], [[protest march]]es and advocating boycotts against physicians and clinics that make use of [[deceptive advertising]].

==Forms of activism==

=== Muff March ===

The [[London]]-based feminist group [[UK Feminista]] organized a [[Demonstration (protest)|protest march]] through [[Harley Street]], an area synonymous with its private medical providers, in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hackneygazette.co.uk/news/hackney_feminist_leads_muff_march_protest_1_1152988 ''Hackney Feminist leads ‘Muff March’ protest''] - Hackney Gazette&lt;/ref&gt; More than 320 women paraded the street, with slogans like: "Keep your mits off our bits!", "There's nothing finer than my vagina!", and "Harley Street puts my chuff in a huff"&lt;ref name="ukfeminista"&gt;[http://ukfeminista.org.uk/2011/12/rise-in-‘designer-vaginas’-sparks-muff-march-protests/ ''Rise in ‘designer vaginas’ sparks Muff March protests''] - Press release: UK Feminista&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Muff March Harley Street 5.jpg|thumb|''"Love your labia!"'' - Woman displaying sign at the Muff March in London, 2011]]

{{quote|Muff March is about speaking back to a pornified culture which is pressuring women to go under the surgeon's knife and get a 'designer vagina'. We also want to shine a spotlight on the cosmetic surgeons who ruthlessly mine women's bodies to extract maximum profit.[...] Now pornography is exposing women to the toxic myth that there is one 'right' way for their labia to look. It's time to fight back.|[[Kat Banyard]], Director of UK Feminista&lt;ref name="ukfeminista"/&gt;}}

The "Muff March" has been criticized for putting too much emphasis on pornography as a root cause of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/11/muff-march-porn-designer-vaginas ''Is the Muff March such a cunning stunt?''] - The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Feminist views on pornography]].)

===Photo campaigns===

The growing demand for labiaplasty surgery is sometimes attributed to the idea that many women, as well as men, have unrealistic expectations regarding genital appearance. Almost all explicit depictions of female genitalia that people are confronted with are produced by the [[adult industry|sex industry]]. [[Pornography]] is usually produced in a commercial context and primarily addresses male customers. Therefore, these depictions of female genitalia are often "beautified" to suit commercial need (or in some countries for legal reasons),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/hungrybeast/blog/kdrysdale/healing-it-single-crease/ |title=Healing It To A Single Crease |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606203538/http://www.abc.net.au/tv/hungrybeast/blog/kdrysdale/healing-it-single-crease |archivedate=2012-06-06 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}} [http://vimeo.com/9924049 Video-Podcast on Vimeo]&lt;/ref&gt; either by the selection of models with a certain anatomy or by [[photoshopping]] the images. In practice, this means smoothing out irregularities and "digitally shortening" the [[labia minora]].

{{quote|A whole generation of young women who have grown up with ready access to the Internet are learning about their bodies and sexuality through this medium...Often the first and only way girls get to have a good look at other girls' naked genitals is through pornography, [which gives] a false view of what real women look like.|Madeleine Davies&lt;ref&gt;[http://jezebel.com/5985002/this-aint-no-porn-star-vagina-large-labias-need-love-too ''This Ain’t No Porn Star Vagina: Large Labias Need Love Too''] - Jezebel&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Jodie's liberated vulva.jpg|thumb|upright|Women post photographs of their vulvas "to publicly catalog normal genital diversity" and "counter unrealistic standards"&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt;]]
Several feminist groups, such as the ''Large Labia Project'' or ''Courageous Cunts'' try to oppose the influence that pornography has on anatomic expectations. By encouraging women to release images of their vulvas and post photo submissions of anonymous vulvas on their websites, they want to establish a sphere for women to get realistic impressions of normal vulvas.

However, the campaign itself has been criticized. By giving the false impression that protruding labia are the anatomical norm and small inner labia are the adaptation to beauty standards, it ignores the fact that many women have naturally small labia:

{{quote|In an effort to make "real women" feel better about themselves, some labia proud ladies are taking shots at girls whose labia actually look like the imaginary "Barbie" ideal. Turns out, some girls are actually born like that. Labia, like boobs or entire bodies, come in all shapes, sizes, colors and textures. Shaming one to make another type feel better is bad news. Think of it in terms of thin women who are often shamed or shunned in support of body image advocacy for larger girls.|Jessica Sager&lt;ref name="fewprob"&gt;[http://www.gurl.com/2013/02/19/your-labia/ ''The Labia Pride Movement Has A Few Problems''] - Gurl Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Furthermore, these campaigns as well have been criticized for putting too much blame on the porn industry and the subjection to male desires. It is argued that even though this might be the case to a certain degree, other factors that boost these surgeries are basically ignored.&lt;ref name="fewprob"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/02/20/the_large_labia_project_a_misguided_campaign_to_fight_porn_and_promote_real.html ''Insecure About Your Vagina? Sharing a Photo on the Internet Won't Fix That.''] - Slate&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that smaller labia are actually preferred, as much or more "large labia" porn exists than any labeled for small.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== New View campaign ===
New View is a [[New York City]] based, grassroots network of feminists, social scientists and health care providers. In a self-description, New View "is opposed to the growth of the unregulated and unmonitored genital cosmetic surgery industry that is medicalizing women's sexuality and creating new risks, norms and insecurities."&lt;ref&gt;[http://newviewcampaign.org/fgcs.asp ''Female Genital Cosmetic Surgery (FGCS) Activism''] - New View&lt;/ref&gt; The group initiated several events with the aim of empowering women and raising awareness for the topic under names such as the ''Vulvagraphics'' or ''Vulvanomics''. These include workshops to "celebrate the role of art in activism and to kick off a campus-based movement to celebrate genital diversity",&lt;ref&gt;[http://newviewcampaign.org/vulvagraphics.asp ''Challenging the Medicalization of Sex''] - New View Campaign&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csgsnyu.org/2009/09/vulvagraphics-an-intervention-in-honor-of-female-genital-diversity/ ''VULVAGRAPHICS: An intervention in honor of female genital diversity!''] - Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality, [[New York University]]&lt;/ref&gt; "flash activism" in front of surgeon's offices,&lt;ref&gt;[http://newviewcampaign.org/media/pdfs/Flash%20Activism.pdf ''Flash activism''] - New View Campaign&lt;/ref&gt; conferences (''Framing the Vulva'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://sexuality.about.com/b/2010/09/02/a-different-kind-of-vulva-story-las-vegas-new-view-conference.htm ''A Different Kind of Vulva Story: Las Vegas New View Conference''] - About&lt;/ref&gt; and street demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1859937,00.html ''Plastic Surgery Below the Belt''] - Time Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Courageous Cunts ===
[[File:Courageouscunts logo.jpg|thumb|upright|Logo]]
Courageous Cunts is a feminist website,&lt;ref&gt;www.courageouscunts.com [https://web.archive.org/web/20131227194904/courageouscunts.com/ archived version of Courageous Cunts website from Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 2012, that is focused on issues of body empowerment and genital self-awareness. Its primary concern is the critical reception of [[women's health]] issues, sexualized [[body image]]s and the [[sexual objectification]] of female bodies. Courageous Cunts considers itself to be part of the so-called labia pride movement, with the aim of raising awareness for critical issues around [[labiaplasty]] and empowering women to overcome body shame. The site ran a campaign during which women could publicly post photographs of their [[vulva]] to promote a natural genital image and protest against "porn aesthetics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Lemuria''' {{IPAc-en|l|ᵻ|ˈ|m|juː|r|i|ə}}&lt;ref&gt;OED&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Limuria''' is a hypothetical "[[Lost lands|lost land]]" located either in the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] or the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Ocean, as postulated by a now-discredited [[19th century in science|19th-century]] [[scientific theory]]. The idea was then adopted by the [[occultists]] of the time and consequently has been [[Lemuria in popular culture|incorporated into pop culture]].

==Evolution of the idea==
Originally, Lemuria was hypothesized as a [[land bridge]], now sunken, which would account for certain discontinuities in [[biogeography]]. This idea has been rendered obsolete by modern theories of [[plate tectonics]]. Sunken continents such as [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]] in the Pacific, [[Mauritia (microcontinent)|Mauritia]]&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|last=Morelle |first=Rebecca |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21551149 |title=BBC News - Fragments of ancient continent buried under Indian Ocean |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date=2013-02-25 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Kerguelen Plateau]] in the Indian Ocean do exist, but no geological formation under the Indian or Pacific Oceans is known that could have served as a land bridge between continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/navigation/?type=static&amp;page=archiveSearch&amp;aid=20110422280809000&amp;ais=08&amp;avol=28 |title=Navigation News |publisher=Frontline.in |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of Lemuria was subsequently incorporated into the proto-[[New Age]] philosophy of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and subsequently into general fringe belief. Accounts of Lemuria here differ. All share a common belief that a [[continent]] existed in ancient times and sank beneath the ocean as a result of a geological, often [[wikt:cataclysmic|cataclysmic]], change, such as [[pole shift]], which such theorists anticipate will destroy and transform the modern world.

==Scientific origins==
===Postulation===
In 1864, "The Mammals of Madagascar" by [[zoologist]] and biogeographer [[Philip Sclater]] appeared in ''[[The Quarterly Journal of Science]]''. Using a classification he referred to as [[lemur]]s, but which included related primate groups,&lt;ref name="Neild, Ted 2007 pp. 38–39"&gt;Neild, Ted ''Supercontinent: Ten Billion Years in the Life of Our Planet'' pp.Harvard University Press (2 Nov 2007) {{ISBN|978-0-674-02659-9}} pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; and puzzled by the presence of their [[fossil]]s in both [[Madagascar]] and [[India]], but not in [[Africa]] or the [[Middle East]], Sclater proposed that Madagascar and India had once been part of a larger continent (he was correct in this; though in reality this was the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]]).

&lt;blockquote&gt;The anomalies of the mammal fauna of Madagascar can best be explained by supposing that ... a large continent occupied parts of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans ... that this continent was broken up into islands, of which some have become amalgamated with ... Africa, some ... with what is now Asia; and that in Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands we have existing relics of this great continent, for which ... I should propose the name Lemuria!&lt;ref name="Neild, Ted 2007 pp. 38–39"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Parallels===
Sclater's [[theory]] was hardly unusual for his time; "[[land bridge]]s", real and imagined, fascinated several of Sclater's contemporaries. [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], also looking at the relationship between animals in India and Madagascar, had suggested a southern continent about two decades before Sclater, but did not give it a name.&lt;ref&gt;
Neild, Ted ''Supercontinent: Ten Billion Years in the Life of Our Planet'' pp.Harvard University Press (2 Nov 2007) {{ISBN|978-0-674-02659-9}} p.38&lt;/ref&gt; The acceptance of [[Darwinism]] led scientists to seek to trace the diffusion of species from their points of [[evolution]]ary origin. Prior to the acceptance of [[continental drift]], [[biology|biologists]] frequently postulated submerged land masses to account for populations of land-based species now separated by barriers of water. Similarly, [[geology|geologists]] tried to account for striking resemblances of rock formations on different continents. The first systematic attempt was made by [[Melchior Neumayr]] in his book ''Erdgeschichte'' in 1887. Many [[hypothetical]] submerged [[land bridge]]s and [[continents]] were proposed during the 19th century to account for the present distribution of [[species]].

===Promulgation===
After gaining some acceptance within the scientific community, the concept of Lemuria began to appear in the works of other scholars. [[Ernst Haeckel]], a Darwinian [[taxonomist]], proposed Lemuria as an explanation for the absence of "[[Transitional fossil#Missing links|missing link]]" fossil records. According to another source, Haeckel put forward this thesis prior to Sclater (but without using the name "Lemuria").&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp]], [[Lost Continents]], 1954 (First Edition), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Locating the origins of the human species on this lost continent, he claimed the fossil record could not be found because it sank beneath the sea.

Other scientists hypothesized that Lemuria had extended across parts of the Pacific Ocean, seeking to explain the distribution of various species across [[Asia]] and the [[Americas]].

===Supersession===
The Lemuria theory disappeared completely from conventional scientific consideration after the theories of plate tectonics and continental drift were accepted by the larger scientific community. According to the theory of plate tectonics, Madagascar and India were indeed once part of the same landmass (thus accounting for geological resemblances), but plate movement caused India to break away millions of years ago, and move to its present location. The original landmass, the supercontinent [[Gondwana]], broke apart; it did not sink beneath sea level.

==Kumari Kandam==
[[File:Kumari Kandam map.png|thumb|250px|"Lemuria" in [[Tamil nationalist]] mysticist literature, connecting [[Madagascar]], [[South India]], and Australia (covering most of the Indian Ocean)]]
Some Tamil writers such as [[Devaneya Pavanar]] have associated Lemuria with [[Kumari Kandam]], a legendary sunken landmass mentioned in the Tamil literature, claiming that it was the [[cradle of civilization]].

==In popular culture==
{{main|Lemuria in popular culture}}
Since the 1880s, the hypothesis of Lemuria has inspired many novels, television shows, films, and music.

'''''Linguistic Imperialism''''' is a book written by [[Robert Phillipson]], research professor at [[Copenhagen Business School]]'s Department of English, published in 1992 by [[Oxford University Press]].

In ''Linguistic Imperialism'', Phillipson argues that [[Western world|Western countries]] have used [[English language|English]] as a tool of [[imperialism]] to dominate [[Colonialism|colonies and former colonies]].  He further explores the ideologies transmitted through the English language.

The book was followed by ''Linguistic Imperialism Continued'', first published by [[Routledge]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Waters |first=Alan |title=Linguistic Imperialism Continued |url=http://eltj.oxfordjournals.org/content/67/1/126.extract |journal=ELT

'''Logic''' (from the {{lang-grc|[[wikt:λογική|λογική]]|logikḗ}}&lt;ref name="argumentative"/&gt;), originally meaning "the word" or "what is spoken", but coming to mean "thought" or "reason", is a subject concerned with the most general laws of [[truth]],&lt;ref&gt;Due to Frege, see the [[Definitions of logic]] article.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now generally held to consist of the systematic study of the [[Logical form|form]] of [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[inference]]. A valid inference is one where there is a specific relation of logical support between the assumptions of the inference and its [[consequent|conclusion]]. (In ordinary discourse, inferences may be signified by words such as ''therefore'', ''hence'', ''ergo'', and so on.)

There is no universal agreement as to the exact scope and subject matter of logic (see {{section link||Rival conceptions}}, below), but it has traditionally included the classification of arguments, the systematic exposition of the 'logical form' common to all valid arguments, the study of [[inference]], including [[fallacies]], and the study of [[semantics]], including [[paradox]]es.  Historically, logic has been studied in [[philosophy]] (since ancient times) and [[mathematics]] (since the mid-19th century), and recently logic has been studied in [[computer science]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], and other fields.

==Concepts==
{{rquote|right|Upon this first, and in one sense this sole, rule of reason, that in order to learn you must desire to learn, and in so desiring not be satisfied with what you already incline to capably think, there follows one corollary which itself deserves to be inscribed upon every wall of the city of philosophy: Do not block the way of inquiry.|[[Charles Sanders Peirce]], "First Rule of Logic"}}
The concept of [[logical form]] is central to logic. The validity of an argument is determined by its logical form, not by its content. Traditional [[syllogism|Aristotelian syllogistic logic]] and modern symbolic logic are examples of formal logic.
* '''[[Informal logic]]''' is the study of [[natural language]] [[Logical argument|arguments]]. The study of [[fallacies]] is an important branch of informal logic. Since much informal argument is not strictly speaking deductive, on some conceptions of logic, informal logic is not logic at all.  See 'Rival conceptions', below.
* '''[[Mathematical formalism|Formal logic]]''' is the study of [[inference]] with purely formal content. An inference possesses a ''purely formal content'' if it can be expressed as a particular application of a wholly abstract rule, that is, a rule that is not about any particular thing or property. The works of [[Aristotle]] contain the earliest known formal study of logic. Modern formal logic follows and expands on Aristotle.&lt;ref name="The Basic Works"/&gt; In many definitions of logic, [[logical consequence|logical inference]] and inference with purely formal content are the same. This does not render the notion of informal logic vacuous, because no formal logic captures all of the nuances of natural language.
* '''[[Mathematical logic#Symbolic logic|Symbolic logic]]''' is the study of symbolic abstractions that capture the formal features of logical inference.&lt;ref name="Principia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt; Symbolic logic is often divided into two main branches: [[propositional logic]] and [[predicate logic]].
* '''[[Mathematical logic]]''' is an extension of symbolic logic into other areas, in particular to the study of [[model theory]], [[proof theory]], [[set theory]], and [[recursion theory]].

However, agreement on what logic is has remained elusive, and although the field of [[universal logic]] has studied the common structure of logics, in 2007 Mossakowski et al. commented that "it is embarrassing that there is no widely acceptable formal definition of 'a logic'".&lt;ref&gt;T. Mossakowski, [[Joseph Goguen|J. A. Goguen]], R. Diaconescu, A. Tarlecki, "What is a Logic?", [[Logica Universalis]] 2007 Birkhauser,  pp. 113–133.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logical form===
{{main article|Logical form}}
Logic is generally considered '''formal''' when it analyzes and represents the ''form'' of any valid argument type. The form of an argument is displayed by representing its sentences in the formal grammar and symbolism of a logical language to make its content usable in formal inference. Simply put, to formalize simply means to translate English sentences into the language of logic.

This is called showing the ''logical form'' of the argument. It is necessary because indicative sentences of ordinary language show a considerable variety of form and complexity that makes their use in inference impractical. It requires, first, ignoring those grammatical features irrelevant to logic (such as gender and declension, if the argument is in Latin), replacing conjunctions irrelevant to logic (such as "but") with logical conjunctions like "and" and replacing ambiguous, or alternative logical expressions ("any", "every", etc.) with expressions of a standard type (such as "all", or the [[universal quantifier]] ∀).

Second, certain parts of the sentence must be replaced with schematic letters. Thus, for example, the expression "all Ps are Qs" shows the logical form common to the sentences "all men are mortals", "all cats are carnivores", "all Greeks are philosophers", and so on.  The schema can further be condensed into the [[formula]] ''A(P,Q)'', where the letter ''A'' indicates the judgement 'all - are -'.

The importance of form was recognised from ancient times. Aristotle uses variable letters to represent valid inferences in ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', leading [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] to say that the introduction of variables was "one of Aristotle's greatest inventions".&lt;ref name="Aristotle's syllogistic from the standpoint of modern formal logic"/&gt; According to the followers of Aristotle (such as [[Ammonius Saccas|Ammonius]]), only the logical principles stated in schematic terms belong to logic, not those given in concrete terms. The concrete terms "man", "mortal", etc., are analogous to the substitution values of the schematic placeholders ''P'', ''Q'', ''R'', which were called the "matter" (Greek ''hyle'') of the inference.

There is a big difference between the kinds of formulas seen in traditional term logic and the [[predicate calculus]] that is the fundamental advance of modern logic.  The formula ''A(P,Q)'' (all Ps are Qs) of traditional logic corresponds to the more complex formula &lt;math&gt;\forall x. (P(x) \rightarrow Q(x))&lt;/math&gt; in predicate logic, involving the logical connectives for [[universal quantification]] and [[material conditional|implication]] rather than just the predicate letter ''A'' and using variable arguments &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; where traditional logic uses just the term letter ''P''.  With the complexity comes power, and the advent of the predicate calculus inaugurated revolutionary growth of the subject.

=== Semantics ===
{{main article|Semantics of logic}}

The validity of an argument depends upon the meaning or ''semantics'' of the sentences that make it up.

Aristotle's [[Organon]], especially ''[[On Interpretation]]'', gives a cursory outline of semantics which the [[scholastic logic]]ians, particularly in the thirteenth and fourteenth century, developed into a complex and sophisticated theory, called [[Supposition Theory]].  This showed how the truth of simple sentences, expressed schematically, depend on how the terms 'supposit' or ''stand for'' certain extra-linguistic items.  For example, in part II of his [[Sum of Logic|Summa Logicae]], [[William of Ockham]] presents a comprehensive account of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of simple sentences, in order to show which arguments are valid and which are not.  Thus "every A is B' is true if and only if there is something for which 'A' stands, and there is nothing for which 'A' stands, for which 'B' does not also stand." &lt;ref&gt;''Summa Logicae'' Part II c.4 transl. as ''Ockam's Theory of Propositions'', A. Freddoso and H. Schuurman, St Augustine's Press 1998, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Early modern logic defined semantics purely as a relation between ideas.  [[Antoine Arnauld]] in the [[Port Royal Logic]], says that 'after conceiving things by our ideas, we compare these ideas, and, finding that some belong together and some do not, we unite or separate them. This is called ''affirming'' or ''denying'', and in general ''judging''.&lt;ref&gt;Arnauld, ''Logic or the Art of Thinking'' Part 2 Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus truth and falsity are no more than the agreement or disagreement of ideas.  This suggests obvious difficulties, leading [[John Locke|Locke]] to distinguish between 'real' truth, when our ideas have 'real existence' and 'imaginary' or 'verbal' truth, where ideas like harpies or centaurs exist only in the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, 1690.  [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]], IV. v. 1-8)&lt;/ref&gt;  This view ([[psychologism]]) was taken to the extreme in the nineteenth century, and is generally held by modern logicians to signify a low point in the decline of logic before the twentieth century.

Modern semantics is in some ways closer to the medieval view, in rejecting such psychological truth-conditions.  However, the introduction of [[quantifier (logic)|quantification]], needed to solve the [[problem of multiple generality]], rendered impossible the kind of subject-predicate analysis that underlies medieval semantics.  The main modern approach is ''model-theoretic semantics'', based on [[Alfred Tarski]]'s [[semantic theory of truth]].  The approach assumes that the meaning of the various parts of the propositions are given by the possible ways we can give a recursively specified group of [[interpretation function]]s from them to some predefined [[domain of discourse]]: an interpretation of [[first-order predicate logic]] is given by a mapping from terms to a universe of [[individual]]s, and a mapping from propositions to the truth values "true" and "false".  Model-theoretic semantics is one of the fundamental concepts of [[model theory]].  Modern semantics also admits rival approaches, such as the [[proof-theoretic semantics]] that associates the meaning of propositions with the roles that they can play in inferences, an approach that ultimately derives from the work of [[Gerhard Gentzen]] on [[structural proof theory]] and is heavily influenced by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later philosophy, especially his aphorism "meaning is use".

===Inference===
''Inference'' is not to be confused with ''implication''.  An implication is a sentence of the form 'If p then q', and can be true or false.  [[Stoic logic|The Stoic logician]] [[Philo the Dialectician|Philo of Megara]] was the first to define the truth conditions of such an implication: false only when the antecedent p is true and the consequent q is false, in all other cases true.  An inference, on the other hand, consists of two separately asserted propositions of the form 'p therefore q'.  An inference is not true or false, but valid or invalid.  However, there is a connection between implication and inference, as follows: if the implication 'if p then q' is ''true'', the inference 'p therefore q' is ''valid''.  This was given an apparently paradoxical formulation by Philo, who said that the implication 'if it is day, it is night' is true only at night, so the inference 'it is day, therefore it is night' is valid in the night, but not in the day.

The theory of inference (or 'consequences') was systematically developed in medieval times by logicians such as [[William of Ockham]] and [[Walter Burley]].  It is uniquely medieval, though it has its origins in Aristotle's [[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]] and [[Boethius]]' ''De Syllogismis hypotheticis''.  This is why many terms in logic are Latin.  For example, the rule that licenses the move from the implication 'if p then q' plus the assertion of its antecedent p, to the assertion of the consequent q is known as [[modus ponens]] (or 'mode of positing').  Its Latin formulation is 'Posito antecedente ponitur consequens'.  The Latin formulations of many other rules such as 'ex falso quodlibet' (anything follows from a falsehood), 'reductio ad absurdum' (disproof by showing the consequence is absurd) also date from this period.

However, the theory of consequences, or of the so-called '[[hypothetical syllogism]]' was never fully integrated into the theory of the 'categorical syllogism'.  This was partly because of the resistance to reducing the categorical judgment 'Every S is P' to the so-called hypothetical judgment 'if anything is S, it is P'.  The first was thought to imply 'some S is P', the second was not, and as late as 1911 in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] article on Logic, we find the Oxford logician T.H. Case arguing against Sigwart's and Brentano's modern analysis of the universal proposition.

===Logical systems===
{{main article|Formal system}}
A formal system is an organization of terms used for the analysis of deduction. It consists of an alphabet, a language over the alphabet to construct sentences, and a rule for deriving sentences. Among the important properties that [[logical system]]s can have are:
* '''[[Consistency proof|Consistency]]''', which means that no theorem of the system contradicts another.&lt;ref name="Bergmann, Merrie 2009"/&gt;
* '''[[Validity (logic)|Validity]]''', which means that the system's rules of proof never allow a false inference from true premises.
* '''[[completeness (logic)|Completeness]]''', which means that if a formula is true, it can be proven, i.e. is a ''theorem'' of the system.
* '''[[Soundness]]''', meaning that if any formula is a theorem of the system, it is true. This is the converse of completeness. (Note that in a distinct philosophical use of the term, an argument is sound  when it is both valid and its premises are true).&lt;ref&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://www.iep.utm.edu/val-snd/ Validity and Soundness]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some logical systems do not have all four properties. As an example, [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]] show that sufficiently complex formal systems of arithmetic cannot be consistent and complete;&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt; however, first-order predicate logics not extended by specific [[axiom]]s to be arithmetic formal systems with equality can be complete and consistent.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Mathematical Logic"/&gt;

===Logic and rationality===
{{main article|Logic and rationality}}
{{confusing|section|date=May 2016}}
As the study of argument is of clear importance to the reasons that we hold things to be true, logic is of essential importance to [[rationality]].  Here we have defined logic to be "the systematic study of the form of arguments"; the reasoning behind argument is of several sorts, but only some of these arguments fall under the aegis of logic proper.

[[Deductive reasoning]] concerns the [[logical consequence]] of given premises and is the form of reasoning most closely connected to logic. On a narrow conception of logic (see below) logic concerns just deductive reasoning, although such a narrow conception controversially excludes most of what is called informal logic from the discipline.

There are other forms of reasoning that are rational but that are generally not taken to be part of logic.  These include [[inductive reasoning]], which covers forms of inference that move from collections of particular judgements to universal judgements, and [[abductive reasoning]],&lt;ref name=abduction&gt;On [[abductive reasoning]], see:
* Magnani, L. ''Abduction, Reason, and Science: Processes of Discovery and Explanation''. Kluwer Academic Plenum Publishers, New York, 2001. xvii. 205 pages. Hardcover, {{isbn|0-306-46514-0}}.

Hardcover, {{isbn|90-272-4983-0}}, {{ISBN|1556197942}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a form of inference that goes from observation to a hypothesis that accounts for the reliable data (observation) and seeks to explain relevant evidence. The American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) first introduced the term as "guessing".&lt;ref name=guess&gt;See [http://www.commens.org/dictionary/term/abduction Abduction] and [http://www.commens.org/dictionary/term/retroduction Retroduction] at ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'', and see Peirce's papers:
* "On the Logic of drawing History from Ancient Documents especially from Testimonies" (1901), ''Collected Papers'' v. 7, paragraph 219.
* "PAP" ["Prolegomena to an Apology for Pragmatism"], MS 293 c. 1906, ''New Elements of Mathematics'' v. 4, pp. 319–320.
* A Letter to F. A. Woods (1913), ''Collected Papers'' v. 8, paragraphs 385–388.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce said that to ''abduce'' a hypothetical explanation &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; from an observed surprising circumstance &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is to surmise that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; may be true because then &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; would be a matter of course.&lt;ref name=HL&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1903), Harvard lectures on pragmatism, ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, [http://www.textlog.de/7664-2.html paragraphs 188–189].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, to abduce &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; involves determining that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is [[necessary and sufficient conditions|sufficient (or nearly sufficient), but not necessary]], for &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.

While inductive and abductive inference are not part of logic proper, the methodology of logic has been applied to them with some degree of success.  For example, the notion of deductive validity (where an inference is deductively valid [[if and only if]] there is no possible situation in which all the premises are true but the conclusion false) exists in an analogy to the notion of inductive validity, or "strength", where an inference is inductively strong if and only if its premises give some degree of probability to its conclusion.  Whereas the notion of deductive validity can be rigorously stated for systems of formal logic in terms of the well-understood notions of [[semantics]], inductive validity requires us to define a reliable generalization of some set of observations. The task of providing this definition may be approached in various ways, some less formal than others; some of these definitions may use logical association [[rule induction]], while others may use [[mathematical model]]s of probability such as [[decision tree]]s.

===Rival conceptions===
{{Main article|Rival conceptions of logic}}
Logic arose (see below) from a concern with correctness of [[argumentation]]. Modern logicians usually wish to ensure that logic studies just those arguments that arise from appropriately general forms of inference. For example, Thomas Hofweber writes in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' that logic "does not, however, cover good reasoning as a whole. That is the job of the theory of [[rationality]]. Rather it deals with inferences whose validity can be traced back to the formal features of the representations that are involved in that inference, be they linguistic, mental, or other representations."&lt;ref name="stanford-logic-onthology"/&gt;

Logic has been defined{{by whom|date=September 2016}} as "the study of arguments correct in virtue of their form".  This has not been the definition taken in this article, but the idea that logic treats special forms of argument, deductive argument, rather than argument in general, has a history in logic that dates back at least to [[logicism]] in mathematics (19th and 20th centuries) and the advent of the influence of mathematical logic on philosophy.  A consequence of taking logic to treat special kinds of argument is that it leads to identification of special kinds of truth, the logical truths (with logic equivalently being the study of logical truth), and excludes many of the original objects of study of logic that are treated as informal logic.  [[Robert Brandom]] has argued against the idea that logic is the study of a special kind of logical truth, arguing that instead one can talk of the logic of [[material inference]] (in the terminology of [[Wilfred Sellars]]), with logic making explicit the commitments that were originally implicit in informal inference.&lt;ref name="brandom-2000" /&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}}

==History==
{{Main article|History of logic}}
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Aristotle]], 384–322&amp;nbsp;BCE.]]
In Europe, logic was first developed by [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="achievement"/&gt; [[Aristotelian logic]] became widely accepted in science and mathematics and remained in wide use in the West until the early 19th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="mtu"/&gt; Aristotle's system of logic was responsible for the introduction of [[hypothetical syllogism]],&lt;ref name="google"/&gt; [[Temporal logic|temporal]] [[modal logic]],&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; and [[Inductive reasoning|inductive logic]],&lt;ref name="google3"/&gt; as well as influential terms such as [[terminology|terms]], [[predicables]], [[syllogisms]] and [[proposition]]s. In [[Europe]] during the later medieval period, major efforts were made to show that Aristotle's ideas were compatible with [[Christian]] faith. During the [[High Middle Ages]], logic became a main focus of philosophers, who would engage in critical logical analyses of philosophical arguments, often using variations of the methodology of [[scholasticism]]. In 1323, [[William of Ockham]]'s influential ''[[Sum of Logic|Summa Logicae]]'' was released. By the 18th century, the structured approach to arguments had degenerated and fallen out of favour, as depicted in [[Ludvig Holberg|Holberg]]'s satirical play ''[[Erasmus Montanus]]''.

The [[Logic in China|Chinese logical]] philosopher [[Gongsun Long]] ({{nowrap|c. 325–250 BCE}}) proposed the paradox "One and one cannot become two, since neither becomes two."&lt;ref name="propositions"/&gt; In China, the tradition of scholarly investigation into logic, however, was repressed by the [[Qin dynasty]] following the legalist philosophy of [[Han Feizi]].

In India, the [[Anviksiki]] school of logic was founded by [[Indian logic|Medhatithi Gautama]] (c. 6th century BCE).&lt;ref&gt;S. C. Vidyabhusana (1971). ''A History of Indian Logic: Ancient, Mediaeval, and Modern Schools'', pp. 17–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Innovations in the scholastic school, called [[Nyaya]], continued from ancient times into the early 18th&amp;nbsp;century with the [[Navya-Nyaya]] school. By the 16th&amp;nbsp;century, it developed theories resembling modern logic, such as [[Gottlob Frege]]'s "distinction between sense and reference of proper names" and his "definition of number", as well as the theory of "restrictive conditions for universals" anticipating some of the developments in modern [[set theory]].&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti"/&gt; Since 1824, Indian logic attracted the attention of many Western scholars, and has had an influence on important 19th-century logicians such as [[Charles Babbage]], [[Augustus De Morgan]], and [[George Boole]].&lt;ref name="Indian logic: a reader"/&gt; In the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, Western philosophers like Stanislaw Schayer and Klaus Glashoff have explored Indian logic more extensively.

The [[Syllogism|syllogistic]] logic developed by Aristotle predominated in the West until the mid-19th&amp;nbsp;century, when interest in the [[foundations of mathematics]] stimulated the development of symbolic logic (now called [[mathematical logic]]). In 1854, George Boole published ''[[The Laws of Thought|An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities]]'', introducing symbolic logic and the principles of what is now known as [[Boolean logic]]. In 1879, Gottlob Frege published ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'', which inaugurated modern logic with the invention of [[Quantification (logic)|quantifier]] notation. From 1910 to 1913, [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] published ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''&lt;ref name="Principia"/&gt; on the foundations of mathematics, attempting to derive mathematical truths from [[axiom]]s and [[inference rule]]s in symbolic logic. In 1931, [[Gödel]] raised serious problems with the foundationalist program and logic ceased to focus on such issues.

The development of logic since Frege, Russell, and [[Wittgenstein]] had a profound influence on the practice of philosophy and the perceived nature of philosophical problems (see [[analytic philosophy]]) and [[philosophy of mathematics]]. Logic, especially sentential logic, is implemented in computer [[Digital electronics|logic circuits]] and is fundamental to [[computer science]]. Logic is commonly taught by university philosophy departments, often as a compulsory discipline.

===Syllogistic logic===
{{main article|Aristotelian logic}}
[[File:Johannesmagistris-square.jpg|thumb|A depiction from the 15th century of the [[square of opposition]], which expresses the fundamental dualities of syllogistic.]]

The ''[[Organon]]'' was [[Aristotle]]'s body of work on logic, with the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'' constituting the first explicit work in formal logic, introducing the syllogistic.&lt;ref name="Aristotle"/&gt; The parts of syllogistic logic, also known by the name [[term logic]], are the analysis of the judgements into propositions consisting of two terms that are related by one of a fixed number of relations, and the expression of inferences by means of [[syllogism]]s that consist of two propositions sharing a common term as premise, and a conclusion that is a proposition involving the two unrelated terms from the premises.

Aristotle's work was regarded in classical times and from medieval times in Europe and the Middle East as the very picture of a fully worked out system. However, it was not alone: the [[Stoics]] proposed a system of [[propositional logic]] that was studied by medieval logicians. Also, the [[problem of multiple generality]] was recognized in medieval times. Nonetheless, problems with syllogistic logic were not seen as being in need of revolutionary solutions.

Today, some academics claim that Aristotle's system is generally seen as having little more than historical value (though there is some current interest in extending term logics), regarded as made obsolete by the advent of propositional logic and the [[predicate calculus]]. Others use Aristotle in [[argumentation theory]] to help develop and critically question argumentation schemes that are used in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[legal]] arguments.

{{Quotation|I was upset. I had always believed logic was a universal weapon, and now I realized how its validity depended on the way it was employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Name of the Rose|last=Eco|first=Umberto|publisher=Vintage|year=1980|isbn=9780099466031|location=London|pages=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Propositional logic===
{{main article|Propositional calculus}}
A propositional calculus or logic (also a sentential calculus) is a formal system in which formulae representing propositions can be formed by combining [[atomic propositions]] using [[logical connectives]], and in which a system of formal proof rules establishes certain formulae as "theorems".  An example of a theorem of propositional logic is &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;, which says that if A holds, then B implies A.

===Predicate logic===
[[File:BS-12-Begriffsschrift Quantifier1-svg.svg|thumb|[[Gottlob Frege]]'s ''[[Begriffschrift]]'' introduced the notion of quantifier in a graphical notation, which here represents the judgement that &lt;math&gt;\forall x. F(x)&lt;/math&gt; is true.]]
{{main article|Predicate logic}}
Predicate logic is the generic term for symbolic formal systems such as [[first-order logic]], [[second-order logic]], [[many-sorted logic]], and [[infinitary logic]].  It provides an account of [[Quantifiers (logic)|quantifiers]] general enough to express a wide set of arguments occurring in natural language.   For example, [[Bertrand Russell]]'s famous [[barber paradox]], "there is a man who shaves all and only men who do not shave themselves" can be formalised by the sentence &lt;math&gt;(\exists x ) (\text{man}(x) \wedge (\forall y) (\text{man}(y) \rightarrow (\text{shaves}(x, y)  \leftrightarrow \neg \text{shaves}(y, y))))&lt;/math&gt;, using the non-logical predicate &lt;math&gt;\text{man}(x)&lt;/math&gt; to indicate that ''x'' is a man, and the non-logical relation &lt;math&gt;\text{shaves}(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; to indicate that ''x'' shaves ''y''; all other symbols of the formulae are logical, expressing the universal and existential [[quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]], [[logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[Material conditional|implication]], [[negation]] and [[biconditional]].

Whilst Aristotelian syllogistic logic specifies a small number of forms that the relevant part of the involved judgements may take, predicate logic allows sentences to be analysed into subject and argument in several additional ways—allowing predicate logic to solve the [[problem of multiple generality]] that had perplexed medieval logicians.

The development of predicate logic is usually attributed to [[Gottlob Frege]], who is also credited as one of the founders of [[analytical philosophy]], but the formulation of predicate logic most often used today is the first-order logic presented in [[Principles of Mathematical Logic]] by [[David Hilbert]] and [[Wilhelm Ackermann]] in 1928. The analytical generality of predicate logic allowed the formalization of mathematics, drove the investigation of [[set theory]], and allowed the development of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s approach to [[model theory]]. It provides the foundation of modern [[mathematical logic]].

Frege's original system of predicate logic was second-order, rather than first-order. [[Second-order logic]] is most prominently defended (against the criticism of [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] and others) by [[George Boolos]] and [[Stewart Shapiro]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Modal logic===
{{main article|Modal logic}}
In languages, [[Linguistic modality|modality]] deals with the phenomenon that sub-parts of a sentence may have their semantics modified by special verbs or modal particles. For example, "''We go to the games''" can be modified to give "''We should go to the games''", and "''We can go to the games''" and perhaps "''We will go to the games''". More abstractly, we might say that modality affects the circumstances in which we take an assertion to be satisfied. Confusing modality is known as the [[modal fallacy]].

[[Aristotle]]'s logic is in large parts concerned with the theory of non-modalized logic. Although, there are passages in his work, such as the famous [[problem of future contingents|sea-battle argument]] in ''[[De Interpretatione]]'' § 9, that are now seen as anticipations of modal logic and its connection with [[potentiality]] and time, the earliest formal system of modal logic was developed by [[Avicenna]], who ultimately developed a theory of "[[Temporal logic|temporally]] [[Modal logic|modalized]]" syllogistic.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 |title=History of logic: Arabic logic |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the study of necessity and possibility remained important to philosophers, little logical innovation happened until the landmark investigations of [[Clarence Irving Lewis]] in 1918, who formulated a family of rival axiomatizations of the alethic modalities. His work unleashed a torrent of new work on the topic, expanding the kinds of modality treated to include [[deontic logic]] and [[epistemic logic]].  The seminal work of [[Arthur Prior]] applied the same formal language to treat [[temporal logic]] and paved the way for the marriage of the two subjects. [[Saul Kripke]] discovered (contemporaneously with rivals) his theory of [[Kripke semantics|frame semantics]], which revolutionized the formal technology available to modal logicians and gave a new [[graph theory|graph-theoretic]] way of looking at modality that has driven many applications in [[computational linguistics]] and [[computer science]], such as [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]].

===Informal reasoning and dialectic===
{{main article|Informal logic|Logic and dialectic}}
The motivation for the study of logic in ancient times was clear: it is so that one may learn to distinguish good arguments from bad arguments, and so become more effective in argument and oratory, and perhaps also to become a better person. Half of the works of Aristotle's [[Organon]] treat inference as it occurs in an informal setting, side by side with the development of the syllogistic, and in the Aristotelian school, these informal works on logic were seen as complementary to Aristotle's treatment of [[rhetoric]].

This ancient motivation is still alive, although it no longer takes centre stage in the picture of logic; typically [[dialectic]]al logic forms the heart of a course in [[critical thinking]], a compulsory course at many universities.  Dialectic has been linked to logic since ancient times, but it has not been until recent decades that European and American logicians have attempted to provide mathematical foundations for logic and dialectic by formalising dialectical logic. [[Dialectical logic]] is also the name given to the special treatment of dialectic in [[Hegel]]ian and [[Marx]]ist thought.  There have been pre-formal treatises on argument and dialectic, from authors such as [[Stephen Toulmin]] (''The Uses of Argument''), [[Nicholas Rescher]] (''Dialectics''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rescher|first=Nicholas|title=Dialectics: A Controversy-Oriented Approach to the Theory of Knowledge|url=http://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/article/view/2809|date=1978|journal=Informal Logic|volume=1|issue=#3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hetherington|first=Stephen|title=Nicholas Rescher: Philosophical Dialectics|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/25075-philosophical-dialectics-an-essay-on-metaphilosophy/|date=2006|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|issue=2006.07.16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Jacquette, Dale|last=Rescher|first=Nicholas|title=Reason, Method, and Value: A Reader on the Philosophy of Nicholas Rescher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T65moyMMioYC|date=2009|publisher=Ontos Verlag|isbn=3110329050}}&lt;/ref&gt; and van Eemeren and Grootendorst ([[Pragma-dialectics]]).  Theories of [[defeasible reasoning]] can provide a foundation for the formalisation of dialectical logic and dialectic itself can be formalised as moves in a game, where an advocate for the truth of a proposition and an opponent argue.  Such games can provide a formal [[game semantics]] for many logics.

[[Argumentation theory]] is the study and research of informal logic, fallacies, and critical questions as they relate to every day and practical situations. Specific types of dialogue can be analyzed and questioned to reveal premises, conclusions, and fallacies. Argumentation theory is now applied in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[law]].

===Mathematical logic===
{{main article|Mathematical logic}}
Mathematical logic comprises two distinct areas of research: the first is the application of the techniques of formal logic to mathematics and mathematical reasoning, and the second, in the other direction, the application of mathematical techniques to the representation and analysis of formal logic.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Elementary Mathematical Logic"/&gt;

The earliest use of mathematics and [[geometry]] in relation to logic and philosophy goes back to the ancient Greeks such as [[Euclid]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle"/&gt; Many other ancient and medieval philosophers applied mathematical ideas and methods to their philosophical claims.&lt;ref name="Prior Analytics"/&gt;

One of the boldest attempts to apply logic to mathematics was the [[logicism]] pioneered by philosopher-logicians such as [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]. Mathematical theories were supposed to be logical [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], and the programme was to show this by means of a reduction of mathematics to logic.&lt;ref name="Principia"/&gt; The various attempts to carry this out met with failure, from the crippling of Frege's project in his ''Grundgesetze'' by [[Russell's paradox]], to the defeat of [[Hilbert's program]] by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]s.

Both the statement of Hilbert's program and its refutation by Gödel depended upon their work establishing the second area of mathematical logic, the application of mathematics to logic in the form of [[proof theory]].&lt;ref name="Introduction to Mathematical Logic5"/&gt; Despite the negative nature of the incompleteness theorems, [[Gödel's completeness theorem]], a result in [[model theory]] and another application of mathematics to logic, can be understood as showing how close logicism came to being true: every rigorously defined mathematical theory can be exactly captured by a first-order logical theory; Frege's [[proof calculus]] is enough to ''describe'' the whole of mathematics, though not ''equivalent'' to it.

If proof theory and model theory have been the foundation of mathematical logic, they have been but two of the four pillars of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Barwise (1982) divides the subject of mathematical logic into model theory, proof theory, set theory and recursion theory.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Set theory]] originated in the study of the infinite by [[Georg Cantor]], and it has been the source of many of the most challenging and important issues in mathematical logic, from [[Cantor's theorem]], through the status of the [[Axiom of Choice]] and the question of the independence of the [[continuum hypothesis]], to the modern debate on [[large cardinal]] axioms.

[[Recursion theory]] captures the idea of computation in logical and [[arithmetic]] terms; its most classical achievements are the undecidability of the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] by [[Alan Turing]], and his presentation of the [[Church–Turing thesis]].&lt;ref name="Theory of computation: formal languages, automata, and complexity"/&gt; Today recursion theory is mostly concerned with the more refined problem of [[complexity class]]es—when is a problem efficiently solvable?—and the classification of [[Turing degree|degrees of unsolvability]].&lt;ref name="Theory of computation: formal languages, automata, and complexity6"/&gt;

===Philosophical logic===
{{main article|Philosophical logic}}
[[Philosophical logic]] deals with formal descriptions of ordinary, non-specialist [[Natural language|("natural") language]], that is strictly only about the arguments within philosophy's other branches. Most philosophers assume that the bulk of everyday&lt;!--was: "normal" proper--&gt; reasoning can be captured in logic if a method or methods to translate ordinary language into that logic can be found. Philosophical logic is essentially a continuation of the traditional discipline called "logic" before the invention of mathematical logic. Philosophical logic has a much greater concern with the connection between natural language and logic. As a result, philosophical logicians have contributed a great deal to the development of non-standard logics (e.g. [[free logic]]s, [[tense logic]]s) as well as various extensions of [[classical logic]] (e.g. [[modal logic]]s) and non-standard semantics for such logics (e.g. [[Saul Kripke|Kripke]]'s [[supervaluationism]] in the semantics of logic).

Logic and the philosophy of language are closely related. Philosophy of language has to do with the study of how our language engages and interacts with our thinking. Logic has an immediate impact on other areas of study. Studying logic and the relationship between logic and ordinary speech can help a person better structure his own arguments and critique the arguments of others. Many popular arguments are filled with errors because so many people are untrained in logic and unaware of how to formulate an argument correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Epistemology and Cognition|first=Alvin I.|last=Goldman|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1986|isbn=9780674258969|page=293|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9XwhBw2jMqMC&amp;pg=PA293|quote=untrained subjects are prone to commit various sorts of fallacies and mistakes}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Intelligence, Mind, and Reasoning: Structure and Development|volume=106|series=Advances in Psychology|editor1-first=A.|editor1-last=Demetriou|editor2-first=A.|editor2-last=Efklides|publisher=Elsevier|year=1994|isbn=9780080867601|page=194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HkukZOU2pzIC&amp;pg=PA194}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational logic===
{{main article|Computational logic|Logic in computer science}}
[[File:Register transfer level - example toggler.svg|right|thumb|300px
|A simple toggling circuit is expressed using a logic gate and a synchronous register.]]
Logic cut to the heart of computer science as it emerged as a discipline: [[Alan Turing]]'s work on the ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' followed from [[Kurt Gödel]]'s work on the [[incompleteness theorems]]. The notion of the general purpose computer that came from this work was of fundamental importance to the designers of the computer machinery in the 1940s.

In the 1950s and 1960s, researchers predicted that when human knowledge could be expressed using logic with [[mathematical notation]], it would be possible to create a machine that reasons, or artificial intelligence. This was more difficult than expected because of the complexity of human reasoning. In [[logic programming]], a program consists of a set of axioms and rules. Logic programming systems such as [[Prolog]] compute the consequences of the axioms and rules in order to answer a query.

Today, logic is extensively applied in the fields of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[computer science]], and these fields provide a rich source of problems in formal and informal logic. [[Argumentation theory]] is one good example of how logic is being applied to artificial intelligence. The [[ACM Computing Classification System]] in particular regards:
* Section F.3 on [[Logics and meanings of programs]] and F.4 on [[Mathematical logic and formal languages]] as part of the theory of computer science: this work covers [[formal semantics of programming languages]], as well as work of [[formal methods]] such as [[Hoare logic]];
* [[Boolean logic]] as fundamental to computer hardware: particularly, the system's section B.2 on [[Arithmetic and logic structures]], relating to operatives [[logical conjunction|AND]], [[negation|NOT]], and [[logical disjunction|OR]];
* Many fundamental logical formalisms are essential to section I.2 on artificial intelligence, for example [[modal logic]] and [[default logic]] in [[Knowledge representation formalisms and methods]], [[Horn clause]]s in logic programming, and [[description logic]].

Furthermore, computers can be used as tools for logicians. For example, in symbolic logic and mathematical logic, proofs by humans can be computer-assisted. Using [[automated theorem proving]], the machines can find and check proofs, as well as work with proofs too lengthy to write out by hand.

===Non-classical logic===
{{Main article|Non-classical logic}}
The logics discussed above are all "[[Principle of bivalence|bivalent]]" or "two-valued"; that is, they are most naturally understood as dividing propositions into true and false propositions. [[Non-classical logic]]s are those systems that reject various rules of [[Classical logic]].

Hegel developed his own [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectic logic]] that extended [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s transcendental logic but also brought it back to ground by assuring us that "neither in heaven nor in earth, neither in the world of mind nor of nature, is there anywhere such an abstract 'either–or' as the understanding maintains. Whatever exists is concrete, with difference and opposition in itself".&lt;ref name="philosophical"/&gt;

In 1910, [[Nicolai A. Vasiliev]] extended the law of excluded middle and the law of contradiction and proposed the law of excluded fourth and logic tolerant to contradiction.&lt;ref name="Brenner2008"/&gt; In the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] investigated the extension of the traditional true/false values to include a third value, "possible", so inventing [[ternary logic]], the first [[multi-valued logic]] in the Western tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Logic For Dummies|first=Mark|last=Zegarelli|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2010|isbn=9781118053072|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xm0-0Rs2GVoC&amp;pg=PA30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Logics such as [[fuzzy logic]] have since been devised with an infinite number of "degrees of truth", represented by a [[real number]] between 0 and 1.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;

[[Intuitionistic logic]] was proposed by [[L.E.J. Brouwer]] as the correct logic for reasoning about mathematics, based upon his rejection of the [[law of the excluded middle]] as part of his [[intuitionism]]. Brouwer rejected formalization in mathematics, but his student [[Arend Heyting]] studied intuitionistic logic formally, as did [[Gerhard Gentzen]]. Intuitionistic logic is of great interest to computer scientists, as it is a [[constructive logic]] and sees many applications, such as extracting verified programs from proofs and influencing the design of [[programming language]]s through the [[formulae-as-types correspondence]].

[[Modal logic]] is not truth conditional, and so it has often been proposed as a non-classical logic. However, modal logic is normally formalized with the principle of the excluded middle, and its [[relational semantics]] is bivalent, so this inclusion is disputable.

==Controversies==
==="Is Logic Empirical?"===
{{details|Is Logic Empirical?}}
What is the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] status of the [[Classical logic|laws of logic]]? What sort of argument is appropriate for criticizing purported principles of logic? In an influential paper entitled "[[Is Logic Empirical?]]"&lt;ref name="Is Logic Empirical?"/&gt; [[Hilary Putnam]], building on a suggestion of [[W. V. Quine]], argued that in general the facts of propositional logic have a similar epistemological status as facts about the physical universe, for example as the laws of [[mechanics]] or of [[general relativity]], and in particular that what physicists have learned about quantum mechanics provides a compelling case for abandoning certain familiar principles of classical logic: if we want to be [[philosophical realism|realists]] about the physical phenomena described by quantum theory, then we should abandon the [[principle of distributivity]], substituting for classical logic the [[quantum logic]] proposed by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[John von Neumann]].&lt;ref name="The Logic of Quantum Mechanics"/&gt;

Another paper of the same name by [[Michael Dummett]] argues that Putnam's desire for realism mandates the law of distributivity.&lt;ref name="Truth and Other Enigmas"/&gt; Distributivity of logic is essential for the realist's understanding of how propositions are true of the world in just the same way as he has argued the principle of bivalence is. In this way, the question, "Is Logic Empirical?" can be seen to lead naturally into the fundamental controversy in [[metaphysics]] on [[realism versus anti-realism]].

===Implication: Strict or material===
{{main article|Paradoxes of material implication}}
The notion of implication formalized in classical logic does not comfortably translate into natural language by means of "if&amp;nbsp;... then&amp;nbsp;...", due to a number of problems called the [[paradoxes of material implication]].

The first class of paradoxes involves counterfactuals, such as ''If the moon is made of green cheese, then 2+2=5'', which are puzzling because natural language does not support the [[principle of explosion]]. Eliminating this class of paradoxes was the reason for [[C. I. Lewis]]'s formulation of [[strict implication]], which eventually led to more radically revisionist logics such as [[relevance logic]].

The second class of paradoxes involves redundant premises, falsely suggesting that we know the succedent because of the antecedent: thus "if that man gets elected, granny will die" is materially true since granny is mortal, regardless of the man's election prospects. Such sentences violate the [[Gricean maxim]] of relevance, and can be modelled by logics that reject the principle of [[monotonicity of entailment]], such as relevance logic.

===Tolerating the impossible===
{{main article|Paraconsistent logic}}
[[Hegel]] was deeply critical of any simplified notion of the [[law of non-contradiction]]. It was based on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'s idea that this law of logic also requires a sufficient ground to specify from what point of view (or time) one says that something cannot contradict itself. A building, for example, both moves and does not move; the ground for the first is our solar system and for the second the earth. In Hegelian dialectic, the law of non-contradiction, of identity, itself relies upon difference and so is not independently assertable.

Closely related to questions arising from the paradoxes of implication comes the suggestion that logic ought to tolerate [[inconsistency]]. [[Relevance logic]] and [[paraconsistent logic]] are the most important approaches here, though the concerns are different: a key consequence of [[classical logic]] and some of its rivals, such as [[intuitionistic logic]], is that they respect the [[principle of explosion]], which means that the logic collapses if it is capable of deriving a contradiction. [[Graham Priest]], the main proponent of [[dialetheism]], has argued for paraconsistency on the grounds that there are in fact, true contradictions.&lt;ref name="stanford7"/&gt;{{clarify|this is a provocative statement that deserves an inline example or Wikipedia explanation of some sort|date=October 2016}}

===Rejection of logical truth===
The philosophical vein of various kinds of skepticism contains many kinds of doubt and rejection of the various bases on which logic rests, such as the idea of logical form, correct inference, or meaning, typically leading to the conclusion that there are no [[logical truth]]s. This is in contrast with the usual views in [[philosophical skepticism]], where logic directs skeptical enquiry to doubt received wisdoms, as in the work of [[Sextus Empiricus]].

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] provides a strong example of the rejection of the usual basis of logic: his radical rejection of idealization led him to reject truth as a "...&amp;nbsp;mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms—in short&amp;nbsp;... metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins."&lt;ref name="nietzsche"/&gt; His rejection of truth did not lead him to reject the idea of either inference or logic completely, but rather suggested that "logic [came] into existence in man's head [out] of illogic, whose realm originally must have been immense. Innumerable beings who made inferences in a way different from ours perished".&lt;ref name="nietzsche8"/&gt; Thus there is the idea that logical inference has a use as a tool for human survival, but that its existence does not support the existence of truth, nor does it have a reality beyond the instrumental: "Logic, too, also rests on assumptions that do not correspond to anything in the real world".&lt;ref name="nietzsche9"/&gt;

This position held by Nietzsche however, has come under extreme scrutiny for several reasons. Some philosophers, such as [[Jürgen Habermas]], claim his position is self-refuting—and accuse Nietzsche of not even having a coherent perspective, let alone a theory of knowledge.&lt;ref name="nietzsche10"/&gt; [[Georg Lukács]], in his book ''The Destruction of Reason'', asserts that, "Were we to study Nietzsche's statements in this area from a logico-philosophical angle, we would be confronted by a dizzy chaos of the most lurid assertions, arbitrary and violently incompatible."&lt;ref name="marxists"/&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] described Nietzsche's irrational claims with "He is fond of expressing himself paradoxically and with a view to shocking conventional readers" in his book ''A History of Western Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=A History of Western Philosophy And Its Connection with Political and Social Circumstances from the Earliest Times to the Present Day|year=1945|publisher=Simon and Schuster|url=http://www.ntslibrary.com/PDF%20Books/History%20of%20Western%20Philosophy.pdf/|page=762|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528221822/http://www.ntslibrary.com/PDF%20Books/History%20of%20Western%20Philosophy.pdf|archivedate=28 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Support the [[AUTOSAR]] (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) standard (AUTOSAR is a [[standardized]] [[automotive software]] architecture)
* Develop the [[Functional Mock-up Interface]] standardized interface

The MODELISAR project started in 2008 , ended Dec 2011 to define the [[Functional Mock-up Interface]] specifications, deliver technology studies, prove the FMI concepts through Use Cases elaborated by the consortium partners and enable tool vendors to build advanced prototypes or in some cases even products.
MODELISAR has been awarded during ITEA 2 &amp; ARTEMIS co summit with a Silver award. See [https://web.archive.org/web/20120905081532/http://www.itea2.org/cosummit2012_achievementaward ITEA 2 achievement award]

Although in MODELISAR the focus was driven by automotive Use Cases, the FMI specifications could be independently defined. Therefore the FMI can now address others industrial domains such as Energy, Aerospace, Rail.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23467">'''Mnemic neglect''' is a term used in [[social psychology]] to describe a pattern of selective forgetting in which certain autobiographical memories tend to be recalled more easily if they are consistent with positive [[self-concept]].  The mnemic neglect model stipulates that memory is self-protective if the information is negative, self-referent, and concerns central traits. 
&lt;ref name="Pinter, B. 2011"&gt;Pinter, B., Green, J.D., Sedikides, C., &amp; Gregg, A.P. (2011) Self-protective memory: Separation/integration as a mechanism for mnemic neglect. Social Cognition, 29 (5), 612-624.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mnemic neglect model==
Experiments have been conducted to test for the specific conditions under which mnemic neglect occurs. A standard procedure has been used across several experiments to test for these conditions. In this procedure, participants are presented with a list of 32 behavioral traits. They are asked to either encode each trait as if it applied to them (i.e. "consider people describing you with these traits") or as if it applied to a stranger named Chris (i.e. "consider people describing Chris with these traits").&lt;ref name="Saunders 2"/&gt; Several of these experiments have found that the first condition under which mnemic neglect occurs is that the traits must be negative. Feedback from others is less easily recalled when it is negative in nature than when it is positive. Second, the information must be self-referent. Sedikides and Green (2004) conducted a study using the standard procedure in which half of the participants were asked to consider feedback as if it applied to them and half were asked to consider the same feedback as if it applied to someone else. They found that negative feedback was recalled as frequently as positive feedback when the feedback was directed at another. However, when the feedback was directed at oneself, negative feedback was recalled less frequently than positive feedback.&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt; Third, the information must pertain to a central, rather than peripheral, self-conception. A central self-conception is a generally positive trait that is considered fixed and highly descriptive (i.e. trustworthy vs. untrustworthy). In contrast, a peripheral self-conception is considered only moderately descriptive, less positive, and less important (i.e. modest vs. immodest). Feedback that counteracts a central self-conception is recalled much less frequently than feedback that counteracts a peripheral self-conception. In fact, the recall for feedback on modifiable traits was unaffected by whether the feedback was positive or negative.&lt;ref&gt;Green, J.D., Pinter, B., &amp; Sedikides, C. (2005). Mnemic neglect and self-threat: Trait modifiability moderates self-protection. European Journal of Social Psychology, 35 (2), 225-235.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypothesized mechanism==
Sedikides and Green (2004) offered a mechanism by which they believe mnemic neglect occurs. Self-referent information is processed in two stages. The first stage checks the information for compatibility with self-concept. Self-threatening information is confined to this stage because it is found to be incompatible with self-concept. During the second stage, self-flattering information is compared to similar [[episodic memories]]. The theory is that deeper processing occurs at the second stage, so information processed at this stage is recalled more easily.&lt;ref&gt;Sedikides, C., &amp; Green, J.D. (2004). What I don’t recall can’t hurt me: Information negativity versus information inconsistency as determinants of memorial self-defense. Social Cognition, 22 (1), 4-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although research has demonstrated a difference in recall between threatening and non-threatening information, there is no difference in recognition of threatening and non-threatening information.&lt;ref&gt;Wyer, R. S., Jr., Bodenhausen, G. V., &amp; Srull, T.K. (1984). The cognitive representation of persons and groups and its effect on recall and recognition memory. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 20, 445-469.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, self-threatening information is recalled less easily than non-threatening information but it is recognized equally well, meaning that subjects can identify whether they received the information or not regardless of its connotations. However, in a free recall task, subjects show a memory bias for non-threatening information. To account for this difference, Pinter, Green, Sedikides, and Gregg (2011) modified the suggested mechanism behind mnemic neglect. They hypothesized that people compare incoming information to past experience. If the information is consistent with self-knowledge, then the information is integrated with this knowledge. If the information is inconsistent with self-knowledge, then it is processed separately. Therefore, self-threatening information is less easily recalled but just as easily recognized as non-threatening information because separate processing leads to fewer retrieval routes.

This mechanism was tested by Pinter and his colleagues experimentally. Half of the participants were prompted to incorporate the information they were given into their self-concept. They were instructed to find similarities between the information and their self-knowledge and determine reasons for why the information described them. This process was termed integration. The other half of the participants were prompted to separate the information from their self-concept. They were asked to identify differences between the information and their self-knowledge and determine reasons for why the information did not describe them.  This process was termed separation. The first finding of the experiment was that recall for both positive and negative information was poorer for separation than for integration. However, recognition was the same between the two groups. The second finding was that self-protection is more important that self-enhancement. A greater effect was seen for attempting to integrate central negative information than for attempting to separate central positive information.&lt;ref name="Pinter, B. 2011"/&gt;

This mechanism has been challenged by those who believe that mnemic neglect is a product of expectancies rather than self-protection motives.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B. Jr. (1983). Self-verification: Bringing social reality into harmony with the self. In Psychological perspectives on the self, 2, 33–66.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, negative information is not processed as deeply as positive information because it is incompatible with self-concept as opposed to simply unflattering. People do not recall a behavior describing them that indicates untrustworthiness not because they want to protect themselves but because this behavior is inconsistent with how they would actually behave. This alternative explanation accounts for the absence of memory bias in recalling information about a stranger (Chris). People have no expectancies about this stranger Chris, so positive and negative information are processed equally well.&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;Newman, L.S., Nibert, J.A., &amp; Winer, E.S. (2009). Mnemic neglect is not an artifact of expectancy: The moderating role of defensive pessimism. European Journal of Social Psychology, 39 (3), 477-486&lt;/ref&gt;

Newman, Nibert, and Winer (2009) emphasized ruling out the possibility that mnemic neglect occurs due to incompatibility with expectancies. It was suspected that mnemic neglect might be an issue of self-verification rather than self-protection or self-enhancement. Self-verification and self-protection are difficult concepts to separate because most people tend to think of themselves favorably.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S. E., &amp; Brown, J. D. (1988). Illusion and well-being: A social psychological perspective on mental health. Psychological Bulletin, 103, 193–210.&lt;/ref&gt; Green and Sedikides (2004) attempted to address this concern by conducting two experiments. In one experiment, the participants were pre-selected. Half viewed themselves positively on certain dimensions and half viewed themselves negatively. All participants had better recall for positive dimensions. In another experiment, a stranger Chris was described to participants before they read the behaviors. Chris was described as a superhuman, incredibly kind and trustworthy, in an attempt to establish expectancies about Chris. Other participants in the same study were asked to imagine the traits described a close friend whom the participants hold in high regard. In comparison to these two cases, recall for positive traits was still better when these traits were self-referent rather than directed at another.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;Green, J. D., &amp; Sedikides, C. (2004). Retrieval selectivity in the processing of self-referent information: Testing the boundaries of selfprotection. Self and Identity, 3, 69–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these findings, the mechanism was still challenged because the results were open to interpretation. Perhaps participants had more favorable expectancies for themselves than for others. Newman, Nibert, and Winer (2009) sought to test the expectancies possibility more directly. They hypothesized that participants who were more focused on testing information against their expectancies would have different recall biases than participants who were more likely to be focused on self-protection. Defensive pessimists were identified as people who are more likely to focus on expectancies. Defensive pessimists think extensively about possible future outcomes, both positive and negative. Their ultimate goal is to be prepared. They should still exhibit a preference for positive over negative information, but they are more likely to approach a situation with “Is this a reasonable thing to expect?” as opposed to “Will this make me feel bad about myself?” Thus, it was hypothesized that defensive pessimists would recall more favorable than unfavorable behaviors in both themselves and others when subjected to the standard test for mnemic neglect. The findings supported the hypothesis. Defensive pessimists showed a bias for the recall of positive information over negative information for both themselves and others, thereby offering further support to the hypothesized mechanism of mnemic neglect (i.e. mnemic neglect is based on self-protection rather than self-verification).&lt;ref name="Newman"/&gt;

==Evidence against hypothesized mechanism==
The recollection of [[autobiographical memory|autobiographical memories]] can trigger emotions. Research shows that the intensity of the emotion experienced at the time of the event decreases over time, such that the intensity of the emotion associated with the recollection of the event is less than the intensity of the emotion experienced during the event.&lt;ref&gt;Hartnett, J. L., &amp; Skowronski, J. J. (2008). Tragic to hilarious: Why do some negative autobiographical memories become funny? Presented at the 80th Annual Meeting of the MidwesternPsychological Association, Chicago, IL, May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fading affect bias]] is a phenomenon in which emotions associated with a negative event fade faster than emotions associated with a positive event.

Like mnemic neglect, the fading affect bias is hypothesized to promote positive self-concept. Despite the similarities between mnemic neglect and fading affect bias, the hypothesized mechanisms of fading affect bias differ from that of mnemic neglect. One hypothesized mechanism of fading affect bias is that negative experiences are gradually reinterpreted as transformative events.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, L. J., &amp; Bluck, S. (2004). How emotions fade: Valence, appraisals, and the emotional impact of remembered events. Advances in psychology research, 30, 3–20.&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, these memories lose emotional intensity. For example, people often reinterpret hardships as opportunities to experience personal growth. A second hypothesized mechanism suggests that the conveying of autobiographical events to others minimizes negative aspects of the story and emphasizes positive aspects. In fact, a study by Skowronski, Gibbons, Vogl, and Walker (2004) demonstrated that fading affect bias is stronger for events frequently disclosed to others. Both of these mechanisms suggest that the superior retention of positive emotions over negative emotions is not a function of initial coding. Rather, poorer retention of negative emotions may be a function of recoding over time.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, W.R., &amp; Skowronski, J.L. (2009). The fading affect bias: But what the hell is it for? Applied Cognitive Psychology, 23 (8), 1122-1136.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limits of the mnemic neglect model: selective nature of self-protection==
One limitation of the mnemic neglect model is its inability to explain why people respond to negative information differently. Why is it that sometimes people react to negative feedback with defensive anger and other times with thoughtful reflection? Green, Sedikides, Pinter, and Van Tongeren (2009) conducted two experiments to determine the boundaries of mnemic neglect. They hypothesized that the self-protection aspect of mnemic neglect is flexible and that the mnemic neglect model is only upheld under certain conditions. More specifically, these researchers hypothesized that mnemic neglect does not occur when there is an opportunity for self-improvement and when feedback concerning an individual’s personality is provided in the context of a close relationship.

In their first experiment, these researchers tested the effect motivation to improve the self has on mnemic neglect. They hypothesized that mnemic neglect would not be observed in individuals motivated to enhance themselves because this motivation leads to deeper processing which in turn creates more retrieval routes. In this experiment, half of the participants were exposed to a task aimed to prime them for self-motivation. The other half was not exposed to this task. After the priming task, all of the participants were exposed to the standard test for mnemic neglect in which they were asked to read through a list of personality traits. Some were asked to imagine that the traits applied to them while others were asked to imagine that the traits applied to another named Chris. In the condition where self-improvement was primed, self-threatening and self-affirming information were recalled equally. Researchers believe that the findings of this experiment indicate the existence of a balance between the desire to protect oneself and the desire to improve oneself.

In their second experiment, participants signed up as pairs. Half of the participants were assigned to work with their partner while the other half were assigned to work with strangers. One of the partners completed a personality test. The other partner received the first partner’s answers to the personality test and rated each of the responses as either positive or negative. The first participant then had an opportunity to review each of their partner’s positive/negative ratings. After a brief distractor test, the first participant was asked to recall as many of their partner’s feedback ratings as possible. Researchers found that when the two partners had a close relationship, mnemic neglect was not demonstrated. When the two partners were strangers, mnemic neglect was maintained.

Green, Sedikides, Pinter, and Van Tongeren admit that further research must be conducted to determine the mechanism behind the effect relationships have on mnemic neglect. Feedback from close friends may be more useful because individuals feel more comfortable to use the feedback constructively if it is provided within a supportive relationship. An alternative explanation is that recalling feedback from a friend may be important for maintaining a healthy relationship. However, a third explanation is that individuals commit this feedback to memory so that they may better prepare counterarguments for the future.

This research opens the door for future research to investigate individual differences in order to create a list of [[moderator variable]]s that affect mnemic neglect.&lt;ref&gt;Green, J.D., Sedikides, C., Pinter, B., &amp; Van Tongeren, D.R. (2009). Two sides to self-protection: Self-improvement strivings and feedback from close relationships eliminate mnemic neglect. Self and Identity, 8 (2-3), 233-250.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mnemic neglect and dysphoria==
[[Mood (psychology)|Mood]] can affect cognitive performance.&lt;ref name="Saunders 2"/&gt; Research has demonstrated that individuals with [[dysphoria]] recall negative information more easily than positive information&lt;ref&gt;Burt, D. B., Zembar, M. J., &amp; Niederehe, G. (1995). Depression and memory impairment. A meta analysis of the association, its pattern, and specificity. Psychological Bulletin, 117, 285-305.&lt;/ref&gt; Saunders (2011) conducted three experiments to determine the relationship between dysphoria and mnemic neglect. In the first experiment, it was hypothesized that dysphoric patients are prone to malfunctioning mnemic neglect. They suffer from the inability to forget negative information. Thus, they should have better recall for self-threatening information than nondysphoric individuals. Participants were subjects to the standard mnemic neglect test procedure. It was determined that people with dysphoria have greater recall for central negative information. It was further hypothesized that a defect in mnemic neglect leads to more negative memories.

Experiment 1 also indicated that dysphoria patients had better recall for central negative information than peripheral negative information. Thus, it was hypothesized a reverse mnemic neglect model in dysphoria patients. For the second experiment, the same traits were presented to two separate groups of dysphoria patients. The first group received information before receiving the list of traits that described the traits as all unmodifiable, meaning that if one exhibits the trait as a child, he or she will certainly exhibit the trait as an adult. The second group received information that described the traits as all modifiable, meaning that if one exhibits the trait as a child, he or she can change as an adult. It was concluded that dysphoria patients recall unmodifiable traits better than they do modifiable traits.

In Experiment 3, it was hypothesized that individuals with dysphoria would demonstrate better recall for highly diagnostic behaviors than low diagnostic behaviors. A highly diagnostic behavior is one that is very descriptive of a trait. For instance, “I can keep secrets” is highly diagnostic of the trait trustworthiness. A low diagnostic behavior for trustworthiness might be “I would take a pen from a bank after using it”. This experiment followed the same procedure as Experiment 1 except that half of the dysphoria patients were presented highly diagnostic behaviors and half were presented low diagnostic behaviors. As expected, the participants negative information was more easily recalled when the information was highly diagnostic as opposed to low diagnostic.

Saunders explains her findings by suggesting that self-referent, negative, central information receives elaboration form dysphoric patients. They process this information more deeply than nondysphoric patients. In addition, individuals with dysphoria may have inhibitory deficits, where they are unable to keep negative information from flooding their conscious minds. These difficulties in suppressing negative memories could explain why the negative mood is sustained.

Dysphoric patients rated central negative traits just as negative as nondysphoric patients did, but they rated these traits as more important. It has been argued that the differences in mnemic neglect between individuals with and without dysphoria can be explained by mood-dependent memory (link). Simply, individuals with dysphoria believe that negative information is more self-referent than positive information. However, Saunders argues that there are effects beyond mood-dependent memory because the same effect would be seen for peripheral negative information, which in fact saw no difference in recall between the two groups. She also emphasizes that she would not have observed differences for modifiability and diagnosticity either if this were the case.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, J. (2011). Reversed mnemic neglect of self-threatening memories in dysphoria. Cognition &amp; Emotion, 25 (5), 854-867.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mnemic neglect and anxiety==
There is evidence that individuals with [[anxiety]] also experience reverse mnemic neglect. Many studies have found no difference in memory bias between anxious and non-anxious individuals,&lt;ref&gt;Dalgliesh, T. (1994). The relationship between anxiety and memory biases for material that has been selectively processed in a prior task. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 32, 227-231&lt;/ref&gt; but these studies have been criticized for using traits low in self-reference.&lt;ref name="Saunders 2"&gt;Saunders, J. (2013). Selective memory bias for self-threatening memories in trait anxiety. Cognition &amp; Emotion, 27(1), 21-36&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis conducted by Mitte (2008) found that anxious individuals have better recall than non-anxious individuals for negative information and that non-anxious individuals have better recall than anxious individuals for neutral and positive information.&lt;ref&gt;Mitte, K. (2008). Memory bias for self-threatening information in anxiety and anxiety disorders: A meta-analytic review. Psychological Bulletin, 134, 886-911&lt;/ref&gt;

Saunders (2013) hypothesized that highly anxious individuals have better recall for central, negative traits than non-anxious individuals. A series of three experiments was conducted. Experiment 1 used the standard mnemic neglect procedure to compare the recall for various traits between high-anxious participants and low-anxious participants. As hypothesized, high-anxious participants showed greater recall than did low-anxious participants for central, negative traits.

Experiment 2 tested for the recall of highly diagnostic traits. It was hypothesized that high-anxious participants would show mnemic neglect for modifiable traits because these traits are not perceived as very threatening. However, unmodifiable traits would be immune to mnemic neglect for these participants and thus they would be recalled more easily. In this experiment, traits were either presented following a description of the traits as being changeable over time or following a description of the traits as being unalterable throughout life. As hypothesized, anxious participants were able to recall more unmodifiable than modifiable central negative traits.

It was hypothesized that anxious participants have better recall for highly diagnostic central negative traits. Diagnosticity refers to how well a behavior indicates an underlying trait. In experiment 3, both anxious and non-anxious participants were asked to rate how diagnostic each behavior was of a trait (i.e. Based on this behavior, how likely is it that this person is trustworthy?). No difference in diagnostic ratings was found between the two groups. However, anxious participants had higher recall than non-anxious participants for highly diagnostic central negative traits when they directed at themselves.

Thus, reverse mnemic neglect is experienced for unmodifiable and highly diagnostic traits among high-anxious individuals.&lt;ref name ="Saunders 2"/&gt;

{{Essay-like|date=January 2008}}
{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
{{nihongo|'''''Muda'''''|[[wikt:無駄|無駄]]}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word meaning "futility; uselessness; wastefulness",&lt;ref&gt;''Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary'', 5th edition, 2003, Tokyo: Kenkyusha, p. 2530.&lt;/ref&gt; and is a key concept in [[Lean manufacturing|lean process thinking]], like the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS) as one of the three types of deviation from optimal allocation of resources (the others being ''[[mura (Japanese term)|mura]]'' and ''[[muri (Japanese term)|muri]]'').&lt;ref name = emiliani-better-thinking&gt;{{cite book | title = Better thinking, better results: case study and analysis of an enterprise-wide lean transformation | first1 = Bob  | last1 = Emiliani | first2 = David | last2 = Stec | first3 = Lawrence | last3 = Grasso  | first4 = James | last4 = Stodder | location =  Kensington, Conn | publisher = Center for Lean Business Management | year = 2007 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 978-0-9722591-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Waste reduction]] is an effective way to increase profitability. 

From an end-customer's point of view, value-added work is any activity that produces goods or provides a service for which a customer is willing to pay; ''muda'' is any constraint or impediment that causes waste to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kato |first1=Isao  |authorlink1=Isao Kato |last2=Smalley |first2=Art |authorlink2=Art Smalley |date=2011 |title=Toyota Kaizen Methods: Six Steps to Improvement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of muda:&lt;ref&gt;Lean Enterprise Institute, [https://www.lean.org/lexicon/waste Waste], accessed 3 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Muda Type I''': non value-adding, but necessary for end-customers. These are usually harder to eliminate because while classified as non-value adding, they may still be necessary. For example, while an end-customer might not view quality inspection in car assembly as value-adding, it is necessary to ensure the car meets safety standards.
* '''Muda Type II''': non value-adding and unnecessary for end-customers. These contribute to waste, incur hidden costs, and should be eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sayer |first1=Natalie |last2=Williams |first2=Bruce |date=2012 |title=Lean For Dummies 2nd Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The seven forms of waste==
One of the key steps in lean process and TPS is to identify which activities add value and which do not, then to progressively work to improve or eliminate them. 

[[Taiichi Ohno]], "father" of the Toyota Production System, originally identified seven forms of ''muda'' or waste:&lt;ref&gt;Ohno, T. (1988), ''Toyota Production System: Beyond Large Scale Production'', Productivity Press, Portland, Oregon&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Different kinds of waste in lean manufacturing.png|7 types of waste identified in lean manufacturing]]

Later, an eighth waste, unused skills, was added.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

A mnemonic may be useful for remembering the categories of waste, such as TIM WOOD or TIM WOODS:&lt;ref&gt;Phillips Healthcare Ultrasound Division. "Gemba Tour: Come and see for yourself." 2016. Pamphlet distributed by Philips Ultrasound Factory in Bothell, WA.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==={{font color|red|T}}ransportation===
Every time a product is touched or moved unnecessarily there is a risk that it could be damaged, lost, delayed, etc. as well as being a cost for no added value. Transportation does not add value to the product, i.e. is not a transformation for which the consumer is willing to pay.

==={{font color|red|I}}nventory===
Whether in the form of raw materials, [[Work in process|work-in-progress]] (WIP), or finished goods, represents a capital outlay that cannot yet produce an income. The longer a product sits in one of these states, the more it contributes to waste. The smooth, continuous flow of work through each process ensures excess amounts of inventory are minimized. 

==={{font color|red|M}}otion===
In contrast to transportation, which refers to damage and transaction costs associated with moving the product, motion refers to the damage and costs inflicted on what creates the product. This can include [[wear and tear]] for equipment, [[Repetitive strain injury|repetitive strain injuries]] for workers, or unnecessary downtime.

==={{font color|red|W}}aiting===
Whenever the product is not in transportation or being processed, it is waiting (typically in a queue). In traditional processes, a large part of an individual product's life is spent waiting to be worked on. 

==={{font color|red|O}}ver-production===
Making more of a product than is required results in several forms of waste, typically caused by production in large batches. The customer's needs often change over the time it takes to produce a larger batch. Over-production has been described as the worst kind of waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.consulting-xp.com/blog/?p=546|title=Why is Overproduction the Worst Muda? |publisher=XP Consulting|work=Le BLOG|date=4 January 2015|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{font color|red|O}}ver-processing===
Doing more to a product than is required by the end-customer results in it taking longer and costing more to produce. This also includes using components that are more precise, complex, expensive or higher quality than absolutely required.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==={{font color|red|D}}efects===
Having to discard or rework a product due to earlier defective work or components results in additional cost and delays.

==Unused skills==
Organizations often under-utilize the skills their workers have or permit workers to operate in silos so that knowledge is not shared. This was added to the original seven forms of waste, as resolving this waste is a key enabler to resolving the others.&lt;ref&gt;Liker (2004) - The Toyota Way (p.28)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative forms of waste==
The eight forms of waste were developed for Toyota specific processes. Companies have further identified such other forms of waste as:{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Confusion ===
{{Main|Confusion}}
General uncertainty about the right thing to do, or absence of documented procedures and operating statements.

===Self-doubt===
Writer [[James P. Womack|Jim Womack]] described "thinking you can't" as the worst form of waste, quoting [[Henry Ford]]'s [[aphorism]]:
:''Henry Ford probably said it best when he noted, "You can think you can achieve something or you can think you can't and you will be right.''&lt;ref&gt;Womack, J., [https://www.lean.org/womack/DisplayObject.cfm?o=763 The Worst Form of Muda], published 14 August 2008, accessed 3 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
[[Shigeo Shingo]] divides process related activity into Process and Operation.&lt;ref&gt;A study of the Toyota Production System, Shigeo Shingo, Productivity Press, 1989, p xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; He distinguishes "Process", the course of material that is transformed into product, from "Operation" which are the actions performed on the material by workers and machines. This distinction is not generally recognized because most people would view the "Operations" performed on the raw materials of a product by workers and machines as the "Process" by which those raw materials are transformed into the final product. He makes this distinction because value is added to the product by the process but not by most of the operations. He states that whereas many see Process and Operations in parallel he sees them at right angles (orthogonal) (see [[Value Stream Mapping]]). This starkly throws most of the operations into the waste category.

Many of the TPS/Lean techniques work in a similar way. By planning to reduce manpower, or reduce change-over times, or reduce campaign lengths, or reduce lot sizes the question of waste comes immediately into focus upon those elements that prevent the plan being implemented. Often it is in the operations' area rather than the process area that muda can be eliminated and remove the blockage to the plan. Tools of many types and methodologies can then be employed on these wastes to reduce or eliminate them.

The plan is therefore to build a fast, flexible process where the immediate impact is to reduce waste and therefore costs. By ratcheting the process towards this aim with focused muda reduction to achieve each step, the improvements are 'locked in' and become required for the process to function. Without this intent to build a fast, flexible process there is a significant danger that any improvements achieved will not be sustained because they are ''just'' desirable and can slip back towards old behaviours without the process stopping.

The word was brought across cultures as the "catchword" of [[Dio Brando]], a central antagonist from the popular, long running manga series [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]. The word would go on to be repeated rapidly as the stand cry of Dio and later his son, Giorno Giovanna.

{{Burmese script}}
The traditional '''Burmese units of measurement''' are still in everyday use in [[Myanmar]] (also known as Burma). According to the CIA Factbook, Myanmar is one of three countries that have not adopted the [[International System of Units]] (SI) [[metric system]] as their official system of weights and measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/appendix/print_appendix-g.html |title=The World Factbook, Appendix G: Weights and Measures |year=2010 |work=Web Pages |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate=10 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528121337/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/appendix/print_appendix-g.html |archivedate=28 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in June 2011, the [[Government of Burma|Burmese government]]'s [[Ministry of Commerce (Burma)|Ministry of Commerce]] began discussing proposals to reform the measurement system in Burma and adopt the metric system used by most of its trading partners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = &amp;#91;USMA:50911&amp;#93; RE: Ditch the viss, govt urges traders|date = 24 July 2011|publisher = The Mail Archive|work = The Myanmar Times|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110807132552/http://www.mail-archive.com/usma@colostate.edu/msg40068.html|archive-date=7 August 2011 |access-date = 2015-09-19|via = The Internet Archive|url = https://www.mail-archive.com/usma@colostate.edu/msg40068.html|at = (At bottom of page)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in October 2013, Dr. Pwint San, Deputy Minister for Commerce, announced that the country was preparing to adopt the metric system.&lt;ref name=convert&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.elevenmyanmar.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3684:myanmar-to-adopt-metric-system&amp;catid=44:national&amp;Itemid=384| title=Myanmar to adopt metric system| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324092305/http://elevenmyanmar.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3684:myanmar-to-adopt-metric-system&amp;catid=44:national&amp;Itemid=384| archive-date=2015-03-24| dead-url=yes| website=www.elevenmyanmar.com |publisher=[[Eleven Media Group]] |access-date=2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the nation uses Burmese units only, although Burmese government web pages in English use [[Imperial units|imperial]] and [[Metric system|metric]] units inconsistently. For instance, the Ministry of Construction uses miles to describe the length of roads&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.construction.gov.mm/PW/Activities.htm |title=Public Works, Fields Of Activities |year=2006 |work=Web Page |publisher=Ministry Of Construction |accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and square feet for the size of houses,&lt;ref name="Housing Development"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.construction.gov.mm/DHSH/HousingD.htm |title=Housing Development |year= 2006 |work=web page |publisher=Ministry Of Construction |accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but square kilometres for the total land area of new town developments in Yangon City.&lt;ref name="Housing Development"/&gt; The Ministry of Agriculture uses acres for land areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moai.gov.mm/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=2 |title=Ministry of Agriculture and Information |date=2009–2010 |work=Web Page |publisher=Myanmar Agriculture |accessdate=11 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613032846/http://www.moai.gov.mm/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=2 |archivedate=13 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs uses kilometres (with mile equivalents in parentheses) to describe the dimensions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mofa.gov.mm/aboutmyanmar/geography.html |title=About Myanmar : Geography |year=2009 |work=web page |publisher= The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Myanmar |accessdate=11 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805022516/http://www.mofa.gov.mm/aboutmyanmar/geography.html |archivedate=5 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Noema''' (plural: ''noemata'') derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word νόημα meaning "thought" or "what is thought about."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bunnin and Jiyuan Yu (ed.s) ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2004, p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Husserl]] used ''noema'' as a technical term in [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] to stand for the object or content of a thought, judgement, or perception, but its precise meaning in his work has remained a matter of controversy.

==Husserl's noema==

In ''[[Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology]]'' (1913), Husserl introduced the terms "noema" and "[[noesis]]" to designate correlated elements of the structure of any intentional act — for example, an act of perceiving, or judging, or remembering:

"Corresponding to all points to the manifold data of the real (''reelle'') noetic content, there is a variety of data displayable in really pure (''wirklicher reiner'') intuition, and in a correlative 'noematic content,' or briefly 'noema' — terms which we shall henceforth be continually using."&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Husserl, ''Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology'' (also known as ''Ideas I''), trans. W. Boyce Gibson, Collier Books, 1962, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Every intentional act has noetic content (or a noesis — from the Greek [[nous]], "mind").  This noetic content, to which the noema corresponds, is that mental act-process (e.g., an act of liking, of judging, of meaning, etc.) which becomes directed towards the intentionally held object (e.g., the liked as liked, judged as judged, or meant as meant).&lt;ref&gt;Dermot Moran, ''Edmund Husserl: founder of phenomenology'' Polity, 2005, p133&lt;/ref&gt;  That is to say, every act has, as part of its formation, a noematic correlate, which is the object of the act — that which is intended by it.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Husserl, ''Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology'' (also known as ''Ideas I''), trans. W. Boyce Gibson, Collier Books, 1962, p229&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, every intentional act has an "I-pole (the origin of the noesis)" and an "object-pole (or noema)."&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Francois Lyotard, ''Phenomenology'', trans. Brian Beakley, SUNY Press, 1991, p55&lt;/ref&gt;  Husserl also refers to the noema as the ''Sinn'' or sense (meaning) of the act, and sometimes appears to use the terms interchangeably.  Nevertheless, the ''[[Sinn]]'' does not represent what Husserl calls the "full noema": ''Sinn'' belongs to the noema, but the full noema is the object of the act ''as meant'' in the act, the perceived object ''as'' perceived, the judged object ''as'' judged, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Dermot Moran, ''Edmund Husserl: founder of phenomenology'' Polity, 2005, p135; see also Edmund Husserl, ''Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology'' (also known as ''Ideas I''), trans. W. Boyce Gibson, Collier Books, 1962, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, the noema seems to be whatever is intended by acts of perception or judgement in general, whether it be "a material object, a picture, a word, a mathematical entity, another person" precisely ''as'' being perceived, judged or otherwise thought about.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Sokolowski, ''Introduction to Phenomenology'', Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpreting Husserl==

In fact, commentators have been unable to achieve consensus on exactly what a noema is.  In a recent survey, David Woodruff Smith distinguished four different schools of thought.  On one view, to say that the noema is the intentional object of an act of consciousness is to mean that it quite literally is an object.  Husserl’s student [[Roman Ingarden]], for example, held that both ordinary objects, like chairs and trees, and intentional objects, like a chair precisely as it appears to me, or even a fictional tree, actually exist, but have different "modes" of existence.&lt;ref&gt;David Woodruff Smith, ''Husserl'', Routledge, 2007, pp. 304-305&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative view, developed primarily by Aron Gurwitsch, emphasizes the noema of perceptual experience.  Most ordinary objects can be perceived in different ways and from different perspectives (consider looking at a tree from several different positions).  For Gurwitsch, what is perceived in each such act is a noema, and the object itself – the tree, say – is to be understood as the collection or system of noemata associated with it.  This view has similarities with [[phenomenalism]].&lt;ref&gt;David Woodruff Smith, ''Husserl'', Routledge, 2007, pp. 305-306&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Sokolowski|Sokolowski]], alternatively, holds that a noema is just the actual object of perception or judgment itself, considered phenomenologically.  In other words, the noema of the judgment that “this chair is uncomfortable” is neither an entity (the chair considered as uncomfortable) which exists in addition to the chair itself (but with a different mode of existence) – the Ingarden view; nor is the noema of such a judgment identified with a particular tactile perception of the chair – which along with other perceptions constitutes the chair as such – the Gurwitsch view.  For Sokolowski, the noema is not a separate entity at all, but the chair itself ''as'' in this instance perceived or judged.  This seems consistent with Husserl’s emphasis on the noema as the "perceived as such…remembered as such…judged as such…"&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Husserl, ''Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology'' (also known as ''Ideas I''), trans. W. Boyce Gibson, Collier Books, 1962, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Analytic philosopher [[Dagfinn Føllesdal]], in an influential 1969 paper,&lt;ref&gt;Dagfinn Føllesdal, "Husserl’s Notion of Noema" ''Journal of Philosophy'' LXVI:20, 1969, pp. 680-687&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a Fregean interpretation of the noema, which has been developed extensively by Ronald McIntyre and David Woodruff Smith.&lt;ref&gt;David Woodruff Smith and Ronald McIntyre, "Intentionality via Intensions" Journal of Philosophy LXVIII:18, 1971, pp541-561; Ronald McIntyre and David Woodruff Smith, "Theory of Intentionality" in J.N. Mohanty and William R. McKenna (eds) Husserl’s Phenomenology: a Textbook, Center for Advanced Research in Phenomenology and University Press of America, 1989, pp. 147-179; see also David Woodruff Smith, ''Husserl'', Routledge, 2007, especially chapter six.&lt;/ref&gt;  This school of thought agrees that the noema is not a separate entity, but rather than identifying it with the actual object of the act (of perceiving, judging, etc.), phenomenologically understood, this view suggests that it is a mediating component of the act itself.  It is what gives the act the sense it has.&lt;ref&gt;David Woodruff Smith, ''Husserl'', Routledge, 2007, pp. 306-307&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, Føllesdal and his followers suggest that the noema is a generalized version of [[Frege]]’s account of linguistic meaning, and in particular of his concept of [[Sense and reference|sense]] (''Sinn'').  Just as Frege held that a linguistic expression picks out its reference by means of its sense, so Husserl believed that conscious acts generally – not merely acts of meaning but also acts of perception, judgment, etc. – are intentionally directed toward objects by means of their noemata.  On this view, the noema is not an object, but an abstract component of certain types of acts.&lt;ref&gt;David Woodruff Smith and Ronald McIntyre, "Intentionality via Intensions" ''Journal of Philosophy'' LXVIII:18, 1971, pp. 541-542&lt;/ref&gt;

Sokolowski has continued to reject this approach, arguing that "(t)o equate sense and noema would be to equate propositional and phenomenological reflection.  It would take philosophy simply as the critical reflection on our meanings or senses; it would equate philosophy with linguistic analysis." &lt;ref&gt;Robert Sokolowski, ''Introduction to Phenomenology'', Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert C. Solomon attempted to reconcile the perception-based interpretation of the Gurwitsch school with the Fregean interpretation of noema as sense, suggesting that while "(i)t has now become virtually axiomatic among phenomenologists that the ''Sinne'' [senses] of experience stand independent of the ''Bedeutungen'' [meanings] of linguistic expressions.  It has become all but axiomatic among [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]] that there is no meaning apart from language.  It is the concept of the noema that provides the link between them.  The noema embodies both the changing phases of experience and the organizing sense of our experience.  But these two 'components' are not separable, for all experience requires meaning, not as an after-the-fact luxury in reflective judgements but in order for it to be experience ''of'' anything.”&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Solomon, "Husserl’s Concept of the Noema" in Frederick Elliston and Peter McCormick (eds) ''Husserl: Expositions and Appraisals'' University of Notre Dame Press, 1977, pp. 168-181; see p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
''Noema'' is in the ''[[OED]]'', which has shown its use for more than three centuries. It first was used in English in the field of [[rhetoric]] to denote "a figure of speech whereby something stated obscurely is nevertheless intended to be understood or worked out." In other words, a ''noema'' in rhetoric is obscure speech or speech that only yields meaning upon detailed reflection.

Peacham's 1577 ''Garden of Eloquence''&lt;ref&gt;Peacham's 1577 Garden of Eloquence – Publications from Stockholm University [http://www.diva-portal.org/su/abstract.xsql?dbid=6663]&lt;/ref&gt; used it this way, &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Noema, when we doe signify some thing so privily that the hearers must be fayne to seeke out the meaning by long consideration." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2393">'''Pancritical rationalism''' (literally "criticism of all things", from [[wikt:pan-|pan-]], "all", also known as '''PCR'''), also called '''comprehensively critical rationalism''' ('''CCR'''), is a development of [[critical rationalism]] and [[panrationalism]] originated by [[William Warren Bartley]] in his book ''[[The Retreat to Commitment]]''. PCR attempts to work around the problem of ultimate commitment or infinite regress by decoupling criticism and justification. A pancritical rationalist holds all positions open to criticism, including PCR itself. Such a position in principle never resorts to [[appeal to authority]] for justification of stances, since all authorities are held to be intrinsically [[Fallibilism|fallible]].

== History ==
[[Allan Paivio]]'s [[dual-coding theory]] is a basis of picture superiority effect. Paivio claims that pictures have advantages over words with regards to coding and retrieval of stored memory because pictures are coded more easily and can be retrieved from symbolic mode, while the dual coding process using words is more difficult for both coding and retrieval. Another explanation of the higher recall in picture superiority is due to the higher familiarity or frequency of pictured objects (Asch &amp; Ebenholtz, 1962).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to dual-coding theory (1971, 1986), memory exists either (or both) verbally or "imaginally". [[Abstract and concrete|Concrete]] concepts presented as pictures are encoded into both systems; however, [[abstraction|abstract]] concepts are recorded only verbally. In [[psychology]], the effect has implications for [[Social salience|salience]] in [[attribution theory]] as well as the [[availability heuristic]]. It is also relevant to [[advertising]] and [[user interface design]].

==Related theories==

===Paivio – Dual coding theory===

Picture stimuli have an advantage over word stimuli because they are dually encoded; they generate a verbal and image code, whereas word stimuli only generate a verbal code. Pictures are likely to generate a verbal label, whereas words are not likely to generate image labels.&lt;ref name="McBride"/&gt;

===Nelson – Sensory semantic theory===

Pictures hold two encoding advantages over words. Pictures are perceptually more distinct from one another than are words, thus increasing their chance for retrieval. In experiments when similarity among pictures was high, no picture superiority effect was present. Pictures are also believed to assess meaning more directly than words.  Levels of processing theory apply when words and pictures are compared under semantic study instructions (rate the pleasantness of each item), recall is very similar for pictures and words, as both were encoded at deeper levels.&lt;ref name="McBride"/&gt;

Picture superiority results from superior encoding for pictures as opposed to words, which facilitate greater recollection for pictures.&lt;ref name="curran"/&gt;

=== Weldon and Roediger-transfer appropriate processing theories ===
Greater overlap of processing at study and test result in increased performance. TAP accounts for picture superiority by an interaction of encoding and retrieval. If items are encoded during a semantic task, performance should be higher for a memory test that relies on concepts related to the items for retrieval than a test that relies on perceptual features.&lt;ref name="McBride"/&gt;

==Evidence==

This effect has been shown to occur in recognition memory tasks, where items studied as pictures are better remembered than items studied as words, even when targets are presented as words during the test phase.&lt;ref name="defeyter"/&gt; Whether the picture superiority effect influences the familiarity and/or recollection processes, according to the dual-process models, thought to underlie recognition memory is not clear.&lt;ref name="curran"/&gt;

In experiments of associative recognition memory, participants studied random concrete word pairs, and line drawing pairs. They had to discriminate between intact and rearranged pairs at test. The picture superiority effect continued to express a strong effect with a greater hit rate for intact picture pairs. This further supports encoding theories&lt;ref name="hockley2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hockley | first1 = W. E. | year = 2008 | title = The picture superiority effect in associative recognition | url = | journal = Memory &amp; Cognition | volume = 36 | issue = 7| pages = 1351–1359 | doi = 10.3758/MC.36.7.1351 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research in associative recognition shows support that semantic meaning of nameable pictures is activated faster than that of words, allowing for more meaningful associations between items depicted as pictures to be generated.&lt;ref name="hockley2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hockley | first1 = W.E. | last2 = Bancroft | first2 = T. | year = 2011 | title = Extensions of the picture superiority effect in associative recognition | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 65 | issue = 4| pages = 236–244 | doi = 10.1037/a0023796 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pictures have distinctive features that enable to distinguish pictures from words and such discriminability increase memory ability in comparison with verbal cues (Jenkins, Neale &amp; Deno, 19&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jenkins|first=Joseph R|last2=Neale|first2=Daniel C|last3=Reno|first3=Stanley L|date=1967|title=Differential memory for picture and word stimuli|url=|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|doi=10.1037/h0025025|volume=58|pages=303–307}}&lt;/ref&gt; 67). Picture Superiority effect was also evident for memory recall during semantic procession (Childers &amp; Houston, 1984&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Childers|first=Terry L|last2=Houston|first2=Michael J|year=1984|title=Conditions for a picture-superiority effect on consumer memory|url=|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|doi=10.1086/209001|volume=11|page=643}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Moreover, pictures in pairs or group were better organized in our memory than words thus resulting in superiority in recall (Pavio &amp; Csapo, 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paivio|first=Allan|last2=Csapo|first2=Kalman|date=1973|title=Picture superiority in free recall: Imagery or dual coding?|url=|journal=Cognitive Psychology|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(73)90032-7|volume=5|pages=176–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The picture superiority effect is also present in spatial memory, where locations of items and photographs were remembered better than locations of words.&lt;ref name="cattaneo"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cattaneo | first1 = Z. | last2 = Rosen | first2 = M. | last3 = Vecchi | first3 = T. | last4 = Pelz | first4 = J. B. | year = 2008 | title = Monitoring eye movements to investigate the picture superiority effect in spatial memory | url = | journal = Perception | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 34–49 | doi = 10.1068/p5623 | pmid = 18399246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critique ==
The advantage of pictures over words is only evident when visual similarity is not a reliable cue; because it takes longer to understand pictures than words (Snodgrass &amp; McCullough, 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snodgrass|first=Joan G|last2=McCullough|first2=Brian|date=1987|title=The role of visual similarity in picture categorisation|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.12.1.147|pmid=|access-date=|volume=12|pages=147–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Pictures are only superior to words for list learning because differentiation is easier for pictures (Dominowski &amp; Gadlin, 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dominowski|first=Roger L|last2=Gadlin|first2=Howard|date=1968|title=Imagery and paired-associate learning|url=|journal=Canadian Journal of Psychology/Revue canadienne de psychologie|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In reverse picture superiority it was observed that learning was much slower when the responses were pictures (Postman, 1978&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Postman|first=Leo|date=1978|title=Picture-word differences in the acquisition and retention of paired associates|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Words produced a faster response than pictures and pictures did not have an advantages of having easier access to sematic memory or superior effect over words for dual-coding theory (Amrhein, McDaniel &amp; Waddill 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amrhein|first=Paul C|last2=McDaniel|first2=Mark|last3=Waddill|first3=Paula|date=2002|title=Revisiting the picture superiority effect in symbolic comparison: Do pictures provide privileged access?|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.28.5.843|pmid=|access-date=|volume=28|pages=843–857}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Similarly, studies where response time deadlines have been implemented, the reverse superiority effect was reported. This is related to the dual-process model of familiarity and recollection. When deadlines for the response were short, the process of familiarity was present, along with an increased tendency to recall words over pictures. When response deadlines were longer, the process of recollection was being utilized, and a strong picture superiority effect was present.&lt;ref name="boldini"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boldini | first1 = A. | last2 = Russo | first2 = R. | last3 = Punia | first3 = S. | last4 = Avons | first4 = S. E. | year = 2007 | title = Reversing picture superiority effect: a speed-accuracy trade-off study of recognition memory | url = | journal = Memory &amp; Cognition | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 113–123 | doi = 10.3758/BF03195948 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, equivalent response time was reported for pictures and words for intelligence comparison (Paivio &amp; Marschark, 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paivio|first=Allan|last2=Marschark|first2=Marc|date=1980|title=Comparative judgements of animal intelligence and pleasantness|url=|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|doi=10.3758/BF03197550|volume=8|pages=39–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Contrary to the assumption that pictures have faster access to the same semantic code than words do; all semantic information is stored in a single system. The only difference is that pictures and words access different features of the semantic code (te Linde, 1982&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=te Linde|first=John|date=1982|title=Picture-word difference in decision latency: A test of common-coding assumptions|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.8.6.584|pmid=|access-date=|volume=8|pages=584–598}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==With age==

Across the lifespan, a gradual development of the picture superiority effect is evident. Some studies have shown that it appears to become more pronounced with age,&lt;ref name="defeyter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whitehouse"/&gt; while others have found that this effect is also observed among younger children (Whitehouse, Mayber, Durkin, 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitehouse|first=Andrew JO|last2=Maybery|first2=Murray T|last3=Durkin|first3=Kevin|date=2006|title=The development of the picture-superiority effect|url=|journal=British Journal of Developmental Psychology|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). However, the major contribution in picture superiority in recognition memory among children was familiarity (Defeyter, Russo &amp; McPartlin, 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Defeater|first=Margaret A|last2=Russo|first2=Riccardo|last3=McPartlin|first3=Pamela|date=2009|title=The Picture Superiority Effect in Recognition Memory: a developmental study|url=|journal=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). During childhood, specifically among seven-year-olds, the picture superiority effect is lesser in magnitude than in other age groups.&lt;ref name="whitehouse"/&gt; This could be due to the lack of inner speech among younger children supporting the [[Dual-coding theory|dual coding theory]] of Paivio. In healthy older adults, the picture superiority effect was found to be greater than it was for younger adults, in comparison to recognition for words, which was disadvantaged for older adults.&lt;ref name="allywaring"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ally | first1 = B. A. | last2 = Waring | first2 = J. D. | last3 = Beth | first3 = E. H. | last4 = McKeever | first4 = J. D. | last5 = Milberg | first5 = W. P. | last6 = Budson | first6 = A. E. | year = 2008 | title = Aging memory for pictures: using high-density event-related potentials to understand the effect of aging on the picture superiority effect | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 679–689 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.09.011 | pmc = 2271145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that regard, seniors can benefit from using pictorial information to retain textual information (Cherry et al., 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cherry|first=Katie E|last2=Hawley|first2=Karri S|last3=Jackson|first3=Erin M|last4=Julia|first4=Volaufova|last5=Su|first5=Joseph|last6=Jazwinski|first6=Michal|date=2008|title=Pictorial superiority effects in oldest-old people|url=|journal=Memory|doi=10.1080/09658210802215534|volume=16|pages=728–741|pmc=2575043}}&lt;/ref&gt;). While memory for words is impaired for older adults, pictures help restore their impaired memory and function properly (Ally et al., 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ally|first=Brandon|last2=Warning|first2=Jill D|last3=Beth|first3=Ellen H|last4=McKeever|first4=Joshua|last5=Milberg|first5=William P|last6=Budson|first6=Andrew E|date=2008|title=Acing memory for pictures: Using high-density potentials to understand the effect of aging on the picture superiority effect|url=|journal=Neuropsychologia|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.09.011|volume=46|issue=2|pages=679–689|pmc=2271145}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In addition, older adults have shown the same level of capability for identifying correct items in comparison with young adults when items were accompanied with pictures (Smith, Hunt &amp; Dunlap, 2015). In populations with Alzheimer's disease, and other mild cognitive impairments, the picture superiority effect remains evident.&lt;ref name="allymckeever"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ally | first1 = B. A. | last2 = McKeever | first2 = J. D. | last3 = Waring | first3 = J. D. | last4 = Budson | first4 = A.

== Applications ==

* '''Education (language learning)''': Learners can structure a mental model when processing a picture initially so that no further model construction may be required for subsequent processing of a text. Presenting picture before text is beneficial to students with low prior knowledge (Eitel &amp; Scheiter, 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eitel|first=Alexander|last2=Scheiter|first2=Katharina|date=2015|title=Picture or text first? Explaining sequence effects when learning with pictures and text|url=|journal=Educational Psychology Review|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In a similar vein, reading a picture prior to processing textual information improves comprehension levels for students with low prior knowledge (Salmerón, Baccino, Cañas, Madrid, &amp; Fajardo, 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salmerón|first=Ladislao|last2=Baccino|first2=Thierry|last3=Cañas|first3=Jose J|last4=Madrid|first4=Rafael I|last5=Fajardo|first5=Inmaculada|date=2009|title=Do graphical overviews facilitate or hinder comprehension in hyptertext?|url=|journal=Computers &amp; Education|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2009.06.013|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Pictures can be more effective than word translation for language learning when individuals are not overconfident in the mnemonic power of pictures{{Vague|date=July 2016}} (Carpenter &amp; Olson, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=Shana K|last2=Olson|first2=Kellie M|date=2012|title=Are pictures good for learning new vocabulary in a foreign language? Only if you think they are not.|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|doi=10.1037/a0024828|pmid=|access-date=|volume=38|pages=92–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;). If they are overconfident, pictures lose superiority over words.

* '''Health communication''': A study by Ally, Gold and Budson (2009)&lt;ref name="ally gold" /&gt; confirm that picture superiority effect was observed among mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amnestic-type mild cognitive impairment (MC). Pictures have a significantly positive effect on four areas of communication: attention, comprehension, recall, and intention/adherence. Health education materials can benefit greatly by adding pictures as pictures can be especially beneficial for people who lack literacy skill (Houts, C.Doak, L.Doak &amp;Loscalzo, 2006&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houts|first=Peter S|last2=Doak|first2=Cecilia C|last3=Doak|first3=Leonard G|last4=Loscalzo|first4=Matthew J|date=2006|title=The role of pictures in improving health communication: a review of research on attention, comprehension, recall, and adherence|url=|journal=Patient education and counseling|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Picture superiority effect can be implemented in creating materials for health communication that inclusion of fearful or disgusting images led to improved recognition memory in comparison with the condition without a presence of image (Leshner, Vultee, Bolls &amp; Moore, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leshner|first=Glenn|last2=Volte|first2=Fred|last3=Bolls|first3=Paul D|last4=Moore|first4=Jensen|date=2010|title=When a fear appeal isn't just a fear appeal: The effects of graphic anti-tobacco messages|url=|journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|doi=10.1080/08838151.2010.498850|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
*'''Advertising''': Percy and Rossiter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A theory-based approach to pretesting advertising|last=Percy|first=Larry|last2=Rossiter|first2=John R|publisher=WD Wells|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1997, p.&amp;nbsp;295) stated, "The picture is the most important structural element in magazine advertising, for both consumer and business audiences." Visually framed messages were more effective under the condition where the audience was less motivated and had less ability to process information semantically. Visual ads require less exposure than verbal ads for long-term memory effect (Childers &amp; Houston, 1984&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;).  The pictorial component in the ad is more likely to be viewed before words, and it generates an expectation for the verbal component of the ad (Houston, Childers &amp; Heckler, 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houston|first=Michael J|last2=Childers|first2=Terry L|last3=Heckler|first3=Susan E|date=1987|title=Picture-word consistency and the elaborative processing of advertisements|url=|journal=Journal of Marketing Research|doi=10.2307/3151383|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Maximizing the size of pictures regardless of advertising contents will improve attention to the entire advertisement as pictures draw significant attention to baseline in the ads (Pieters &amp; Wedel, 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pieters|first=Rik|last2=Wedel|first2=Michel|author2-link= Michel Wedel |date=2004|title=Attention capture and transfer in advertising: Brand, pictorial, and text-seize effects|url=|journal=Journal of Marketing|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Positive [[charge (physics)|charges]] in [[ions]] are achieved by stripping away [[electrons]] orbiting the atomic nuclei, where the total number of electrons removed is related to either increasing temperature or the local density of other ionised matter. This also can be accompanied by the dissociation of [[molecular bond]]s,&lt;ref name="Sturrock" /&gt; though this process is distinctly different from [[Chemistry|chemical processes]] of [[Metal ions in aqueous solution|ion interactions in liquids]] or the behaviour of shared ions in [[metal]]s. The response of plasma to electromagnetic fields is used in many modern technological devices, such as [[plasma display|plasma televisions]] or [[plasma etching]].&lt;ref name=Itptma2013&gt;{{cite book

==History==

The word ''plasma'' comes {{ety|grc|''πλάσμα''&amp;#8203;|moldable substance}}&lt;ref name="πλάσμα"/&gt; or 'jelly',&lt;ref name=Itpp1995&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goldston |first1=R.J. |last2=Rutherford |first2=P.H. |date=1995 |title=Introduction to Plasma Physics |page=1−2 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-7503-0183-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7kM7yEFUGnAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=chen+%22introduction+to+plasma+physics%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and describes the behaviour of the Ionised atomic nuclei and the electrons within the surrounding region of the plasma. Very simply, each of these nuclei are suspended in a movable sea of electrons. Plasma was first identified in a [[Crookes tube]], and so described by [[Sir William Crookes]] in 1879 (he called it "radiant matter").&lt;ref&gt;Crookes presented a [[lecture]] to the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], in Sheffield, on Friday, 22 August 1879 {{cite web |url=http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/5dcb9349d366f8ec.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709162459/http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/5dcb9349d366f8ec.html |archivedate=9 July 2006 |df=dmy-all }} {{cite web |url=http://www.tfcbooks.com/mall/more/315rm.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613212651/http://tfcbooks.com/mall/more/315rm.htm |archivedate=13 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of this "[[cathode ray]]" matter was subsequently identified by British physicist [[J. J. Thomson|Sir J.J.

Langmuir described the plasma he observed as follows:
:"''Except near the electrodes, where there are ''sheaths'' containing very few electrons, the ionised gas contains ions and electrons in about equal numbers so that the resultant space charge is very small. We shall use the name ''plasma'' to describe this region containing balanced charges of ions and electrons.''"&lt;ref name="langmuir1928" /&gt;

===Definition===

Plasma is a [[state of matter]] in which an ionised gaseous substance becomes highly [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrically conductive]] to the point that long-range [[electromagnetism|electric and magnetic fields]] dominate the behaviour of the matter.&lt;ref name="Chen, Francis F. 2016 2–3"&gt;{{cite book | title=Introduction to Plasma Physics and controlled fusion | author=Chen, Francis F. | year=1984 | publisher=Springer International Publishing | url=https://books.google.com/?id=WGbaBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:9PGss7GnX-MC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | pages=2–3 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115215631/https://books.google.com/books?id=WGbaBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:9PGss7GnX-MC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimuOfm_pXXAhVrzFQKHTrOCaUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | archivedate=15 January 2018 | df=dmy-all | isbn=9781475755954 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freidberg, Jeffrey P. 2008 121"&gt;{{cite book | title=Plasma Physics and Fusion Energy | author=Freidberg, Jeffrey P. | year=2008 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vyoe88GEVz4C | page=121 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224204205/https://books.google.com/books?id=Vyoe88GEVz4C | archivedate=24 December 2016 | df=dmy-all | isbn=9781139462150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plasma state can be contrasted with the [[State of matter#The four fundamental states|other states]]: [[solid]], [[liquid]], and [[gas]].

Plasma is an electrically neutral medium of unbound positive and negative particles (i.e. the overall charge of a plasma is roughly zero). Although these particles are unbound, they are not "free" in the sense of not experiencing forces. Moving charged particles generate an electric current within a magnetic field, and any movement of a charged plasma particle affects and is affected by the fields created by the other charges. In turn this governs collective behaviour with many degrees of variation.&lt;ref name="Sturrock"&gt;{{cite book |title=Plasma Physics: An Introduction to the Theory of Astrophysical, Geophysical &amp; Laboratory Plasmas |last=Sturrock |first=Peter A. |date=1994 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-44810-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Framework of Plasma Physics |author=Hazeltine, R.D. |author2=Waelbroeck, F.L. |date=2004 |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=978-0-7382-0047-7}}

===Temperature===
Plasma temperature is commonly measured in [[kelvins]] or [[electronvolt]]s and is, informally, a measure of the thermal kinetic energy per particle. High temperatures are usually needed to sustain ionisation, which is a defining feature of a plasma. The degree of plasma ionisation is determined by the [[electron temperature]] relative to the [[ionization energy]] (and more weakly by the density), in a relationship called the [[Saha equation]]. At low temperatures, ions and electrons tend to recombine into bound states—atoms&lt;ref name="Nicholson"&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Plasma Theory |last=Nicholson |first= Dwight R. |date=1983 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-09045-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and the plasma will eventually become a gas.

In most cases the electrons are close enough to [[thermal equilibrium]] that their temperature is relatively well-defined, even when there is a significant deviation from a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]] energy [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]], for example, due to [[UV radiation]], energetic particles, or strong [[electric fields]]. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionised technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the [[ambient temperature]].

====Fully vs. partially (weakly) ionized gases====
{{main|Degree of ionization}}
{{see also|Spitzer resistivity}}
For plasma to exist, [[ionization|ionisation]] is necessary. The term "plasma density" by itself usually refers to the "electron density", that is, the number of free electrons per unit volume. The [[degree of ionization|degree of ionisation]] of a plasma is the proportion of atoms that have lost or gained electrons, and is controlled by the electron and ion temperatures and electron-ion vs electron-neutral collision frequencies. The degree of ionisation, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{n_i}{n_i + n_n}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number density of ions and &lt;math&gt;n_n&lt;/math&gt; is the number density of neutral atoms. The ''electron density'' is related to this by the average charge state{{Explain|date=August 2018}} &lt;math&gt;\langle Z\rangle&lt;/math&gt; of the ions through &lt;math&gt;n_e = \langle Z\rangle n_i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt; is the number density of electrons.

In a plasma, the electron-ion collision frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu_{ei}&lt;/math&gt; is much greater than the electron-neutral collision frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu_{en}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, with a weak degree of ionization &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the electron-ion collision frequency can equal the electron-neutral collision frequency: &lt;math&gt;\nu_{ei} = \nu_{en}&lt;/math&gt; is the limit separating a plasma from being partially or fully ionized.

* The term ''fully ionized gas'' introduced by [[Lyman Spitzer]] does not mean the degree of ionization is unity, but only that the plasma is in a ''Coulomb-collision dominated regime'', i.e. when &lt;math&gt;\nu_{ei} &gt; \nu_{en}&lt;/math&gt;, which can correspond to a degree of ionization as low as 0.01%.&lt;ref name="Chapman 1980"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chapman |first=Brian |date=25 September 1980 |title=Glow Discharge Processes: Sputtering and Plasma Etching |url=https://fr.scribd.com/document/150525600/Brian-Chapman-Glow-Discharge-Processes |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=49 |chapter=Chapter 3: Plasmas |isbn=978-0471078289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A ''partially'' or ''weakly ionized gas'' means the plasma is not dominated by [[Coulomb collision]]s, i.e. when &lt;math&gt;\nu_{ei} &lt; \nu_{en}&lt;/math&gt;.

Most of "technological" (engineered) plasmas are weakly ionized gases.

====Thermal vs. nonthermal (cold) plasmas====
{{main|Nonthermal plasma}}
{{see also|Anisothermal plasma}}
Based on the relative temperatures of the electrons, ions and neutrals, plasmas are classified as "thermal" or "non-thermal" (also referred to as "cold plasmas"). 

* ''Thermal plasmas'' have electrons and the heavy particles at the same temperature, i.e. they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. 

* ''Nonthermal plasmas'' on the other hand are non-equilibrium ionized gases, with two temperatures: ions and neutrals stay at a low temperature (sometimes [[room temperature]]), whereas electrons are much hotter. (&lt;math&gt;T_e \gg T_n&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;von Engel, A. and Cozens, J.R. (1976) "Flame Plasma" in ''Advances in electronics and electron physics'', L. L. Marton (ed.), Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-0-12-014520-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0Mndi2cCMuUC&amp;lpg=PA99 p. 99] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202013244/https://books.google.com/books?id=0Mndi2cCMuUC&amp;lpg=PA99 |date=2 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A kind of common nonthermal plasma is the [[Mercury-vapor lamp|mercury-vapor gas]] within a [[fluorescent lamp]], where the "electrons gas" reaches a temperature of 10,000 kelvins while the rest of the gas stays barely above room temperature, so the [[Electric light|bulb]] can even be touched with hands while operating.

A particular and unusual case of "inverse" nonthermal plasma is the very high temperature plasma produced by the [[Z Pulsed Power Facility|Z machine]], where ions are much hotter than electrons.&lt;ref name="haines_a"&gt;{{cite journal

===Plasma potential===
[[File:Bliksem in Assen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|[[Lightning]] as an example of plasma present at Earth's surface:
Typically, lightning discharges 30 kiloamperes at up to 100 megavolts, and emits radio waves, light, X- and even gamma rays.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/rhessi_tgf.html Flashes in the Sky: Earth's Gamma-Ray Bursts Triggered by Lightning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707164546/http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/rhessi_tgf.html |date=7 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasma temperatures can approach 30000 K and electron densities may exceed 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.]]
Since plasmas are very good [[electrical conductor]]s, electric potentials play an important role.{{clarify|what role?|date=October 2017}} The average potential in the space between charged particles, independent of how it can be measured, is called the "plasma potential", or the "space potential". If an electrode is inserted into a plasma, its potential will generally lie considerably below the plasma potential due to what is termed a [[Debye sheath]]. The good electrical conductivity of plasmas makes their electric fields very small. This results in the important concept of "quasineutrality", which says the density of negative charges is approximately equal to the density of positive charges over large volumes of the plasma (&lt;math&gt;n_e = \langle Z\rangle n_i&lt;/math&gt;), but on the scale of the [[Debye length]] there can be charge imbalance. In the special case that ''[[Double layer (plasma)|double layers]]'' are formed, the charge separation can extend some tens of Debye lengths.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The magnitude of the potentials and electric fields must be determined by means other than simply finding the net [[charge density]]. A common example is to assume that the electrons satisfy the [[Boltzmann relation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;n_e \propto e^{e\Phi/k_BT_e}.&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating this relation provides a means to calculate the electric field from the density:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{E} = (k_BT_e/e)(\nabla n_e/n_e).&lt;/math&gt;

It is possible to produce a plasma that is not quasineutral. An electron beam, for example, has only negative charges. The density of a non-neutral plasma must generally be very low, or it must be very small, otherwise, it will be dissipated by the repulsive [[electrostatic force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42854229|title=Plasma science : from fundamental research to technological applications|last=|first=|date=1995|publisher=National Academy Press|others=National Research Council (U.S.). Panel on Opportunities in Plasma Science and Technology.|year=|isbn=9780309052313|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=51|oclc=42854229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[astrophysical]] plasmas, [[electric field screening|Debye screening]] prevents [[electric field]]s from directly affecting the plasma over large distances, i.e., greater than the [[Debye length]]. However, the existence of charged particles causes the plasma to generate, and be affected by, [[magnetic field]]s. This can and does cause extremely complex behaviour, such as the generation of plasma double layers, an object that separates charge over a few tens of [[Debye length]]s. The dynamics of plasmas interacting with external and self-generated [[magnetic field]]s are studied in the [[academic discipline]] of [[magnetohydrodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dorch |first=Søren |date=2007-04-13 |title=Magnetohydrodynamics |url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Magnetohydrodynamics |journal=Scholarpedia |language=en |volume=2 |issue=4|pages=2295 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.2295 |issn=1941-6016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402043642/http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Magnetohydrodynamics |archivedate=2 April 2008 |df=dmy-all |bibcode=2007SchpJ...2.2295D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetization===
Plasma with a magnetic field strong enough to influence the motion of the charged particles is said to be magnetized. A common quantitative criterion is that a particle on average completes at least one gyration around the magnetic field before making a collision, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\mathrm{ce}} / v_{\mathrm{coll}} &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\mathrm{ce}}&lt;/math&gt; is the "electron gyrofrequency" and &lt;math&gt;v_{\mathrm{coll}}&lt;/math&gt; is the "electron collision rate". It is often the case that the electrons are magnetized while the ions are not. Magnetized plasmas are ''[[anisotropic]]'', meaning that their properties in the direction parallel to the magnetic field are different from those perpendicular to it. While electric fields in plasmas are usually small due to the high conductivity, the electric field associated with a plasma moving in a magnetic field is given by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} = -v\times\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; is the electric field, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic field), and is not affected by [[Debye shielding]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Fitzpatrick, ''Introduction to Plasma Physics'', [http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/lectures/node10.html Magnetized plasmas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301073703/http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/lectures/node10.html |date=1 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of plasma and gas phases===
Plasma is often called the ''fourth state of matter'' after solid, liquids and gases, despite plasma typically being an ionised gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Although it is closely related to the gas phase in that it also has no definite form or volume, it differs in a number of ways, including the following:

{| class="wikitable"
|-

! [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|Electrical conductivity]]
| '''Very low''': Air is an excellent insulator until it breaks down into plasma at electric field strengths above 30 kilovolts per centimeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| '''Usually very high''': For many purposes, the conductivity of a plasma may be treated as infinite.
|-
! Independently acting species
| '''One''': All gas particles behave in a similar way, influenced by [[gravity]] and by [[collision]]s with one another.
| '''Two or three''': [[Electron]]s, [[ion]]s, [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s can be distinguished by the sign and value of their [[electric charge|charge]] so that they behave independently in many circumstances, with different bulk velocities and temperatures, allowing phenomena such as new types of [[waves in plasma|waves]] and [[Instability|instabilities]].
|-
! Velocity distribution
| '''[[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]]''': Collisions usually lead to a Maxwellian velocity distribution of all gas particles, with very few relatively fast particles.
| '''Often non-Maxwellian''': Collisional interactions are often weak in hot plasmas and external forcing can drive the plasma far from local equilibrium and lead to a significant population of unusually fast particles.
|-
! Interactions
| '''Binary''': Two-particle collisions are the rule, three-body collisions extremely rare.
| '''Collective''': Waves, or organized motion of plasma, are very important because the particles can interact at long ranges through the electric and magnetic forces.

==Complex plasma phenomena==

Although the underlying equations governing plasmas are relatively simple, plasma behaviour is extraordinarily varied and subtle: the emergence of unexpected behaviour from a simple model is a typical feature of a [[complex system]]. Such systems lie in some sense on the boundary between ordered and disordered behaviour and cannot typically be described either by simple, smooth, mathematical functions, or by pure randomness. The spontaneous formation of interesting spatial features on a wide range of length scales is one manifestation of plasma complexity. The features are interesting, for example, because they are very sharp, spatially intermittent (the distance between features is much larger than the features themselves), or have a [[fractal]] form. Many of these features were first studied in the laboratory, and have subsequently been recognized throughout the universe. Examples of complexity and complex structures in plasmas include:

===Filamentation===

Filamentation also refers to the self-focusing of a high power laser pulse. At high powers, the nonlinear part of the index of refraction becomes important and causes a higher index of refraction in the center of the laser beam, where the laser is brighter than at the edges, causing a feedback that focuses the laser even more. The tighter focused laser has a higher peak brightness (irradiance) that forms a plasma. The plasma has an index of refraction lower than one, and causes a defocusing of the laser beam. The interplay of the focusing index of refraction, and the defocusing plasma makes the formation of a long filament of plasma that can be [[micrometer (unit)|micrometers]] to kilometers in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Chin, S.

===Non-neutral plasma===
The strength and range of the electric force and the good conductivity of plasmas usually ensure that the densities of positive and negative charges in any sizeable region are equal ("quasineutrality"). A plasma with a significant excess of charge density, or, in the extreme case, is composed of a single species, is called a [[Non-neutral plasmas|non-neutral plasma]]. In such a plasma, electric fields play a dominant role. Examples are charged [[particle beam]]s, an electron cloud in a [[Penning trap]] and positron plasmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Greaves | first1 = R. G. | last2 = Tinkle | first2 = M.

===Dusty plasma/grain plasma===
A [[dusty plasma]] contains tiny charged particles of dust (typically found in space). The dust particles acquire high charges and interact with each other. A plasma that contains larger particles is called grain plasma. Under laboratory conditions, dusty plasmas are also called ''complex plasmas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morfill |first=G. E. |title= Complex plasmas: An interdisciplinary research field |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=81 |date=2009 |pages=1353–1404 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.81.1353|bibcode = 2009RvMP...81.1353M |first2=Alexei V. |last2=Ivlev |issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impermeable plasma===
Impermeable plasma is a type of thermal plasma which acts like an impermeable solid with respect to gas or cold plasma and can be physically pushed. Interaction of cold gas and thermal plasma was briefly studied by a group led by [[Hannes Alfvén]] in 1960s and 1970s for its possible applications in insulation of [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] plasma from the reactor walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alfvén |first1=H. |last2=Smårs |first2=E.|title= Gas-Insulation of a Hot Plasma |journal=Nature |volume=188 |date=1960 |pages=801–802 |doi=10.1038/188801a0|bibcode = 1960Natur.188..801A |issue=4753 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later it was found that the external [[magnetic fields]] in this configuration could induce [[Kink instability|kink instabilities]] in the plasma and subsequently lead to an unexpectedly high heat loss to the walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Braams |first1=C.M. |title= Stability of Plasma Confined by a Cold-Gas Blanket |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=17 |issue=9 |date=1966 |pages=470–471 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.17.470|bibcode = 1966PhRvL..17..470B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2013, a group of materials scientists reported that they have successfully generated stable impermeable plasma with no [[magnetic confinement]] using only an ultrahigh-pressure blanket of cold gas. While spectroscopic data on the characteristics of plasma were claimed to be difficult to obtain due to the high pressure, the passive effect of plasma on [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of different [[nanostructures]] clearly suggested the effective confinement. They also showed that upon maintaining the impermeability for a few tens of seconds, screening of [[ions]] at the plasma-gas interface could give rise to a strong secondary mode of heating (known as viscous heating) leading to different kinetics of reactions and formation of complex [[nanomaterials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yaghoubi |first1=A. |last2=Mélinon |first2=P.|title= Tunable synthesis and in situ growth of silicon-carbon mesostructures using impermeable plasma |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=3 |pages=1083 |date=2013 |doi=10.1038/srep01083|bibcode = 2013NatSR...3E1083Y |pmid=23330064 |pmc=3547321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Plasma modeling}}
To completely describe the state of a plasma, all of the
particle locations and velocities that describe the electromagnetic field in the plasma region would need to be written down.
However, it is generally not practical or necessary to keep track of all the particles in a plasma.
Therefore, plasma physicists commonly use less detailed descriptions, of which
there are two main types:

===Fluid model===
Fluid models describe plasmas in terms of smoothed quantities, like density and averaged velocity around each position (see [[Plasma parameters]]). One simple fluid model, [[magnetohydrodynamics]], treats the plasma as a single fluid governed by a combination of [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Navier–Stokes equations]]. A more general description is the [[two-fluid plasma]] picture, where the ions and electrons are described separately. Fluid models are often accurate when collisionality is sufficiently high to keep the plasma velocity distribution close to a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]. Because fluid models usually describe the plasma in terms of a single flow at a certain temperature at each spatial location, they can neither capture velocity space structures like beams or [[Double layer (plasma)|double layer]]s, nor resolve wave-particle effects.

===Kinetic model===
Kinetic models describe the particle velocity distribution function at each point in the plasma and therefore do not need to assume a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]. A kinetic description is often necessary for collisionless plasmas. There are two common approaches to kinetic description of a plasma. One is based on representing the smoothed distribution function on a grid in velocity and position. The other, known as the [[particle-in-cell]] (PIC) technique, includes kinetic information by following the trajectories of a large number of individual particles. Kinetic models are generally more computationally intensive than fluid models. The [[Vlasov equation]] may be used to describe the dynamics of a system of charged particles interacting with an electromagnetic field.
In magnetized plasmas, a [[gyrokinetics|gyrokinetic]] approach can substantially reduce the computational expense of a fully kinetic simulation.

==Artificial plasmas==
Most artificial plasmas are generated by the application of electric and/or magnetic fields through a gas. Plasma generated in a laboratory setting and for industrial use can be generally categorized by:
*The type of power source used to generate the plasma—DC, AC (typically with [[radio frequency]] ([[RF]])) and microwave
*The pressure they operate at—vacuum pressure (&lt; 10&amp;nbsp;mTorr or 1 Pa), moderate pressure (≈1&amp;nbsp;Torr or 100 Pa), atmospheric pressure (760&amp;nbsp;Torr or 100 kPa)
*The degree of ionisation within the plasma—fully, partially, or weakly ionised

===Generation of artificial plasma===
[[File:Simple representation of a discharge tube - plasma.png|thumb]]
[[File:Plasma jacobs ladder.jpg|thumb|alt=Artificial plasma produced in air by a Jacob's Ladder|Artificial plasma produced in air by a [[Spark gap#Visual entertainment|Jacob's Ladder]]]]
Just like the many uses of plasma, there are several means for its generation, however, one principle is common to all of them: there must be energy input to produce and sustain it.&lt;ref name="Hippler" /&gt; For this case, plasma is generated when an [[electric current]] is applied across a [[dielectric gas]] or fluid (an electrically [[Electrical conductor|non-conducting]] material) as can be seen in the adjacent image, which shows a [[discharge tube]] as a simple example ([[direct current|DC]] used for simplicity).

The [[potential difference]] and subsequent [[electric field]] pull the bound electrons (negative) toward the [[anode]] (positive electrode) while the [[cathode]] (negative electrode) pulls the nucleus.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite book |title=Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion |last=Chen |first=Francis F. |date=1984 |publisher=Plenum Press |isbn=978-0-306-41332-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WGbaBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:9PGss7GnX-MC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115215631/https://books.google.com/books?id=WGbaBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:9PGss7GnX-MC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimuOfm_pXXAhVrzFQKHTrOCaUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=15 January 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[voltage]] increases, the current stresses the material (by [[electric polarization]]) beyond its [[dielectric strength|dielectric limit]] (termed strength) into a stage of [[electrical breakdown]], marked by an [[electric spark]], where the material transforms from being an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] into a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] (as it becomes increasingly [[ionized|ionised]]). The underlying process is the [[Townsend avalanche]], where collisions between electrons and neutral gas atoms create more ions and electrons (as can be seen in the figure on the right). The first impact of an electron on an atom results in one ion and two electrons. Therefore, the number of charged particles increases rapidly (in the millions) only "after about 20 successive sets of collisions",&lt;ref name="Leal-Quiros" /&gt; mainly due to a small mean free path (average distance travelled between collisions).

====Electric arc====
[[File:Cascade-process-of-ionization.svg|thumb|Cascade process of ionisation. Electrons are "e−", neutral atoms "o", and cations "+".|left]]
[[File:Townsend Discharge.svg|thumbnail|300px|Avalanche effect between two electrodes. The original ionisation event liberates one electron, and each subsequent collision liberates a further electron, so two electrons emerge from each collision: the ionising electron and the liberated electron.]]
With ample current density and ionisation, this forms a luminous [[electric arc]] (a continuous electric discharge similar to [[lightning]]) between the electrodes.{{#tag:ref|The material undergoes various "regimes" or stages (e.g. saturation, breakdown, glow, transition and thermal arc) as the voltage is increased under the voltage-current relationship. The voltage rises to its maximum value in the saturation stage, and thereafter it undergoes fluctuations of the various stages; while the current progressively increases throughout.&lt;ref name="Leal-Quiros"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leal-Quirós, Edbertho |date=2004 |title=Plasma Processing of Municipal Solid Waste |journal= Brazilian Journal of Physics |volume=34 |issue=4B |pages=1587–1593 |bibcode = 2004BrJPh..34.1587L |doi=10.1590/S0103-97332004000800015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}} [[Electrical resistance]] along the continuous electric arc creates [[heat]], which dissociates more gas molecules and ionises the resulting atoms (where degree of ionisation is determined by temperature), and as per the sequence: [[solid]]-[[liquid]]-[[gas]]-plasma, the gas is gradually turned into a thermal plasma.{{#tag:ref|Across literature, there appears to be no strict definition on where the boundary is between a gas and plasma. Nevertheless, it is enough to say that at 2,000°C the gas molecules become atomized, and ionised at 3,000 °C and "in this state, [the] gas has a liquid like viscosity at atmospheric pressure and the free electric charges confer relatively high electrical conductivities that can approach those of metals."&lt;ref name="Gomez" /&gt;|group="Note"}} A thermal plasma is in [[thermal equilibrium]], which is to say that the temperature is relatively homogeneous throughout the heavy particles (i.e. atoms, molecules and ions) and electrons. This is so because when thermal plasmas are generated, [[electrical energy]] is given to electrons, which, due to their great mobility and large numbers, are able to disperse it rapidly and by [[elastic collision]] (without energy loss) to the heavy particles.&lt;ref name="Gomez" /&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Note that non-thermal, or non-equilibrium plasmas are not as ionised and have lower energy densities, and thus the temperature is not dispersed evenly among the particles, where some heavy ones remain "cold".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of industrial/commercial plasma===
Because of their sizable temperature and density ranges, plasmas find applications in many fields of research, technology and industry. For example, in: industrial and extractive [[metallurgy]],&lt;ref name="Gomez"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gomez | first1 = E. | last2 = Rani | first2 = D. A. | last3 = Cheeseman | first3 = C.

====Low-pressure discharges====
*''[[Glow discharge]] plasmas'': non-thermal plasmas generated by the application of DC or low frequency RF (&lt;100&amp;nbsp;kHz) electric field to the gap between two metal electrodes. Probably the most common plasma; this is the type of plasma generated within [[fluorescent light]] tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wfluor.html |title=The Fluorescent Lamp: A plasma you can use |author=Stern, David P. |accessdate=2010-05-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530165958/http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wfluor.html |archivedate=30 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Capacitively coupled plasma]] (CCP)'': similar to glow discharge plasmas, but generated with high frequency RF electric fields, typically [[ISM band|13.56&amp;nbsp;MHz]]. These differ from glow discharges in that the sheaths are much less intense. These are widely used in the microfabrication and integrated circuit manufacturing industries for plasma etching and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sobolewski |first1=M.A. |last2=Langan &amp; Felker |first2=J.G. &amp; B.S. |date=1997 |title=Electrical optimization of plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition chamber cleaning plasmas |journal=Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=173–182 |url=http://physics.nist.gov/MajResProj/rfcell/Publications/MAS_JVSTB16_1.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118212957/http://www.physics.nist.gov/MajResProj/rfcell/Publications/MAS_JVSTB16_1.pdf | archivedate=18 January 2009 |doi=10.1116/1.589774|bibcode = 1998JVSTB..16..173S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Atmospheric pressure====
*''[[Arc discharge]]:'' this is a high power thermal discharge of very high temperature (≈10,000 K). It can be generated using various power supplies. It is commonly used in [[Metallurgy|metallurgical]] processes. For example, it is used to smelt minerals containing Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to produce [[aluminium]].
*''[[Corona discharge]]:'' this is a non-thermal discharge generated by the application of high voltage to sharp electrode tips. It is commonly used in [[ozone]] generators and particle precipitators.
*''[[Dielectric barrier discharge]] (DBD):'' this is a non-thermal discharge generated by the application of high voltages across small gaps wherein a non-conducting coating prevents the transition of the plasma discharge into an arc. It is often mislabeled 'Corona' discharge in industry and has similar application to corona discharges. It is also widely used in the web treatment of fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Leroux | first1 = F. | last2 = Perwuelz | first2 = A. | last3 = Campagne | first3 = C. | last4 = Behary | first4 = N. | title = Atmospheric air-plasma treatments of polyester textile structures | doi = 10.1163/156856106777657788 | journal = Journal of Adhesion Science and Technology | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 939–957 | year = 2006 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of the discharge to synthetic fabrics and plastics functionalizes the surface and allows for paints, glues and similar materials to adhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

These plasma jets are produced by fast propagating guided ionisation waves known as plasma bullets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2014.02.006|title=Guided ionization waves: Theory and experiments|journal=Physics Reports|volume=540|issue=3|pages=123|year=2014|last1=Lu|first1=X.|last2=Naidis|first2=G.V.|last3=Laroussi|first3=M.|last4=Ostrikov|first4=K.|bibcode=2014PhR...540..123L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*"[[Piezoelectric direct discharge plasma]]:" is a [[nonthermal plasma]] generated at the high-side of a piezoelectric transformer (PT). This generation variant is particularly suited for high efficient and compact devices where a separate high voltage power supply is not desired.

===MHD converters===
{{main|magnetohydrodynamic converter|magnetohydrodynamic generator|magnetohydrodynamic drive}}
{{see also|Electrothermal instability}}
A world effort was triggered in the 1960s to study [[magnetohydrodynamic converter]]s in order to bring [[magnetohydrodynamic generator|MHD power conversion]] to market with commercial power plants of a new kind, converting the [[kinetic energy]] of a high velocity plasma into [[electricity]] with no [[moving parts]] at a high [[efficiency]]. Research was also conducted in the field of supersonic and hypersonic aerodynamics to study plasma interaction with magnetic fields to eventually achieve passive and even active [[Flow control (fluid)|flow control]] around vehicles or projectiles, in order to soften and mitigate [[shock wave]]s, lower thermal transfer and reduce [[Drag (physics)|drag]].

Such ionized gases used in "plasma technology" ("technological" or "engineered" plasmas) are usually ''weakly ionized gases'' in the sense that only a tiny fraction of the gas molecules are ionized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/690642377|title=Plasma scattering of electromagnetic radiation : theory and measurement techniques|last=|first=|date=2011|publisher=Academic Press/Elsevier|others=Froula, Dustin H.|year=|isbn=978-0080952031|edition=1st ed., 2nd|location=Burlington, MA|pages=273|oclc=690642377}}&lt;/ref&gt; These kinds of weakly ionized gases are also nonthermal "cold" plasmas. In the presence of magnetics fields, the study of such magnetized nonthermal weakly ionized gases involves [[Magnetohydrodynamics#Ideal_and_resistive_MHD|resistive magnetohydrodynamics]] with low [[magnetic Reynolds number]], a challenging field of plasma physics where calculations require [[dyadic tensor]]s in a [[n-dimensional space|7-dimensional]] [[phase space]]. When used in combination with a high [[Hall effect|Hall parameter]], a critical value triggers the problematic [[electrothermal instability]] which limited these technological developments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51618">'''Political violence''' is [[violence]] perpetrated by people or [[government]]s to achieve political goals. It can describe violence used by a [[State (polity)|state]] against other states ([[war]]) or against non-state actors (e.g. [[police brutality]], [[counter-insurgency]], [[genocide]]). It can also describe politically-motivated violence by non-state actors against a state (e.g. [[rebellion]], [[rioting]]) or against other non-state actors. Non-action on the part of a government can also be characterized as a form of political violence, such as refusing to alleviate [[famine]] or otherwise denying resources to politically identifiable groups within their territory. 

Due to the imbalances of power between state and non-state actors, political violence often takes the form of [[asynchronous warfare]] where neither side is able to directly assault the other, instead relying on tactics such as [[terrorism]] and [[guerrilla warfare]], and often include attacks on [[civilian]] or otherwise [[non-combatant]] targets that are perceived as a proxy for the opposing faction.

Many groups and individuals believe that their political systems will never respond to their demands and thus believe that violence is not only justified but also necessary in order to achieve their political objectives. Similarly, many governments around the world believe they need to use violence in order to intimidate their populace into acquiescence. At other times, governments use force in order to defend their country from outside invasion or other threats of force and to coerce other governments or conquer territory.&lt;ref name="Nelson Education"&gt;[http://polisci.nelson.com/violence.html Definition of "political violence"], Nelson Education; accessed November 5, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Political violence varies widely in form, severity, and practice. In political science, a common organizing framework is to consider types of violence by the relevant actors: violence between non-state actors, one-sided violence perpetrated by a state actor against civilians, and violence between states.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

=== Violence between non-state actors ===
Fighting between non-state actors without state security forces playing a direct role in the conflict.&lt;ref name="hsrgroup.org"&gt;[http://www.hsrgroup.org/docs/Publications/HSR2013/HSRP_Report_2013_140226_Web.pdf Human Security Report Project 2013 Report]; accessed November 5, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ethnic conflict ====
{{Main article|Ethnic conflict}}
{{Expand section|date=May 2016}}
An '''ethnic conflict''' is fought between [[ethnic group]]s. While at times a specific ethnic group may have the backing (whether formal or informal) of the state (or conversely, a specific ethnic group may be targeted by the state), ethnic conflict can also take place between two groups without the direct intervention of the state, or despite the state's attempts to mediate between groups.

=== One-sided violence by non-state actors ===
==== Terrorism ====
{{Main article|Terrorism}}
'''Terrorism''' can be directed by non-state actors against political targets other than the state (e.g. [[Yishai Schlissel|Stabbing attacks at gay pride parades in Jerusalem]], [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]]). Because terrorism is a tactic often used by the weaker side of a conflict, it may also fall under violence between a state and non-state actor.

While there lacks a concrete [[Definitions of terrorism|definition of terrorism]], the [[United States Department of Defense]] however defines terrorism as, "the calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful violence to inculcate fear; intended to coerce or to intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are generally political, religious, or ideological."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrorism-research.com|title=Terrorism Research - What is Terrorism?|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419112023/http://www.terrorism-research.com|archivedate=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is and is not considered terrorism is itself a controversial political question, as states have often used the label of terrorism to exclusively demonize the actions of their enemies while obscuring "legal" violence administered by the state (e.g. [[The Troubles]], [[CPP–NPA–NDF rebellion]], [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Political Terrorism: A New Guide To Actors, Authors, Concepts, Data Bases, Theories, And Literature'' by Albert J. Jongman&lt;!-- publisher, year, page(s), ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== One-sided violence by the state ===
{{further|Mass murder#By states}}
The use of force by an organized armed group, be it a government or non-state group, which results in the deaths of civilians. According to the [[Human Security Report Project]], a campaign of one-sided violence is recorded whenever violence against civilians committed by one group results in at least 25 reported deaths in a calendar year.&lt;ref name="hsrgroup.org"/&gt;

==== Genocide ====
{{Main article|Genocide}}One form of political violence is genocide. '''Genocide''' is commonly defined as "the deliberate and systematic destruction, in whole or in part, of an [[ethnic group|ethnic]], [[Race (classification of humans)|racial]], [[Religious denomination|religious]], or [[nationality|national]] group",&lt;ref&gt;See generally {{cite book |author=Funk, T.

==== Torture ====
{{Main article|Torture}}
Torture is the act of inflicting severe pain (whether physical or psychological) as a means of punishment, revenge, forcing information or confession, or simply as an act of cruelty. Torture is prohibited under [[international law]] and the domestic laws of most countries in the 21st century. It is considered a [[human rights violation]] and is declared unacceptable by Article 5 of the [[UN Declaration of Human Rights]]. Signatories of the [[Third Geneva Convention]] and [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] have officially agreed not to torture prisoners in armed conflicts. National and international legal prohibitions on torture derive from a consensus that torture and similar ill-treatment are immoral, as well as impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/014/2005/en |title=Torture and Ill-Treatment in the 'War on Terror' |date=2005-11-01 |accessdate=2008-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite international conventions, torture cases continue to arise such as the 2004 [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]] scandal committed by military police personnel of the [[United States Army]]. Organizations such as [[Amnesty International]] and the [[International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims]] monitor abuses of human rights and reports widespread violations of human torture in by states in many regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]] [http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engPOL100012005 Report 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050601024732/http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engPOL100012005 |date=2005-06-01 }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20070317170847/http://web.amnesty.org/report2006/2af-summary-eng Report 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International estimates that at least 81 world governments currently practice torture, some of them openly.&lt;ref name="Amnesty08"&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |url=http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/report-08-at-a-glance |title=Report 08: At a Glance |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-10-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080708202906/http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/report-08-at-a-glance |archivedate = July 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Capital punishment ====
{{Main article|Capital punishment}}
Capital punishment is the sentence of death upon a person by the state as a punishment for an offense. This does not include [[extrajudicial killing]], which is the killing of a person by governmental authorities without the sanction of any judicial proceeding or legal process. The [[use of capital punishment by country]] varies, but according to Amnesty International 58 countries still actively use the death penalty, and in 2010, 23 countries carried out executions and 67 imposed death sentences. Methods of execution in 2010 included beheading, electrocution, hanging, lethal injection and shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Death Penalty in 2010|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/death-sentences-and-executions-in-2010|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the United Nations General Assembly passed the [[UN moratorium on the death penalty]] which called for worldwide abolition of the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Death Penalty in International Law|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/international-law|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Police brutality ====
{{Main article|Police brutality}}
Police brutality is another form of political violence. It is most commonly described in juxtaposition with the term excessive force. Police brutality can be defined as "a civil rights violation that occurs when a police officer acts with excessive force by using an amount of force with regards to a civilian that is more than necessary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/police-brutality/|title=Police Brutality Law &amp; Legal Definitions |publisher=uslegal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police brutality and the use of excessive force are present throughout the world and in the United States alone, 4,861 incidences of police misconduct were reported during 2010 (see also [[Police brutality (United States)]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.injusticeeverywhere.com/?p=4053|title=2010 NPMSRP Police Misconduct Statistical Report -Draft- - PoliceMisconduct.net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, there were 6,826 victims involved and 247 fatalities.

==== Famine ====
{{Main article|Famine}}
&lt;!-- Is Bengal famine that occurred during WWII in India an example of famine as violence by state? Various researchers, including Amrtya Sen has shown how British government had diverted resources to war.  --&gt;Famine can be initiated or prolonged in order to deny resources, compel obedience, or to depopulate a region with a recalcitrant or untrusted populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/starvation-is-being-used-as-a-weapon-of-war-in-syria|title=Famine Is Being Used as a Weapon of War in Syria|work=VICE|accessdate=20 April 2016|date=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/10/zimbabwe.famine|title=Famine becomes Mugabe weapon|author=Peter Beaumont|newspaper=the Guardian|accessdate=20 April 2016|date=2002-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theirishstory.com/2012/01/03/war-and-famine-in-ireland-1580-1700/#.VZb94Pmqqko|title=War and Famine in Ireland, 1580-1700|work=The Irish Story|accessdate=20 April 2016|date=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Violence between a state and non-state actor ===
At least one of the warring parties involved is the government of a state.&lt;ref name="hsrgroup.org"/&gt;

==== Rebellion ====
{{Main article|Rebellion}} 
{{Expand section|date=May 2016}}

==== Rioting ====
{{Main article|Riot}} 
A '''riot''' can be described as a violent disturbance by a group of individuals formed to protest perceived wrongs and/or injustice. These can range from poverty and inequality to unemployment and government oppression. They can manifest themselves in a number of ways but most commonly in the form of property damage. [[Riot]]s are characterized by their lack of predictability and the anonymity of their participants. Both make it difficult for authorities to identify those participating.&lt;ref&gt;Wada, George, and James C. Davies. "Riots and Rioters". The Western Political Quarterly 10.4 (1957): 864–874. Web...&lt;/ref&gt;

Riots have been analyzed in a number of ways but most recently in the context of the frustration-aggression model theory, expressing that the aggression seen in most riots is a direct result of a groups frustration with a particular aspect of their lives.Widespread and prolonged rioting can lead to and/or produce rebellion or revolution. There are also a number of different types of riots including but not limited to police riots, [[race riots|race riot]], [[prison riots]], and [[sports riots|sport riot]].

==== Revolution ====
{{Main article|Revolution}}
{{Expand section|date=May 2016}}

==== Civil War ====
{{Main article|Civil war}}
Also known as an intrastate war, a civil war is a war fought within the same state or country between organized groups. Less commonly, it can also be fought between two countries that have been created from one previously unified state. Often these conflicts involve one group wishing to take control of a region or expressing dissatisfaction with the government. There is typically a desire to overthrow the existing power or at least change some of their policies. In many cases, an outside power may intervene on behalf of one side if they share their ideology or condemn the methods/motives of their opponents.

==== Counter-insurgency ====
{{Main article|Counter-insurgency}}
'''Counter-insurgency''', another form of political violence, describes a spectrum of actions taken by the recognized government of a state to contain or quell an [[insurgency]] taken up against it.&lt;ref&gt;An ''insurgency'' is a [[rebellion]] against a constituted authority (for example an authority recognized as such by the [[United Nations]]) when those taking part in the rebellion are not recognized as [[belligerent]]s ([[Oxford English Dictionary]] second edition 1989 "insurgent B. n. One who rises in revolt against constituted authority; a rebel who is not recognized as a belligerent.")&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different doctrines, theories, and tactics espoused regarding counter-insurgency that aim to protect the authority of the government and to reduce or eliminate the supplanting authority of the insurgents. Because it may be difficult or impossible to distinguish between an insurgent, a supporter of an insurgency who is a [[non-combatant]], and entirely uninvolved members of the population, counter-insurgency operations have often rested on a confused, relativistic, or otherwise [[situational]] distinction between insurgents and non-combatants. Counter-insurgency operations are common during [[war]], [[Military occupation|occupation]] and armed [[rebellion]]s.

=== War between states ===
{{Main article|War}}
'''War''' is a state of organized, armed, and often prolonged conflict carried on between [[State (polity)|states]], [[nation]]s, or other parties&lt;ref name=AHD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/War |title=American Heritage Dictionary: War |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MWD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/war |title=Merriam Webster's Dictionary: War |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; typified by extreme aggression, social disruption, and usually high mortality.&lt;ref name=AHD /&gt; War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of political violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/war/ |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been waged in the last century: the death toll of [[World War II]], estimated at more than 60 million, surpasses all other war death tolls by a factor of two. It is estimated that 378,000 people died due to war each year between 1985 and 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Obermeyer Z, Murray CJ, Gakidou E |title=Fifty years of violent war deaths from Vietnam to Bosnia: analysis of data from the world health survey programme |journal=BMJ |volume=336 |issue=7659 |pages=1482–6 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18566045 |pmc=2440905 |doi=10.1136/bmj.a137 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends==
Scholarship and data suggests that violence has declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/05/14/genocide-is-going-out-of-fashion/|title=Genocide is Going Out of Fashion|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?lang=en&amp;id=126956|title=Global Political Violence: Explaining the Post-Cold War Decline|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Winning the War on War: The Decline of Armed Conflict Worldwide|last=Goldstein|first=Joshua|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=978-0452298590|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[World War II]], there has been a decline in battle deaths and since the [[Cold War]], there has been a decline in conflict.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Recently, scholars have started to question this long-held belief.

=== Long-run trends ===
Since [[World War II]], there has been a decline in battle deaths and since the [[Cold War]], there has been a decline in conflict.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Between 1992 and 2005, violent conflict around the world dropped by 40 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, A., 2007, 'Global Political Violence: Explaining the Post-Cold War Decline', Coping with Crisis Working Paper Series, International Peace Academy, New York&lt;/ref&gt; In [[The Better Angels of Our Nature]], [[Steven Pinker]] argues that this decline has not occurred over the past 60 years, but has been going on for over the past millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Better Angels of Our Nature|last=Pinker|first=Steven|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=978-0-670-02295-3|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Datasets on political violence have shown similar trends.

For example, the Center for Systemic Peace finds that in the post-World War II era armed conflict was at its peak when the Soviet Union collapsed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.systemicpeace.org/conflicttrends.html|title=Conflict Trends|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1990s to the early 2000s, the levels of armed conflict declined. Recently, armed conflict has begun to increase as political violence in the Middle East and Africa begins to increase.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]] (UCDP), another project that collects armed conflict data, has found similar trends as well. UCDP defines armed conflict as conflict that involves the government of a state which "results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in one calendar year."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/|title=UCDP Definitions|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their overview of armed conflict, UCDP has found that the number of armed conflicts in the world has decreased since the end of the Cold War, yet, there has been some recent upward trends.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=July 2015|title=Armed conflicts, 1946–2014|url=http://jpr.sagepub.com/content/52/4/536.abstract|journal=Journal of Peace Research|doi=10.1177/0022343315595927|pmid=|access-date=|volume=52|issue=4|pages=536–550|last1=Pettersson|first1=Therése|last2=Wallensteen|first2=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past ten years, the UCDP has found an upward trend in the number of internationalized armed conflicts, "a conflict between a government of a state and internal opposition groups with intervention from other states."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Critique ====
Recently, the conventional wisdom that violent conflict has declined is being challenged. Scholars argue that the current data, focus on the number of battle deaths per country per year, are misleading.

Tanisha Fazal argues that wars have become less fatal because of medical advancements that help keep more people alive during wars. Therefore, the battle death threshold used by the UCDP and other organizations to determine cases of armed conflict is misleading. A conflict "that produced 1,000 battle deaths in 1820 will likely produce many fewer overall casualties (where casualties, properly understood, include the dead and wounded) than a conflict with 1,000 battle deaths today."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/09/04/the-reports-of-wars-demise-have-been-exaggerated/|title=The reports of war's demise have been exaggerated|last=Fazal|first=Tanisha|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current data makes it seem like, war is becoming less frequent, when it is not.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fazal|first=Tanisha|date=Summer 2014|title=Dead Wrong? Battle Deaths, Military Medicine, and Exaggerated Reports of War's Demise|url=|journal=International Security|doi=10.1162/ISEC_a_00166|pmid=|volume=39|pages=95–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bear F. Braumoeller argues that looking at data on per-capita death is a "misleading and irrelevant statistic" because it does not tell us how wars actually happen.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|ssrn=2317269|title=Is War Disappearing?|last=Braumoeller|first=Bear|date=August 27, 2013|website=|publisher=APSA Chicago 2013 Meeting|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decrease in battle-related deaths can mean that population growth is outpacing war deaths or that "fewer people are exposed to risk of death from war".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Instead, we should examine the willingness of a state to go to war. Braumoeller creates a new metric for conflicted called the "use of force", which is the number of militarized dispute that reaches at least a level 4 on the 5-point [[Correlates of War]] Militarized Interstate Dispute scale. He finds that use of force has held steady from the 1800s through the [[World War I|First World War]], but after World War I the use of force has steadily increased. Braumoeller creates another metric called "uses of force per relevant dyad", which is the use of force between neighboring states or states with one major power.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Using this metric he finds that there is no downward trend in the rates of conflict initiation since the post-World War II period. Additionally, he finds that the rates of conflict have remain steady over the past two hundred years and the slight increases and decreases in use of force are random.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Current trends ===

==== Armed conflicts ====
In 2014, UCDP estimates that 126,059 people were killed in organized violence, which is the highest fatality count in the post-Cold War period.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]] had the most violent conflict followed by Iraq and Afghanistan. Additionally, there were 40 armed conflicts active in 27 locations in the world. This is the largest number of conflicts reported since 1999.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Regionally, Asia had the largest amount of violent conflict at 14, followed by Africa at 12, Europe at six, Middle East at six, and the Americas at two.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

During that year, four new conflicts began, all of them in [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|Ukraine]]. Three conflicts were restarted by new actors in &amp;nbsp;Egypt, Lebanon, and Libya. Additionally, six conflicts were restarted by previously registered actors in "[[Armenian–Azerbaijani border conflict|Azerbaijan (Nagorno-Karabakh),]] India ([[Garo Hills|Garoland]]), [[Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts|India–Pakistan]], [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israel (Palestine),]] [[Northern Mali conflict|Mali (Azawad)]], and [[2015 Kokang offensive|Myanmar (Kokang)]]".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Finally, seven conflicts in 2013 were no longer active in 2014. The conflicts were in [[Central African Republic Civil War (2012–present)|Central African Republic]], Ethiopia (Oromiya), Malaysia (Sabah), [[Internal conflict in Myanmar|Myanmar (Karen)]], [[Internal conflict in Myanmar|Myanmar (Shan)]], Mozambique, and [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present)|Turkey (Kurdistan)]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Out of the 40 conflicts, 11 have been classified at the level of war, which means that there were at least 1,000 deaths in one calendar year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The conflict between India and Pakistan was the only interstate conflict, conflict between two or more states. Out of the remaining 39 conflicts, 13 were internationalized, a conflict between a government and internal opposition group where other states intervene. The percentage of internationalized conflict is 33% (13/39), which is the largest proportion of external actors in intrastate conflicts since the post-World War II era.

==== Terrorism ====
Just like armed conflict, there was an increase in fatalities associated with terrorism. In 2014, the [[United States Department of State|United States State Department]] reported 13,463 terrorist attacks in the world.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://csis.org/files/publication/150618_Patterns_in_Global_Terrorism_in_2014.pdf|title=BROAD PATTERNS IN GLOBAL TERRORISM IN 2014|last=Cordesman|first=Anthony|date=June 19, 2015|website=Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attacks resulted in at least 32,700 deaths and 34,700 injuries.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In addition, more than 9,400 people were kidnapped or taken hostage. Compared to 2013, the number of terrorist attacks increased by 35% and the total fatalities increased by 81%.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 2014, the five countries that experienced the most terrorist attacks were Iraq, [[Terrorism in Pakistan|Pakistan]], Afghanistan, [[Terrorism in India|India]], and Nigeria. In 2013, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, and the [[Terrorism in the Philippines|Philippines]] were the countries that experienced the most terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 2013 and 2014, the perpetrators responsible for the most terrorist attacks were [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]], [[Taliban|the Taliban]], [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]], [[Boko Haram]], and Maoists. Fifty-five percent of the targets were either private citizens, private property, or police. 66% of attacks in Nigeria and 41% of attacks in Iraq targeted private citizens and property.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The [[Global Terrorism Database]] estimates that &amp;nbsp;that between 2004 and 2013, about 50% of all terrorist attacks, and 60% of fatalities due to terrorist attacks, took place in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Theories==

Theories of political violence can be organized by their [[level of analysis]]:  
* [[Level of analysis|Macro theories]] explain how political, economic, and social processes cause political violence  
* [[Level of analysis|Micro theories]] discuss political violence processes that involve individuals and households, like who participates in violence and what motivates people to participate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balcells|first=Laia|date=December 2014|title=Bridging Micro and Macro Approaches on Civil Wars and Political Violence: Issues, Challenges, and the Way Forward|url=http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/58/8/1343.abstract|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|doi=10.1177/0022002714547905|pmid=|access-date=|volume=58|issue=8|pages=1343–1359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Macro===

====Social conflict theory ====
[[Social conflict theory]] is a [[Marxist]]-based [[social theory]] which states that social systems reflect the vested interests of those who own and control resources. The people in power use the political and economic institutions to exploit groups with less power. This causes the rest of society to become alienated or psychologically separated from the people in power. Revolutions occur to break down the social and economic separation between the people in power and the exploited people and "to achieve equity and social unity".&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collective Political Violence: An Introduction to the Theories and Cases of Violent Conflicts|last=Conteh-Morgan|first=Earl|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=978-0415947435|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== War's inefficiency puzzle ====
[[War's inefficiency puzzle]] explains why states go to war even though war is costly. In [[James Fearon]]’s ''Rationalist Explanations for War'', he asserts war is costly and that creates an incentive to bargain with the other side. However, states do not bargain and instead go to war because of private information on the capability to fight and the incentives to misrepresent this information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fearon|first=James|date=Summer 1995|title=Rationalist Explanations for War|jstor=2706903|journal=International Organization|doi=10.1017/s0020818300033324|pmid=|volume=49|issue=3|pages=379–414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Functionalism ====
[[Functionalism (sociology)|Functionalism]] sees society as "an organism whose entire system has to be in good working order for systemic equilibrium to be maintained."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However, when there is an unexpected shock to the system, society becomes disorientated allowing for collective violence.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Mass society ====
[[Mass society]] argues that violent social movements come from people who are isolated socially and from political institutions. People who are alienated are easily convinced to join radical or extremist movements.

==== Resource mobilization ====
[[Resource mobilization]] is a theory on social movement that emphasizes the capacity of competing groups to organize and use adequate resources to achieve their goals.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The resources can be time, money, organizational skills, and certain social or political opportunities. Political violence occurs when individuals are able to mobilize sufficient resources to take action.

==== Primordialism ====
[[Ethnic conflict|Primordialism]] is an explanation of [[ethnic violence]] and [[ethnic conflict]]. "Interethnic differences based on racial, language, religious, regional characteristics, and other visible markers produce interethnic conflicts because members of that same group emotionally identify with their in-group, but feel no such identify with those outside their ethnic group."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;

==== Instrumentalist ====
[[Ethnic conflict|Instrumentalism]] is an explanation of [[ethnic violence]] and [[ethnic conflict]]. Ethnicity is not inherent in human nature. Conflict occurs when leaders manipulate ethnicity for the sake of political power or economic gain.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ashutoshvarshney.net/wp-content/files_mf/varshneyethnicityandethnicconflict.pdf|title=Ethnicity and Ethnic Conflict|last=Varshney|first=Ashutosh|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Constructivist ====
[[Ethnic conflict|Constructivist]] is an explanations of [[ethnic violence]] and [[ethnic conflict]]. Ethnic and national identities are socially constructed and are formed through social, economic and political processes, like colonization and conquest. Ethnic conflict is a product of the factors shaping ethnic identity and not from ethnicity itself.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== Youth bulge ====
A [[Population pyramid|youth bulge]] occurs when there is disproportionate percentage of a state population being between the ages of 15 and 24 years old. It occurs when infant mortality rates decrease and fertility rate increase. This youth bulge increases the working-age population; however, it does not translate to more jobs being available, which leads to severe unemployment. This will cause the young adult male population to "prolong dependency on parents, diminish self-esteem and fuel frustrations".&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/world/effects-youth-bulge-civil-conflicts/p13093|title=The Effects of 'Youth Bulge' on Civil Conflicts|last=Beehner|first=Lionel|date=April 27, 2007|website=Council on Foreign Relations|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads the youth to "seek social and economic advancement by alternative, extralegal means", which means that the [[opportunity cost]]s to join armed movements are low.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===Micro===

====Rational choice theory====
[[Rational choice theory]] is a decision-making approach in which the decisions makers compare the expected utility of competing options and select the option that produces the most favorable outcome. Political violence occurs when the benefits in participating in political violence outweighs the costs.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Relative deprivation ====
In ''Why Men Rebel'', [[Ted Robert Gurr]] uses [[Relative deprivation|relative deprivation theory]] to explain why men commit acts of violence. As Gurr explains, relative deprivation "is defined as actors' perception of discrepancy between their value expectations and their value capabilities."&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Why Men Rebel|last=Gurr|first=Ted|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=978-1594519147|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, relative deprivation is the gap between the wants and needs we{{Who|date=August 2016}} feel we deserve versus what we are capable of "getting and keeping."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The collective discontent, the gap between the expected and achieved welfare, leads people to resort to violence.

==== Collective action theory ====
[[Collective action theory]] explains why people participate in rebellions.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muller|first=Edward N.|last2=Opp|first2=Karl-Dieter|date=1986-01-01|title=Rational Choice and Rebellious Collective Action|jstor=1958269|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=80|issue=2|pages=471–488|doi=10.2307/1958269}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person decides to participate or not participate in a rebellion based on the benefits and costs. Generally, people decide to be [[Free rider problem|free riders]] and not to participate in the rebellion. These people will still receive the benefits of the rebellion since the benefits are a [[public good]]. However, if people are expected to receive [[private good]]s, like material rewards or power, then that person is expected to rebel.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

==== Greed versus grievance ====
[[Greed versus grievance]] provides two lines of explanations as to why individuals will fight. Individuals are said to be motivated by greed when they decide to join a conflict in an effort to better their situation and find that benefits of joining a rebellion or any kind of collective violence is greater than not joining.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collier|first=Paul|last2=Hoeffler|first2=Anke|date=2004-10-01|title=Greed and grievance in civil war|url=http://oep.oxfordjournals.org/content/56/4/563|journal=Oxford Economic Papers|language=en|volume=56|issue=4|pages=563–595|doi=10.1093/oep/gpf064|issn=0030-7653|citeseerx=10.1.1.17.7530}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals are said to be motivated by grievance when they fight over "high inequality, a lack of political rights or ethnic and religious divisions in society."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In "Greed and Grievance in Civil War", Paul Collier and Anke Hoeffler argue that greed is a better predictor of participating in violence than grievance.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

== Consequences ==

In the aftermath of political violence, there are many changes that occur within the state, society, and the individual.

=== Macro ===
Social science literature that examines how political violence affects the region, state, nation, and society.

==== State-building ====

Charles Tilly argues that "war making", eliminating rivals outside a territory, "state making", eliminating rivals within a territory, "protection", protecting subjects within a territory, and "extraction", extracting resources to "[carry] out the first three activities", are what defines a state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=War Making and State Making as Organized Crime|last=Tilly|first=Charles|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|isbn=9780521313131|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All four actives depend on the state's ability to use and monopolize violence. In other words, politically and non-politically motivated violence is necessary in state-building and building [[fiscal capacity]].

=== Micro===

There are a growing number of social science studies that examine how political violence affects individuals and households. It is important to keep in mind that what happens at the individual and household level can affect what happens at the macro level. For example, political violence effects an individual's income, health, and education attainment, but these individual consequences combined can effect a state or nation's economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blattman|first=Christopher|last2=Miguel|first2=Edward|date=2010-03-01|title=Civil War|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=48|issue=1|pages=3–57|doi=10.1257/jel.48.1.3|issn=0022-0515}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the macro and micro consequences of political violence do not occur in a vacuum.

====Political impacts====

There are empirical studies that link violence with increases in political participation. One [[natural experiment]] examines the effect of being abducted by [[Joseph Kony]]'s [[Lord's Resistance Army|LRA]] on political participation. An abducted male Ugandan youth, or in other words a former child soldier, had a greater probability of voting for [[Ugandan multi-party referendum, 2005|Uganda's 2005 referendum]] and being a community mobilizer/leader than a male Ugandan youth who wasn't abducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blattman|first=Christopher|date=2009-05-01|title=From Violence to Voting: War and Political Participation in Uganda|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0003055409090212|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=103|issue=2|pages=231–247|doi=10.1017/S0003055409090212|issn=1537-5943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this effect is not just contained to Uganda. Another natural experiment on the effects of the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|Sierra Leone civil war]] found that victimized households, household whose members were killed, injured, maimed, captured, or made refugees, were more likely to register to vote, attend community meetings, and participate in local political and community groups than households that did not experience violence.&lt;ref name="Bellows 1144–1157"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bellows|first=John|last2=Miguel|first2=Edward|date=2009-12-01|title=War and local collective action in Sierra Leone|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272709000942|journal=Journal of Public Economics|volume=93|issue=11–12|pages=1144–1157|doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2009.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic impacts====

A study on the effects of the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|Sierra Leone civil war]] found that victimized households, household whose members were killed, injured, maimed, captured, or displaced, did not have long-term impacts on owning assets, child nutrition, consumption expenditures and earnings.&lt;ref name="Bellows 1144–1157"/&gt;

== Datasets ==

===Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) ===
{{Main article|Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project}}

The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) is a project that collates data on political violence and protest in developing states, from 1997 to the present. As of early 2016, ACLED has recorded over 100,000 individual events, with ongoing data collection focused on Africa and ten countries in South and Southeast Asia. The data can be used for medium- and long-term analysis and mapping of political violence across developing countries through use of historical data from 1997, as well as informing humanitarian and development work in crisis and conflict-affected contexts through real time data updates and reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acleddata.com/|title=ACLED - ACLED|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACLED defines "political violence" as "the use of force by a group with a political purpose or motivation." The database uses this definition to catalog a number of what it refers to as political events across Africa and South East Asia. Political events are described as "a single altercation where often force is used by one or more groups for a political end. The data project catalogs nine different types of events.&lt;ref name="acleddata.com"&gt;http://www.acleddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ACLED_Codebook_2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human Security Report Project===
{{Main article|Human Security Report Project}}

The [[Human Security Report Project]] or '''HSRP''' catalogs global and regional trends in organized violence, their causes and consequences. Research findings and analyses are published in the Human Security Report, Human Security Brief series, and the miniAtlas of Human Security based in Vancouver, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsrgroup.org/about-hsrp/about-us.aspx|title=Human Security Report Project: About Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using data from the [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]], the report tracks 5 types of violence 
* '''State-based armed conflict''' are cataloged as international conflicts and civil wars—in which at least
one of the warring parties is the government of a state.
'''Interstate Conflicts''' are conflicts between two states. 
'''Intrastate Conflicts''' happen within a state such as a civil war. 
* '''Non-state armed conflicts''' are conflicts which consist of fighting between two armed groups,
neither of which is the government of a state
* '''One-sided violence''' is thought of as targeted attacks against unarmed civilians.&lt;ref name="hsrgroup.org"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8038">{{Psychoanalysis |Concepts}}

In [[psychoanalysis]], '''preconscious''' is the loci preceding consciousness. Thoughts are preconscious when they are unconscious at a particular moment, but are not [[psychological repression|repressed]]. Therefore, preconscious thoughts  are available for recall and easily 'capable of becoming conscious'—a phrase attributed by [[Sigmund Freud]] to [[Joseph Breuer]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud contrasted the preconscious (Psc.; {{lang-de|das Vorbewusste}}) to both the conscious (Cs.; ''das Bewusste'') and the unconscious (Ucs.; ''das Unbewusste'') in his topographical system of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Metapsychology'' pp. 196–8&lt;/ref&gt;

The preconscious can also refer to information  available for [[cognitive processing]] but that currently lies outside conscious awareness. One of the most common forms of preconscious processing is [[priming (psychology)|priming]]. Other common forms of preconscious processing are [[tip of the tongue]] phenomenon and [[blindsight]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Sternberg and Karin Sternberg, ''Cognitive Psychology''  (2012) p.  180&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud's 'Topographical' System==

In 1900, in his book, ''Interpretation of Dreams,'' Freud introduced the notion that the unconscious mind is not merely used to describe the opposite of consciousness. Instead, he insisted that there exist two spheres in the unconscious: unconscious and preconscious.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/965512|title=The standard edition of the complete psychological works of Sigmund Freud. Volume V (1900 -1) Interpretation of Dreams II and On Dreams|last=Freud, Sigmund|first=|date=|publisher=Hogarth Press|others=Strachey, James., Freud, Anna, 1895-1982,, Rothgeb, Carrie Lee, 1925-, Richards, Angela., Scientific Literature Corporation.|year=1978|isbn=0701200677|location=London,|pages=614 - 615|oclc=965512}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reserved the term unconscious for thoughts that are inadmissible to consciousness, while the term preconscious was used to denote the screen between the unconscious and conscious. The preconscious restricts access to consciousness and is responsible for voluntary movement and attention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Freud further explained the distinction as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 2) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;". . . two kinds of unconscious—one which is easily, under frequently occurring circumstances, transformed into something conscious, and another with which this transformation is difficult and takes place only subject to a considerable expenditure of effort or possibly never at all. [...] We call the unconscious which is only latent, and thus easily becomes conscious, the 'preconscious', and retain the term 'unconscious' for the other".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As explained by [[David Stafford-Clark]],&lt;ref&gt;David Stafford-Clark, ''What Freud Really Said'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If consciousness is then the sum total of everything of which we are aware, pre-consciousness is the reservoir of everything we can remember, all that is accessible to voluntary recall: the storehouse of memory. This leaves the unconscious area of mental life to contain all the more primitive drives and impulses influencing our actions without our necessarily ever becoming fully aware of them, together with every important constellation of ideas or memories with a strong emotional charge, which have at one time been present in consciousness but have since been repressed so that they are no longer available to it, even through introspection or attempts at memory".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Freud's original German term for the preconscious was ''das Vorbewusste'',&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Metapsychology'' p. 53n&lt;/ref&gt; the unconscious being ''das Unbewusste''.

===Characteristics===

Freud saw the preconscious as characterised by reality-testing, recallable memories, and (above all) links to word-presentations—the key distinction from the contents of the unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Metapsychology'' pp. 192–207&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 2 of his book, ''The Ego and the ID,'' Freud explains that the real difference between an unconscious idea and a preconscious idea is that unconscious ideas are based on unknown material, whereas preconscious ideas are usually brought into consciousness via connections with word-presentations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/965512|title=The standard edition of the complete psychological works of Sigmund Freud. Volume XIX (1923-25) The Ego and the ID and Other Works|last=Freud, Sigmund|first=|date=|publisher=Hogarth Press|others=Strachey, James., Freud, Anna, 1895-1982,, Rothgeb, Carrie Lee, 1925-, Richards, Angela., Scientific Literature Corporation.|year=1978|isbn=0701200677|location=London,|pages=5-18|oclc=965512}}&lt;/ref&gt; Word-presentations are memory traces that were at one time a perception, and therefore, can become conscious again. The only way then, he stated, for something from the unconscious to be brought into the preconscious was by supplying the preconscious with the intermediate links that connect the unconscious thought with an associated word or picture in the preconscious.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Relation to the Ego, Id, and Superego ===
The above described distinctions between the conscious, preconscious, and unconscious represent Freud's spatial systems of the mind.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1923, in addition to these spacial dimensions, Freud introduced three distinct, interacting agents of the mind: the id, ego, and superego. These three agents are described in further detail [[Id, ego and super-ego|here]], but in short, they are separate and distinct, though somewhat overlapping with Freud's earlier division between conscious, preconscious, and unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures'' p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Ego is the coherent organizational of mental processes, often to which consciousness is attached, but it can also exist in the preconscious by censoring content in the unconscious. The ego is also capable of exerting resistance on mental material, and therefore, it is also capable of being unconscious in the dynamic sense.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;The id is the wholly unconscious agent of the mind that consists of drives and repressed material. The ego and the id interact, as the ego seeks to bring the influence of the external world to bear on the id. In short, the ego represents reason and common sense and the id contains deep seated passions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The superego represents an ideal self defined in childhood, largely shaped by resolution of the Oedipal conflict.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==In Therapy==

Much of the work of the therapist takes place at a preconscious level in a clinical situation.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, it is possible to distinguish among the patient's products preconscious [[transference]] phantasies from unconscious ones.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph J. Sandler]], ''Freud's Models of the Mind'' (1997) p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Berne]] considered that the preconscious covered a much wider area of the mind than was generally recognised, a 'cult' of the unconscious leading to its over-estimation by both analyst and analysand.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello?'' (1974) p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Production leveling''', also known as '''production smoothing''' or – by its Japanese original term – {{nihongo|'''heijunka'''|平準化}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessknowledgesource.com/manufacturing/production_leveling_extended_entry_026155.html Businessknowledgesource.com]&lt;/ref&gt; is a technique for reducing the Mura (Unevenness) which in turn reduces [[Muda (Japanese term)|muda]] (waste). It was vital to the development of production efficiency in the [[Toyota Production System]] and [[lean manufacturing]].  The goal is to produce intermediate goods at a constant rate so that further processing may also be carried out at a constant and predictable rate.

Where demand is constant, production leveling is easy, but where customer demand fluctuates, two approaches have been adopted: 1) ''demand leveling'' and 2) ''production leveling'' through flexible production.

To prevent fluctuations in production, even in outside affiliates, it is important to minimize fluctuation in the final assembly line. Toyota's final assembly line never assembles the same automobile model in a batch. Instead, they level production by assembling a mix of models in each batch&lt;ref&gt;Toyota Production System, Taiichi Ohno, Productivity Press, p 126&lt;/ref&gt; and the batches are made as small as possible.

== Production leveling by volume or by product type or mix ==
Production leveling can refer to leveling by volume, or leveling by product type or mix, although the two are closely related.

=== Leveling by volume ===
If for a family of products that use the same production process there is a demand that varies between 800 and 1,200 units then it might seem a good idea to produce the amount ordered. Toyota's view is that production systems that vary in the required output suffer from [[Mura (Japanese term)|mura]] and [[Muri (Japanese term)|muri]] with capacity being 'forced' in some periods. So their approach is to manufacture at the long-term average demand and carry an inventory proportional to the variability of demand, stability of the production process and the frequency of shipments. So for our case of 800–1,200 units, if the production process were 100% reliable and the shipments once a week, then the production would be with minimum standard inventory of 200 at the start of the week and 1,200 at the point of shipment. The advantage of carrying this inventory is that it can smooth production throughout the plant and therefore reduce process inventories and simplify operations which reduces costs.

=== Leveling by product ===
Most value streams produce a mix of products and therefore face a choice of production mix and sequence. It is here that the discussions on [[economic order quantity|economic order quantities]] take place and have been dominated by [[changeover]] times and the inventory this requires. Toyota's approach resulted in a different discussion where it reduced the time and cost of changeovers so that smaller and smaller batches were not prohibitive and lost production time and quality costs were not significant. This meant that the demand for components could be leveled for the upstream sub-processes and therefore lead time and total inventories reduced along the entire value stream. To simplify leveling of products with different demand levels a related [[Visual Control|visual scheduling]] board known as a [[heijunka box]] is often used in achieving these heijunka style efficiencies. Other [[Production levelling|production leveling]] techniques based on this thinking have also been developed. Once leveling by product is achieved then there is one more leveling phase, that of "[[Just in Sequence]]" where leveling occurs at the lowest level of product production.

The use of production leveling as well as broader [[lean production]] techniques helped [[Toyota Production System|Toyota]] massively reduce vehicle production times as well as inventory levels during the 1980s.

=== Implementation ===
Even Toyota hasn't reached the final stage in this journey, single-piece flows, across all of their processes; indeed they recommend following their journey rather than trying to jump into an intermediate stage. The reason Toyota advocate this is that each production stage is accompanied by adjustments and adaptations to support services to production; if those services are not given these adaptation steps then major issues can arise.

# '''Implement green stream/red stream or fixed sequence, fixed volume''' to establish the entry and exit criteria for products from these streams and establish the supporting disciplines in the support services. The cycle established will produce Every Product Every Cycle (EPEC). This is a specific form of [[Fixed Repeating Schedule]]. Green stream products are those with predictable demand, Red stream products are high value unpredictable demand products.
# '''Faster fixed sequence with fixed volume''' keep the streams the same but use the now established familiarity with the streams to maximise learning and improve speed of production (economies of repetition). This will allow the shortening of the EPEC cycle so that the plant is now producing every product every 2 weeks instead of month and then later on repeating every week. This may require support services to speed up as well.
# '''Fixed sequence with unfixed volume''' keep the stream sequences the same but now phase in allowing actual sales to influence volumes within those sequences. This affects inbound componentry as well as support services. This is a more generalised form of [[Fixed Repeating Schedule]].
# '''Unfixed sequence with fixed volume''' the stream sequences, and EPEC, can now be gradually flexed but move to small fixed batch sizes to make this more manageable.
# '''Unfixed sequence with unfixed volume''' finally move to true single piece flow and pull by reducing batch sizes until they reach one.

== Demand leveling ==
'''Demand leveling''' is the deliberate influencing of demand itself or the demand processes to deliver a more predictable pattern of customer demand. Some of this influencing is by manipulating the product offering, some by influencing the ordering process and some by revealing the [[demand amplification]] induced variability of ordering patterns. Demand levelling does not include influencing activities designed to clear existing stock.

Historically demand leveling evolved as subset of production levelling and has been approached in a variety of ways:

*The first approach to demand levelling involves careful management of the sales pipeline. For this method of demand management it is instructive to look at Toyota in its home market, Japan. Toyota sales teams sell cars door-to-door whereby they build customer profiles and relationships. The sales process is low intensity but includes test drives, financing, insurance and trade-in deals.&lt;ref&gt;The Machine that changed the World, Womack, Jones and Roos, Macmillan Publishing, p183, {{ISBN|0-89256-350-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale itself is by special order placed with their representative. This means that orders can be predicted reasonably accurately in terms of vehicle numbers some way in advance. Finer specific vehicle details may only become known with the order. However, the order is often for delivery in the future so these details can usually be planned before build. Because the customer is getting the exact car they want there is less negotiation around price as indeed the fact that the build is to order removes the incentive of the manufacturer, or their agent, to discount existing stock. The aim of this system is to maximise the revenue from the customer in the long term. This leads to the sales team handling after-sales issues of diverse kinds for an extended period to keep customer loyalty and the relationship which will sell the next car. Between purchases the sales team remain in touch for all aspects of customer satisfaction with their cars including feedback for product design on changing customer preferences in the market. The Japanese market does not have the seasonal, promotional or other demand surges that are a characteristic of Western automotive markets. It is debated, for both markets, whether this is caused by manufacturers' behaviour or whether manufacturers' behaviour is a logical response to it.
*A second approach to demand levelling is by deep understanding of the systems used to order products by retailers and other sellers from manufacturers. Even where this [[supply chain]] is very simple, customer-retailer-manufacturer, it is usually the case that orders are based on some form of [[economic order quantity]] (EOQ) calculation that aggregates actual customer demand over a certain period. This aggregation, and the other clever calculations that may be involved, often obscure the fact that actual demand for a product is close to flat, and for high volume products very close to flat. The demand pulsing effect is created by the ordering process and the more complex it is the greater this effect. The use of [[Point of sale|EPOS]] actual sales data can reveal this effect very clearly.
*A third approach to demand management is to keep finished goods or nearly finished goods in stock to act as a buffer and thus isolate the production facility from actual demand.  This approach is widely used today but its weakness is becoming more and more evident as a growing variety of products is demanded. The cost of making, storing, managing and protecting finished goods stock can grow to be prohibitive depending upon product range and demand variability levels. This usually means that actually whilst stocks are kept they are insufficient to meet the stated aims and so customer dissatisfaction ensues along with distressed sales (reduced price) to eliminate stock levels seen as too high.

===Implementation===

If it is accepted that a large part of demand variability in high volume products can be substantially caused by sales and ordering process artifacts then analysis and leveling can be attempted.

The use of long delay [[supply chain]]s to reduce manufacturing costs often means that production orders are placed long before customer demand can be realistically estimated. The much later arrival of forecast product demand volumes makes demand leveling irrelevant since the issue has now switched to disposal at best price possible products that are already created and possibly paid for. Demand leveling has only proven possible where build times have been made relatively low and production has been made relatively reliable and flexible. Examples of these are fast airborne supply chains (e.g. Apple iPod) or direct to customer selling through web sites allowing late customisation (e.g. [[NIKEiD]] custom shoes) or local manufacture (e.g. [[Timbuk2]] custom courier bags).

Where actual build-delivery times can be brought within the same scale as customer time horizons then effort to modify impulse buying and make it somewhat planned can be successful. Reliable, flexible manufacturing will then mean that low stock levels (if any) do not interfere with customer satisfaction and that incentives to sell what has been produced eliminated.

Where demand follows a predictable pattern, e.g. flat, then regular deliveries of constant amounts can be agreed with variances in actual demand ignored unless it exceeds some agreed trigger level. Where this cannot be agreed then it can be simulated and the benefits gained through [[frequent deliveries]] and a [[Manufacturing supermarket|market location]].

The predictable pattern does not have to be flat and may, for example, be an annual pattern with higher volumes at particular periods. Here again the deliveries can be agreed to follow a simplified but similar pattern, perhaps one delivery volume for six months of the year and another for the other six months.

'''RSVP''' is a process for a response from the invited person or people. It is an [[Acronym and initialism|initialism]] derived from the [[French language|French]] phrase '''''Répondez s'il vous plaît''''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.linternaute.com/dictionnaire/fr/definition/rsvp/|title=Rsvp : Définition simple et facile du dictionnaire|website=www.linternaute.com|language=fr|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "Please respond" to require confirmation of an invitation. The initialism "RSVP"  is no longer used much in France, where it is considered formal and old-fashioned (if not totally unknown by most French people). In French, the complete sentence "Répondez s'il vous plaît"  gives the impression the speaker is begging for an answer. In France, it is now more common to use "Réponse attendue avant le...", meaning "[Your] answer is expected before...". In addition, the French initialism "SVP" is frequently used to represent "s'il vous plaît" ("please").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.linternaute.com/dictionnaire/fr/definition/svp/|title=Svp : Définition simple et facile du dictionnaire|website=www.linternaute.com|language=fr|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== RSVP, regrets only==

The phrase "RSVP, regrets only", or simply "Regrets only", is a popular modern variation that implies "if you do not reply, that will be taken as an acceptance."

More specifically, if most invitations can be assumed to be accepted, a "regrets only" RSVP will reduce the communication required by both the host and their guests. The phrase "Regrets only" refers to the assumption that a declination will be worded with some variation of "We regret we cannot attend...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.announcingit.com/how_to/RSVP_vs_Regrets_Only.htm |title=RSVP vs. Regrets Only |website=www.announcingit.com |series=Invitation Do's and Don'ts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Save the date cards==
Prior to sending the RSVP invitation, the host may mail out a "save the date" card to advise the date and location of the celebration. This may be used when the event will be held a considerable time in the future and/or in a distant location to allow for travel plans, for such events as a wedding, christening, or any other important event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emilypost.com/weddings/new-times-new-traditions/368-21st-century-wedding-trends|title=Invitation Etiquette|publisher=The Emily Post Institute, Inc.|accessdate=2012-06-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620042020/http://www.emilypost.com/weddings/new-times-new-traditions/368-21st-century-wedding-trends|archivedate=2012-06-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==RSVP please==
In recent years, the use of RSVP in the English language has spread outside of the discourse of highly formal correspondence and commonly figures in group emails. In this context, the acronym seems to have loosened its tie to its original meaning and is often understood simply as an abbreviation for "reply". Some writers therefore routinely use the phrase "RSVP please",{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} which is a case of [[RAS syndrome]] or a [[pleonasm]].

'''Raison Oblige Theory''' offers an alternate explanation of exhibited behaviors widely accepted to be caused by the motive of [[Self-verification theory|self-verification (SVT)]]([[William Swann]], 1983).&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr. (1983). Self-verification: Bringing social reality into harmony with the self. In J. Suls &amp; A. G. Greenwald (Eds.), Social psychological perspectives on the self (Vol. 2, pp. 33-66). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory addresses instances of apparent self-view confirmation strivings and details an economical description of why these behaviors occur. Focusing on the importance of the ''self-view'' and rational thought, (see [[self-esteem]]; [[self concept]]; [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self knowledge]]) Raison oblige theory (ROT) accounts for the evidence supporting SVT including the well documented seemingly mal-adaptive self verifying behaviors.

* SVT states that a person is actively motivated to confirm their existing self view regardless of the objective accuracy or valence of that view. In other words, a person wants to confirm their currently held self views above and beyond wanting this information to be accurate or positive.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr., Rentfrow, P. J., &amp; Guinn, J. (2002). Self-verification: The search for coherence. In M. Leary and J. Tagney, Handbook of self and identity:  Guilford, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Self-verification theory|self verification]] for details).
* ROT challenges the existence of a motive and offers a plausible explanation which can account for all instances of self-verifying behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, A. P.(2007). Is identity per se irrelevant? A contrarian view of self-verification effects. Depression and Anxiety, 0, 1-11&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fundamentals of ROT are that people are obliged by reason to accept information that is congruent with their currently held self views and reject information that is not. The theory challenges a self-verification motive, stating that people do not want to self-verify, they simply convey, through behaviour, cognitions that accurately and honestly reflect their own self views.

ROT was developed by Aiden P. Gregg (2006).

==Overview==

===Self verification===

Self-verifying behavior includes any action which ultimately coincides with and reinforces existing self-views.
*Motivation to self-enhance causes a person with positive self-views to seek positive information: This verifies positivity.
*People with negative self-views, including those diagnosed with depression, show a preference for negative information: This verifies negativity.

An array of empirical evidence demonstrates numerous examples of self-verification.

People with negative self-views prefer to interact with actors who reinforce negative assessments :
::* Evaluators.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr., &amp; Read, S. J. (1981b). Acquiring self-knowledge: The search for feedback that fits. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 41,1119-1128.&lt;/ref&gt;
::* Romantic partners.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr., De La Ronde, C. &amp; Hixon, J. G. (1994). Authenticity and positivity strivings in marriage and courtship. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 66, 857-869.&lt;/ref&gt;
::* Roommates.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr. &amp; Pelham, B. W.  (2002). Who wants out when the going gets good? Psychological investment and preference for self-verifying college roommates.  Journal of Self and Identity, 1, 219-233.&lt;/ref&gt;
::* Group members&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr., Milton, L. P., &amp; Polzer, J.T. (2000). Should we create a niche or fall in line? Identity negotiation and small group effectiveness. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 79, 238-250.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of conditions which influence the likelihood of engaging in self verification;
::* Importance of a self view (swann &amp; Pelham 2002)
::* Extremity of a self view.&lt;ref&gt;Giesler, R. B., Josephs, R. A. &amp; Swann, W. B., Jr. (1996). Self-verification in clinical depression. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 105, 358-368.&lt;/ref&gt;
::* Certainty of a self view.&lt;ref&gt;Pelham, B. W., &amp; Swann, W. B., Jr. (1994). The juncture of intrapersonal and interpersonal knowledge: Self-certainty and interpersonal congruence. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 20, 349-357.&lt;/ref&gt;
::* Perceived threat to identity; (see Swann et al., 2002)
:::* Intelligence of evaluator
:::* Importance of partner providing information (Swann, De La Ronde &amp; Hixon, 1994)

The collective evidence of self-verifying processes and conditions has been interpreted as a motivation to self-verify.

For example; Depressed people opt to receive negative information despite positivity striving of the [[self-enhancement]] motive. This has therefore been interpreted as the result of motivation to self verify. (Giesler et al., 1996)

===Origins of ROT===

The theory originated from criticism of the evidence supporting SVT.

Gregg (2007) disputed that the evidence was weak and circumstantial, and importantly could be better and more economically explained via Raison oblige theory.

Both theories acknowledged the abundance of evidence showing that people behave in a way that confirms their self-view, even when this reinforcement is seemingly [[adaptive behavior|maladaptive]]. As with most psychological theories, observation of behavior provided the most compelling evidence for self verification theory.

::* However, just because a person acts in a certain way does not necessarily dictate that the usually related [[Motivation|motive]] for this behavior is responsible or indeed that the person wants to act this way. Self-defeating behavior such as drug abuse, which is clearly not in the person’s best interest, does not certify that there is a motive to self-defeat.

::* In such an instance it is suggested that the person does not want to act against their best interests, but that they want immediate relief from negative [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] (Baumeister &amp; Scher, 1988).&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R. F., Scher, S. J. (1988). Self-defeating behavior patterns among normal individuals: review and analysis of common self destructive tendencies. Psychology Bulletin, 104, 3–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

ROT, unlike SVT, does not explain the observed behavior in terms of a motive. Instead it suggests that an active cognitive process obliges a person to behave in a way that honestly reflects their currently held self-views.

===Underlying assumptions===

[[Rationality]] is often overlooked when considering the causes of exhibited behaviors. When compared to the motives of self-enhancement, self-improvement and self-assessment the effects of rationality might be assumed to be small. However, Gregg (2007) outlines that “rationality is pervasive and motives merely qualify it”.

*ROT draws upon the ability of ration to influence our behaviors and [[cognition]]s.
*Evidence for the effects of rationality are easily seen yet often overlooked due to the compared power of [[Motivation|motives]].

However, if rationality did not strongly influence cognition, self-assessment would rarely be accurate and grandiose [[delusion]]s would be common. As a result, self-enhancement and self-improvement would also be hindered as people would have an inaccurate self-concept and thus be unaware of whether they needed to enhance or improve. Without some sort of obligation to reasonable thought it is unlikely anyone would have an accurate self-concept or strive to make something of themselves.

* This assumption underlies ROT and is the rationale for suggesting that there is a plausible alternative explanation for the evidence of self verifying behaviors.

===Hypothetical situation===

When given the option to interact with person (A) who shares my self views or person (B) who does not, I will opt for person A.

*ROT explains that this choice is based on whether I can earnestly believe the information to be true and representative of myself. Despite the desire for positive information to be true, if I cannot subjectively believe it then I will ignore it.

This hypothetical preference for people who share my self view and avoidance of those who don't has been empirically replicated many times (e.g. Swann, 92;&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr., Wenzlaff, R. M., Krull, D. S., &amp; Pelham, B. W. (1992). The allure of negative feedback: Self-verification strivings among depressed persons. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 101, 293-306&lt;/ref&gt; swann 03; Gregg 07)

Importantly, this behavior in which we create a world which shares our self-views does not necessarily demonstrate a motive to do so (Gregg, 07). In fact, if rationality were removed it is likely we would not adhere to self views at all. Instead people would be able to choose a self view they liked and exhibit behaviors accordingly.

*Every healthy person is aware of reality and adheres to an unspoken set of rules of reason permitting them to act in accordance with their physical and mental ability.
*Perceptions of the world around us are bound by rational thought and evidence. Raison Oblige theory extends this binding to reason into the conceptions of our selves, i.e. self view.

==Negative and positive self views==

===Self-esteem===

[[Self-esteem]] has a very strong influence on a person’s self-view. A person with high self-esteem is more likely to have a positive self-view, whereas a person with low self-esteem is more likely to have a negative self-view. Many studies that seemingly provide evidence for a self-verifying motive use self-esteem as a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] to demonstrate that people confirm a self-view that corresponds to their level of self-esteem.

However, one can argue that this behavioral evidence is circumstantial and that the [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] does not demonstrate motivation.

*If a person with low self-esteem confirmed a self-view congruent to that of low self-esteem, it does not necessarily provide evidence for motivation to confirm a self-view.
*ROT claims that people are aware of their self-views and believe them to be accurate. As a result, they answer questionnaires honestly, and report their self-views as they truly see them due to an obligation to reason.

people may not ''want'' self-verifying information to be true of them and may ''want'' others to view them positively rather than negatively.

Further research needs to be undertaken to fully investigate the relationship between self views and self-esteem. (see. Gregg, 2007)
::*Do people with low self-esteem ''want'' critical feedback to be true; are they motivated?
::*Do people with low self-esteem actually ''want'' their self view to be accurate, or would they prefer a more positive self view?

ROT predicts that people with low self-esteem are bound by reason to confirm their existing self view but that they don’t necessarily like it (Gregg &amp; De Waal-Anderws, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, A. P., &amp; De Waal-Andrews W. (2007). Choices for, and perceptions of, global and specific hypothetical feedback of differential valence. Unpublished raw data, School of Psychology, University of Southampton, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; If a motivation to self-verify were present then people with low self-esteem would not care about what their self-view was, they would instead focus on actively trying to confirm it.

===Depression===

[[Depression (mood)|Depression]] is accompanied by very low self-esteem and has therefore been a topic of strong interest for those investigating self verifying behaviors. Depression is always accompanied by low self-esteem but having low self-esteem does not necessarily mean you are depressed.

It argued that those suffering with depression, or with generally low negative self-views, will actively seek negative feedback in order to confirm their self-view; they find it more favourable. Giesler et al. (1996)&lt;ref&gt;Giesler, R. B., Josephs, R. A., &amp; Swann, W. B. Jr. (1996). Self-verification in clinical depression. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 105, 358–368.&lt;/ref&gt; tested this prediction by classifying participants into three separate groups; high self-esteem, low self-esteem and depressed individuals. When offered a choice of positive or negative feedback, depressed individuals chose to receive negative feedback 82% of the time, suggesting a strong desire to negatively re-affirm their self view. The seeking of negative feedback in order to self-verify has thus been argued to maintain a depressive state.

ROT challenges this interpretation and suggests that the observed behavior and maintenance of depressive state is caused by an obligation to confirm a depressive self-concept. This particular study, and many others like it can be reinterpreted using ROT. The choice of negative feedback reflects the obligation to choose information consistent with an honestly held self view.

[[Correlation does not imply causation|Correlations do not equal causation]]; The evidence for SVT assumptions of motivation drawn from studies on depression could be circumstantial and therefore do not provide explicit proof of a motive to self-verify.

====Depression, Motivation and Desire====

Motivation is interlinked with desire. I am hungry therefore I am motivated to eat food; I want to eat.

In SVT studies of depressed persons they are asked whether they would like to receive favorable or unfavorable feedback on their personality. In concurrence with SVT and ROT predictions they chose the unfavorable feedback due to a negative self-view.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr., Pelham, B. W., &amp; Krull, D. S. (1989). Agreeable fancy or disagreeable truth? How people reconcile their self-enhancement and self-verification needs. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 57, 782-791&lt;/ref&gt;  These studies demonstrate that self-enhancement striving has been overridden by a separate cognitive process.

If a person with high self-esteem confirms their self-view this may not be self-verification as this is more likely to be due to the self-enhancement motive. Therefore, SVT and ROT studies tend to focus on depressive participants who's verification of negative information can not be attributed to self-enhancement.

*However, Recent findings show that people with depression and high self-esteem both want to receive favorable feedback more than critical feedback.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, A. P., &amp; De Waal-Andrews, W. (2007). Choices for, and perceptions of, global and specific hypothetical feedback of differential valence. Unpublished raw data, School of Psychology, University of Southampton, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

::*This suggests that people do not ''want'' to receive feedback that confirms their self-view. A lack of desire implies that motivation is not responsible for self-verification.

::*Gregg &amp; De Waal-Andrews (2007) also show that the lower a participant's self-esteem, the less they anticipated liking critical feedback, and the less keen they were for it to be true, supporting ROT predictions.

===Relationships===

One example that is well explained by Raison Oblige Theory is why people stay in abusive relationships. According to Rusbult and Martz (1995) more than 40% of women who seek help from a shelter when being abused by their partner then return to living with their partner and remain in the abusive relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Rusbult, C. E., &amp; Martz, J. M. (1995). Remaining in an abusive relationship: An investment model analysis of nonvoluntary dependence. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21(6), 558-571.&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-verification theory would explain this by the abused partner’s need to self-verify that the way they are being treated is deserved, in order to establish an accurate self-concept (Swann &amp; Ely, 1984).&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr., &amp; Ely, R. J. (1984). A battle of wills: Self-verification versus behavioral confirmation. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 46, 1287-1302.&lt;/ref&gt;

However the alternative explanation from Raison Oblige Theory is that an abused individual will rationalise the situation they are in and come to the conclusion that they themselves are in some way causing the abuse. This leads to the honest belief that they deserve the abuse and causes feelings of worthlessness. This results in the abused individual remaining loyal to their partner and failing to seek help, as they believe the abuse is their fault and that they need to improve in some way in order that the abuse will stop. Raison Oblige Theory also explains that the abused partner feels that they will gain no benefit from leaving an abusive relationship, as they see the abuse as their fault. This also explains why the abused individual may defend their partner should anyone outside the relationship become aware of the abuse.

==Evidence==

The mind is difficult to study, often multiple theories can explain a single phenomenon. A theory which explains said phenomenon  more efficiently or can explain additional behaviors is considered the more plausible theory.

*There is no explicit evidence that proves the existence of a motive to self-verify. However, there is a vast expanse of evidence to show that people are obligated to reason in their thoughts.

===Motivation and affect===

Behavior does not always reflect motivation;

::*we do things we don't want to do but are obliged to do (e.g. giving up leisure time to do work)
::*we voluntarily refrain from doing things that we want to do (e.g. making up qualifications to secure a job we want)
::*These examples demonstrate that behavior does not always reflect motivation. However, they do demonstrate a cognitive overruling of desire/motive.

*Motivation incurs negative affect when conditions are not met; I want to improve, I fail; I feel bad.
*Striving to self verify should have an influence on affect.
*A person with a negative self view should therefore be less disturbed by critical feedback than a person with high self-esteem.
::* Depressed: Critical feedback negatively influences their self enhancing motive but bolsters their self verification motive.
::* High self-esteem :critical feedback negatively influences their self enhancing motive(ego) and their self verification motive.

::*High self-esteemed people should be more emotionally disturbed by critical feedback than depressed people. However, this is not the case (Jones, 1975;&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, R. D., &amp; Jones, K. W. (1975). Effects of work load, role ambiguity and Type A personality on anxiety, depression and heart rate. Journal of Applied Psychology, 60, 713-719.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor &amp; Brown, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S. E., &amp; Brown, J. D. (1988). Illusion and Well-Being - a Social Psychological Perspective On Mental-Health. Psychological Bulletin, 103(2), 193-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obligation to ration===

*Day to day examples of obligation to reason; Grandiose delusions are rare.
*We accept new self views after a change in appearance or capabilities; we rationalize changes and challenges.
*People are reasonable in thought, without reason grandiose delusions would have prevented the existence of our species; I can't be killed; I can fight this mammoth alone; I can attack this man without consequence; I am the best person in the world.

====The effect of Ration on motivation====

Self-assessment is bound to rational perception;

::* I believe what is subjectively possible.
::* Assessment is based on accurate perception, not subjective desire: Grandiose delusions are rare

Self-enhancement is bound to rational perception;

::* The [[Illusory superiority|above-average effect]] is bound to the limits of subjective plausibility (Gregg, 2007).
::* specific compared traits succumb to the effect much less because people are aware of their ability compared to others. Commonly held traits can be exaggerated due to a larger latitude of comparison.

'''Renewable energy commercialization''' involves the [[Diffusion of innovations|deployment]] of three generations of [[renewable energy]] technologies dating back more than 100 years. First-generation technologies, which are already mature and economically competitive, include [[biomass]], [[hydroelectricity]], [[geothermal power]] and heat. Second-generation technologies are market-ready and are being deployed at the present time; they include [[solar heating]], [[photovoltaics]], [[wind power]], [[List of solar thermal power stations|solar thermal power stations]], and modern forms of [[bioenergy]]. Third-generation technologies require continued [[R&amp;D]] efforts in order to make large contributions on a global scale and include advanced [[biomass gasification]], [[hot-dry-rock]] geothermal power, and [[ocean energy]].&lt;ref name="IEA"&gt;[[International Energy Agency]] (2007).

=== Rationale for renewables ===
[[Climate change]], pollution, and energy insecurity are significant problems, and addressing them requires major changes to energy infrastructures.&lt;ref name=WWS2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/JDEnPolicyPt1.pdf
|title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part I: Technologies, Energy Resources, Quantities and Areas of Infrastructure, and Materials |author1=Jacobson, Mark Z.  |author2=Delucchi, Mark A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010 |work=Energy Policy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Renewable energy]] technologies are essential contributors to the energy supply portfolio, as they contribute to [[energy security|world energy security]], reduce dependency on [[fossil fuel]]s, and provide opportunities for mitigating [[greenhouse gases]].&lt;ref name="IEA" /&gt; Climate-disrupting [[fossil fuels]] are being replaced by clean, climate-stabilizing, non-depletable sources of energy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{clear}}
...the transition from coal, oil, and gas to wind, solar, and geothermal energy is well under way. In the old economy, energy was produced by burning something — oil, coal, or natural gas — leading to the carbon emissions that have come to define our economy. The new energy economy harnesses the energy in wind, the energy coming from the sun, and heat from within the earth itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lester R. Brown]]. ''Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization'', [[Earth Policy Institute]], 2009, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In international public opinion surveys there is strong support for a variety of methods for addressing the problem of energy supply. These methods include promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power, requiring utilities to use more renewable energy, and providing tax incentives to encourage the development and use of such technologies. It is expected that renewable energy investments will pay off economically in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/public_opinion |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160517214450/http://www.cfr.org/public_opinion |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 May 2016 |title=Public Opinion on Global Issues: Chapter 5b: World Opinion on Energy Security |author=[[Council on Foreign Relations]] |date=18 January 2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EU member countries have shown support for ambitious renewable energy goals. In 2010, [[Eurobarometer]] polled the twenty-seven EU member states about the target "to increase the share of renewable energy in the EU by 20 percent by 2020". Most people in all twenty-seven countries either approved of the target or called for it to go further. Across the EU, 57 percent thought the proposed goal was "about right" and 16 percent thought it was "too modest." In comparison, 19 percent said it was "too ambitious".&lt;ref name="worldpublicopinion.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/btenvironmentra/707.php |title=Large Majorities in US and Europe Endorse Focus on Renewable Energy |date=18 January 2012 |work=World Public Opinion |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315003300/http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/btenvironmentra/707.php |archivedate=15 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, new evidence has emerged that there are considerable risks associated with traditional energy sources, and that major changes to the mix of energy technologies is needed: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Several mining tragedies globally have underscored the human toll of the coal supply chain. New EPA initiatives targeting air toxics, coal ash, and effluent releases highlight the environmental impacts of coal and the cost of addressing them with control technologies. The use of fracking in natural gas exploration is coming under scrutiny, with evidence of groundwater contamination and greenhouse gas emissions. Concerns are increasing about the vast amounts of water used at coal-fired and nuclear power plants, particularly in regions of the country facing water shortages. Events at the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster|Fukushima nuclear plant]] have renewed doubts about the ability to operate large numbers of nuclear plants safely over the long term. Further, cost estimates for "next generation" nuclear units continue to climb, and lenders are unwilling to finance these plants without taxpayer guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilsocietyinstitute.org/media/pdfs/Toward%20a%20Sustainable%20Future%2011-16-11.pdf |title=Toward a Sustainable Future for the U.S. Power Sector: Beyond Business as Usual 2011 |author=Synapse Energy Economics |date=16 November 2011 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 2014 [[REN21]] Global Status Report says that renewable energies are no longer just energy sources, but ways to address pressing social, political, economic and environmental problems:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Today, renewables are seen not only as sources of energy, but also as tools to address many other pressing needs, including: improving energy security; reducing the health and environmental impacts associated with fossil and nuclear energy; mitigating greenhouse gas emissions; improving educational opportunities; creating jobs; reducing poverty; and increasing gender equality... Renewables have entered the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf  |title= Renewables 2014 Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |date=2014 |work=(Paris: REN21 Secretariat) |isbn=978-3-9815934-2-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth of renewables===

In 2008 for the first time, more renewable energy than conventional power capacity was added in both the European Union and United States, demonstrating a "fundamental transition" of the world's energy markets towards renewables, according to a report released by [[REN21]], a global renewable energy policy network based in Paris.&lt;ref name=Mart/&gt; In 2010, renewable power consisted about a third of the newly built power generation capacities.&lt;ref name="UNEP_GT_2011_Fig24"&gt;[http://www.fs-unep-centre.org/publications/global-trends-renewable-energy-investment-2011 UNEP, Bloomberg, Frankfurt School, Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101180801/http://fs-unep-centre.org/publications/global-trends-renewable-energy-investment-2011 |date=1 November 2011 }}、Figure 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2011, total renewable power capacity worldwide exceeded 1,360 GW, up 8%. Renewables producing electricity accounted for almost half of the 208 GW of capacity added globally during 2011. Wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) accounted for almost 40% and 30% .&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.map.ren21.net/GSR/GSR2012.pdf  Renewables 2012 Global status report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215215616/http://www.map.ren21.net/GSR/GSR2012.pdf |date=15 December 2012 }} Executive summary REN21&lt;/ref&gt; Based on [[REN21]]'s 2014 report, renewables contributed 19 percent to our energy consumption and 22 percent to our electricity generation in 2012 and 2013, respectively. This energy consumption is divided as 9% coming from traditional biomass, 4.2% as heat energy (non-biomass), 3.8% hydro electricity and 2% electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass.&lt;ref name="ria21-GSR2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |title=Renewables 2014: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SKF06GAX?url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |archivedate=4 September 2014 |year=2014 |pages=13, 17, 21, 25 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the five-years from the end of 2004 through 2009, worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10–60 percent annually for many technologies, while actual production grew 1.2% overall.&lt;ref&gt;http://fs-unep-centre.org/sites/default/files/media/sefi2011finallowres.pdf pg25graph&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ren15&gt;[[REN21]] (2010).

The combination of government target-setting, policy support and stimulus funds is underpinning the renewable industry's rise and bringing the much needed transformation of our global energy system within reach." He added: "Renewable energies are expanding both in terms of investment, projects and geographical spread. In doing so, they are making an increasing contribution to combating climate change, countering energy poverty and energy insecurity".&lt;ref name=invest2011/&gt;

According to a 2011 projection by the International Energy Agency, solar power plants may produce most of the world's electricity within 50 years, significantly reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment. The IEA has said: "Photovoltaic and solar-thermal plants may meet most of the world's demand for electricity by 2060 – and half of all energy needs – with wind, hydropower and biomass plants supplying much of the remaining generation". "Photovoltaic and concentrated solar power together can become the major source of electricity".&lt;ref name="ieaiea2011"/&gt;

In 2013, China led the world in [[renewable energy]] production, with a total capacity of 378 [[Gigawatt|GW]], mainly from [[hydroelectric]] and [[wind power]]. As of 2014, China leads the world in the production and use of wind power, [[solar power|solar photovoltaic power]] and [[smart grid]] technologies, generating almost as much water, wind and [[solar energy]] as all of France and Germany's power plants combined. China's renewable energy sector is growing faster than its [[fossil fuels]] and [[nuclear power]] capacity. Since 2005, production of [[solar cells]] in China has expanded 100-fold. As Chinese renewable manufacturing has grown, the costs of renewable energy technologies have dropped. Innovation has helped, but the main driver of reduced costs has been market expansion.&lt;ref name=chinaen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/economics-manufacture-renewables-to-build-energy-security-1.15847 |title=Economics: Manufacture renewables to build energy security |author1=John A.

===Economic trends===
[[File:US projected cost of wind power.png|thumb|The [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] projects that the levelized cost of wind power will decline about 25% from 2012 to 2030.&lt;ref name=review&gt;E. Lantz, M. Hand, and R. Wiser ( 13–17 May 2012) [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/54526.pdf "The Past and Future Cost of Wind Energy,"] National Renewable Energy Laboratory conference paper no. 6A20-54526, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Renewable energy technologies are getting cheaper, through technological change and through the benefits of mass production and market competition. A 2011 IEA report said: "A portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances, in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support," and added that "cost reductions in critical technologies, such as wind and solar, are set to continue."&lt;ref name=henning&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/23/us-energy-iea-renewables-idUSTRE7AM0OV20111123 |title=Renewable energy becoming cost competitive, IEA says |author=Henning Gloystein |date=23 November 2011  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011}}, there have been substantial reductions in the cost of solar and wind technologies:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{clear}}
The price of PV modules per MW has fallen by 60 percent since the summer of 2008, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates, putting solar power for the first time on a competitive footing with the retail price of electricity in a number of sunny countries. Wind turbine prices have also fallen – by 18 percent per MW in the last two years – reflecting, as with solar, fierce competition in the supply chain. Further improvements in the levelised cost of energy for solar, wind and other technologies lie ahead, posing a growing threat to the dominance of fossil fuel generation sources in the next few years.&lt;ref name=invest2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/08/renewables-investment-breaks-records |title=Renewables Investment Breaks Records |date=29 August 2011 |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hydro-electricity and geothermal electricity produced at favourable sites are now the cheapest way to generate electricity. Renewable energy costs continue to drop, and the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) is declining for wind power, solar photovoltaic (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP) and some biomass technologies.&lt;ref name=irena111&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/Overview_Renewable%20Power%20Generation%20Costs%20in%202012.pdf |title=Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2012: An Overview |author=International Renewable Energy Agency |year=2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Renewable energy is also the most economic solution for new grid-connected capacity in areas with good resources. As the cost of renewable power falls, the scope of economically viable applications increases. Renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity. Where "oil-fired generation is the predominant power generation source (e.g. on islands, off-grid and in some countries) a lower-cost renewable solution almost always exists today".&lt;ref name=irena111/&gt; As of 2012, renewable power generation technologies accounted for around half of all new power generation capacity additions globally. In 2011, additions included 41 [[gigawatt]] (GW) of new wind power capacity, 30 GW of PV, 25 GW of hydro-electricity, 6 GW of biomass, 0.5 GW of CSP, and 0.1 GW of geothermal power.&lt;ref name=irena111/&gt;

=== Three generations of technologies ===
Renewable energy includes a number of sources and technologies at different stages of commercialization. The [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) has defined three generations of renewable energy technologies, reaching back over 100&amp;nbsp;years:

*"''First-generation technologies'' emerged from the [[industrial revolution]] at the end of the 19th century and include [[hydropower]], [[biomass]] [[combustion]], [[geothermal power]] and heat. These technologies are quite widely used.&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt;
*''Second-generation technologies'' include [[solar heating]] and cooling, [[wind power]], modern forms of [[bioenergy]], and [[solar photovoltaics]]. These are now entering markets as a result of research, development and demonstration (RD&amp;D) investments since the 1980s. Initial investment was prompted by [[energy security]] concerns linked to the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crises]] of the 1970s but the enduring appeal of these technologies is due, at least in part, to environmental benefits. Many of the technologies reflect significant advancements in materials.&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt;
*''Third-generation technologies'' are still under development and include advanced [[biomass gasification]], [[biorefinery]] technologies, concentrating [[solar thermal]] power, [[hot-dry-rock]] geothermal power, and [[ocean energy]]. Advances in [[nanotechnology]] may also play a major role".&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt; First-generation technologies are well established, second-generation technologies are entering markets, and third-generation technologies heavily depend on long-term research and development commitments, where the public sector has a role to play.&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt;

== First-generation technologies ==
[[File:Biomasseheizwerk Spillern Nordansicht.jpg|thumb|rechts|Biomass heating plant in Austria. The total heat power is about 1000 kW.]]

First-generation technologies are widely used in locations with abundant resources. Their future use depends on the exploration of the remaining resource potential, particularly in developing countries, and on overcoming challenges related to the environment and social acceptance.

=== Biomass ===

[[Biomass]] for heat and power is a fully [[mature technology]] which offers a ready disposal mechanism for municipal, agricultural, and industrial organic wastes. However, the industry has remained relatively stagnant over the decade to 2007, even though demand for biomass (mostly wood) continues to grow in many developing countries. One of the problems of biomass is that material directly combusted in cook stoves produces pollutants, leading to severe health and environmental consequences, although improved cook stove programmes are alleviating some of these effects. First-generation biomass technologies can be economically competitive, but may still require deployment support to overcome public acceptance and small-scale issues.&lt;ref name="IEA" /&gt;

=== Hydroelectricity ===
[[File:ThreeGorgesDam-China2009.jpg|thumb| The 22,500 [[Megawatt|MW]] [[Three Gorges Dam]] in the [[People's Republic of China]], the largest hydroelectric power station in the world.]]
[[Hydroelectricity]] is the term referring to electricity generated by [[hydropower]]; the production of electrical power through the use of the gravitational force of falling or flowing water. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and is expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years. [[Hydroelectric]] plants have the advantage of being long-lived and many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years.

Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10 GW: the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China, [[Itaipu Dam]] across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and [[Guri Dam]] in Venezuela.&lt;ref name=wi2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |title=Use and Capacity of Global Hydropower Increases |author=Worldwatch Institute |date=January 2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of hydroelectricity is low, making it a competitive source of renewable electricity. The average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt;

=== Geothermal power and heat ===
[[File:West Ford Flat Geothermal Cooling Tower.JPG|thumb|right|West Ford Flat Geothermal Cooling Tower.JPG|thumb|One of many power plants at [[The Geysers]], a geothermal power field in northern California, with a total output of over 750&amp;nbsp;MW]]

[[Geothermal power]] plants can operate 24&amp;nbsp;hours per day, providing [[baseload]] capacity. Estimates for the world potential capacity for geothermal power generation vary widely, ranging from 40 GW by 2020 to as much as 6,000 GW.&lt;ref&gt;

In: O. Hohmeyer and T. Trittin (Eds.), IPCC Scoping Meeting on Renewable Energy Sources, Proceedings, Luebeck, Germany, 20–25 January 2008, p. 59-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geothermal power capacity grew from around 1 GW in 1975 to almost 10 GW in 2008.&lt;ref name="IPCC Geothermal 2008"/&gt; The United States is the world leader in terms of installed capacity, representing 3.1 GW. Other countries with significant installed capacity include the Philippines (1.9 GW), Indonesia (1.2 GW), Mexico (1.0 GW), Italy (0.8 GW), Iceland (0.6 GW), Japan (0.5 GW), and New Zealand (0.5 GW).&lt;ref name="IPCC Geothermal 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, geothermal power accounts for a significant share of the total electricity supply, such as in the Philippines, where geothermal represented 17 percent of the total power mix at the end of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

Leonora Walet. [https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-GreenBusiness/idUSTRE5A43HC20091105 Philippines targets $2.5 billion geothermal development], ''Reuters'', 5 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geothermal (ground source) heat pumps represented an estimated 30 GWth of installed capacity at the end of 2008, with other direct uses of geothermal heat (i.e., for space heating, agricultural drying and other uses) reaching an estimated 15 GWth. {{As of|2008}}, at least 76 countries use direct geothermal energy in some form.&lt;ref name=renewables/&gt;

== Second-generation technologies ==

Second-generation technologies have gone from being a passion for the dedicated few to a major economic sector in countries such as Germany, Spain, the United States, and Japan. Many large industrial companies and financial institutions are involved and the challenge is to broaden the market base for continued growth worldwide.&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNEP2 /&gt;

=== Solar heating ===
[[File:Solar heater dsc00632.jpg|thumb|Solar energy technologies, such as [[solar water heater]]s, located on or near the buildings which they supply with energy, are a prime example of a [[soft energy technology]].]]
{{See also|Solar hot water}}

[[Solar heating]] systems are a well known second-generation technology and generally consist of [[solar thermal collector]]s, a fluid system to move the heat from the collector to its point of usage, and a reservoir or tank for heat storage. The systems may be used to heat domestic hot water, swimming pools, or homes and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Norton (2011) Solar Water Heaters: A Review of Systems Research and Design Innovation, Green. 1, 189–207, ISSN (Online) 1869–8778&lt;/ref&gt; The heat can also be used for industrial process applications or as an energy input for other uses such as cooling equipment.&lt;ref&gt;International Energy Agency. [http://www.iea-shc.org/task25/index.html Solar assisted air-conditioning of buildings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105091415/http://www.iea-shc.org/task25/index.html |date=5 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many warmer climates, a solar heating system can provide a very high percentage (50 to 75%) of domestic hot water energy. {{As of|2009}}, China has 27 million rooftop solar water heaters.&lt;ref&gt;Lester R. Brown. ''Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization'', Earth Policy Institute, 2009, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Photovoltaics ===

{{Main article|Photovoltaics|List of photovoltaic power stations}}
[[File:Solar-crop.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] speaks at the [[DeSoto Next Generation Solar Energy Center]].]]

Photovoltaic (PV) cells, also called [[solar cell]]s, convert light into electricity. In the 1980s and early 1990s, most photovoltaic modules were used to provide [[remote-area power supply]], but from around 1995, industry efforts have focused increasingly on developing [[building integrated photovoltaics]] and [[photovoltaic power station]]s for grid connected applications.

Many solar [[photovoltaic power station]]s have been built, mainly in Europe.&lt;ref name="PV"&gt;Denis Lenardic. [http://www.pvresources.com/en/top50pv.php Large-scale photovoltaic power plants ranking 1 – 50] ''PVresources.com'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2012, the largest photovoltaic (PV) power plants in the world are the [[Agua Caliente Solar Project]] (USA, 247 MW)&lt;!--possibly AC--&gt;, [[Charanka Solar Park]] (India, 214 MW), [[Golmud Solar Park]] (China, 200 MW), [[Perovo Solar Park]] (Russia 100 MW), [[Sarnia Photovoltaic Power Plant]] (Canada, 97 MW), [[Brandenburg-Briest Solarpark]] (Germany 91 MW), [[Solarpark Finow Tower]] (Germany 84.7 MW), [[Montalto di Castro Photovoltaic Power Station]] (Italy, 84.2 MW), [[Eggebek Solar Park]] (Germany 83.6 MW), [[Senftenberg Solarpark]] (Germany 82 MW), [[Finsterwalde Solar Park]] (Germany, 80.7 MW), [[Okhotnykovo Solar Park]] (Russia, 80&amp;nbsp;MW), [[Lopburi Solar Farm]] (Thailand 73.16 MW), [[Rovigo Photovoltaic Power Plant]] (Italy, 72 MW), and the [[Lieberose Photovoltaic Park]] (Germany, 71.8&amp;nbsp;MW).&lt;ref name="PV"/&gt;

There are also many large plants under construction. The [[Desert Sunlight Solar Farm]] under construction in [[Riverside County, California]] and [[Topaz Solar Farm]] being built in [[San Luis Obispo County, California]] are both 550 [[megawatt|MW]] [[solar park]]s that will use thin-film solar [[photovoltaic]] modules made by [[First Solar]].&lt;ref name=rew11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/09/doe-closes-on-three-major-solar-projects |title=DOE Closes on Four Major Solar Projects  |date= 30 September 2011 |work= Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Blythe Solar Power Project]] is a 500 MW photovoltaic station under construction in [[Riverside County, California]].

As of 2014, the wind industry in the USA is able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300 feet to 400 feet above the ground can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/21/business/energy-environment/wind-industrys-new-technologies-are-helping-it-compete-on-price.html?_r=0 |title=Wind Industry's New Technologies Are Helping It Compete on Price |author=Diane Cardwell |date=20 March 2014 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solar thermal power]] stations include the 354&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt]] (MW) [[Solar Energy Generating Systems]] power plant in the USA, [[Solnova Solar Power Station]] (Spain, 150&amp;nbsp;MW), [[Andasol solar power station]] (Spain, 100&amp;nbsp;MW), [[Nevada Solar One]] (USA, 64&amp;nbsp;MW), [[PS20 solar power tower]] (Spain, 20&amp;nbsp;MW), and the [[PS10 solar power tower]] (Spain, 11&amp;nbsp;MW). The 370 MW [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]], located in California's [[Mojave Desert]], is the world's largest solar-thermal power plant project currently under construction.&lt;ref name=woody&gt;

=== Modern forms of bioenergy ===
{{See also|Biofuels|Sustainable biofuel}}
[[File:Sao Paulo ethanol pump 04 2008 74 zoom.jpg|thumb|left|[[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E100|Neat ethanol]] on the left (A), gasoline on the right (G) at a [[filling station]] in Brazil.]]

Global [[ethanol]] production for transport fuel tripled between 2000 and 2007 from 17&amp;nbsp;billion to more than 52&amp;nbsp;billion litres, while [[biodiesel]] expanded more than tenfold from less than 1&amp;nbsp;billion to almost 11&amp;nbsp;billion litres. Biofuels provide 1.8% of the world's transport fuel and recent estimates indicate a continued high growth. The main producing countries for transport biofuels are the USA, Brazil, and the EU.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Environment Programme (2009). ''[http://www.unep.fr/scp/rpanel/pdf/Assessing_Biofuels_Full_Report.pdf Assessing Biofuels] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122133933/http://www.unep.fr/scp/rpanel/pdf/Assessing_Biofuels_Full_Report.pdf |date=22 November 2009 }}'', p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brazil]] has one of the largest renewable energy programs in the world, involving production of [[ethanol fuel]] from [[sugar cane]], and ethanol now provides 18 percent of the country's automotive fuel. As a result of this and the exploitation of domestic deep water oil sources, Brazil, which for years had to import a large share of the petroleum needed for domestic consumption, recently reached complete self-sufficiency in liquid fuels.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:EthanolPetrol.jpg|right|thumb|Information on pump, California]]

Nearly all the gasoline sold in the United States today is mixed with 10 percent ethanol, a mix known as E10,&lt;ref&gt;

Erica Gies. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/25/business/energy-environment/25iht-rbogeth.html?src=busln As Ethanol Booms, Critics Warn of Environmental Effect] ''The New York Times'', 24 June 2010.

&lt;/ref&gt; and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends. [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[DaimlerChrysler]], and [[General Motors Corporation|GM]] are among the automobile companies that sell [[flexible-fuel]] cars, trucks, and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85% ethanol (E85). The challenge is to expand the market for biofuels beyond the farm states where they have been most popular to date. The [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]], which calls for {{convert|7.5|e9USgal|m3}} of biofuels to be used annually by 2012, will also help to expand the market.&lt;ref name="world"&gt;Worldwatch Institute and Center for American Progress (2006). [http://images1.americanprogress.org/il80web20037/americanenergynow/AmericanEnergy.pdf ''American energy: The renewable path to energy security'' (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing ethanol and biodiesel industries are providing jobs in plant construction, operations, and maintenance, mostly in rural communities. According to the Renewable Fuels Association, "the ethanol industry created almost 154,000 U.S. jobs in 2005 alone, boosting household income by $5.7&amp;nbsp;billion. It also contributed about $3.5&amp;nbsp;billion in tax revenues at the local, state, and federal levels".&lt;ref name="world" /&gt;

== Third-generation technologies ==

Third-generation renewable energy technologies are still under development and include advanced [[biomass gasification]], [[biorefinery]] technologies, [[hot-dry-rock]] geothermal power, and [[ocean energy]]. Third-generation technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization. Many are on the horizon and may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies, but still depend on attracting sufficient attention and research and development funding.&lt;ref name="IEA" /&gt;

According to the International Energy Agency, [[cellulosic ethanol]] biorefineries could allow biofuels to play a much bigger role in the future than organizations such as the IEA previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;

International Energy Agency (2006). [http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2006/weo2006.pdf ''World Energy Outlook 2006'' (PDF)].

&lt;/ref&gt; Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Crop residues (such as [[Corn stover|corn stalks]], wheat straw and rice straw), wood waste, and [[municipal solid waste]] are potential sources of cellulosic biomass. Dedicated energy crops, such as [[Panicum virgatum|switchgrass]], are also promising cellulose sources that can be [[Sustainable biofuel|sustainably produced]] in many regions.&lt;ref&gt;Biotechnology Industry Organization (2007).

=== Ocean energy ===

[[Ocean energy]] is all forms of renewable energy derived from the sea including wave energy, tidal energy, river current, ocean current energy, offshore wind, salinity gradient energy and ocean thermal gradient energy.&lt;ref name=OE1&gt;[http://oceanenergy.epri.com/ ''Ocean energy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031162616/http://oceanenergy.epri.com/ |date=31 October 2012 }} EPRI Ocean Energy Web Page&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rance Tidal Power Station]] (240 MW) is the world's first [[tidal power|tidal]] power station. The facility is located on the estuary of the [[Rance River]], in [[Brittany]], France. Opened on 26 November 1966, it is currently operated by [[Électricité de France]], and is the largest tidal power station in the world, in terms of installed capacity.

First proposed more than thirty years ago, systems to harvest utility-scale electrical power from ocean waves have recently been gaining momentum as a viable technology. The potential for this technology is considered promising, especially on west-facing coasts with latitudes between 40 and 60 degrees:&lt;ref name=je&gt;Jeff Scruggs and Paul Jacob. Harvesting Ocean Wave Energy, ''Science'', Vol. 323, 27 February 2009, p. 1176.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the United Kingdom, for example, the Carbon Trust recently estimated the extent of the economically viable offshore resource at 55 TWh per year, about 14% of current national demand. Across Europe, the technologically achievable resource has been estimated to be at least 280 TWh per year. In 2003, the U.S. Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) estimated the viable resource in the United States at 255 TWh per year (6% of demand).&lt;ref name=je/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There are currently nine projects, completed or in-development, off the coasts of the United Kingdom, United States, Spain and Australia to harness the rise and fall of waves by [[Ocean Power Technologies]]. The current maximum power output is 1.5 MW ([[Reedsport, Oregon]]), with development underway for 100 MW ([[Coos Bay, Oregon]]).&lt;ref name=OPT&gt;[http://www.oceanpowertechnologies.com/projects.html ''Projects''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401203800/http://www.oceanpowertechnologies.com/projects.html |date=1 April 2012 }} Ocean Power Technologies Projects&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enhanced geothermal systems ===

{{As of|2008}}, geothermal power development was under way in more than 40 countries, partially attributable to the development of new technologies, such as Enhanced Geothermal Systems.&lt;ref name=renewables&gt;[[REN21]] (2009). [http://www.ren21.net/pdf/RE_GSR_2009_update.pdf Renewables Global Status Report: 2009 Update] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612132038/http://www.ren21.net/pdf/RE_GSR_2009_update.pdf |date=12 June 2009 }} pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of [[binary cycle power plant]]s and improvements in drilling and extraction technology may enable [[enhanced geothermal systems]] over a much greater geographical range than "traditional" Geothermal systems. Demonstration EGS projects are operational in the USA, Australia, Germany, France, and The United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Advanced solar concepts ===
Beyond the already established [[solar photovoltaics]] and solar thermal power technologies are such advanced solar concepts as the solar updraft tower or space-based solar power. These concepts have yet to (if ever) be commercialized.  
{{See also|Solar updraft tower}}
The Solar updraft tower (SUT) is a [[Renewable energy|renewable-energy]] [[power plant]] for generating electricity from low temperature solar heat. Sunshine heats the air beneath a very wide greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall [[chimney]] tower. The resulting [[convection]] causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the [[chimney effect]]. This airflow drives [[wind turbine]]s placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to produce [[electricity]]. Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation, and may allow development of other applications, such as water extraction or distillation, and agriculture or horticulture.

A more advanced version of a similarly themed technology is the [[Vortex engine]] (AVE) which aims to replace large physical chimneys with a [[vortex]] of air created by a shorter, less-expensive structure.
{{See also|Space-based solar power}}
'''Space-based solar power''' ('''SBSP''') is the concept of collecting [[solar power]] in [[Outer space|space]] (using an "SPS", that is, a "solar-power satellite" or a "satellite power system") for use on [[Earth]]. It has been in research since the early 1970s. SBSP would differ from current [[Sun|solar]] collection methods in that the means used to collect [[energy]] would reside on an [[orbit]]ing [[satellite]] instead of on Earth's surface. Some projected benefits of such a system are a higher collection rate and a longer collection period due to the lack of a diffusing [[atmosphere]] and night [[time]] in [[space]].

The PV industry has seen drops in module prices since 2008. In late 2011, factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the $1.00/W mark. The $1.00/W installed cost, is often regarded in the PV industry as marking the achievement of [[grid parity]] for PV. These reductions have taken many stakeholders, including industry analysts, by surprise, and perceptions of current solar power economics often lags behind reality. Some stakeholders still have the perspective that solar PV remains too costly on an unsubsidized basis to compete with conventional generation options. Yet technological advancements, manufacturing process improvements, and industry re-structuring, mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years.&lt;ref name=reconsidering&gt;{{cite web |url= http://az2112.com/assets/energy-bnef_re_considering_the_economics_of_photovoltaic_power_a_co_authored_white.pdf |title= Re-considering the economics of photovoltaic power |author1=M Bazilian |author2=I Onyeji |author3=M Liebreich |author4=I MacGill |author5=J Chase |author6=J Shah |author7=D Gielen... |date=  2013 |work=Renewable Energy (53) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-technical barriers to acceptance ==
Many energy markets, institutions, and policies have been developed to support the production and use of fossil fuels.&lt;ref name=jacob2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/DJEnPolicyPt2.pdf |title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part II: Reliability, System and Transmission Costs, and Policies |author=Delucchi, Mark A. and [[Mark Z. Jacobson]]  |year=2010 |work=Energy Policy }}

&lt;/ref&gt; Newer and cleaner technologies may offer social and environmental benefits, but utility operators often reject renewable resources because they are trained to think only in terms of big, conventional power plants.&lt;ref name=epsov/&gt; Consumers often ignore renewable power systems because they are not given accurate price signals about electricity consumption. Intentional market distortions (such as subsidies), and unintentional market distortions (such as split incentives) may work against renewables.&lt;ref name=epsov&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool. "Rejecting Renewables: The Socio-technical Impediments to Renewable Electricity in the United States," ''Energy Policy'', 37(11) (November 2009), p. 4500.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] has argued that "some of the most surreptitious, yet powerful, impediments facing renewable energy and energy efficiency in the United States are more about ''culture'' and ''institutions'' than engineering and science".&lt;ref&gt;
Benjamin K. Sovacool. "The Cultural Barriers to Renewable Energy in the United States," ''Technology in Society'', 31(4) (November 2009), p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

The obstacles to the widespread commercialization of renewable energy technologies are primarily political, not technical,&lt;ref&gt;
Mark Z. Jacobson and Mark A. Delucchi. A Path to Sustainable Energy by 2030, ''Scientific American'', November 2009, p. 45.
&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been many studies which have identified a range of "non-technical barriers" to renewable energy use.&lt;ref name=ieapress/&gt;&lt;ref name="NREL"&gt;[[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (2006). ''Nontechnical Barriers to Solar Energy Use: Review of Recent Literature'', Technical Report, NREL/TP-520-40116, September, 30 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GREMS&gt;
United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, (2005). [http://www.ppre.uni-oldenburg.de/download/Downloads/Global_RE-Report-2005.pdf Increasing Global Renewable Energy Market Share: Recent Trends and Perspectives] Final Report.&lt;/ref&gt; These barriers are impediments which put renewable energy at a marketing, institutional, or policy disadvantage relative to other forms of energy. Key barriers include:&lt;ref name="NREL" /&gt;&lt;ref name=GREMS /&gt;

* Difficulty overcoming established energy systems, which includes difficulty introducing innovative energy systems, particularly for [[distributed generation]] such as photovoltaics, because of technological lock-in, electricity markets designed for centralized power plants, and market control by established operators. As the [[Stern Review|Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change]] points out:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"National grids are usually tailored towards the operation of centralised power plants and thus favour their performance. Technologies that do not easily fit into these networks may struggle to enter the market, even if the technology itself is commercially viable. This applies to distributed generation as most grids are not suited to receive electricity from many small sources. Large-scale renewables may also encounter problems if they are sited in areas far from existing grids."&lt;ref name=Stern2&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

HM Treasury (2006). [http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/stern_review_report.cfm ''Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change''] p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Lack of government policy support, which includes the lack of policies and regulations supporting deployment of renewable energy technologies and the presence of policies and regulations hindering renewable energy development and supporting conventional energy development. Examples include [[fossil fuel subsidies|subsidies for fossil-fuels]], insufficient consumer-based [[renewable energy incentives]], government underwriting for nuclear plant accidents, and complex zoning and permitting processes for renewable energy.
* Lack of information dissemination and consumer awareness.
* Higher capital cost of renewable energy technologies compared with conventional energy technologies.
* Inadequate financing options for renewable energy projects, including insufficient access to affordable financing for project developers, entrepreneurs and consumers.
* Imperfect capital markets, which includes failure to internalize all costs of conventional energy (e.g., effects of air pollution, risk of supply disruption)&lt;ref&gt;Matthew L. Wald.
[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/science/earth/20fossil.html Fossil Fuels’ Hidden Cost Is in Billions, Study Says] ''The New York Times'', 20 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and failure to internalize all benefits of renewable energy (e.g., cleaner air, energy security).
* Inadequate workforce skills and training, which includes lack of adequate scientific, technical, and manufacturing skills required for renewable energy production; lack of reliable installation, maintenance, and inspection services; and failure of the educational system to provide adequate training in new technologies.
* Lack of adequate codes, standards, utility interconnection, and net-metering guidelines.
* Poor public perception of renewable energy system aesthetics.
* Lack of stakeholder/community participation and co-operation in energy choices and renewable energy projects.

With such a wide range of non-technical barriers, there is no "silver bullet" solution to drive the transition to renewable energy. So ideally there is a need for several different types of policy instruments to complement each other and overcome different types of barriers.&lt;ref name=GREMS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

A policy framework must be created that will level the playing field and redress the imbalance of traditional approaches associated with fossil fuels. The policy landscape must keep pace with broad trends within the energy sector, as well as reflecting specific social, economic and environmental priorities.&lt;ref&gt;IEA Renewable Energy Working Party (2002). ''Renewable Energy... into the mainstream'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Some resource-rich countries struggle to move away from fossil fuels and have failed thus far to adopt regulatory frameworks necessary for developing renewable energy (e.g. Russia).&lt;ref&gt;Indra Overland, ‘The Siberian Curse: A Blessing in Disguise for Renewable Energy?’, Sibirica Journal of Siberian Studies, Vol. 9, No. 2, pp. 1-20. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263524693&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public policy landscape ==
Public policy has a role to play in renewable energy commercialization because the free market system has some fundamental limitations. As the [[Stern Review]] points out:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In a liberalised energy market, investors, operators and consumers should face the full cost of their decisions. But this is not the case in many economies or energy sectors. Many policies distort the market in favour of existing fossil fuel technologies.&lt;ref name=Stern2 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[International Solar Energy Society]] has stated that "historical incentives for the conventional energy resources continue even today to bias markets by burying many of the real societal costs of their use".&lt;ref&gt;Donald W. Aitken. [http://www.renewableenergyfocus.com/downloads/ Transitioning to a Renewable Energy Future], [[International Solar Energy Society]], January 2010, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fossil-fuel energy systems have different production, transmission, and end-use costs and characteristics than do renewable energy systems, and new promotional policies are needed to ensure that renewable systems develop as quickly and broadly as is socially desirable.&lt;ref name=jacob2010/&gt;

[[Lester Brown]] states that the market "does not incorporate the indirect costs of providing goods or services into prices, it does not value nature's services adequately, and it does not respect the sustainable-yield thresholds of natural systems".&lt;ref name="Br" /&gt; It also favors the near term over the long term, thereby showing limited concern for future generations.&lt;ref name="Br"&gt;

=== Shifting taxes ===
Tax shifting has been widely discussed and endorsed by economists. It involves lowering income taxes while raising levies on environmentally destructive activities, in order to create a more responsive market. For example, a tax on coal that included the increased health care costs associated with breathing polluted air, the costs of acid rain damage, and the costs of climate disruption would encourage investment in renewable technologies. Several Western European countries are already shifting taxes in a process known there as environmental tax reform.&lt;ref name="Br" /&gt;

In 2001, Sweden launched a new 10-year environmental tax shift designed to convert 30&amp;nbsp;billion kroner ($3.9&amp;nbsp;billion) of income taxes to taxes on environmentally destructive activities. Other European countries with significant tax reform efforts are France, Italy, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Asia's two leading economies, Japan and China, are considering carbon taxes.&lt;ref name="Br" /&gt;

=== Shifting subsidies ===
{{See also|Energy subsidies}}
Just as there is a need for tax shifting, there is also a need for subsidy shifting. Subsidies are not an inherently bad thing as many technologies and industries emerged through government subsidy schemes. The Stern Review explains that of 20 key innovations from the past 30&amp;nbsp;years, only one of the 14 was funded entirely by the private sector and nine were totally publicly funded.&lt;ref&gt;HM Treasury (2006). [http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/stern_review_report.cfm ''Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change''] p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of specific examples, the Internet was the result of publicly funded links among computers in government laboratories and research institutes. And the combination of the federal tax deduction and a robust state tax deduction in California helped to create the modern wind power industry.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

Lester Brown has argued that "a world facing the prospect of economically disruptive climate change can no longer justify subsidies to expand the burning of coal and oil. Shifting these subsidies to the development of climate-benign energy sources such as wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal power is the key to stabilizing the earth's climate."&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; The International Solar Energy Society advocates "leveling the playing field" by redressing the continuing inequities in public subsidies of energy technologies and R&amp;D, in which the fossil fuel and nuclear power receive the largest share of financial support.&lt;ref&gt;Donald W. Aitken. [http://www.renewableenergyfocus.com/downloads/ Transitioning to a Renewable Energy Future], [[International Solar Energy Society]], January 2010, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries are eliminating or reducing climate-disrupting subsidies and Belgium, France, and Japan have phased out all subsidies for coal. Germany is reducing its coal subsidy. The subsidy dropped from $5.4&amp;nbsp;billion in 1989 to $2.8&amp;nbsp;billion in 2002, and in the process Germany lowered its coal use by 46&amp;nbsp;percent. China cut its coal subsidy from $750&amp;nbsp;million in 1993 to $240&amp;nbsp;million in 1995 and more recently has imposed a high-sulfur coal tax.&lt;ref name="Brown"  /&gt; However, the United States has been increasing its support for the fossil fuel and nuclear industries.&lt;ref name="Brown"  /&gt;

In November 2011, an IEA report entitled ''[[Deploying Renewables 2011]]'' said "subsidies in green energy technologies that were not yet competitive are justified in order to give an incentive to investing into technologies with clear environmental and energy security benefits". The IEA's report disagreed with claims that renewable energy technologies are only viable through costly subsidies and not able to produce energy reliably to meet demand.&lt;ref name="henning"/&gt;

A fair and efficient imposition of subsidies for renewable energies and aiming at sustainable development, however, require coordination and regulation at a global level, as subsidies granted in one country can easily disrupt industries and policies of others, thus underlining the relevance of this issue at the World Trade Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|last2=Cima|first2=Elena|title=World Trade Organization, Renewable Energy Subsidies and the Case of Feed-In Tariffs: Time for Reform Toward Sustainable Development?|journal=Georgetown International Environmental Law Review (GIELR)|date=2015|volume= 27|issue= 1|ssrn=2704398|accessdate=}} and {{cite journal|title=WTO and Renewable Energy: Lessons from the Case Law|journal=49 JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE 6, Kluwer Law International|ssrn=2704453|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renewable energy targets ===
Setting national renewable energy targets can be an important part of a renewable energy policy and these targets are usually defined as a percentage of the primary energy and/or electricity generation mix. For example, the [[European Union]] has prescribed an indicative renewable energy target of 12 per cent of the total EU [[energy mix]] and 22 per cent of electricity consumption by 2010. National targets for individual EU Member States have also been set to meet the overall target. Other developed countries with defined national or regional targets include Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, and some US States.&lt;ref name=UNEP3&gt;United Nations Environment Program (2006).  [http://www.ren21.net/pdf/REN21CC%20rapport.pdf ''Changing climates: The Role of Renewable Energy in a Carbon-constrained World''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055332/http://www.ren21.net/pdf/REN21CC%20rapport.pdf |date=28 September 2007 }} pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

National targets are also an important component of renewable energy strategies in some [[developing countries]]. Developing countries with renewable energy targets include China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Brazil, Egypt, Mali, and South Africa. The targets set by many developing countries are quite modest when compared with those in some industrialized countries.&lt;ref name=UNEP3 /&gt;

Renewable energy targets in most countries are indicative and nonbinding but they have assisted government actions and regulatory frameworks. The United Nations Environment Program has suggested that making renewable energy targets legally binding could be an important policy tool to achieve higher renewable energy market penetration.&lt;ref name=UNEP3 /&gt;

===Levelling the playing field===
The IEA has identified three actions which will allow renewable energy and other clean energy technologies to "more effectively compete for private sector capital".
*"First, energy prices must appropriately reflect the "true cost" of energy (e.g. through carbon pricing) so that the positive and negative impacts of energy production and consumption are fully taken into account". Example: [[Hinkley Point C nuclear power station|New UK nuclear plants]] cost £92.50/MWh,&lt;ref name=bbcstrike&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24604218|title=UK nuclear power plant gets go-ahead|date=21 October 2013|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telestrike&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/10392510/Hinkley-Point-good-for-Britain-says-Ed-Davey.html|title=Hinkley Point nuclear power plant to create 25,000 jobs, says Cameron|date=21 October 2013|author1=Roland Gribben  |author2=Denise Roland |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher= Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas offshore wind farms in the UK are supported with €74.2/MWh&lt;ref&gt;Erin Gill.

Accessed: 22 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Second, inefficient fossil fuel subsidies must be removed, while ensuring that all citizens have access to affordable energy".
*"Third, governments must develop policy frameworks that encourage private sector investment in lower-carbon energy options".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/IEA%20Tracking%20Clean%20Energy%20Progress%20report%202012.pdf |title=Tracking Clean Energy Progress |author=IEA |year=2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Green stimulus programs ===
In response to the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|global financial crisis in the late 2000s]], the world's major governments made "green stimulus" programs one of their main policy instruments for supporting economic recovery. Some {{US$|188 billion}} in green stimulus funding had been allocated to renewable energy and energy efficiency, to be spent mainly in 2010 and in 2011.&lt;ref name=ren27&gt;[[REN21]] (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820221548/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf |date=20 August 2010 }} p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy sector regulation===
Public policy determines the extent to which renewable energy (RE) is to be incorporated into a developed or developing country's generation mix. Energy sector regulators implement that policy—thus affecting the pace and pattern of RE investments and connections to the grid. Energy regulators often have authority to carry out a number of functions that have implications for the financial feasibility of renewable energy projects. Such functions include issuing licenses, setting performance standards, monitoring the performance of regulated firms, determining the price level and structure of tariffs, establishing uniform systems of accounts, arbitrating stakeholder disputes (like interconnection cost allocations), performing management audits, developing agency human resources (expertise), reporting sector and commission activities to government authorities, and coordinating decisions with other government agencies. Thus, regulators make a wide range of decisions that affect the financial outcomes associated with RE investments. In addition, the sector regulator is in a position to give advice to the government regarding the full implications of focusing on climate change or energy security. The energy sector regulator is the natural advocate for efficiency and cost-containment throughout the process of designing and implementing RE policies. Since policies are not self-implementing, energy sector regulators become a key facilitator (or blocker) of renewable energy investments.&lt;ref name="PURC"&gt;Frequently Asked Questions on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, Body of Knowledge on Infrastructure Regulation, [http://regulationbodyofknowledge.org/renewable-energy-and-energy-efficiency/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany has made significant progress on its GHG emissions reduction target, achieving a 27% decrease between 1990 and 2014. However Germany will need to maintain an average GHG emissions abatement rate of 3.5% per annum to reach its ''Energiewende'' goal, equal to the maximum historical value thus far.&lt;ref name="hillebrandt-etal-2015"&gt;

These initiatives go well beyond [[European Union]] legislation and the national policies of other European states. The policy objectives have been embraced by the German federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables, particularly wind power. Germany's share of renewables has increased from around 5% in 1999 to 22.9% in 2012, surpassing the OECD average of 18% usage of renewables.&lt;ref name="economist-2012"&gt;

Producers have been guaranteed a fixed [[feed-in tariff]] for 20 years, guaranteeing a fixed income. Energy co-operatives have been created, and efforts were made to decentralize control and profits. The large energy companies have a disproportionately small share of the renewables market. However, in some cases poor investment designs have caused bankruptcies and low [[Return on investment|returns]], and unrealistic promises have been shown to be far from reality.&lt;ref name="latsch-etal-2014"&gt;

Nuclear power plants were closed, and the existing nine plants will close earlier than planned, in 2022.

One factor that has inhibited efficient employment of new renewable energy has been the lack of an accompanying investment in power infrastructure to bring the power to market. It is believed 8,300&amp;nbsp;km of power lines must be built or upgraded.&lt;ref name="economist-2012"/&gt; The different [[States of Germany|German States]] have varying attitudes to the construction of new power lines. Industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the ''Energiewende'' have been passed on to consumers, who have had rising electricity bills.

== Voluntary market mechanisms for renewable electricity ==
Voluntary markets, also referred to as green power markets, are driven by consumer preference. Voluntary markets allow a consumer to choose to do more than policy decisions require and reduce the environmental impact of their electricity use. Voluntary green power products must offer a significant benefit and value to buyers to be successful. Benefits may include zero or reduced greenhouse gas emissions, other pollution reductions or other environmental improvements on power stations.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/gpmarket/markets.htm |title= Voluntary and mandatory markets |date= 25 March 2013|work= |publisher= United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The driving factors behind voluntary green electricity within the EU are the liberalized electricity markets and the RES Directive. According to the directive, the EU Member States must ensure that the origin of electricity produced from renewables can be guaranteed and therefore a "guarantee of origin" must be issued (article 15). Environmental organisations are using the voluntary market to create new renewables and improving sustainability of the existing power production. In the US the main tool to track and stimulate voluntary actions is Green-e program managed by [[Center for Resource Solutions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.green-e.org/about.shtml |title= About Green-e |year= 2013|work= |publisher= Center for Resource Solutions |accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe the main voluntary tool used by the NGOs to promote sustainable electricity production is [[EKOenergy]] label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ekoenergy.org/where-can-i-buy-it/questions-and-answers |archive-url= https://archive.is/20130704002836/http://www.ekoenergy.org/where-can-i-buy-it/questions-and-answers |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2013-07-04 |title= Frequently asked questions |date= March 2013 |work=  |publisher= EKOenergy Network |accessdate= 18 April 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of events in 2006 pushed renewable energy up the political agenda, including the US mid-term elections in November, which confirmed [[clean energy]] as a mainstream issue. Also in 2006, the Stern Review&lt;ref name=Stern /&gt; made a strong economic case for investing in low carbon technologies now, and argued that economic growth need not be incompatible with cutting energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Environment Programme and New Energy Finance Ltd.

New government spending, regulation, and policies helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better than many other sectors.&lt;ref name=obama/&gt; Most notably, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]'s [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] included more than $70&amp;nbsp;billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs. This policy-stimulus combination represents the largest federal commitment in U.S. history for renewables, advanced transportation, and energy conservation initiatives. Based on these new rules, many more utilities strengthened their clean-energy programs.&lt;ref name=obama/&gt; [[Clean Edge]] suggests that the commercialization of clean energy will help countries around the world deal with the current economic malaise.&lt;ref name=obama/&gt; Once-promising solar energy company, [[Solyndra]], became involved in a political controversy involving U.S. President Barack Obama's [[Presidency of Barack Obama|administration]]'s authorization of a $535&amp;nbsp;million loan guarantee to the Corporation in 2009 as part of a program to promote alternative energy growth.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/08/solar-energy-company-touted-by-obama-goes-bankrupt/ Solar Energy Company Touted By Obama Goes Bankrupt], ABC News, 31 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason.com/archives/2011/09/09/obamas-crony-capitalism Obama's Crony Capitalism], Reason, 9 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The company ceased all business activity, filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy, and laid-off nearly all of its employees in early September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Solyndra-Shutting-Down-128802718.html |title=Solyndra to Declare Bankruptcy |publisher=NBC News |date=2 September 2011 |first=Scott |last=McGrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9PJ89JG0.htm Solyndra files for bankruptcy, looks for buyer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225041731/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9PJ89JG0.htm |date=25 December 2011 }}.

In his 24 January 2012, [[State of the Union]] address, President Barack Obama restated his commitment to renewable energy. Obama said that he "will not walk away from the promise of clean energy." Obama called for a commitment by the Defense Department to purchase 1,000 MW of renewable energy. He also mentioned the long-standing Interior Department commitment to permit 10,000 MW of renewable energy projects on public land in 2012.&lt;ref name="Lindsay Morris"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/blog/post/2012/01/obama-sticking-to-promise-of-clean-energy |title=Obama: Sticking to "Promise of Clean Energy" |author=Lindsay Morris |date=25 January 2012 |work=Renewable Energy World }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, renewable energy plays a major role in the energy mix of many countries globally. Renewables are becoming increasingly economic in both developing and developed countries. Prices for renewable energy technologies, primarily wind power and solar power, continued to drop, making renewables competitive with conventional energy sources. Without a level playing field, however, high market penetration of renewables is still dependent on robust promotional policies. Fossil fuel subsidies, which are far higher than those for renewable energy, remain in place and quickly need to be phased out.&lt;ref&gt;REN21. (2013). ''Renewables 2013 Global Status Report'', (Paris: REN21 Secretariat), {{ISBN|978-3-9815934-0-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

United Nations' Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] has said that "renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/08/u-n-secretary-general-renewables-can-end-energy-poverty |title=U.N.

The group is to be co-chaired by Kandeh Yumkella, the chair of UN Energy and director general of the UN Industrial Development Organisation, and Charles Holliday, chairman of Bank of America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/nov/02/human-development-report-renewable-energy |title=UN calls for universal access to renewable energy |author=Mark Tran |date=2 November 2011 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide use of solar power and wind power continued to grow significantly in 2012. Solar electricity consumption increased by 58 percent, to 93 terawatt-hours (TWh).

==100% renewable energy==
{{Main article|100% renewable energy}}

The incentive to use 100% renewable energy for electricity, transport, or even total primary energy supply globally, has been motivated by [[global warming]] and other ecological as well as economic concerns. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of the total global energy demand. In reviewing 164 recent scenarios of future renewable energy growth, the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17% of total energy by 2030, and 27% by 2050; the highest forecast projected 43% supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77% by 2050.&lt;ref name="IPCC 2011 17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |title=Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation |author=IPCC |year=2011 |work=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA |page=17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111081913/http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |archivedate=11 January 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated.&lt;ref name=pg11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/04/100-percent-renewable-vision-building?amp;buffer_share=fdc06 |title=100 Percent Renewable Vision Building |author=Paul Gipe |date=4 April 2013 |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply.

[[Mark Z. Jacobson]], professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University and director of its Atmosphere and Energy Program says producing all new energy with [[wind power]], [[solar power]], and [[hydropower]] by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be "primarily social and political, not technological or economic". Jacobson says that energy costs with a wind, solar, water system should be similar to today's energy costs.&lt;ref name=enpol2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/DJEnPolicyPt2.pdf |title=Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power, Part II: Reliability, system and transmission costs, and policies |author1=Mark A.

Similarly, in the United States, the independent National Research Council has noted that "sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change, energy security, and the escalation of energy costs … Renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the United States, taken collectively, can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand."&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12619|title=Electricity from Renewable Resources: Status, Prospects, and Impediments  |author=National Research Council| year=2010|pages=4|publisher=National Academies of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political and not technological. According to the 2013 ''Post Carbon Pathways'' report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: [[climate change denial]], the [[fossil fuels lobby]], political inaction, unsustainable energy consumption, outdated energy infrastructure, and financial constraints.&lt;ref name="John Wiseman et al"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postcarbonpathways.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Post-Carbon-Pathways-Report-2013_Final-V.pdf |title=Post Carbon Pathways |author=John Wiseman |date=April 2013 |work=University of Melbourne |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620031627/http://www.postcarbonpathways.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Post-Carbon-Pathways-Report-2013_Final-V.pdf |archivedate=20 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency==
{{Main article|Efficient energy use}}

Moving towards energy sustainability will require changes not only in the way energy is supplied, but in the way it is used, and reducing the amount of energy required to deliver various goods or services is essential. Opportunities for improvement on the demand side of the energy equation are as rich and diverse as those on the supply side, and often offer significant economic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;

InterAcademy Council (2007). [http://www.interacademycouncil.net/Object.File/Master/12/053/Executive%20Summary.pdf ''Lighting the way: Toward a sustainable energy future''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128074454/http://www.interacademycouncil.net/Object.File/Master/12/053/Executive%20Summary.pdf |date=28 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sustainable energy economy requires commitments to both renewables and efficiency. Renewable energy and [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] are said to be the "twin pillars" of [[sustainable energy]] policy. [[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy|The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]] has explained that both resources must be developed in order to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions:&lt;ref name=am&gt;

American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (2007).
[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090429195906/http://www.aceee.org/store/proddetail.cfm?CFID=785209&amp;CFTOKEN=22090724&amp;ItemID=432&amp;CategoryID=7 ''The Twin Pillars of Sustainable Energy: Synergies between Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Technology and Policy''] Report E074.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Efficiency is essential to slowing the energy demand growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use. If energy use grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. Likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed.&lt;ref name=am /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The IEA has stated that renewable energy and energy efficiency policies are complementary tools for the development of a sustainable energy future, and should be developed together instead of being developed in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17206">{{short description|Using wastes as an input material to create valuable products as new outputs}}
'''Resource recovery''' is using [[waste]]s as an input material to create valuable products as new outputs. The aim is to reduce the amount of waste generated, therefore reducing the need for [[landfill]] space and also extracting maximum value from waste. Resource recovery delays the need to use [[raw material]]s in the manufacturing process. Materials found in [[municipal solid waste]] can be used to make new products. [[Plastic]], [[paper]], [[aluminium]], [[glass]] and [[metal]] are examples of where value can be found in waste.

Resource recovery goes further than just the [[Waste management|management of waste]]. [[life cycle analysis|Life-cycle analysis]] (LCA) can be used to compare the resource recovery potential of different treatment technologies. Improvements to administration, [[Source separation (recycling)|source separation]] and collection, [[reuse]] and [[recycling]] are important. For example, organic materials can be treated with [[anaerobic digestion]] and turned into energy, [[compost]] or [[fertilizer]].

Resource recovery can also be an aim in the context of [[sanitation]]. Here, the term refers to approaches to recover the resources that are contained in [[wastewater]] and [[human excreta]] (urine and feces). The term "toilet resources" has come into use recently.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.toiletboard.org/sanitation-economy|title="The Sanitation Economy"|last=|first=|date=26 March 2018|website=Toilet Board Coalition|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those resources include: nutrients ([[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]), organic matter, energy and water. This concept is also referred to as [[ecological sanitation]]. Separation of waste flows can help make resource recovery simpler. Examples include keeping urine separate from feces (as in [[urine diversion]] toilets) and keeping [[greywater]] and [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] separate in municipal wastewater systems.

== Materials used as a source ==

===Solid waste===
{{main|Recycling}}
[[Image:Steel recycling bales.jpg|thumb|right|Steel crushed and baled for [[recycling]]]]
Recycling is a resource recovery practice that refers to the collection and reuse of disposed materials such as empty beverage containers. The materials from which the items are made can be reprocessed into new products. Material for recycling may be collected separately from general waste using dedicated bins and collection vehicles, or sorted directly from mixed waste streams.

The most common consumer products recycled include [[aluminium]] such as beverage cans, [[copper]] such as wire, [[steel]] food and aerosol cans, old steel furnishings or equipment, [[HDPE|polyethylene]] and [[Recycling of PET Bottles|PET]] bottles, [[glass]] bottles and jars, [[paperboard]] [[cartons]], [[newspapers]], magazines and light paper, and [[corrugated fiberboard]] boxes.

[[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[LDPE]], [[Polypropylene|PP]], and [[Polystyrene|PS]] (see [[resin identification code]]) are also recyclable. These items are usually composed of a single type of material, making them relatively easy to recycle into new products. The recycling of complex products (such as computers and electronic equipment) is more difficult, due to the additional dismantling and separation required.

The type of recycling material accepted varies by city and country. Each city and country have different recycling programs in place that can handle the various types of recyclable materials.

===Wastewater and excreta===
{{main|Reuse of excreta|Wastewater reuse|Ecological sanitation}}
Valuable resources can be recovered from [[wastewater]], [[sewage sludge]], [[Fecal sludge management|fecal sludge]] and [[Human waste|human excreta]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/publications/other-publication-types/books-monographs/iwmi-jointly-published/resource-recovery-from-waste/|title=Resource recovery from waste: business models for energy, nutrient and water reuse in low- and middle-income countries|last=Otoo|first=Miriam|last2=Drechsel|first2=Pay|publisher=Routledge - Earthscan|year=2018|isbn=|location=Oxon, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include water, energy, and fertilizing nutrients [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]], as well as micro-nutrients such as [[sulphur]] and [[organic matter]]. There is also increasing interest for recovering other raw materials from wastewater, such as [[bioplastic]]s and metals such as silver.&lt;ref&gt;Dutch Association of Regional Water Authorities. 2013. [https://www.uvw.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/362awk-VisionBrochure-AWK_def.pdf Vision brochure: Wastewater management roadmap towards 2030].&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, wastewater systems were designed only to remove excreta and wastewater from urban areas. Water was used to flush away the waste, often discharging into nearby waterbodies. Since the 1970s, there has been increasing interest in treating the wastewater to protect the environment, and efforts focused primarily on cleaning the water at the end of the pipe.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Since around the year 2003, the concepts of [[ecological sanitation]] and [[sustainable sanitation]] have emerged with the focus on recovering resources from wastewater.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} As of 2016, the term "toilet resources" came into use, and encouraged more attention to the potential for resource recovery from toilets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The following resources can be recovered: 
*Water: In many water-scarce areas there are increasing pressures to recover water from wastewater.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2006, the [[World Health Organization]], in collaboration with the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) and the [[United Nations Environment Programme|United Nations Environment Program]] (UNEP), developed guidelines for safe use of wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;WHO (2006). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1004 WHO Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater - Volume IV: Excreta and greywater use in agriculture]. World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many national governments have their own regulations regarding the use of recovered water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Singapore for example aims to recover enough water from its wastewater systems to meet the water needs of half the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/singapores-toilet-to-tap-concept/a-16904636|title=Singapore's 'toilet to tap' concept|last=|first=|date=2013-06-25|work=Deutsche Welle|access-date=2017-11-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They call this [[NEWater]]. Another related concept for wastewater reuse is [[sewer mining]].
*Energy: The production of [[biogas]] from [[Sewage sludge|wastewater sludge]] is now common practice at [[Wastewater treatment|wastewater treatment plants]]. In addition, a number for methods have been researched regarding use of wastewater sludge and excreta as fuel sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eawag.ch/fileadmin/Domain1/Abteilungen/sandec/publikationen/EWM/Treatment_Objectives/Production_Pellets_and_Electricity_from_FS.pdf|title=Production of Pellets and Electricity from Faecal Sludge|last=|first=|date=2015|work=SANDEC NEWS|access-date=2017-11-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Fertilizing nutrients: Human excreta contains nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other micronutrients that are needed for agricultural production. These can be recovered through [[Precipitation (chemistry)|chemical precipitation]] or stripping processes, or simply by use of the wastewater or [[sewage sludge]]. However, reuse of sewage sludge poses risks due to high concentrations of undesirable compounds, such as [[heavy metals]], [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s and other chemicals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since the majority of fertilizing nutrients are found in excreta, it can be useful to separate the excreta fractions of wastewater (e.g. toilet waste) from the rest of the wastewater flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=juicry4LaRgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Source Separation and Decentralization for Wastewater Management|last=Larsen|first=Tove A.|last2=Udert|first2=Kai M.|last3=Lienert|first3=Judit|date=2013-02-01|publisher=IWA Publishing|isbn=9781843393481|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reduces the risk for undesirable compounds and reduces the volume that needs to be treated before applying recovered nutrients in agricultural production.

Other methods are also being developed for transforming wastewater into valuable products. Growing [[Hermetia illucens|Black Soldier Flies]] in excreta or organic waste can produce fly larvae as a protein feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lalander|first=Cecilia|last2=Diener|first2=Stefan|last3=Magri|first3=Maria Elisa|last4=Zurbrügg|first4=Christian|last5=Lindström|first5=Anders|last6=Vinnerås|first6=Björn|title=Faecal sludge management with the larvae of the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) — From a hygiene aspect|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0048969713004555|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=458-460|pages=312–318|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.04.033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers are harvesting [[fatty acid]]s from wastewater to make bioplastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wateronline.com/doc/revolutionary-tech-makes-plastic-from-wastewater-0001|title='Revolutionary' Tech Makes Plastic From Wastewater|last=|first=|date=2015-04-07|work=Water Online|access-date=2017-11-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organic matter===
{{main|Composting|Home composting|Anaerobic digestion|Microbial fuel cell}}
[[Image:Compost Heap.jpg|thumb|right|An active [[compost]] heap.]]
Disposed materials that are organic in nature, such as plant material, food scraps, and paper products, can be recycled using biological composting and digestion processes to [[decompose]] the organic matter. The resulting organic material is then recycled as [[mulch]] or [[compost]] for agricultural or landscaping purposes. In addition, waste gas from the process (such as [[methane]]) can be captured and used for generating electricity and heat (CHP/[[cogeneration]]) maximising efficiencies. The intention of biological processing is to control and accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter.

There is a large variety of composting and digestion methods and technologies varying in complexity from simple home compost heaps, to small town scale batch digesters, industrial-scale enclosed-vessel digestion of mixed domestic waste (see [[mechanical biological treatment]]). Methods of biological decomposition are differentiated as being [[Aerobic decomposition|aerobic]] or [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] methods, though hybrids of the two methods also exist.

Anaerobic digestion of the organic fraction of [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW) has been found to be more environmentally effective, than landfill, incineration or [[pyrolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idosi.org/gjer/gjer3(3)09/4.pdf Life Cycle Environmental Assessment of Municipal Solid Waste to Energy Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurojournals.com/ejsr_34_3_11.pdf Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of Municipal Solid Waste Management in the State of Kuwait]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Life-cycle assessment|Life cycle analysis]] (LCA) was used to compare different technologies. The resulting biogas (methane) though must be used for cogeneration (electricity and heat preferably on or close to the site of production) and can be used with a little upgrading in gas combustion engines or turbines. With further upgrading to synthetic natural gas it can be injected into the natural gas network or further refined to [[hydrogen]] for use in stationary cogeneration fuel cells. Its use in fuel cells eliminates the pollution from products of combustion. There is a large variety of composting and digestion methods and technologies varying in complexity from simple home compost heaps, to small town scale batch digesters, industrial-scale, enclosed-vessel digestion of mixed domestic waste (see [[mechanical biological treatment]]). Methods of biological decomposition are differentiated as being [[Aerobic decomposition|aerobic]] or [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] methods, though hybrids of the two methods also exist.

==Recovery methods==
In many countries, source-separated [[curbside collection]] is one method of resource recovery.

=== Australia ===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
In Australia, every urban domestic household is provided with three bins: one for [[recycling]]; another for general waste; and another for garden materials, this bin is provided by the municipality if requested. To encourage recycling, municipalities provide large recycle bins, which are larger than general waste bins. Many American localities have [[dual-stream recycling]], with paper collected in bags or boxes and all other materials in a recycling bin. In either case, the recovered materials are trucked to a [[materials recovery facility]] for further processing.

Municipal, commercial and industrial, construction and demolition debris is dumped at landfills and some is recycled. Household disposal materials are segregated: recyclables sorted and made into new products, and unusable material is dumped in landfill areas. According to the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] (ABS), the recycling rate is high and is "increasing, with 99% of households reporting that they had recycled or reused within the past year (2003 survey), up from 85% in 1992". In 2002–03 "30% of materials from municipalities, 45% from commercial and industrial generators and 57% from construction and demolition debris" was recycled. Energy is produced is part of resource recovery as well: some [[landfill gas]] is captured for fuel or electricity generation, although this is considered the last resort, as the point of resource recovery is avoidance of landfill disposal altogether.

==Sustainability==
Resource recovery is a key component in a business' ability to maintaining [[ISO14001]] accreditation. Companies are encouraged to improve their environmental efficiencies each year. One way to do this is by changing a company from a system of managing wastes to a resource recovery system (such as recycling: glass, food waste, paper and cardboard, plastic bottles etc.)

[[Education]] and [[awareness]] in the area of  resource recovery is increasingly important from a global perspective of [[resource management]]. The [[Talloires Declaration]] is a declaration for [[sustainability]] concerned about the unprecedented scale and speed of environmental [[pollution]] and [[Chemical decomposition|degradation]], and the [[Resource depletion|depletion]] of [[natural resources]]. Local, regional, and global [[air]] pollution; accumulation and distribution of toxic wastes; destruction and depletion of forests, [[soil]], and [[water]]; depletion of the [[ozone layer]] and emission of "green house" gases threaten the survival of humans and thousands of other living species, the integrity of the earth and its [[biodiversity]], the security of nations, and the heritage of future generations. Several universities have implemented the Talloires Declaration by establishing [[environmental management]] and resource recovery programs. [[University]] and [[vocational]] education are promoted by various organizations, e.g., [[WAMITAB]] and [[Chartered Institution of Wastes Management]]. Many supermarkets encourage customers to use their [[reverse vending machines]] to deposit used purchased containers and receive a refund from the recycling fees. Brands that manufacture such machines include [[Tomra]] and [[Envipco]].

In 2010, CNBC aired the documentary ''[[Trash Inc: The Secret Life of Garbage]]'' about waste, what happens to it when it's "thrown away", and its impact on the world.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-secret-garbage-20100929,0,2134032.story Television review: 'Trash Inc.'], [[Susan Carpenter]], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 29 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extended producer responsibility===
[[Extended producer responsibility]] (EPR) is a  pricing strategy that promotes integrating all costs associated with a given product throughout its life cycle. Having the market price also reflect the "end-of-life disposal costs" encourages more accuracy in pricing. Extended producer responsibility is meant to impose accountability over the entire lifecycle of products, from production, to packaging, to transport and disposal or reuse. EPR requires firms that manufacture, import and/or sell products to be responsible for those products throughout the life and disposal or reuse of products.

A '''road diet''', also called a '''lane reduction''' or '''road rechannelization''', is a technique in [[transportation planning]] whereby the number of travel lanes and/or effective width of the road is reduced in order to achieve systemic improvements.

==Techniques==
A typical road diet technique is to reduce the number of lanes on a roadway cross-section. One of the most common applications of a road diet is to improve safety or provide space for other modes of travel.  For example, a two-way, four lane road might be reduced to one travel lane in each direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://carfreeamerica.net/road-diet-guide/|title=Road Diet Guide - Car Free America|work=Car Free America|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The freed-up space is then used to provide or enhance some of the following features:

*Adding or widening of footpaths/[[sidewalk]]s
*Adding or widening of boulevards (landscaping strips)
*Adding [[cycle lane]]s on one or both sides of the road
*Adding [[reserved track|reserved tramtracks]], usually in the middle of the road
*Widening remaining traffic lanes (if previously unsafely narrow to allow four lanes)
*Adding a [[Center left-turn lane#Turn lanes|center turn lane]] / flush traffic median for turning traffic
*Adding a [[reversible lane|reversible center lane]]
*Conversion of the rightmost or leftmost travel lane to a breakdown lane (The [[Lodge Freeway]] in [[metro Detroit]] is an example of this after [[Interstate 96|I-96]], the Jeffries Freeway, was built.)

If properly designed, traffic does not divert to other streets after a road diet, because the road previously provided excessive capacity. In other scenarios, reduction of traffic (either local traffic or overall traffic) is intended in the scheme. Road diets are usually successful on roads carrying fewer than 19,000 vehicles per day. Road diets can succeed at volumes up to about 23,000 vehicles per day. However, more extensive reconstruction is needed. Examples include replacing signals with [[roundabout]]s, [[traffic calming]] on parallel streets to discourage traffic from diverting away from the main road, and other means to keep traffic moving smoothly and uniformly.

===Lane diets===
In a lane diet, the width of a lane is decreased to reduce vehicle speeds and yield space for other use.  Typically [[vehicular]] travel lane widths are narrowed to no more than ten feet, and left turn (in countries where drivers use the right-hand side of the road) storage lanes to nine or ten feet. Resulting space can be applied to pedestrian refuges, medians, sidewalks, shoulders, parking, or bike lanes. Lane width guidelines in the United States are offered as a range and lane diets fall within this range.

In many cases of four-lane roadways with double-yellow, this can present a hazard for oncoming traffic in the "passing lane", as well as left-turners.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Sometimes four-lane with double-yellow is upgraded to five-lane with center turn lane since that practice is more of an upgrade than a "diet" like three-lane with center turn lane is.

==Benefits==
Proponents of road diets generally believe key benefits include lower vehicular speeds, reduced crash rates, and improved [[pedestrian|pedestrian safety]]. Other benefits of road diets include promoting better land use, reducing [[induced traffic]], promoting greater driving attentiveness, and promoting [[cycling]] through the addition of bicycle lanes. Providing dedicated left turn (in countries that drive on the right-hand side of the road) lanes at intersections can improve vehicular safety and can enable efficiency gains along the roadway.

Researchers have found that road diets can be expected to reduce overall crash frequency by 19% to 43%, with the higher crash reductions occurring in small urban areas than in metropolitan areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Evaluation of Lane Reduction 'Road Diet' Measures on Crashes |author= Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center |date= June 2010 |url= http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/10053/index.cfm |publisher= [[Federal Highway Administration]] |id= FHWA-HRT-10-053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A leading proponent of road diets is former Florida Bicycle and Pedestrian Coordinator Dan Burden, who now helms the Walkable and Livable Communities Institute. Burden and Peter Lagerwey published an article on the topic in 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Burden |first1= Dan |first2= Peter |last2= Lagerwey |lastauthoramp= yes |title= Road Diets: Fixing the Big Roads |publisher= Walkable Communities |date= March 1999 |url= http://www.walkable.org/download/rdiets.pdf |format= PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting that in two cases, 95% of residents were initially opposed to roadway constriction. Additional studies have shown that road diets often achieve these positive effects without reducing traffic volumes.

Among studies now showing that there are safety improvements to driving when lane widths are reduced include a recent report by the [[NCHRP|National Cooperative Highway Research Program]] (NCHRP) and work analyzing traffic safety for 14 years in all 50 states by Robert B. Noland.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Criticisms==
Critics of road diets generally believe they can negatively affect the speed and reliability of transit service operating on the roadway, particularly if [[bus stop]]s are located in pullouts and traffic queues delay buses attempting to re-enter traffic. Constructing [[bus bulb]]s can mitigate these effects though this feature results in delays for other vehicles.

Not all multi-lane arterials are good candidates for road constriction. Added congestion can outweigh benefits if vehicle traffic volumes exceed the capacity of the three-lane roadway. This threshold is approximately 20,000 vehicles per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Evaluation of Lane Reduction 'Road Diet' Measures and Their Effects on Crashes and Injuries |author= Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center |date= March 2004 |url= http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/humanfac/04082/index.cfm |publisher= Federal Highway Administration |id= FHWA-HRT-04-082 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Burden notes additional characteristics of better candidates for vehicle lane removal.

Other concerns regard public safety; police, fire and ambulances may be slowed and if an evacuation is ordered, the evacuation will be slower.

==Paradise==
The 2018 "Camp" fire, in which the town of Paradise CA completely burned, is thought to have been made more catastrophic due to the implementation of a road diet. The city's decision to install a Vision Zero-Type Road Diet along its primary traffic artery may have contributed to loss of life as traffic backed up and gridlocked. Some were reduced to fleeing on foot. Others were unable to outrun the flames and lost their lives.

Fires happen in Butte county. In 2008, ten years prior to the one that totally destroyed the town, a massive fire prompted evacuations of the communities of Paradise and Magalia. The evacuation was plagued with gridlock. In shades of the fatal future fire, many residents were trapped in their cars with flames racing along both sides of the road. With cars hopelessly blocked, these people fled on foot, barely escaping with their lives.

Three of those routes are narrow, two lane mountain roads. The grand jury noted that these roads have “significant constraints limiting their use as evacuation routes during a major event, especially another event of multiple fires.”

The only area road capable of handing more than a small capacity was Skyway Boulevard, a state highway connecting the mountain towns with the city of Chico. The grand jury recommended, “immediate modification of Skyway, from Paradise to Chico, as an emergency evacuation route, by removing trees and brush and creating fire barriers on both sides of the road.”

Instead, in 2012 the county decided to narrow Skyway in Paradise, in a Vision Zero-Type Road Diet, removing lanes and instead installing bike lanes, bulb-outs and other traffic calming measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=  The Deadly Consequences of Road Diets|author= Christopher D.

Others argue self-denial involves avoidance and holding back of [[happiness]] and pleasurable experiences from oneself that is only damaging to other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethics of Interpersonal Relationships|author=Robert W.

==Religion and self-denial==
Self-denial can constitute an important element of religious practice in various belief systems. An exemplification is the self-denial advocated by several Christian confessions where it is believed to be a means of reaching happiness and a deeper religious understanding, sometimes described as 'becoming a true follower of Christ'. The foundation of self-denial in the Christian context is based the recognition of a higher God-given will, which the Christian practicer choose to adhere to, and prioritize over his or her own will or desires. This can in daily life be expressed by renunciation of certain physically pleasureable, yet from a religious stand-point inappropriate activities, sometimes referred to as 'desires of the flesh', which e.g. could entail certain sexual practices and over-indulgant eating or drinking. In the Christian faith Jesus is often mentioned as a positive example of self-denial, both in relation to the deeds performed during his life, as well as the sacrifice attributed to his death.

==Based on gender==
Self-denial in women is linked to cultural definitions of [[femininity]] which women have [[internalization|internalized]] to such an extent that self-abnegation had become basic to women's experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Self Love and Christian Ethics|author=Darlene Fozard Weaver|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2002|isbn=978-0-521-52097-3|page=79|url=http://mccclib.mccc.edu:2094/lib/mccc/reader.action?docID=10070261#}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judith Plaskow]] observed this and argued that it was more linked to women than men because they were to follow this Christian virtue because of their detriment. Women are seen in a domestic perspective and self-denial puts all things women were once exposed to the side so they can be committed to their marriage and family. The way women are portrayed has not changed much throughout the years because the [[patriarchal]] perspective continues to be present. Through self-denial women have to sacrifice their interests and goals to satisfy not only family, but many times social norms. They are not allowed to be independent but more so are trapped to be the individual they are expected to be. However, in men, this is different.

[[Masculinity]] is linked to self-denial when put in a male perspective. Men's self-denial is both a source of men's existential alienation and part of the infrastructure of men's power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Recreating Sexual Politics(Routledge Revivals):Men, Feminism, and Politics|author=Victor Seidler|location=New York|publisher=Routledge|date=1991|isbn=978-0-415-57289-7|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uB-MAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=why+women+self-denial&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp-J_3qrnJAhUDOD4KHcRuCTcQ6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=why%20women%20self-denial&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; When men go through self-denial it is interpreted as self-improvement as put by the book ''[[Manliness (book)|Manliness]]'' in which they emphasize self-denial as a comparison to the image of the goal of Superman in "What does not kill me makes me stronger".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manliness|author=Harvey C.

'''Sign languages''' (also known as '''signed languages''') are [[language]]s that use the visual-manual modality to convey meaning. Language is expressed via the manual signstream in combination with [[Sign language#Non-manual elements|non-manual elements]]. Sign languages are full-fledged natural languages with their own grammar and lexicon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This means that sign languages are not universal and they are not [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Sign Language?|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/what-sign-language|accessdate=10 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213195125/https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/what-sign-language|archivedate=13 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are also striking similarities among sign languages.

Linguists consider both spoken and signed communication to be types of [[natural language]], meaning that both emerged through an abstract, protracted aging process and evolved over time without meticulous planning. Sign language should not be confused with "[[body language]]", a type of [[non verbal communication|nonverbal communication]].

Wherever communities of [[deaf]] people exist, sign languages have developed, and are at the cores of local [[deaf culture]]s. Although signing is used primarily by the deaf and [[Hearing loss|hard of hearing]], it is also used by hearing individuals, such as those unable to physically speak, those who have trouble with spoken language due to a disability or condition ([[augmentative and alternative communication]]), or those with deaf family members, such as children of deaf adults ([[Child of deaf adult|CODAs]]).

It is unclear how many sign languages currently exist worldwide. Each country generally has its own, native sign language, and some have more than one. The 2013 edition of [[Ethnologue]] lists 137 sign languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Linguists distinguish natural sign languages from other systems that are precursors to them or derived from them, such as invented manual codes for spoken languages, [[home sign]], "baby sign", and signs learned by non-human primates.

{{Main|History of sign language}}
[[Image:Arte para enseñar a hablar a los mudos.jpg|thumb|Juan Pablo Bonet, {{lang|es|Reducción de las letras y arte para enseñar a hablar a los mudos}} ("Reduction of letters and art for teaching mute people to speak") (Madrid, 1620)]]

Groups of deaf people have used sign languages throughout history. One of the earliest written records of a sign language is from the fifth century BC, in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', where [[Socrates]] says: "If we hadn't a voice or a tongue, and wanted to express things to one another, wouldn't we try to make signs by moving our hands, head, and the rest of our body, just as dumb people do at present?"&lt;ref name="bauman2008"&gt;{{cite book | first=Dirksen | last=Bauman |  year=2008 | title=Open your eyes: Deaf studies talking | publisher=University of Minnesota Press | isbn=0-8166-4619-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 19th century, most of what is known about historical sign languages is limited to the manual alphabets (fingerspelling systems) that were invented to facilitate transfer of words from a spoken language to a sign language, rather than documentation of the language itself. [[Pedro Ponce de León]] (1520–1584) is said to have developed the first manual alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nielsen |first1= K.E..|title=A Disability History of the United States |date=2012 |publisher= Beacon Press |isbn=9780807022047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jbulwer.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Chirogram from ''Chirologia'', 1644]]
In Britain, manual alphabets were also in use for a number of purposes, such as secret communication,&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins, John (1641). ''Mercury, the Swift and Silent Messenger''. The book is a work on cryptography, and fingerspelling was referred to as one method of "secret discoursing, by signes and gestures".  Wilkins gave an example of such a system: "Let the tops of the fingers signifie the five vowels; the middle parts, the first five consonants; the bottomes of them, the five next consonants; the spaces betwixt the fingers the foure next.  One finger laid on the side of the hand may signifie T.  Two fingers V the consonant; Three W.  The little finger crossed X.  The wrist Y.  The middle of the hand Z." (1641:116-117)&lt;/ref&gt; public speaking, or communication by deaf people.&lt;ref&gt;John Bulwer's "Chirologia: or the natural language of the hand.", published in 1644, London, mentions that alphabets are in use by deaf people, although Bulwer presents a different system which is focused on public speaking.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1648, [[John Bulwer]] described "Master Babington", a deaf man proficient in the use of a manual alphabet, "contryved on the joynts of his fingers", whose wife could converse with him easily, even in the dark through the use of [[tactile signing]].&lt;ref&gt;Bulwer, J. (1648) ''Philocopus, or the Deaf and Dumbe Mans Friend'', London: Humphrey and Moseley.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1680, [[George Dalgarno]] published ''Didascalocophus, or, The deaf and dumb mans tutor'',&lt;ref&gt;Dalgarno, George. ''Didascalocophus, or, The deaf and dumb mans tutor''. Oxford: Halton, 1680.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he presented his own method of deaf education, including an "arthrological" alphabet, where letters are indicated by pointing to different joints of the fingers and palm of the left hand. Arthrological systems had been in use by hearing people for some time;&lt;ref&gt;See Wilkins (1641) above. Wilkins was aware that the systems he describes are old, and refers to Bede's account of Roman and Greek finger alphabets.&lt;/ref&gt; some have speculated that they can be traced to early [[Ogham]] manual alphabets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/DeafStudiesTeaching/bslsoc/Sessions/s9.htm |title=Session 9 |publisher=Bris.ac.uk |date=2000-11-07 |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602102335/http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/DeafStudiesTeaching/bslsoc/Sessions/s9.htm |archivedate=2010-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, G. "The Ancient Origins of Sign Handshapes" ''Sign Language Studies'' '''2'''(3) (2002): 322-334.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[vowel]]s of this alphabet have survived in the contemporary alphabets used in [[British Sign Language]], [[Auslan]] and [[New Zealand Sign Language]]. The earliest known printed pictures of consonants of the modern [[two-handed alphabet]] appeared in 1698 with ''Digiti Lingua'' (Latin for ''Language'' [or ''Tongue''] ''of the Finger''), a pamphlet by an anonymous author who was himself unable to speak.&lt;ref&gt;Moser H.M., O'Neill J.J., Oyer H.J., Wolfe S.M., Abernathy E.A., and Schowe, B.M. "Historical Aspects of Manual Communication" ''Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders'' '''25''' (1960) 145-151.&lt;br /&gt;
and Hay, A. and Lee, R. ''A Pictorial History of the evolution of the British Manual Alphabet'' (British Deaf History Society Publications: Middlesex, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  He suggested that the manual alphabet could also be used by mutes, for silence and secrecy, or purely for entertainment. Nine of its letters can be traced to earlier alphabets, and 17 letters of the modern two-handed alphabet can be found among the two sets of 26 handshapes depicted.

[[Charles de La Fin]] published a book in 1692 describing an alphabetic system where pointing to a body part represented the first letter of the part (e.g. Brow=B), and vowels were located on the fingertips as with the other British systems.&lt;ref&gt;Charles de La Fin (1692). ''Sermo mirabilis, or, The silent language whereby one may learn ... how to impart his mind to his friend, in any language ... being a wonderful art kept secret for several ages in Padua, and now published only to the wise and prudent ...'' London, Printed for Tho. Salusbury... and sold by Randal Taylor... 1692. {{OCLC|27245872}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described such codes for both English and Latin.

By 1720, the British manual alphabet had found more or less its present form.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Defoe (1720). "The Life and Adventures of Mr. Duncan Campbell"&lt;/ref&gt; Descendants of this alphabet have been used by deaf communities (or at least in classrooms) in former British colonies India, Australia, New Zealand, Uganda and South Africa, as well as the republics and provinces of the former Yugoslavia, Grand Cayman Island in the Caribbean, Indonesia, Norway, Germany and the United States.

Frenchman [[Abbé de l'Épée|Charles-Michel de l'Épée]] published his manual alphabet in the 18th century, which has survived basically unchanged in France and North America until the present time. In 1755, Abbé de l'Épée founded the first school for deaf children in Paris; [[Laurent Clerc]] was arguably its most famous graduate. Clerc went to the United States with [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]] to found the [[American School for the Deaf]] in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;Canlas (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Gallaudet's son, [[Edward Miner Gallaudet]], founded a school for the deaf in 1857 in Washington, D.C., which in 1864 became the National Deaf-Mute College. Now called [[Gallaudet University]], it is still the only liberal arts university for deaf people in the world.

{{Anchor| not speech based}} Sign languages generally do not have any linguistic relation to the spoken languages of the lands in which they arise. The correlation between sign and spoken languages is complex and varies depending on the country more than the spoken language. For example, the US, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand all have English as their dominant language, but [[American Sign Language]] (ASL), used in the US and English-speaking Canada, is derived from [[French Sign Language]] whereas the other three countries sign dialects of [[BANZSL|British, Australian and New Zealand Sign Language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bfi |title=Ethnologue report for language code: bfi |publisher=Ethnologue.com |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009095734/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bfi |archivedate=2012-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the sign languages of Spain and Mexico are very different, despite Spanish being the national language in each country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.org/silesr/2007/silesr2007-008.pdf |title=SIL Electronic Survey Reports: Spanish Sign Language survey |publisher=Sil.org |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020141343/http://www.sil.org/silesr/2007/silesr2007-008.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sign language used in Bolivia is based on ASL rather than any sign language that is used in a Spanish-speaking country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.org/silesr/2009/silesr2009-002.pdf |title=SIL Electronic Survey Reports: Bolivia deaf community and sign language pre-survey report |publisher=Sil.org |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915024309/http://www.sil.org/silesr/2009/silesr2009-002.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Variations also arise within a 'national' sign language which don't necessarily correspond to dialect differences in the national spoken language; rather, they can usually be correlated to the geographic location of residential schools for the deaf.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucas, Ceil]], Robert Bayley and [[Clayton Valli]]. 2001.

[[International Sign]], formerly known as Gestuno, is used mainly at international deaf events such as the [[Deaflympics]] and meetings of the [[World Federation of the Deaf]]. While recent studies claim that International Sign is a kind of a [[pidgin]], they conclude that it is more complex than a typical pidgin and indeed is more like a full sign language.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Supalla, Ted &amp; Rebecca Webb (1995). "The grammar of international sign: A new look at pidgin languages." In: Emmorey, Karen &amp; Judy Reilly (eds). ''Language, gesture, and space.''

== Linguistics ==
In linguistic terms, sign languages are as rich and complex as any spoken language, despite the common misconception that they are not "real languages". Professional [[linguistics|linguists]] have studied many sign languages and found that they exhibit the fundamental properties that exist in all languages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Klima|Klima, Edward S.]]; &amp; [[Ursula Bellugi|Bellugi, Ursula]]. (1979). ''The signs of language''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-80795-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Sandler, Wendy; &amp; Lillo-Martin, Diane. (2006). Sign Language and Linguistic Universals. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sign languages are not [[mime]]—in other words, signs are conventional, often arbitrary and do not necessarily have a visual relationship to their referent, much as most spoken language is not [[onomatopoeic]]. While [[iconicity]] is more systematic and widespread in sign languages than in spoken ones, the difference is not categorical.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; The visual modality allows the human preference for close connections between form and meaning, present but suppressed in spoken languages, to be more fully expressed.&lt;ref&gt;Taub (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that sign languages are a visual rendition of a spoken language. They have complex [[grammar]]s of their own and can be used to discuss any topic, from the simple and concrete to the lofty and abstract.

Sign languages, like spoken languages, organize elementary, meaningless units called phonemes into meaningful [[semantic]] units. (These were once called [[chereme]]s (from the Greek word for "hand") in the case of sign languages, by analogy to the [[phoneme]]s (from Greek for "voice") of spoken languages, but now also called phonemes, since the function is the same.) This is often called [[duality of patterning]]. As in spoken languages, these meaningless units are represented as (combinations of) features, although often also crude distinctions are made in terms of [[handshape]] (or ''handform''), [[Orientation (sign language)|orientation]], [[Location (sign language)|location]] (or ''place of articulation''), [[Movement (sign language)|movement]], and non-manual [[Expression (sign language)|expression]].

In: Hall, T. A. Pompino-Marschall, B. (ed.): Dictionaries of Linguistics and Communication Science. Volume: Phonetics and Phonology. Berlin, New York: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, both sign and spoken languages share the [[Hockett's design features|characteristics]] that linguists have found in all natural human languages, such as transitoriness, [[semanticity]], [[arbitrariness]], [[Productivity (linguistics)|productivity]], and [[Traditional transmission|cultural transmission]].

Common linguistic features of many sign languages are the occurrence of [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]], a high degree of [[inflection]] by means of changes of movement, and a [[Topic-comment language|topic-comment]] [[syntax]]. More than spoken languages, sign languages can convey meaning by simultaneous means, e.g. by the use of space, two manual articulators, and the signer's face and body.  Though there is still much discussion on the topic of iconicity in sign languages, classifiers are generally considered to be highly iconic, as these complex constructions "function as predicates that may express any or all of the following: motion, position, stative-descriptive, or handling information".&lt;ref&gt;Emmorey, K. (2002). Language, cognition and the brain: Insights from sign language research. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; It needs to be noted that the term classifier is not used by everyone working on these constructions. Across the field of sign language linguistics the same constructions are also referred with other terms.

Today, linguists study sign languages as true languages, part of the field of linguistics. However, the category "sign languages" was not added to the [[Linguistic Bibliography|''Linguistic Bibliography / Bibliographie Linguistique'']] until the 1988 volume,&lt;ref&gt;p. 970-972. ''Linguistic Bibliography for the Year 1988''. Leiden, Netherlands:Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; when it appeared with 39 entries.

=== Relationships with spoken languages ===
[[Image:Holečkova, nápis ve znakové řeči.jpg|thumb| Sign language relief sculpture on a stone wall: "Life is beautiful, be happy and love each other", by Czech sculptor [[Zuzana Čížková]] on Holečkova Street in [[Prague]]-[[Smíchov]], by a school for the deaf]]

Always there is a common misconception that sign languages are somehow dependent on spoken languages: that they are spoken language expressed in signs, or that they were invented by hearing people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perlmutter|first=David M.|title=What is Sign Language?|url=http://www.linguisticsociety.org/files/Sign_Language.pdf|work=LSA|accessdate=4 November 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412004710/http://www.linguisticsociety.org/files/Sign_Language.pdf|archivedate=12 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities in [[Sign language in the brain|language processing in the brain]] between signed and spoken languages further perpetuated this misconception. Hearing teachers in deaf schools, such as [[Charles-Michel de l'Épée]] or [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]], are often incorrectly referred to as "inventors" of sign language.  Instead, sign languages, like all natural languages, are developed by the people who use them, in this case, deaf people, who may have little or no knowledge of any spoken language.

As a sign language develops, it sometimes borrows elements from spoken languages, just as all languages borrow from other languages that they are in contact with. Sign languages vary in how and how much they borrow from spoken languages.  In many sign languages, a [[manual alphabet]] (fingerspelling) may be used in signed communication to borrow a word from a spoken language, by spelling out the letters. This is most commonly used for proper names of people and places; it is also used in some languages for concepts for which no sign is available at that moment, particularly if the people involved are to some extent bilingual in the spoken language. Fingerspelling can sometimes be a source of new signs, such as initialized signs, in which the handshape represents the first letter of a spoken word with the same meaning.

On the whole, though, sign languages are independent of spoken languages and follow their own paths of development. For example, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) are quite different and mutually unintelligible, even though the hearing people of the United Kingdom and the United States share the same spoken language. The grammars of sign languages do not usually resemble those of spoken languages used in the same geographical area; in fact, in terms of syntax, ASL shares more with spoken [[Japanese grammar|Japanese]] than it does with English.&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, countries which use a single spoken language throughout may have two or more sign languages, or an area that contains more than one spoken language might use only one sign language. [[South Africa]], which has 11 official spoken languages and a similar number of other widely used spoken languages, is a good example of this. It has only one sign language with two variants due to its history of having two major educational institutions for the deaf which have served different geographic areas of the country.

=== Spatial grammar and simultaneity ===
[[File:Hello1.ogv|thumb|"Hello" in ASL (American sign language)]]
[[File:Hello2.ogv|thumb|Another variation of "hello" in ASL (American sign language)]]
Sign languages exploit the unique features of the visual medium (sight), but may also exploit tactile features ([[Tactile signing|tactile sign languages]]). Spoken language is by and large linear; only one sound can be made or received at a time. Sign language, on the other hand, is visual and, hence, can use a simultaneous expression, although this is limited articulatorily and linguistically. Visual perception allows processing of simultaneous information.

One way in which many sign languages take advantage of the spatial nature of the language is through the use of classifiers. [[American Sign Language grammar#Numeral incorporation and classifiers|Classifiers]] allow a signer to spatially show a referent's type, size, shape, movement, or extent.

The large focus on the possibility of simultaneity in sign languages in contrast to spoken languages is sometimes exaggerated, though. The use of two manual articulators is subject to motor constraints, resulting in a large extent of symmetry&lt;ref&gt;Battison, Robbin (1978). ''Lexical Borrowing in American Sign Language.'' Silver Spring, MD: Linstok Press.&lt;/ref&gt; or signing with one articulator only. Further, sign languages, just like spoken languages, depend on linear sequencing of signs to form sentences; the greater use of simultaneity is mostly seen in the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (internal structure of individual signs).

=== Non-manual elements ===
Sign languages convey much of their [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] through non-manual elements. Postures or movements of the body, head, eyebrows, eyes, cheeks, and mouth are used in various combinations to show several categories of information, including [[lexical item|lexical]] distinction, [[grammar|grammatical]] structure, [[adjective|adjectival]] or [[adverb]]ial content, and [[discourse]] functions.

At the lexical level, signs can be lexically specified for non-manual elements in addition to the manual articulation. For instance, facial expressions may accompany verbs of emotion, as in the sign for ''[https://media.spreadthesign.com/video/mp4/4/4922.mp4 angry]'' in [[Czech Sign Language]]. Non-manual elements may also be lexically contrastive. For example, in ASL (American Sign Language), facial components distinguish some signs from other signs. An example is the sign translated as ''not yet'', which requires that the tongue touch the lower lip and that the head rotate from side to side, in addition to the manual part of the sign. Without these features the sign would be interpreted as ''late''.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, Scott K. (2003). ''Grammar, Gesture, and Meaning in American Sign Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mouthing]]s, which are (parts of) spoken words accompanying lexical signs, can also be contrastive, as in the manually identical signs for ''doctor'' and ''battery'' in [[Dutch Sign Language|Sign Language of the Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1012688117|title=SignGram blueprint: A guide to sign language grammar writing|last=|first=|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|others=Quer, Josep, Carlo Cecchetto &amp; Caterina Donati et al.

While the content of a signed sentence is produced manually, many grammatical functions are produced non-manually (i.e., with the face and the torso).&lt;ref&gt;Fabian Bross &amp; Daniel Hole: [https://www.glossa-journal.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/gjgl.106/ Scope-taking strategies in German Sign Language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317232058/https://www.glossa-journal.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/gjgl.106/ |date=2018-03-17 }}. In: Glossa. A Journal of General Linguistics, 2(1): 76. 1-30&lt;/ref&gt; Such functions include questions, negation, relative clauses and topicalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boudreault|first=Patrick|author2=Mayberry, Rachel I.|year=2006|title=Grammatical processing in American Sign Language: Age of first-language acquisition effects in relation to syntactic structure|journal=Language and Cognitive Processes|volume=21|issue=5|pages=608–635|doi=10.1080/01690960500139363}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASL and BSL use similar non-manual marking for yes/no questions, for example. They are shown through raised eyebrows and a forward head tilt.&lt;ref name="Baker&amp;Cokely"&gt;Baker, Charlotte, and Dennis Cokely (1980). ''American Sign Language: A teacher's resource text on grammar and culture.'' Silver Spring, MD: T.J. Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sutton-Spence&amp;Woll"&gt;Sutton-Spence, Rachel, and Bencie Woll (1998). ''The linguistics of British Sign Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some adjectival and adverbial information is conveyed through non-manual elements, but what these elements are varies from language to language. For instance, in ASL a slightly open mouth with the tongue relaxed and visible in the corner of the mouth means 'carelessly', but a similar non-manual in BSL means 'boring' or 'unpleasant'.&lt;ref name=Sutton-Spence&amp;Woll /&gt;

Discourse functions such as [[conversation analysis|turn taking]] are largely regulated through head movement and eye gaze. Since the addressee in a signed conversation must be watching the signer, a signer can avoid letting the other person have a turn by not looking at them, or can indicate that the other person may have a turn by making eye contact.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Charlotte (1977). Regulators and turn-taking in American Sign Language discourse, in Lynn Friedman, ''On the other hand: New perspectives on American Sign Language.'' New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iconicity ===
The first studies on [[iconicity]] in ASL were published in the late 1970s, and early 1980s.  Many early sign language linguists rejected the notion that iconicity was an important aspect of the language.&lt;ref&gt;Frishberg (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klima &amp; Bellugi (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; Though they recognized that certain aspects of the language seemed iconic, they considered this to be merely extralinguistic, a property which did not influence the language. However, mimetic aspects of sign language (signs that imitate, mimic, or represent) are found in abundance across a wide variety of sign languages. For example, deaf children learning sign language try to express something but do not know the associated sign, they will often invent an iconic sign that displays mimetic properties.&lt;ref&gt;Klima, Edward; Bellugi, Ursula. "The Signs of Language." Sign Language Studies, vol. 1062, no. 1, 1989, pp. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Though it never disappears from a particular sign language, iconicity is gradually weakened as forms of sign languages become more customary and are subsequently grammaticized. As a form becomes more conventional, it becomes disseminated in a methodical way phonologically to the rest of the sign language community.&lt;ref&gt;Brentari, Diane. "Introduction." Sign Languages, 2011, pp. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Frishberg (1975) wrote a very influential paper addressing the relationship between arbitrariness and iconicity in ASL. She concluded that though originally present in many signs, iconicity is degraded over time through the application of grammatical processes. In other words, over time, the natural processes of regularization in the language obscures any iconically motivated features of the sign.

Some researchers have suggested that the properties of ASL give it a clear advantage in terms of learning and memory.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] was one of the first to document this benefit. In his study, Brown found that when children were taught signs that had high levels of iconic mapping they were significantly more likely to recall the signs in a later memory task than when they were taught signs that had little or no iconic properties.

A central task for the pioneers of sign language linguistics was trying to prove that ASL was a real language and not merely a collection of gestures or "English on the hands." One of the prevailing beliefs at this time was that 'real languages' must consist of an arbitrary relationship between form and meaning. Thus, if ASL consisted of signs that had iconic form-meaning relationship, it could not be considered a real language. As a result, iconicity as a whole was largely neglected in research of sign languages.

The [[cognitive linguistics]] perspective rejects a more traditional definition of iconicity as a relationship between linguistic form and a concrete, real-world referent. Rather it is a set of selected correspondences between the form and meaning of a sign.&lt;ref name="Taub 2001"&gt;Taub (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, iconicity is grounded in a language user's mental representation ("[[construal]]" in [[cognitive grammar]]). It is defined as a fully grammatical and central aspect of a sign language rather than a peripheral phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The cognitive linguistics perspective allows for some signs to be fully iconic or partially iconic given the number of correspondences between the possible parameters of form and meaning.&lt;ref name="Wilcox 2000"&gt;Wilcox (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the [[Israeli Sign Language]] (ISL) sign for "ask" has parts of its form that are iconic ("movement away from the mouth" means "something coming from the mouth"), and parts that are arbitrary (the handshape, and the orientation).&lt;ref name="Meir 2010"&gt;Meir (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many signs have [[metaphoric]] mappings as well as iconic or metonymic ones. For these signs there are three way correspondences between a form, a concrete source and an abstract target meaning. The ASL sign LEARN has this three way correspondence. The abstract target meaning is "learning". The concrete source is putting objects into the head from books. The form is a grasping hand moving from an open palm to the forehead. The iconic correspondence is between form and concrete source. The metaphorical correspondence is between concrete source and abstract target meaning. Because the concrete source is connected to two correspondences linguistics refer to metaphorical signs as "double mapped".&lt;ref name="Taub 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilcox 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meir 2010"/&gt;

Although sign languages have emerged naturally in deaf communities alongside or among spoken languages, they are unrelated to spoken languages and have different grammatical structures at their core.

Sign languages may be classified by how they arise.

In non-signing communities, [[home sign]] is not a full language, but closer to a [[pidgin]]. Home sign is amorphous and generally idiosyncratic to a particular family, where a deaf child does not have contact with other deaf children and is not educated in sign. Such systems are not generally passed on from one generation to the next. Where they are passed on, [[creole genesis|creolization]] would be expected to occur, resulting in a full language.  However, home sign may also be closer to full language in communities where the hearing population has a gestural mode of language; examples include various [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]] and gestural systems across West Africa, such as [[Mofu-Gudur Sign Language|Mofu-Gudur]] in Cameroon.

A [[village sign language]] is a local indigenous language that typically arises over several generations in a relatively insular community with a high incidence of deafness, and is used both by the deaf and by a significant portion of the hearing community, who have deaf family and friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Meir |first1= Irit |last2= Sandler |first2= Wendy |last3= Padden |first3= Carol |author-link3= Carol Padden |last4= Aronoff |first4= Mark |author-link4= Mark Aronoff |year= 2010 |chapter= Chapter 18: Emerging sign languages |chapter-url= http://sandlersignlab.haifa.ac.il/html/html_eng/pdf/EMERGING_SIGN_LANGUAGES.pdf |chapter-format=

[[Deaf-community sign language]]s, on the other hand, arise where deaf people come together to form their own communities. These include school sign, such as [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], which develop in the student bodies of deaf schools which do not use sign as a language of instruction, as well as community languages such as [[Bamako Sign Language]], which arise where generally uneducated deaf people congregate in urban centers for employment. At first, Deaf-community sign languages are not generally known by the hearing population, in many cases not even by close family members. However, they may grow, in some cases becoming a language of instruction and receiving official recognition, as in the case of ASL.

Both contrast with [[speech taboo|speech-taboo]] languages such as the various [[Aboriginal Australian sign languages]], which are developed by the hearing community and only used secondarily by the deaf. It is doubtful whether most of these are languages in their own right, rather than manual codes of spoken languages, though a few such as [[Yolngu Sign Language]] are independent of any particular spoken language. Hearing people may also develop sign to communicate with speakers of other languages, as in [[Plains Indian Sign Language]]; this was a contact signing system or [[pidgin]] that was evidently not used by deaf people in the Plains nations, though it presumably influenced home sign.

[[Language contact]] and [[creole language|creolization]] is common in the development of sign languages, making clear family classifications difficult&amp;nbsp;– it is often unclear whether lexical similarity is due to borrowing or a common parent language, or whether there was one or several parent languages, such as several village languages merging into a Deaf-community language. Contact occurs between sign languages, between sign and spoken languages ([[contact sign]], a kind of pidgin), and between sign languages and [[gesture|gestural systems]] used by the broader community. One author has speculated that [[Adamorobe Sign Language]], a village sign language of Ghana, may be related to the "gestural trade jargon used in the markets throughout West Africa", in vocabulary and [[areal feature]]s including prosody and phonetics.&lt;ref&gt;Frishberg (1987). See also the classification of [[Henri Wittmann|Wittmann]] (1991) for the general issue of jargons as prototypes in sign language genesis.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lao sign language 025.jpg|thumb|Young students learn some words of [[Lao sign language]] from Suliphone, a deaf artist. This was one of several activities at a school book party sponsored by Big Brother Mouse, a literacy project in [[Laos]] where Suliphone works.]]
* [[British Sign Language|BSL]], [[Auslan]] and [[NZSL]] are usually considered to be a language known as [[BANZSL]]. [[Maritime Sign Language]] and [[South African Sign Language]] are also related to BSL.&lt;ref&gt;See Gordon (2008), under nsr {{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=nsr |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604014547/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=nsr |archivedate=2011-06-04 |df= }} and sfs {{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=sfs |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921104537/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=sfs |archivedate=2008-09-21 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Danish Sign Language]] and its descendants [[Norwegian Sign Language]] and [[Icelandic Sign Language]] are largely mutually intelligible with [[Swedish Sign Language]]. [[Finnish Sign Language]] and [[Portuguese Sign Language]] derive from Swedish SL, though with local admixture in the case of mutually unintelligible Finnish SL.{{clarify|date=September 2014}} Danish SL has French SL influence and Wittmann (1991) places them in that family, though he proposes that Swedish, Finnish, and Portuguese SL are instead related to [[British Sign Language]].
* [[Indian Sign Language]] ISL is similar to [[Pakistani Sign Language]]. (ISL fingerspelling uses both hands, similarly to British Sign Language.).
* [[Japanese Sign Language]], [[Taiwanese Sign Language]] and [[Korean Sign Language]] are thought to be members of a [[Japanese Sign Language family]].&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Susan D. ''et al.'' (2010). "Variation in East Asian Sign Language Structures" in {{Google books|xI0uqGyrsN8C|''Sign Languages,'' p. 499.|page=499}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[French Sign Language family]]. There are a number of sign languages that emerged from [[French Sign Language]] (LSF), or are the result of language contact between local community sign languages and LSF. These include: [[French Sign Language]], [[Italian Sign Language]], [[Quebec Sign Language]], [[American Sign Language]], [[Irish Sign Language]], [[Russian Sign Language]], [[Dutch Sign Language]] (NGT), [[Spanish Sign Language]], [[Mexican Sign Language]], [[Brazilian Sign Language|Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS)]], [[Catalan Sign Language]], [[Ukrainian Sign Language]], [[Austrian Sign Language]] (along with its twin [[Hungarian Sign Language]] and its offspring [[Czech Sign Language]]) and others.
** A subset of this group includes languages that have been heavily influenced by American Sign Language (ASL), or are regional varieties of ASL. [[Bolivian Sign Language]] is sometimes considered a dialect of ASL. [[Thai Sign Language]] is a [[mixed language]] derived from ASL and the native sign languages of Bangkok and Chiang Mai, and may be considered part of the ASL family. Others possibly influenced by ASL include [[Ugandan Sign Language]], [[Kenyan Sign Language]], [[Philippine Sign Language]] and [[Malaysian Sign Language]].
* [[German Sign Language]] (DGS) gave rise to [[Polish Sign Language]]; it also at least strongly influenced [[Israeli Sign Language]], though it is unclear whether the latter derives from DGS or from [[Austrian Sign Language]], which is in the French family.
* [[Lyons Sign Language]] may be the source of [[Flemish Sign Language]] (VGT) though this is unclear.
* According to an [http://www.sil.org/silesr/abstract.asp?ref=2005-026 SIL report], the sign languages of Russia, Moldova and Ukraine share a high degree of lexical similarity and may be dialects of one language, or distinct related languages. The same report suggested a "cluster" of sign languages centered around [[Czech Sign Language]], [[Hungarian Sign Language]] and [[Slovak Sign Language]]. This group may also include [[Romanian Sign Language|Romanian]], [[Bulgarian Sign Language|Bulgarian]], and [[Polish Sign Language|Polish]] sign languages.
* Sign languages of [[Jordanian Sign Language|Jordan]], Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Iraq (and possibly [[Saudi Sign Language|Saudi Arabia]]) may be part of a [[sprachbund]], or may be one dialect of a larger [[Eastern Arabic Sign Language]].
* Known [[Language isolate#Sign language isolates|isolates]] include [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], [[Turkish Sign Language]], [[Kata Kolok]], [[Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language]] and [[Providence Island Sign Language]].

The only comprehensive classification along these lines going beyond a simple listing of languages dates back to 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Wittmann (1991). The classification is said to be typological satisfying Jakobson's condition of genetic interpretability.&lt;/ref&gt; The classification is based on the 69 sign languages from the 1988 edition of [[Ethnologue]] that were known at the time of the 1989 conference on sign languages in Montreal and 11 more languages the author added after the conference.&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann's classification went into [[Ethnologue]]'s database where it is still cited.{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/bibliography.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725072840/http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/bibliography.asp |archivedate=2008-07-25 |df= }} The subsequent edition of Ethnologue in 1992 went up to 81 sign languages, ultimately adopting Wittmann's distinction between primary and alternate sign languages (going back ultimately to Stokoe 1974) and, more vaguely, some other traits from his analysis. The 2013 version (17th edition) of [[Ethnologue]] is now up to 137 sign languages.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his classification, the author distinguishes between primary and auxiliary sign languages&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann adds that this taxonomic criterion is not really applicable with any scientific rigor: Auxiliary sign languages, to the extent that they are full-fledged natural languages (and therefore included in his survey) at all, are mostly used by the deaf as well, and some primary sign languages (such as ASL and [[Adamorobe Sign Language]]) have acquired auxiliary usages.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as between single languages and names that are thought to refer to more than one language.&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann includes in this class [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]] (at least 14 different languages), [[Monastic sign language]], Thai Hill-Country sign languages (possibly including languages in Vietnam and Laos), and [[Sri Lankan sign languages]] (14 deaf schools with different sign languages).&lt;/ref&gt; The prototype-A class of languages includes all those sign languages that seemingly cannot be derived from any other language.&lt;ref name=pro-A&gt;These are [[Adamorobe Sign Language]], [[Armenian Sign Language]], [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]], Hindu [[mudra]], the [[Monastic sign languages]], [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language]], [[Plains Indian Sign Language]], [[Urubú-Kaapor Sign Language]], [[Chinese Sign Language]], [[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language]] (Pakistani SL is said to be R, but Indian SL to be A, though they are the same language), [[Japanese Sign Language]], and maybe the various [[Thai Hill-Country sign languages]], [[French Sign Language]], [[Lyons Sign Language]], and [[Mayan sign languages|Nohya Maya Sign Language]]. Wittmann also includes, bizarrely, Chinese characters and Egyptian hieroglyphs.&lt;/ref&gt; Prototype-R languages are languages that are remotely modelled on a prototype-A language (in many cases thought to have been French Sign Language) by a process Kroeber (1940) called "[[stimulus diffusion]]".&lt;ref name=pro-R&gt;These are [[Providencia Island Sign Language|Providencia Island]], [[Kod Tangan Bahasa Malaysia]] (manually signed Malay), [[German Sign Language|German]], [[Ecuadorian Sign Language|Ecuadoran]], [[Salvadoran Sign Language|Salvadoran]], [[Gestuno]], [[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language|Indo-Pakistani]] (Pakistani SL is said to be R, but Indian SL to be A, though they are the same language), [[Kenyan Sign Language|Kenyan]], [[Brazilian Sign Language|Brazilian]], [[Spanish Sign Language|Spanish]], [[Nepali Sign Language|Nepali]] (with possible admixture), [[Penang Sign Language|Penang]], [[Rennellese Sign Language|Rennellese]], [[Saudi Sign Language|Saudi]], the various [[Sri Lankan sign languages]], and perhaps BSL, [[Peruvian Sign Language|Peruvian]], [[Tijuana Sign Language|Tijuana]] (spurious), [[Venezuelan Sign Language|Venezuelan]], and [[Nicaraguan Sign Language|Nicaraguan]] sign languages.&lt;/ref&gt; The families of [[BANZSL|BSL]], [[German Sign Language|DGS]], [[Japanese Sign Language|JSL]], [[French Sign Language|LSF]] (and possibly [[Lyons Sign Language|LSG]]) were the products of [[creolization]] and [[relexification]] of prototype languages.&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann's references on the subject, besides his own work on [[creolization]] and [[relexification]] in spoken languages, include papers such as Fischer (1974, 1978), Deuchar (1987) and Judy Kegl's pre-1991 work on creolization in sign languages.&lt;/ref&gt; Creolization is seen as enriching overt morphology in sign languages, as compared to reducing overt morphology in spoken languages.&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann's explanation for this is that models of acquisition and transmission for sign languages are not based on any typical parent-child relation model of direct transmission which is inducive to variation and change to a greater extent. He notes that sign creoles are much more common than vocal creoles and that we can't know on how many successive creolizations prototype-A sign languages are based prior to their historicity.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Typology ===
{{See also|Linguistic typology}}

Linguistic typology (going back to [[Edward Sapir]]) is based on word structure and distinguishes [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] classes such as [[Agglutination|agglutinating]]/concatenating, [[Inflexion|inflectional]], polysynthetic, incorporating, and isolating ones.

Sign languages vary in word-order typology. For example, [[Austrian Sign Language]], [[Japanese Sign Language]] and [[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language]] are [[Subject-object-verb]] while [[ASL]] is [[Subject-verb-object]]. Influence from the surrounding spoken languages is not improbable.

Sign languages tend to be incorporating classifier languages, where a classifier handshape representing the object is incorporated into those transitive verbs which allow such modification. For a similar group of intransitive verbs (especially motion verbs), it is the subject which is incorporated. Only in a very few sign languages (for instance [[Japanese Sign Language]]) are agents ever incorporated. in this way, since subjects of intransitives are treated similarly to objects of transitives, incorporation in sign languages can be said to follow an ergative pattern.

Brentari&lt;ref name="Brentari1998"&gt;Brentari, Diane (1998): A prosodic model of sign language phonology. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press; cited in Hohenberger (2007) on p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brentari, Diane (2002): Modality differences in sign language phonology and morphophonemics. In: Richard P. Meier, Kearsy Cormier, and David Quinto-Pozos (eds.), 35–36; cited in Hohenberger (2007) on p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; classifies sign languages as a whole group determined by the medium of communication (visual instead of auditory) as one group with the features monosyllabic and polymorphemic. That means, that one syllable (i.e. one word, one sign) can express several morphemes, e.g., subject and object of a verb determine the direction of the verb's movement (inflection).

Another aspect of typology that has been studied in sign languages is their systems for [[Cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;Ulrike Zeshan, Cesar Ernesto Escobedo Delgado, Hasan Dikyuva, Sibaji Panda, and Connie de Vos. 2013. Cardinal numerals in rural sign languages: Approaching cross-modal typology. Linguistic Typology 17: 357–396.&lt;/ref&gt; Typologically significant differences have been found between sign languages.

=== Acquisition ===
{{See also|Language acquisition}}

Children who are exposed to a sign language from birth will acquire it, just as hearing children acquire their native spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Emmorey|first=Karen|title=Language, Cognition, and the Brain|year=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Critical Period hypothesis suggests that language, spoken or signed, is more easily acquired as a child at a young age versus an adult because of the plasticity of the child's brain. In a study done at the University of McGill, they found that American Sign Language users who acquired the language natively (from birth) performed better when asked to copy videos of ASL sentences than ASL users who acquired the language later in life. They also found that there are differences in the grammatical morphology of ASL sentences between the two groups, all suggesting that there is a very important critical period in learning signed languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acfos.org/publication/ourarticles/pdf/acfos1/mayberry.pdf|title=The Critical Period for Language Acquisition and The Deaf Child's Language Comprehension: A Psycholinguistic Approach|last=Mayberry|first=Rachel|date=|website=ACFOS|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201072124/http://www.acfos.org/publication/ourarticles/pdf/acfos1/mayberry.pdf|archivedate=2017-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acquisition of non-manual features follows an interesting pattern: When a word that always has a particular non-manual feature associated with it (such as a wh- question word) is learned, the non-manual aspects are attached to the word but don’t have the flexibility associated with adult use. At a certain point, the non-manual features are dropped and the word is produced with no facial expression. After a few months, the non-manuals reappear, this time being used the way adult signers would use them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advances in the Sign Language Development of Deaf Children|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Cary, NC|isbn=978-0-19-803996-9|pages=262–290|author=Reilly, Judy|editor1=Brenda Schick |editor2=Marc Marschack |editor3=Patricia Elizabeth Spencer |chapter=How Faces Come to Serve Grammar: The Development of Nonmanual Morphology in American Sign Language}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Written forms ===
{{anchor|Notation}}&lt;!-- [[Sign language notation]] redirects here --&gt;
Sign languages do not have a traditional or formal written form. Many deaf people do not see a need to write their own language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hopkins | first1 = Jason | year = 2008 | title = Choosing how to write sign language: a sociolinguistic perspective | url = | journal = [[International Journal of the Sociology of Language]] | volume = 192 | issue = | pages = 75–90 | doi=10.1515/ijsl.2008.036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several ways to represent sign languages in written form have been developed.

* [[Stokoe notation]], devised by Dr. [[William Stokoe]] for his 1965 ''Dictionary of American Sign Language'',&lt;ref name="StokoeWilliam"&gt;Stokoe, William C.; Dorothy C. Casterline; Carl G. Croneberg. 1965. ''A dictionary of American sign language on linguistic principles''. Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press&lt;/ref&gt; is an abstract [[phonemic]] notation system. Designed specifically for representing the use of the hands, it has no way of expressing facial expression or other non-manual features of sign languages. However, his was designed for research, particularly in a dictionary, not for general use.
* The [[Hamburg Notation System]] (HamNoSys), developed in the early 1990s, is a detailed phonetic system, not designed for any one sign language, and intended as a transcription system for researchers rather than as a practical script.
* [[David J. Peterson]] has attempted to create a phonetic transcription system for signing that is [[ASCII]]-friendly known as the [http://dedalvs.free.fr/slipa.html Sign Language International Phonetic Alphabet (SLIPA)].
* [[SignWriting]], developed by Valerie Sutton in 1974, is a system for representing sign languages phonetically (including [[mouthing]], facial expression and dynamics of movement). The script is sometimes used for detailed research, language documentation, as well as publishing texts and works in sign languages.
* [[si5s]] is another orthography which is largely phonemic. However, a few signs are [[logogram|logographs]] and/or [[ideograph]]s due to regional variation in sign languages.
* [[ASL-phabet]] is a system designed primarily for education of deaf children by Dr. [[Samuel James Supalla|Sam Supalla]] which uses a minimalist collection of symbols in the order of Handshape-Location-Movement. Many signs can be written the same way ([[homograph]]).

So far, there is no consensus regarding the written form of sign language.  Except for SignWriting, none are widely used. Maria Galea writes that SignWriting "is becoming widespread, uncontainable and untraceable. In the same way that works written in and about a well developed writing system such as the Latin script, the time has arrived where SW is so widespread, that it is impossible in the same way to list all works that have been produced using this writing system and that have been written about this writing system."&lt;ref name="GaleaLinguistic"&gt;{{cite book

=== Sign perception ===
For a native signer, [[American Sign Language|sign]] [[Categorical perception|perception]] influences how the mind makes sense of their visual language experience. For example, a handshape may vary based on the other signs made before or after it, but these variations are arranged in perceptual categories during its development.  The mind detects handshape contrasts but groups similar handshapes together in one category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsdj.gallaudet.edu/assets/section/section2/entry94/DSDJ_entry94.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111142013/http://dsdj.gallaudet.edu/assets/section/section2/entry94/DSDJ_entry94.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuhl | first1 = P | year = 1991 | title = Human adults and human infants show a 'perceptual magnet effect' for the prototypes of speech categories, monkeys do not | url = | journal = Perception and Psychophysics | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 93–107 | doi=10.3758/bf03212211}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morford | first1 = J.

The mind ignores some of the similarities between different perceptual categories, at the same time preserving the visual information within each perceptual category of handshape variation.

=== Deaf communities and deaf culture ===
{{Main|Deaf culture}}

When Deaf people constitute a relatively small proportion of the general population, Deaf communities often develop that are distinct from the surrounding hearing community.&lt;ref name="WollLadd2003"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These Deaf communities are very widespread in the world, associated especially with sign languages used in urban areas and throughout a nation, and the cultures they have developed are very rich.

One example of sign language variation in the Deaf community is [[Black ASL]]. This sign language was developed in the Black Deaf community as a variant during the American era of segregation and racism, where young Black Deaf students were forced to attend separate schools than their white Deaf peers.&lt;ref&gt;McCaskill, C. (2011). The hidden treasure of Black ASL: its history and structure. Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use of sign languages in hearing communities ===
On occasion, where the prevalence of deaf people is high enough, a deaf sign language has been taken up by an entire local community, forming what is sometimes called a "village sign language"&lt;ref name="ZeshanDeVos2012"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically this happens in small, tightly integrated communities with a closed gene pool. Famous examples include:
* [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language]], [[United States]]
* [[Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language]], [[Israel]]
* [[Kata Kolok]], [[Bali]]
* [[Adamorobe Sign Language]], [[Ghana]]

In such communities deaf people are generally well integrated in the general community and not socially disadvantaged, 
so much so that it is difficult to speak of a separate "Deaf" community.&lt;ref name="WollLadd2003" /&gt;

Many [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]] arose in a context of extensive speech taboos, such as during mourning and initiation rites. They are or were especially highly developed among the [[Warlpiri Sign Language|Warlpiri]], [[Warumungu people|Warumungu]], [[Dieri]], [[Kaytetye people|Kaytetye]], [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]], and [[Warlmanpa language|Warlmanpa]], and are based on their respective spoken languages.

A [[pidgin]]{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=What is the evidence that it was a pidgin?}} sign language arose among tribes of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] in the [[Great Plains]] region of [[North America]] (see [[Plains Indian Sign Language]]). It was used by hearing people to communicate among tribes with different spoken [[language]]s, as well as by deaf people. There are especially users today among the [[Crow tribe|Crow]], [[Cheyenne]], and [[Arapaho]]. Unlike Australian Aboriginal sign languages, it shares the spatial grammar of deaf sign languages.
In the 1500s, a Spanish expeditionary, [[Cabeza de Vaca]], observed natives in the western part of modern-day [[Florida]] using sign language,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} and in the mid-16th century [[Francisco de Coronado|Coronado]] mentioned that communication with the [[Tonkawa]] using signs was possible without a translator.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Whether or not these gesture systems reached the stage at which they could properly be called languages is still up for debate. There are estimates indicating that as many as 2% of Native Americans are seriously or completely deaf, a rate more than twice the national average.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Signs may also be used by hearing people for [[manual communication]] in secret situations, such as hunting, in noisy environments, underwater, through windows or at a distance.

=== Legal recognition ===
{{Main|Legal recognition of sign languages}}
Some sign languages have obtained some form of legal recognition, while others have no status at all. Sarah Batterbury has argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah C. E. Batterbury. 2012. ''Language Policy'' 11:253–272.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telecommunications ===
[[File:Deaf or HoH person at his workplace using a Video Relay Service to communicate with a hearing person via a Video Interpreter and sign language SVCC 2007 Brigitte SLI + Mark.jpg|thumb|right|A deaf person using a remote VRS interpreter to communicate with a hearing person]]

One of the first demonstrations of the ability for [[telecommunication]]s to help sign language users communicate with each other occurred when [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]]'s [[videophone]] (trademarked as the "Picturephone") was introduced to the public at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]&amp;nbsp;– two deaf users were able to freely communicate with each other between the fair and another city.&lt;ref name="BellLabs"&gt;Bell Laboratories RECORD (1969) [http://www.porticus.org/bell/pdf/picturephone.pdf A collection of several articles on the AT&amp;T Picturephone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623215926/http://www.porticus.org/bell/pdf/picturephone.pdf |date=2012-06-23 }} (then about to be released) Bell Laboratories, Pg.134–153 &amp; 160–187, Volume 47, No. 5, May/June 1969;&lt;/ref&gt; However, video communication did not become widely available until sufficient bandwidth for the high volume of video data became available in the early 2000s.

The Internet now allows deaf people to talk via a [[video link]], either with a special-purpose [[videophone]] designed for use with sign language or with "off-the-shelf" [[videotelephony|video services]] designed for use with broadband and an ordinary computer [[webcam]].  The [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands|special videophones]] that are designed for sign language communication may provide better quality than 'off-the-shelf' services and may use data compression methods specifically designed to maximize the intelligibility of sign languages. Some advanced equipment enables a person to remotely control the other person's video camera, in order to zoom in and out or to point the camera better to understand the signing.

=== Interpretation ===
{{Main|Language interpretation#Sign language}}
[[File:2017 Woodstock 022 Język migowy.jpg|thumb|A [[Polish Sign Language]] interpreter at the [[Przystanek Woodstock]] in 2017]]
In order to facilitate communication between deaf and hearing people, sign language interpreters are often used.  Such activities involve considerable effort on the part of the interpreter, since sign languages are distinct [[natural language]]s with their own [[syntax]], different from any spoken language.

The interpretation flow is normally between a sign language and a spoken language that are customarily used in the same country, such as [[French Sign Language]] (LSF) and spoken French in France, [[Spanish Sign Language]] (LSE) to spoken Spanish in Spain, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) and spoken English in the U.K., and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) and spoken English in the US and most of anglophone Canada (since BSL and ASL are distinct sign languages both used in English-speaking countries), etc. Sign language interpreters who can translate between signed and spoken languages that are not normally paired (such as between LSE and English), are also available, albeit less frequently.

With recent developments in [[artificial intelligence]] in [[computer science]], some recent [[deep learning]] based machine translation algorithms have been developed which automatically translate short videos containing sign language sentences (often simple sentence consists of only one clause) directly to written language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Huang | first=Jie | last2=Zhou | first2=Wengang | last3=Zhang | first3=Qilin | last4=Li | first4=Houqiang | last5=Li | first5=Weiping | title=Video-based Sign Language Recognition without Temporal Segmentation | website=arXiv.org e-Print archive | date=2018-01-30 | url=https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/VideobasedSignLanguageRecognitionwithoutTemporalSegmentation.pdf | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329054531/https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/VideobasedSignLanguageRecognitionwithoutTemporalSegmentation.pdf | archivedate=2018-03-29 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Remote interpreting ===
&lt;!-- Note: the following text was originally copied from [[Language interpretation#Video interpreting|Language interpretation]]
but has been adapted extensively to fit into the context of this article.

[[File:Video interpreter.svg|thumb|175px|left|Video interpreter sign used at VRS/VRI service locations]]
{{Main|Video remote interpreting|Video relay service}}

Interpreters may be physically present with both parties to the conversation but, since the technological advancements in the early 2000s, provision of interpreters in remote locations has become available.  In [[video remote interpreting]] (VRI), the two clients (a sign language user and a hearing person who wish to communicate with each other) are in one location, and the interpreter is in another. The interpreter communicates with the sign language user via a video telecommunications link, and with the hearing person by an audio link. VRI can be used for situations in which no on-site interpreters are available.

However, VRI cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. With [[video relay service]] (VRS), the sign language user, the interpreter, and the hearing person are in three separate locations, thus allowing the two clients to talk to each other on the phone through the interpreter.

=== Interpretation on television ===
[[File:Red de museos para la atencion a personas con discapacidad.webm|thumb|Video about access to cultural institutions in Mexico, with Mexican sign language interpretation and captions in Spanish]]

Sign language is sometimes provided for [[television program]]mes. The signer usually appears in the bottom corner of the screen, with the programme being [[broadcasting|broadcast]] full size or slightly shrunk away from that corner. Typically for [[press conference]]s such as those given by the [[Mayor of New York City]], the signer appears to stage left or right of the public official to allow both the speaker and signer to be in frame at the same time.

[[Paddy Ladd]] initiated deaf programming on [[United Kingdom|British]] television in the 1980s and is credited with getting sign language on television and enabling deaf children to be educated in sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Raekha | last=Prasad | title=Sound and Fury | date=2003-03-19 | publisher= | url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/mar/19/guardiansocietysupplement5 | work=Guardian Unlimited | pages= | accessdate=2008-01-30 | language= | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910210203/http://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/mar/19/guardiansocietysupplement5 | archivedate=2014-09-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional analogue broadcasting, many programmes are repeated, often in the early hours of the morning, with the signer present rather than have them appear at the main broadcast time.&lt;ref name="RNID"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnid.org.uk/howwehelp/research_and_technology/communication_and_broadcasting/signing_on_television/ |title=Sign Language on Television |accessdate=2008-01-30 |publisher=RNID |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417003132/http://www.rnid.org.uk/howwehelp/research_and_technology/communication_and_broadcasting/signing_on_television |archivedate=2009-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is due to the distraction they cause to those not wishing to see the signer.{{citation needed|date=January 2008}} On the BBC, many programmes that broadcast late at night or early in the morning are signed. Some emerging [[television]] technologies allow the viewer to turn the signer on and off in a similar manner to [[subtitles]] and [[closed captioning]].&lt;ref name="RNID"/&gt;

Legal requirements covering sign language on television vary from country to country. In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Broadcasting Act 1996]] addressed the requirements for blind and deaf viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/itc_publications/codes_guidance/sign_language_dtt/introduction.asp.html |title=ITC Guidelines on Standards for Sign Language on Digital Terrestrial Television |accessdate=2008-01-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423180334/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/itc_publications/codes_guidance/sign_language_dtt/introduction.asp.html |archivedate=2007-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but has since been replaced by the [[Communications Act 2003]].

=== Language endangerment ===
As with any spoken language, sign languages are also vulnerable to becoming [[Endangered languages|endangered]]. For example, a sign language used by a small community may be endangered and even abandoned as users [[Language shift|shift]] to a sign language used by a larger community, as has happened with [[Hawai'i Sign Language]], which is almost extinct except for a few elderly signers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/hps|title=Did you know Hawai'i Sign Language is critically endangered?|website=Endangered Languages|access-date=2016-02-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307065744/http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/hps|archivedate=2016-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sl_dDVctycgC|title=International Encyclopedia of Linguistics|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195139778|language=en|quote=The language is considered to be endangered. 9,600 deaf people in Hawaii now use American Sign Language with a few local signs for place-names and cultural items.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even national sign languages can be endangered; for example, New Zealand Sign Language is losing users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite

== Communication systems similar to sign language ==
There are a number of communication systems that are similar in some respects to sign languages, while not having all the characteristics of a full sign language, particularly its grammatical structure. Many of these are either precursors to natural sign languages or are derived from them.

=== Manual codes for spoken languages ===
{{Main|Manually coded language}}

When Deaf and Hearing people interact, signing systems may be developed that use signs drawn from a natural sign language but used according to the grammar of the spoken language. In particular, when people devise one-for-one sign-for-word correspondences between spoken words (or even [[morphemes]]) and signs that represent them, the system that results is a manual code for a spoken language, rather than a natural sign language. Such systems may be invented in an attempt to help teach Deaf children the spoken language, and generally are not used outside an educational context.

=== "Baby sign language" with hearing children ===
{{Main|Baby sign language}}

It has become popular for hearing parents to teach signs (from ASL or some other sign language) to young hearing children.  Since the muscles in babies' hands grow and develop quicker than their mouths, signs can be a beneficial option for better communication.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor-DiLeva, Kim. Once Upon A Sign : Using American Sign Language To Engage, Entertain, And Teach All Children, p. 15. Libraries Unlimited, 2011. eBook Collection (EBSCOhost). Web. 29 Feb. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Babies can usually produce signs before they can speak.  This reduces the confusion between parents when trying to figure out what their child wants.  When the child begins to speak, signing is usually abandoned, so the child does not progress to acquiring the grammar of the sign language.

This is in contrast to hearing children who grow up with Deaf parents, who generally acquire the full sign language natively, the same as Deaf children of Deaf parents.

=== Home sign ===
{{Main|Home sign}}

Informal, rudimentary sign systems are sometimes developed within a single family. For instance, when hearing parents with no sign language skills have a deaf child, the child may develop a system of signs naturally, unless repressed by the parents. The term for these mini-languages is [[home sign]] (sometimes "home sign" or "kitchen sign").&lt;ref&gt;Susan Goldin-Meadow (Goldin-Meadow 2003, Van Deusen, Goldin-Meadow &amp; Miller 2001) has done extensive work on home sign systems. [[Adam Kendon]] (1988) published a seminal study of the homesign system of a deaf [[Enga Province|Enga]] woman from the [[Papua New Guinea]] highlands, with special emphasis on [[iconicity]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Home sign arises due to the absence of any other way to communicate. Within the span of a single lifetime and without the support or feedback of a community, the child naturally invents signs to help meet his or her communication needs, and may even develop a few grammatical rules for combining short sequences of signs. Still, this kind of system is inadequate for the intellectual development of a child and it comes nowhere near meeting the standards linguists use to describe a complete language. No type of home sign is recognized as a full language.&lt;ref&gt;The one possible exception to this is Rennellese Sign Language, which has the [[ISO 639-3]] code [rsi]. It only ever had one deaf user, and thus appears to have been a home sign system that was mistakenly-accepted into the ISO 639-3 standard. It has been proposed for deletion from the standard. ({{cite web|title=Change Request Number: 2016-002|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2016-002.pdf|website=ISO 639-3|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=2016-07-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128214659/http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2016-002.pdf|archivedate=2016-01-28|df=}})&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gestural theory of human language origins ===
{{Main|Origin of language#Gestural theory|l1=Origin of language § Gestural theory}}

One theory of the evolution of human language states that it developed first as a gestural system, which later shifted to speech.&lt;ref&gt;Hewes (1973), Premack &amp; Premack (1983), Kimura (1993), Newman (2002), Wittmann (1980, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; An important question for this gestural theory is what caused the shift to vocalization.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb &amp; Whishaw (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59617">The '''social structure of the [[United Kingdom]]''' has historically been highly influenced by the concept of [[social class]], which continues to affect British society today.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2712372/Harriet-Harman-Social-class-is-still-most-important-divide-in-Britain.html Harriet Harman: Social class is still most important divide in Britain.] www.telegraph.co.uk, 9 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Biressi|first=Anita|title=Class and Contemporary British Culture|year=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London|isbn=9780230240568|author2=Heather Nunn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

British society, like its European neighbours and most societies in world history, was traditionally (before the Industrial Revolution) divided hierarchically within a system that involved the [[hereditary]] transmission of occupation, social status and political influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boundless.com/sociology/understanding-global-stratification-and-inequality/stratification-systems/caste/|title=Boundless Sociology - Simple Book Publishing|first=|last=Boundless|date=|website=www.boundless.com|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the advent of [[industrialisation]], this system has been in a constant state of revision, and new factors other than birth (for example, [[education]]) are now a greater part of creating identity in Britain.

Although definitions of social class in the United Kingdom vary and are highly controversial, most are influenced by factors of wealth, occupation and education. Until recently the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] was organised on a class basis, with the [[House of Lords]] representing the hereditary upper-class and the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] representing everybody else. The British monarch is usually viewed as being at the top of the social class structure.

British society has experienced significant change since the [[World War II|Second World War]], including an expansion of [[higher education]] and [[home ownership]], a shift towards a service-dominated economy, [[mass immigration]], a changing role for women and a more individualistic culture, and these changes have had a considerable impact on the social landscape.&lt;ref name=savage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socresonline.org.uk/12/3/6.html|title=Changing Social Class Identities in Post-War Britain: Perspectives from Mass-Observation by Mike Savage|accessdate=19 October 2011|publisher=Sociological Research Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, claims that the UK has become a [[classless society]] have frequently been met with scepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/terence-blacker/uppers-downers-and-the-myth-of-classless-britain-545648.html|title=US|author=|date=|website=independent.co.uk|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fabians.org.uk/publications/extracts/cash-class|title=Fabian Society on Cash and the Classless society|author=|date=|website=fabians.org.uk|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Columnists/Column/0,5673,416483,00.html|title=Comment: Classless Britain is a myth - Columnists - guardian.co.uk|author=|date=|website=www.theguardian.com|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that social status in the United Kingdom is influenced by, although separate from, social class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chan |first1=Tak Wing|last2=Goldthorpe |first2=John |year=2004 |title=Is There a Status Order in Contemporary British Society? |journal=European Sociological Review|volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=383–401 |doi= 10.1093/esr/jch033|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sfos0006/papers/esr2004.pdf |accessdate=24 December 2011 |citeseerx=10.1.1.454.5199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
Prior to the eighteenth century, one did not speak of class or classes.  Older terms like estates, rank, and orders were predominant. This change in terminology corresponded to a general decrease in significance ascribed to hereditary characteristics, and increase in the significance of wealth and income as indicators of position in the social hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Class, Social|editor=Kuper, Adam|title=The social science encyclopedia|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2004|isbn=978-0-415-32096-2|page=111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2oES3pJufP4C&amp;pg=PA111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Penney, Robert|chapter=Class, social|editors=Christensen, Karen &amp; Levinson, David|title=Encyclopedia of community: from the village to the virtual world, Volume 1|publisher=SAGE|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7619-2598-9|page=189|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1geOjQ6R0MC&amp;pg=PA189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "class system" in the United Kingdom is widely studied in academia but no definition of the word ''class'' is universally agreed to. Some scholars may adopt the [[Marxist view of class]] where persons are classified by their relationship to [[means of production]], as owners or as workers, which is the most important factor in that person's social rank.  Alternatively, [[Max Weber]] developed a [[three-component theory of stratification]] under which "a person’s power can be shown in the social order through their status, in the economic order through their class, and in the political order through their party.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, Charles E. (2007).  ''Social Inequality Forms, Causes, and Consequences Sixth Edition''.  Allyn and Bacon Boston, MA.  {{ISBN|0-205-48436-0}}. p 202&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides these academic models, there are myriad popular explanations of class in Britain.  In the work ''Class'', [[Jilly Cooper]] quotes a shopkeeper on the subject of [[bacon]]: "When a woman asks for [[Bacon#Cuts|back]] I call her 'madam'; when she asks for [[Bacon#Cuts|streaky]] I call her 'dear'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/mar/08/how-to-cook-perfect-bacon-sandwiches | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Felicity | last=Cloake | title=How to cook the perfect bacon sandwich | date=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The United Kingdom never experienced the sudden dispossession of the estates of the [[nobility]], which occurred in much of Europe after the [[French Revolution]] or in the early 20th century, and the British nobility, in so far as it existed as a distinct social class, integrated itself with those with new wealth derived from commercial and industrial sources more comfortably than in most of Europe. Opportunities resulting from consistent economic growth and the expanding [[British Empire]] also enabled some from much poorer backgrounds (generally men who had managed to acquire some education) to rise through the class system.

The historian [[David Cannadine]] sees the period around 1880 as a peak after which the position of the old powerful families declined rapidly, from a number of causes, reaching a nadir in the years after World War II, symbolised by the widespread [[Destruction of country houses in 20th-century Britain|destruction of country houses]].  However their wealth, if not their political power, has rebounded strongly since the 1980s, benefiting from greatly increased values of the land and fine art which many owned in quantity.

Meanwhile, the complex British middle-classes had also been enjoying a long period of growth and increasing prosperity, and achieving political power at the national level to a degree unusual in Europe. They avoided the strict stratification of many Continental middle-classes, and formed a large and amorphous group closely connected at their edges with both the gentry and aristocracy and the labouring classes. In particular the great financial centre of the [[City of London]] was open to outsiders to an unusual degree, and continually expanding and creating new employment.

The British working class, on the other hand, was not notable in Europe for prosperity,&lt;ref name=PG1944&gt;{{cite book |last=Engels |first=Frederick |authorlink=Frederick Engels |others=Translated by Florence Kelley Wischnewetzky |title=The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 |edition=January 1943 George Allen &amp; Unwin reprint of the March 1892 edition by David Price |publisher=Project Gutenberg |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17306/17306-h/17306-h.htm |accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Early Modern British travellers often remarked on the high standard of living of the farm-workers and artisans of the [[Netherlands]], though the peasantry in other countries such as France were remarked on as poorer than their English equivalents.  Living standards certainly improved greatly over the period, more so in England than other parts of the United Kingdom, but the [[Industrial Revolution]] was marked by extremely harsh working conditions and poor housing until about the middle of the 19th century.

==Formal classifications==

===Early modern===
At the time of the formation of Great Britain in 1707, England and Scotland had similar class-based social structures. Some basic categories covering most of the British population around 1500 to 1700 are as follows.&lt;ref&gt;John Rule, ''Albion's people: English society 1714-1815'' (Routledge, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Cannadine, ''Class in Britain'' (Penguin UK, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Class
! Characteristics
|-
|[[Villein|Cottagers]] and labourers; servants
|Cottagers were a step below husbandmen, in that they had to work for others for wages. Lowest order of the working castes; perhaps [[Vagrancy (people)|vagabonds]], drifters, criminals or other outcasts would be lower. [[Slavery in England]] died out by 1200 CE.  Most young women of middle and lower ranks became servants to neighboring families for a few years before marriage.  Servants in husbandry were unmarried men hired on annual contracts as farm workers.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Kussmaul, ''Servants in husbandry in early modern England'' (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; 
|-
|[[Husbandman]] (or other tradesmen)
|A tradesman or farmer who either rented a home or owned very little land was a husbandman. In feudal times, this person likely would have been a serf, and paid a large portion of his work or produce to the land-holding lord.
|-
|[[Yeoman]]
|The yeoman class generally included small farmers who held a reasonable amount of land and were able to protect themselves from neighbouring lords et cetera. They played a military role as longbowmen before 1500. The village shopkeeper was placed between yeoman and gentry in the modern social hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Youngs, ''Sixteenth-Century England'' (1984), pp 47-65&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|Clergy.
|Clergy were mostly located in rural areas, where they were under the direction of the gentry.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace Notestein, ''English people on the eve of colonization, 1603-1630'' (1954) pp 61-69.&lt;/ref&gt; A bishop had the status of nobility, and sat in the House of Lords, but his son did not inherit the title.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Collinson,  "Episcopacy and reform in England in the later sixteenth century." ''Studies in Church History'' 3 (1966): 91-125.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Gentry]]/[[gentleman]]
|The gentry by definition held enough assets to live on land rents without working, and so could be well educated. If they worked it was in law, as priests, in politics, or in other educated pursuits without manual labour. The term Esquire was used for landowners who were not knighted. They typically possess estates worked by tenants and laborers. It was prestigious to purchase a military or naval commission for a likely son.&lt;ref&gt;Notestein, ''English people on the eve of colonization, 1603-1630'' (1954) pp 45-60.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|Professionals and businessman.
|Urban professionals included lawyers, with the highest status going to the London barristers and the [[Inns of Court]]. Physicians were rising in status as professionalization and education built upon rapidly increasing knowledge bases.  Merchants and businessmen could range in status from middle to high, depending on their wealth and importance. If they wanted high social prestige, they would buy a landed estate or negotiate for a knighthood or a baronetcy.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter, ''The Penguin Social History of Britain: English Society in the Eighteenth Century'' (Penguin UK, 1990) pp 77-83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Notestein, ''English people on the eve of colonization, 1603-1630'' (1954) pp 86-115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary O'Day, ''The professions in Early Modern England, 1450-1800'' (Routledge, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Knight]]
| The role of knighthood was very important in the medieval period, with the role of organizing local military forces on behalf of a senior noble.  However, by 1600 the title was an honorific one, often granted to outstanding combat soldiers in the king's army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur F Kinney et al. eds.|title=Tudor England: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nHasAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA410|year=2000|pages=410–11|isbn=9781136745300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Baronet]] (hereditary, non peer)
|A baronet held a hereditary style of knighthood, giving the highest rank below a peerage.
|-
| Aristocracy: [[peerage|Peer]] ([[Nobility|Noble]])
| The ranks ranged from baron to duke.  The rules of succession were elaborate—usually the eldest son inherited the title and the wealth.  When the male line expired, so too did the title (but the family kept the land). The peers were generally large land holders, often with a house in London. They sat in the House of Lords and often played a role in court, which was a very expensive undertaking subsidized by payoffs and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Notestein, ''English people on the eve of colonization, 1603-1630'' (1954) pp 36-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland and Scotland had entirely separate aristocracies; their nobles sat in their own parliaments but not in the English House of Lords.&lt;ref&gt;Keith M.

Class was defined and measured according to the amount and kind of economic, cultural, and social resources, "capitals", reported. [[Economic capital#Social science|Economic capital]] was defined as [[income]] and [[asset]]s; [[cultural capital]] as amount and type of cultural interests and activities, and [[social capital]] as the quantity and [[social status]] of their [[Friendship|friend]]s, [[family]] and personal and business contacts.&lt;ref name=BBCResults4213 /&gt; This theoretical framework was inspired by that of [[Pierre Bourdieu#Bourdieu's theory of class distinction|Pierre Bourdieu]], who published his [[La Distinction|theory of social distinction]] in 1979.

====Results====
Analysis of the survey revealed seven classes: a wealthy "elite;" a prosperous salaried "middle class" consisting of professionals and managers; a class of technical experts; a class of ‘new affluent’ workers, and at the lower levels of the class structure, in addition to an ageing traditional working class, a ‘precariat’ characterised by very low levels of capital, and a group of emergent service workers. The fracturing of the middle sectors of the social structure into distinguishable factions separated by generational, economic, cultural, and social characteristics was considered notable by the authors of the research.&lt;ref name = "Page 2 New Model" &gt;Page 2 [http://soc.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/03/12/0038038513481128.full.pdf "A New Model of Social Class: Findings from the BBC’s Great British Class Survey Experiment"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pages 11 to 15" &gt;Pages 11 to 15 [http://soc.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/03/12/0038038513481128.full.pdf "A New Model of Social Class: Findings from the BBC’s Great British Class Survey Experiment"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Elite=====
Members of the elite class are the top 6% of British society with very high economic capital (particularly savings), high social capital, and very 'highbrow' cultural capital. Occupations such as [[chief executive officer]]s, [[Information technology|IT and telecommunications directors]], [[marketing]] and [[sales]] directors; functional [[Management|manager]]s and directors, [[solicitors]], [[barrister]]s and [[judge]]s, [[Chief financial officer|financial manager]]s, [[academia#United Kingdom|higher education teachers]],&lt;ref name="Professor salaries break the scale"&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor salaries break the scale|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/209290.article|publisher=Times Higher Education|accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[dentist]]s, doctors and [[advertising]] and [[public relations]] directors were strongly represented.&lt;ref name = "Pages 12 and 13" &gt;Pages 12 and 13 [http://soc.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/03/12/0038038513481128.full.pdf "A New Model of Social Class: Findings from the BBC’s Great British Class Survey Experiment"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, those in the established and 'acceptable' professions, such as academia, law and medicine are more traditional upper middle class identifiers, with IT and sales being the preserve of the economic if not social middle class.

=====Established middle class=====
Members of the established middle class, about 25% of British society, reported high economic capital, high status of mean social contacts, and both high highbrow and high emerging cultural capital. Well-represented occupations included [[electrical engineer]]s, [[occupational therapist]]s, [[midwive]]s, environmental professionals, quality assurance and regulatory professionals, town planning officials, and special needs teaching professionals.&lt;ref name = "Pages 12 to 14" &gt;Pages 12 to 14 [http://soc.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/03/12/0038038513481128.full.pdf "A New Model of Social Class: Findings from the BBC’s Great British Class Survey Experiment"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Technical middle class=====
The technical middle class, about 6% of British society, shows high economic capital, very high status of social contacts, but relatively few contacts reported, and moderate cultural capital. Occupations represented include [[Radiology|medical radiographers]], [[Pilot (aircraft)|aircraft pilot]]s, [[pharmacist]]s, [[scientist|natural and social science professionals]] and [[scientist|physical scientists]], and [[Businessperson|business]], [[researcher|research]], and [[Administrator (business)|administrative]] positions.&lt;ref name = "Pages 12 and 14" &gt;Pages 12 and 14 [http://soc.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/03/12/0038038513481128.full.pdf "A New Model of Social Class: Findings from the BBC’s Great British Class Survey Experiment"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====New affluent workers=====
New affluent workers, about 15% of British society, show moderately good economic capital, relatively poor status of social contacts, though highly varied, and moderate highbrow but good emerging cultural capital. Occupations include [[electrician]]s and electrical fitters; [[postal worker]]s; retail [[cashier#retail|cashier]]s and checkout operatives; [[plumber]]s and heating and ventilation engineers; sales and retail assistants; housing officers; kitchen and catering assistants; quality assurance technicians.&lt;ref name = "Pages 12 and 14" /&gt;

=====Traditional working class=====
The traditional working class, about 14% of British society, shows relatively poor economic capital, but some housing assets, few social contacts, and low highbrow and emerging cultural capital. Typical occupations include electrical and [[electronics technician]]s; [[care work]]ers; [[janitor|cleaners]]; [[truck driver|van drivers]]; [[electrician]]s; [[Care work|residential, day, and domiciliary care]]
&lt;ref name = "Pages 12 and 14" /&gt;

=====Emergent service sector=====
The emergent service sector, about 19% of British society, shows relatively poor economic capital, but reasonable household income, moderate social contacts, high emerging (but low highbrow) cultural capital. Typical occupations include [[bartender|bar staff]], [[chef]]s, [[Unlicensed assistive personnel|nursing auxiliaries and assistants]], assemblers and routine operatives, [[care work]]ers, elementary storage occupations, customer service occupations, and [[musician]]s.&lt;ref name = "Pages 12 and 14" /&gt;

=====Precariat=====
The precariat, about 15% of British society, shows poor economic capital, and the lowest scores on every other criterion. Typical occupations include [[janitor|cleaners]], [[Delivery (commerce)|van drivers]], [[care worker]]s, [[carpenter]]s and [[joiner]]s, [[Property caretaker|caretaker]]s, leisure and travel service occupations, [[shopkeeper]]s and proprietors, and [[cashier#retail|retail cashiers]].&lt;ref name = "Pages 12, 14, and 15" &gt;Pages 12, 14, and 15 [http://soc.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/03/12/0038038513481128.full.pdf "A New Model of Social Class: Findings from the BBC’s Great British Class Survey Experiment"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informal classifications and stereotypes==

===Underclass===
[[File:Ferrier Estate.jpg|thumb|Many unemployed people rely on the [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare payments]] and are housed in [[Social housing in the United Kingdom|social housing]], such as council estates]].
{{See also|Underclass}}
The term "underclass" is used to refer to those people who are "chronically unemployed", and in many instances have been for generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/614168/underclass|title=Social Class (social differentiation)|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical characteristics are:
* Long-term unemployment, sometimes for generations.
* Living in council housing.

There is a contention that there are homologies between the meaning context and tenor of the abusive popular word "[[chav]]" and the term "underclass" in media discourses: the obvious difference being the former relates to supposed dispositions of a social class in consumption and the later to difficulties of a social class in productive labour relations.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, K. and Yar, M., 2006. The ‘chav’ phenomenon: Consumption, media and the construction of a new underclass. Crime, Media, Culture, 2(1), pp.9-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The "underclass" has also been blamed for the [[2011 England riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/9128779/How-we-can-turn-the-underclass-around.html|title=How we can turn the underclass around|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|author=Charlie Taylor|date=7 March 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14488486|title=England riots: The return of the underclass|publisher=bbc.co.uk|author=Mark Easton|date=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Working class===

====Unskilled and semi-skilled working class====
Traditionally, these people would have worked as [[manual labourers]]. They would typically have left school as soon as legally permissible and not have been able to take part in [[higher education]].&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt; Many would go on to work in semi-skilled and unskilled jobs on the assembly lines and machine shops of Britain's major [[car factories]], [[steel mills]], [[coal mines]], [[foundries]] and [[textile mills]] in the highly industrialised cities in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], [[North of England]], [[South Wales]] and the [[Scottish Lowlands]].

However, since the mid-1970s and early-1980s, [[de-industrialisation]] has shattered many of these communities, resulting in a complete deterioration in [[quality of life]] and a reversal in rising [[living standards]] for the [[industrial working class]]. Many either dropped in status to the [[working poor]] or fell into permanent reliance on [[welfare dependence]]. Some dropped out altogether and joined the [[black market economy]], while a limited few did manage to ascend to the [[lower middle-class]].

The [[Mosaic (geodemography)|Mosaic 2010]] groups where the proportion of residents in NRS social grade D was rated "high" in the 2010 Mosaic Index are "Residents with sufficient incomes in right-to-buy social housing" and "Families in low-rise social housing with high levels of benefit need".

Fictional stereotypes include: [[Andy Capp]] and [[Albert Steptoe]], who is not only unaspirational himself; but crushes the aspirations of his son Harold.

It has been argued&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isj.org.uk/?id=293|title=The shape of the working class – International Socialism|author=|date=|website=www.isj.org.uk|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that with the decline in manufacturing and increase in the service sector, lower-paid [[office workers]] are effectively working-class. [[Call centre]]s in particular, have sprung up in former centres of industry. However, since the early-2000s; there has been a trend for many call centres to close down in the UK and outsource their jobs to [[India]], as part of cost-cutting measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/our-towns-and-cities/sheffield/new-call-centre-creates-200-jobs-in-sheffield-1-8320022|title=New Call Centre Creates 200 Jobs in Sheffield|publisher=The Star|author=Robert Cumber|date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/business/sheffield-call-centre-set-to-create-150-jobs-1-8198111|title=Sheffield Call Centre Set to Create 150 Jobs|publisher=The Star|date=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Street of terraced housing.jpg|thumb|right|Terraced housing in [[Loughborough]], built for the working classes.]]
During the post-war era, [[White British|White]] working-class Britons witnessed a big rise in their standard of living. As noted by [[Denys Blakeway]]:

"The White working-class have prospered hugely since the war. They have experienced unparalleled growth in disposable income and today they are now richer than their parents and grandparents could ever have imagined.  There are shared values in White working-class culture but I think it is incredibly difficult to put your finger on exactly what it is that defines "White working-class" because a lot of them are shared by the middle-class, such as football and the pub."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7296072.stm | work=BBC News | first=Dan | last=Bell | title=Who are the white working class? | date=14 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Skilled working class====
This class of people would be in skilled [[industry|industrial]] jobs or tradesmen, traditionally in the construction and manufacturing industry, but in recent decades showing entrepreneurial development as the stereotypical [[white van man]], or self-employed contractors.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt; These people would speak in regional accents and have  completed craft [[apprenticeship]]s rather than a [[university education]]. The only Mosaic 2010 group where the proportion of residents in NRS social grade C2 was rated "high" in the 2010 Mosaic Index is "Residents with sufficient incomes in right-to-buy social housing".&lt;ref&gt;Mosaic 2010 grand index&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle class===
[[File:Ashley Walk, Mill Hill - geograph.org.uk - 458447.jpg|thumb|A suburban street in Mill Hill, London, typical of middle-class housing]]
{{see also|Middle England}}

====Lower middle class====
The British lower middle-class primarily consists of [[office worker]]s. In the nineteenth century, the middle and lower middle classes were able to live in suburbs due to the development of horse-drawn omnibuses and railways.&lt;ref name="bl.uk"&gt;https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/suburbia#&lt;/ref&gt; One radical Liberal politician ([[Charles Masterman]]), writing in 1909 used "the Middle Classes" and "the suburbans" synonymously.&lt;ref name="bl.uk"/&gt; In the early twenty-first century, there were no Mosaic 2010 geodemographic groups where the proportion of residents in NRS social grade C1 was rated as "high" or "low" in the 2010 Index; it was rated as "average" in all Mosaic groups,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Mosaic 2010 Grand Index&lt;/ref&gt; whether these were of a suburban, rural, city or small-town nature.

They are typically employed in relatively unskilled service sector jobs (such as in retail sales or [[travel agent]]s), or work in [[local government]] or are factory and other industrial building owners. Prior to the expansion in higher education from the 1960s onwards, members of this class generally did not have a university education.

Members of the lower middle-class typically speak in local accents, although relatively mild. Votes in this area are split and minority parties will have a stronger proportion. The comedy character [[Hyacinth Bucket]] is a satirical stereotype for this social group.

====Middle middle class====
The middle-class in Britain often consists of people with [[tertiary education]] and may have been educated at either [[state school|state]] or [[private school]]s.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;[[Kate Fox]], {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-kDPgxYU-s0C&amp;dq=%27%27Watching+the+English%27%27 |title=Watching the English: The Hidden Rules of English Behaviour |publisher=Nicholas Brealey Pub. |accessdate=4 October 2009 |isbn=9781857884470 |date=2 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical jobs include: [[accountant]]s, [[architect]]s, [[solicitor]]s, [[surveyor]]s, [[social worker]]s, [[teacher]]s, [[manager]]s, specialist IT workers, [[engineer]]s, [[Physician|doctors]], university-educated [[nurse]]s and [[civil servant]]s. Displays of [[conspicuous consumption]] are considered vulgar by them; instead they prefer to channel excess income into investments, especially property.

Members of the middle-class are often politically and socially engaged (a Mori poll in 2005 found 70% of grades AB voted at the [[2005 UK general election|2005 general election]] compared to 54% of grades DE) and might be regular churchgoers (a YouGov poll in 2014 found 62% of those attending church at least once a month were NRS grades ABC1),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brin.ac.uk/2015/demography-of-churchgoing-and-other-news/|title=Demography of Churchgoing and Other News - British Religion in Numbers|date=22 February 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.singularinsight.com/men-practising-christian-worship.html|title=Men practising Christian worship|website=S I N G U L A R &amp;nbsp; I N S I G H T}}&lt;/ref&gt; might sit on local committees and governing boards or stand for political office. Education is greatly valued by the middle-classes: they will make every effort to ensure their children get offered a place at university; they may send their children to a  [[private education|private school]], hire a home tutor for out of school hours so their child learns at a faster rate, or go to great lengths to get their children enrolled into good state or selective grammar schools; such as moving house into the catchment area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23576398-rise-in-families-caught-cheating-for-school-places.do|title=Rise in families caught cheating for school places|author=|date=|website=thisislondon.co.uk|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also value culture and make up a significant proportion of the book-buying and theatre-going public. They typically read [[broadsheet newspaper]]s rather than [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloids]]. Politically, they are disproportionately supporters of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. The only Mosaic 2010 geodemographic type where the proportion of residents in NRS social grade B was rated as "high" in the 2010 index was "People living in brand new residential developments".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  The middle classes particularly of England are often popularly referred to as "[[Middle England]]".&lt;ref name="reeves"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2007/10/middle-england-class-social |first=Richard |last=Reeves |title=Middle England. They're nicer than you think |journal=[[New Statesman]] |date=25 October 2007 |accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comedy character [[The Good Life (1975 TV series)|Margo Leadbetter]] is a satirical stereotype for this group, as is [[Jilly Cooper]]'s Howard Weybridge.&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;[[Jilly Cooper]]{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6lMiAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Class,+A+view+from+Middle+England&amp;dq=Class,+A+view+from+Middle+England |title=Class: a view from middle England |publisher=[[Eyre Methuen]] |accessdate=4 October 2009 |year=1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Upper middle class====
[[File:The Old Schools, Harrow School.JPG|thumb|[[Harrow School]]. The public school is traditionally one of the key institutions of the upper-middle-class in Britain.&lt;ref name="Britain 1950, page 679"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Urban History of Britain: 1840–1950 |location=Cambridge |year=2000 |first1=David Michael |last1=Palliser |first2=Peter |last2=Clark |first3=Martin J. |last3=Daunton |page=679 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The upper middle-class in Britain broadly consists of people who were born into families which have traditionally possessed high incomes, although this group is defined more by family background than by job or income. This stratum, in England, traditionally uses the [[Received Pronunciation]] dialect natively.

The upper middle-class are traditionally educated at [[independent school (United Kingdom)|independent schools]], preferably one of the "major" or "minor" "[[public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/columnists/james-delingpole/7482608/thank-god-i-dont-have-that-ghastly-sense-of-entitlement-that-eton-instils/ |title=Thank God I don’t have that ghastly sense of entitlement that Eton instils |work=[[The Spectator]] |date=17 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/20/clegg-cameron-posher |title=Who's posher: Clegg or Cameron? |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 April 2010 |first=Sholto |last=Byrnes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which themselves often have pedigrees going back for hundreds of years and charge fees of as much as £33,000 per year per pupil (as of 2014).&lt;ref name="Britain 1950, page 679"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9821490/Is-there-a-private-school-prejudice.html |title=Is there a private school prejudice? |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=28 January 2013 |first=Nigel |last=Farndale }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many upper-middle-class families may have previous ancestry that often directly relates to the [[upper class]]es. Although not necessarily of the landowning classes – as a result, perhaps, of lack of a male heir – many families' titles/styles have not been inherited and therefore many families' past status became dissolved.

Although such categorisations are not precise, popular contemporary examples of upper-middle-class people may include [[Boris Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Popham|first1=Peter|title=The best of enemies: David Cameron vs Boris Johnson|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-best-of-enemies-david-cameron-vs-boris-johnson-2335578.html|publisher=Independent 11 August 2011|accessdate=1 May 2015|quote=Toby Young, co-producer of the drama documentary When Boris Met Dave, describes Johnson as lower-upper-middle class – fellow Old Etonian George Orwell's celebrated self-definition...}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Warde|first1=Alan|title=Cultural Consumption, Classification and Power|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CT-PAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=kate+middleton+upper+middle+class#v=onepage&amp;q=kate%20middleton%20upper%20middle%20class&amp;f=false|publisher=Routledge, 18 October 2013 (Page 9)|accessdate=1 May 2014|quote=...Kate Middleton is privately educated (courtesy of paternal family trust funds established decades ago)...and ...is from a wealthy upper-middle-class family...|isbn=9781317982227|date=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Sean|title=Kate -  A Biography of Kate Middleton|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QwIXG7EbQ5cC&amp;pg=PT19&amp;lpg=PT19&amp;dq=kate+middleton+upper-middle-class#v=onepage&amp;q=kate%20middleton%20upper-middle-class&amp;f=false|publisher=Simon and Schuster, 24 May 2011|accessdate=1 May 2016|quote=...family trusts were set up over 100 years ago..."(Middleton's ) family were upper-middle-class observed a family friend"...|isbn=9781451661569|date=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent 20 Mar 2011"&gt;{{cite news|title=Class exclusive: Seven in 10 of us belong to Middle Britain|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/class-exclusive-seven-in-10-of-us-belong-to-middle-britain-2247052.html |work=[[The Independent]] |location=UK |date=20 March 2011 |accessdate=1 May 2016|quote=The next poshest, Kate Middleton, is regarded as upper middle class...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Price|first1=Joann.

===Upper class===
{{Main|Upper class}}
[[File:WoburnAbbey01.JPG|thumb|[[Woburn Abbey]], family seat of the [[Duke of Bedford]]]]
The [[United Kingdom|British]] "upper-class" is statistically very small and consists of the [[peerage]], [[gentry]] and hereditary landowners, among others. Those in possession of a hereditary peerage (but not a life peerage; for example, a [[duke]]dom, a [[marquess]]ate, an [[earl]]dom, a [[viscount]]y, or a [[baron]]y/Scottish [[lord of parliament]]) are typically members of the upper class.

Traditionally, upper-class children were brought up at home by a [[nanny]] for the first few years of their lives, and then home schooled by private [[tutors]]. From the late-nineteenth century, it became increasingly popular for upper-class families to mimic the middle-classes in sending their children to [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]], which had been predominantly founded to serve the educational needs of the middle-class.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}  Nowadays, when children are old enough, they may attend a [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|prep school]] or pre-preparatory school. Moving into [[secondary education]], it is still commonplace for upper-class children to attend a public school, although it is not unheard of for certain families to send their children to [[state school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Sutherland]], ''[[The English Gentleman]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Continuing education goals can vary from family to family; it may, in part, be based on the educational history of the family.  In the past, both the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Navy]] have been the institutions of choice.  Equally, the [[clergy]], as well as [[academia]], particularly within the [[arts]] and [[humanities]] divisions of Britain's oldest and most prestigious [[universities]] ([[Oxbridge]]), have been traditional career paths amongst the [[upper class]] - indeed until 1840 the majority Oxbridge graduates were destined for ordination.&lt;ref name="Knight"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Frances Knight|title=The Nineteenth-Century Church and English Society|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-65711-2|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accent and language and social class==

===Received Pronunciation===
[[Received Pronunciation]], also known as RP or [[BBC]] English, was a term introduced as way of defining ''standard'' English, but the accent has acquired a certain prestige from being associated with the middle (and above) classes in the South East; the wealthiest part of England. Use of RP by people from the "regions" outside the South East can be indicative of a certain educational background, such as public school or elocution lessons.

"The Queen's English" was once a synonym for RP. However, the Queen and some other older members of the aristocracy are now perceived as speaking in a way that is both more old-fashioned and higher class than "general" RP. [[Phonetician]]s call this accent "Conservative Received Pronunciation".  The Queen's pronunciation has, however, also changed over the years. The results of the Harrington &amp; al. study&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, J., Palethorpe, S., &amp; Watson, C. (2000b). Does the Queen speak the Queen’s
English? Nature Vol. 408, 927.&lt;/ref&gt; can be interpreted either as a change, in a range not normally perceptible, in the direction of the mainstream RP of a reference corpus of 1980s newsreaders,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1515/rela-2015-0010|title = Changes in Received Pronunciation: Diachronic Case Studies|journal = Research in Language|volume = 13|pages = 21–37|year = 2015|last1 = Hinton|first1 = Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; or showing showing subtle changes that might well have been influenced by the vowels of [[Estuary English]].&lt;ref name="DT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/the_queens_diamond_jubilee/9280753/The-Queens-English-changes-through-the-years.html|title=The Queen's English: changes through the years|first=Susie|last=Dent|date=21 May 2012|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BBC English was also a synonym for RP; people seeking a career in acting or broadcasting once learnt RP as a matter of course if they did not speak it already.  However, the BBC and other broadcasters are now much more willing to use – indeed desire to use – regional accents.&lt;ref name="DT" /&gt;

Language and writing style have consistently been one of the most reliable indicators of class, although pronunciation did not become such an indicator until the late-nineteenth century. The variations between the language employed by the upper classes and non-upper classes has, perhaps, been best documented by linguistic Professor [[Alan S C Ross|Alan Ross's]] 1954 article on [[U and non-U English]] usage, with "U" representing upper and upper middle class vocabulary of the time, and "Non-U" representing lower middle class vocabulary. The discussion was furthered in ''[[Noblesse Oblige (book)|Noblesse Oblige]]'' and featured contributions from, among others, [[Nancy Mitford]]. The debate was revisited in the mid-1970s, in a publication by Debrett's called ''U and Non-U Revisited''. Ross also contributed to this volume, and it is remarkable to notice how little the language (amongst other factors) changed in the passing of a quarter of a century.

===English regional dialect===
{{main|Regional accents of English}}

In England, the upper class or prestige dialect is almost always a form of RP; however, some areas have their
"own" prestige dialect, distinct from both RP and the working-class dialect of the region.

England has a wide variety of regional dialects for a small country, most of which have working-class or lower middle-class connotations:
*[[Yorkshire dialect]] the accent of Yorkshire with some considerable variation between the north, south, east and west of the region.
*[[Manchester dialect]] the accent and dialect of [[Manchester]] and the surrounding area. 
*[[Scouse]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; The accent and dialect of Liverpool, especially strong in Merseyside's working-class population.
*[[Brummie]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; The accent and dialect of Birmingham.
*[[Potteries dialect]] the accent and dialect of [[Stoke-on-Trent]] and surround Potteries area.
*The [[Black Country dialect]] of the West Midlands, which is similar to but distinctive from Brummie.
*[[Geordie]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; An accent and dialect of North-East England, particularly the Tyneside area.
* [[Mackem]] – An accent and dialect of Sunderland and surrounding areas.
*[[West Country dialects]] - a variety of similar, yet noticeably different accents and dialects in the South West of England, such as the [[Bristolian dialect]]
*[[Cockney]] is traditionally the working-class accent of [[East London]]. It also has distinct variations in grammar and vocabulary.
*The [[London accent]] is a more broadly defined working and lower middle-class accent than Cockney.
*[[Estuary English]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; A working-class and lower middle-class accent from South-East England, basically a milder (closer to R.P.)  form of the London accent,  showing a tendency to supplant received pronunciation.
*[[Mockney]] is a term used in popular media for a deliberate affectation of the working-class London (Cockney) accent by middle-class people to gain "[[street credibility]]". However, phoneticians regard the infusion of Estuary features into received pronunciation among younger speakers to be a natural process.
* [[Multicultural London English]] (abbreviated MLE), colloquially called [[Jafaican]], is a [[dialect]] (and/or [[sociolect]]) of [[English language|English]] that emerged in the late-twentieth century, and is used mainly by young, [[inner-city]], [[working-class]] people in inner London. It is said to contain many elements from the languages of the [[Caribbean]] ([[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad &amp; Tobago]]), [[South Asia]] ([[Indian subcontinent]]), and [[West Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The English slanguage|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|author=Paul Kerswill|date=3 July 2010|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/3039887/The-English-slanguage.html|accessdate=5 April 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ES"&gt;{{cite web|title=Word on the street in London|author=Harry Mount|date=1 July 2010|work=[[Evening Standard]]|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/article-23851474-word-on-the-street-in-london.do|accessdate=5 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915161805/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/article-23851474-word-on-the-street-in-london.do|archivedate=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as remnants of traditional Cockney.&lt;ref name="ES"/&gt; Although the street name, "Jafaican", may seem imply that it is "fake" [[Jamaican English|Jamaican]], research indicates it is "likely that young people have been growing up in London exposed to a mixture of second-language English and local London English and that this new variety has emerged from that mix",&lt;ref name=dailymail&gt;{{cite news |first=Laura |last=Clark |title='Jafaican' is wiping out inner-city English accents |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=382734&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;in_a_source |date=12 April 2006 |accessdate=2 February 2008 |location=London |work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; the etymology being the "af" and "can" from "African".

==Heraldry and social class==
{{Main|Heraldry}}
[[File:Coat of Arms of Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon.svg|thumb|right|[[Canting arms]] of [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]].]]
An English citizen with arms registered in the [[College of Arms]], or a Scottish citizen in the [[Lyon Court]], can be referred to as [[armiger]]ous.  Any British citizen can apply for arms from their respective authority but only those of sufficient social standing would be granted arms.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}  Arms in and of themselves are imperfectly aligned with social status, in that many of high status will have no right to arms whilst, on the other hand, those entitled to arms by descent can include branches of families from anywhere on the social scale.

Nevertheless, a right to bear arms under the [[Law of Arms]] is, by definition, linked either to the personal acquisition of social status, inspiring application for a personal grant of arms, or to descent from a person who did so in the past. Rightly or wrongly, therefore, the use of a coat of arms is linked to social prestige.

In the early twentieth century, it was argued by heraldic writers such as [[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]] that only those with a right to a coat of arms could correctly be described (if men) as gentlemen and of noble status; however, even at the time this argument was controversial, and it was rejected by other writers such as [[Oswald Barron]] and [[Horace Round]]. In the [[Order of Malta]], where proof of technical nobility is a requirement of certain grades of membership, British members must still base their proof upon an ancestral right to a coat of arms.

==Criticisms==

In 1941, George Orwell wrote that Britain was “the most class-ridden society under the sun.”
&lt;ref&gt;The Future of Socialism by Anthony Crosland&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in 1975 [[Helmut Schmidt]], the then [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor]] of [[West Germany]] stated that:

{{Quote|If one asks oneself what are the true reasons for the differentiated development of societies and economies between the British and most ones on the Continent, I think it has something to do with the fact that British society, much more than the Scandinavian, German, Austrian, and Dutch societies, is characterised by a class-struggle type of society. This is true for both sides of the upper class as well as for the working classes. I think that the way in which organised Labour on the one hand and industrial management on the other had dealt with their problems is outmoded.}}

Later in the same interview, Schmidt noted that&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | title = Foe into friend: The Makers of the New Germany from Konrad Adenauer to Helmut Schmidt
 | first =Marion | last = Dönhoff
}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|You have to treat workers as equal members of society. You have to give them the self–esteem which they can only have if they acquire responsibility. Then you will be able to ask the trade unions to behave and to abstain from those idiotic policies. Then they will accept some guidance from outsiders—from the government or the party or whatever it is. But as long as you maintain the damned class-ridden society of yours you will never get out of your mess.}}

In [[metaphysics]], a '''universal''' is what particular things have in common, namely characteristics or qualities. In other words, universals are repeatable or recurrent entities that can be instantiated or exemplified by many particular things.&lt;ref&gt;Price (1953); Loux (1998), p 20.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, suppose there are two chairs in a room, each of which is green. These two chairs both share the quality of "[[wikt:chairness|chairness]]", as well as greenness or the quality of being green; in other words, they share a "universal". There are three major kinds of qualities or characteristics: [[type (metaphysics)|types or kinds]] (e.g. mammal), [[property (metaphysics)|properties]] (e.g. short, strong), and [[relation (metaphysics)|relations]] (e.g. father of, next to). These are all different types of universals.&lt;ref&gt;Loux (2001), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradigmatically, universals are ''[[abstract (philosophy)|abstract]]'' (e.g. humanity), whereas [[particular]]s are ''[[concrete (philosophy)|concrete]]'' (e.g. the personhood of Socrates). However, universals are not necessarily abstract and particulars are not necessarily concrete.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez-Pereyra (2008), §1.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one might hold that numbers are [[abstract particular|particular yet abstract objects]].  Likewise, some philosophers, such as [[David Malet Armstrong|D. M. Armstrong]], consider universals to be concrete.

Most do not consider [[class (philosophy)|classes]] to be universals, although some prominent philosophers do, such as John Bigelow.

==Problem of universals==
{{Main|Problem of universals}}
''The [[problem of universals]]'' is an ancient problem in metaphysics about whether universals exist. The problem arises from attempts to account for the phenomenon of similarity or attribute agreement among things.&lt;ref&gt;Loux (1998), p. 20; (2001), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[grass]] and [[Granny Smith|Granny Smith apples]] are similar or agree in attribute, namely in having the attribute of greenness. The issue is how to account for this sort of agreement in attribute among things.

There are many philosophical positions regarding universals. Taking "beauty" as an example, three positions are:
* [[Idealism]] or [[conceptualism]]: beauty is a property constructed in the mind, so it exists only in descriptions of things.
* Platonic realism: beauty is a property that exists in an ideal form independently of any mind or thing.
* Aristotelian realism: beauty is a property that only exists when beautiful things exist.

Taking a broader view, the main positions are generally considered classifiable as: [[Philosophical realism|realism]], [[nominalism]], and [[idealism]] (sometimes simply named "anti-realism" with regard to universals).&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein (2006), §3.&lt;/ref&gt; Realists posit the existence of independent, abstract universals to account for attribute agreement. Nominalists deny that universals exist, claiming that they are not necessary to explain attribute agreement. Conceptualists posit that universals exist only in the [[philosophy of mind|mind]], or when conceptualized, denying the independent existence of universals. Complications which arise include the implications of language use and the complexity of relating language to [[ontology]].

==Particular==
{{Main|Particular}}
A universal may have instances, known as its ''particulars''. For example, the type ''dog'' (or ''doghood'') is a universal, as are the property ''red'' (or ''redness'') and the relation ''betweenness'' (or ''being between''). Any particular dog, red thing, or object that is between other things is not a universal, however, but is an ''instance'' of a universal. That is, a universal type (''doghood''), property (''redness''), or relation (''betweenness'') ''[[Substance theory#Inherence|inheres]]'' in a particular object (a specific dog, red thing, or object between other things).

==Platonic realism==
[[Platonic realism]] holds universals to be the [[referent]]s of general terms, such as the ''[[abstraction|abstract]]'', nonphysical, non-mental entities to which words such as "sameness", "circularity", and "beauty" refer. Particulars are the referents of proper names, such as "Phaedo," or of definite descriptions that identify single objects, such as the phrase, "that bed over there". Other metaphysical theories may use the terminology of universals to describe physical entities.

Plato's examples of what we might today call universals included mathematical and geometrical ideas such as a circle and natural numbers as universals.  Plato's views on universals did, however, vary across several different discussions. In some cases, Plato spoke as if the perfect circle functioned as the [[substantial form|form]] or blueprint for all copies and for the word definition of ''circle''. In other discussions, Plato describes particulars as "participating" in the associated universal.

Contemporary realists agree with the thesis that universals are multiply-exemplifiable entities. Examples include by D. M. Armstrong, Nicholas Wolterstorff, Reinhardt Grossmann, Michael Loux.

==Nominalism==
Nominalists hold that universals are not real mind-independent entities but either merely concepts (sometimes called "conceptualism") or merely names. Nominalists typically argue that properties are abstract particulars (like tropes) rather than universals. [[JP Moreland]] distinguishes between "extreme" and "moderate" nominalism.&lt;ref&gt;Moreland (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of nominalists include the medieval philosophers [[Roscelin of Compiègne]] and [[William of Ockham]] and contemporary philosophers [[W. V. O. Quine]], [[Wilfred Sellars]], [[D. C. Williams]], and [[Keith Campbell (philosopher)|Keith Campbell]].

==Ness-ity-hood principle &lt;!--'Ness-ity-hood principle' and 'Ness-ity-hood Principle' redirect here--&gt;==
The '''ness-ity-hood principle'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is used mainly by English-speaking philosophers to generate convenient, concise names for universals or [[Property (philosophy)|properties]].&lt;ref&gt;Feldman (2005), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Ness-Ity-Hood Principle, a name for any universal may be formed that is distinctive, "of left-handers" may be formed by taking the predicate "left-handed" and adding "ness", which yields the name "left-handedness".  The principle is most helpful in cases where there is not an established or standard name of the universal in ordinary English usage:  What is the name of the universal distinctive of chairs?  "Chair" in English is used not only as a subject (as in "The chair is broken"), but also as a predicate (as in "That is a chair").  So to generate a name for the universal distinctive of chairs, take the predicate "chair" and add "ness", which yields "chairness".

[[File:Federico zuccari, porta virtutis, 1585 circa (urbino, gn delle marche) 07 invidia.jpg|thumb|Allegorical representation of the Vice of [[Envy]], by [[Federico Zuccari]]]]
'''Vice''' is a practice, behaviour, or [[Habit (psychology)|habit]] generally considered [[Morality|immoral]], [[sin]]ful, [[crime|criminal]], [[rude]], [[taboo]], depraved, or degrading in the associated society. In more minor usage, vice can refer to a fault, a negative character trait, a defect, an infirmity, or a bad or unhealthy habit (such as an [[addiction to smoking]]). Vices are usually associated with a transgression in a person's character or temperament rather than their morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0000.010,|title='Jaucourt, Louis, chevalier de.

The opposite of vice is [[virtue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesaurus.com/browse/vice|title=Vice|publisher=Thesaurus.com|accessdate=2012-06-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524010228/http://thesaurus.com/browse/vice|archivedate=2012-05-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The modern English term that best captures its original meaning is the word ''vicious'', which means "full of vice". In this sense, the word ''vice'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#vitium|vitium]]'', meaning "failing or defect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=vice+&amp;searchmode=none|title=Vice|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2012-06-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129114109/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=vice+&amp;searchmode=none|archivedate=2014-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(This meaning is completely separate from the word ''vice'' when used as an official title to indicate a [[wikt:deputy|deputy]], substitute or subordinate, as in [[vice president]], vice-chancellor or [[viceroy]]. The etymology of this usage derives from the Latin prefix ''vice-'', meaning "in the place of".)

== Law enforcement ==
Depending on the country or jurisdiction, vice crimes may or may not be treated as a separate category in the criminal codes. Even in jurisdictions where vice is not explicitly delineated in the legal code, the term ''vice'' is often used in law enforcement and judicial systems as an umbrella for crimes involving activities that are considered inherently immoral, regardless of the legality or objective harm involved.

In the United Kingdom, the term ''vice'' is commonly used in law and law enforcement to refer to criminal offences related to [[prostitution]] and pornography.&lt;ref name="police"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.met.police.uk/co/clubs_and_vice/index.htm|title=Metropolitan Police Service - Please Wait...|publisher=met.police.uk|accessdate=2014-09-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511230918/http://www.met.police.uk/co/clubs_and_vice/index.htm|archivedate=2013-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the term is also used to refer to [[drug prohibition law|crimes related to drugs]], alcohol, and gambling.&lt;ref name="Hess 2008 p. 209"&gt;Hess (2008), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vice squad===
[[File:Vice squad interrogation in Calumet City 1912 ichicdn n059451.jpg|thumb|A 1912 portrait of Frankie Fore, sitting in a room during a vice raid in [[Calumet City, Illinois|Calumet City]] (formerly known as West Hammond), Illinois.]]

{{redirect|Vice squad}}
A vice squad, also called a vice unit or a morality squad, is (though not always) a police division, whose focus is to restrain or suppress moral crimes. Though what is considered or accepted as a ''moral'' crime by society often varies considerably according to local laws or customs between nations, countries, or states, it often includes activities such as [[gambling]], [[narcotics]], [[pornography]], and [[alcohol law|illegal sales of alcoholic beverages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/vice+squad|title=Vice squad|publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-31|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050921013607/http://www.thefreedictionary.com/vice%20squad|archivedate=2005-09-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vice squads do not concentrate on crimes like [[fraud]] and murder.

== Religion ==
[[Religious police]], for example [[islamic religious police]] units or [[sharia]] police in certain parts of the [[Arab world|Arab-speaking world]], are morality squads that also monitors for example [[Islam and clothing|dress codes]], observance of store-closures during prayer time, [[Islamic dietary laws|consumption of unlawful beverages or foods]], [[zina|unrelated males and females socializing]], and homosexual behavior.

=== Buddhism ===
{{see also|Buddhist views on sin}}
In the [[Sarvastivadin]] tradition of [[Buddhism]], there are 108 defilements, or vices, which are prohibited. These are subdivided into 10 bonds and 98 proclivities.&lt;ref name="Hirasawa 1998 p. 202"&gt;Hirakawa (1998), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; The 10 bonds are the following:&lt;ref name="Hirasawa 1998 p. 202" /&gt;
* Absence of [[shame]]
* Absence of [[embarrassment]]
* Jealousy
* [[:wikt:parsimony|Parsimony]] (in the sense of stinginess)
* Remorse
* Drowsiness
* Distraction
* [[Sloth (deadly sin)|Torpor]]
* Anger
* Concealment of wrongdoing

=== Christianity ===
{{main|Christian ethics}}
[[File:Stiftskirche Niederhaslach Glasfenster (Kampf der Tugenden mit dem Laster).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Virtue]]s fighting vices, stained glass window (14th century) in the [[Niederhaslach Church]]]]

Christians believe there are two kinds of vice:{{Citation needed|reason=Can it be stated that these distinctions truly apply broadly across the entire Christian world?|date=April 2010}}
* Vices that come from the physical organism as instincts, which can become perverse (such as lust)
* Vices that come from false idolatry in the spiritual realm

The first kind of vice, though sinful, is believed less serious than the second. Vices recognized as spiritual by Christians include [[blasphemy]] ([[Sacred|holiness]] betrayed), [[apostasy]] ([[faith]] betrayed), despair ([[hope]] betrayed), [[hatred]] ([[Love (religious views)|love]] betrayed), and indifference (scripturally, a "hardened heart"). Christian theologians have reasoned that the most destructive vice equates to a certain type of [[pride]] or the complete idolatry of the self. It is argued that through this vice, which is essentially competitive, all the worst evils come into being. In Christian theology, it originally led to the [[Fall of Man]], and, as a purely diabolical spiritual vice, it outweighs anything else often condemned by the Church.

==== Roman Catholicism ====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Lust]] --&gt;
The [[Roman Catholic|Roman Catholic Church]] distinguishes between vice, which is a habit of sin, and the sin itself, which is an individual morally wrong act. Note that in Roman Catholicism, the word "sin" also refers to the state that befalls one upon committing a morally wrong act. In this section, the word always means the sinful act. It is the sin, and not the vice, that deprives one of God's [[sanctifying grace]] and renders one deserving of God's [[Hell in Christian beliefs#hell in Rom Cath|punishment]]. [[Thomas Aquinas]] taught that "absolutely speaking, the sin surpasses the vice in wickedness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm Entry for ''vice''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405184628/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm |date=2007-04-05 }} at NewAdvent.org online Catholic Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, even after a person's sins have been [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|forgiven]], the underlying habit (the vice) may remain. Just as vice was created in the first place by repeatedly yielding to the temptation to sin, so vice may be removed only by repeatedly resisting temptation and performing virtuous acts; the more entrenched the vice, the more time and effort needed to remove it. Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]] says that following rehabilitation and the acquisition of virtues, the vice does not persist as a habit, but rather as a mere disposition, and one that is in the process of being eliminated. Medieval illuminated manuscripts circulated with colorful schemas for developing proper attitudes, with scriptural allusions modelled on nature: the [[tree of virtues]] as blossoming flowers or vices bearing sterile fruit, The Renaissance writer [[Pietro Bembo]] is credited with reaffirming and promoting the Christian perfection of classical humanism. Deriving all from love (or the lack thereof) his&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italnet.nd.edu/Dante/images/tp1515/1515.wc3.150dpi.jpeg Flow diagram leading to the deeper-seated vices in purgatory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505235431/http://www.italnet.nd.edu/Dante/images/tp1515/1515.wc3.150dpi.jpeg |date=2012-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; schemas were added as supplements&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italnet.nd.edu/Dante/text/1515.venice.html Aldus' second edition printing of Dante's Divine Comedy, Venice 1502.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205212641/http://www.italnet.nd.edu/Dante/text/1515.venice.html |date=2012-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the newly invented technology of printing by [[Aldus Manutius]] in his editions of Dante's Divine Comedy dating from early in the 16th century.

=== Dante's seven deadly vices ===
The poet [[Dante Alighieri]] listed the following [[Seven deadly sins|seven deadly vices]], associating them structurally&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wolfram.demon.co.uk/purgatory4.gif |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205191100/http://www.wolfram.demon.co.uk/purgatory4.gif |archivedate=2012-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as flaws in the soul's inherent capacity for goodness as made in the Divine Image yet perverted by the Fall:

#[[Hubris|Pride]] or [[vanity]]: an excessive love of the self (holding the self outside of its proper position regarding God or fellows; Dante's definition was "love of self perverted to hatred and contempt for one's neighbour"). In the Latin lists of the [[Seven Deadly Sins]], pride is referred to as ''superbia''.
#[[Envy]] or [[jealousy]]: resentment of others for their possessions (Dante: "love of one's own good perverted to a desire to deprive other men of theirs"). In the Latin lists of the Seven Deadly Sins, envy is referred to as ''invidia''.
#[[Wrath]] or [[anger]]: feelings of hatred, revenge or denial, as well as punitive desires outside of justice (Dante's description was "love of justice perverted to revenge and spite"). In the Latin lists of the Seven Deadly Sins, wrath is referred to as ''ira'', which primitive vices tempt astray by increasingly '''perverting''' the proper purpose of charity, directing it inwards, leading to a disorded navel-gazing preoccupation with personal goods in isolation absent proper harmonious relations leading to violent disruption of balance with others.
#[[Sloth (deadly sin)|Sloth]] or [[laziness]]: idleness and wastefulness of time or other allotted resources. Laziness is condemned because it results in others having to work harder; also, useful work will not be done. Sloth is referred to in Latin as ''accidie'' or ''acedia'', which vice tempts a self-aware soul to be too easily satisfied, '''thwarting''' charity's purpose as insufficiently perceptible within the soul itself or abjectly indifferent in relationship with the needs of others and their satisfaction, an escalation in evil, more odious than the passion of hate
#[[Seven deadly sins#Greed|Avarice]] (covetousness, greed): a desire to possess more than one has need or use for (or according to Dante, "excessive love of money and power"). In the Latin lists of the Seven Deadly Sins, avarice is referred to as ''avaritia''.
#[[Gluttony]]:  overindulgence in food, drink or intoxicants, or misplaced desire of food as a pleasure for its sensuality ("excessive love of pleasure" was Dante's rendering). In the Latin lists of the Seven Deadly Sins, gluttony is referred to as ''gula''.
#[[Lust]]: excessive sexual desire. Dante's criterion was that "lust detracts from true love". In the Latin lists of the Seven Deadly Sins, lust is referred to as ''luxuria'', which vices tempt cultivated souls in their ability to direct charity's proper purpose to good things or actions, by '''indulging excess'''. Thus in Dante's estimation the soul's detachment from sensual appetites become the vices most difficult to tame, urges not as easily curbed by mere good manners since inflamed via appropriate use rather than inappropriate misuse. Hence conventional respect for the ninth and tenth commandments against coveting and social customs that encourage custody of the eyes and ears become prudent adjuncts to training against vice.
The first three terraces of purgatory expiate the sins which can be considered to arise from love perverted, that is, sins which arise from the heart of the sinner being set upon something which is wrong in the eyes of God. Those being purged here must have their love set upon the right path. The fourth terrace of purgatory expiates the sins which can be considered to arise from love defective, that is, love which, although directed towards the correct subjects is too weak to drive the sinner to act as they should. Those being purged here must have their love strengthened so as to drive them correctly. The fifth, sixth, and seventh terraces of purgatory expiate the sins which can be considered to arise from love excessive, that is, love which although directed towards ends which God considers good is directed towards them too much for the sinner to gain bliss from them, and also so that the sinner is distracted from the love of other things of which God approves. Their love must be cooled to a more sensible level.

{{Discrimination sidebar}}
Both adults and children who have some form of [[disability]] will experience acts of [[violence]] against them more often than those without disabilities. Children with disabilities are 3.7 times more likely to be affected by any sort of violence, 3.6 times more likely to be victims of physical violence, 2.9 times more likely to be victims of [[sexual violence]], and children with [[intellectual impairment]] are among the most vulnerable being 4.6 times more likely to experience sexual violence than their non-disabled peers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/disabilities/violence/en/|title=Violence against adults and children with disabilities|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published by the [[World Health Organization]] titled ''Prevalence and risk of violence against adults with disabilities: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies'' revealed that adults with any form of disability are 1.5 times more likely to experience some form of violence while adults with some form of mental impairment are 4 times more likely to experience violence than those without disabilities. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/disabilities/publications/violence_children_lancet.pdf?ua=1|title=Prevalence and risk of violence against adults with disabilities: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison Groups ==
As mentioned by Powers and Oschwald,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Powers|first1=Laurie|last2=Oschwald|first2=Mary|date=|title=Violence and abuse against people with disabilities: Experiences, barriers and prevention strategies.|url=http://nasuad.org/sites/nasuad/files/hcbs/files/53/2622/AbuseandViolenceBrief.pdf|publisher=[[Oregon Health &amp; Science University]] Center on Self-Determination}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are seven categories of abusive behavior defined by both male and female individuals who have some form of disability: physical abuse, sexual abuse, verbal or emotional abuse, neglect or withholding support, financial abuse, manipulation of medications, and destroying or disabling equipment. With the scope of abuse being clearly defined, we can begin building evidence and empirical data from the individual experiences to find and implement solutions where they are most effective.

=== Institutional vs. non-institutional ===
When comparing and contrasting Institutional and Non-Institutional cases of violence against people with disabilities, we find that 82% of violence against people who are disabled happens when they are Institutionalized. Common thought is that Institutions "inherently promote abuse and dehumanization."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cdrnys.org/blog/advocacy/the-unacknowledged-crisis-of-violence-against-disabled-people/|title=The Unacknowledged Crisis of Violence Against Disabled People|last=Morgan|first=Cameron|publisher=Center for Disability Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, Institutionalized cases are far more present than Non-Institutionalized cases, statistics show that sexual assault based violence is 7 times more probable among intellectually disabled people and that number jumps to 12 times more probable if that person is a woman compared to a non-disabled peer.

=== Disability type vs. age ===
Age plays a major factor when looking into non-institutionalized violence. Those who have some form of disability ranging from the ages of 12 to 15 experience violence at a rate of 144.1 out of 1000 persons compared to their non-disabled peers at a rate of 38.8 out of a thousand with a rate difference being 105.3.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/capd0915st.pdf|title=Crime Against Persons with Disabilities, 2009-2015 - Statistical Tables|last=Harrel|first=Erika|date=July 2017|publisher=

=== Disability type vs. gender ===
Examining statistics from ''Crime Against Persons with Disabilities''{{cn|date=December 2018}} table 5,{{clarify|the table must be here, you are not allowed to force readers to look elsewhere to make sense of this article|date=November 2018}} results highlight that females between the ages of 12 and higher experience slightly higher percentages of violence among the disabled community compared to males of the same age group except for ambulatory disabilities. The rate of violence committed against men with a cognitive disability is 55.4 while females are at 60.3 out of 1000.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ambulatory disability being the only category where men have a higher rate comes to 29.6 while females are at 29.3 with a difference of 0.3.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Visual impairment has a significant affect on the outcome of violence between the sexes as men are at a rate of 24.6 while females are 32.3 out of 1000 concluding a difference of 7.7.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lastly, table 8{{clarify|the table must be here, you are not allowed to force readers to look elsewhere to make sense of this article|date=November 2018}} displays a slight difference of 1.8 between the sexes with males at 15 while females are at 16.8.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Victim-offender relationship vs. disability status ===

Referencing ''Crime Against Persons with Disabilities''{{cn|date=December 2018}} table 8,{{clarify|the table must be here, you are not allowed to force readers to look elsewhere to make sense of this article|date=November 2018}} it is evident{{says who|date=November 2018}} that persons with disabilities are at risk of a higher rate of violence committed against them than their non-disabled peers. Additionally, according to the data, individuals who have some form of disability are at a higher risk of being victimized by a well-known or casual acquaintance over a complete stranger unlike their non-disabled peers; people whom have experienced an act of violence by a stranger with a disability being at 30.3% while non-disabled people are at 39.4% by a complete stranger.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Historically, gangs surfaced in the United States as early as the 1820s, mainly in New York.  Gang activity was still considered criminal, however, when drugs were made illegal in 1912 with the [[International Opium Convention]], gang activity and drug trafficking increased. The United States saw a major increase in gangs during the 1970s and 1980s, due to population growth and the demand for drugs. In 1991, it was estimated that there were 774,000 active gang members in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Musto|first=David F.|title=Opium, Cocaine and Marijuana in American History|journal=Scientific American |year=1991|volume=265|issue=1| pages=40–47|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0791-40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Federal level ==

Although many gang enforcement and policing tactics are carried out on a state-by-state basis, there are federal programs that aim to address the War on Gangs. National agencies, like the [[FBI]], [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE), [[United States Marshals Service]] and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives]], have enacted programs that target gangs and gang related activities at the federal level.

At the federal level, the “[[Gangbusters Bill]]” of 2005, authorized increased federal spending to support federal, state and local law enforcement efforts against gang violence and shared intelligence and joint investigation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Papachristos|first=Andrew|title=Interpreting Inkblots: Deciphering and Doing Something about Modern Street Gangs Gangs &amp; Gang-Related Crime: Reaction Essay|journal=Criminology and Public Policy|year=2005|volume=4|issue=3|pages=643–652|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9133.2005.00301.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== State level ==
The criminalization of those associated with such terminology falls solely upon the state magistrate, while the policing involves a cohesive effort by local, state, and federal authorities. The policing tactics implemented and aimed to disrupt, deter, and eliminate criminal street gang activity naturally varies from city to city and state to state depending on the size of the problem as well as legislation.  However, the advancement of [[counterinsurgency]] technologies and strategies proven effective in militarized zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan has provided authorities with new ways to fight the “war on gangs” in America.  Statistical analysis in conjunction with advanced [[military software]] can now provide lawmaking authorities with the type of information that maps connections between gang activities, individual suspects, their [[social circle]]s, family ties, and neighborhood connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Symons|first=Glady L.|title=Racialization of the Street Gang Issue in Montreal: a police perspective|journal=Canadian Ethnic Studies|year=1999|volume=3|issue=1|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Authorities now have the tools to deconstruct the culture of ‘criminal street gangs’ by not only identifying their territorial boundaries but criminal industries, politics affiliates both in and out of the penitentiary, [[gang code]] and ethics, as well as illegal activities.

Beyond the push for a national model providing a tactical framework outlining the methodologies behind the [[policing strategies]] of: prevention, intervention, intelligence, and suppression of criminal street gang activity, there is yet another arena where the “War on Gangs” continues to be fought, the political arena.  Organized criminal street gangs such as 18th Street are boasting over 65,000 members and are believed to be operating in over 120 U.S. cities, 37 states, in addition to being considered an international crime organization linked to corrupt political insurgency. The [[Gangster Disciples]] is an organization with over 30,000 members in 35 states, employing themselves not only in drug trade but sponsoring political candidates, infiltrating police and private security agencies, and sponsoring protest marches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=M. L.|title=Maybe We Shouldn't Study "Gangs": Does Reification Obscure Youth Violence?|journal=Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice|volume=21|issue=2|pages=170–190|doi=10.1177/1043986204272912|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Local and community level ==
Researchers have attempted to understand the theoretical implications for participation in gang activity. Many of them looked into the reasons why people join gangs. The most common reasons examined among gang researchers include factors such as socioeconomic status, peer-to-peer and parent-to-child relationships, and discrimination. For example, in 2007, California State University-Northridge professor [[Kay Kei-Ho Pih]] and three other university professors conducted a study examining the purpose of capital (drug trafficking) among Latino and Taiwanese gangs. Their findings showed that the Latino gang members were raised in poor neighborhoods, wanted to make quick and easy money from selling drugs, and did not receive support from their parents about their academic endeavors which led them to drop out of school or complete a [[GED]]. The Taiwanese triad members, on the other hand, came from higher socioeconomic statuses, prioritized their education getting undergrad and graduate degrees, and sold drugs for recreation purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pih|first=Kay Kei-Ho|title=Different Strokes for Different Gangs: An Analysis of Capital Among Latino and Asian Gang Members|journal=Sociological Perspectives|year=2008|pages=473–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hua-Lun Huang argues that gangs such as the Chinese [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]]s and the [[Mexican Mafia]] could also form because of extremist ideology and political connections to government outside of the United States. In 2002, the [[Routine activity theory]] was used by California State University, Long Beach criminal justice professor, John Z. Wang in his case study about eight bank robberies in Houston, Texas, which states that crimes committed by gangs are influenced by three factors: 
*Motivated offenders
*The availability of suitable targets
*The absence of capable guardians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=J|title=Bank Robberies by an Asian Gang: An Assessment of the Routine Activities Theory|journal=International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology|volume=46|issue=5|year=2002|pages=555–68|doi=10.1177/030662402236740|pmid=12365143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative approaches===
Several scholars suggest that alternative methods should be implemented in order to fight against the war on gangs including the development of community-based outreach programs instead of continuing to arrest potential gang members. For example, in 1998, [[Westminster Police Department]] director Douglas Kent and Claremont University professor, [[George Felkenes]] conducted a cross-sectional study on the cultural reasons why Vietnamese youth in Southern California join and participate in gang activity by interviewing over 250 Vietnamese youth and parents. Felkenes and Kent concluded their study with recommendations on how to initiate gang prevention programs: 
*They are necessary and should be carefully planned.
*They must focus on minority youth rather than the general public.
*They should make the youth population view gangs in a negative light.
*They should teach them how to cope with gangs in residential areas by avoiding their influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kent|first=D.R.|author2=Felkenes, G.T. |title=Cultural Explanations for Vietnamese Youth Involvement in Street Gangs|journal=US Department of Justic|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign criminologist, Jun Sung Hong in his 2010 study about the [[Bronfenbrenner]] ecological approach to understanding Vietnamese gangs in America states that “after-school programs and activities for youths, such as sports or job training opportunities might enhance pro-social behavior and reduce motivation to join a gang.” He also argues that professional organizations and practitioners should also educate government officials about the correlation between social conditions and the negative outcomes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hong|first=Jun Sung|title=Understanding Vietnamese Youth Gangs in America: An Ecological Systems Analysis|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|year=2010|pages=253–60|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2010.01.003|volume=15|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
