==Overview==
''Algorithms of Oppression'' is a text based on over six years of academic research on Google search algorithms. Noble argues that though algorithms themselves may not be racist, they can [[Algorithmic bias|reflect the biases]] and values of the people who create them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/02/06/scholar-sets-twitter-furor-critiquing-book-he-hasnt-read|title=Scholar sets off Twitter furor by critiquing a book he hasn't read|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/algorithms-of-oppression-racist/|title=Can an algorithm be racist?

==Critical reception==
Critical reception for ''Algorithms of Oppression'' has been largely positive. In the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]'', Emily Drabinski writes, "What emerges from these pages is the sense that Google’s algorithms of oppression comprise just one of the hidden infrastructures that govern our daily lives, and that the others are likely just as hard-coded with white supremacy and misogyny as the one that Noble explores."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/ideologies-of-boring-things-the-internet-and-infrastructures-of-race/#!|title=Ideologies of Boring Things: The Internet and Infrastructures of Race - Los Angeles Review of Books|work=Los Angeles Review of Books|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[PopMatters]],'' Hans Rollman describes writes that ''Algorithms of Oppression'' "demonstrate[s] that search engines, and in particular [[Google]], are not simply imperfect machines, but systems designed by humans in ways that replicate the power structures of the western countries where they are built, complete with all the sexism and racism that are built into those structures."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In ''[[Booklist]],'' reviewer Lesley Williams states, "Noble’s study should prompt some soul-searching about our reliance on commercial search engines and about digital social equity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.booklistonline.com/Algorithms-of-Oppression-How-Search-Engines-Reinforce-Racism-Safiya-Umoja-Noble/pid=9240185|title=Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism, by Safiya Umoja  Noble {{!}} Booklist Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early February 2018, ''Algorithms of Oppression'' received press attention when the official [[Twitter]] account for the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] expressed criticism of the book, citing that the thesis of the text, based on the text of the book's official blurb on commercial sites, could not be reproduced. IEEE's outreach historian, Alexander Magoun, later revealed that he had not read the book, and issued an apology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Baltic 21''' is a plan to cooperate on implementing regional sustainable development. It is managed by the [[Council of the Baltic Sea States]] (CBSS).{{r|hist}}

The mission of Baltic 21 is to contribute towards advancing sustainable development in the Baltic Sea Region by coordinating goals and activities, and by serving as a forum for cooperation across borders and between stakeholder groups.

==History==
Initiated by the [[Prime Minister]]s of the [[Baltic Sea]] countries in 1996, '''Baltic 21''' is a regional expression of the global [[Agenda 21]] adopted by the [[United Nations]] “[[Earth Summit]].”&lt;ref name=hist&gt;http://www.cbss.org/sustainable-prosperous-region/egsd-baltic-2030-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, the CBSS updated the plan in accordance with UN's ''[[Sustainable Development Goals|Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]]''. The CBSS Expert Group on Sustainable Development created the '''Baltic 2030 Action Plan''', specifically tailored for the BSR to guide macro-regional stakeholders through the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The senior adviser was Krista Kampus.{{r|hist}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.balticseafuture.org/-/media/files/balticseafuture/krista-kampus.ashx&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, a presentation of the work involved to archive the targets was given in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seit.ee/file_dl.php?file_id=550&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
As a multinational team, members of Baltic 21 are government ministries and agencies from the 11 Baltic Sea states, the [[European Commission]], numerous intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations, academic and financial institutions, as well as local, city and business networks. The Baltic 21 network brings together people who are active in sectors including [[agriculture]], [[education]], [[energy]], [[fisheries]], [[forests]], [[industry]], [[tourism]], [[transport]] and [[spatial planning]].

The Baltic 21 process is steered, coordinated and monitored by the Senior Officials Group (SOG) consisting of representatives of the member countries, organizations and institutions.

[[File:Charaf-ed-Din. Operation for castration (1466).jpg|thumb|270px|A medical illustration by [[Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi|Sharaf ad-Din]] depicting an operation for castration, c. 1466]]
{{Violence against men}}
'''Castration''' (also known as '''gonadectomy''') is any action, [[surgery|surgical]], [[chemical substance|chemical]], or otherwise, by which an individual loses use of the [[testicles]]. Surgical castration is bilateral [[orchiectomy]] (excision of both testes), and [[chemical castration]] uses [[pharmaceutical drug]]s to deactivate the testes. Castration causes [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] (preventing the castrated person or animal from [[reproduction|reproducing]]); it also greatly reduces the production of certain [[hormone]]s, such as [[testosterone]]. Surgical castration in animals is often called [[neutering]].

The term "castration" is sometimes also used to refer to the removal of the [[ovary|ovaries]] in the female, otherwise known as an [[oophorectomy]] or, in animals, [[spaying]]. [[Estrogen]] levels drop precipitously following oophorectomy, and long-term effects of the reduction of sex hormones are significant throughout the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Prophylactic oophorectomy in pre-menopausal women and long term health – a review | pmc=2585770 | pmid=18714076 | doi=10.1258/mi.2008.008016 | volume=14 | date=September 2008 | journal=Menopause Int | pages=111–6 | last1 = Shuster | first1 = LT | last2 = Gostout | first2 = BS | last3 = Grossardt | first3 = BR | last4 = Rocca | first4 = WA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "castration" may also be sometimes used to refer to [[emasculation]] where both the testicles ''and'' the penis are removed together. In some cultures, and in some translations, no distinction is made between the two. This can cause confusion.

[[#Animals|Castration of non-human animals]] is intended to favor a desired development of the animal or of its habits, as an [[anaphrodisiac]] or to prevent [[overpopulation]]. As above, see [[neutering]] for more information on castration of non-human animals.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
[[File:The Mutiliation of Uranus by Saturn.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''The Castration of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]'': fresco by [[Vasari]] &amp; [[Cristofano Gherardi]] (c. 1560, Sala di Cosimo I, [[Palazzo Vecchio]], [[Florence]]).]]
Castration was frequently used for religious or social reasons in certain cultures in Europe, South Asia, Africa, and East Asia. After battles in some cases, winners castrated their captives or the corpses of the defeated to symbolize their victory and seize their "power". Castrated men — [[eunuch]]s – were often admitted to special social classes and were used particularly to staff [[bureaucracy|bureaucracies]] and palace households: in particular, the [[harem]]. Castration also figured in a number of religious castration cults. Other religions, such as [[Judaism]], were strongly opposed to the practice. The [[Leviticus]] [[Holiness code]], for example, specifically excludes eunuchs or any males with defective genitals from the priesthood, just as castrated animals are excluded from [[sacrifice]].

Eunuchs in China had been known to usurp power in many eras of [[History of China|Chinese history]], most notably in the [[Han Dynasty|Later Han]], late [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and late [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] dynasties. There are similar recorded Middle Eastern events.

In ancient times, castration often involved the [[emasculation|total removal of all the male genitalia]]. This involved great danger of death due to bleeding or infection and, in some states, such as the [[Byzantine Empire]], was seen as the same as a death sentence. Removal of only the testicles had much less risk.

Either surgical removal of both testicles or [[chemical castration]] may be carried out in the case of [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malecare.com |title=MaleCare.com |publisher=MaleCare.com |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Testosterone]]-depletion treatment (either surgical removal of both testicles or [[chemical castration]]) is used to slow down the cancer, greatly reduce sex drive or interest in those with sexual drives, obsessions, or behaviors, or any combination of those that may be considered deviant. 

Castration has also been used in the United States for [[sex offender]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=93947|title=Some Sex Offenders Opt for Castration. ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trans women]] often undergo orchiectomy, as do some other transgender people. Orchiectomy may be performed as part of a more general [[sex reassignment surgery]], either before or during other procedures. It may also be performed on someone who does not desire, or cannot afford, further surgery.

[[File:Castration.jpg|right|thumb|The procedure of castration as punishment during the 16th century.]]
Involuntary castration appears in the history of warfare, sometimes used by one side to torture or demoralize their enemies. It was practiced to extinguish opposing male lineages and thus allow the victor to sexually possess the defeated group's women.{{ref}}

===Europe===
[[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' reports castration of defeated foes at the hands of the [[Normans]] during their invasions of Sicily and Italy.{{ref?|date=February 2018}}

In the medieval [[kingdom of Georgia]], the [[pretender]] [[Demna of Georgia|Demna]] was castrated by his uncle [[George III of Georgia]] to ensure the supremacy of George's branch of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eastmond|first=Antony|title=Royal imagery in medieval Georgia|year=1998|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pa.|isbn=0271016280|page=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2KPdSQU-Bx4C&amp;pg=PA107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another victim of castration was the medieval French philosopher, scholar, teacher, and (later) monk [[Pierre Abélard]]. He was castrated by relatives of his lover, [[Heloise (student of Abelard)|Héloïse]].{{ref?|date=February 2018}}

[[Wimund (bishop)|Bishop Wimund]], a 12th-century English adventurer and invader of the Scottish coast, was castrated.{{ref?|date=February 2018}}

In medieval England those found guilty of high treason were [[hanged, drawn and quartered]], which often included [[emasculation]] or removal of the genitalia.{{ref?|date=February 2018}}

In [[Greek mythology|ancient Greek mythology]], [[Cronus]] castrated his father, [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], after the latter imprisoned the [[cyclops|Cyclopes]] and [[Hecatonchires]].

[[William Wallace]], the Scottish resistance leader, was castrated as part of his execution, for resistance to English rule.

[[Wim Deetman]] was criticized by the Dutch parliament for excluding evidence of castration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/time-truth-about-catholic-sex-abuse-netherlands|title=Time for the truth about Catholic sex abuse in the Netherlands|work=RNW|access-date=21 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321230333/http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/time-truth-about-catholic-sex-abuse-netherlands#|archive-date=21 March 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his report on sexual abuse by the Roman Catholic Church, where ten children were allegedly "punished" by castration in the 1950s for reporting sexual abuse by Roman Catholic priests. However, the Deetman Commission had rejected it as the person who reported the incident admitted it was speculative. Voluntary castration for homosexuality was also state policy in Netherlands at that point, as well against Catholic canon law, and there has been no evidence suggesting the Church had a part in organizing the procedures.
[[Chemical castration]] has been and is used as part of sentencing in criminal cases.

In 1952, [[Alan Turing]]—the father of computer science and the inventor of the [[Turing machine]]—was criminally prosecuted for homosexual acts and chose chemical castration as an alternative to a period of imprisonment.

===China===
According to legend, during the reign of the legendary Emperor Shun and Yu in China, in 2281 BCE castration was passed into law as a punishment, which remained so until the reign of [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Gaozu of Tang]] (589–600 CE).

During the reign of [[King Mu of Zhou|Mu]] of the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (10th c. BCE) the Minister of Crime, Marquis Lu, reformed the law in 950 BC to make it easier for people to be sentenced to castration instead of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oUkQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=castration+rape+china#v=snippet&amp;q=castration%20capital%20avoid&amp;f=false|title=China of the Chinese|author=Edward Theodore Chalmers Werner|year=1919|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|isbn=|page=146|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As long as the practice existed in China, not only were the testicles merely removed but castration included the severing of one's entire genitalia.

At the end of the [[Ming Dynasty]], there were about 70,000 eunuchs (宦官 ''huànguān'', or 太監 ''tàijiàn'') employed by the emperor, with some serving inside the [[Forbidden City]].

====Non-Han peoples====
Many of the non-Han Chinese peoples who founded states in China after invading originally did not have eunuchs as part of their culture, but adopted it from the Han Chinese.

The [[Khitan people]] adopted the practice of using eunuchs from the Chinese and the eunuchs used were non-Khitan prisoners of war. The Khitan were a [[nomad]]ic [[Mongols|Mongolic people]] and originally did not have eunuchs as part of their culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docin.com/p-220201686.html 祝建龙 (Zhu Jianlong), 二〇〇九年四月 (April 2009), 12.](Page 18 on online document viewer, Page 12 on actual document)&lt;/ref&gt; When the Khitan founded the [[Liao Dynasty]] they developed a [[harem]] system with concubines and wives and adopted eunuchs as part of it. All of the eunuchs were captured ethnic Chinese from the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plains]] that came from two sources. The Khitan captured Chinese people who were already eunuchs at the Jin court when they invaded of the [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]]. Another source was during their war with the Chinese [[Song dynasty]], the Khitan would raid China, capture Han Chinese boys as prisoners of war and [[emasculate]] them to become eunuchs. The emasculation of captured Chinese boys guaranteed a continuous supply of eunuchs to serve in the Liao Dynasty harem. The Empress Dowager Chengtian played a large role in the raids to capture and emasculate the boys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docin.com/p-220201686.html 祝建龙 (Zhu Jianlong), 二〇〇九年四月 (April 2009), 13.](Page 19 on online document viewer, Page 13 on actual document)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Khitan Empress Dowager [[Xiao Chuo]] (Chengtian) of the [[Liao Dynasty|Khitan Liao state]] took power at age 30 in 982 as a regent for her son. She personally led her own army against the [[Song dynasty|Song Chinese]] in 986 and defeated them in battle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KLNrqn4WLZYC&amp;pg=PA259&amp;dq=empress+xiao+986&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_FspUoKpO4T64APLwoHwBQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=empress%20xiao%20986&amp;f=false|title=Notable Women of China|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IXKkCXDvYFYC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=empress+xiao+986&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_FspUoKpO4T64APLwoHwBQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=empress%20xiao%20986&amp;f=false|title=Warfare in Chinese History|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1u2oP2RihIgC&amp;pg=PA569&amp;dq=empress+xiao+986&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_FspUoKpO4T64APLwoHwBQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=empress%20xiao%20986&amp;f=false|title=The History of the Medieval World: From the Conversion of Constantine to the ...|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxVfTuKsaJQC&amp;pg=PT91&amp;dq=empress+xiao+986&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_FspUoKpO4T64APLwoHwBQ&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=empress%20xiao%20986&amp;f=false|title=Harmony and War|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcy1N5GXs4wC&amp;pg=PT521&amp;dq=chengtian+986&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=f18pUviMLMez4AO214CQDA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6wEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=chengtian%20986&amp;f=false|title=China: A History|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; fighting the retreating Chinese army.

During the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasty (1644–1911 CE), the sons and grandsons of the rebel [[Yaqub Beg]] in China were all sentenced to castration. Surviving members of Yaqub Beg's family included his 4 sons, 4 grandchildren (2 grandsons and 2 granddaughters), and 4 wives. They either died in prison in [[Lanzhou]], Gansu, or were killed by the Chinese. His sons Yima Kuli, K'ati Kuli, Maiti Kuli, and grandson Aisan Ahung were the only survivors in 1879. They were all underage children, and put on trial, sentenced to an agonizing death if they were complicit in their father's rebellious "sedition", or if they were innocent of their fathers crimes, were to be sentenced to castration and serving as a [[eunuch]] slave to Chinese troops, when they reached 11 years old, and handed over to the Imperial Household to be executed or castrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yjg1AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=whether+they+have+attained+full+age+or+not,+be+delivered+imperial+household+made+eunuchs+slaves+to+soldiery+turkestan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wG3LTdKpMMG2twfnsOGFCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=whether%20they%20have%20attained%20full%20age%20or%20not%2C%20be%20delivered%20imperial%20household%20made%20eunuchs%20slaves%20to%20soldiery%20turkestan&amp;f=false|title=Translations of the Peking Gazette|year=1880|page=83|isbn=|accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DqYoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=whether+they+have+attained+full+age+or+not,+be+delivered+imperial+household+made+eunuchs+slaves+to+soldiery+turkestan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6m_LTdeEC8u3tgfeofTnBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The American annual cyclopedia and register of important events of the year ..., Volume 4|year=1888|publisher=D.

===Korea===
The eunuchs of Korea, called ''Naesi'' (내시, 內侍), were officials to the king and other royalty in traditional Korean society. The first recorded appearance of a Korean eunuch was in [[Goryeosa]] ("History of Goryeo"), a compilation about the [[Goryeo]] period. In 1392, with the founding of the [[Joseon Dynasty]], the ''Naesi'' system was revised, and the department was renamed the "Department of ''Naesi''" (내시부, 內侍府).&lt;ref name="Naesi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=367722 |title=내시 : 지식백과 |language=ko |publisher=100.naver.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Naesi system included two ranks, those of ''Sangseon'' (상선, 尙膳, "Chief of Naesi"), who held the official title of senior second rank, and ''Naegwan'' (내관, 內官, "Common official naesi"), both of which held rank as officers. 140 naesi in total served the palace in Joseon Dynasty period. They also took the exam on [[Confucianism]] every month.&lt;ref name="Naesi"/&gt; The naesi system was repealed in 1894 following [[Gabo reform]].

According to legend, castration consisted of daubing a boy's [[genital]]s with human [[feces]] and having a dog bite them off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-fc5X0cUjwC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;dq=Korean+eunuchs,+however,+had+it+worst+of+all.+In+ancient+times+they+were+castrated+by+having+their+genitals+smeared+with+human+feces+and+then+being+exposed+to+packs+of+hungry+dogs#v=onepage&amp;q=Korean%20eunuchs%2C%20however%2C%20had%20it%20worst%20of%20all.%20In%20ancient%20times%20they%20were%20castrated%20by%20having%20their%20genitals%20smeared%20with%20human%20feces%20and%20then%20being%20exposed%20to%20packs%20of%20hungry%20dogs&amp;f=false|title=Manthropology: The Science of Why the Modern Male Is Not the Man He Used to Be|author=Peter McAllister|year=2010|publisher=Macmillan|location=|isbn=0-312-55543-1|page=280|pages=|accessdate=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Yuan Dynasty]], eunuchs became a desirable commodity for [[tributes]], and dog bites were replaced by more sophisticated surgical techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3Y2PTI_vYYC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=korean+castrated+dog+bite#v=onepage&amp;q=korean%20castrated%20dog%20bite&amp;f=false|title=Children in slavery through the ages|author1=Gwyn Campbell |author2=Suzanne Miers |author3=Joseph Calder Miller |year=2009|publisher=Ohio University Press|location=|isbn=0-8214-1877-7|page=137|pages=|accessdate=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
The Vietnamese adopted the eunuch system and castration techniques from China. Records show that the Vietnamese created [[eunuch]]s through castration in a painful procedure by removing the entire genitalia with both penis and testicles being cut off with a sharp knife or metal blade. The procedure was agonizing since the entire penis was cut off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chuyện 'tịnh thân' hãi hùng của thái giám Việt xưa |url=http://vietbao.vn/Suc-khoe/Chuyen-tinh-than-hai-hung-cua-thai-giam-Viet-xua/2131549871/70/ |newspaper=Viet Bao |date= 5 October 2012|time= 14:00 (GMT+7) |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Chuyện 'tịnh thân' hãi hùng của thái giám Việt xưa|others= Theo ''Đất Việt''|url=http://ngoisao.net/tin-tuc/thoi-cuoc/24h/chuyen-tinh-than-hai-hung-cua-thai-giam-viet-xua-2621880.html |newspaper=Ngôi sao |date= 4 October 2012 |time=11:16 (GMT+7)|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Thê lương chuyện 'của quý' của thái giám Việt xưa|others= Báo Đất Việt|url= http://www.baomoi.com/The-luong-chuyen-cua-quy-cua-thai-giam-Viet-xua/139/9058145.epi|newspaper= Báo Mới|date= 5 August 2012 |time=19:25 (GMT+7) |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thê lương chuyện ‘của quý’ của thái giám Việt xưa |others=Theo Đất Việt |url=http://2sao.vn/p0c1048n20120808152150734/the-luong-chuyen-'cua-quy'-cua-thai-giam-viet-xua.vnn |newspaper=2sao |date=8 August 2012 |time=15:15 (GMT+7) |accessdate=27 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411133500/http://2sao.vn/p0c1048n20120808152150734/the-luong-chuyen-%27cua-quy%27-cua-thai-giam-viet-xua.vnn |archivedate=11 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thê lương chuyện 'của quý' của thái giám Việt xưa |others=ĐVO |url=http://www.treonline.com/the-luong-chuyen-cua-quy-cua-quai-giam-viet-xua.htm |newspaper=Treonline |date= |accessdate=27 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053555/http://www.treonline.com/the-luong-chuyen-cua-quy-cua-quai-giam-viet-xua.htm |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Hành trình đau khổ của những hoạn quan thời xưa|others= Theo ''Báo Đất Việt''|url= http://giadinh.net.vn/the-gioi/hanh-trinh-dau-kho-cua-nhung-hoan-quan-thoi-xua-20110824020430125.htm|newspaper= Báo Gia đình &amp; Xã hội|date=24 August 2011 |time=14:25 (GMT+7)|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Bí mật về thái giám trong cung triều Nguyễn|others= Theo Công An Nhân Dân|url= http://news.zing.vn/xa-hoi/bi-mat-ve-thai-giam-trong-cung-trieu-nguyen/a336065.html|newspaper=Zing News |date=18 July 2013 |time= 09:04 (GMT+7) |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The young man's thighs and abdomen would be tied and others would pin him down on a table.

[[Lý Thường Kiệt]] was a prominent eunuch general during the [[Lý Dynasty]] (1009–1225).

The [[Trần Dynasty]] sent Vietnamese boy eunuchs as tribute to [[Ming Dynasty]] China several times, in 1383, 1384 and 1385&lt;ref name="Tsai 1996 p. 15"&gt;Tsai (1996), p. 15  {{Google books|Ka6jNJcX_ygC|The Eunuchs in the Ming Dynasty (Ming Tai Huan Kuan)|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nguyen Dao, Nguyen Toan, Tru Ca, and Ngo Tin were among several Vietnamese eunuchs sent to China.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyẽ̂n (2008), p. 169  {{Google books|tUN8tC0ftJcC|The History Buddhism in Vietnam, Vol. IIID.5|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam]], the Ming Chinese under the [[Yongle Emperor]] castrated many young Vietnamese boys, choosing them for their handsomeness and ability, and brought them to Nanjing to serve as eunuchs. Among them were the architect-engineer [[Nguyễn An]]&lt;ref&gt;Wang (2000), p. 135  {{Google books|CdJKLd2jJq0C|Aching for Beauty: Footbinding in China|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nguyen Lang]] (阮浪).&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich (1976), p. 691  {{Google books|067On0JgItAC|Dictionary of Ming Biography, 1368–1644|page=691}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese were among the many eunuchs of different origins found at Yongle's court.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2009), p. 147  {{Google books|S3Y2PTI_vYYC|Children in Slavery Through the Ages|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the eunuchs in charge of the Capital Battalions of [[Beijing]] was Xing An, a Vietnamese.&lt;ref&gt;Tran (2006), p. 116  {{Google books|tzh1fQEEFPAC|Việt Nam: Borderless Histories|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Lê Dynasty]] the Vietnamese Emperor [[Lê Thánh Tông]] was aggressive in his relations with foreign countries including China. A large amount of trade between Guangdong and Vietnam happened during his reign. Early accounts recorded that the Vietnamese captured Chinese whose ships had blown off course and detained them. Young Chinese men were selected by the Vietnamese for castration to become eunuch slaves to the Vietnamese. It has been speculated by modern historians that the Chinese who were captured and castrated by the Vietnamese were involved in trade between China and Vietnam instead of actually being blown off course by the wind and they were punished as part of a crackdown on foreign trade by Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=明代广东海上丝绸之路的高度发展 |url=http://eco.guoxue.com/article.php/15591/8 |publisher=國學網－－中國經濟史論壇(China Economic History Forum) |date=2008-03-16 |author=黄啟臣 |accessdate=26 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053755/http://eco.guoxue.com/article.php/15591/8 |archivedate=21 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=明代广东海上丝绸之路的高度发展|url=http://www.zhgpl.com/crn-webapp/cbspub/secDetail.jsp?bookid=3222&amp;secid=3254|publisher=中國評論學術出版社(China Review Academic Publishers Unlimited)|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zhgpl.com/crn-webapp/cbspub/secDetail.jsp?bookid=3222&amp;secid=3257 |title=中国评论学术出版社 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zhgpl.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCreate.jsp?coluid=56&amp;kindid=1201&amp;docid=100107474&amp;mdate=0911123624 |title=中国评论新闻：郑和下西洋与广东商人的海外移民 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/doc/1001/0/7/4/100107474.html |title=鄭和下西洋與廣東商人的海外移民|publisher=中國評論新聞網 |accessdate=26 July 2013 |date=2006-03-08 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zhgpl.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCreate.jsp?coluid=6&amp;kindid=30&amp;docid=100107474 |title=中国评论新闻：郑和下西洋与广东商人的海外移民 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/doc/1001/0/7/4/100107474.html?coluid=56&amp;kindid=1201&amp;docid=100107474&amp;mdate=0911123624 |title=中國評論新聞 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCNML.jsp?coluid=55&amp;kindid=1160&amp;docid=100107474 |title=鄭和下西洋與廣東商人的海外移民 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCNML.jsp?coluid=56&amp;kindid=1201&amp;docid=100151090 |title=明代廣東海上絲綢之路的高度發展 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/doc/1001/5/1/0/100151090.html?coluid=56&amp;kindid=1201&amp;docid=100151090&amp;mdate=0911123624 |title=中國評論新聞 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCreate.jsp?coluid=56&amp;kindid=1201&amp;docid=100107474&amp;mdate=0911123624 |title=中國評論新聞：鄭和下西洋與廣東商人的海外移民 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=郑和下西洋与广东商人的海外移民人文历史|url=http://life.dayoo.com/edu/200910/20/75163_11076680.htm|publisher=广州日报大洋网(www.dayoo.com)|date=2009-10-20|others=published at 15:28 [[24-hour clock|military time]]|accessdate=26 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054046/http://life.dayoo.com/edu/200910/20/75163_11076680.htm|archivedate=21 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=貿易、移殖與文化交流:15–17 世紀廣東人與越南 |url=http://www.lib.cuhk.edu.hk/conference/occ/liqingxin.pdf |publisher=廣東省社會科學院歷史研究所 南開大學中國社會歷史研究中心 |accessdate=5 January 2013 |author=李慶新 |page=12 |quote=此外,沿海平民在海上航行或捕撈漁獵,遇風漂流至越南者時有發生。如成化十三年, 廣東珠池奉御陳彜奏:南海縣民遭風飄至安南被編入軍隊及被閹禁者超過 100 人。5成化中, 海南文昌人吳瑞與同鄉劉求等 13 人到欽州做生意,遇風飄至安南,當局將他們"俱發屯田, 以瑞獨少,宮之"。6... 6《明孝宗實錄》卷一百五十三,弘治十二年八月辛卯。 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JBWO91Ba?url=http://www.lib.cuhk.edu.hk/conference/occ/liqingxin.pdf |archivedate=27 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=貿易、移殖與文化交流:15–17 世紀廣東人與越南|url=http://wenku.baidu.com/view/fc9a0cdd50e2524de5187e89.html|publisher=廣東省社會科學院歷史研究所 南開大學中國社會歷史研究中心|accessdate=5 January 2013|author=李慶新|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1472 entry in the [[Ming Shilu]] reported that when some Chinese from [[Nanhai District|Nanhai county]] escaped back to China after their ship had been blown off course into Vietnam, where they had been forced to serve as soldiers in Vietnam's military. The escapees also reported that they found out up to 100 Chinese men remained captives in Vietnam after they were caught and castrated by the Vietnamese after their ships were blown off course into Vietnam. The Chinese Ministry of Revenue responded by ordering Chinese civilians and soldiers to stop going abroad to foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wade|2005|p=[http://epress.nus.edu.sg/msl/entry/1706 2078/79]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chinese State at the Borders |year=2007 |publisher=UBC Press |isbn=0774813334 |url=http://www.history.ubc.ca/faculty/lshin/research/pdf/07_shin_ubcp.pdf |author=Leo K.

A 1499 entry in the Ming Shilu recorded that 13 Chinese men from [[Wenchang]] including a young man named Wu Rui were captured by the Vietnamese after their ship was blown off course while traveling from [[Hainan]] to [[Guangdong]]'s Qin subprefecture ([[Qinzhou]]), after which they ended up near the coast of Vietnam, during the [[Chenghua Emperor]]'s rule (1447–1487). Twelve of them were enslaved to work as agricultural laborers, while the youngest, [[Wu Rui]] (吳瑞) was selected for castration since he was the only young man and he became a eunuch attendant at the [[Imperial Citadel of Thăng Long|Vietnamese imperial palace in Thang Long]]. After years of service, he was promoted at the death of the Vietnamese ruler in 1497 to a military position in northern Vietnam. A soldier told him of an escape route back to China and Wu Rui escaped to [[Longzhou County|Longzhou]]. The local chief planned to sell him back to the Vietnamese, but Wu was rescued by the [[Pingxiang, Guangxi|Pingxiang]] magistrate and then was sent to [[Beijing]] to work as a eunuch in the palace.&lt;ref&gt;Lary (2007), p. 91 {{Google books|pFzhWyoYG_wC|The Chinese State at the Borders|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chinese State at the Borders |year=2007 |publisher=UBC Press |isbn=0774813334 |url=http://www.history.ubc.ca/faculty/lshin/research/pdf/07_shin_ubcp.pdf |author=Leo K.

Commoners were banned from undergoing castration in Vietnam, only adult men of high social rank could be castrated, most eunuchs were born as such with a congenital abnormality.

===Americas===
In 1778, [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote a bill in Virginia reducing the punishment for rape, polygamy or sodomy from death to castration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendVIIIs10.htm Thomas Jefferson, A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments 1778 Papers 2:492—504l]&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years several U.S. states have passed laws regarding chemical castration for sex offenders but not one state has mandatory castration. In 2016, [[Steve Hurst]], an Alabama lawmaker proposed a bill requiring certain sex offenses to require the perpetrator be castrated prior to their release from state custody.&lt;ref name="CBS_US_Castration_Bill"&gt;{{cite news |title=Lawmaker introduces sex offender castration bill in Alabama |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lawmaker-introduces-sex-offender-castration-bill-in-alabama/ |accessdate=23 October 2018 |work=CBS News |date=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
Aqa [[Mohammad Khan Qajar]], who established the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] Dynasty in Iran (in the 18th century), was a victim of castration by officers of the previous kingdom. When he conquered [[Lotf Ali Khan]], the last king of the [[Zand Dynasty]], Qajar had  Lotf Ali Khan castrated in revenge.

==Slave trade==
[[File:V.M. Doroshevich-East and War-Eunuch near Door of Sultan's Harem.png|thumb|left|Chief Eunuch of [[Abdul Hamid II]] (1912)]]

In the over 13 centuries of the [[Arab slave trade]] in Africa unknown number of Africans were enslaved and shipped to the Middle East. It is claimed that a vast majority of the male black slaves, estimated at around 80%, were castrated.

"The Caliphate in Baghdad at the beginning of the 10th Century had 7,000 black eunuchs and 4,000 white eunuchs in his palace."&lt;ref name="amazon1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Islam's Black Slaves: The Other Black Diaspora |isbn = 978-0374527976|last1 = Segal|first1 = Ronald|date = 2002-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab slave trade typically dealt in the sale of castrated male slaves. Black boys at the age of eight to twelve had their scrotum and penis completely amputated. Reportedly, about two of three boys died, but those who survived drew high prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1210/jcem.84.12.6206| pmid=10599682|title = Long-Term Consequences of Castration in Men: Lessons from the Skoptzy and the Eunuchs of the Chinese and Ottoman Courts| journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism| volume=84| issue=12| pages=4324–4331|year = 1999|last1 = Wilson|first1 = Jean D.| last2=Roehrborn| first2=Claus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trafficking of boys for prostitution in modern times===
An article in the ''Gulf Times'' revealed in 2005 a major sex trade in mostly Nepalese boys who were lured to India and sold to brothels in [[Mumbai]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], New Delhi, [[Lucknow]] and [[Gorakhpur]]. One victim was lured from Nepal at the age of 14, sold into slavery, locked up, beaten, starved, and forcibly castrated. He reported that he was held in a brothel with 40 to 50 other boys, many of whom were also castrated. He escaped and made his way back to Nepal. Two [[non-governmental organization]]s, one that works with homosexuals in Nepal, and one that works to rescue and rehabilitate trafficked women and children, were co-operating to help and rescue these boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=32822&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=44&amp;parent_id=24 |title=Former sex worker's tale spurs rescue mission |date=10 April 2005 |work=Gulf Times |publisher=Gulf-Times.com |accessdate=5 October 2010 |quote=“I spent seven years in hell,” says Raju, now 21, trying hard not to cry.

==Preventive measure==
"Voluntary" chemical or surgical castration has been in practice in many countries—reports are available from American and European countries in particular for over eighty years (chemical for circa thirty)—as an option for treatment for people who have broken laws of a sexual nature, allowing them to return to the community from otherwise lengthy detentions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} The effectiveness and ethics of this treatment are heavily debated.

A ''temporary'' "chemical castration" has been studied and developed as a preventive measure and [[punishment]] for several repeated [[sex crime]]s, such as rape or other [[sexual assault|sexually related violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/biology/b103/f02/web1/kamlin.html|title=Chemical Castration: The Benefits and Disadvantages Intrinsic to Injecting Male Pedophiliacs with Depo-Provera|author=Katherine Amlin|accessdate=13 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.southcoasttoday.com/daily/04-97/04-27-97/a09wn032.htm|title='Chemical castration' OK'd for Montana inmates|publisher= N.Y.

In modern times, the [[Czech Republic]] practices surgically castrating convicted sex offenders. According to the reports compiled by Council of Europe, a human-rights forum, the central European country physically castrated at least 94 prisoners in the 10 years up to April 2008. The Czech Republic defends this procedure as voluntary and effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/documents/cze/2009-02-05-eng.htm |title=Council of Europe report on the Czech Republic |publisher=Cpt.coe.int |date=5 February 2009 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dr. Martin Hollý, director of the Psychiatric Hospital Bohnice in Prague, none of the nearly 100 sex offenders who had been physically castrated had committed further offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dan Bilefsky |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/world/europe/11castrate.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;hp |title=Europeans Debate Castration of Sex Offenders |location=Europe;Czech Republic |work=The New York Times |date=10 March 2009 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One serial offender stated that being castrated was the "best decision" he ever made: "On the one hand you have to protect the potential victims and on the other hand I wanted to be protected from myself, I wanted to live like a normal person."&lt;ref name="ukadvisor"/&gt; Don Grubin, a professor at [[Newcastle University]]'s Institute of Neuroscience who also runs a chemical castration program backed by the U.K.'s [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]], was initially opposed to physical castration.

===Criticism===
In nonhuman animals, the behavioral effects of gonad removal differ along lines of species and not sex, i.e. there are species where mating behavior ceases if the gonads are removed and other species where it does not cease, but removal of ovaries in females halt mating behavior in all of the same nonhuman animals in which male castration halts mating behavior. Therefore some scientists argue that the notion that castration/spaying would drastically reduce sex drive in human males but not in human females is zoologically nonsensical, citing that humans belong to the animal kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Aunger, Valerie Curtis (2015)"Gaining Control: How human behavior evolved"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2015). "The myth of female sexual complexity"&lt;/ref&gt;

Some criminologists argue that the apparently lower recidivism rates in castrated male sex offenders compared to non-castrated ones does not prove that it is a biological effect of castration (correlation does not equal causation) but can be explained by other factors. One suggested factor from [[game theory]] is that men who are willing to accept castration to get a shorter prison sentence are those who value freedom from prison higher than men who are not willing to pay the price for freedom in the form of their testicles. This hypothesis can explain their apparent lower recidivism as a result of working harder to conceal the evidence for their crimes, and argue that their parole is a danger of releasing offenders who only hide their crimes more efficiently and are not any less likely to commit new crimes. These criminologists also argue that police investigators treating castrated men as less likely to reoffend than non-castrated men may cause an investigation bias and [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].&lt;ref&gt;Christine Horne, Michael J. Lovaglia (2008). "Experiments in Criminology and Law: A Research Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lorie A. Fridell (2016). "Producing Bias-Free Policing: A Science-Based Approach"&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain neurologists argue that while testosterone most likely increases internal sexual stimulation, a reduction of sex drive is unlikely to result in a reduction of inappropriate sexual behavior, as reduced internal stimulation from hormones merely increases the required external stimulation to reach orgasm. These neurologists cite that spreading of brain activity that stimulate more brain activity can increase their activity and tire the circuits out, the brain’s path to orgasm, enough to tire out with less external stimulation if the internal signal is stronger, and require more specific external stimulation to reach “satisfaction” if the internal signal is weaker.{{clarification needed|date=January 2018}} Therefore, they argue, a reduced testosterone level would make it more difficult, not easier, to manage remaining vestiges of sex drive by masturbating without the use of pornography or to otherwise get by with more socially and legally acceptable substitutes for desires that it would be unacceptable to act on. These neurologists also cite that many people, both men and women, find that higher levels of initial sexual arousal make it easier to masturbate to orgasm without the preferred type of external stimuli, as predicted by the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;KC Berridge (2015). "Pleasure systems in the brain"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Feldman Barrett (2017). "How Emotions Are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
In Europe, when women were not permitted to sing in church or cathedral choirs in the Roman Catholic Church, boys were castrated to prevent their voices breaking at [[puberty]] and to develop a special high [[Register (music)|voice]]. The first documents mentioning ''[[castrato|castrati]]'' are Italian church records from the 1550s.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;John Rosselli, "Castrato" article in ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In the baroque and classical music eras these singers were highly appreciated by opera composers as well. [[Mozart]]'s ''Exultate Jubilate'', [[Gregorio Allegri|Allegri]]'s ''[[Gregorio Allegri#The Miserere|Miserere]]'' and other pieces from this period now sung by [[soprano]]s and countertenors were written for ''castrati''. Some of the alto parts of [[Handel]]'s [[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]] were first sung by a ''castrato''. ''Castrati'' include [[Farinelli]], [[Senesino]], [[Giovanni Carestini|Carestini]], and [[Caffarelli (castrato)|Caffarelli]]. The last true ''castrato'' was [[Alessandro Moreschi]] (1858–1922) who served in the [[Sistine Chapel Choir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ellis|first1=Samantha|title=All mouth and no trousers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/aug/05/classicalmusicandopera.artsfeatures|website=The Guardian|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the late 19th century that the Roman Catholic Church officially condemned the production of ''castrati''. In Modern times, the Mexican Javier Medina is the only professional opera singer that can perform as a castrato, since he suffered from an involuntary chemical castration, as a result from a cancer treatment that he had before he reached puberty.&lt;ref&gt;Javier Medina - "I'm A Natural Castrato" - The Finantial Times  [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/74d57b3c-a7b8-11dd-865e-000077b07658.html?ft_site=falcon&amp;desktop=true#axzz4QmGfBuQ8] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
A number of religions have included castration as a central theme of their practice. These include:

* The cult of [[Cybele]], in which devotees castrated themselves in ecstatic emulation of [[Attis]]: see [[Galli|Gallus]].
* [[Skoptsy]]
* The [[Valesians]].

===Hinduism===
In South Asia, many [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]]s live in well-defined, organized, all-hijra communities, led by a guru. The power of the hijras as a sexually ambiguous category can only be understood in the religious context of Hinduism. In some Hindu beliefs, ritual, and art, the power of the combined man/woman, or androgyne, is a frequent and significant theme. [[Bahuchara Mata]], the main object of hijra veneration, is specifically associated with transvestism and transgenderism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/South-Asia/Hijra-Religion-and-Expressive-Culture.html |title=Religion and expressive culture – Hijra |publisher=Everyculture.com |date= |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
While castration is not a major part of [[Christianity]], Jesus himself acknowledged in a discussion about avoiding adultery and divorce that some are involuntarily castrated or born that way, while some others "make themselves eunuchs" willingly out of a desire to be chaste {{bibleverse||Matthew|19:1–12|KJV}}.  Given Jesus' frequent use of metaphor and hyperbole, e.g. {{bibleverse||Luke|9:62|KJV}}, the church has broadly discouraged any understanding of this passage as recommending literal "self-castration".  That is consistent with Jesus' claims (as a rabbi) to uphold the Law given to Moses, e.g. {{bibleverse||Matthew|5:17|KJV}}, a Law which also discouraged literal castration {{bibleverse||Deut|23:1|KJV}}.  However, in his own comments Jesus had no condemnation for any of the above.  In {{bibleverse||Acts|8:34–8:39|KJV}}, a eunuch is baptized by [[Philip the Evangelist]], demonstrating acceptance of castrated individuals in his church.

The first canon of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 AD forbid clergy members to voluntarily castrate themselves "when in perfect health", but freely accepted those who had been either castrated by others against their will, castrated due to a medical sickness or necessity, or those born as eunuchs.

Paul, arguing against self-righteousness regarding [[circumcision]] in {{bibleverse||Galatians|5:12|KJV}}, says ''As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves!'' ([[New International Version|NIV]])

Well-known Christian eunuchs (or alleged eunuchs) include:

* [[Origen]], who is reported by [[Church History (Eusebius)|Eusebius]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.xi.viii.html |title=NPNF2-01. Eusebius Pamphilius: Church History, Life of Constantine, Oration in Praise of Constantine |publisher=Ccel.org |date=13 July 2005 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to have castrated himself based on his reading of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|19:12|}} and other passages in Matthew and Mark that appear to endorse voluntary amputation to avoid sin, although there is some doubt concerning this story. [[Philip Schaff|Schaff]] considers the account genuine but cites [[Ferdinand Christian Baur|Baur]] ''et al.'' in opposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.xi.viii.html Eusebius' Church History Book 6, Chapter 8 Origen's Daring Deed] note 1809: "This act of Origen’s has been greatly discussed, and some have even gone so far as to believe that he never committed the act ... There is no reason, however, to doubt the report, for which we have unimpeachable testimony, and which is in itself not at all surprising ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Origen argues against such literal interpretations of the passages from Matthew and Mark in his &lt;cite&gt;First Principles&lt;/cite&gt;.
* Bishop [[Melito of Sardis]] (d. ''ca'' 180), who was a [[eunuch]], according to the church history of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], though, significantly the word "virgin" was substituted in [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]]' Latin translation of Eusebius.
* [[Boston Corbett]], who was inspired by this same verse {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|19:12|}} to castrate himself (Corbett was the 19th-century American soldier who is generally believed to have fired the shot that killed [[John Wilkes Booth]]).

===Judaism===
[[Judaism]] strictly forbids the castration of either humans or animals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud]] [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbos]] 110b&lt;/ref&gt; Deuteronomy 23:1 expels castrated men from the assembly of Israel; they are forbidden to marry or if married must divorce from their wives (though permitting the castrated to marry or remain married to female converts to Judaism). The laws of castration including cases of irreversible or un-reversed vasectomy and all other cases where the flow of sperm is known to have been placed into a permanent state of dysfunction with either no hope or no desire to take the steps to repair.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aish.com/atr/Vasectomy.html&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation reinforced by Isaiah 56:3–5 encourages eunuchs who follow after God's laws.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

According to [[Rashi]], Kham (Ham) castrated his father Noah.

In Judaism, castrated animals are deemed unfit for [[sacrifice]] in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] ({{bibleverse||Lev|22:24|}}). Castrated members of the priestly caste are forbidden to enter certain parts of the temple, to approach the altar, or to make sacrifices, although they could eat their share of the offerings and receive the priestly and Levite gifts (Lev. 21:16–24).

===Islam===
In Islam castration is considered a sin, whether one performs it on himself or on another. As Abdullah ibn Mas'ood said "We were on a campaign with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and we had no women with us. We said: Why don’t we get ourselves castrated? But he forbade us to do that." The wisdom behind the prohibition on castration is that it is contrary to what the Lawgiver wants of increasing reproduction to ensure continuation of jihad against the disbelievers. Otherwise, if permission had been given for that, then many people would have done that, and reproduction would have ceased, and the numbers of Muslims would have become less as a result, and the numbers of disbelievers would have increased, and that is contrary to the purpose for which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was sent. &lt;ref&gt;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/126987/the-ruling-on-castration&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

A subject of castration who is altered before the onset of [[puberty]] will retain a high voice, non-muscular build, and small genitals. He may well be shorter than average, as the production of sex hormones in puberty—more specifically, estrogen via aromatization of testosterone—stops long bone growth. The person may not develop [[pubic hair]] and will have a small sex drive or [[Asexuality|none at all]].

Castrations after the onset of puberty will typically reduce the sex drive considerably or eliminate it altogether. Castrated people are automatically [[Infertility|sterile]], because the [[testes]] (for males) and [[ovaries]] (for females) produce [[sex cells]] needed for [[sexual reproduction]]. Once removed, the subject is infertile. The voice does not change. Some castrated people report mood changes, such as depression or a more serene outlook on life, although this might not be due to chemical changes but instead emotional changes due to the implications of the procedure. Body strength and muscle mass can decrease somewhat. Body hair may sometimes decrease. Castration prevents [[male pattern baldness]] if it is done before hair is lost. However, castration will not restore hair growth after hair has already been lost due to male pattern baldness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Historically, many eunuchs who additionally underwent a [[penectomy]] reportedly suffered from urinary incontinence associated with the removal of the penis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medspe.fr/site/templates/template.php?identifiant_article=2166&amp;surlignage=2&amp;PHPSESSID=bd0a2427de5e5665b9c541ca8a6ecc71 |title=The various types of eunuch in the Byzantine state: their role and symbolic meaning |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113171516/http://www.medspe.fr/site/templates/template.php?identifiant_article=2166&amp;surlignage=2&amp;PHPSESSID=bd0a2427de5e5665b9c541ca8a6ecc71 |archivedate=2007-11-13 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] (HRT), typical symptoms (similar to those experienced by menopausal women) include hot flashes, gradual bone-density loss resulting in osteopenia or osteoporosis, and potential weight gain or redistribution of body fat to the hips and chest. Replacement of testosterone in the form of gel, patches, or injections can largely reverse these effects, although breast enlargement has also been reported as a possible side effect of testosterone usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthandage.com/public/health-center/28/article/3047/gm=20!gid2=2824 |title="HRT for Men Is Risky, Too" by Robert W.

A study conducted at a mental institution in Kansas, where a large number of male inmates had been castrated, found that the eunuchs lived an average of 14 years longer than the uncastrated men.&lt;ref name="longevity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-women-live-longer&amp;page=2|title=Why Women Live Longer}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar study of 81 historical eunuchs in Korea's royal court found a 14 to 19 year increase in lifespan compared to intact men of similar socioeconomic background; these eunuchs had a [[centenarian]] rate of over 3%.&lt;ref name="koreaeun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vitals.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/24/14070451-upside-to-castration-eunuchs-lived-longer-study-finds|title=Upside to castration?

==Psychoanalysis and literary theory==
The concept of castration plays an important role in [[psychoanalysis]]; ''see'', for example, [[castration anxiety]].

Castration (as a metaphor) also plays an important role in psychoanalytically-influenced literary theory, for example [[Harold Bloom]]'s ''[[The Anxiety of Influence]]''.

In the Mexican thriller ''[[La casa del pelícano]]'', castration is shown as being connected to the [[Oedipus complex]].

==Chemical castration==
{{Main|Chemical castration}}
In the case of chemical castration, ongoing regular injections of [[anti-androgen]]s are required. Chemical castration does not actually remove the testicles or ovaries of the subject,&lt;ref name=WashPost&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/04/AR2006070400960_pf.html "Can Castration Be a Solution for Sex Offenders?

Chemical castration seems to have a greater effect on bone density than physical castration.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Since the development of [[teriparatide]], this severe bone loss has been able to be reversed in nearly every case.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} At this time there is a limitation on the use of this medication to 24 months until the long-term use is better evaluated.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Animals==
{{see also|Neutering|Veterinary sterilization surgery}}
[[File:Castration horse.jpg|thumb|Castration being performed on a horse under [[ketamine]] [[anaesthesia]].]]
Humans commonly castrate domestic animals not intended for breeding.
Domestic animals are usually castrated to avoid unwanted or uncontrolled [[sexual reproduction|reproduction]]; to reduce or prevent other manifestations of [[animal sexual behavior|sexual behaviour]] such as defending the herd from humans and other threats, or intra-herd aggression (e.g. fighting between groups of entire (uncastrated) males of a species); or to reduce other consequences of sexual behavior that may make animal husbandry more difficult, such as boundary/fence/enclosure destruction when attempting to get to nearby females of the species.

Male horses are usually castrated ([[gelding|gelded]]) using [[emasculator]]s, because [[Stallion (horse)|stallion]]s are rather aggressive and troublesome. The same applies to male [[mule]]s, although they are sterile. Male cattle are castrated to improve fattening and docility in feedlots or for use as [[oxen]].
[[Selective breeding|Breeding]] individuals are kept [[entire (animal)|entire]] and used for breeding: they may fetch higher prices when sold.

Livestock may be castrated when used for food to increase growth or weight or both of individual male animals{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} and because of the undesirable taste and odor of the meat from sexually mature males. In [[domestic pig]]s the taint, called [[boar taint]], is caused by [[androstenone]] and [[skatole]] concentrations stored in the fat tissues of the animal after sexual maturity.&lt;ref name="GEN"&gt;[http://mark.asci.ncsu.edu/nsif/99proc/squires.htm Genetics of Boar Taint: Implications for the Future Use of Intact Males] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031092222/http://mark.asci.ncsu.edu/nsif/99proc/squires.htm |date=31 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boar taint is only found in a small minority of pigs and can be controlled through breeding selection, diet and management.&lt;ref name="pigsite"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepigsite.com/articles/3245/managing-boar-taint-focus-on-genetic-markers/ |title=Managing Boar Taint: Focus on Genetic Markers |publisher=The Pig Site |date=12 August 2007 |accessdate=5 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150415192046/http://www.thepigsite.com/articles/3245/managing-boar-taint-focus-on-genetic-markers/ |archivedate=15 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is released when the fat is heated and has a distinct odor and flavor that is widely considered unpalatable to consumers.&lt;ref name="PSU"&gt;[http://www.research.psu.edu/ipo/faculty_staff/disclosures/Greger_97_1751.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210034407/http://www.research.psu.edu/ipo/faculty_staff/disclosures/Greger_97_1751.html|date=10 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in commercial meat production, male pigs are either castrated shortly after birth or slaughtered before they reach sexual maturity.&lt;ref name = "PSU"/&gt; Recent research in Brazil has shown that castration of pigs is unnecessary because most pigs do not have the 'boar taint'. This is due to many breeds of pigs simply not having the heredity for the boar taint and the fact that pigs are normally slaughtered at a young market weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepigsite.com/articles/3950/mythbusting-boar-taint/ |title=Mythbusting Boar Taint|publisher=The Pig Site |accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of pets, castration is usually called [[neutering]], and is encouraged to prevent overpopulation of the community by unwanted animals, and to reduce certain diseases such as prostate disease and testicular cancer in male dogs (oophorectomy in female pets is often called [[spaying]]). Testicular cancer is rare in dogs, and also prostate problems are somewhat common in castrated male dogs when they get older.&lt;ref name=Teske&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0303-7207(02)00261-7 |title=Canine prostate carcinoma: epidemiological evidence of an increased risk in castrated dogs |date=2002 |last1=Teske |first1=E. |journal=Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology |volume=197 |pages=251–5 |pmid=12431819 |first2=E.

A. |issue=1–2 |last2=Naan |last3=Van Dijk |last4=Van Garderen |last5=Schalken}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neutered individuals have a much higher risk of developing prostate problems in comparison. Castrated male cats are more likely to develop an obstruction in their urethra, preventing them from urinating to some degree&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=11345305 |doi=10.2460/javma.2001.218.1429 |date=2001 |author1=Lekcharoensuk |first2=C.

A specialized vocabulary has arisen for neutered animals of given species:

&lt;!--Please add in alphabetical order--&gt;
*[[Pig#Pig vocabulary|Barrow]] (pig)
*[[Cattle#Terminology|Bullock]] (cattle)
*[[Capon]] (chicken)
*[[Gelding]] (horse)
*Gib (cat, ferret)
*[[Ox]] (cattle) (Castration performed on mature bull)
*Stag (cattle, sheep)
*[[Cattle#Terminology|Steer]] (cattle) (Castration performed on young calf)
*[[Wikt:wether|Wether]] (sheep, goat)

An incompletely castrated male in livestock species (horse and cattle) is known as a ''rig''.

The term ''stag'' is used for a male animal castrated after the [[secondary sex characteristic]]s have developed to such a point as to give him the appearance of [[sexual maturity]].

[[File:Elastrator rings.JPG|thumb|Rubber rings and pliers used in [[elastration]]]]
Methods of [[veterinary medicine|veterinary]] castration include instant [[surgical]] removal, the use of an [[elastrator]] tool to secure a band around the testicles that disrupts the blood supply, the use of a [[Burdizzo]] tool or [[emasculator]]s to crush the [[spermatic cord]]s and disrupt the blood supply, [[pharmacological]] [[Injection (medicine)|injection]]s and [[implant (medicine)|implant]]s and [[immunological]] techniques to [[inoculation|inoculate]] the animal against his own [[sex hormones|sexual hormones]].

Certain animals, like horses and [[swine]], are usually surgically treated with a scrotal castration (which can be done with the animal standing while sedated and after local anesthetic has been applied), while others, like dogs and cats, are anesthetised and recumbent when surgically castrated with a pre-scrotal incision in the case of dogs, or a pre-scrotal or scrotal incision used for cats.

In veterinary practice an "open" castration refers to a castration in which the inguinal tunic is incised and not sutured. A "closed" castration refers to when the procedure is performed so that the inguinal tunic is sutured together after incision.

==Parasitic infection==
{{main|Parasitic castration}}
Some [[parasite|parasitic]] [[nematode]]s chemically castrate their hosts. For example, ''[[Microphallus]] pseudopygmaeus'' chemically castrates its host, the snail ''[[Onoba aculeus]]'', and causes it to grow larger than normal.

In [[set theory]], the '''complement''' of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|''A''}} refers to [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] not in {{math|''A''}}.

When all sets under consideration are considered to be [[subset]]s of a given set {{math|''U''}}, the '''absolute complement''' of {{math|''A''}} is the set of elements in {{math|''U''}} but not in {{math|''A''}}.

The '''relative complement'''  of {{math|''A''}} with respect to a set {{math|''B''}}, also termed the '''difference''' of sets {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}, written {{math|''B'' ∖ ''A''}}, is the set of elements in {{math|''B''}} but not in {{math|''A''}}.

==Absolute complement==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Bayes' theorem]] and [[absolute set complement]] --&gt;

[[File:Venn1010.svg|250px|thumb|The '''absolute complement''' of {{mvar|A}} (left circle) in ''U'':
&lt;math&gt;A^c = U \setminus A&lt;/math&gt;.]]

===Definition===
If {{math|''A''}} is a set, then the '''absolute complement''' of {{math|''A''}} (or simply the '''complement of {{math|''A''}}''') is the set of elements not in {{math|''A''}}. In other words, if {{math|''U''}} is the [[universe (mathematics)|universe]] that contains all the elements under study, and there is no need to mention it because it is obvious and unique, then the absolute complement of {{math|''A''}} is the relative complement of {{math|''A''}} in {{math|''U''}}:&lt;ref&gt;The set other than {{math|''A''}} is thus implicitly mentioned in an absolute complement, and explicitly mentioned in a relative complement.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A^c = U \setminus A&lt;/math&gt;.

Formally:

:&lt;math&gt;A^c = \{ x\in U \mid x \notin A \}.&lt;/math&gt;

The absolute complement of {{math|''A''}} is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;A^c&lt;/math&gt;. Other notations include &lt;math&gt;\overline A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\complement_U A&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\complement A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Bou"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1970|p=E II.6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
* Assume that the universe is the set of [[integer]]s. If {{math|''A''}} is the set of odd numbers, then the complement of {{math|''A''}} is the set of even numbers. If {{math|''B''}} is the set of [[Multiple (mathematics)|multiples]] of 3, then the complement of {{math|''B''}} is the set of numbers [[Modular arithmetic|congruent]] to 1 or 2 modulo 3 (or, in simpler terms, the integers that are not multiples of 3).
* Assume that the universe is the [[standard 52-card deck]]. If the set {{math|''A''}} is the suit of spades, then the complement of {{math|''A''}} is the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of the suits of clubs, diamonds, and hearts. If the set {{math|''B''}} is the union of the suits of clubs and diamonds, then the complement of {{math|''B''}} is the union of the suits of hearts and spades.

===Properties===
Let {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} be two sets in a universe {{math|''U''}}. The following identities capture important properties of absolute complements:

: [[De Morgan's laws]]:&lt;ref name="Halmos-1960" /&gt;

::* &lt;math&gt;\left(A \cup B \right)^c=A^c \cap B^c.&lt;/math&gt;
::* &lt;math&gt;\left(A \cap B \right)^c=A^c\cup B^c.&lt;/math&gt;

: Complement laws:&lt;ref name="Halmos-1960" /&gt;

::* &lt;math&gt;A \cup A^c = U .&lt;/math&gt;
::* &lt;math&gt;A \cap A^c =\varnothing .&lt;/math&gt;
::* &lt;math&gt;\varnothing^c =U.&lt;/math&gt;
::* &lt;math&gt; U^c =\varnothing.&lt;/math&gt;
::* &lt;math&gt;\text{If }A\subseteq B\text{, then }B^c\subseteq A^c.&lt;/math&gt;
::*: (this follows from the equivalence of a conditional with its [[contrapositive]]).

: [[involution (mathematics)|Involution]] or double complement law:

::* &lt;math&gt;(A^c)^c=A.&lt;/math&gt;

: Relationships between relative and absolute complements:

::* &lt;math&gt;A \setminus B = A \cap B^c.&lt;/math&gt;
::* &lt;math&gt;(A \setminus B)^c = A^c \cup B.&lt;/math&gt;

: Relationship with set difference:
::* &lt;math&gt; A^c \setminus B^c = B \setminus A. &lt;/math&gt;

The first two complement laws above show that if {{math|''A''}} is a non-empty, [[proper subset]] of {{math|''U''}}, then {{math|{''A'', ''A''&lt;sup&gt;∁&lt;/sup&gt;}{{null}}}} is a [[partition of a set|partition]] of {{math|''U''}}.

== Relative complement ==

[[difference (set theory)]], [[difference of two sets]], [[relative complement]], [[set-theoretic difference]], [[set difference]], [[set minus]], [[set subtraction]], [[set theoretic difference]], [[setminus]] --&gt;

===Definition===
If {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} are sets, then the '''relative complement''' of {{math|''A''}} in {{math|''B''}},&lt;ref name="Halmos-1960"&gt;{{harvnb|Halmos|1960|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; also termed the '''set difference''' of {{math|''B''}} and {{math|''A''}},&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devlin|1979|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is the set of elements in {{math|''B''}} but not in {{math|''A''}}.

[[File:Venn0010.svg|250px|thumb|The '''relative complement''' of {{math|''A''}} (left circle) in {{math|''B''}} (right circle):
&lt;math&gt;B \cap A^c = B \setminus A&lt;/math&gt;]]

The relative complement of {{math|''A''}} in {{math|''B''}} is denoted {{nowrap|{{math|''B'' ∖ ''A''}}}} according to the [[ISO 31-11#Sets|ISO 31-11 standard]]. It is sometimes written {{nowrap|{{math|''B'' − ''A''}}}}, but this notation is ambiguous, as in some contexts it can be interpreted as the set of all elements {{nowrap|{{math|''b'' − ''a''}}}}, where {{math|''b''}} is taken from {{math|''B''}} and {{math|''a''}} from {{math|''A''}}.

Formally:

: &lt;math&gt;B \setminus A = \{ x\in B \mid x \notin A \}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Examples===
* &lt;math&gt;\{ 1, 2, 3\} \setminus \{ 2,3,4\} = \{ 1 \}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\{ 2, 3, 4 \} \setminus \{ 1,2,3 \} = \{ 4 \} &lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[real number]]s and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[rational number]]s, then &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[irrational number]]s.

===Properties===
Let {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}}, and {{math|''C''}} be three sets. The following [[identity (mathematics)|identities]] capture notable properties of relative complements:

:* &lt;math&gt;C \setminus (A \cap B) = (C \setminus A) \cup (C \setminus B)&lt;/math&gt;.
:* &lt;math&gt;C \setminus (A \cup B) = (C \setminus A) \cap (C \setminus B)&lt;/math&gt;.
:* &lt;math&gt;C \setminus (B \setminus A) = (C \cap A) \cup (C \setminus B)&lt;/math&gt;,
:*:with the important special case &lt;math&gt;C \setminus (C \setminus A) = (C \cap A)&lt;/math&gt; demonstrating that intersection can be expressed using only the relative complement operation.
:* &lt;math&gt;(B \setminus A) \cap C = (B \cap C) \setminus A = B \cap (C \setminus A)&lt;/math&gt;.
:* &lt;math&gt;(B \setminus A) \cup C = (B \cup C) \setminus (A \setminus C)&lt;/math&gt;.
:* &lt;math&gt;A \setminus A = \empty&lt;/math&gt;.
:* &lt;math&gt;\empty \setminus A = \empty&lt;/math&gt;.
:* &lt;math&gt;A \setminus \empty = A&lt;/math&gt;.
:* &lt;math&gt;A \setminus U = \empty&lt;/math&gt;.

== LaTeX notation ==

In the [[LaTeX]] typesetting language, the command &lt;code&gt;\setminus&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name="The Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List"&gt;[http://ctan.unsw.edu.au/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf] The Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List&lt;/ref&gt; is usually used for rendering a set difference symbol, which is similar to a [[backslash]] symbol. When rendered, the &lt;code&gt;\setminus&lt;/code&gt; command looks identical to &lt;code&gt;\backslash&lt;/code&gt; except that it has a little more space in front and behind the slash, akin to the LaTeX sequence &lt;code&gt;\mathbin{\backslash}&lt;/code&gt;. A variant &lt;code&gt;\smallsetminus&lt;/code&gt; is available in the amssymb package.

== Complements in various programming languages ==

Some programming languages allow for manipulation of [[set (computer science)|sets as data structures]], using these operators or functions to construct the difference of sets &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1232">'''DUAL''' is a general [[cognitive architecture]] integrating the [[connectionist]] and [[symbol]]ic approaches at the micro level. DUAL is based on decentralized representation and [[emergence|emergent computation]]. It was inspired by the [[Society of Mind]] idea proposed by [[Marvin Minsky]] but departs from the initial proposal in many ways. Computations in DUAL emerge from the interaction of many micro-agents each of which is hybrid symbolic/connectionist device. The agents exchange messages and activation via links that can be learnt and modified, they form coalitions which collectively represent concepts, episodes, and facts. 

Several models have been developed on the basis of DUAL. These include: [[AMBR]] (a model of analogy-making and memory), JUDGEMAP (a model of judgment), PEAN (a model of perception), etc.

DUAL is developed by a team at the [[New Bulgarian University]] led by [[Boicho Kokinov]]. The second version was co-authored by Alexander Petrov. The third version is co-authored by Georgi Petkov and Ivan Vankov.

The '''decline in amphibian populations''' is an ongoing [[mass extinction]] of [[amphibian]] species worldwide. Since the 1980s, decreases in amphibian populations, including [[Population decline|population crashes]] and mass localized [[extinction]]s, have been observed in locations all over the world. These declines are known as one of the most critical threats to global [[biodiversity]], and several causes are believed to be involved, including [[disease]], [[habitat destruction]] and modification, exploitation, [[pollution]], [[pesticide]] use, [[introduced species]], and [[ultraviolet-B]] radiation (UV-B). However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and the topic is currently a subject of much ongoing research. Calculations based on extinction rates suggest that the current extinction rate of amphibians could be 211 times greater than the [[background extinction rate]] and the estimate goes up to 25,000–45,000 times if endangered species are also included in the computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCallum |first1=M.

Although scientists began observing reduced populations of several European amphibian species already in the 1950s, awareness of the phenomenon as a global problem and its subsequent classification as a modern-day mass extinction only dates from the 1980s. By 1993, more than 500 species of frogs and salamanders present on all five continents were in decline. Today, the phenomenon of declining amphibian populations affects thousands of species in all types of ecosystems and is thus recognized as one of the most severe examples of the [[Holocene extinction]], with severe implications for global [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frightening statistics - Amphibian Ark|url=http://www.amphibianark.org/the-crisis/frightening-statistics/|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{wikinews|Largest mass extinction in 65 million years underway, scientists say}}
In the past three decades, declines in populations of amphibians (the [[Class (biology)|class]] of organisms that includes [[frogs]], [[toads]], [[salamanders]], [[newts]], and [[caecilians]]) have occurred worldwide. In 2004, the results were published of the first worldwide assessment of amphibian populations, the Global Amphibian Assessment. This found that 32% of species were globally threatened, at least 43% were experiencing some form of population decrease, and that between 9 and 122 species have become extinct since 1980.&lt;ref name="stuart"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stuart |first1=Simon N. |last2=Chanson |first2=Janice S. |last3=Cox |first3=Neil A. |last4=Young |first4=Bruce E. |last5=Rodrigues |first5=Ana S.

Habitat loss, disease and climate change are thought to be responsible for the drastic decline in populations in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation International - Amphibians|url=http://www.conservation.org/learn/biodiversity/species/profiles/amphibians/Pages/overview.aspx|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Declines have been particularly intense in the western [[United States]], [[Central America]], [[South America]], eastern [[Australia]] and [[Fiji]] (although cases of amphibian extinctions have appeared worldwide). While human activities are causing a loss of much of the world's biodiversity, amphibians appear to be suffering much greater effects than other classes of organism. Because amphibians generally have a two-staged life cycle consisting of both [[aquatic animal|aquatic]] ([[larva]]e) and [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] ([[adult]]) phases, they are sensitive to both terrestrial and [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic environmental]] effects.  Because their skins are highly permeable, they may be more susceptible to [[toxins]] in the environment than other organisms such as birds or mammals.&lt;ref name="onethird"&gt;''Science Daily'' (October 15, 2004), [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/10/041015103700.htm Amphibians in dramatic decline: Study finds nearly one third of species threatened with extinction]. Sciencedaily.com. Retrieved on September 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many scientists believe that amphibians serve as "[[Animal sentinel#Historical examples|canaries in a coal mine]]," and that declines in amphibian populations and species indicate that other groups of animals and plants will soon be at risk.&lt;ref name="onethird"/&gt;

Declines in amphibian populations were first widely recognized in the late 1980s{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}, when a large gathering of [[herpetology|herpetologists]] reported noticing declines in populations in amphibians across the globe.&lt;ref name="blaustein"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blaustein | first1 = A.R. | last2 = Wake | first2 = D.B. | year = 1990 | title = Declining amphibian populations: a global phenomenon? | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology and Evolution | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 203–204 | doi=10.1016/0169-5347(90)90129-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among these species, the [[Golden toad]] (''Bufo periglenes'') [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Monteverde]], [[Costa Rica]], featured prominently.  It was the subject of scientific research until populations suddenly crashed in 1987 and it had disappeared completely by 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crump | first1 = M.L. | last2 = Hensley | first2 = F.R. | last3 = Clark | first3 = K.I. | year = 1992 | title = Apparent decline of the golden toad: Underground or extinct? | url = | journal = Copeia | volume = 1992 | issue = | pages = 413–420 | doi=10.2307/1446201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other species at Monteverde, including the Monteverde Harlequin Frog (''[[Atelopus varius]]''), also disappeared at the same time. Because these species were located in the pristine Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, and these extinctions could not be related to local human activities, they raised particular concern among biologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=J. Alan Pounds |author2=Martha L.

== Initial skepticism ==
When amphibian declines were first presented as a conservation issue in the late 1980s, some scientists remained unconvinced of the reality and gravity of the conservation issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pechmann | first1 = J.H.K. | last2 = Scott | first2 = D.E. | last3 = Semlitsch | first3 = R.D. | last4 = Caldwell | first4 = J.P. | last5 = Vitt | first5 = L.J. | last6 = Gibbons | first6 = J.W. | year = 1991 | title = Declining amphibian populations: the problem of separating human impacts from natural fluctuations | url = | journal = Science | volume = 253 | issue = 5022| pages = 892–895 | doi=10.1126/science.253.5022.892 | pmid=17751826}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some biologists argued that populations of most organisms, amphibians included, naturally vary through time.  They argued that the lack of long-term data on amphibian populations made it difficult to determine whether the anecdotal declines reported by biologists were worth the (often limited) time and money of conservation efforts.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

However, since this initial skepticism, biologists have come to a consensus that declines in amphibian populations are a real and severe threat to biodiversity.&lt;ref name="stuart" /&gt; This consensus emerged with an increase in the number of studies that monitored amphibian populations, direct observation of mass mortality in pristine sites that lacked apparent cause, and an awareness that declines in amphibian populations are truly global in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Houlahan | first1 = J.E. | last2 = Findlay | first2 = C.S. | last3 = Schmidt | first3 = B.R. | last4 = Meyer | first4 = A.H. | last5 = Kuzmin | first5 = S.L. | year = 2000 | title = Quantitative evidence for global amphibian population declines | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 404 | issue = | pages = 752–758 | doi = 10.1038/35008052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential causes ==
Numerous potential explanations for amphibian declines have been proposed.  Most or all of these causes have been associated with some population declines, so each cause is likely to affect in certain circumstances but not others. Many of the causes of amphibian declines are well understood, and appear to affect other groups of organisms as well as amphibians.  These causes include habitat modification and fragmentation, introduced predators or competitors, introduced species, pollution, pesticide use, or over-harvesting. However, many amphibian declines or extinctions have occurred in pristine habitats where the above effects are not likely to occur.  The causes of these declines are complex, but many can be attributed to emerging diseases, climate change, increased ultraviolet-B radiation, or long-distance transmission of chemical contaminants by wind.

Artificial lighting has been suggested as another potential cause. Insects are attracted to lights making them scarcer within the amphibian habitats.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenbeis, G., 2006.

Island Press: 281-304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = B.J. | last2 = Richardson | first2 = J.M.L. | year = 2006 | title = The effect of artificial light on male breeding-season behaviour in green frogs, ''Rana clamitans melanota'' | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology | volume = 84 | issue = | pages = 1528–1532 | doi=10.1139/z06-142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Habitat modification ===
{{Main|Habitat destruction}}
[[Habitat]] modification or destruction is one of the most dramatic issues affecting amphibian species worldwide. As amphibians generally need aquatic and terrestrial habitats to survive, threats to either habitat can affect populations. Hence, amphibians may be more vulnerable to habitat modification than organisms that only require one habitat type. Large scale climate changes may further be modifying aquatic habitats, preventing amphibians from spawning altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7693381.stm | work=BBC News | title=Climate link to amphibian decline | date=2008-10-27 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Habitat fragmentation ===
{{Main|Habitat fragmentation}}
Habitat fragmentation occurs when habitats are isolated by habitat modification, such as when a small area of forest is completely surrounded by agricultural fields.  Small populations that survive within such fragments are often susceptible to [[inbreeding]], [[genetic drift]], or extinction due to small fluctuations in the environment.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

=== Pollution and chemical contaminants ===
There is evidence of chemical [[pollutant]]s causing frog developmental deformities (extra limbs, or malformed eyes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The complexity of deformed amphibians|author1=Blaustein, Andrew R|author2=Pieter TJ Johnson|journal=Front.

Some alter the [[central nervous system]]; others like [[atrazine]] cause a disruption in the production and secretion of hormones. Experimental studies have also shown that exposure to commonly used herbicides such as [[glyphosate]] (Tradename [[Roundup (herbicide)|Roundup]]) or insecticides such as [[malathion]] or [[carbaryl]] greatly increase mortality of tadpoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Relyea | first1 = R.A. | year = 2004 | title = The impact of insecticides and herbicides on the biodiversity and productivity of aquatic communities | url = | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 618–627 | doi=10.1890/03-5342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional studies have indicated that terrestrial adult stages of amphibians are also susceptible to non-active ingredients in Roundup, particularly [[Polyethoxylated tallow amine|POEA]], which is a [[surfactant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Relyea | first1 = R.A. | year = 2005 | title = The lethal impact of Roundup on aquatic and terrestrial amphibians | url = | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 1118–1124 | doi=10.1890/04-1291}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Atrazine has been shown to cause male tadpoles of African clawed frogs to become hermaphroditic with development of both male and female organs.

While most pesticide effects are likely to be local and restricted to areas near agriculture, there is evidence from the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains of the western United States that pesticides are traveling long distances into pristine areas, including [[Yosemite National Park]] in [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Grossi, Mark |title=Sierra Frogs Fall Silent|journal=The Fresno Bee|date=24 July 2001|url = http://www.yosemite.org/newsroom/clips2001/July/072401.html|accessdate=2008-10-02|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070618083908/http://www.yosemite.org/newsroom/clips2001/July/072401.html |archivedate = June 18, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ozone depletion, ultraviolet radiation and cloud cover ===

Salamanders and frogs that produce less [[photolyase]], an enzyme that counteracts DNA damage from UVB, are more susceptible to the effects of loss of the ozone layer. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation may not kill a particular species or life stage but may cause sublethal damage.

More than three dozen species of amphibians have been studied, with severe effects reported in more than 40 publications in peer-reviewed journals representing authors from North America, Europe and Australia. Experimental enclosure approaches to determine UVB effects on egg stages have been criticized; for example, egg masses were placed at water depths much shallower than is typical for natural oviposition sites.

These encysted life stages produce developmental abnormalities in post-metamorphic frogs, including additional or missing limbs.&lt;ref name="blaustein" /&gt;  These abnormalities increase frog predation by aquatic birds, the final host of the trematode.

A study showed that high levels of nutrients used in farming and ranching activities fuel parasite infections that have caused frog deformities in ponds and lakes across North America. The study showed increased levels of nitrogen and phosphorus cause sharp hikes in the abundance of trematodes, and that the parasites subsequently form cysts in the developing limbs of tadpoles causing missing limbs, extra limbs and other severe malformations including five or six extra or even no limbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aquatic eutrophication promotes pathogenic infection in amphibians|doi=10.1073/pnas.0707763104|year=2007|volume=104|issue=40  |pages=15781–15786|author1=Johnson PTJ |author2=Jonathan M.

==== Chytridiomycosis ====
[[File:Chytridiomycosis.jpg|thumb|left|A chytrid-infected frog]]
{{Main|Chytridiomycosis}}
In 1998, following large-scale frog deaths in Australia and Central America, research teams in both areas came up with identical results: a previously undescribed species of [[pathogenic]] fungus, ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]''.&lt;ref name="Lips"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lips|first=K.

The disease caused by ''Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis'' is called chytridiomycosis.  Frogs infected by this disease generally show skin lesions and [[hyperkeratosis]], and it is believed that death occurs because of interference with skin functions including maintenance of fluid balance, electrolyte [[homeostasis]], [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and role as a barrier to infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chytridiomycosis in Native Arizona Frogs|author1=Gregory A.

Subsequent research has established that the fungus has been present in Australia since at least 1978, and present in North America since at least the 1970s.  The first known record of chytrid infection in frogs is in the African Clawed Frog, ''[[Xenopus laevis]]''.
Because ''Xenopus'' are sold in pet shops and used in laboratories around the world, it is possible that the chytrid fungus may have been exported from Africa.&lt;ref name="Weldon et al 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weldon|first=Ché|author2=du Preez, Louis H. |author3=Hyatt, Alex D. |author4=Muller, Reinhold |author5=Speare, Rick |title=Origin of the Amphibian Chytrid Fungus|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|year=2004|volume=10|issue=12|pages=2100–2105|doi=10.3201/eid1012.030804|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/10/12/03-0804_article.htm|pmid=15663845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Introduced predators ===
{{Main|Introduced species}}
Non-native predators and competitors have also been found to affect the viability of frogs in their habitats.  The [[mountain yellow-legged frog]] which typically inhabits the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] lakes have seen a decline in numbers due to stocking of non-native fish ([[trout]]) for recreational [[fishing]].  The developing tadpoles and froglets fall prey to the fish in large numbers. This interference in the frog's three-year [[Metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]] is causing a decline that is manifest throughout their ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knapp | first1 = R. A. | last2 = Matthews | first2 = K.

=== Increased noise levels ===
Frogs and toads are highly vocal, and their reproductive behaviour often involves the use of vocalizations. There have been suggestions that increased noise levels caused by human activities may be contributing to their declines. In a study in Thailand, increased [[ambient noise level]]s were shown to decrease calling in some species and to cause an increase in others.&lt;ref name="Anthropogenic sounds"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sun|first=Jennifer W.C.|author2=Narins, Peter M.|title=Anthropogenic sounds differentially affect amphibian call rate|journal=Biological Conservation|year=2005|volume=121|issue=3|pages=419–427|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2004.05.017|url=https://www.ibp.ucla.edu/Faculty/Narins/publications/pdfs/Sun%20and%20Narins%20BC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has, however, not been shown to be a cause for the widespread decline.

== Symptoms of stressed populations ==
Amphibian populations in the beginning stages of decline often exude a number of signs, which may potentially be used to identify at-risk segments in conservation efforts.  One such sign is developmental instability, which has been proven as evidence of environmental stress.&lt;ref name=Alfordetal2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alford|first=Ross A.|author2=Bradfield, Kay S. |author3=Richards, Stephen J. |title=Ecology: Global warming and amphibian losses|journal=Nature|year=2007|volume=447|issue=7144|pages=E3–E4|doi=10.1038/nature05940|url=http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/16656/1/16656.pdf|pmid=17538571}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This environmental stress can potentially raise susceptibility to diseases such as chytridiomycosis, and thus lead to amphibian declines.  In a study conducted in [[Queensland]], Australia, for example, populations of two amphibian species, ''[[Litoria nannotis]]'' and ''[[Litoria genimaculata]]'', were found to exhibit far greater levels of limb asymmetry in pre-decline years than in control years, the latter of which preceded die offs by an average of 16 years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}  Learning to identify such signals in the critical period before population declines occur might greatly improve conservation efforts.

== Conservation measures ==
{{See also|Amphibian Ark}}
On 16 February 2007, scientists worldwide met in [[Atlanta]], [[United States|U.S.]], to form a group called the [[Amphibian Ark]] to help save more than 6,000 species of amphibians from disappearing by starting [[captive breeding]] programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=9&amp;art_id=38447&amp;sid=12249536&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20070216 | title = Bid to save frogs from killer goes worldwide | language =  | accessdate = 2007-02-22 | year = 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151018180029/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=9&amp;art_id=38447&amp;sid=12249536&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20070216 | archivedate = 2015-10-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation efforts have been created by several organizations such as Amphibian Conservation Alliance (ACA) and the World Wildlife Fund to help further studies on frog extinction and educate people on the issue at hand.

Areas with noticed frog extinctions, like Australia, have few policies that have been created to prevent the extinction of these species.  However, local initiatives have been placed where conscious efforts to decrease global warming will also turn into a conscious effort towards saving the frogs. In South America, where there is also an increased decline of amphibian populations, there is no set policy to try to save frogs. Some suggestions would include getting entire governments to place a set of rules and institutions as a source of guidelines that local governments have to abide by.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frogs.org/index.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219121411/http://www.frogs.org/index.asp |date=December 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverzoo.org/conservation/project46 ]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A critical issue is how to design protected areas for amphibians which will provide suitable conditions for their survival. Conservation efforts through the use of protected areas have shown to generally be a temporary solution to population decline and extinction because the amphibians become inbred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Amphibians, Reptiles, and their Conservation|last = Crump|first = M.|publisher = Linnet Books|year = 2002|isbn = |location = North Haven, CT|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is crucial for most amphibians to maintain a high level of genetic variation through large and more diverse environments.

Education of local people to protect amphibians is crucial, along with legislation for local protection and limiting the use of toxic chemicals, including some fertilizers and pesticides in sensitive amphibian areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The New Encyclopedia of Reptiles and Amphibians (2 ed.)|last = Halliday, Adler|publisher = Oxford University Pres|year = 2008|isbn = 9780198525073|location = Online|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminal defenses}}
In [[law]], the '''duty to retreat''' is a legal requirement in some jurisdictions that a threatened person cannot harm another in [[self-defense]] (especially lethal force) when it is possible to instead retreat to a place of safety.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;''Criminal Law - Cases and Materials'', 7th ed. 2012, [[Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business]]; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], [[Guyora Binder]], {{ISBN|978-1-4548-0698-1}}, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|549–554}} This requirement contrasts with right in some other jurisdictions to ''[[stand one's ground]]'', meaning being allowed to defend one's self instead of retreating.

It is a specific component which sometimes appears in the criminal defense of self-defense, and which must be addressed if criminal defendants are to prove that their conduct was [[excuse|justified]]. 

==U.S. law==
Some U.S. jurisdictions &lt;!-- rm which tag because the list is changing --&gt;  require that a person retreat from an attack, and allow the use of [[deadly force]] in self-defense only when retreat is not possible or when retreat poses a danger to the person under attack.&lt;ref&gt;''See'', ''e.g.'', ''[[State v. Abbott]]'', [https://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/supreme-court/1961/36-n-j-63-0.html 36 N.J. 63, 71-72 174 A.2d 881] (1961) ("[D]eadly force is not justifiable "if the actor knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating."); ''[[Commonwealth v. Eberle]]'', [https://law.justia.com/cases/pennsylvania/supreme-court/1977/474-pa-548-0.html 474 Pa. 548, 557-58, 379 A.2d 90] (1977) ("[T]he prosecution had a duty to establish that the appellant knew that she could avoid the necessity of using deadly force with complete safety by retreating... Because the prosecution has failed to show that the only escape route which appellant possibly could have used to avoid the confrontation could have been used without increasing the risk of injury to which she was already exposed, it has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant violated any duty to retreat.")&lt;/ref&gt; The duty to retreat is not universal, however.  For example, police officers are not required to retreat when acting in the line of duty.  

Other states apply what is known as the [[castle doctrine]], whereby a threatened person need not retreat within his or her own dwelling or place of work. Sometimes this has been the result of court rulings that one need not retreat in a place where one has an especial right to be.&lt;ref&gt;''State v. Allery'', 101 Wash. 2d 591, [https://law.justia.com/cases/washington/supreme-court/1984/49674-9-1.html 682 P.2d 312] (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; In other states, this has been accomplished by statute, such as that suggested by the [[Model Penal Code]]&lt;ref&gt;§ 3.04(2)(b)(ii)&lt;/ref&gt;.

Still other states have passed [[stand your ground law]]s that do not require an individual to retreat and allow one to match force for force, deadly force for deadly force. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-law-basics/states-that-have-stand-your-ground-laws.html|title=States That Have Stand Your Ground Laws - FindLaw|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most state legal systems began by importing [[English Common Law]] such as Acts of Parliament of 2 Ed. III ([[Statute of Northampton]]), and 5 Rich. II of 1381 ([[Forcible Entry Act 1381]])—which imposed criminal sanctions intending to discourage the resort to self-help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/CACourts/|title=''Dickinson v.

In ''[[Erwin v. State]]'' (1876), the [[Supreme Court of Ohio]] wrote that a "[[true man]]", one without fault, would not retreat.&lt;ref name=NDR&gt;No Duty to Retreat:Violence and Values in American History and Society 4030 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Runyan v. State]]'' (1877), the Indiana court rejected a duty to retreat, implying it was un-American,&lt;ref name="CL"/&gt;{{rp|551–2}} writing of a referring to the distinct [[American mind]],&lt;ref name=NDR/&gt; "the tendency of the American mind seems to be very strongly against" a duty to retreat.&lt;ref name=NDR/&gt; The court went further in saying that no statutory law could require a duty to retreat, because the right to stand one's ground is "founded on the law of nature; and is not, nor can be, superseded by any law of society."

==English law==
In [[English law]] the focus of the test is whether the defendant is acting reasonably in the particular situation. There is no specific requirement that a person must retreat in anticipation of an attack. Although some withdrawal would be useful evidence to prove that the defendant did not want to fight, not every defendant is able to escape. In ''R v Bird'' the defendant was physically attacked, and reacted instinctively and immediately without having the opportunity to retreat. Had there been a delay in the response, the reaction might have appeared more revenge than self-defense.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Bird'' (1985) 1 WLR 816&lt;/ref&gt;

As to carrying weapons in anticipation of an attack, ''Evans v Hughes'' held that for a defendant to justify his possession of a metal bar on a public highway, he had to show that there was an imminent particular threat affecting the particular circumstances in which the weapon was carried.&lt;ref&gt;''Evans v Hughes'' (1972) 3 A ER 412&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, in ''Taylor v Mucklow'' a building owner was held to be using an unreasonable degree of force in carrying a loaded airgun against a builder who was demolishing a new extension because his bills were unpaid.&lt;ref&gt;''Taylor v Mucklow'' (1973) CLR 750&lt;/ref&gt; More dramatically, in ''AG's Reference (No 2 of 1983)'' [[Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane|Lord Lane]] held that a defendant who manufactured ten petrol bombs to defend his shop during the [[1981 Toxteth riots|Toxteth riots]] could set up the defense of showing that he possessed an explosive substance "for a lawful purpose" if he could establish that he was acting in self-defense to protect himself or his family or property against an imminent and apprehended attack by means which he believed to be no more than reasonably necessary to meet the attack.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General's Reference (No 2 of 1983)'' (1984) 1 AER 988&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5582">'''EcoPark''' ({{zh|t=環保園}}) located in [[Tuen Mun]] Area 38, on west side of [[Hong Kong]], is similar to an [[industrial park]] exclusively for [[waste recycling]] and [[environmental engineering]].  This is the first of its kind in Hong Kong.

== Introduction ==
In December 2003, the [[Hong Kong Government]] mapped out a strategy on waste management emphasized waste reduction and recovery. Hong Kong currently recycles 48% of its [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW), but over 99% of recovered recyclable materials are exported to [[Mainland China]] for further re-processing while less than 1% are treated locally and re-manufactured into useful products. With the measures to promote waste recovery, recycling and reuse in place, a local waste management area like EcoPark is a viable option for furthering Hong Kong's recycling program.  

EcoPark aims to promote the local [[recycling|recycling industry]] and jump-start a circular economy to provide a sustainable solution to the city's waste problems. By encouraging and promoting the reuse, recovery and recycling of waste resources and returning them to the consumption loop, the EcoPark will help realize the full potential of the local recycling industry and alleviate the heavy reliance on the export of recyclable materials recovered from Hong Kong.

== Design and construction ==
The EcoPark occupies 200,000 square metres of land in Tuen Mun Area 38 and will be developed in two phases. As pledged in the Policy Framework, the aim is to commission Phase I of EcoPark (80,000 square metres) towards the end of 2006 and Phase II (120,000 square metres) in 2009. Hong Kong Government funding will be used to build the basic infrastructure of EcoPark.

The EcoPark will be divided into lots of different sizes. Lots in EcoPark will be tendered for specific recovered materials and processes that help achieve Hong Kong's government waste management objectives, in particular, in recycling local wastes. Admission criteria will be developed with priority given to processes involving value-added technologies, and target materials of the proposed Producer Responsibility Schemes. 

== Progress ==
All six lots in EcoPark Phase I has been allocated for recycling of waste cooking oil, waste computer equipment, waste metals, waste wood, waste plastics and waste car batteries.  Some of them are already in operation, while the rest of tenants will start their operation shortly.

Construction works of the EcoPark Phase II have already completed.  Two lots have been allocated to non-government organisations for recycling of plastics and waste electrical appliances.  The remaining lots in EcoPark Phase II will be available for tendering in late 2010.

== Phase II lots ==
Tendering of Phase II lots (with a total area of 100,000 square metres) will start in late 2010.  Further information on the tendering can be obtained from EcoPark management office.

== Visitor Centre ==
The 1,000-square metre EcoPark Visitor Centre is the first education centre in Hong Kong with a main theme of solid waste management.  Admission is free and docent service will be provided.  Online and telephone booking can be arranged through the EcoPark Management Office. 

== Public consultation ==
Hong Kong Government has consulted the [[Tuen Mun District|Tuen Mun District Council]] and members support the development of EcoPark and agree that EcoPark will help promote development of local recycling industry and create job opportunities in Tuen Mun. The Council hopes that EcoPark will become a landmark for Tuen Mun.

Local trade associations and recyclers were also consulted and they support the development of EcoPark, agreeing that by providing long-term land at affordable cost, together with supporting infrastructure, EcoPark will help enhance recycling technology development and improve waste recovery rates in Hong Kong.

== Environmental considerations ==
An [[Environmental Impact Assessment]] (EIA) was carried out in respect of air and water quality, waste management, land contamination, [[landfill gas]] hazard and hazard to life, in which a wide range of recycling processes for different material types were examined. The assessment recommends a list of materials and processes to be allowed and also recommends a number of mitigation measures. With these measures in place, the EIA concludes that there will be no significant environmental impacts to the surrounding areas.

{{Sustainable energy}}

'''Efficient energy use''', sometimes simply called '''energy efficiency''', is the goal to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services. For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. Installing [[LED lamp|LED lighting]], [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lighting]], or natural [[skylight|skylight windows]] reduces the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination compared to using traditional [[incandescent light bulb]]s. Improvements in energy efficiency are generally achieved by adopting a more efficient technology or production process&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Diesendorf|Diesendorf, Mark]] (2007). ''[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]'', UNSW Press, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; or by application of commonly accepted methods to reduce energy losses.

There are many motivations to improve energy efficiency. Reducing energy use reduces energy costs and may result in a financial cost saving to consumers if the energy savings offset any additional costs of implementing an energy-efficient technology. Reducing energy use is also seen as a solution to the problem of reducing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. According to the [[International Energy Agency]], improved energy efficiency in [[energy-efficient buildings|buildings]], industrial processes and [[sustainable transportation|transportation]] could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sophie Hebden |url=http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&amp;itemid=2929&amp;language=1 |title=Invest in clean technology says IEA report |publisher=Scidev.net |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important solution is to remove government-led energy subsidies that promote high energy consumption and inefficient energy use in more than half of the countries in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Indra Overland (2010) ‘Subsidies for Fossil Fuels and Climate Change: A Comparative Perspective’, International Journal of Environmental Studies, Vol. 67, No. 3, pp. 203-217.
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240515305&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy efficiency and [[renewable energy]] are said to be the ''twin pillars'' of [[sustainable energy]] policy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Prindle |first1= Bill |last2= Eldridge |first2= Maggie |last3= Eckhardt |first3= Mike |last4= Frederick |first4= Alyssa |title= The twin pillars of sustainable energy: synergies between energy efficiency and renewable energy technology and policy |date= May 2007 |publisher= American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) |place= Washington, DC, USA |url= http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.545.4606&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |access-date= 2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are high priorities in the sustainable [[energy hierarchy]]. In many countries energy efficiency is also seen to have a national security benefit because it can be used to reduce the level of energy imports from foreign countries and may slow down the rate of energy at which domestic energy resources are depleted.

==Overview==
{{Further|Domestic energy consumption}}
Energy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily increasing [[energy consumption]]. For example, the state of [[California]] began implementing energy-efficiency measures in the mid-1970s, including building code and appliance standards with strict efficiency requirements. During the following years, California's energy consumption has remained approximately flat on a per capita basis while national US consumption doubled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=UNP|location=London|pages=180–181|url=http://greenillusions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its strategy, California implemented a "loading order" for new energy resources that puts energy efficiency first, renewable electricity supplies second, and new fossil-fired power plants last.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-043/CEC-400-2005-043.PDF |title=Loading Order White Paper |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; States such as Connecticut and New York have created quasi-public [[Green bank (financial institution)|Green Banks]] to help residential and commercial building-owners finance energy efficiency upgrades that reduce emissions and cut consumers' energy costs.&lt;ref&gt;Kennan, Hallie. "Working Paper: State Green Banks for Clean Energy" http://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/WorkingPaper_StateGreenBanks.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovin's [[Rocky Mountain Institute]] points out that in industrial settings, "there are abundant opportunities to save 70% to 90% of the energy and cost for lighting, fan, and pump systems; 50% for electric motors; and 60% in areas such as heating, cooling, office equipment, and appliances." In general, up to 75% of the electricity used in the US today could be saved with efficiency measures that cost less than the electricity itself, the same holds true for home settings. The US Department of Energy has stated that there is potential for energy saving in the magnitude of 90 Billion kWh by increasing home energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencollaroperations.com/weatherization-austin-tx.html |title=Weatherization in Austin, Texas |publisher=Green Collar Operations |accessdate=2010-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803235602/http://www.greencollaroperations.com/weatherization-austin-tx.html |archivedate=2009-08-03 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have emphasized this. A report published in 2006 by the [[McKinsey Global Institute]], asserted that "there are sufficient economically viable opportunities for energy-productivity improvements that could keep global energy-demand growth at less than 1 percent per annum"—less than half of the 2.2 percent average growth anticipated through 2020 in a business-as-usual scenario.&lt;ref name= NYT292006&gt;{{cite news|title= Energy Use Can Be Cut by Efficiency, Survey Says.... |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/29/business/29energy.html |accessdate= November 29, 2006|newspaper=The New York Times |date= November 29, 2006|author= Steve Lohr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy productivity, which measures the output and quality of goods and services per unit of energy input, can come from either reducing the amount of energy required to produce something, or from increasing the quantity or quality of goods and services from the same amount of energy.

The [[Vienna Climate Change Talks 2007]] Report, under the auspices of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), clearly shows "that energy efficiency can achieve real emission reductions at low cost."&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/files/press/news_room/press_releases_and_advisories/application/pdf/20070831_vienna_closing_press_release.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[International standard]]s ISO{{nbsp}}17743 and ISO{{nbsp}}17742 provide a documented methodology for calculating and reporting on energy savings and energy efficiency for countries and cities.&lt;ref name="iso-17743"&gt;

==Appliances==
{{See also|green computing|solar lamp|energy saving lamp|power usage effectiveness}}

Modern appliances, such as, [[freezers]], [[oven]]s, [[stove]]s, [[dishwasher]]s, and clothes washers and dryers, use significantly less energy than older appliances. Installing a clothesline will significantly reduce one's energy consumption as their dryer will be used less. Current energy-efficient refrigerators, for example, use 40 percent less energy than conventional models did in 2001. Following this, if all households in Europe changed their more than ten-year-old appliances into new ones, 20 billion kWh of electricity would be saved annually, hence reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by almost 18 billion kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecosavings.electrolux.com/#int_en |title=Ecosavings |publisher=Electrolux.com |accessdate=2010-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806070945/http://ecosavings.electrolux.com/#int_en |archivedate=2011-08-06 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the corresponding figures would be 17 billion kWh of electricity and {{convert|27000000000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electrolux.com/ecosavings_us |title=Ecosavings (Tm) Calculator |publisher=Electrolux.com |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2009 study from [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] the replacement of old appliances is one of the most efficient global measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=McKinsey Global Institute|title=Pathways to a Low-Carbon Economy: Version 2 of the Global Greenhouse Gas Abatement Cost Curve|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/dotcom/client_service/sustainability/cost%20curve%20pdfs/pathways_lowcarbon_economy_version2.ashx|accessdate=February 16, 2016|page=7|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern power management systems also reduce energy usage by idle appliances by turning them off or putting them into a low-energy mode after a certain time. Many countries identify energy-efficient appliances using [[energy input labeling]].&lt;ref name=app&gt;{{cite web|author=Environmental and Energy Study Institute |url=http://www.eesi.org/buildings_efficiency_0506 |title=Energy-Efficient Buildings: Using whole building design to reduce energy consumption in homes and offices |publisher=Eesi.org |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of energy efficiency on peak demand depends on when the appliance is used. For example, an air conditioner uses more energy during the afternoon when it is hot. Therefore, an energy-efficient air conditioner will have a larger impact on peak demand than off-peak demand. An energy-efficient dishwasher, on the other hand, uses more energy during the late evening when people do their dishes. This appliance may have little to no impact on peak demand.

==Building design==

Buildings are an important field for energy efficiency improvements around the world because of their role as a major energy consumer. However, the question of energy use in buildings is not straightforward as the indoor conditions that can be achieved with energy use vary a lot. The measures that keep buildings comfortable, lighting, heating, cooling and ventilation, all consume energy. Typically the level of energy efficiency in a building is measured by dividing energy consumed with the floor area of the building which is referred to as specific energy consumption (SEC) or energy use intensity (EUI)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=buildingcontest.eui]&lt;/ref&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac \text{Energy consumed}\text{Built area}&lt;/math&gt;

However, the issue is more complex as building materials have [[embodied energy]] in them. On the other hand, energy can be recovered from the materials when the building is dismantled by reusing materials or burning them for energy. Moreover, when the building is used, the indoor conditions can vary resulting in higher and lower quality indoor environments. Finally, overall efficiency is affected by the use of the building: is the building occupied most of the time and are spaces efficiently used — or is the building largely empty? It has even been suggested that for a more complete accounting of energy efficiency, SEC should be amended to include these factors:&lt;ref&gt;Juha Forsström, Pekka Lahti, Esa Pursiheimo, Miika Rämä, Jari Shemeikka, Kari Sipilä, Pekka Tuominen &amp; Irmeli Wahlgren (2011): [http://www.vtt.fi/inf/pdf/tiedotteet/2011/T2581.pdf Measuring energy efficiency]. VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\text{Embodied energy} + \text{Energy consumed} - \text{Energy recovered}}{\text{Built area} \times \text{Utilization rate} \times \text{Quality factor}}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus a balanced approach to energy efficiency in buildings should be more comprehensive than simply trying to minimize energy consumed. Issues such as quality of indoor environment and efficiency of space use should be factored in. Thus the measures used to improve energy efficiency can take many different forms. Often they include passive measures that inherently reduce the need to use energy, such as better insulation. Many serve various functions improving the indoor conditions as well as reducing energy use, such as increased use of natural light.

A building's location and surroundings play a key role in regulating its temperature and illumination. For example, trees, landscaping, and hills can provide shade and block wind. In cooler climates, designing northern hemisphere buildings with south facing windows and southern hemisphere buildings with north facing windows increases the amount of sun (ultimately heat energy) entering the building, minimizing energy use, by maximizing [[passive solar heating]]. Tight building design, including energy-efficient windows, well-sealed doors, and additional thermal insulation of walls, basement slabs, and foundations can reduce heat loss by 25 to 50 percent.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Most heat is lost through the walls of your building, in fact about a third of all heat losses occur in this area. [https://www.simplybusinessenergy.co.uk/news/electricity-and-energy-cost-savings-for-small-businesses~188/ Simply Business Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dark roofs may become up to 39&amp;nbsp;°C (70&amp;nbsp;°F) hotter than the most [[reflective surfaces (climate engineering)|reflective white surfaces]]. They transmit some of this additional heat inside the building. US Studies have shown that lightly colored roofs use 40 percent less energy for cooling than buildings with darker roofs. White roof systems save more energy in sunnier climates. Advanced electronic heating and cooling systems can moderate energy consumption and improve the comfort of people in the building.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;

Proper placement of windows and skylights as well as the use of architectural features that reflect light into a building can reduce the need for artificial lighting. Increased use of natural and task lighting has been shown by one study to increase productivity in schools and offices.&lt;ref name=app/&gt; [[Compact fluorescent lamp]]s use two-thirds less energy and may last 6 to 10 times longer than [[incandescent light bulb]]s. Newer fluorescent lights produce a natural light, and in most applications they are cost effective, despite their higher initial cost, with payback periods as low as a few months. [[LED lamp]]s use only about 10% of the energy an incandescent lamp requires.

Effective energy-efficient building design can include the use of low cost Passive Infra Reds (PIRs) to switch-off lighting when areas are unnoccupied such as toilets, corridors or even office areas out-of-hours. In addition, lux levels can be monitored using daylight sensors linked to the building's lighting scheme to switch on/off or dim the lighting to pre-defined levels to take into account the natural light and thus reduce consumption. Building Management Systems (BMS) link all of this together in one centralised computer to control the whole building's lighting and power requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Creating Energy Efficient Offices - Electrical Contractor Fit-out Article&lt;/ref&gt;

In an analysis that integrates a residential bottom-up simulation with an economic multi-sector model, it has been shown that variable heat gains caused by insulation and air-conditioning efficiency can have load-shifting effects that are not uniform on the electricity load. The study also highlighted the impact of higher household efficiency on the power generation capacity choices that are made by the power sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12053-015-9392-9 |title=Beyond the end-consumer: how would improvements in residential energy efficiency affect the power sector in Saudi Arabia? |year=2015 |last1=Matar |first1=W |journal=Energy Efficiency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of which space heating or cooling technology to use in buildings can have a significant impact on energy use and efficiency. For example, replacing an older 50% efficient [[furnace#Household furnaces|natural gas furnace]] with a new 95% efficient one will dramatically reduce energy use, carbon emissions, and winter natural gas bills. [[Ground source heat pump]]s can be even more energy-efficient and cost-effective. These systems use pumps and compressors to move refrigerant fluid around a thermodynamic cycle in order to "pump" heat against its natural flow from hot to cold, for the purpose of transferring heat into a building from the large thermal reservoir contained within the nearby ground. The end result is that heat pumps typically use four times less electrical energy to deliver an equivalent amount of heat than a direct electrical heater does. Another advantage of a ground source heat pump is that it can be reversed in summertime and operate to cool the air by transferring heat from the building to the ground. The disadvantage of ground source heat pumps is their high initial capital cost, but this is typically recouped within five to ten years as a result of lower energy use.

[[Smart meter]]s are slowly being adopted by the commercial sector to highlight to staff and for internal monitoring purposes the building's energy usage in a dynamic presentable format. The use of Power Quality Analysers can be introduced into an existing building to assess usage, harmonic distortion, peaks, swells and interruptions amongst others to ultimately make the building more energy-efficient. Often such meters communicate by using [[wireless sensor network]]s.

[[Green Building XML]] (gbXML) is an emerging schema, a subset of the [[Building Information Modeling]] efforts, focused on green building design and operation. gbXML is used as input in several energy simulation engines. But with the development of modern computer technology, a large number of [[building performance simulation]] tools are available on the market. When choosing which simulation tool to use in a project, the user must consider the tool's accuracy and reliability, considering the building information they have at hand, which will serve as input for the tool. Yezioro, Dong and Leite&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2007.04.014 |title=An applied artificial intelligence approach towards assessing building performance simulation tools |year=2008 |last1=Yezioro |first1=A |last2=Dong |first2=B |last3=Leite |first3=F |journal=Energy and Buildings |volume=40 |issue=4 |page=612}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed an artificial intelligence approach towards assessing building performance simulation results and found that more detailed simulation tools have the best simulation performance in terms of heating and cooling electricity consumption within 3% of mean absolute error.

[[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) is a rating system organized by the [[US Green Building Council]] (USGBC) to promote environmental responsibility in building design. They currently offer four levels of certification for existing buildings (LEED-EBOM) and new construction (LEED-NC) based on a building's compliance with the following criteria: [[Sustainable sites]], [[water efficiency]], energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, and innovation in design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LEED v4 for Building Design and Construction Checklist |url=http://www.usgbc.org/sites/default/files/LEED%20v4%20for%20Building%20Design%20and%20Construction%20_1%20PAGE_0.xlsx |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20150226000022/http://www.usgbc.org/sites/default/files/LEED%20v4%20for%20Building%20Design%20and%20Construction%20_1%20PAGE_0.xlsx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 February 2015 |website=USGBC |accessdate=29 April 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, USGBC developed the LEED Dynamic Plaque, a tool to track building performance against LEED metrics and a potential path to recertification. The following year, the council collaborated with [[Honeywell]] to pull data on energy and water use, as well as indoor air quality from a BAS to automatically update the plaque, providing a near-real-time view of performance. The USGBC office in [[Washington, D.C.]] is one of the first buildings to feature the live-updating LEED Dynamic Plaque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honeywell, USGBC Tool Monitors Building Sustainability|url=http://www.environmentalleader.com/2014/10/22/honeywell-usgbc-tool-monitors-building-sustainability/|website=Environmental Leader|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[deep energy retrofit]] is a whole-building analysis and construction process that uses to achieve much larger energy savings than conventional [[green retrofit|energy retrofits]]. Deep energy retrofits can be applied to both residential and non-residential (“commercial”) buildings. A deep energy retrofit typically results in energy savings of 30 percent or more, perhaps spread over several years, and may significantly improve the building value.&lt;ref&gt;http://jeancarassus.zumablog.com/images/2128_uploads/Fuerst_New_paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Empire State Building]] has undergone a deep energy retrofit process that was completed in 2013. The project team, consisting of representatives from [[Johnson Controls]], [[Rocky Mountain Institute]], [[Clinton Climate Initiative]], and [[Jones Lang LaSalle]] will have achieved an annual energy use reduction of 38% and $4.4 million.&lt;ref name=ESB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esbnyc.com/sustainability_energy_efficiency.asp |title=Visit &gt; Sustainability &amp; Energy Efficiency &amp;#124; Empire State Building |publisher=Esbnyc.com |date=2011-06-16 |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the 6,500 windows were remanufactured onsite into [[superwindow]]s which block heat but pass light. [[Air conditioning]] operating costs on hot days were reduced and this saved $17 million of the project's capital cost immediately, partly funding other retrofitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137246/amory-b-lovins/a-farewell-to-fossil-fuels |title=A Farewell to Fossil Fuels |author=Amory Lovins |date=March–April 2012 |work=Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Receiving a gold [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)]] rating in September 2011, the Empire State Building is the tallest LEED certified building in the United States.&lt;ref name="inhabitat1"/&gt;
The [[Indianapolis City-County Building]] recently underwent a deep energy retrofit process, which has achieved an annual energy reduction of 46% and $750,000 annual energy saving.

Energy retrofits, including deep, and other types undertaken in residential, commercial or industrial locations are generally supported through various forms of financing or incentives. Incentives include pre-packaged rebates where the buyer/user may not even be aware that the item being used has been rebated or "bought down". "Upstream" or "Midstream" buy downs are common for efficient lighting products. Other rebates are more explicit and transparent to the end user through the use of formal applications. In addition to rebates, which may be offered through government or utility programs, governments sometimes offer tax incentives for energy efficiency projects. Some entities offer rebate and payment guidance and facilitation services that enable energy end use customers tap into rebate and incentive programs.

To evaluate the economic soundness of energy efficiency investments in buildings, [[cost-effectiveness analysis]] or CEA can be used. A CEA calculation will produce the value of energy saved, sometimes called ''[[negawatt]]s'', in $/kWh. The energy in such a calculation is virtual in the sense that it was never consumed but rather saved due to some energy efficiency investment being made. Thus CEA allows comparing the price of negawatts with price of energy such as electricity from the grid or the cheapest renewable alternative. The benefit of the CEA approach in energy systems is that it avoids the need to guess future energy prices for the purposes of the calculation, thus removing the major source of uncertainty in the appraisal of energy efficiency investments.&lt;ref&gt;Pekka Tuominen, Francesco Reda, Waled Dawoud, Bahaa Elboshy, Ghada Elshafei, Abdelazim Negm: [http://doi.org/10.1016/S2212-5671(15)00195-1 Economic Appraisal of Energy Efficiency in Buildings Using Cost-effectiveness Assessment].

==Energy efficiency by country==

===Europe===
{{See also|Energy efficiency in Europe (study)}}
{{Expand section|proper text and additional citations|date=June 2016}}

Energy efficiency targets for 2020 and 2030.

The first EU-wide target was set in 1998. Member states agreed to improve energy efficiency by 1 percent a year over twelve years. In addition, legislation about products, industry, transport and buildings has contributed to a general energy efficiency framework. More effort is needed to address heating and cooling: there is more heat wasted during electricity production in Europe than is required to heat all buildings in the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heatroadmap.eu/|title=Heat Roadmap Europe|website=www.heatroadmap.eu|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; All in all, EU energy efficiency legislation is estimated to deliver savings worth the equivalent of up to 326 million tons of oil per year by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boell.de/en/2018/04/24/energy-atlas-2018-figures-and-facts-about-renewables-europe?dimension1=ds_energyatlas|title=Energy Atlas 2018: Figures and Facts about Renewables in Europe {{!}} Heinrich Böll Foundation|work=Heinrich Böll Foundation|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU set itself a [[EU Energy Efficiency Directive 2012|20% energy savings target]] by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, but member states decide individually how energy savings will be achieved. At an EU summit in October 2014, EU countries agreed on a new energy efficiency target of 27% or greater by 2030. One mechanism used to achieve the target of 27% is the 'Suppliers Obligations &amp; White Certificates'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suppliers Obligations &amp; White Certificates|url=http://iet.jrc.ec.europa.eu/energyefficiency/white-certificates|website=Europa.EU|publisher=Europa.eu|accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ongoing debate around the 2016 Clean Energy Package also puts an emphasis on energy efficiency, but the goal will probably remain around 30% greater efficiency compared to 1990 levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boell.de/en/2018/04/24/energy-atlas-2018-figures-and-facts-about-renewables-europe?dimension1=ds_energyatlas|title=Energy Atlas 2018: Figures and Facts about Renewables in Europe {{!}} Heinrich Böll Foundation|work=Heinrich Böll Foundation|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that this will not be enough for the EU to meet its Paris Agreement goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% compared to 1990 levels.

===Australia===
The [[Australian national government]] is actively leading the country in efforts to increase their energy efficiency, mainly through the government's [[Department of Industry and Science]]. In July 2009, the [[Council of Australian Governments]], which represents the individual states and territories of Australia, agreed to a National Strategy on Energy Efficiency (NSEE).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=National Strategy on Energy Efficiency |publisher=Industry.gov.au |date=16 August 2015 |url=http://industry.gov.au/Energy/EnergyEfficiency/Pages/NationalStrategyEnergyEfficiency.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913191712/http://www.industry.gov.au/Energy/EnergyEfficiency/Pages/NationalStrategyEnergyEfficiency.aspx |archivedate=13 September 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a ten-year plan accelerate the implementation of a nationwide adoption of energy-efficient practices and a preparation for the country's transformation into a [[low carbon]] future. There are several different areas of energy use addressed within the NSEE. But, the chapter devoted to the approach on energy efficiency that is to be adopted on a national level stresses four points in achieving stated levels of energy efficiency. They are:
*To help households and businesses transition to a low carbon future
*To streamline the adoption of efficient energy
*To make buildings more energy-efficient
*For governments to work in partnership and lead the way to energy efficiency

The overriding agreement that governs this strategy is the National Partnership Agreement on Energy Efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=National Partnership Agreement on Energy Efficiency |publisher=Fif.gov.au |date=16 August 2015 |url=http://www.federalfinancialrelations.gov.au/content/npa/environment/energy_efficiency/national_partnership.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312005515/http://federalfinancialrelations.gov.au/content/npa/environment/energy_efficiency/national_partnership.pdf |archivedate=2015-03-12 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This document also explains the role of both the [[commonwealth]] and the individual states and territories in the NSEE, as well provides for the creation of benchmarks and measurement devices which will transparently show the nation's progress in relation to the stated goals, and addresses the need for funding of the strategy in order to enable it to move forward.

===Canada===

In August 2017, the Government of Canada released [https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/emmc/pdf/Building_Smart_en.pdf Build Smart - Canada's Buildings Strategy], as a key driver of the [https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/pan-canadian-framework.html Pan Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change], Canada's national climate strategy.

The Build Smart strategy seeks to dramatically increase the energy-efficiency performance of existing and new Canadian buildings, and establishes five goals to that end:
*Federal, provincial, and territorial governments will work to develop and adopt increasingly stringent model building codes, starting in 2020, with the goal that provinces and territories adopt a “net-zero energy ready” model building code by 2030.
*Federal, provincial, and territorial governments will work to develop a model code for existing buildings by 2022, with the goal that provinces and territories adopt the code.
*Federal, provincial, and territorial governments will work together with the aim of requiring labelling of building energy use by as early as 2019.
*The federal government will set new standards for heating equipment and other key technologies to the highest level of efficiency that is economically and technically achievable.
*Provincial and territorial governments will work to sustain and expand efforts to retrofit existing buildings by supporting energy efficiency improvements and by accelerating the adoption of high-efficiency equipment while tailoring their programs to regional circumstances.

The strategy details a range of activities the Government of Canada will pursue, and investments it will make, in support of the goals. As of early 2018, only one of Canada's 10 provinces and three territories, British Columbia, has developed a policy in support of federal government's goal to reach net zero energy ready ambitions: the [[BC Energy Step Code]].

Local British Columbia governments may use the BC Energy Step Code, if they wish, to incentivize or require a level of energy efficiency in new construction that goes above and beyond the requirements of the base building code. The regulation and standard is designed as a technical roadmap to help the province reach its target that all new buildings will attain a net zero energy ready level of performance by 2032.

Efforts to reduce final energy consumption in transport sector have not been successful, with a growth of 1.7% between 2005–2014. This growth is due to both road passenger and road freight transport. Both sectors increased their overall distance travelled to record the highest figures ever for Germany. Rebound effects played a significant role, both between improved vehicle efficiency and the distance travelled, and between improved vehicle efficiency and an increase in vehicle weights and engine power.&lt;ref name="loeschel-etal-2015"&gt;

The areas covered are the energy efficiency of buildings, energy conservation for companies, consumer energy efficiency, and transport energy efficiency. The policy contains both immediate and forward-looking measures. The central short-term measures of NAPE include the introduction of competitive tendering for energy efficiency, the raising of funding for building renovation, the introduction of tax incentives for efficiency measures in the building sector, and the setting up energy efficiency networks together with business and industry. German industry is expected to make a sizeable contribution.

A 2011 [[Energy Modeling Forum]] study covering the United States examines how energy efficiency opportunities will shape future fuel and electricity demand over the next several decades. The US economy is already set to lower its energy and carbon intensity, but explicit policies will be necessary to meet climate goals. These policies include: a carbon tax, mandated standards for more efficient appliances, buildings and vehicles, and subsidies or reductions in the upfront costs of new more energy-efficient equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Industry==
Industries use a large amount of energy to power a diverse range of manufacturing and resource extraction processes. Many industrial processes require large amounts of heat and mechanical power, most of which is delivered as [[natural gas]], [[petroleum|petroleum fuels]], and [[electricity]]. In addition some industries generate fuel from waste products that can be used to provide additional energy.

Because industrial processes are so diverse it is impossible to describe the multitude of possible opportunities for energy efficiency in industry. Many depend on the specific technologies and processes in use at each industrial facility. There are, however, a number of processes and energy services that are widely used in many industries.

Various industries generate [[steam]] and electricity for subsequent use within their facilities. When electricity is generated, the heat that is produced as a by-product can be captured and used for process steam, heating or other industrial purposes. Conventional electricity generation is about 30% efficient, whereas combined heat and power (also called [[co-generation]]) converts up to 90 percent of the fuel into usable energy.&lt;ref name=indust&gt;{{cite web|author=Environmental and Energy Study Institute |url=http://ladoma.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Energy-Efficiency-Fact-Sheet.pdf |title=Industrial Energy Efficiency: Using new technologies to reduce energy use in industry and manufacturing |accessdate=2015-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced boilers and furnaces can operate at higher temperatures while burning less fuel. These technologies are more efficient and produce fewer pollutants.&lt;ref name=indust/&gt;

Over 45 percent of the fuel used by US manufacturers is burnt to make steam. The typical industrial facility can reduce this energy usage 20 percent (according to the [[US Department of Energy]]) by insulating steam and condensate return lines, stopping steam leakage, and maintaining steam traps.&lt;ref name=indust/&gt;

[[Electric motor]]s usually run at a constant speed, but a [[variable speed drives|variable speed drive]] allows the motor's energy output to match the required load. This achieves energy savings ranging from 3 to 60 percent, depending on how the motor is used. Motor coils made of [[superconducting]] materials can also reduce energy losses.&lt;ref name=indust/&gt; Motors may also benefit from [[voltage optimisation]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Industry uses a large number of [[pumps]] and [[compressors]] of all shapes and sizes and in a wide variety of applications. The efficiency of pumps and compressors depends on many factors but often improvements can be made by implementing better [[process control]] and better maintenance practices. Compressors are commonly used to provide [[compressed air]] which is used for sand blasting, painting, and other power tools. According to the US Department of Energy, optimizing compressed air systems by installing variable speed drives, along with preventive maintenance to detect and fix air leaks, can improve energy efficiency 20 to 50 percent.&lt;ref name=indust/&gt;

Dorf, ''The Energy Factbook'', McGraw-Hill, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; There are several ways to enhance a vehicle's energy efficiency. Using improved [[aerodynamics]] to minimize drag can increase vehicle [[fuel efficiency]]. Reducing vehicle weight can also improve fuel economy, which is why [[composite materials]] are widely used in car bodies.

More advanced tires, with decreased tire to road friction and rolling resistance, can save gasoline. Fuel economy can be improved by up to 3.3% by keeping tires inflated to the correct pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/maintain.shtml |title=Tips to improve your Gas Mileage |publisher=Fueleconomy.gov |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Replacing a clogged air filter can improve a cars fuel consumption by as much as 10 percent on older vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eesi.org/files/auto_efficiency_0506.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; On newer vehicles (1980s and up) with fuel-injected, computer-controlled engines, a clogged air filter has no effect on mpg but replacing it may improve acceleration by 6-11 percent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/pdfs/Air_Filter_Effects_02_26_2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Aerodynamics also aid in efficiency of a vehicle. The design of a car impacts the amount of gas needed to move it through air. Aerodynamics involves the air around the car, which can affect the efficiency of the energy expended. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.carsdirect.com/car-buying/what-makes-a-car-fuel-efficient|title=What Makes a Fuel Efficient Car? The 8 Most Fuel Efficient Cars|work=CarsDirect|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turbocharger]]s can increase fuel efficiency by allowing a smaller displacement engine. The 'Engine of the year 2011' is a Fiat 500 engine equipped with an MHI turbocharger. "Compared with a 1.2-liter 8v engine, the new 85 HP turbo has 23% more power and a 30% better performance index. The performance of the two-cylinder is not only equivalent to a 1.4-liter 16v engine, but fuel consumption is 30% lower."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fiat 875cc TwinAir named International Engine of the Year 2011|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/05/fiat-20110520.html|website=Green Car Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy-efficient vehicles may reach twice the fuel efficiency of the average automobile. Cutting-edge designs, such as the diesel [[Mercedes-Benz Bionic]] concept vehicle have achieved a fuel efficiency as high as {{convert|84|mpgus}}, four times the current conventional automotive average.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eesi.org/files/auto_efficiency_0506.pd{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mainstream trend in automotive efficiency is the rise of [[electric vehicle]]s (all@electric or hybrid electric). Hybrids, like the [[Toyota Prius]], use [[regenerative braking]] to recapture energy that would dissipate in normal cars; the effect is especially pronounced in city driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nom * |url=https://www.lenergieenquestions.fr/prius-toyota-modele-reference-voitures-hybrides/ |title=La Prius de Toyota, une référence des voitures hybrides &amp;#124; L'énergie en questions |publisher=Lenergieenquestions.fr |date=2013-06-28 |accessdate=2013-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017080726/https://www.lenergieenquestions.fr/prius-toyota-modele-reference-voitures-hybrides/ |archivedate=2013-10-17 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plug-in hybrid]]s also have increased battery capacity, which makes it possible to drive for limited distances without burning any gasoline; in this case, energy efficiency is dictated by whatever process (such as coal-burning, hydroelectric, or renewable source) created the power. Plug-ins can typically drive for around {{convert|40|mi}} purely on electricity without recharging; if the battery runs low, a gas engine kicks in allowing for extended range. Finally, all-electric cars are also growing in popularity; the [[Tesla Model S]] sedan is the only high-performance all-electric car currently on the market.

===Street lighting===
Cities around the globe light up millions of streets with 300 million lights.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/2763639/global_led_and_smart_street_lighting_market&lt;/ref&gt; Some cities are seeking to reduce [[street light]] power consumption by dimming lights during off-peak hours or switching to LED lamps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edmonton.ca/transportation/on_your_streets/street-lighting.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether the high luminous efficiency of LEDs will lead to real reductions in energy, as cities may end up installing extra lamps or lighting areas more brightly than in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyba|first1=C. C. M.|last2=Hänel|first2=A.|last3=Hölker|first3=F.|title=Redefining efficiency for outdoor lighting|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|date=2014|volume=7|issue=6|pages=1806|doi=10.1039/C4EE00566J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aircraft===
{{Main|Fuel economy in aircraft|Environmental impact of aviation}}

There are several ways to reduce energy usage in air transportation, from modifications to the planes themselves, to how air traffic is managed. As in cars, turbochargers are an effective way to reduce energy consumption; however, instead of allowing for the use of a smaller-displacement engine, turbochargers in jet turbines operate by compressing the thinner air at higher altitudes. This allows the engine to operate as if it were at sea-level pressures while taking advantage of the reduced drag on the aircraft at higher altitudes.

Air traffic management systems are another way to increase the efficiency of not just the aircraft but the airline industry as a whole. New technology allows for superior automation of takeoff, landing, and collision avoidance, as well as within airports, from simple things like HVAC and lighting to more complex tasks such as security and scanning.

==Energy conservation==
{{Main|Energy conservation}}
[[File:Illust passive solar d1.gif|thumb|250px|right|Elements of [[Passive solar building design|passive solar energy design]], shown in a direct gain application]]

[[Energy conservation]] is broader than energy efficiency in including active efforts to decrease energy consumption, for example through [[behavior change (public health)|behaviour change]], in addition to using energy more efficiently. Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements are heating a room less in winter, using the car less, air-drying your clothes instead of using the dryer, or enabling energy saving modes on a computer. As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms.&lt;ref&gt;Dietz, T. et al. (2009).[http://www.pnas.org/content/106/44/18452.full Household actions can provide a behavioral wedge to rapidly reduce US carbon emissions]. PNAS. 106(44).&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of [[fossil fuels]].&lt;ref&gt;Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Energy conservation is a challenge requiring policy programmes, technological development and behavior change to go hand in hand. Many energy [[intermediary]] organisations, for example governmental or non-governmental organisations on local, regional, or national level, are working on often publicly funded programmes or projects to meet this challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Breukers, Heiskanen, et al. (2009). Interaction schemes for successful demand-side management. Deliverable 5 of the [http://www.energychange.info/index.php CHANGING BEHAVIOUR] project. Funded by the EC (#213217).&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists have also engaged with the issue of energy conservation and have provided guidelines for realizing behavior change to reduce energy consumption while taking technological and policy considerations into account.&lt;ref&gt;Kok, G., Lo, S.H., Peters, G.J. &amp; R.A.C. Ruiter (2011), Changing Energy-Related Behavior: An Intervention Mapping Approach, Energy Policy, 39:9, 5280-5286, doi:10.1016/j.enpol.2011.05.036&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory maintains a comprehensive list of apps useful for energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.openei.org/apps/ |title=National Renewable Energy Laboratory. (2012) |publisher=En.openei.org |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial property managers that plan and manage energy efficiency projects generally use a software platform to perform energy audits and to collaborate with contractors to understand their full range of options. The [http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/software.cfm/ID=622/pagename=alpha_list_sub Department of Energy (DOE) Software Directory] describes EnergyActio software, a cloud based platform designed for this purpose.

==Sustainable energy==
{{Main|Sustainable energy}}

Energy efficiency and [[renewable energy]] are said to be the “twin pillars” of a sustainable [[energy policy]]. Both strategies must be developed concurrently in order to stabilize and reduce [[carbon dioxide emissions]]. Efficient energy use is essential to slowing the energy demand growth so that rising [[clean energy]] supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use. If energy use grows too rapidly, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. Likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total carbon emissions; a reduction in the carbon content of energy sources is also needed. A sustainable energy economy thus requires major commitments to both efficiency and renewables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paenergyfuture.psu.edu/pubs/aceee_reports/aceee2007sustainable.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111000420/http://www.paenergyfuture.psu.edu/pubs/aceee_reports/aceee2007sustainable.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-11 |df=}}([[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies such as Lieef (www.Lieef.com) have started reporting ESG metrics on behalf of companies, and investment funds, in an effort to increase transparency in the space which to date has increased in importance, but has not found a unified measurement tool. In addition, the majority of companies that report sustainability do so on a 'net' basis, and do not reflect their carbon emissions, and separate those emissions from their activities that offset those emissions, such as buying renewable credits and green power..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Lieef.com/ |title=Lieef.com; Lieef inc |publisher=Lieef.com |date=2018-05-28 |accessdate=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rebound effect==
{{Further|Rebound effect (conservation)|Jevons' paradox}}
If the demand for energy services remains constant, improving energy efficiency will reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. However, many efficiency improvements do not reduce energy consumption by the amount predicted by simple engineering models. This is because they make energy services cheaper, and so consumption of those services increases. For example, since fuel efficient vehicles make travel cheaper, consumers may choose to drive farther, thereby offsetting some of the potential energy savings. Similarly, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that energy efficiency improvements were almost always outpaced by economic growth, resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won't Save Us or the Environment''], Chapter 5, "In Search of Solutions II: Efficiency Improvements", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; These are examples of the direct [[rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effect]].&lt;ref name=direct&gt;[http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/Downloads/PDF/07/0710ReboundEffect/0710ReboundEffectReport.pdf The Rebound Effect: an assessment of the evidence for economy-wide energy savings from improved energy efficiency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910051917/http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/Downloads/PDF/07/0710ReboundEffect/0710ReboundEffectReport.pdf |date=2008-09-10}} pp. v-vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6133">An '''exclusion zone''' is a territorial division established for various case specific purposes. 

Per the [[United States Department of Defense]], an exclusion zone is a territory where sanctioning body prohibits specific activities in a specific geographic area (see [[Military exclusion zone]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url   = http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/data/e/9463.html | title = exclusion zone | work  = [[Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms]] | publisher  = [[United States Department of Defense]] | accessdate = February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These zones are created for control of populations for safety, crowd control, or military purposes, or as a [[border zone]], and they may be temporary or permanent.

==Nuclear disaster exclusion zones==

Large-scale geographic exclusion zones have been established after major disasters in which nuclear power plants went into meltdown:

*[[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] &amp;ndash; [[Ukraine]], established 1986.
*[[Fukushima Exclusion Zone]] &amp;ndash; [[Japan]], established 2011.
*[[East Ural Radioactive Trace]] &amp;ndash; [[Russia]], established 1958.

== Border zones ==
[[Border zone]]s are areas where movement, property ownership or other activity is prohibited or restricted by legislation. Unlike regular territory, border zones are under administrative control of the border authorities. Entrance is generally only with an individual permit. Entering a border zone without authorization is a crime or misdemeanor and grounds for arrest. Border zones are instituted to pinpoint illegal intruders, conceal and obscure and prevent interference with border security procedures and equipment, and thus aid border guards with their work. For example, Russia maintains [[Border Security Zone of Russia|sizable border zones]].

==Natural disaster exclusion zones==

Similarly, exclusion zones have been established due to natural disasters. There is an exclusion zone on the island of [[Montserrat]], where the long-dormant [[Soufrière Hills]] volcano started erupting in 1995 and has continued erupting since. It encompasses the south part of the island, accounting for over half of its land mass and most areas of the island which were populated before the volcano erupted. The volcano destroyed the island's urban center and capital [[Plymouth, Montserrat|Plymouth]], as well as many other villages and neighborhoods. The zone is now strictly enforced; entry into most of the destroyed areas is prohibited, while some areas are subject to restrictions during volcanic activity or open only as a "daytime entry zone".

==  Construction  ==
Exclusion zones are commonly used in the construction industry worldwide. For this purpose they are defined locations to prohibit the entry of personnel in to danger areas, established through the risk assessment process for a construction activity. Typically, exclusion zones are set up and maintained around plant and below work at height.

==  Protesting  ==

With regard to protesting, an exclusion zone is an area that protesters are legally prohibited from protesting in.

Exclusion zones often exist around [[seat of government|seats of government]] and [[abortion clinic]]s. As a result of protests by the [[Westboro Baptist Church]] at the funerals of soldiers killed in the [[Iraq War]], 29 states and the US Congress created exclusion zones around soldiers' funerals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-09-13-funeral-protests_x.htm Funeral protesters say laws can't silence them]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] created a one kilometre exclusion zone around itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-19308982-details/Exclusion+zone+to+Parliament+protests/article.do;jsessionid=b2CbHmRGGmsFm9NhLKCv5fGLGpxxFGZXRqsXSdpTnmFjyLM2ptL1!-1339398235!-1407319225!7001!-1 Exclusion Zone to Parliament Protests]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] states that "Congress shall make no law... abridging... the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." The existence of exclusion zones is based on court rulings that allow the government to regulate the time, place, and manner of protests.

An exclusion zone is related to a [[free speech zone]]. Protesters are required to picket in a free speech zone, thus rendering the area around the free speech zone to be an exclusion zone.

== Restraining orders ==

When a [[restraining order]] is issued, an exclusion zone is an area that the respondent is prohibited from entering—often an area surrounding the petitioner's residence or workplace.  For example, if a [[Wisconsin]] [[Harassment Restraining Order|harassment restraining order]] or [[Domestic Abuse Restraining Order|domestic abuse restraining order]] is violated, the court may order [[GPS]] monitoring of the respondent.&lt;ref name="wislegis2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin Legislature 813.129|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/813/129|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=5 Jul 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wislegisexclusionzone"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin Legislature 301.49|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/301/49|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the exclusion zone is entered, in violation of the order, the GPS technology is used to notify law enforcement and the petitioner.&lt;ref name="gpsexclusionzone"&gt;{{cite web|title=Databases for Wisconsin Civil and Criminal Information|url=http://www.endabusewi.org/sites/default/files/resources/ii-bciv-d_ro_civil_criminal_databases_wi.pdf|publisher=End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin - Legal Department|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a "fixes that fail" scenario the encounter of a problem is faced by a corrective action or fix that seems to solve the issue. However, this action leads to some unforeseen consequences. They form then a [[feedback]] loop that either worsens the original problem or creates a related one.&lt;ref name="pegas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="re5" /&gt;
[[File:ftf.jpg|none|framed|'''Fig. 1: Causal loop diagram''']]

In [[system dynamics]] this is described by a [[causal loop diagram|circles of causality]] (Fig. 1) as a system consisting of two [[feedback]] loops. One is the [[negative feedback|balancing feedback]] loop B1 of the corrective action, the second is the [[positive feedback|reinforcing feedback]] loop R2 of the unintended consequences. These influence the problem with a delay and therefore make it difficult to recognize the source of the new rise of the problem.&lt;ref name="5th" /&gt;

Representation of the long-term disadvantages of the scenario can be seen on Fig. 2. Although the symptoms go through a decrease when fixes are applied, the overall crisis threshold rises.&lt;ref name="braun" /&gt;&lt;ref name=kim&gt;Kim, Daniel H., "Fixes that Fail: Why Faster is Slower," ''The Systems Thinker Newsletter,'' Vol. 10, No. 3 (Apr., 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:ftfgraph.png|none|framed|'''Fig. 2: Behavior over time''']]

A representation with a [[stock and flow]] diagram of this [[archetype]] is on Fig. 3.
[[File:Ftfstockflow.png|none|framed|'''Fig. 3: Stock and flow diagram''']]
The fix influences the number of problems present in the system proportionally to the fix factor and the problems to be resolved. When activated by the action variable, the fix lowers the problems, thus creating a balancing loop. However, each fix also starts a delayed consequence which adds to the problems proportionally to the consequence factor and the fix applied. Combined, these create a growing number of problems to be dealt with.

== Uses ==
As an archetype, it helps to gain insight into patterns that are present in the system and thereby also give the tools to change these patterns. In the case of "Fixes that fail", the warning sign is a problem which reappears although fixes were applied. It is crucial to recognize that the fix only adds to the overall deteriorating state and does not solve the problem. To identify this pattern, it is needed to consider a connection between the symptoms and the fixes we apply to solve them, which can be very difficult to do.&lt;ref name="braun" /&gt; In management this can be present as a "hero-scapegoat" cycle. While the manager who applied the fix gets promoted for diminishing the problem. A new manager must face the returning problem symptom and may be punished for failing to do his job. Then a new hero is found who temporarily solves the problem symptoms. The delay of the reinforcing loop makes it difficult to recognize the causal relation between the fix applied to the symptoms and the new problems arising. What then seems to be a series of successes in short-term then are steps towards failure on the long-term.&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt;

Some typical ways of thinking associated with the pattern are:
* "It always seemed to work before; why isn't it working now?"&lt;ref name="5th" /&gt;
* "This is a simple problem and the solution is straightforward."&lt;ref name=syswiki&gt;[http://www.systemswiki.org/index.php?title=Category:Fixes_that_Fail Fixes That Fail Archetype] SystemsWiki, October 2010. Retrieved 2011-11-01&lt;/ref&gt;
* "We need to fix this problem now. We can deal with any consequences later." &lt;ref name=syswiki /&gt;
They can serve as a warning that this archetype is present or will be. 

If this pattern is recognized, then there are multiple possibilities how to react, depending on which [[lever]]age point is addressed:
* Focus on the long-term and if a fix is inevitably needed, use it only to buy time to work on the long-term remedy.&lt;ref name="5th" /&gt;
* Raise awareness of the unintended consequences of the fixes.
* Focus on the underlying problem and not the symptoms.
* Find either a fix without consequences or with limited long-term impact.&lt;ref name="pegas" /&gt;
* Find a way to measure the intended and also unintended consequences of the solutions by learning also from the past fixes.&lt;ref name="braun" /&gt;
* Change the performance review time so that the long-term progress becomes visible.&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt;

== Examples ==
A few common examples of the pattern. The situation describes always the starting point to which a fix is applied. This bears then the consequences which are confronted again with a new fix.

* &lt;big&gt;'''Maximizing ROR'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref name="5th" /&gt;
:'''Situation''': A manufacturing company becomes successful with high-performance parts, and its CEO wants to maximize the [[Rate of return|ROR]].
:'''Fix''': Refusal of investment in expensive, new production machines.
:'''Consequences''': The product quality drops and therefore the sales of it.

* &lt;big&gt;'''Cutting back maintenance'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref name="5th" /&gt;
: '''Situation''': The company needs to [[saving|save]] money.
: '''Fix''': Decrease the amount of [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]].
: '''Consequences''': More breakdowns of the equipment, higher costs and cost-cutting pressure.

* &lt;big&gt;'''Quest for water'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref name=syswiki /&gt;
: '''Situation''': Farmers are confronted with water shortage.
: '''Fix''': Drilling new wells or making the old ones deeper.
: '''Consequences''': The [[water table]] drops.

* &lt;big&gt;'''Cash shortage'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref name=kim /&gt;&lt;ref name=syswiki /&gt;
: '''Situation''': A person can't pay [[interest]] (for example on a [[credit card]]).
: '''Fix''': Take up a new [[loan]] to pay the interest (a new credit card).
: '''Consequences''': There is more interest to pay next time.

* &lt;big&gt;'''Tax revenue shortage'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref name=syswiki /&gt;
: '''Situation''': A government is not satisfied with its [[tax revenue]]s.
: '''Fix''': Increase the cigarette tax to raise more taxes.
: '''Consequences''': Smuggling of cigarettes develops and reduces the number of taxed cigarettes sold in the country.

'''Florian Pumhösl''' (born 1971) is an artist based in [[Vienna]], mainly known for his works that employ abstract visual language to reflect on the diverse manifestations of modernity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://moussemagazine.it/florian-pumhosl-andrea-viliani-2008/|title=Florian Pumhösl •Mousse Magazine|website=moussemagazine.it|language=it-IT|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
1989–91 Höhere Grafische Bundeslehr- und Versuchsanstalt Wien

1989–97 Hochschule für angewandte Kunst Wien

==Work==
Florian Pumhösl’s work is constituted by a constellation of historical references encoded within a visual language that appears purely formal. The apparent abstraction of his paintings, films, and installations is anchored by specific archival sources: 17th-century kimono designs, avant-garde typography, WWI military uniform patterns, cartography, Latin American textiles, and early dance notations. Through the selection, reduction, rearrangement, and reproduction of his source materials—unsystematic and subjective modes of transcription—the artist arrives at a vocabulary that is at once abstract and semiotically motivated.

Pumhösl’s compositions establish points of contact with realms traditionally consigned to the margins of modern art. Through attention to the social, political, and geographic genealogy of given forms, his works reveal that the modernist fantasy of complete self-referentiality was always already haunted by irreducible specificity and cultural instability. “I am calling into question to what extent it is possible to act within a space defined by the artist himself – a space that emerges from the hierarchy between my own authorship and its research sources, between historical references or concrete borrowings and what I can depict,” Pumhösl states. “My medium is the physical and historical space that I create using painting, architecture, film or photography.”

==Solo Exhibitions (Selection)==
Solo exhibitions of Pumhösl's work have been staged at [[Kunsthaus Bregenz]] (2012); [[Mumok]] (Vienna, 2011);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mumok.at/en/events/florian-pumhosl|title=Florian Pumhösl|website=www.mumok.at|language=en|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kunstverein für die Rheinlande und Westfalen (Düsseldorf, 2010);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kunstverein-duesseldorf.de/ausstellungen/archiv/bis-2011.html|title=bis 2011 - Kunstverein Düsseldorf|website=www.kunstverein-duesseldorf.de|language=de|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mudam|Musée d’Art Moderne Grand-Duc Jean]] (Luxembourg, 2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mudam.lu/en/expositions/details/exposition/florian-pumhoesl/|title=MUDAM: Florian Pumhösl|website=www.mudam.lu|language=en-EN|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam|Stedelijk Museum]] (Amsterdam, 2008);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stedelijk.nl/nl/tentoonstellingen/florian-pumhoesl--programm|title=florian pumhösl - programm|last=Grrr.nl|website=www.stedelijk.nl|language=nl|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neue Kunsthalle St. Gallen (2005);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kunsthallesanktgallen.ch/de/publikation/florian-pumhoesl-animated-map.html|title=Florian Pumhösl Animated Map, Kunst Halle Sankt Gallen|last=|first=|date=|website=www.kunsthallesanktgallen.ch|language=de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centre d’édition contemporaine (Geneva, 2004);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.c-e-c.ch/fr/florian-pumhoslheliogravures-et-film/|title=Centre d'édition contemporaine, Genève, Florian Pumhosl Heliogravures et film|last=|first=|date=|website=www.c-e-c.ch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kölnischer Kunstverein]] (Cologne, 2003); Secession (Vienna, 2000); and [[Salzburger Kunstverein]] (1998),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salzburger-kunstverein.at/en/exhibitions/1998/1998-04-25/florian-pumh|title=Salzburger Kunstverein  / Exhibitions / 1998|website=www.salzburger-kunstverein.at|language=de|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

'''Freedom of Information laws''' ('''FOI laws''') allow access by the general public to data held by national governments. The emergence of freedom of information legislation was a response to increasing dissatisfaction with the secrecy surrounding government policy development and decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/other/media/MLWS%2520Commentary/FOI%2520Commentary/460.htm?stem=0&amp;synonyms=0&amp;query=commentary|title=FOI Commentary|website=austlii.edu.au|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; They establish a "right-to-know" legal process by which requests may be made for government-held information, to be received freely or at minimal cost, barring standard exceptions. Also variously referred to as '''open records''', or '''sunshine laws''' (in the [[United States]]), governments are typically bound by a duty to publish and promote openness. In many countries there are constitutional guarantees for the right of access to information, but these are usually unused if specific support legislation does not exist.

==Introduction==
{{Main|Access to public information}}
{{See also|Freedom of information}}

Over 100 countries around the world have implemented some form of [[freedom of information]] legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/26216|title=Statement by European RTI Community on the world’s First Official Access to Information Day!|author=|date=|website=access-info.org|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://right2info.org/access-to-information-laws/access-to-information-laws-overview-and-statutory#_ftnref7 |title=Access to Information Laws: Overview and Statutory Goals |publisher=Right2info.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Sweden|Sweden]]'s [[Constitution of Sweden#Public access to governmental documents|Freedom of the Press Act]] of 1766 is the oldest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.access-info.org/documents/Access_Docs/Thinking/Get_Connected/worlds_first_foia.pdf |title=The World's First Freedom of Information Act |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305004359/http://www.access-info.org/documents/Access_Docs/Thinking/Get_Connected/worlds_first_foia.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Staples, William R.|title=Encyclopedia of privacy|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mE9fo1rw1SkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:Encyclopedia+intitle:of+intitle:Privacy&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=O2muT7i8HIWi0QW1kr2WCQ&amp;ved=0CDEQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=intitle%3AEncyclopedia%20intitle%3Aof%20intitle%3APrivacy&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most freedom of information laws exclude the private sector from their jurisdiction thus information held by the private sector cannot be accessed as a legal right. This limitation has serious implications because the private sector performs many functions which were previously the domain of the public sector. As a result, information that was previously public is now within the private sector, and the private contractors cannot be forced to disclose information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=[[Journal of Alternative Perspectives in the Social Sciences]]|year=2010|volume=2|issue=1|pages=211–226|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries are working towards introducing such laws, and many regions of countries with national legislation have local laws. For example, all U.S. states have laws governing access to public documents belonging to the state and local taxing entities. Additionally, the U.S. Freedom of Information Act governs record management of documents in the possession of the federal government.

A related concept is '''open meetings''' legislation, which allows access to government meetings, not just to the records of them. In many countries, [[privacy]] or [[data protection]] laws may be part of the freedom of information legislation; the concepts are often closely tied together in political discourse.

A basic principle behind most freedom of information legislation is that the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] falls on the body ''asked'' for information, not the person ''asking'' for it. The person making the request does not usually have to give an explanation for their actions, but if the information is not disclosed a valid reason has to be given.

In 2015 The [[UNESCO]] General Conference voted to designate Sept. 28 as “International Day for the Universal Access to Information” or, as it is more commonly known, [[Access to Information Day]]. The date had previously been celebrated as “Right to Know Day” since 2002.  The UNESCO resolution recommends approval by the [[UN General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2015/11/unesco-names-sept-28-access-to-information-day/|title=UNESCO Names Sept. 28 Access to Information Day|last=|first=|date=17 November 2015|publisher=freedominfo.org|access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Access to public information in Bulgaria}}

{{Update|section|date=February 2017}}
In [[Bulgaria]], the '''Access to Public Information Act''' was passed in 2000, following a 1996 recommendation from the Constitutional Court to implement such a law.

===Canada===
{{Main|Freedom of information in Canada}}
In [[Canada]], the '''[[Access to Information Act]]''' allows citizens to demand records from federal bodies. The act came into force in 1983, under the [[Pierre Trudeau]] government, permitting Canadians to retrieve information from government files, establishing what information could be accessed, mandating timelines for response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2010.01-national-affairs-the-dark-country/2/#|title=The Dark Country|accessdate=18 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103105048/http://walrusmagazine.com/articles/2010.01-national-affairs-the-dark-country/2/|archivedate=3 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is enforced by the [[Information Commissioner of Canada]].

There is also a complementary '''''[[Privacy Act (Canada)|Privacy Act]]''''' that was introduced in 1983. The purpose of the ''Privacy Act'' is to extend the present laws of Canada that protect the [[privacy]] of individuals with respect to personal information about themselves held by a federal government institution and that provide individuals with a right of access to that information. It is a [[Crown copyright]]. Complaints for possible violations of the Act may be reported to the [[Privacy Commissioner of Canada]].

Canadian access to information laws distinguish between access to records generally and access to records that contain [[personal information]] about the person making the request. Subject to exceptions, individuals have a right of access to records that contain their own personal information under the ''[[Privacy Act (Canada)|Privacy Act]]'' but the general public does not have a right of access to records that contain personal information about others under the ''[[Access to Information Act]]''.
Each province and territory in Canada has its own access to information legislation. In many cases, this is also the provincial public sector privacy legislation. For example:
* Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act ([[Alberta]])
* Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act ([[Manitoba]])
* [[Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Nova Scotia)]]
* Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act ([[Ontario]])
* Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act ([[Saskatchewan]])
* Act respecting access to documents held by public bodies and the protection of personal information ([[Quebec]])

From 1989 to 2008, requests made to the federal government were catalogued in the [[Coordination of Access to Information Requests System]].

A 393-page report released in September 2008, sponsored by several Canadian newspaper groups, compares Canada's Access to Information Act to the FOI laws of the provinces and of 68 other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.telus.net/index100/foi |title=Fallen Behind: Canada’s Access to Information Act in the World Context |publisher=.telus.net |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[The Walrus (magazine)]] published a detailed history of FOI in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2010.01-national-affairs-the-dark-country] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917055940/http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2010.01-national-affairs-the-dark-country|date=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colombia===
The [[Colombia]]n constitution grants the right of access to public information through ''Law 57 of 1985'' which thereby mandates the publishing of acts and official documents.

Additionally there is the anti [[corruption]] statement of ''Law 190 of 1955'' also known as ''anti corruption act'' which in its 51st article mandates public offices to list in visible area all the contracts and purchases made by month. The latter taking place slowly. A more modern law, the "Ley de transparencia y del derecho de acceso a la información pública nacional" its at its final stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://congresovisible.org/proyectos-de-ley/por-medio-de-la-cual/6501/|language=Spanish|title=Congreso Visible|accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 23 of the [[Colombian Constitution of 1991|constitution]] states that "Every person has the right to present petitions to the authorities for the general or private interest and to secure their prompt resolution. The legislative body may regulate the presentation of petitions to private organisations in order to guarantee fundamental rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/colombia_const2.pdf|title = Text of the Constitution of Colombia (1991)|date = |accessdate = 7 October 2015|website = http://confinder.richmond.edu/|publisher = Richmond University|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article justifies the existence of a jurisdictional mechanism known a petition action. This action is regulated by the law 1755 of 2015 and is considered by the Colombian Judicial Doctrine as a fundamental human right. According to the law all petitions should be fully addressed in 15 business days. If not addressed the official in charge of resolving the petition may be charged with misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Consulta de la Norma:|url = http://www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co/sisjur/normas/Norma1.jsp?i=62152|website = www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A law that falls below Council of Europe standards in the Northern occupied part of Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;Right to Access Information Law No. 12 of 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The right to access to public information is provided in different ways in the two parts of the island, in which Cyprus is de facto divided.

As to 2011, a research by the Open Cyprus Project showed that there was a level of 75% of administrative silence island-wide, in response to information requests.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmediafreedom.eu/Publications/Reports/The-Right-of-Access-to-Information-in-Cyprus.-Report-and-Recommendations|title=The Right of Access to Information in Cyprus.

====Scope====
According to the Act of 1985, Section 4 Part 1 “any person may ask to see documents received or issued by an administrative authority.”&lt;ref&gt;The Folketing, “The Danish Access to Public Administrative Documents Act,” Chapter 2, Section 4.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Information concerning administrative matters of the public administration; electricity and heating utilities as well as private bodies receiving public funding or performing public function can be acquired. Yet, the information concerning activities of judicial branch and legislators is not accessible.&lt;ref&gt;The Folketing, “The Danish Access to Public Administrative Documents Act,” Chapter 1, Section 2.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;“Global Right to Information Rating: Denmark,” Centre for Law and Democracy.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Procedure====
Reasons do not have to be given while making a request; however, the authorities can ask for additional information regarding document.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The requests are supposed to be handled as soon as possible; if within period of 10 days response to an application was not provided, the authority has to inform on reasons for the delay as well as expected date for a decision.&lt;ref&gt;The Folketing, “The Danish Access to Public Administrative Documents Act,” Chapter 4, Section 16.1 and Section 16.2.&lt;/ref&gt; More detailed procedures are not laid down in the Act.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Exceptions====
Access to information is limited by “the obligation to maintain secrecy.”&lt;ref name="Folketing"&gt;The Folketing, “The Danish Access to Public Administrative Documents Act,”.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Ch.4, S.14}} Considerations of State security, defence, foreign policy, external economic interests as well as public financial interests can limit the granting of access to the information.&lt;ref name="Folketing"/&gt;{{rp|Ch.3, S.13}}
Registers and records processed electronically are excluded from the administrative documents that can be given access to.&lt;ref name="Folketing"/&gt;{{rp|Ch.2, S.5.2}} Section 10 outlines other areas excluded from access, such as records of meetings of the [[Council of State (Denmark)|Council of State]], minutes, as well as documents prepared for such meetings; correspondence between ministries concerning legislation and material used for scientific research or public statistics.&lt;ref name="Folketing"/&gt;{{rp|Ch.3, S.10}}

====Appeals====
Decision to grant or not to grant access can be appealed.&lt;ref name="CLD"&gt;“Global Right to Information Rating: Denmark,” Centre for Law and Democracy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Folketing"/&gt;{{rp|Ch.4, S.15.2}} Decisions can also be appealed externally to Folketingets Ombudsman.&lt;ref name="CLD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Banisar"&gt;David Banisar, “Freedom of Information and Access to Government Record Laws around the World,” The freedominfo.org Global Survey, May 2004, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ombudsman can also deliver opinions and review decisions; however, these are not binding even though generally followed.&lt;ref name="Banisar"/&gt; Ombudsman receives 200-300 complaints annually; approximately 15 percent of complaints are ruled in favour of appellants.&lt;ref name="Banisar"/&gt;

====Revisions====
The exemption regarding EU documents was taken out of the Act in 1991.&lt;ref name="Banisar2"&gt;Banisar, “Freedom of Information and Access to Government Record Laws around the World,” 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Amendments were also made in 2000; they concerned data on the employees of the Government.&lt;ref name="Banisar2"/&gt; In January 2014 new Public Records Act was enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Helle Krunke, “Freedom of Information and Open Government in Denmark: Progress or Deterioration?”&lt;/ref&gt; The new act was highly debated since it was considered to limit transparency in the Government and legislative proceedings; Denmark received one point less in the category of Political Environment when compared with the Freedom of the Press report of 2015.&lt;ref name="Freedom-Press"&gt;Freedom House, “Country Report: Denmark.” Freedom of the Press 2016, https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2016/denmark.&lt;/ref&gt; The new legislation caused demonstrations and protests.&lt;ref name="Freedom-Press"/&gt; It can be regarded as a response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name="Freedom-Press"/&gt; After the Public Records Act of 2013 came into effect, public access to information regarding the [[Danish Security and Intelligence Service|Intelligence Services]] instead of falling under the Public Records Act is now managed by the Act on the Security and Intelligence Service as well as the Act on the Defense Intelligence Service.&lt;ref name="Freedom-Press"/&gt; In addition, the access to legislative process was further restricted. According to the new Act documents in the drafting stage are not to be accessed as well as “other corresponding political activities,” so restriction is not concerning only Bills.&lt;ref name="Freedom-Press"/&gt; In the future, it will not be possible to find the calendars of ministers being published.&lt;ref name="Freedom-Press"/&gt; Nevertheless, the Act was created while keeping in mind the strengthening the project of the Open Government; the list of institutions covered by the Act was extended as well as list of public-private institutions and companies.&lt;ref name="Freedom-Press"/&gt;

In [[Estonia]], the '''Public Information Act'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legaltext.ee/et/andmebaas/tekst.asp?loc=text&amp;dok=X40095K2&amp;keel=en&amp;pg=1&amp;ptyyp=RT&amp;tyyp=X&amp;query=public+information|title=Parliament of Estonia, Public Information Act Passed 15 November 2000|publisher=Legaltext.ee|date=2000-11-15|accessdate=2010-11-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123013320/http://www.legaltext.ee/et/andmebaas/tekst.asp?loc=text&amp;dok=X40095K2&amp;keel=en&amp;pg=1&amp;ptyyp=RT&amp;tyyp=X&amp;query=public+information|archivedate=23 November 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 2000 extends to all "holders of information", which is clarified as being all government and local government bodies, [[legal persons in public law]] and [[legal person]]s in private law if they are performing public duties (providing health, education etc.).

===Europe===
In matters concerning the local, national and transboundary environment, the [[Aarhus convention]] grants the public rights regarding access to information, public participation and access to justice in governmental [[decision-making]] processes. It focuses on interactions between the public and public authorities.

====Council of Europe====
The recognition of the right to access to public information under [[Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 10]] (including "freedom (..) to receive (..) information") of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] was one of subjects in ''Guerra v. Italy'' case before the European Court of Human Rights in 1998. The majority considered Article 10 was not applicable to the complaint. However, the court found that in the specific case, which included living near a high-risk factory, not providing information was in violation of [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 8]] (respect to private and family life). Besides, two judges expressed a dissent on applicability of Article 10, and further six judges reserved a possibility, that in other circumstances, right to access to information could be protected by Article 10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=696012&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Grand Chamber judgment on application no. 14967/89] See para. 50-60, as well as concurring opinion of Mrs Palm, joined by Mr Bernhardt, Mr Russo, Mr Macdonald, Mr Makarczyk and Mr van Dijk, partly dissenting opinion of Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson, concurring opinion of Mr Jambrek&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] has considered in 1996, that "public access to clear and full information on this subject [Chernobyl disaster]—and many others for that matter—must be viewed as a basic human right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta96/ERES1087.htm|title=PACE resolution no. 1087 (1996) on the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster|publisher=Assembly.coe.int|date=1996-04-26|accessdate=2010-11-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717004711/http://www.assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FAdoptedText%2Fta96%2FERES1087.htm|archivedate=2011-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, CoE Convention on Access to Official Documents was opened for signature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=205&amp;CM=2&amp;DF=23/11/2010&amp;CL=ENG |title=Convention on Access to Official Documents |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |date=2009-06-18 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====European Union====

=====Right of access to documents of the Union=====
'''Article 42 [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|CFR]]''' and '''Article 15 [[TFEU]]''' give ″[a]ny citizen of the Union, and any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in a Member State, [...] a right of access to documents of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union, whatever their medium." It follows from Article 15 TFEU that this right is "subject to the principles and the conditions to be defined" in legislation.

'''Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2001:145:0043:0048:EN:PDF |title=Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; further defines this right of access to documents of the three institutions; for most other EU bodies and agencies, there is a provision in the legal act establishing them which makes Regulation No 1049/2001 applicable to them as well.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2001:173:0005:0005:EN:PDF Joint declaration relating to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001]; for the [[European External Action Service|EEAS]], see Article 11 of [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:201:0030:0040:EN:PDF Council Decision 2010/427/EU]&lt;/ref&gt; In some other cases, specific rules apply (e.g. to the [[European Economic and Social Committee|EESC]],&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:205:0019:0023:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Committee of the Regions|CoR]],&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:160:0096:0099:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2013:038:0002:0004:EN:PDF |title=The requested document does not exist. - EUR-Lex |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Auditors]]&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:067:0001:0004:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Central Bank|ECB]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2004D0003:20110618:EN:PDF |title=The requested document does not exist. - EUR-Lex |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Document" is defined broadly and it is assumed that all documents, even if classified, may be subject to right of access unless it falls under one of the exceptions. If access is refused, the applicant is allowed a confirmatory request. A complaint against a refusal can be made with the European Ombudsman and/or an appeal can be brought before the European [[General Court (European Union)|General Court]].

=====Re-use of public sector information=====
In addition, '''Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 17 November 2003 on the re-use of public sector information'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:345:0090:0096:EN:PDF |title=Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 17 November 2003 on the re-use of public sector information |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; sets out the rules and practices for accessing public sector information resources for further exploitation. This directive has been reviewed in 2013 by '''Directive 2013/37/EU of the European Parliament and the Council of 26 June 2013 amending Directive 2003/98/EC on the re-use of public sector information'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:175:0001:0008:EN:PDF|title=Directive 2003/98/EC on the re-use of public sector information|last=|first=|date=2013-06-26|website=|publisher=EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL|access-date=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Register of lobbyists=====
Since 2008, the [[European Commission]] operates the Register of Interest representatives, a voluntary register of lobbyists at the European union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/transparency/regrin/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090520212359/https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/transparency/regrin/ |archivedate=2009-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Access to Environmental Information=====
[[Freedom of access to information Directive|Directive 2003/4/EC]] of the European Parliament and Council provides for citizens of each country to have freedom of access to information on the environment, in line with the requirements of the [[Aarhus Convention]]. Governments are required to transcribe the directive into national legislation (for example, in the United Kingdom, the [[Environmental Information Regulations 2004]]).

=====Personal data=====
Directive 95/46/EC, the [[Data Protection Directive|Data Protection directive]], provides a variety of rights in relation to personal data, including a right of access. This has been transcribed into national legislation through, for example, the [[Data Protection Act 1998]] (United Kingdom) and the Data Protection 2003 (Ireland).

===Finland===
In [[Finland]], the '''Laki yleisten asiakirjain julkisuudesta 9.2.1951/83''' (''Act on the Openness of Public Documents'' of 1951) established the openness of all records and documents in the possession of officials of the state, municipalities, and registered religious communities. Exceptions to the basic principle could only be made by law, or by an executive order for specific enumerated reasons such as national security. The openness of unsigned draft documents was not mandated, but up to the consideration of the public official. This weakness of the law was removed when the law was revised in the 1990s. The revised law, the '''Laki viranomaisten toiminnan julkisuudesta 21.5.1999/621''' (''Act on the Openness of Government Activities'' of 1999), called in short "Publicity Act" ({{lang-fi|Julkisuuslaki}}) also extended the principle of openness to corporations that perform legally mandated public duties, such as pension funds and public utilities, and to computer documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.om.fi/23963.htm|title=Act on the Openness of Government Activities, Finnish Ministry of Justice|publisher=Om.fi|date=2007-05-31|accessdate=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Publicity Act establishes a process by which any person may access any record in possession of an authority. The person may ask the authority for the document in person or in writing. When making the request, the requester needs to specify the document so that it can be identified. However, the authority is liable to assist the person with its document registers and indices in this task. After receiving the request, the authority has two weeks to give the document. If the decision is negative, and document is withheld, the requester may appeal to the administrative court. The document may be given orally, for reading and copying in the authority's premises or as an electronic or paper copy, as requested by the person. However, the copying may be declined if it would be unfeasible because of the large number of documents or otherwise technically difficult. There are also a number of limitations on the release of electronic documents designed for the protection of the individual privacy.&lt;ref name=julkisuuslaki&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1999/19990621 Laki viranomaisten toiminnan julkisuudesta] (621/1999). Retrieved on 2015-11-17. {{Fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|§§13, 14, 15}}

The reasons for withholding a document are listed in the article 24 of the Act. They may be grouped to three categories: automatic non-openness, conditional non openness or conditional openness. The documents where automatic non-openness is prescribed remain withheld in all cases. In the case of conditional non-openness, the reasonability of the non-openness is reviewed case-by-case by the authority and, if appeals are made, by the court. In the third category, openness is a rule, and the reason for non-openness needs to be established by the authority.&lt;ref name="julkisuuslaki"/&gt;{{rp|§24}}

The absolute reasons for non-openness are (subpoint of Article 24 in captions)&lt;ref name="julkisuuslaki"/&gt;{{rp|§24}}
*Documents of the foreign policy committee of the [[Government of Finland|Council of State]], foreign policy memos of the foreign ministry on political status, negotiations with foreign governments or organisations and diplomatic cryptograms, unless released by the ministry (1)
*registers held by law enforcement for investigation and prevention of crimes, as well as passport or ID card photos and biometric information on them (4)
*statistics and other documents on economic policy that might affect financial markets, until they are released to public (13)
*documents handed over to a statistical authority for the compilation of statistics and documents handed over voluntarily to an authority for purposes of research and statistics (16)

*documents identifying an anonymous witness (31a)
*documents containing information on individual's political opinions, hobbies, personal habits, membership and activities in associations, family life or opinions uttered within private life. However, information on having held positions of responsibility held or having been a candidate for them is public, as well as being aa founding member of a political party or electoral association. (32)

Conditional non-openness is mandated for the following categories of documents, unless it is "obviously clear" that the protected interest is not endangered&lt;ref name="julkisuuslaki"/&gt;{{rp|§24.1}}
* documents concerning international relations of Finland, Finnish institutions or Finnish persons, unless it is obviously clear that no harm will befall on Finnish foreign relations now or in the future (2)
* documents concerning criminal investigations or pending prosecutions until the investigation is over or the prosecution has pleaded, unless it is obviously clear that the investigation or the prosecution is not harmed and no private person will suffer material harm nor suffering (3)
* documents on security of buildings, facilities, communications or information systems, unless it is obviously clear that the security is not endangered (7)
* all documents of [[Finnish Security Intelligence Service]] and other documents concerning state security, unless it is obviously clear that state security is not endangered (9)
* documents concerning national defence or military intelligence, unless it is obviously clear that national defence is in no way harmed or endangered (10)
* documents, records and data used as a basis for or concerning an academic thesis, scientific or scholarly research or product development, unless it is obviously clear that the research, development or study, their proper evaluation, the student or the researcher or the funder of the work are not harmed (21)
*documents concerning a refugee or an applicant for a visa, residence permit or an asylum, unless it is obviously clear that the person or his loved ones are not harmed (24)
*information contained in the [[criminal register]] and in other registers held by authorities overseeing the execution of punishments, as well as documents of authorities if they contain personal information on persons who have lost their personal freedom or who participate in witness protection programme, unless it is obviously clear that the security, future employment and social reintegration of the person will not be endangered and there is a valid reason for releasing the specific information in question (28)

Conditional openness is prescribed for the following categories of information:&lt;ref name="julkisuuslaki"/&gt;{{rp|§24.1}}
*technical and tactical methods of police, [[Finnish Border Guard]] and prison authorities, if their release would make the work of such authorities more difficult (5)
*administrative complaints during their handling, if their release would harm investigation or be likely to cause suffering or harm to a party in the matter, unless grave reasons exist for release of information (6)
*information on civil defence or rescue preparations and on safety investigations, if the release would endanger rescue work, civil defence preparations, safety or security or their continued development, or would endanger getting information in future safety investigations, or would hurt the victims of an accident, their memory or their loved ones (8)
*information on financial, monetary, labour or fiscal policy measures or their preparations or pre-studies if the release would defeat the purpose of such measures, endanger the negotiation position of the state or otherwise cause great harm to the management of such policies (11)
*studies conducted by regulatory authorities of financial and pension institutions, if the studies include information on the regulated bodies and the release would endanger the proper functioning of financial markets (12)
*documents containing information on endangered species or valuable natural areas, if the release would endanger their preservation (14)
*documents pertaining to an investigation or other control measure by an authority if the release would endanger the regulatory control measure or its purpose (15)
*detailed returns of political candidates on their campaign funding (15)
*business and professional secrets of public bodies, if a competing the body would suffer economic harm, or a public or private body pursuing competing or similar activities would gain a competitive advantage by the release or if the possibilities of a body bound by the Publicity Act to make advantageous purchases or other financial arrangements would be harmed (17)
*documents used by a public body in a collective bargaining or labour action if the release would harm the public body as the employer (18)
*documents used for preparation of a legal action, if the release would harm a public body as a party to a suit (19)
*documents containing information on entrance examination or other examination or test, if the release would defeat the purpose of the test or exam or prevent its future use (22)
* documents containing sensitive information on the private life of a suspect, plaintiff, witness or other party to a criminal investigation, or information on the victim that would hurt the victim's memory or her loved ones, unless the release is necessary to conduct the work of an authority (26)

Non-open information remains non-open for 25 years after it was created or obtained by an authority. Documents that are non-open to protect the privacy of an individual remain non-open for 50 years after the protected individual has died.&lt;ref name="julkisuuslaki"/&gt;{{rp|§31.2,31,5}}

If information is still, after 25 years, valid and describes a security measure of a building, facility, system or method or it is still part of a plan used for national defence or civil defence, it remains non-open as long as the information is pertinent for the purpose. The same indefinite non-openness applies to all documents under international security obligations, if the release might still affect Finnish foreign relations negatively. The non-openness of other documents may be prolonged up to 55 years by the [[Council of State (Finland)|Council of State]], if necessary to safeguard a protected interest.&lt;ref name="julkisuuslaki"/&gt;{{rp|§31.3–4}}

===France===
In [[France]], the accountability of public servants is a constitutional right, according to the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]''.

The implementing legislation is the '''Loi n°78-753 du 17 juillet 1978 portant diverses mesures d'amélioration des relations entre l'administration et le public et diverses dispositions d'ordre administratif, social et fiscal''' (''Act No. 78-753 of 17 July 1978. On various measures for improved relations between the Civil Service and the public and on various arrangements of administrative, social and fiscal nature''). It sets as a general rule that citizens can demand a copy of any administrative document (in paper, digitised or other form), and establishes the ''Commission d’Accès aux Documents Administratifs'', an independent administrative authority, to oversee the process.

===Georgia===

{{main|Access to public information in Georgia}}

In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the General Administrative Code contains a '''Law on Freedom of Information'''.

===Germany===
In [[Germany]], the federal government passed a freedom of information law on September 5, 2005; it was last updated on August 7, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_ifg/index.html Federal Act Governing Access to Information held by the Federal Government (Freedom of Information Act)]''. The law of September 5, 2005, with amendments as of August 7, 2013; English translation from the German provided by the Federal Ministry of the Interior. Available on the website of the German Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection, as part of the project "Gesetze im Internet" (laws on the Internet), in cooperation with juris GMBH, a legal information service. Retrieved 2015-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The law grants each person an unconditional right to access official federal information. No legal, commercial, or any other kind of justification is necessary.

Twelve of the sixteen [[States of Germany|Bundesländer]]—[[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Berlin]], [[Brandenburg]], [[Bremen]], [[Hamburg]], [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Nordrhein-Westfalen]], [[Rheinland-Pfalz]], [[Saarland]], [[Sachsen-Anhalt]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]] and [[Thuringia|Thüringen]]—have approved individual "[[w:de:Informationsfreiheitsgesetz|Informationsfreiheitsgesetze]]" (Freedom of Information laws).

===Greece===
{{Main|Access to public information in Greece}}

In [[Greece]], the 1975 Greek Constitution guaranteed the right of access to administrative documents and the right of citizens to obtain information. However it was not until 1986 that the first law was passed to provide for access to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dorovinis|first1=Vassilis|last2=Etairia|first2=Elliniki|title=Doors to Democracy|date=June 1998|publisher=The Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern Europe|location=Szentendre, Hungary|isbn=963 8454 58 X|page=89|url=http://archive.rec.org/REC/Publications/PPDoors/WEST/cover.html|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 16 (Right to Access Administrative Documents—Δικαίωμα γνώσης διοικητικών εγγράφων) of Law 1599/1986 (State-citizenry Relationship—Σχέσεις Κράτους-πολίτη) introduced the right of all citizens to read most administrative documents. This right is now codified as article 5 (Access to documents—Πρόσβαση σε έγγραφα) of the Administrative Procedural Code (Κώδικας Διοικητικής Διαδικασίας), Law 2690/1999. Under this article, citizens have a right to know the content of administrative documents. Administrative documents are defined as those produced by public sector entities, such as reports, studies, minutes, statistical data, circulars, instructions, responses, consultatory responses, and decisions. In addition, citizens with a legitimate interest may also access ''private'' documents stored by public services. The right cannot be exercised if the document concerns the private or family lives of others, or if the document's confidentiality is safeguarded by specific legal provisions. Furthermore, the public body can refuse access if the document refers to discussions in the Cabinet, or if accessing the document can seriously hamper criminal or administrative violation investigations carried out by judicial, police, or military authorities.

Citizens may study the documents at the place where they are archived, or they may obtain a copy at their own cost. Access to one's own medical data is provided with the help of a doctor. Access to documents should take into account whether they be covered by copyright, patent, or trade secret regulations.

In addition, Law 3448/2006, on the reuse of public sector information, harmonises the national laws with the requirements on the [[Freedom of information legislation#European Union|European Union Directive 2003/98/EC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eae.org.gr/leg1_2690-art5.html Article 5 of the Administrative Procedures Code — Document Access] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730040742/http://www.eae.org.gr/leg1_2690-art5.html |date=2007-07-30 }} (in Greek)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
In [[Hong Kong]] there are no laws specifically enacted to guarantee the freedom of information.

Since March 1995, the [[Government of Hong Kong]] has promulgated a "Code on Access to Information" to serve a similar purpose. This code, like other internal regulations of the Government, was not legislated by the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and has a minimal legal status. It requires government agencies listed in its appendix to appoint Access to Information Officers to answer citizens' requests for governmental records. A fee may be charged prior to the release of information. The code does not require the government to archive information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.access.gov.hk/en/index.htm |title=Code on Access to Information |publisher=Access.gov.hk |date=2014-02-13 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
In [[Hungary]], the '''Act on the Protection of Personal Data and Public Access to Data of Public Interest''' of 1992 extends a right of access to all data of public interest, defined as any information processed by a body performing a governmental function. Complaints and contested applications may be appealed to the Data Protection Commissioner or to the court.

In 2005 the Parliament adopted the '''Act on the Freedom of Information by Electronic Means''' (Act XC of 2005). The Act has three basic parts: 1. electronic disclousure of certain data by public sector bodies, 2. publicity of legislation and 3. openness of Court decisions.

===Iceland===
In [[Iceland]] the Information Act (Upplysingalög) Act no. 50/1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.althingi.is/altext/lagas/141b/2012140.html |title=2012 nr. 140 28. desember/ Upplýsingalög |publisher=Althingi.is |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives access to public information.

===India===
{{main|Right to Information (India)}}

The [[Right to Information Act]] (RTI Act) was passed by [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] on 11 May 2005 and was published in the gazette of India on 15 June 2005. It came into effect on 12 October 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangedco.gov.in/chapter1.php|title=home page|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816165037/http://www.tangedco.gov.in/chapter1.php|archive-date=2016-08-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_right-to-information-act-to-complete-five-years-on-october-12_1450688 |title=Right to Information Act to complete five years on October 12 &amp;#124; Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date=2010-10-10 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; replacing the erstwhile Freedom of information Act, 2002. The Supreme Court of India had, in several Judgments prior to enactment of both Acts, interpreted Indian Constitution to read Right to Information as the Fundamental Right as embodied in Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression and also in Right to Life. RTI Act laid down a procedure to guarantee this right. Under this law all Government Bodies or Government funded agencies have to designate a Public Information Officer (PIO). The PIO's responsibility is to ensure that information requested is disclosed to the petitioner within 30 days or within 48 hours in case of information concerning the life or liberty of a person. The law was inspired by previous legislation from select states (among them [[Tamil Nadu]] (1997), [[Goa]] (1997), [[Rajasthan]] (2000), [[Karnataka]] (2000), [[Delhi]] (2001), [[Maharashtra]] (2002) etc.) that allowed the right to information (to different degrees) to citizens about activities of any State Government body.

A number of high-profile disclosures revealed corruption in various government schemes such scams in [[Public Distribution System]]s (ration stores), disaster relief, construction of highways etc. The law itself has been hailed as a landmark in India's drive towards more openness and accountability.

However the RTI India has certain weaknesses that hamper implementation.

[[RTI NEWS]]

'''On International Right to Information Day 1000 Copies of The RTI Act Sent by Mr. Naveen Agrawal in India'''

Nagpur (Dt.28/10/2018). 28 September is observed as International Right to Information Day across the world. Mr. Naveen Maheshkumar Agrawal, Registrar, Dada Ramchand Bakhru Sindhu Mahavidyalaya, with a view to creating awareness about the Right to Information Act, 2005 in society sent the soft copies of the RTI Act to 1000 people on International Right to Information Day. It was indeed a novel way on his part to spread awareness about the Act. The copies of the Act were sent in English, Hindi and Marathi languages. Introducing transparency in the government work is the main purpose of this Act. But even to the lack of awareness in information seeker and information provider, the effective implementation of the said act is badly affected. In 2017 also Mr. Naveen Agrawal had sent 101 applications under RTI Act 2005 to different public authorities seeking information on different issues on International Day of Right to Information with the purpose of creating awareness about the Act.
&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Alasdair S., A Great and Revolutionary Law? The First Four Years of India's Right to Information Act (January 9, 2010). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1527858 Available at SSRN.]&lt;/ref&gt; There have been questions on the lack of speedy appeal to non-compliance to requests. The lack of a central PIO makes it difficult to pin-point the correct PIO to approach for requests. There is also a criticism of the manner in which the Information Commissioners are appointed to head the information commission. It is alleged by RTI Activists that bureaucrats working in close proximity with the government are appointed in the RTI Commissions in a non-transparent manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090528/punjab.htm#2 TribuneIndia.com], Appointment of bureaucrat as Punjab CIC draws flak&lt;/ref&gt; The PIO, being an officer of the relevant Government institution, may have a vested interest in not disclosing damaging information on activities of his/her Institution, This therefore creates a conflict of interest. In the state of Maharashtra it was estimated that only 30% of the requests are actually realised under the Maharashtra Right to Information act. The law does not allow disclosure of information that affects national security, defence, and other matters that are deemed of national interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.filertionline.in|title=File RTI Online - Suchana ka Adhikar - Filing RTI across India|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtiindia.org RTI India]: The Complete Right to Information Portal of India.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rtiact2005.com/ RTI Act, 2005]: RTI Online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://getup4change.org/rti/ GetUp4Change]: Online Community to file RTI applications anonymously.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinerti.com OnlineRTI]: Portal to submit RTI applications online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtination.com RTINation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529073651/http://www.rtination.com/ |date=2012-05-29 }}: Portal to file RTI applications online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a comparison between Indian and British legislative efforts see [http://202.71.128.135:5/bc/focusdetails.asp?ID=19 British Council India's LEGAL eNEWS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927100419/http://202.71.128.135:5/bc/focusdetails.asp?ID=19 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rti.gov.in/rticorner/studybypwc/index-study.htm |title=Study conducted by Pricewaterhouse Cooper for the Department of Personnel and Training in 2008-2009 on the implementation of the RTI Act |publisher=Rti.gov.in |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
The Law on Dissemination of and Free Access to Information was approved by Iranian Parliament in 2008. Its English and Arabic renditions were officially released as part of the government's efforts to promote Freedom of Information (FOI) in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/iran-releases-english-arabic-versions-of-law-on-free-access-to-information/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] the Freedom of Information Act 1997&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997_13.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208023235/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997_13.html |date=February 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; came into effect in April, 1998.  This provided for members of the public to access information specifically about themselves, amend incorrect information, and request an explanation behind administrative decisions concerning themselves, as well as allowing any person to access records generated by a list of specified public bodies. The Act is seen as having led to a sea-change in the relationship between the citizen, journalists, [[Department of state (Ireland)|government departments]] and [[Irish Government#Public sector|public bodies]]. Disclosure is the default assumption of the Act; bodies can withhold information only by citing exemptions specified in the legislation. Decisions of public bodies in relation to requests for information may be reviewed by the [[Information Commissioner]].

The Act was subsequently amended by the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0009/index.html|title=Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003|publisher=IrishStatuteBook.ie|date=2003-04-11|accessdate=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendments introduced fees for non-personal requests and restricted the kinds of material which could be accessed.

On 14 October 2014, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150929002113/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0030/ Freedom of Information Act 2014] repealed the 1997 and 2003 Acts, removing most of the restrictions introduced in 2003 and widened the range of bodies covered to all public bodies, unless specifically exempt. It also allowed for the Government to prescribe (or designate) other bodies receiving significant public funds, so that the FOI legislation applies to them also.

One particular controversy which has caused concern to journalists and historians is that traditionally government ministers would annotate and sign any major policy or report documents which they had seen. However this practice has fallen out of favour because of the new openness. This annotation and signing of documents has often given a [[paper trail]] and unique insight as to "what the minister knew" about a controversy or how he or she formed an opinion on a matter. Also civil and public servants have become more informal, in keeping written records of potentially controversial meeting and avoiding writing memos as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=9&amp;si=1583676&amp;issue_id=13822 |title=Harney accused over 'new culture of secrecy' in Health - National News, Frontpage - Independent.ie |publisher=Unison.ie |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this information would not often be released, and sometimes only under the [[thirty year rule]], the fact that government ministers now do not annotate and sign documents creates the concerns that while government is open it is not accountable as to who did or saw what or how decision making process works.

===Israel===
In [[Israel]], the Freedom of Information Law, 5758-1998, supported by the Freedom of Information Regulations, 5759-1999, controls freedom of information. It defines the bodies subject to the legislation by a set of listed categories - essentially, most public bodies - and provides for the government to publish a list of all affected bodies. However, this list does not seem to have been made publicly available, if indeed it was ever compiled.{{POV check inline|date=November 2011}} Many public bodies are not obliged to follow the law, which limits the potential for use by the public.

The Israeli Freedom of Information Law has, in some cases, actually achieved the opposite intended result.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} some Government agencies now take the position that a citizen may only request information via FOIL—i.e., an official letter designated as such and including the 95 [[Israeli new shekel|shekel]] fee. Thus an Israeli citizen in many cases cannot simply write a letter asking a question, and can be asked to file a FOIL application with a fee and wait the minimum statutory 30 days for a reply, which the agency can extend to 60 days. In many cases FOIL letters are simply ignored,{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} or some laconic response is sent stating the request is either unclear, unspecific, too vague or some other legalese, anything in order to keep the information away from the public.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} When the 60 days are up, if the anticipated result usually yield nothing significant,{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} the applicant must petition the District Court to compel disclosure, a procedure that requires attorneys to draft pleadings and a payment of (approximately) $420 court fee. A judgement in such FOIL appeals in Israel can take many months, and again the agency can easily{{POV statement|date=September 2011}} avoid disclosure by simply not complying, although risking being charged with contempt of court. While there are some successes in courts compelling Israeli government agencies to disclose information, they are usually in non-controversial areas. The law provides for the expected{{POV check inline|date=November 2011}} "security" exemption and an applicant applying for such information can expect not to benefit from FOIL (and also have his or her court appeal rejected). it will be noted that Applicants can sometimes be helped by [[The Movement for Freedom of Information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meida.org.il |title=Meida.org.il |publisher=Meida.org.il |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
Chapter V of Law No. 241 of 7 August 1990 provides for access to administrative documents. However, the right to access is limited. The law states that those requesting information must have a legal interest. The 1992 regulations require "a personal concrete interest to safeguard in legally relevant situations." The courts have ruled that this includes the right of environmental groups and local councilors to demand information on behalf of those they represent. It was amended in 2005. The revision appears to adopt the court rulings and relax the interest somewhat to allow access when an individual can show they represent a more general public interest.

===Jamaica===
In Jamaica, the relevant legislation is the '''Access to Information Act, 2002'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Access to Information Unit Jamaica Archives &amp; Records Department|title=The Access to Information Act 2002|url=http://www.ati.gov.jm/sites/default/files/Documents/atiact_0.pdf|website=ati.gov.jm/content/access-information-act|publisher=Government of Jamaica|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In [[Japan]], the "Law Concerning Access to Information Held by Administrative Organs" (行政機関の保有する情報の公開に関する法律) was promulgated in 1999. The law was enforced in 2001.

In many local governments, it establishes the regulations about information disclosure (情報公開条例) from the latter half of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecommunications (総務省) [http://www.soumu.go.jp/gyoukan/kanri/translation3.htm Law Concerning Access to Information Held by Administrative Organs] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130219011722/http://www.soumu.go.jp/gyoukan/kanri/translation3.htm |date=2013-02-19 }}, [https://web.archive.org/web/20010423185834/http://www.soumu.go.jp/gyoukan/kanri/mainpoint1.htm Main Points of the Law Concerning Access to Information Held by Administrative Organs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;/IRON&gt;--&gt;

===Latvia===
The Constitution of Latvia states: "Article 100. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression, which includes the right to freely receive, keep and distribute information and to express his or her views. Censorship is prohibited." The right to access state held information has been repeatedly recognised by the Constitutional Court of Latvia, most notably in its judgment "On Conformity of the Cabinet of Ministers 21 January 1997 Regulations No.46 "On Government Agreements" with the 20 November 1998 "Information Accessibility Law"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/?lang=2&amp;mid=19 |title=Constitutional Court of the Republic of Latvia |publisher=Satv.tiesa.gov.lv |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judgment 04-02(99)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law on Freedom of Information was signed into law by the State President in November 1998 and has been amended a number of times recently. Any person can ask for information in "any technically feasible form" without having to show a reason. The request can be oral or written. Bodies must respond in 15 days.

===Malta===
On the 1st of September 2012, Legal Notice 156 of 2012 brought the Freedom of Information Act (Chapter 496 of the Laws of Malta) fully into force, allowing the public (resident citizens of Malta, the EU and the EEA) to submit requests for documents/information held by the Government. FOI requests are submitted free of charge but processing of documents by public authorities may require the public to pay fees which never exceed Eur 40. When access to documents is refused, the FOIA in Malta provides for a complaint and appeal mechanism that can be ultimately resolved through the Courts of Appeal.

===Liberia===
President [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] signed the Freedom of Information Act of 2010 into law in October 2010. [[Liberia]] became only the fourth country in [[Africa]], and the first in [[West Africa]], to pass such legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liberianobserver.com/node/8622|title=Ellen Signs "Freedom of Information Act" into Law|newspaper=Daily Observer|date=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law allows both the media and individual citizens to demand information from any public authority or any private authority that carries out government functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201010111890.html|title=Liberian President Signs Freedom of Information Act Into Law|newspaper=allAfrica.com|date=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Macedonia===
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=February 2017}}

{{Main|Access to public information in the Republic of Macedonia}}

Article 16 of the Constitution of Macedonia guarantees "access to information and the freedom of reception and transmission of information".

The Law on Free Access to Information of Public Character was adopted on 25 January 2006. It is scheduled to go into force in September 2006.The law allows any natural or legal person to obtain information from state and municipal bodies and natural and legal persons who are performing public functions. The requests can be oral, written or electronic. Requests must be responded to in 10 days.

===Malaysia===
The state of [[Selangor]] passed the Freedom of Information Enactment (Selangor) 2010 on 1 April 2011, allowing the Malaysian public an access to the state documents including that of local councils, city halls and state government-linked companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/selangor-passes-freedom-of-information-enactment/|title=Selangor passes Freedom of Information Enactment|accessdate=1 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404002324/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/selangor-passes-freedom-of-information-enactment/|archivedate=4 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the state of [[Penang]] passed the Freedom of Information bill on 4 November 2011, allowing the public to access to state documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/11/4/nation/20111104200415&amp;sec=nation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106202826/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2011%2F11%2F4%2Fnation%2F20111104200415&amp;sec=nation|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 November 2011|title=Penang passes Freedom of Information Bill|accessdate=5 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both states are under the ruling of the federal opposition [[Pakatan Rakyat]].

===Mexico===
The Constitution was amended in 1977 to include a right of freedom of information. Article 6 says in part, "the right of information shall be guaranteed by the state." The Supreme Court made a number of decisions further enhancing that right.

The Federal Law of Transparency and Access to Public Government Information was unanimously approved by Congress in April 2002 and signed by President Fox in June 2002. It went into effect in June 2003.

===Montenegro===
{{main|Access to public information in Montenegro}}
A freedom of information law was passed in Montenegro late in 2005, after a process of several years.

===Netherlands===
Article 110 of the Constitution states: "In the exercise of their duties government bodies shall observe the principle of transparency in accordance with the rules to be prescribed by Act of Parliament."

The Dutch act on public access to government information entered into force in 1980 and is updated several times later. Under the act known as the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Wet Openbaarheid van Bestuur|nl|3=Openbaarheid van bestuur#Nederland}}'', or ''Wob'' for short, any person can demand information (called ''wobbing'') related to an administrative matter if it is contained in documents held by public authorities or companies carrying out work for a public authority. The request can either be written or oral. The authority has two (on environmental issues) or four weeks to respond. The act also obliges the government to provide information ''unsolicited'' as it is in the interest of good and democratic governance.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the relevant legislation is the [[Official Information Act 1982]]. This implemented a general policy of openness regarding official documents and replaced the Official Secrets Act.

===Nigeria===
Former President [[Goodluck Jonathan]] signed into law the Freedom of Information (FoI) Bill, awaited for 12 years by media proprietors and practitioners alike, during which the Villa got knocks for filibustering and lawmakers complained of bombardment by campaigners.

The House of Representatives passed the Bill on February 24, 2011 and the Senate dialled up integrity on March 16 as it delivered on promise to pass it.

The harmonised version was passed by both Chambers on May 26, 2011.It was conveyed to Jonathan on May 27, and he signed it on '''May 28, 2011''', according to a statement Aso Rock issued on Tuesday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://independentngonline.com/DailyIndependent/Article.aspx?id=34777|title=Jonathan signs FoI Bill|newspaper=Daily Independence|date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two states in Nigeria (namely Ekiti and Lagos State) have adopted the Freedom of Information Act at State level but they have extended the response date at State level from 7 days to 14 days. More states are expected to adopt the bill and come up with their own version.

===Pakistan===
{{main|Freedom of Information Act in Pakistan}}
President [[Pervez Musharraf]] promulgated the Freedom of Information Ordinance 2002 in October 2002.&lt;ref name=foi2002&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom of Information Ordinance promulgated|url=http://www.transparency.org.pk/documents/FIO.pdf|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=12 April 2013|date=27 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law allows any citizen access to public records held by a public body of the federal government including ministries, departments, boards, councils, courts and tribunals. It does not apply to government owned corporations or provincial governments. The bodies must respond within 21 days.

More recently, by virtue of the 18th Amendment of 2010, article 19A has been inserted in the [[Constitution of Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=constit20&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution of Pakistan|url=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part2.ch1.html|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gives the right to access to information the status of a fundamental constitutional right. Article 19A "Right to Information" reads: "Every citizen shall have the right to have access to information in all matters of public importance subject to regulation and reasonable restrictions imposed by law".

===Paraguay===
The National Constitution of [[Paraguay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Paraguay_2011.pdf|title = Constitution of Paraguay|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; enacted in 1992, guarantees the right to be informed and to receive true, responsible, and equitable information (Art. 28). The same article states that public sources of information are free, and that a law will regulate the modalities, time periods, and sanctions “in order to make this right effective”.  In practice, this last provision delayed the recognition of the right due to the absence of a law making it “effective”. Congress, government agencies and Courts were reluctant to enforce the right to access public sources of information until 2013. A Supreme Court judgment (No. 1306 of 15 October 2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.pj.gov.py/descargas/AYS-1306.pdf|title = Acción de Inconstitucionalidad en el juicio "Defensoria del Pueblo c/ Municipalidad de San Lorenzo".|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; marked the beginning of what has been called a “Transparency Spring&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.ultimahora.com/la-primavera-la-transparencia-n934443.html|title = La Primavera Transparente|last = |first = |date = |work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;”.

The ruling from the Supreme Court was made in the context of an [[Recurso de amparo|Amparo]] filed by a citizen called Jose Daniel Vargas Tellez, after the San Lorenzo Municipality denied him access to the information about the names, the job descriptions and the wages of all the employees that were working in that public office.  The Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeals rejected the Amparo on the grounds that information of that type was considered sensitive by the Data Protection and Privacy Act (Law 1682/02 and 1969/02). The latter rulings were challenged on constitutional grounds and the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Vargas Tellez holding that while this information relating to the identity and wages of public employees and officers constitutes personal propriety data, it is nonetheless registered in a “public source of information”, which makes it available to any citizen who requests it. The right to access to these informations is recognised under the Constitution and international instruments such as the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] (Art. 13); The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (Art. 19); and the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]] (Art. 13).

Following the Supreme Court's decision, and with the support of the civil society and President [[Horacio Cartes]], the first Transparency law was enacted (Law No. 5189/14) requiring all public offices to disclose information regarding the use of public funds to pay salaries. In addition, The Freedom of Information and Government Transparency Law (Law 5282/2014) was enacted in 2014 and a final regulation of 2015 (Executive Decree 4064/15) set the final step in the road to Transparency. These rules expressly recognize that the right to access public information is a human right, which improves the State, promotes citizen participation and public accountability, and serves as a tool to combat corruption. Currently, all requests to access public information can be done [http://informacionpublica.paraguay.gov.py/portal/#!/buscar_informacion#busqueda online] through a single portal, and government offices are obliged to respond within 15 days.

Paraguay became internationally committed to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance after becoming a member of the [[Open Government Partnership]]. Presently, most government offices have [http://www.pj.gov.py/contenido/1298-acceso-a-la-informacion-publica-y-transparencia-gubernamental/1298 Transparency offices] and can provide information to citizens and receive reports of corruption. The main Executive agency in charge of promoting Electronic Government is the [http://www.senatics.gov.py SENATICS.]

'''Rectification, Clarification and Destruction of False or Distorted information:'''

Art 28 of the Constitution also states that any person affected by the diffusion of a false, distorted, or ambiguous information has the right to demand its rectification or its clarification by the same means and under the same conditions in which it was divulged, without prejudice to the other compensatory rights. There is also a specific law that regulates [[Habeas data|Habeas Data]], and any citizen can request a copy of publicly or privately held information relating to him, and can demand that any inaccurate data found be destroyed.

===Serbia===
{{main|Access to public information in Serbia}}
In Serbia, the '''Access to Public Information Act''' gives access to documents of public authorities.

===Slovakia===
Slovakia passed the Freedom of Information Act in May 2000 (Num. law: 211/2000 Z. z.). Under the law, everybody can demand information from state institutions, organisations, from municipalities, individuals and legal entities financed by the public budget.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.sk/UserControls/l2/211_2000.htm Zakon o slobodnom pristupe k informaciam] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619162008/http://www.justice.gov.sk/UserControls/l2/211_2000.htm |date=June 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slovenia===
{{Main|Access to public information in Slovenia}}
Slovenia passed the Access to Public Information Act in March 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dostopdoinformacij.si/index.php?id=253#236|title=Dostop do Informacij|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2016}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act governs the procedure which ensures everyone free access to public information held by state bodies, local government bodies, public agencies, public funds and other entities of public law, public powers holders and public service contractors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20050308120743/http://www.accesstoinformation.si/ AccessToInformation.si], Commissioner's site&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
{{main|Promotion of Access to Information Act, 2000}}
Section 32 of the [[Constitution of South Africa]] guarantees "the right of access to any information held by the state; and any information that is held by another person and that is required for the exercise or protection of any rights." This right is implemented through the Promotion of Access to Information Act, which was enacted on 2 February 2000. The right of access to ''privately'' held information is an interesting feature, as most freedom of information laws only cover governmental bodies.

===South Korea===
The Constitutional Court ruled in 1989 that there is a constitutional right to information "as an aspect of the right of freedom of expression and specific implementing legislation to define the contours of the right was not a prerequisite to its enforcement."

The Act on Disclosure of Information by Public Agencies was enacted in 1996 and went into effect in January 1998. It allows citizens to demand information held by public agencies.

===Sri Lanka===
Sri Lanka's [http://www.parliament.lk/uploads/acts/gbills/english/6007.pdf Right to Information Act No 12 of 2016 ] was certified on 4 August 2016. After much debate and many amendments to the draft Bill, the final Act comprising 44 Sections was certified in early August 2016. The implementation of the Act is expected to take time due to the necessity of establishing cadre positions in government institutions to provide information to the general public. The Act is considered to hold many strengths and positive features that would effectively authorize citizens to be actively involved in the process of governance. Moreover, Article 14A(1) introduced by virtue of  [http://slembassyusa.org/downloads/19th_Amendment_E.pdf 19th Amendment to the 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka] has paved the way for the recognition of right to information as a fundamental right.

===Sweden===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Zenon Panoussis]] --&gt;
In [[Sweden]], the [[Freedom of the Press Act]] grants public access to official documents and is included in the [[Constitution of Sweden#Principle of Public Access|Constitution of Sweden]]. Dating back to 1766, it is the first freedom of information legislation in the modern sense. In modern times the right has become known as the Principle of Public Access ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''offentlighetsprincipen'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.government.se/how-sweden-is-governed/the-principle-of-public-access-to-official-documents/|title=The Principle of Public Access to Official Documents|publisher=Sweden.gov.se |date= |accessdate=2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Principle of Public Access means that the general public is guaranteed insight into activities pursued by government agencies. All official documents handled by government agencies are public unless they contain information specified as secret under the [[Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act]]. Each request to take part of official documents is handled individually and classifying documents or information as secret is subject to appeal. The constitution also grants the right for government employees to pass on information without risk of criminal charges or repercussions and the right to attend court proceedings and meetings of legislative assemblies like the [[Riksdag]].

===Switzerland===
Switzerland is a federal state. Access to federal documents is governed by the Swiss Federal Act on the Principle of Freedom of Information in Public Administration, and supervised by the [[Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/20022540/index.html Federal Act on Freedom of Information in the Administration of 17 December 2004 (status as of 19 August 2014)], [[Federal Chancellery of Switzerland]] (page visited on 19 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Access to documents at the [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantonal level]] is governed by cantonal laws, which are mostly similar to the federal law.
As of 2018, the cantons of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]], [[Glarus]], [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]], [[Nidwalden]], [[Obwalden]] and [[Thurgau]] do not have freedom of information legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Öffentlichkeitsgesetz.ch: Die Kantone |url=https://www.oeffentlichkeitsgesetz.ch/deutsch/die-kantone/ |website=oeffentlichkeitsgesetz.ch |accessdate=21 October 2018 |language=de-CH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Access to public information in Ukraine}}

The 1996 [[Constitution of Ukraine|Constitution]] does not include a specific general right of access to information but contains a general right of freedom of collect and disseminate information and rights of access to personal and environmental information.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Freedom of information in the United Kingdom}}

The [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] (2000 c. 36) is the implementation of freedom of information legislation in the [[United Kingdom]] on a national level, with the exception of Scottish bodies, which are covered by the [[Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002]] (2002 asp. 13). Environmental information is covered by further legislation [[Environmental Information Regulations 2004]]. [[Tony Blair]], the UK Prime Minister who introduced the Freedom of Information Act, later expressed regret over the Act, claiming that the Act impeded the ability of officials to deliberate "with a reasonable level of confidentiality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/opensecrets/2010/09/why_tony_blair_thinks_he_was_a.html|title=Why Tony Blair thinks he was an idiot|last=Rosenbaum|first=Martin|date=1 September 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Freedom of information in the United States}}

In the United States the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] was signed into law by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on July 4, 1966 and went into effect the following year. [[Ralph Nader]] has been credited with the impetus for creating this act, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Henriette Mantel, Steve Skrovan (directors)|year=2006|title=An Unreasonable Man|medium=motion picture |url=http://anunreasonableman.com/|publisher=Genius Entertainment|isbn=9781594445965|oclc=138363823}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments were signed by President [[Bill Clinton]] on October 2, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oct. 2, 1996: FOIA Law Ushers in Digital Democracy|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/10/1002electronic-foia/|website=wired.com|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act applies only to [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agencies]]. However, all of the states, as well as the District of Columbia and some territories, have enacted similar statutes to require disclosures by agencies of the state and of local governments, though some are significantly broader than others. Some state and local government agencies attempt to get around state open records laws by claiming copyright for their works and then demanding high fees to license the public information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petersen|first=Barbara A.|title=Copyright and State Government: An Analysis of Section 119.083, Florida's Software Copyright Provision|journal=Florida State University Law Review|volume=20|issue=2|pages=441–486|year=1992|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/flsulr20&amp;div=22&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|441–42}} Some states expand government transparency through [[Freedom of information in the United States|open meeting laws]], which require government meetings to be announced in advance and held publicly.

===Uruguay===
The Act was enacted in 2008 under President Vazquez's Administration and is mainly implemented by the Judiciary.

===Zimbabwe===
In [[Zimbabwe]], the [[Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Zimbabwe)|Access to Information and Privacy Act (AIPPA)]] was signed by their President [[Robert Mugabe]] in February 2002.

In an FBI Intelligence Assessment from 2006, the [[FBI Counterterrorism Division]] provides an overview of white supremacist infiltration of law enforcement and mentions that use of the term came to the agency's attention in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=FBI Counterterrorism Division|title=White Supremacist Infiltration of Law Enforcement|url=http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/402521/doc-26-white-supremacist-infiltration.pdf|accessdate=31 January 2017|date=17 October 2006|quote=(U/LES) Since coming to law enforcement attention in late 2004, the term ''ghost skins'' has gained currency among white supremacists to describe those who avoid overt display of their beliefs to blend into society and covertly advance white supremacist causes. One internet posting described this effort as a form of role-playing in which "to create the character, you must get inside the mind of the person you are trying to duplicate."* Such role playing has an application to ad-hoc and organized law enforcement infiltration. At least one white supremacist group has reportedly encouraged ghost skins to seek positions in law enforcement for the capability of alerting skinhead crews of pending investigative action against them.&lt;br/&gt;(U/LES) Leaders in the white supremacist movement have advocated confronting suspected infiltrators and to instruct them to provide their FBI handlers with low level information that will minimally impact the group's activities. Another as yet undocumented infiltration strategy is for members to "walk in" to law enforcement agencies and offer information to determine an agency's interest in the organization.&lt;br/&gt;*(U) http://www.nukeisrael.com/ghost%20skin.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ghost Aryan Skin Warrior|url=http://nukeisrael.com/ghost%20skin.htm|accessdate=31 January 2017|date=4 February 2005|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204162439/http://nukeisrael.com/ghost%20skin.htm|archivedate=4 February 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FBI report on Police infiltration ...

{{italic title}}
'''''Grapefruit''''' is an [[artist's book]] written by [[Yoko Ono]], originally published in 1964. It has become famous as an early example of [[conceptual art]], containing a series of "[[event score]]s" that replace the physical work of art – the traditional stock-in-trade of artists – with instructions that an individual may, or may not, wish to enact.

{{quote|''Grapefruit'' is one of the monuments of conceptual art of the early 1960s. She has a lyrical, poetic dimension that sets her apart from the other conceptual artists. Her approach to art was only made acceptable when white men like [[Joseph Kosuth|Kosuth]] and [[Lawrence Weiner|Weiner]] came in and did virtually the same thing as Yoko, but made them respectable and collectible.|{{Interlanguage link multi|David Bourdon|de}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|David Bourdon|de}} quoted in ''[[New York Times]]'' 1989, reproduced in ''Yes. Yoko Ono'', [[Harry Abrams]] 2000, p26&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Origins of the event score==
{{See also|Fluxus#Event score}}
Event scores were developed by a number of artists attending [[John Cage]]'s experimental music composition classes at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York. Whilst Ono did not attend these informal lessons, her husband at the time, Ichiyanagi Toshi (an experimental musician), did and Toshi and Ono became regulars of Cage's circle of friends by 1959. Other members of this group included [[David Tudor]], [[Morton Feldman]], [[Richard Maxfield]] and [[Merce Cunningham]]. Invention of the event score is usually credited to [[George Brecht]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_8_44/ai_n18764245/pg_2 Quoted in George Brecht, by Yve-Alain Bois]&lt;/ref&gt; but [[La Monte Young]] and Yoko Ono are also cited as amongst the first to experiment with the form.&lt;ref&gt;Yes. Yoko Ono, Harry Abrams 2000, p18&lt;/ref&gt; Both Cage and Brecht were deeply influenced by "Oriental thinking",&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.chello.nl/j.seegers1/flux_files/brecht.html George Brecht]&lt;/ref&gt; and Ono found that her Buddhist-inspired work was, almost accidentally, fêted by the emerging New York [[counterculture]] as [[avant-garde]].

{{quote|Event Scores, involve simple actions, ideas, and objects from everyday life recontexualized as performance. Event Scores are texts that can be seen as proposal pieces or instructions for actions. The idea of the score suggests musicality. Like a musical score, Event Scores can be realized by artists other than the original creator and are open to variation and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aknowles.com/eventscore.html Alison Knowles website]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Origins of the book==
Often considered a [[Fluxus]] artwork, in fact the work was originally published by Ono's own imprint, Wunternaum Press, in [[Tokyo]] in an edition of 500. After leaving New York in 1962 – where she had exhibited at Maciunas' AG Gallery, amongst others – her then-husband Anthony Cox suggested she collect her scores together. [[George Maciunas]], the central personality in Fluxus, had apparently been trying to reach her in Tokyo with the aim of printing a similar book in New York,&lt;ref name="Yes. Yoko Ono 2000, p82"&gt;Yes. Yoko Ono, Harry Abrams 2000, p82&lt;/ref&gt; as part of his series of ''Fluxkits'' (see ''[[Water Yam (artist's book)|Water Yam]]''),&lt;ref&gt;Other artists he intended to compile included [[Daniel Spoerri]], [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Dick Higgins]] and [[La Monte Young]]&lt;/ref&gt; but his letters had not reached her; she sent some of the scores and a prepublication advertisement to be published in his Fluxus newspaper in February 1964 when contact was finally established.

===First edition===
The name ''Grapefruit'' was chosen as title because Ono believed the [[grapefruit]] to be a hybrid of an [[orange (fruit)|orange]] and a [[lemon]], and thus a reflection of herself as "a spiritual hybrid".&lt;ref name="Yes. Yoko Ono 2000, p82"/&gt; It also seems likely that it is a playful allusion to Brecht's ''[[Water Yam (artist's book)|Water Yam]]'', itself a pun on Brecht and Watt's ''Yam Festival'', which, culminating in a series of events and performances in May 1963, had been derived from "May" backwards.

The first edition that was published in 1964 in Japan by Wunternaum Press created by Yoko Ono, contains over 150 "instruction works"; virtually all are in English, with about a third translated into Japanese. They are divided into five sections; ''Music'', ''Painting'', ''Event'', ''Poetry'' and ''Object''. The instructions are preceded by dedications to figures including [[John Cage]], [[La Monte Young]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Isamu Noguchi]] and [[Peggy Guggenheim]], and also includes documentation relating to Ono's recent exhibitions and performances.&lt;ref name="Yes. Yoko Ono 2000, p82"/&gt; The work was originally sold for $3.00 before publication, $6.00 after.

===Subsequent editions===
The second edition was published in 1970 by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in New York, Peter Owen Ltd in [[London]], and Bärmeier &amp; Nikel in [[Frankfurt]]. As well as an introduction by [[John Lennon]] ("Hi! My name is John Lennon. I'd like you to meet Yoko Ono ..."&lt;ref&gt;''Grapefruit'' (1970 reissue)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000 reissue of Lennon's book, ''[[In His Own Write]]'', Ono wrote a similar introduction), the work contained 80 more instruction pieces, and included two more sections, ''Film'' and ''Dance''. The book ends with a collection of Ono's writings including ''To The Wesleyan People'', 1966.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.a-i-u.net/yokosays.html&lt;/ref&gt; There were also paperback versions printed by Sphere and Touchstone around the same time, and a reprint by Simon &amp; Schuster in 2000. The sphere edition has a particularly memorable sleeve, conflating the title with Yoko Ono's film ''Bottoms'', (or no. 4), a film composed exclusively of naked bottoms, made in 1966.

{{Irreligion sidebar|atheism}}
[[Atheism]] (derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] [[:wikt:ἄθεος|ἄθεος]] ''atheos'' meaning "without gods; godless; secular; denying or disdaining the gods, especially officially sanctioned gods"&lt;ref&gt;Modern translations of classical texts sometimes translate ''atheos'' as "atheistic". As an abstract noun, there was also ''atheotēs'' ("atheism").&lt;/ref&gt;) is the absence or rejection of the belief that [[Deity|deities]] exist. The English term was used at least as early as the sixteenth century and atheistic ideas and their influence have a longer history. Over the centuries, atheists have supported their lack of belief in gods through a variety of avenues, including scientific, philosophical, and ideological notions.

In the East, a contemplative life not centered on the idea of deities began in the sixth century BCE with the rise of [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]], and various [[atheism in Hinduism|sects]] of [[Hinduism]] in India, and of [[Taoism]] in China. Within the [[astika]] ("orthodox") schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], the [[Samkhya]] and the early [[Mimamsa]] school did not accept a [[creator deity]] in their respective systems. The [[Vedas]] of [[Ceylon]] admitted only the possibility that deities might exist but went no further. Neither prayers nor sacrifices were suggested in any way by the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/storyofcivilizat035369mbp/storyofcivilizat035369mbp_djvu.txt The Story of Civilization]; [[Will Durant]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical atheist thought began to appear in Europe and Asia in the sixth or fifth century BCE. [[Will Durant]], in his ''[[The Story of Civilization]]'', explained that certain [[pygmy]] tribes found in Africa were observed to have no identifiable cults or rites. There were no totems, no deities, and no spirits. Their dead were buried without special ceremonies or accompanying items and received no further attention. They even appeared to lack simple superstitions, according to travelers' reports.

==Indian philosophy==
{{Main|Atheism in Hinduism}}
In the East, a contemplative life not centered on the idea of deities began in the sixth century BCE with the rise of [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]], and  [[atheism in Hinduism|various sects]] of [[Hinduism]] in India, and of [[Taoism]] in China.  These religions offered a philosophic and salvific path not involving deity worship. Deities are not seen as necessary to the salvific goal of the early Buddhist tradition, their reality is explicitly questioned and often rejected. There is a fundamental incompatibility between the notion of gods and basic Buddhist principles, at least in some interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Buddhist Attitude to God|url=http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebdha068.htm|website=budsas|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[astika]] ("orthodox") schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], the [[Samkhya]] and the early [[Mimamsa]] school did not accept a creator-deity in their respective systems.

The principal text of the [[Samkhya]] school, the ''[[Samkhya Karika]]'', was written by [[Ishvara Krishna]] in the fourth century CE, by which time it was already a dominant Hindu school. The origins of the school are much older and are lost in legend. The school was both dualistic and atheistic. They believed in a dual existence of [[Prakriti]] ("nature") and [[Purusha]] ("spirit") and had no place for an [[Ishvara]] ("God") in its system, arguing that the existence of Ishvara cannot be proved and hence cannot be admitted to exist. The school dominated Hindu philosophy in its day, but declined after the tenth century, although commentaries were still being written as late as the sixteenth century.

The foundational text for the Mimamsa school is the ''[[Purva Mimamsa Sutras]]'' of [[Jaimini]] (c. third to first century BCE). The school reached its height c. 700 CE, and for some time in the [[Early Middle Ages]] exerted near-dominant influence on learned Hindu thought. The Mimamsa school saw their primary enquiry was into the nature of [[dharma]] based on close interpretation of the [[Vedas]]. Its core tenets were [[ritual]]ism ([[orthopraxy]]), antiasceticism and antimysticism. The early Mimamsakas believed in an ''[[adrishta]]'' ("unseen") that is the result of performing [[karmas]] ("works") and saw no need for an [[Ishvara]] ("God") in their system. Mimamsa persists in some subschools of Hinduism today.

===Cārvāka===
The thoroughly [[Materialism|materialistic]] and antireligious philosophical [[Cārvāka]] school that originated in [[India]] with the [[Bārhaspatya-sūtras]] (final centuries BCE) is probably the most explicitly atheist school of philosophy in the region. The school grew out of the generic skepticism in the [[Mauryan period]]. Already in the sixth century BCE, [[Ajita Kesakambalin]], was quoted in Pali scriptures by the Buddhists with whom he was debating, teaching that "with the break-up of the body, the wise and the foolish alike are annihilated, destroyed. They do not exist after death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cārvākan philosophy is now known principally from its [[Astika]] and [[Buddhist]] opponents. The proper aim of a Cārvākan, according to these sources, was to live a prosperous, happy, productive life in this world. The ''Tattvopaplavasimha'' of [[Jayarashi Bhatta]] (c. 8th century) is sometimes cited as a surviving Carvaka text. The school appears to have died out sometime around the fifteenth century.

===Buddhism===
{{Main|God in Buddhism|Buddhist cosmology}}
The nonadherence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhikku|first=Thanissaro|title=Tittha Sutta: Sectarians|year=1997|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.061.than.html |authorlink=Anguttara Nikaya, 3.61|language=English|quote=Then in that case, a person is a killer of living beings because of a supreme being's act of creation... When one falls back on lack of cause and lack of condition as being essential, monks, there is no desire, no effort [at the thought], 'This should be done. This shouldn't be done.' When one can't pin down as a truth or reality what should &amp; shouldn't be done, one dwells bewildered &amp; unprotected. One cannot righteously refer to oneself as a contemplative.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the notion of a [[God|supreme deity]] or a [[Primum movens|prime mover]] is seen by many as a key distinction between [[Buddhism]] and other religions. While Buddhist traditions do not deny the existence of supernatural beings (many are discussed in [[Buddhist scripture]]), it does not ascribe powers, in the typical Western sense, for creation, salvation or judgement, to the "gods", however, praying to enlightened deities is sometimes seen as leading to some degree of spiritual merit.

Buddhists accept the existence of beings in higher realms, known as [[Deva (Buddhism)|''devas'']], but they, like humans, are said to be suffering in ''[[Samsara (Buddhism)|samsara]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Thirty-one planes of Existence|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sagga/loka.html|publisher=Access To Insight|accessdate=26 May 2010|author=John T Bullitt|year=2005|quote=The suttas describe thirty-one distinct "planes" or "realms" of existence into which beings can be reborn during this long wandering through samsara. These range from the extraordinarily dark, grim, and painful hell realms all the way up to the most sublime, refined, and exquisitely blissful heaven realms. Existence in every realm is impermanent; in Buddhist cosmology there is no eternal heaven or hell. Beings are born into a particular realm according to both their past kamma and their kamma at the moment of death. When the kammic force that propelled them to that realm is finally exhausted, they pass away, taking rebirth once again elsewhere according to their kamma. And so the wearisome cycle continues.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not particularly wiser than we are. In fact the Buddha is often portrayed as a teacher of the deities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Teacher of the Devas |year=1997 |publisher=Buddhist Publication Society |url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html |author=Susan Elbaum Jootla |editor=Access To Insight |location=Kandy, Sri Lanka |chapter=II. The Buddha Teaches Deities |quote="Many people worship Maha Brahma as the supreme and eternal creator God, but for the Buddha he is merely a powerful deity still caught within the cycle of repeated existence. In point of fact, "Maha Brahma" is a role or office filled by different individuals at different periods.", "His proof included the fact that "many thousands of deities have gone for refuge for life to the recluse Gotama" (MN 95.9). Devas, like humans, develop faith in the Buddha by practicing his teachings.", "A second deva concerned with liberation spoke a verse which is partly praise of the Buddha and partly a request for teaching. Using various similes from the animal world, this god showed his admiration and reverence for the Exalted One.", "A discourse called Sakka's Questions (DN 21) took place after he had been a serious disciple of the Buddha for some time. The sutta records a long audience he had with the Blessed One which culminated in his attainment of stream-entry. Their conversation is an excellent example of the Buddha as "teacher of devas," and shows all beings how to work for Nibbana." |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204142247/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html |archivedate=4 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and superior to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhikku|first=Thanissaro|title=Kevaddha Sutta|year=1997|publisher=Access To Insight|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.11.0.than.html#bigbrahma|authorlink=Digha Nikaya, 11|quote=When this was said, the Great Brahma said to the monk, 'I, monk, am Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be... That is why I did not say in their presence that I, too, don't know where the four great elements... cease without remainder. So you have acted wrongly, acted incorrectly, in bypassing the Blessed One in search of an answer to this question elsewhere. Go right back to the Blessed One and, on arrival, ask him this question. However, he answers it, you should take it to heart.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this they do have some enlightened Devas in the path of buddhahood.

===Jainism===
{{See also|Jainism and non-creationism}}
Jains see their tradition as eternal. Organized [[Jainism]] can be dated back to [[Parshva]] who lived in the ninth century BCE, and, more reliably, to [[Mahavira]], a teacher of the sixth century BCE, and a contemporary of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. Jainism is a dualistic religion with the [[universe]] made up of [[matter]] and [[souls]]. The universe, and the matter and souls within it, is eternal and uncreated, and there is no omnipotent creator deity in Jainism. There are, however, "gods" and other spirits who exist within the universe and Jains believe that the soul can attain "godhood"; however, none of these supernatural beings exercise any sort of creative activity or have the capacity or ability to intervene in answers to prayers.

==Classical Greece and Rome==
[[File:socrates.png|thumb|150px|right|[[Socrates]]]]
In Western [[classical Antiquity]], theism was the fundamental belief that supported the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the state (the ''[[polis]]'', later the [[Roman Empire]]). Historically, any person who did not believe in any deity supported by the state was fair game to accusations of atheism, a [[Capital punishment|capital crime]]. For political reasons, [[Socrates]] in Athens (399 BCE) was accused of being ''atheos'' ("refusing to acknowledge the gods recognized by the state").&lt;ref&gt;Tim Whitmarsh, ''Battling the Gods: Atheism in the Ancient World''. New York 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians in Rome were also considered subversive to the state religion and persecuted as atheists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pablo|first=Martin|title=Remaining Catholic: Six Good Reasons for Staying in an Imperfect Church|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S1IL-xz8VrwC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=Christians+in+Rome+were+also+considered+subversive+to+the+state+religion+and+persecuted+as+atheists&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JdWKIatguj&amp;sig=sS6MJUymBI5ogayP5fsEdNDAN6g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s1o_U6vDD_bLsQT38oLABQ&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Christians%20in%20Rome%20were%20also%20considered%20subversive%20to%20the%20state%20religion%20and%20persecuted%20as%20atheists&amp;f=false|work=p. 41|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, charges of atheism, meaning the subversion of religion, were often used similarly to charges of [[heresy]] and [[impiety]] as a political tool to eliminate enemies.

===Presocratic philosophy===
The roots of [[Western philosophy]] began in the Greek world in the sixth century BCE. The first Hellenic philosophers were not atheists, but they attempted to explain the world in terms of the processes of nature instead of by mythological accounts. Thus [[lightning]] was the result of "wind breaking out and parting the clouds",&lt;ref&gt;[[Anaximander]], ap. [[Hippolytus of Rome]], ''Refutation of all Heresies'', i. 6&lt;/ref&gt; and earthquakes occurred when "the earth is considerably altered by heating and cooling".&lt;ref&gt;[[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], ap. Hippolytus, ''Refutation of all Heresies'', i. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The early philosophers often criticized traditional religious notions. [[Xenophanes]] (6th century BCE) famously said that if cows and horses had hands, "then horses would draw the forms of gods like horses, and cows like cows".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement of Alexandria]], ''Stromata'', v. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Another philosopher, [[Anaxagoras]] (5th century BCE), claimed that the [[Sun]] was "a fiery mass, larger than the [[Peloponnese]]"; a charge of impiety was brought against him, and he was forced to flee [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], ii. 6–14&lt;/ref&gt;

The first fully materialistic philosophy was produced by the [[Atomism|atomists]] [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]] (5th century BCE), who attempted to explain the formation and development of the world in terms of the chance movements of [[atom]]s moving in infinite space.

[[Euripides]] (480–406 BCE), in his play [[Bellerophon (play)|''Bellerophon'']], had the eponymous main character say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Doth some one say that there be gods above?&lt;br&gt;
There are not; no, there are not. Let no fool,&lt;br&gt;
Led by the old false fable, thus deceive you.”&lt;ref&gt;

===The Sophists===
In the fifth century BCE the [[Sophists]] began to question many of the traditional assumptions of Greek culture. [[Prodicus of Ceos]] was said to have believed that "it was the things which were serviceable to human life that had been regarded as gods",&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''De Natura Deorum'', i. 42&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Protagoras]] stated at the beginning of a book that "With regard to the gods I am unable to say either that they exist or do not exist".&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', i. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late fifth century BCE, the Greek [[lyric poetry|lyric poet]] [[Diagoras of Melos]] was sentenced to death in [[Athens]] under the charge of being a "godless person" (ἄθεος) after he made fun of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]],&lt;ref name="Garland2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garland|first1=Robert|title=Ancient Greece: Everyday Life in the Birthplace of Western Civilization|date=2008|publisher=Sterling|location=New York City, New York|isbn=978-1-4549-0908-8|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Winiarczyk"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winiarczyk|first1=Marek|title=Diagoras of Melos: A Contribution to the History of Ancient Atheism|date=2016|translator-last=Zbirohowski-Kościa|translator-first=Witold|publisher=Walther de Gruyter|location=Berlin, Germany|isbn=978-3-11-044765-1|pages=61–68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NryvDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Diagoras+of+Melos&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwianNXO5c7YAhVM4oMKHfPAA2IQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Diagoras%20of%20Melos&amp;f=false|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Winiarczyk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burkert1985"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burkert|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter Burkert|date=1985|title=Greek Religion|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-36281-0|pages=311–317|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]], ''[[Homo necans]]'', p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; but he fled the city to escape punishment.&lt;ref name="Garland2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Winiarczyk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burkert1985"/&gt; Later writers have cited Diagoras as the "first atheist",&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Solmsen|Solmsen, Friedrich]] (1942).

Comments and English text by Richard D. McKirahan. Thomas Library, Bryn Mawr College, 1997, page 3. {{ISBN|0-929524-89-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was probably not an atheist in the modern sense of the word.&lt;ref name="Winiarczyk"/&gt; Somewhat later (c. 300 BCE), the [[Cyrenaic]] philosopher [[Theodorus the Atheist|Theodorus of Cyrene]] is supposed to have denied that gods exist and wrote a book ''On the Gods'' expounding his views.

[[Euhemerus]] (c. 330–260 BCE) published his view that the gods were only the deified rulers, conquerors, and founders of the past, and that their cults and religions were in essence the continuation of vanished kingdoms and earlier political structures.&lt;ref&gt;Fragments of Euhemerus' work in Ennius' Latin translation have been preserved in [[Church Fathers|Patristic]] writings (e.g. by [[Lactantius]] and [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]), which all rely on earlier fragments in [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] 5,41–46 &amp; 6.1. Testimonies, especially in the context of polemical criticism, are found e.g. in [[Callimachus]], ''Hymn to Zeus'' 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Euhemerus was later criticized for having "spread atheism over the whole inhabited earth by obliterating the gods",&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Moralia – Isis and Osiris'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/B.html#23 23]&lt;/ref&gt; his worldview was not atheist in a strict and theoretical sense, because he differentiated that the [[Greek primordial gods|primordial deities]] were "eternal and imperishable".&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius of Caesarea, ''[[Preparation for the Gospel]]'' [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_pe_02_book2.htm II.45–48] (chapter 2); Euhemerus also acknowledged that the sun, moon, and the other celestial bodies were deities (cf. also Alan Scott, ''Origen and the Life of the Stars'', Oxford 1991, p. 55), and he regarded elemental earthly phenomena such as the wind as divine, for they had "eternal origin and eternal continuance". Nevertheless he concluded that the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] and all next-generation deities such as the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian deities]] existed only as culturally and religiously constructed divine entities with a human past (cp. also Harry Y. Gamble, "Euhemerism and Christology in Origen: 'Contra Celsum' III 22–43", in ''Vigiliae Christianae'', Vol. 33, No. 1 (1979), pp. 12–29).&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have argued that he merely aimed at reinventing the old religions in the light of the beginning of deification of political rulers such as [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;"Euhemeros", in Konrat Ziegler &amp; Walther Sontheimer, ''Der Kleine Pauly'', Bd. 2 (1979), cols. 414–415&lt;/ref&gt; Euhemerus' work was translated into Latin by [[Ennius]], possibly to [[Mythography|mythographically]] pave the way for the planned [[Apotheosis|divinization]] of [[Scipio Africanus]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Cole, "Cicero, Ennius and the Concept of Apotheosis at Rome". In ''Arethusa'' Vol. 39 No. 3 (2006), pp. 531–548&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epicureanism===
The most important Greek thinker in the development of atheism was [[Epicurus]] ({{circa}} 300 BCE).&lt;ref name="GraftonMostSettis"/&gt; Drawing on the ideas of Democritus and the Atomists, he espoused a materialistic philosophy according to which the universe was governed by the laws of chance without the need for divine intervention (see [[scientific determinism]]).&lt;ref name="EpicStanEncycl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/ |title=Epicurus (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |work=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Epicurus still maintained that the gods existed,&lt;ref name="GraftonMostSettis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EpicStanEncycl"/&gt; he believed that they were uninterested in human affairs.&lt;ref name="EpicStanEncycl"/&gt; The aim of the Epicureans was to attain ''[[ataraxia]]'' ("peace of mind") and one important way of doing this was by exposing fear of divine wrath as irrational. The Epicureans also denied the existence of an afterlife and the need to fear divine punishment after death.&lt;ref name="EpicStanEncycl"/&gt;

One of the most eloquent expressions of Epicurean thought is [[Lucretius]]' ''[[On the Nature of Things]]'' (1st century BCE) in which he held that gods exist but argued that religious fear was one the chief cause of human unhappiness and that the gods did not involve themselves in the world.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC: Ancient atheists|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/atheism/history/ancient.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Long and Sedley|first=A.A. and D.N.|title=The Hellenistic Philosophers, vol.1|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521275563|pages=144–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Epicureans also denied the existence of an afterlife and hence dismissed the fear of death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Caesar]] (100–44 BCE), who leaned considerably toward Epicureanism, also rejected the idea of an afterlife, which e.g. lead to his plea against the death sentence during the trial against [[Catiline]], where he spoke out against the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[Cato the Younger|Cato]] (cf. [[Sallust]], ''The War With Catiline'', Caesar's speech: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html#51.20 51.29] &amp; Cato's reply: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html#52.13 52.13]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Epicureans were not persecuted, but their teachings were controversial and were harshly attacked by the mainstream schools of [[Stoicism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]. The movement remained marginal, and gradually died out by the end of the [[Roman Empire]].

==The Middle Ages==
===Islamic world===
In medieval [[Islam]], Muslim scholars recognized the idea of atheism and frequently attacked [[kafir|unbelievers]], although they were unable to name any atheists.&lt;ref&gt;"Various Muslim theologians in the early Abbasid periods wrote treatises 'Against the Unbelievers,' ... the earliest extant work bearing this title is probably the ''Radd ala al-mulhid'' of the ninth-century [[Zaidiyyah|Zaydi]] theologian al-Qasim b. Ibrahim. ... Nevertheless, in the discussions of God's existence the actual opponents are not identified as individuals. As a group they are sometimes referred to as heretics, unbelievers, materialists, or skeptics. These designations often appear together, and they do not always seem to be clearly distinguished in the authors' mind." Sarah Stroumsa, (1999), ''Freethinkers of medieval Islam: Ibn al-Rawandi, Abu Bakr al-Razi and their Impact on Islamic Thought'', pages 121–3. BRILL&lt;/ref&gt; When individuals were accused of atheism, they were usually viewed as heretics rather than proponents of atheism.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Stroumsa, 1999, ''Freethinkers of Medieval Islam: Ibn al-Rdwandi, Abu Bakr al-Razi, and their Impact on Islamic Thought'', page 123. BRILL.&lt;/ref&gt; However, outspoken rationalists and atheists existed, one notable figure being the ninth-century scholar [[Ibn al-Rawandi]], who criticized the notion of religious [[prophecy]], including that of [[Muhammad]], and maintained that religious dogmas were not acceptable to reason and must be rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1971, Volume 3, page 905.&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics of religion in the Islamic world include the physician and philosopher [[Abu Bakr al-Razi]] (865–925), the poet [[Al-Maʿarri]] (973–1057), and the scholar [[Abu Isa al-Warraq]] (fl. 9th century). Al-Maʿarri, for example, wrote and taught that religion itself was a "fable invented by the ancients"&lt;ref name="Nicholson318"&gt;Reynold Alleyne Nicholson, 1962, ''A Literary History of the Arabs'', page 318. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; and that humans were "of two sorts: those with brains, but no religion, and those with religion, but no brains."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdsmt.edu/student-orgs/tfs/reading/freethought/islam.html Freethought Traditions in the Islamic World] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214102422/http://www.sdsmt.edu/student-orgs/tfs/reading/freethought/islam.html |date=14 February 2012 }} by Fred Whitehead; also quoted in Cyril Glasse, (2001), ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', p. 278. Rowman Altamira.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
In the European [[Middle Ages]], no clear expression of atheism is known. The titular character of the [[Icelandic saga]] [[Hrafnkell]], written in the late thirteenth century, says, "I think it is folly to have faith in gods". After his temple to [[Freyr]] is burnt and he is enslaved, he vows never to perform another [[Blót|sacrifice]], a position described in the sagas as ''goðlauss'', "godless". [[Jacob Grimm]] in his ''[[Deutsche Mythologie|Teutonic Mythology]]'' observes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is remarkable that Old Norse legend occasionally mentions certain men who, turning away in utter disgust and doubt from the heathen faith, placed their reliance on their own strength and virtue. Thus in the [[Sôlar lioð]] 17 we read of Vêbogi and Râdey ''â sik þau trûðu,'' "in themselves they trusted",&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Grimm, 1882, ''Teutonic Mythology'' Part 1, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
citing several other examples, including two kings.

In Christian Europe, people were persecuted for heresy, especially in countries where the [[Inquisition]] was active. Prominent examples of dissent included the Cathers and the Waldensians. These sects, however antagonistic to the Church, are not examples of Atheism. While rebellions against the Church occurred, none could be considered exactly Atheist.&lt;ref&gt;John Arnold, ''Belief and Unbelief in Medieval Europe''&lt;/ref&gt;

Another phenomenon in the Middle Ages was proofs of the existence of God. Both [[Anselm of Canterbury]], and later, [[William of Ockham]] acknowledge adversaries who doubt the existence of God. [[Thomas Aquinas]]' five proofs of God's existence and Anselm's ontological argument implicitly acknowledged the validity of the question about God's existence.&lt;ref&gt;Bullivant, Stephen, and Michael Ruse. The Oxford Handbook of Atheism. Oxford University Press, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Copleston]], however, explains that Thomas laid out his proofs not to counter atheism, but to address certain early Christian writers such as [[John of Damascus]], who asserted that knowledge of God's existence was naturally innate in man, based on his natural desire for happiness.&lt;ref name="copleston337"&gt;Frederick Copleston. 1950. ''A History of Philosophy: Volume II: Medieval Philosophy: From Augustine to Duns Scotus.'' London: Burns, Oates &amp; Washbourne. pp. 336–337&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas stated that although there is desire for happiness which forms the basis for a proof of God's existence in man, further reflection is required to understand that this desire is only fulfilled in God, not for example in wealth or sensual pleasure.&lt;ref name="copleston337"/&gt;

The charge of atheism was used to attack political or religious opponents. [[Pope Boniface VIII]], because he insisted on the political supremacy of the church, was accused by his enemies after his death of holding (unlikely) positions such as "neither believing in the immortality nor incorruptibility of the soul, nor in a life to come".&lt;ref&gt;John William Draper, 1864, [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/D/draper/drap3.htm ''History of the intellectual development of Europe''], page 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Arnold's ''Belief and Unbelief in Medieval Europe'' discusses individuals who were indifferent to the Church and did not participate in faith practices. Arnold notes that while these examples could be perceived as simply people being lazy, it demonstrates that "belief was not universally fervent". Arnold enumerates examples of people not attending church, and even those who excluded the Church from their marriage. Disbelief, Arnold argues, stemmed from boredom. Arnold argues that while some blasphemy implies the existence of God, laws demonstrate that there were also cases of blasphemy that directly attacked articles of faith. Italian preachers in the fourteenth century also warned of unbelievers and people who lacked belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Arnold|title=Belief and Unbelief in Medieval Europe|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-0340807866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance and Reformation==
During the time of the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], criticism of the religious establishment became more frequent in predominantly Christian countries, but did not amount to atheism, ''per se''.

The term ''athéisme'' was coined in France in the sixteenth century. The word "atheist" appears in English books at least as early as 1566.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |contribution=English recusant literature, 1558–1640 |volume=203 |title=A Replie to Mr Calfhills Blasphemous Answer Made Against the Treatise of the Cross |page=51 |first=John |last=Martiall |authorlink=John Marshall (priest) |year=1566 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=20snAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22to%20entre#v=snippet&amp;q=atheist&amp;f=false
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of atheism re-emerged initially as a reaction to the intellectual and religious turmoil of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the Reformation, as a charge used by those who saw the denial of god and godlessness in the controversial positions being put forward by others. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the word 'atheist' was used exclusively as an insult; nobody wanted to be regarded as an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Armstrong |first=Karen | authorlink = Karen Armstrong |title=A History of God |page=288 |year=1999 |publisher=London: Vintage |isbn=0-09-927367-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although one overtly atheistic compendium known as the ''[[Theophrastus redivivus]]'' was published by an anonymous author in the seventeenth century, atheism was an epithet implying a [[Libertine|lack of moral restraint]].&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, Jennifer Michael (2004). ''Doubt: A History''. HarperOne. pp. 325, {{ISBN|0-06-009795-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|upright|The Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] contended in the 17th century that God did not interfere in the running of the world, but rather that natural laws explained the workings of the universe.]]

According to [[Geoffrey Blainey]], the Reformation in Europe had paved the way for atheists by attacking the authority of the Catholic Church, which in turn "quietly inspired other thinkers to attack the authority of the new Protestant churches". [[Deism]] gained influence in France, Prussia and England, and proffered belief in a noninterventionist deity, but "while some deists were atheists in disguise, most were religious, and by today's standards would be called true believers". The scientific and mathematical discoveries of such as Copernicus, Newton and Descartes sketched a pattern of natural laws that lent weight to this new outlook&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.388&lt;/ref&gt; Blainey wrote that the Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] was "probably the first well known 'semi-atheist' to announce himself in a Christian land in the modern era". Spinoza had been expelled from his synagogue for his protests against the teachings of its rabbis and for failing to attend Saturday services. He believed that God did not interfere in the running of the world, but rather that natural laws explained the workings of the universe. In 1661 he published his ''[[Short Treatise on God]]'', but he was not a popular figure for the first century following his death: "An unbeliever was expected to be a rebel in almost everything and wicked in all his ways", wrote Blainey, "but here was a virtuous one. He lived the good life and made his living in a useful way. . . . It took courage to be a Spinoza or even one of his supporters. If a handful of scholars agreed with his writings, they did not so say in public".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.343&lt;/ref&gt;

How dangerous it was to be accused of being an atheist at this time is illustrated by the examples of [[Étienne Dolet]], who was [[Strangling|strangled]] and burned in 1546, and [[Giulio Cesare Vanini]], who received a similar fate in 1619. In 1689 the Polish nobleman [[Kazimierz Łyszczyński]], who had denied the existence of God in his philosophical treatise ''De non-existentia Dei'', was imprisoned unlawfully; despite [[Warsaw Confederation]] tradition and king Sobieski's intercession, Łyszczyński was condemned to death for atheism and beheaded in [[Warsaw]] after his tongue was pulled out with a burning iron and his hands slowly burned. Similarly in 1766, the French nobleman [[François-Jean de la Barre]], was [[torture]]d, beheaded, and his body burned for alleged [[vandalism]] of a [[crucifix]], a case that became a [[cause célèbre]] because [[Voltaire]] tried unsuccessfully to have the judgment reversed.

The English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679) was also accused of atheism, but he denied it. His theism was unusual, in that he held god to be material. Even earlier, the British playwright and poet [[Christopher Marlowe]] (1563–1593) was accused of atheism when a tract denying the divinity of Christ was found in his home. Before he could finish defending himself against the charge, Marlowe was murdered.

In early modern times, the first explicit atheist known by name was the German-languaged Danish critic of religion [[Matthias Knutzen]] (1646–after 1674), who published three atheist writings in 1674.&lt;ref&gt;Winfried Schröder, in: Matthias Knutzen: Schriften und Materialien (2010), p. 8. See also Rececca Moore, ''The Heritage of Western Humanism, Scepticism and Freethought'' (2011), calling Knutzen "the first open advocate of a modern atheist perspective" [http://reason.sdsu.edu/germany.html online here]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kazimierz Łyszczyński]], a Polish philosopher (executed in 1689, following a hasty and controversial trial) demonstrated strong atheism in his work ''De non-existentia Dei'':

While not gaining converts from large portions of the population, versions of deism became influential in certain intellectual circles. [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] challenged the Christian notion that human beings had been tainted by sin since the Garden of Eden, and instead proposed that humans were originally good, only later to be corrupted by civilization. The influential figure of [[Voltaire]], spread deistic notions of to a wide audience. "After the French Revolution and its outbursts of atheism, Voltaire was widely condemned as one of the causes", wrote Blainey, "Nonetheless, his writings did concede that fear of God was an essential policeman in a disorderly world: 'If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him', wrote Voltaire".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; pp.390–391&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably the first book in modern times solely dedicated to promoting atheism was written by French Catholic priest [[Jean Meslier]] (1664–1729), whose posthumously published lengthy philosophical essay (part of the original title: ''Thoughts and Feelings of Jean Meslier ... Clear and Evident Demonstrations of the Vanity and Falsity of All the Religions of the World''&lt;ref&gt;Full title: ''Mémoire des pensées et sentiments de Jean Meslier, prêtre-curé d'Etrépigny et de Balaives, sur une partie des erreurs et des abus de la conduite et du gouvernement des hommes, où l'on voit des démonstrations claires et évidentes de la vanité et de la fausseté de toutes les religions du monde, pour être adressé à ses paroissiens après sa mort et pour leur servir de témoignage de vérité à eux et à tous leurs semblables''&lt;/ref&gt;)  rejects the concept of god (both in the Christian and also in the Deistic sense), the soul, miracles and the discipline of theology.&lt;ref name="onfray"&gt;Michel Onfray (2007). ''Atheist Manifesto: The Case Against Christianity, Judaism, and Islam''. Arcade Publishing. {{ISBN|1559708204}}. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] states that Meslier's work marks the beginning of "the history of true atheism".&lt;ref name="onfray"/&gt;

By the 1770s, atheism in some predominantly Christian countries was ceasing to be a dangerous accusation that required denial, and was evolving into a position openly avowed by some. The first open denial of the existence of God and avowal of atheism since classical times may be that of [[Baron d'Holbach]] (1723–1789) in his 1770 work, ''[[The System of Nature]]''. D'Holbach was a Parisian social figure who conducted a famous salon widely attended by many intellectual notables of the day, including [[Denis Diderot]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Nevertheless, his book was published under a pseudonym, and was banned and publicly burned by the [[Executioner]].&lt;!-- Who was the "Executioner"? --&gt; {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Diderot, one of the Enlightenment's most prominent ''philosophes'' and editor-in-chief of the [[Encyclopédie]], which sought to challenge religious, particularly [[Catholicism|Catholic]], dogma said, "Reason is to the estimation of the ''philosophe'' what grace is to the Christian", he wrote. "Grace determines the Christian's action; reason the ''philosophe''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinzler.com/ushistory/diderotsupp.html |title=The Philosophe |publisher=Pinzler.com |accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot was briefly imprisoned for his writing, some of which was banned and burned.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In Scotland, [[David Hume]] produced a six volume history of England in 1754, which gave little attention to God. He implied that if God existed he was impotent in the face of European upheaval. Hume ridiculed miracles, but walked a careful line so as to avoid being too dismissive of Christianity. With Hume's presence, Edinburgh gained a reputation as a "haven of atheism", alarming many ordinary Britons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey]]; ''[[A Short History of Christianity]]''; Viking; 2011; p.392&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fête de la Raison 1793.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Fête de la Raison'' ("Festival of Reason"), Notre Dame, 20 [[Brumaire]] (1793)]]
The ''culte de la Raison'' developed during the uncertain period 1792–94 (Years I and III of the Revolution), following the [[September massacres]], when Revolutionary France was rife with fears of internal and foreign enemies. Several Parisian churches were transformed into Temples of Reason, notably the Church of Saint-Paul Saint-Louis in [[Le Marais|the Marais]]. The churches were closed in May 1793 and more securely 24 November 1793, when the [[Catholic Mass]] was forbidden.

Blainey wrote that "atheism seized the pedestal in revolutionary France in the 1790s. The secular symbols replaced the cross. In the cathedral of Notre Dame the altar, the holy place, was converted into a monument to Reason..." During the [[Reign of Terror|Terror of 1792–93]], France's Christian calendar was abolished, monasteries, convents and church properties were seized and monks and nuns expelled. Historic churches were dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; pp.397–8&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cult of Reason]] was a creed based on atheism devised during the [[French Revolution]] by [[Jacques Hébert]], [[Pierre Gaspard Chaumette]], and their supporters. It was stopped by [[Maximilien Robespierre]], a [[Deist]], who instituted the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=War, Terror, and Resistance | url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap7c.html | accessdate=31 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both cults were the outcome of the [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|"de-Christianization" of French society]] during the Revolution and part of the [[Reign of Terror]].

The Cult of Reason was celebrated in a [[carnival]] atmosphere of parades, ransacking of churches, ceremonious [[iconoclasm]], in which religious and royal images were defaced, and ceremonies which substituted the "martyrs of the Revolution" for Christian martyrs. The earliest public demonstrations took place ''en province'', outside Paris, notably by [[Hébertists]] in [[Lyon]], but took a further radical turn with the ''Fête de la Liberté'' ("Festival of Liberty") at [[Notre Dame de Paris]], 10 November (20 Brumaire) 1793, in ceremonies devised and organised by [[Pierre-Gaspard Chaumette]].

The pamphlet ''Answer to [[Joseph Priestley|Dr. Priestley's]] Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever'' (1782) is considered to be the first published declaration of atheism in Britain—plausibly the first in English (as distinct from covert or cryptically atheist works). The otherwise unknown William Hammon (possibly a pseudonym) signed the preface and postscript as editor of the work, and the anonymous main text is attributed to [[Matthew Turner (physician)|Matthew Turner]] (d. 1788?), a Liverpool physician who may have known Priestley. Historian of atheism David Berman has argued strongly for Turner's authorship, but also suggested that there may have been two authors.&lt;ref&gt;see Berman 1988, Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern history==
===Nineteenth century===
The [[French Revolution]] of 1789 catapulted atheistic thought into political notability in some Western countries, and opened the way for the nineteenth century movements of [[Rationalism]], [[Freethought]], and Liberalism. Born in 1792, [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poet]] [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], a child of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], was expelled from England's Oxford University in 1811 for submitting to the Dean an anonymous pamphlet that he wrote entitled, ''[[The Necessity of Atheism]].'' This pamphlet is considered by scholars as the first atheistic tract published in the English language. An early atheistic influence in Germany was ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' by [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] (1804–1872). He influenced other German nineteenth century atheistic thinkers like [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Stirner]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788–1860), and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900).

The freethinker [[Charles Bradlaugh]] (1833–1891) was repeatedly elected to the [[British Parliament]], but was not allowed to take his seat after his request to affirm rather than take the religious oath was turned down (he then offered to take the oath, but this too was denied him). After Bradlaugh was re-elected for the fourth time, a new Speaker allowed Bradlaugh to take the oath and permitted no objections.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Humanist Association]], [http://www.humanism.org.uk/humanism/humanist-tradition/freethinkers/charles-bradlaugh ''Charles Bradlaugh (1833–91)'']&lt;/ref&gt; He became the first outspoken atheist to sit in Parliament, where he participated in amending the [[Oaths Act 1888|Oaths Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hansard]], ''Oaths Bill 1888'', [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1888/mar/14/second-reading ''Second Reading, 14 March 1888'']; [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1888/aug/09/third-reading ''Third Reading, 9 August 1888'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Karl Marx]]
In 1844, Karl Marx (1818–1883), an atheistic political economist, wrote in his ''Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right'': "Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]]." Marx believed that people turn to religion in order to dull the pain caused by the reality of social situations; that is, Marx suggests religion is an attempt at transcending the material state of affairs in a society—the pain of class oppression—by effectively creating a dream world, rendering the religious believer amenable to [[social control]] and exploitation in this world while they hope for relief and justice in [[life after death]]. In the same essay, Marx states, "[m]an creates religion, religion does not create man".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karl|first=Marx|authorlink=Karl Marx|date=February 1844|title=A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right|journal=Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nietzsche1882.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Friedrich Nietzsche]]
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], a prominent nineteenth century philosopher, is well known for coining the aphorism ''"[[God is dead]]" ''(German: "''Gott ist tot''"); incidentally the phrase was not spoken by Nietzsche directly, but was used as a dialogue for the characters in his works. Nietzsche argued that Christian theism as a belief system had been a moral foundation of the Western world, and that the rejection and collapse of this foundation as a result of modern thinking (the ''death of God'') would naturally cause a rise in [[nihilism]] or the lack of values. While Nietzsche was staunchly atheistic, he was also concerned about the negative effects of nihilism on humanity. As such, he called for a re-evaluation of old values and a creation of new ones, hoping that in doing so humans would achieve a higher state he labeled the [[Übermensch|Overman]] (''Übermensch'').

[[Atheist feminism]] also began in the nineteenth century. Atheist feminists oppose religion as a main source of female [[oppression]] and [[gender inequality]], believing that the majority of religions are [[Sexism|sexist]] and oppressive to women.&lt;ref name="newstatesman1"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2009/07/women-god-stangroom-benson |title=Does God Hate Women? |journal=New Statesman |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century===
Atheism in the twentieth century found recognition in a wide variety of other, broader philosophies in the Western tradition, such as [[existentialism]], [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonard Peikoff]], "The Philosophy of Objectivism" lecture series (1976), [http://www.aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/atheism.html Lecture 2].&lt;/ref&gt; [[secular humanism]], [[nihilism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Marxism]], [[anarchism]], [[feminism]],&lt;ref&gt;Overall, Christine. "Feminism and Atheism", in Martin, Michael, ed. (2007), The Cambridge Companion to Atheism, pp. 233–246. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and the general scientific and [[rationalist movement]]. [[Neopositivism]] and [[analytical philosophy]] discarded classical rationalism and metaphysics in favor of strict empiricism and epistemological [[nominalism]]. Proponents such as [[Bertrand Russell]] emphatically rejected belief in God. In his early work, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] attempted to separate metaphysical and supernatural language from rational discourse. [[H. L. Mencken]] sought to debunk both the idea that science and religion are compatible, and the idea that science is a dogmatic belief system just like any religion.&lt;ref&gt;Mencken, H. L. "Treatise on the Gods," 2nd ed., The Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. J. Ayer]] asserted the unverifiability and meaninglessness of religious statements, citing his adherence to the empirical sciences. The [[structuralism]] of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]] sourced religious language to the human subconscious, denying its transcendental meaning. [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J. N. Findlay]] and [[J. J. C. Smart]] argued that the existence of God is not logically necessary. [[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalists]] and [[Materialism|materialists]] such as [[John Dewey]] considered the natural world to be the basis of everything, denying the existence of God or immortality.&lt;ref&gt;Zdybicka, Zofia J. (2005), "Atheism", p. 16 in Maryniarczyk, Andrzej, Universal Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 1, Polish Thomas Aquinas Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smart, J.C.C. (9 March 2004). "Atheism and Agnosticism". Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Retrieved 2007-04-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]] wrote that during the twentieth century, atheists in Western societies became more active and even militant, though they often "relied essentially on arguments used by numerous radical Christians since at least the eighteenth century". They rejected the idea of an interventionist God, and said that Christianity promoted war and violence, though "the most ruthless leaders in the Second World War were atheists and secularists who were intensely hostile to both Judaism and Christianity" and "Later massive atrocities were committed in the East by those ardent atheists, [[Pol Pot]] and [[Mao Zedong]]". Some scientists were meanwhile articulating a view that as the world becomes more educated, religion will be superseded.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey]]; ''[[A Short History of Christianity]]''; Viking; 2011; p.543&lt;/ref&gt;

===State atheism===
[[File:Mao, Bulganin, Stalin, Ulbricht Tsedenbal.jpeg|thumb|[[Mao Zedong]] with [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1949. Both leaders repressed religion and established [[state atheism]] throughout their respective Communist spheres.]]
Often, the state's opposition to religion took more violent forms. [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] documents widespread persecution, imprisonments and torture of believers in his seminal work ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]''. Consequently, religious organizations, such as the Catholic Church, were among the most stringent opponents of communist regimes. In some cases, the initial strict measures of control and opposition to religious activity were gradually relaxed in communist states. Pope [[Pius XI]] followed his encyclicals challenging the new right-wing creeds of [[Italian Fascism]] (''[[Non abbiamo bisogno]]'', 1931) and [[Nazism]] (''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'', 1937) with a denunciation of atheistic Communism in ''[[Divini redemptoris]]'' (1937).&lt;ref name="EBOPiusXI"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Online: ''Pius XI''; web Apr. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russian Orthodox Church]], for centuries the strongest of all Orthodox Churches, was suppressed by the Soviet government.&lt;ref name="Viking p.494"&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey]]; ''[[A Short History of Christianity]]''; Viking; 2011; p.494&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, the Soviet regime arrested the [[Patriarch Tikhon|Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name="Blainey"&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey]]; ''A Short History of Christianity''; Viking; 2011; p.493&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of [[Vladimir Lenin]], with his rejection of religious authority as a tool of oppression and his strategy of "patently explain," Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] energetically pursued the persecution of the Church through the 1920s and 1930s. Lenin wrote that every religious idea and every idea of God "is unutterable vileness... of the most dangerous kind, 'contagion of the most abominable kind".&lt;ref name="MartinAmis"&gt;Martin Amis; Koba the Dread; Vintage Books; London; 2003; {{ISBN|1400032202}}; p.30-31&lt;/ref&gt; Many priests were killed and imprisoned. Thousands of churches were closed, some turned into hospitals. In 1925 the government founded the [[League of Militant Atheists]] to intensify the persecution. The regime only relented in its persecution following the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941.&lt;ref name="Viking p.494"/&gt; Bullock wrote that "A Marxist regime was 'godless' by definition, and Stalin had mocked religious belief since his days in the Tiflis seminary". His assault on the Russian peasantry, wrote Bullock, "had been as much an attack on their traditional religion as on their individual holdings, and the defense of it had played a major part in arousing peasant resistance . . . ".&lt;ref name="Stalin pp.412"&gt;[[Alan Bullock]]; ''[[Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives]]''; Fontana Press; 1993; pp.412&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Divini Redemptoris'', Pius XI said that atheistic Communism being led by Moscow was aimed at "upsetting the social order and at undermining the very foundations of Christian civilization":&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19031937_divini-redemptoris_en.html Divini Redemptoris – Encyclical of Pope Pius XI on Atheistic Communism]; by Pope Pius XI; 19 March 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

The central figure in Italian Fascism was the atheist [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref name="Christianity pp.495-6"&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey]]; ''[[A Short History of Christianity]]''; Viking; 2011; pp.495–6&lt;/ref&gt; In his early career, Mussolini was a strident opponent of the Church, and the first [[Fascist manifesto|Fascist program]], written in 1919, had called for the secularization of Church property in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;F. L. Carsten; ''The Rise of Fascism''; Methuen &amp; Co Ltd; London; 1976; p.77&lt;/ref&gt; More pragmatic than his German ally Adolf Hitler, Mussolini later moderated his stance, and in office, permitted the teaching of religion in schools and came to terms with the Papacy in the [[Lateran Treaty]].&lt;ref name="Christianity pp.495-6"/&gt; Nevertheless, ''Non abbiamo bisogno'' condemned his Fascist movement's "pagan worship of the State" and "revolution which snatches the young from the Church and from Jesus Christ, and which inculcates in its own young people hatred, violence and irreverence."&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Online: ''Fascism – identification with Christianity''; web Apr. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Party membership was required for civil service jobs. The majority of Nazi Party members did not leave their churches. Evans wrote that, by 1939, 95 percent of Germans still called themselves Protestant or Catholic, while 3.5 percent were ''[[gottgläubig]]'' (lit. "believing in god") and 1.5 percent atheist. Most in these latter categories were "convinced Nazis who had left their Church at the behest of the Party, which had been trying since the mid 1930s to reduce the influence of Christianity in society".&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J.

Across Eastern Europe following World War II, the parts of the [[Nazi Empire]] conquered by the Soviet [[Red Army]], and Yugoslavia became one party Communist states, which, like the Soviet Union, were antipathetic to religion. Persecutions of religious leaders followed.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hebblethwaite; Paul VI, the First Modern Pope; Harper Collins Religious; 1993; p.211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Vikiing; 2003; p.566 &amp; 568&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union ended its truce against the Russian Orthodox Church, and extended its persecutions to the newly Communist Eastern bloc: "In [[Polish anti-religious campaign|Poland]], Hungary, Lithuania and other Eastern European countries, Catholic leaders who were unwilling to be silent were denounced, publicly humiliated or imprisoned by the Communists.

The 1976 Constitution of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania, for instance, was firmly based on a Marxist dismissal of religion as the opiate of the masses. It provided: "The state recognizes no religion of any kind and supports and develops the atheist view so as to ingrain in to the people the scientific and materialistic world-view."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right to religious practice was restored with the fall of communism in 1991.

Further post-war communist victories in the East saw religion purged by atheist regimes across China, North Korea and much of Indo-China.&lt;ref name="Viking p.508"/&gt; In 1949, China became a Communist state under the leadership of [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[Communist Party of China]]. China itself had been a cradle of religious thought since ancient times, being the birthplace of [[Confucianism]] and [[Daoism]], and Buddhists having arrived in the first century AD. Under Mao, China became officially atheist, and though some religious practices were permitted to continue under State supervision, religious groups deemed a threat to order have been suppressed—as with Tibetan Buddhism from 1959 and [[Falun Gong]] in recent years.

In India, [[E. V.

[[Atheist feminism]] has also become more prominent in the 2010s. In 2012 the first "Women in Secularism" conference was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womeninsecularism.org/2012/|title=Women in Secularism: 2012 conference in Washington, DC|work=Women in Secularism|accessdate=27 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730235818/http://www.womeninsecularism.org/2012/|archive-date=30 July 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Secular Woman was founded on 28 June 2012 as the first national American organization focused on non-religious women. The mission of Secular Woman is to amplify the voice, presence, and influence of non-religious women. The [[Atheist feminism|atheist feminist movement]] has also become increasingly focused on fighting [[misogyny]], [[sexism]] and [[sexual harassment]] within the atheist movement itself, especially since the upheaval following [[Michael Shermer]]'s allegations of [[sexual assault]] and coverage of his violent behavior applied by [[James Randi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/markoppenheimer/will-misogyny-bring-down-the-atheist-movement|title=Will Misogyny Bring Down The Atheist Movement?|publisher=[[BuzzFeed]]|first=Mark|last=Oppenheimer|date=12 September 2014|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Madison, Wisconsin's common council amended their city's equal opportunity ordinance, adding atheism as a protected class in the areas of employment, housing, and public accommodations.&lt;ref name="channel1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Time for Kids |url=http://www.channel3000.com/news/madison-first-in-nation-to-pass-ordinance-protecting-atheists/32125682 |title=Madison first in nation to pass ordinance protecting atheists &amp;#124; News |publisher=Channel3000.com |date=1 April 2015 |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes Madison the first city in America to pass an ordinance protecting atheists.&lt;ref name="channel1"/&gt;

On 16 December 2016, [[Barack Obama]] signed into law the [[Frank R.

{{Information science}}
'''Information management''' ('''IM''') concerns a cycle of organizational activity: the acquisition of [[information]] from one or more sources, the custodianship and the distribution of that information to those who need it, and its ultimate [[disposition]] through [[archiving]] or deletion.

This cycle of organisational involvement with information involves a variety of [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s, including those who are responsible for assuring the [[quality (business)|quality]], [[accessibility]] and [[utility]] of acquired information; those who are responsible for its safe [[Data storage device|storage]] and [[:wikt:disposal|disposal]]; and those who need it for [[decision making]]. Stakeholders might have rights to originate, change, distribute or delete information according to organisational information management [[policies]].

Information management embraces all the generic concepts of management, including the [[planning]], [[organizing (management)|organizing]], structuring, [[Business process|process]]ing, [[Internal control|control]]ling, [[evaluation]] and [[Data reporting|reporting]] of information activities, all of which is needed in order to meet the needs of those with organisational roles or functions that depend on information. These generic concepts allow the information to be presented to the audience or the correct group of people. After individuals are able to put that information to use, it then gains more value.

Information management is closely related to, and overlaps with, the management of ''[[data]]'', ''[[system]]s'', ''[[technology]]'', ''[[Business process|process]]es'' and – where the availability of information is critical to organisational success – ''[[strategy]]''. This broad view of the realm of information management contrasts with the earlier, more traditional view, that the [[Project life cycle|life cycle]] of managing information is an operational matter that requires specific procedures, organisational capabilities and standards that deal with information as a [[product (business)|product]] or a service.

==History==

===Emergent ideas out of data management===
In the 1970s, the management of information largely concerned matters closer to what would now be called [[data management]]: [[punched cards]], [[magnetic tape]]s and other record-keeping [[Digital media|media]], involving a life cycle of such formats requiring origination, distribution, backup, maintenance and disposal. At this time the huge potential of [[information technology]] began to be recognised: for example a single [[Integrated circuit|chip]] storing a whole [[book]], or [[electronic mail]] moving messages instantly around the world, remarkable ideas at the time.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, C., 1979. ''The Mighty Micro'', London: Victor Gollancz.&lt;/ref&gt; With the proliferation of information technology and the extending reach of information systems in the 1980s and 1990s,&lt;ref name="Venkat0"&gt;Venkatraman, N., 1994. IT-enabled business transformation: from automation to business scope redefinition. ''Sloan Management Review'', 35(2), pp.73–87&lt;/ref&gt; information management took on a new form. Progressive businesses such as [[British Petroleum]] transformed the vocabulary of what was then "[[IT management]]", so that “[[systems analyst]]s” became “[[business analyst]]s”, “monopoly supply” became a mixture of “[[insourcing]]” and “[[outsourcing]]”, and the large IT function was transformed into “lean teams” that began to allow some agility in the processes that harness information for [[business benefit]].&lt;ref name="Cross and Earl"&gt;Cross, J. &amp; Earl, M., 1997. Transformation of the IT function at British Petroleum. ''MIS Quarterly'', 21(4), page 403&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of [[senior management]] interest in information at British Petroleum extended from the creation of value through improved [[business process]]es, based upon the effective management of information, permitting the implementation of appropriate information systems (or “[[application software|applications]]”) that were operated on [[IT infrastructure]] that was [[outsource]]d.&lt;ref name="Cross and Earl" /&gt; In this way, information management was no longer a simple job that could be performed by anyone who had nothing else to do, it became highly strategic and a matter for [[senior management]] attention. An understanding of the technologies involved, an ability to manage information systems [[project]]s and [[business change]] well, and a willingness to align technology and business strategies all became necessary.&lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"&gt;Ward, J. &amp; Peppard, J., 2002. ''Strategic Planning for Information Systems'' (3rd Edition), Chichester: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positioning information management in the bigger picture===
In the transitional period leading up to the strategic view of information management, Venkatraman (a strong advocate of this transition and transformation,&lt;ref name="Venkat2"&gt;Venkatraman, N., 1994. IT-enabled business transformation: from automation to business scope redefinition. ''Sloan Management Review'', 35(2), pp.73–87.&lt;/ref&gt; proffered a simple arrangement of ideas that succinctly brought together the  managements [[Data management|of data]], information, and [[knowledge management|knowledge]] (see the figure)) argued that:

* Data that is maintained in IT infrastructure has to be ''interpreted'' in order to render information.
* The information in our information systems has to be ''understood'' in order to emerge as knowledge.
* Knowledge allows managers to ''take effective decisions''.
* Effective decisions have to lead to ''appropriate actions''. 
* Appropriate actions are expected to deliver ''meaningful results''.

[[File:DIKAR model.jpg|thumb|This simple model summarises a presentation by Venkatraman in 1996, as reported by Ward and Peppard (2002, page 207).&lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"/&gt;]]
This is often referred to as the [[DIKAR]] model: Data, Information, Knowledge, Action and Result,&lt;ref name="Venkat1"&gt;Venkatraman, N., 1996. Managing IT resources as a value center, ''IS Executive Seminar Series, Cranfield School of Management''&lt;/ref&gt; it gives a strong clue as to the layers involved in aligning technology and organisational strategies, and it can be seen as a pivotal moment in changing attitudes to information management.  The recognition that information management is an investment that must deliver meaningful results is important to all modern organisations that depend on information and good decision-making for their success.&lt;ref name="Bytheway"&gt;Bytheway, A., 2015. [https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319119083 Investing in Information: the Information Management Body of Knowledge], Geneva: Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical background==

===Behavioural and organisational theories===
It is commonly believed that good information management is crucial to the smooth working of organisations, and although there is no commonly accepted [[theory]] of information management ''per se'', behavioural and organisational theories help. Following the [[behavioural science]] theory of management, mainly developed at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and prominently supported by March and Simon,&lt;ref name="March and Simon" /&gt; most of what goes on in modern organizations is actually information handling and decision making. One crucial factor in information handling and decision making is an individual's ability to process information and to make decisions under limitations that might derive from the context: a person's age, the situational complexity, or a lack of requisite quality in the information that is at hand – all of which is exacerbated by the rapid advance of technology and the new kinds of [[system]] that it enables, especially as the [[social web]] emerges as a phenomenon that business cannot ignore. And yet, well before there was any general recognition of the importance of information management in organisations, March and Simon &lt;ref name="March and Simon"&gt;March, J.G. &amp; Simon, H.A., 1958. ''Organizations'', Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; argued that organizations have to be considered as [[cooperative systems]], with a high level of information processing and a vast need for decision making at various levels. Instead of using the model of the "[[economic man]]", as advocated in classical theory &lt;ref name="Opp"&gt;see Opp, K.-D., 1985. Sociology and economic man. ''Zeitschrift für die gesamte Staatswissenschaft/Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics'', pp.213–243&lt;/ref&gt; they proposed "[[administrative man]]" as an alternative, based on their argumentation about the cognitive limits of rationality. Additionally they proposed the notion of [[satisficing]], which entails searching through the available alternatives until an acceptability threshold is met - another idea that still has currency.&lt;ref name="Winter"&gt;Winter, S.G., 2000. The satisficing principle in capability learning. ''Strategic Management Journal'', 21(10-11), pp.981–996&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic theory===
In addition to the organisational factors mentioned by March and Simon, there are other issues that stem from economic and environmental dynamics. There is the cost of collecting and evaluating the information needed to take a decision, including the time and effort required.&lt;ref name="Hedberg"&gt;Hedberg, Bo (1981), "How organizations learn and unlearn", in: Nyström, P.C. &amp; Starbuck, W.H., ''Handbook of Organizational Design'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The [[transaction cost]] associated with information processes can be high. In particular, established organizational rules and procedures can prevent the taking of the most appropriate decision, leading to sub-optimum outcomes 
.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"&gt;Mackenzie K.D. (1978), ''Organizational Structures'', AHM Publishing Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullins"&gt;Mullins, L.J (1993), ''Management and Organizational Behaviours'', 3rd ed., Pitman Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; This is an issue that has been presented as a major problem with bureaucratic organizations that lose the economies of strategic change because of entrenched attitudes.&lt;ref name="Wigand"&gt;Wigand, Rolf T., Picot, Arnold and Reichwald, Ralf (1997), ''Information, Organization and Management: Expanding Markets and Corporate Boundaries'', Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic information management==

===Background===
According to the Carnegie Mellon School an organization's ability to process information is at the core of organizational and managerial [[competence (human resources)|competency]], and an organization's strategies must be designed to improve information processing capability &lt;ref name="Cyert"&gt;Cyert, R.M. &amp; March, J.G., 1959. A behavioural theory of organizational objectives. ''Modern Organization Theory'', Wiley, New York, pp.76–90&lt;/ref&gt; and as information systems that provide that capability became formalised and automated, competencies were severely tested at many levels.&lt;ref name="Morton"&gt;Morton, M.S.S., 1991. ''The corporation of the 1990s: Information technology and organizational transformation'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; It was recognised that organisations needed to be able to learn and adapt in ways that were never so evident before &lt;ref name="Senge"&gt;Senge, P.M., 1990. ''The fifth discipline'', Doubleday&lt;/ref&gt; and academics began to organise and publish definitive works concerning the strategic management of information, and information systems.&lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"&gt;Ward, J. &amp; Peppard, J., 2002. ''Strategic Planning for Information Systems'' (3rd Edition), Chichester: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Earl"&gt;Earl, M.J., 1989. ''Management Strategies for Information Technology'', Upper Saddle River, NJ, USA: Prentice-Hall, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, the ideas of [[business process]] management &lt;ref name="Hammer and Champy"&gt;Hammer, M. &amp; Champy, J., 2009. ''Reengineering the Corporation: Manifesto for Business Revolution'', A, Zondervan&lt;/ref&gt; and [[knowledge management]] &lt;ref name="Nonaka and Takeuchi"&gt;Nonaka, I. &amp; Takeuchi, H., 1995. ''The knowledge creating company: how Japanese companies create the dynamics of innovation'', New York, NY, USA: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; although much of the optimistic early thinking about [[business process redesign]] has since been discredited in the information management literature.&lt;ref name="Belmiro"&gt;Belmiro, T., Gardiner, P. &amp; Simmons, J., 1997. Business process re-engineering—A discredited vocabulary? ''International Journal of Information Management'', 17(1), pp.21–33&lt;/ref&gt; In the strategic studies field, it is considered of the highest priority the understanding of the information environment, conceived as the aggregate of individuals, organizations, and systems that collect, process, disseminate, or act on information. This environment consists of three interrelated dimensions which continuously interact with individuals, organizations, and systems. These dimensions are the physical, informational, and cognitive.&lt;ref&gt;Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Army (2012). Information Operations. Joint Publication 3-13. Joint Doctrine Support Division, 116 Lake View Parkway, Suffolk, VA., p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aligning technology and business strategy with information management===

Venkatraman has provided a simple view of the requisite capabilities of an organisation that wants to manage information well – the [[DIKAR]] model (see above). He also worked with others to understand how technology and business strategies could be appropriately aligned in order to identify specific capabilities that are needed.&lt;ref name="Henderson and Venkat"&gt;Henderson, J.C. &amp; Venkatraman, N., 1993. Strategic alignment: leveraging information technology for transforming organizations. ''IBM Systems Journal'', 32(1), pp.4–16&lt;/ref&gt; This work was paralleled by other writers in the world of consulting,&lt;ref name="Zachman"&gt;Zachman, J. A. (1987). A framework for information systems architecture. ''IBM Systems Journal'', 26(3), 590–616&lt;/ref&gt; practice &lt;ref name="Cross"&gt;Cross, J., 1995. IT outsourcing : British Petroleum’s competitive approach. ''Harvard Business Review'', 73(3), p.94&lt;/ref&gt; and academia.&lt;ref name="Ward2"&gt;Ward, J. &amp; Daniel, E., 2005. ''Benefits Management: Delivering Value from IS and IT Investments'', Chichester: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

===A contemporary portfolio model for information===
Bytheway has collected and organised basic tools and techniques for information management in a single volume.&lt;ref name="Bytheway" /&gt;  At the heart of his view of information management is a portfolio model that takes account of the surging interest in external sources of information and the need to organise un-structured information external so as to make it useful (see the figure).

[[File:An Information Portfolio.jpg|thumb|This portfolio model organizes issues of internal and external sourcing and management of information, that may be either structured or unstructured.]]

Such an information portfolio as this shows how information can be gathered and usefully organised, in four stages:

'''Stage 1''': Taking advantage of [[public information]]: recognise and adopt well-structured external schemes of reference data, such as post codes, weather data, GPS positioning data and travel timetables, exemplified in the personal computing press.&lt;ref name="Ashbrook"&gt;Ashbrook, D. &amp; Starner, T., 2003. Using GPS to learn significant locations and predict movement across multiple users. ''Personal and Ubiquitous Computing'', 7(5), pp.275–286&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage 2''': Tagging the noise on the [[world wide web]]: use existing schemes such as [[post code]]s and [[GPS]] data or more typically by adding “tags”, or construct a formal [[ontology]] that provides structure. Shirky provides an overview of these two approaches.&lt;ref name="Shirky"&gt;Shirky, C., 2005. Shirky: Ontology is Overrated -- Categories, Links, and Tags. ''Clay Shirky’s Writings About the Internet''. Available at: http://shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html [Accessed May 23, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage 3''': Sifting and analysing: in the wider world the generalised ontologies that are under development extend to hundreds of entities and hundreds of relations between them and provide the means to elicit meaning from large volumes of data. Structured data in databases works best when that structure reflects a higher-level information model – an ontology, or an [[entity-relationship model]].&lt;ref name="Noy"&gt;Noy, N.F., McGuinness, D.L. &amp; others, 2001. Ontology development 101: A guide to creating your first ontology, ''Stanford knowledge systems laboratory technical report KSL-01-05 and Stanford medical informatics technical report SMI-2001-0880''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage 4''': Structuring and archiving: with the large volume of data available from sources such as the [[social web]] and from the miniature [[telemetry]] systems used in personal [[health management]], new ways to archive and then trawl data for meaningful information. [[Map-reduce]] methods, originating from [[functional programming]], are a more recent way of eliciting information from large archival [[dataset]]s that is becoming interesting to regular businesses that have very large data resources to work with, but it requires advanced multi-processor resources.&lt;ref name="Chu"&gt;Chu, C. et al., 2007. Map-reduce for machine learning on multicore. ''Advances in neural information processing systems'', 19, p.281&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competencies to manage information well===
The [[Information Management Body of Knowledge]] was made available on the world wide web in 2004 &lt;ref name="IMBOK"&gt;IMBOK, 2004. ''The Information Management Body of Knowledge''. Available at: http://www.imbok.org [Accessed May 12, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; 
and sets out to show that the required management competencies to derive real benefits from an investment in information are complex and multi-layered. The framework model that is the basis for understanding competencies comprises six “knowledge” areas and four “process” areas:

[[File:IMBOK Framework.jpg|thumb|This framework is the basis of organising the "Information Management Body of Knowledge" first made available in 2004. This version is adapted by the addition of "Business information" in 2014.]]
;The information management knowledge areas
The IMBOK is based on the argument that there are six areas of required management competency, two of which (“business process management” and “business information management”) are very closely related.&lt;ref name="Bytheway2"&gt;Bytheway, A., 2015. ''Investing in Information:  the Information Management Body of Knowledge'', Geneva: Springer,
 p29&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Information technology''': The pace of change of [[technology]] and the pressure to constantly acquire the newest technological products can undermine the stability of the [[infrastructure]] that supports systems, and thereby optimises [[business process]]es and delivers benefits. It is necessary to manage the “[[supply side]]” and recognise that technology is, increasingly, becoming a [[commodity]].&lt;ref name="Carr"&gt;Carr, N., 2003. IT doesn’t matter. In ''Wringing real value from IT''. HBR OnPoint, pp. 3–10&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Information system''': While historically information systems were developed [[in-house]], over the years it has become possible to acquire most of the software systems that an organisation needs from the [[Application software|software package]] industry. However, there is still the potential for [[competitive advantage]] from the implementation of new systems ideas that deliver to the strategic intentions of organisations.&lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"/&gt;
* '''Business processes and Business information''': [[Information system]]s are applied to [[business process]]es in order to improve them, and they bring data to the business that becomes useful as [[business information]]. [[Business process management]] is still seen as a relatively new idea because it is not universally adopted, and it has been difficult in many cases; business ''information'' management is even more of a challenge.&lt;ref name="Belmiro0"&gt;Belmiro, T.R. et al., 2000. Are BPR practitioners really addressing business processes? ''International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management'', 20(10), pp.1183–1203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davenport"&gt;Davenport, T.H. &amp; Short, J., 2003. Information technology and business process redesign. ''Operations management: critical perspectives on business and management'', 1, p.97&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Business benefit''': What are the benefits that we are seeking? It is necessary not only to be brutally honest about what ''can'' be achieved, but also to ensure the active management and assessment of benefit delivery. Since the emergence and popularisation of the [[Balanced scorecard]] &lt;ref name="Kaplan and Norton"&gt;Kaplan, R. &amp; Norton, D., 1996. ''The balanced scorecard - translating stragegy into action'', Boston MA: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; there has been huge interest in business performance management but not much serious effort has been made to relate business performance management to the benefits of information technology investments and the introduction of new [[information system]]s until the turn of the [[millennium]].&lt;ref name="Ward2" /&gt;
* '''Business strategy''': Although a long way from the workaday issues of managing information in organisations, [[strategy]] in most organisations simply has to be informed by information technology and information systems opportunities, whether to address poor performance or to improve differentiation and [[Competition (companies)|competitiveness]]. Strategic analysis tools such as the [[value chain]] and [[critical success factor]] analysis are directly dependent on proper attention to the information that is (or could be) managed &lt;ref name="Ward and Peppard"/&gt;

;The information management processes
Even with full capability and competency within the six knowledge areas, it is argued that things can still go wrong. The problem lies in the migration of ideas and information management value from one area of competency to another. Summarising what Bytheway explains in some detail (and supported by selected secondary references):&lt;ref name="Bytheway3"&gt;Bytheway, A., 2015. ''Investing in Information: the Information Management Body of Knowledge'', Geneva: Springer,
 p31&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Projects''': Information technology is without value until it is engineered into information systems that meet the needs of the business by means of good [[project management]].&lt;ref name="Schwalbe"&gt;Schwalbe, K., 2013. ''Information technology project management'', Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Business change''': The best information systems succeed in delivering benefits through the achievement of change within the business systems, but people do not appreciate change that makes new demands upon their skills in the ways that new information systems often do. Contrary to common expectations, there is some evidence that the [[public sector]] has succeeded with information technology induced [[business change]].&lt;ref name="Scholl"&gt;Scholl, H.J., 2005. E-government-induced business process change (BPC): An empirical study of current practices. ''International Journal of Electronic Government Research'' (IJEGR), 1(2), pp.27–49&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Business operations''': With new systems in place, with [[business process]]es and [[business information]] improved, and with staff finally ready and able to work with new processes, then the business can get to work, even when new systems extend far beyond the boundaries of a single business.&lt;ref name="Seed"&gt;Saeed, K.A., Malhotra, M.K. &amp; Grover, V., 2005. Examining the Impact of Interorganizational Systems on Process Efficiency and Sourcing Leverage in Buyer–Supplier Dyads. ''Decision Sciences'', 36(3), pp.365–396&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Performance management''': [[Investment]]s are no longer solely about financial results, financial success must be balanced with internal efficiency, [[customer satisfaction]], and with [[organisational learning]] and development.&lt;ref name="Kaplan and Norton" /&gt;

===Summary===
There are always many ways to see a business, and the information management viewpoint is only one way. It is important to remember that other areas of business activity will also contribute to strategy – it is not only good information management that moves a business forwards. [[Corporate governance]], [[human resource management]], [[product development]] and [[marketing]] will all have an important role to play in strategic ways, and we must not see one domain of activity alone as the sole source of strategic success. On the other hand, corporate governance, human resource management, product development and marketing are all dependent on effective information management, and so in the final analysis our competency to manage information well, on the broad basis that is offered here, can be said to be predominant.

==Operationalising information management==

===Managing requisite change===
Organizations are often confronted with many information management challenges and issues at the [[operational level]], especially when [[organisational change]] is engendered. The novelty of new [[systems architecture]]s and a lack of experience with new styles of information management requires a level of organisational [[change management]] that is notoriously difficult to deliver. As a result of a general organisational reluctance to change, to enable new forms of information management, there might be (for example): a shortfall in the requisite resources, a failure to acknowledge new classes of information and the new procedures that use them, a lack of support from senior management leading to a loss of strategic vision, and even political manoeuvring that undermines the operation of the whole organisation.&lt;ref name="Knights and Murray"&gt;Knights, D. &amp; Murray, F., 1994. ''Managers Divided'', Chichester: John Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; However, the implementation of new forms of information management should normally lead to operational benefits.

===The early work of Galbraith===
In early work, taking an information processing view of organisation design, Jay [[Galbraith]] has identified five tactical areas to increase information processing capacity and reduce the need for information processing.&lt;ref name="Galbraith"&gt;Galbraith, J.R., 1977. ''Organization design'', Addison Wesley&lt;/ref&gt;

* Developing, implementing, and monitoring all aspects of the “environment” of an organization.
* Creation of slack resources so as to decrease the load on the overall [[hierarchy]] of resources and to reduce information processing relating to overload.
* Creation of self-contained tasks with defined boundaries and that can achieve proper closure, and with all the [[resource]]s at hand required to perform the task.
* Recognition of lateral relations that cut across functional units, so as to move decision power to the [[Business process|process]] instead of fragmenting it within the [[hierarchy]].
* Investment in vertical information systems that route [[information flow]]s for a specific task (or set of tasks) in accordance to the applied [[business logic]].

===The matrix organisation===
The lateral relations concept leads to an organizational form that is different from the simple hierarchy, the “[[matrix organization]]”.  This brings together the vertical (hierarchical) view of an organisation and the horizontal (product or project) view of the work that it does visible to the outside world. The creation of a matrix organization is one management response to a persistent fluidity of external demand, avoiding multifarious and spurious responses to episodic demands that tend to be dealt with individually.

The most extreme form of such violence may be termed ''battering'', ''intimate terrorism'', ''coercive controlling violence'', or simply ''[[coercive control]]'', in which one person is violent and controlling; this is generally perpetrated by men against women, and is the most likely of the types to require medical services and the use of a [[women's shelter]].&lt;ref name="Regan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pamela Regan|title=Close Relationships|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=1136851607|year=2011|pages=456–460|accessdate=March 1, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MZCsAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT456}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emery"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert E.

The most common but less injurious form of intimate partner violence is ''situational couple violence'' (also known as ''situational violence''), which is conducted by individuals of both genders nearly equally,&lt;ref name="Emery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anglin &amp; Homeier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Howe p. 370"/&gt; and is more likely to occur among younger couples, including adolescents (see [[teen dating violence]]) and those of college age.&lt;ref name="Howe p. 370"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowen"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Erica Bowen, Kate Walker|title=The Psychology of Violence in Adolescent Romantic Relationships|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|isbn=1137321407|year=2015|pages=107–108|accessdate=March 1, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6TsTBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT107}}&lt;/ref&gt; A last form of violence, in which both partners in the relationship engage in controlling and violent behavior, is called ''mutual violent control''.

==Background==
[[File:Maltraitance fait aux femmes.jpg|thumb|Physical violence against a woman in [[Benin]].]]
Intimate partner violence occurs between two people in an intimate relationship. It may occur between heterosexual or homosexual couples and victims can be male or female. Couples may be dating, cohabiting or married and violence can occur in or outside of the home.&lt;ref name="Howe p. 370"/&gt;

Studies in the 1990s showed that both men and women could be abusers or victims of domestic violence.{{refn|Gelles 1980, 1989; McNeely and Mann 1990; Shupe, Stacey, and Hazelwood 1987; Straus 1973; Straus, Gelles, and Steinmetz 1980; Steinmetz 1977/1978.|group=nb}} Women are more likely to act violently in retaliation or self-defense and tend to engage in less severe forms of violence than men whereas men are more likely to commit long-term cycles of abuse than women. 

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) defines intimate partner violence as "any behaviour within an intimate relationship that causes physical, psychological or sexual harm to those in the relationship".&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Krug | first1 = Etienne G. | last2 = Dahlberg | first2 = Linda L. | last3 = Mercy | first3 = James A. | last4 = Zwi | first4 = Anthony B. | last5 = Lozano | first5 = Rafael | title = World report on violence and health | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | year = 2002 | url = http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/full_en.pdf | isbn = 9789240681804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO also adds controlling behaviors as a form of abuse.&lt;ref name="apps.who.int"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Understanding and addressing intimate partner violence | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | url = http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/77432/1/WHO_RHR_12.36_eng.pdf | id = WHO/RHR/12.36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Screening tools===
The [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) as of 2018 recommends screening women of reproductive age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Draft Recommendation Statement: Intimate Partner Violence, Elder Abuse, and Abuse of Vulnerable Adults: Screening  - US Preventive Services Task Force|url=https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/draft-recommendation-statement/intimate-partner-violence-and-abuse-of-elderly-and-vulnerable-adults-screening1|website=www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org|accessdate=26 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HITS is a four-item scale rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (never) to 5 (frequently). This tool was Initially developed and tested among family physicians and family practice offices, and since then has been evaluated in diverse outpatient settings. Internal reliability and concurrent validity are acceptable. Generally, sensitivity of this measure has found to be lower among men than among women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The WAST is an eight-item measure (there is a short form of the WAST that consists of the first two items only). It was originally developed for family physicians, but subsequently has been tested in the emergency department. It has been found to have good internal reliability and acceptable concurrent validity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The PVS is a three-item measure scored on a yes/no scale, with positive responses to any question denoting abuse. It was developed as a brief instrument for the emergency department.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The AAS is a five-item measure scored on a yes/no scale, with positive responses to any question denoting abuse. It was created to detect abuse perpetrated against pregnant women.

Other examples she cites are selective abortion, female genital mutilation, early, enforced marriage, honour killings, rape, trafficking, prostitution and sexual violence in war.

===Intimate terrorism===

Intimate terrorism, or coercive controlling violence (CCV), occurs when one partner in a relationship, typically a man, uses [[Abusive power and control|coercive control and power]] over the other partner,&lt;ref name="Anglin &amp; Homeier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flood 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bogat 2016"/&gt; using threats, [[intimidation]], and [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolation]]. CCV relies on severe psychological abuse for controlling purposes; when physical abuse occurs it too is severe.&lt;ref name="Bogat 2016"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bogat |first1=G.

===Violent resistance===
Violent resistance (VR), a form of [[self-defense]], is violence perpetrated by victims against their partners who have exerted intimate terrorism against them.&lt;ref name="Nicolson p. 40" /&gt;  Within relationships of intimate terrorism and violent resistance, 96% of the violent resisters are women.&lt;ref name="Howe p. 370" /&gt; VR can occur as an instinctive reaction in response to an initial attack or a defense mechanism after prolonged instances of violence.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Michael P.|date=July 2011|title=Gender and types of intimate partner violence: A response to an anti-feminist literature review|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.avb.2011.04.006|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|volume=16|issue=4|pages=289–296|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2011.04.006|issn=1359-1789}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of resistance can sometimes become fatal if the victim feels as though their only way out is to kill their partner. &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

===Situational couple violence===
{{See also|Teen dating violence}}
Situational couple violence, also called common couple violence, is not connected to general control behavior, but arises in a single argument where one or both partners physically lash out at the other.&lt;ref name="Howe p. 370" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicolson p. 40" /&gt; This is the most common form of intimate partner violence, particularly in the western world and among young couples, and involves members of both sexes nearly equally. Among college students, Johnson found it to be perpetrated about 44% of the time by women and 56% of the time by men.&lt;ref name="Howe p. 370" /&gt;

Johnson states that situational couple violence involves a relationship dynamic "in which conflict occasionally gets 'out of hand,' leading usually to 'minor' forms of violence, and rarely escalating into serious or life-threatening forms of violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Johnson | first = Michael P. | author-link = Michael P. Johnson | title = Patriarchal terrorism and common couple violence: two forms of violence against women | journal = [[Journal of Marriage and Family]] | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 283–294 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] for the National Council on Family Relations | doi = 10.2307/353683 | jstor = 353683 | date = May 1995 | url= https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/353683 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.personal.psu.edu/mpj/1995%20JMF.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In situational couple violence, acts of violence by men and women occur at fairly equal rates, with rare occurrences of injury, and are not committed in an attempt to control a partner.&lt;ref name="olson"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Olson | first = Loreen N. | title = Exploring "common couple violence" in heterosexual romantic relationships | journal = Western Journal of Communication | volume = 66 | issue = 1 | pages = 104–128 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/10570310209374727 | date = March 2002 | url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10570310209374727 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is estimated that approximately 50% of couples experience situational couple violence in their relationships.&lt;ref name="olson"/&gt;

Situational couple violence involves:

* Mode: Mildly aggressive behavior such as throwing objects, ranging to more aggressive behaviors such as pushing, slapping, biting, hitting, scratching, or hair pulling.
* Frequency: Less frequent than partner terrorism, occurring once in a while during an argument or disagreement.
* Severity: Milder than intimate terrorism, very rarely escalates to more severe abuse, generally does not include injuries that were serious or that caused one partner to be admitted to a hospital.
* Mutuality: Violence may be equally expressed by either partner in the relationship.
* Intent: Occurs out of anger or frustration rather than as a means of gaining control and power over the other partner.

===Mutual violent control===
Mutual violent control (MVC) is rare type of intimate partner violence occurring when both partners act in a violent manner, battling for control.&lt;ref name="Nicolson p. 40" /&gt;

=== Reciprocal and non-reciprocal ===
The CDC divides domestic violence into two types: reciprocal, in which both partners are violent, and non-reciprocal violence, in which one partner is violent.&lt;ref name="Straus_Dom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.2105/AJPH.2005.079020"/&gt; Of the four types, situational couple violence and mutual violent control are reciprocal, while intimate terrorism is non-reciprocal. Violent resistance on its own is non-reciprocal, but is reciprocal when in response to intimate terrorism.

== By gender ==

Researchers such as [[Michael Kimmel|Michael S Kimmel]] have criticized CTS methodology in assessing relations between gender and domestic violence. Kimmel argued that the CTS excluded two important facets in gender violence: conflict-motivated aggression and control motivated aggression.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The first facet is a form of family conflict (such as an argument) while the latter is using violence as a tool for control. Kimmel also argued that the CTS failed to assess for the severity of the injury, sexual assaults and abuse from ex-partners or spouses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Women generally suffer more severe and long-lasting forms of partner abuse than men, and men generally have more opportunities to leave an abusive partner than women do.{{refn|name=Wallace &amp; Robertson 2016}} Researchers have found different outcomes in men and women in response to such abuse. A 2012 review from the journal ''[[Psychology of Violence]]'' found that women suffered from over-proportionate numbers of injuries, fear, and [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress]] as a result of partner violence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caldwell|first=Jennifer E.|date=January 2012|title=Gender differences in intimate partner violence outcomes|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0026296|journal=[[Psychology of Violence]]|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] via [[PsycINFO|PsycNET]]|volume=2|issue=1|pages=42–45|doi=10.1037/a0026296|postscript=.|ref=harv}} [http://people.cas.sc.edu/swansc/1.swan_web_articles/2012_CaldwellSwan_GenderDiffIPVOutcomes.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; The review also found that 70% of female victims felt frightened as a result of violence perpetrated by their partners whereas 85% of male victims expressed "no fear" in response to such violence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lastly, IPV correlated with relationship satisfaction for women but it did not do so for men.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to government statistics from the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]], male perpetrators constituted 96% of federal prosecution on domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvs02.pdf|title=Family violence statistics including statistics on strangers and acquaintances|last=Durose|first=Matthew R|date=2005|website=bjs.gov|publisher=US Department of Justice|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another report by the [[United States Department of Justice|US department of Justice]] on non-fatal domestic violence from 2003–2012 found that 76% of domestic violence was committed against women and 24% was committed against men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ndv0312.pdf|title=Nonfatal Domestic Violence, 2003–2012|last=Truman|first=Jennifer L|date=2014|website=bjs.gov|publisher=US Department of Justice|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], the percentage of victims killed by their spouses or ex-spouses was 77.4% for women and 22.6% for men in selected countries across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/documents/congress/background-information/Crime_Statistics/Global_Study_on_Homicide_2011.pdf|title=Global study on homicide|last=Gibbons|first=Jonathan|date=2011|website=unodc.org|publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (Vienna)|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Globally, men's perpetration of intimate partner violence against women often stems from conceptions of masculinity and patriarchy.

=== Gender symmetry ===
{{See also|Domestic violence against men#Gender symmetry}}The theory that women perpetrate intimate partner violence (IPV) at roughly the same rate as men has been termed "gender symmetry." The earliest empirical evidence of gender symmetry was presented in the 1975 U.S. National Family Violence Survey carried out by [[Murray A. Straus]] and [[Richard James Gelles|Richard J. Gelles]] on a nationally representative sample of 2,146 "intact families." The survey found 11.6% of men and 12% of women had experienced some kind of IPV in the last twelve months, while 4.6% of men and 3.8% of women had experienced "severe" IPV.&lt;ref name="National"&gt;{{citation|title=Intimate violence: the causes and consequences of abuse in the American family|url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/Straus-Intimate%20Partner%20Violence-Book.pdf|year=1988|ref=harv|postscript=.|last1=Gelles|last2=Straus|first1=Richard J.|first2=Murray A.|page=104|contribution=How violent are American families?|location=New York|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=9780671682965|editor-last1=Gelles|editor-first1=Richard J.|editor-last2=Straus|editor-first2=Murray A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thirty years"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Straus|first=Murray A.|date=June 2010|title=Thirty years of denying the evidence on gender symmetry in partner violence: implications for prevention and treatment|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/springer/vav/1991/00000006/00000002/art00003|journal=Partner Abuse|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|volume=1|issue=3|pages=332–362|doi=10.1891/1946-6560.1.3.332|postscript=.|ref=harv}} [http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/V71-Straus_Thirty-Years-Denying-Evidence-PV_10.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|333}}

The authors found that when partner abuse is defined broadly to include emotional abuse, any kind of hitting, and who hits first, partner abuse is relatively even.

Sexual violence by intimate partners varies by country and can reach as high as 25% of the women having been subject to forced sex. In some countries forced sex, or marital rape, often occurs with other forms of domestic violence, particularly physical abuse.

==Treatment==

===Individual treatment===

Due to the high prevalence and devastating consequences of IPV, approaches to decrease and prevent violence from re-occurring is of upmost importance. Initial police response and arrest is not always enough to protect victims from recurrence of abuse; thus, many states have mandated participation in batterer intervention programs (BIPs) for men who have been charged with assault against an intimate partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zarling|first=Amie|last2=Bannon|first2=Sarah|last3=Berta|first3=Meg|title=Evaluation of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Domestic Violence Offenders.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/vio0000097|journal=Psychology of Violence|language=en|doi=10.1037/vio0000097}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these BIPs are based on the Duluth Model and incorporate some cognitive behavioral techniques.

The Duluth model is one of the most common current interventions for IPV. It represents a psycho-educational approach that was developed by paraprofessionals from information gathered from interviewing battered women in shelters and using principles from feminist and sociological frameworks.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=pBjZSdZ1LsEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=).+Education+groups+for+men+who+batter:+The+Duluth+model&amp;ots=fQnu6Ou9XE&amp;sig=Y5ubS5ovAdoGA4jN4KpnzzqGbRY#v=onepage&amp;q=).%20Education%20groups%20for%20men%20who%20batter:%20The%20Duluth%20model&amp;f=false|title=Education Groups for Men Who Batter: The Duluth Model|last=Pence|first=Ellen|last2=Paymar|first2=Michael|date=1993-04-06|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=9780826179913|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main components used in the Duluth Model is the 'power and control wheel,' which conceptualizes IPV as one form of abuse to maintain male privilege. Using the 'power and control wheel,' the goal of treatment is to achieve behaviors that fall on the 'equality wheel' by re-educate men and by replacing maladaptive attitudes held by men.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) techniques focus on modifying faulty or problematic cognitions, beliefs, and emotions to prevent future violent behavior and include skills training such as anger management, assertiveness, and relaxation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist perspectives on wife abuse|last=Adams|first=David|publisher=Sage Publications|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=176–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the addition of Duluth and CBT approaches results in a 5% reduction in IPV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Babcock|first=Julia C|last2=Green|first2=Charles E|last3=Robie|first3=Chet|title=Does batterers' treatment work? A meta-analytic review of domestic violence treatment|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2002.07.001|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=23|issue=8|pages=1023–1053|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2002.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This low reduction rate might be explained, at least in part, by the high prevalence of bidirectional violence&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; as well as client-treatment matching versus “one-size-fits-all” approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cornell|first=Dewey G.|last2=Warren|first2=Janet|last3=Hawk|first3=Gary|last4=Stafford|first4=Ed|last5=Oram|first5=Guy|last6=Pine|first6=Denise|title=Psychopathy in instrumental and reactive violent offenders.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-006X.64.4.783|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|volume=64|issue=4|pages=783–790|doi=10.1037/0022-006x.64.4.783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Achieving change through values-based behavior (ACTV) is a newly developed Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)-based program. Developed by domestic violence researcher Amie Zarling and colleagues at Iowa State University, the aim of ACTV is teach abusers "situational awareness"—to recognize and tolerate uncomfortable feelings – so that they can stop themselves from exploding into rage.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/10/21/558623534/iowa-tries-a-new-domestic-violence-intervention-mindfulness|title=Iowa Tries A New Domestic Violence Intervention: Mindfulness|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial evidence of the ACTV program has shown high promise: Using a sample 3,474 men who were arrested for domestic assault and court-mandated to a BIP (either ACTV or Duluth/CBT), Zarling and colleagues showed that compared with Duluth/CBT participants, significantly fewer ACTV participants acquired any new charges, domestic assault charges, or violent charges. ACTV participants also acquired significantly fewer charges on average in the 1 year after treatment than Duluth/CBT participants.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Conjoint treatment===

Some estimates show that as many as 50% of couples who experience IPV engage in some form of reciprocal violence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Nevertheless, most services address offenders and survivors separately. In addition, many couples who have experienced IPV decide to stay together. These couples may present to couples or family therapy. In fact, 37-58% of couples who seek regular outpatient treatment have experienced physical assault in the past year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prevalence of partner aggression in representative and clinic samples.|last=Jose O'Leary|first=|publisher=APA|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=15–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, clinicians are faced with the decision as to whether they should accept or refuse to treat these couples. Although the use of conjoint treatment for IPV is controversial as it may present a danger to victims and potentially escalate abuse, it may be useful to others, such as couples experiencing situational couple violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stith|first=Sandra M.|last2=McCollum|first2=Eric E.|date=2011-07-01|title=Conjoint treatment of couples who have experienced intimate partner violence|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178911000644|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|series=Current Controversies on the Role of Gender in Partner Violence|volume=16|issue=4|pages=312–318|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2011.04.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars and practitioners in the field call for tailoring of interventions to various sub-types of violence and individuals served.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCollum|first=Eric E.|last2=Stith|first2=Sandra M.|date=2007-06-25|title=Conjoint Couple's Treatment for Intimate Partner Violence|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J398v06n01_07|journal=Journal of Couple &amp; Relationship Therapy|volume=6|issue=1-2|pages=71–82|doi=10.1300/J398v06n01_07|issn=1533-2691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral couple's therapy (BCT) is cognitive-behavioral approach, typically delivered to outpatients in 15-20 sessions over several months. Research suggests that BCT can be effective in reducing IPV when used to treat co-occurring addictions, which is important work because IPV and substance abuse and misuse frequently co-occur.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Domestic conflict containment program (DCCP) is a highly structured skills-based program whose goal is to teach couples conflict containment skills.

Physical aggression couples treatment (PACT) is a modification of DCCP, which includes additional psychoeducational components designed to improve relationship quality, including such things as communication skills, fair fighting tactics, and dealing with gender differences, sex, and jealousy.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The primary goal of domestic violence focused couples treatment (DVFCT) is to end violence with the additional goal of helping couples improve the quality of their relationships. It is designed to be conducted over 18 weeks and can be delivered in either individual or multi-couple group format.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stith, S. M., McCollum, E. E., Rosen, K. H., Locke, L., &amp; Goldberg, P. (2005). Domestic violence focused couples treatment. ''Handbook of clinical family therapy'', 406-430.

The '''is–ought problem''', as articulated by the Scottish [[philosopher]] and [[historian]] [[David Hume]] (1711–76), states that many writers make claims about what ''ought'' to be, based on statements about what ''is''. Hume found that there seems to be a significant difference between [[Positive statement|positive]] statements (about what is) and prescriptive or [[normative]] statements (about what ought to be), and that it is not obvious how one can coherently move from descriptive statements to prescriptive ones. The is–ought problem is also known as '''Hume's law''', '''Hume's guillotine''' or '''fact–value gap'''.

A similar view is defended by [[G. E. Moore]]'s [[open-question argument]], intended to refute any identification of [[moral]] properties with natural [[properties]]. This so-called [[naturalistic fallacy]] stands in contrast to the views of [[ethical naturalism|ethical naturalists]].

==Overview==
Hume discusses the problem in book III, part I, section I of his book, ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' (1739):

{{quote|In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remarked, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations concerning human affairs; when of a sudden I am surprised to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, ''is'', and ''is not'', I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an ''ought'', or an ''ought not''. This change is imperceptible; but is, however, of the last consequence. For as this ''ought'', or ''ought not'', expresses some new relation or affirmation, 'tis necessary that it should be observed and explained; and at the same time that a reason should be given, for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it. But as authors do not commonly use this precaution, I shall presume to recommend it to the readers; and am persuaded, that this small attention would subvert all the vulgar systems of morality, and let us see, that the distinction of vice and virtue is not founded merely on the relations of objects, nor is perceived by reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|chapter=Section 1|wslink=Treatise of Human Nature/Book 3: Of morals/Part 1|plaintitle=Treatise of Human Nature|last= Hume |first= David |authorlink = David Hume |year=|publisher=|page=469-470|wspage=|scan=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Hume |first = David |authorlink = David Hume |title = A Treatise of Human Nature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Sp8B0ZdyAYC&amp;pg=PA335#v=snippet&amp;q=%22every%20system%20of%20morality%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=2011-12-06 |year = 1739 |publisher = John Noon |location= London |page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;!-- Please note before you "fix" it, that the preceding is a direct quote and that the words used in the text are so abbreviated --&gt;

[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Hume asks, given knowledge of the way the universe ''is'', in what sense can we say it ''ought to be'' different? (photograph, ''[[Earthrise]]'')]]Hume calls for caution against such inferences in the absence of any explanation of how the ought-statements follow from the is-statements. But how exactly ''can'' an "ought" be derived from an "is"? The question, prompted by Hume's small paragraph, has become one of the central questions of ethical theory, and Hume is usually assigned the position that such a derivation is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Priest |title=The British Empiricists |pages=177–78 |publisher=Routledge |location= |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-415-35723-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This complete severing of "is" from "ought" has been given the graphic designation of ''Hume's Guillotine''.&lt;ref name="Black1964"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Black|first1=Max|title=The Gap Between "Is" and "Should"|journal=The Philosophical Review|volume=73|issue=2|year=1964|page=165|issn=0031-8108|doi=10.2307/2183334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
The apparent gap between "is" statements and "ought" statements, when combined with [[Hume's fork]], renders "ought" statements of dubious validity. Hume's fork is the idea that all items of knowledge are based either on logic and definitions, or else on observation. If the is–ought problem holds, then "ought" statements do not seem to be known in either of these two ways, and it would seem that there can be no moral knowledge. [[Moral skepticism]] and [[non-cognitivism]] work with such conclusions.

==Responses==

===Oughts and goals===
[[File:Alonzo Babers finish.JPEG|thumb|left|150px|Few debate that one ''ought'' to run quickly ''if'' one's goal is to win a race. A tougher question may be whether one "morally ought" to want to win a race in the first place.]]
[[Ethical naturalists]] contend that moral truths exist, and that their truth value relates to facts about physical reality. Many modern naturalistic philosophers see no impenetrable barrier in deriving "ought" from "is", believing it can be done whenever we analyze goal-directed behavior. They suggest that a statement of the form ''"In order for agent ''A'' to achieve goal ''B'', ''A'' reasonably ought to do ''C''"'' exhibits no [[category error]] and may be factually verified or refuted. "Oughts" exist, then, in light of the existence of goals. A counterargument to this response is that it merely pushes back the 'ought' to the subjectively valued 'goal' and thus provides no fundamentally objective basis to one's goals which, consequentially, provides no basis of distinguishing moral value of fundamentally different goals. A possible basis for an objective, moral realist, morality might be an appeal to [[teleonomy]].

This is similar to work done by moral philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], who attempts to show that because ethical language developed in the West in the context of a belief in a human [[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]—an end or goal—our inherited moral language, including terms such as good and bad, have functioned, and function, to evaluate the way in which certain behaviors facilitate the achievement of that telos. In an evaluative capacity, therefore, good and bad carry moral weight without committing a category error. For instance, a pair of scissors that cannot easily cut through paper can legitimately be called bad since it cannot fulfill its purpose effectively. Likewise, if a person is understood as having a particular purpose, then behaviour can be evaluated as good or bad in reference to that purpose. In plainer words, a person is acting good when that person fulfills that person's purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacIntyre |first=Alasdair |title=After Virtue: A Study in Moral Philosophy |location=Notre Dame, IN |publisher=University of Notre Dame Press |year=1981 |pages=148–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if the concept of an "ought" is meaningful, this need not involve morality. This is because some goals may be morally neutral, or (if they exist) against what is moral. A poisoner might realize his victim has not died and say, for example, "I ought to have used more poison," since his goal is to murder. The next challenge of a moral realist is thus to explain what is meant by a "''moral'' ought".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=H. L. A. Hart |last=Hart |first=H. L. A. |title=The Concept of Law |year=1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discourse ethics===
{{Main article|Discourse ethics}}
Proponents of discourse ethics argue that the very act of discourse implies certain "oughts", that is, certain [[presupposition]]s that are necessarily accepted by the participants in discourse, and can be used to further derive prescriptive statements. They therefore argue that it is incoherent to argumentatively advance an ethical position on the basis of the is–ought problem, which contradicts these implied assumptions.

As MacIntyre explained, someone may be called a good person if people have an inherent purpose. Many ethical systems appeal to such a purpose. This is true of some forms of [[moral realism]], which states that something can be wrong, even if every thinking person ''believes'' otherwise (the idea of [[brute fact]] about morality). The ethical realist might suggest that humans were created for a purpose (e.g. to serve God), especially if they are an [[ethical non-naturalist]]. If the ethical realist is instead an [[ethical naturalist]], they may start with the fact that humans have [[evolved]] and pursue some sort of [[evolutionary ethics]] (which risks “committing” the [[moralistic fallacy]]).
Not all moral systems appeal to a human telos or purpose. This is because it is not obvious that people even ''have'' any sort of natural purpose, or what [[Teleology|that purpose]] would be. Although many scientists do recognize [[teleonomy]] (a tendency in nature), few philosophers appeal to it (this time, to avoid the naturalistic fallacy).

[[File:The Posts - geograph.org.uk - 116024.jpg|thumb|Even if oughts can be understood in relation to goals or needs, the greater challenge of ethical systems remains that of defining the nature and origins of the good, and in what sense one ought to pursue it.]]
Goal-dependent oughts run into problems even without an appeal to an innate human purpose. Consider cases where one has no desire to be good—whatever it is. If, for instance, a person wants to be good, and good means washing one's hands, then it seems one morally ought to wash their hands. The bigger problem in moral philosophy is what happens if someone does ''not'' want to be good, whatever its origins? Put simply, in what sense ''ought'' we to hold the goal of being good? It seems one can ask "how am I rationally required to hold 'good' as a value, or to pursue it?"&lt;ref&gt;These ideas are discussed extensively in {{cite book |first=Richard |last=Joyce |title=The Myth of Morality |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue above mentioned is a result of an important [[ethical relativist]] critique. Even if "oughts" depend on goals, the ought seems to vary with the person's goal. This is the conclusion of the [[ethical subjectivist]], who says a person can only be called good according to whether they fulfill their own, ''self-assigned'' goal. Alasdair MacIntyre himself suggests that a person's purpose comes from their culture, making him a sort of ethical relativist.&lt;ref&gt;Discussed in {{cite book |authorlink=J. L. Mackie |first=J. L. |last=Mackie |title=Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong |year=1997 |location= |publisher= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethical relativists acknowledge local, institutional facts about what is right, but these are facts that can still vary by society. Thus, without an objective "moral goal", a moral ought is difficult to establish. [[G. E. M. Anscombe]] was particularly critical of the word "ought" for this reason; understood as "We need such and such, and the only way to get it is this way"—a person may need something immoral, or else find that their noble need requires immoral action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Elizabeth |last=Anscombe |year=1958 |title=Modern Moral Philosophy |journal=[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]] |volume=33 |issue=124 |pages=1–19 |jstor=3749051 |doi=10.1017/s0031819100037943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If moral goals depend on private assumptions or public agreement, so may morality as a whole. For example, Canada might call it good to maximize global welfare, where a citizen, Alice, calls it good to focus on herself, and then her family, and finally her friends (with little empathy for strangers). It does not seem that Alice can be objectively or rationally bound—without regard to her personal values ''nor'' those of groups of other people—to act a certain way. In other words, we may not be able to say "You just ''should'' do this". Moreover, persuading her to help strangers would necessarily mean appealing to values she already possesses (or else we would never even have a hope of persuading her).&lt;ref&gt;http://jetpress.org/v21/blackford3.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This is another interest of [[normative ethics]]—questions of [[Normative ethics#Binding force|binding forces]].

There may be responses to the above relativistic critiques. As mentioned above, ethical realists that are non-natural can appeal to God's purpose for humankind. On the other hand, naturalistic thinkers may posit that valuing people's well-being is somehow 'obviously' the purpose of ethics, or else the only relevant purpose worth talking about. This is the move made by [[natural law]], [[scientific moralist]]s and some [[utilitarians]].

===Institutional facts===
[[John Searle]] also attempts to derive "ought" from "is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Searle |first=John R. |title=How to Derive 'Ought' From 'Is' |journal=Philosophical Review |volume=73 |year=1964 |issue=1 |pages=43–58 |jstor=2183201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He tries to show that the act of making a promise places one under an obligation by definition, and that such an obligation amounts to an "ought". This view is still widely debated, and to answer criticisms, Searle has further developed the concept of [[institutional fact]]s, for example, that a certain building ''is'' in fact a bank and that certain paper ''is'' in fact money, which would seem to depend upon general recognition of those institutions and their value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Searle |first=John R. |year=1995 |title=The construction of social reality |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |isbn=0-02-928045-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indefinables===

Indefinables are concepts so global that they cannot be defined; rather, in a sense, they themselves, and the objects to which they refer, define our reality and our ideas.  Their meanings cannot be stated in a true definition, but their meanings can be referred to instead by being placed with their incomplete definitions in [[self-evident]] statements, the truth of which can be tested by whether or not it is impossible to think the opposite without a contradiction.  Thus, the truth of indefinable concepts and propositions using them is entirely a matter of logic.

An example of the above is that of the concepts "finite parts" and "wholes"; they cannot be defined without reference to each other and thus with some amount of circularity, but we can make the self-evident statement that "the whole is greater than any of its parts", and thus establish a meaning particular to the two concepts.

These two notions being granted, it can be said that statements of "ought" are measured by their ''prescriptive'' truth, just as statements of "is" are measured by their ''descriptive'' truth; and the descriptive truth of an "is" judgment is defined by its correspondence to reality (actual or in the mind), while the prescriptive truth of an "ought" judgment is defined according to a more limited scope—its correspondence to right desire (conceivable in the mind and able to be found in the rational appetite, but not in the more "actual" reality of things independent of the mind or rational appetite).&lt;ref name="prescriptive truths"&gt;see Aristotle's ''Nicomachean Ethics'' 6.2&lt;/ref&gt;

To some, this may immediately suggest the question: "How can we know what is a right desire if it is already admitted that it is not based on the more actual reality of things independent of the mind?" The beginning of the answer is found when we consider that the concepts "good", "bad", "right" and "wrong" are indefinables. Thus, right desire cannot be defined properly, but a way to refer to its meaning ''may'' be found through a self-evident prescriptive truth.&lt;ref name="definables"&gt;As an example of philosophical argumentation that identifies particular indefinables, we take "being" and then "good".  Aristotle stated that although being is not a genus (''Posterior Analytics'' 2.7), yet of everything that is, being is predicated (''Topics'' 4.1), and that the [[Genus-differentia definition]]s, of which he was the first recorded proponent, requires that its subject be defined through its genus and a differentia.  But since nothing lies outside of what is predicated of being, there is nothing which can serve as a differentia.  So being is postulated to be indefinable.  Later, Aquinas made an [[argument]] that stated, "Good and being are the really the same, and differ only according to reason....  [G]ood presents the aspect of desirableness, which being does not present." (''Summa Theologica'', Part I, Q. 5, Art. 1) So good is postulated to be indefinable.&lt;/ref&gt;

That self-evident truth which the moral cognitivist claims to exist upon which all other prescriptive truths are ultimately based is: ''One ought to desire what is really good for one and nothing else.'' The terms "real good" and "right desire" cannot be defined apart from each other, and thus their definitions would contain some degree of circularity, but the stated self-evident truth indicates a meaning particular to the ideas sought to be understood, and it is (the moral cognitivist might claim) impossible to think the opposite without a contradiction.  Thus combined with other descriptive truths of what is good (goods in particular considered in terms of whether they suit a particular end and the limits to the possession of such particular goods being compatible with the general end of the possession of the total of all real goods throughout a whole life), a valid body of knowledge of right desire is generated.&lt;ref name="self-evident"&gt;See for example Ruggiero, ''Thinking Critically about Ethical Issues'', 5th ed., Ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Functionalist counterexamples ===
Several counterexamples have been offered by philosophers claiming to show that there are cases when an "ought" logically follows from an "is." First of all, [[Hilary Putnam]], by tracing back the quarrel to Hume's dictum, claims fact/value entanglement as an objection, since the distinction between them entails a value. [[Arthur Prior|A. N. Prior]] points out, from the statement "He is a sea captain," it logically follows, "He ought to do what a sea captain ought to do."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alasdair MacIntyre]], ''After Virtue'' (2007), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] points out, from the statement "This watch is grossly inaccurate and irregular in time-keeping and too heavy to carry about comfortably," the evaluative conclusion validly follows, "This is a bad watch."&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.'', p. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; John Searle points out, from the statement "Jones promised to pay Smith five dollars," it logically follows that "Jones ought to pay Smith five dollars." The act of promising by definition places the promiser under obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Don MacNiven, ''Creative Morality'', pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral realism ===
[[Philippa Foot]] adopts a [[Moral realism|moral realist]] position, criticizing the idea that when evaluation is superposed on fact there has been a "committal in a new dimension."&lt;ref&gt;Philippa Foot, “Moral Beliefs,” ''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society'', vol. 59 (1958), pp. 83–104.&lt;/ref&gt;  She introduces, by analogy, the practical implications of using the word "injury." Not just anything counts as an injury. There must be some impairment. When we suppose a man wants the things the injury prevents him from obtaining, haven’t we fallen into the old naturalist fallacy?
{{quote|It may seem that the only way to make a necessary connection between 'injury' and the things that are to be avoided, is to say that it is only used in an 'action-guiding sense' when applied to something the speaker intends to avoid. But we should look carefully at the crucial move in that argument, and query the suggestion that someone might happen not to want anything for which he would need the use of hands or eyes. Hands and eyes, like ears and legs, play a part in so many operations that a man could only be said not to need them if he had no wants at all.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''., p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Foot argues that the virtues, like hands and eyes in the analogy, play so large a part in so many operations that it is implausible to suppose that a committal in a non-naturalist dimension is necessary to demonstrate their goodness.
{{quote|Philosophers who have supposed that actual action was required if 'good' were to be used in a sincere evaluation have got into difficulties over weakness of will, and they should surely agree that enough has been done if we can show that any man has reason to aim at virtue and avoid vice. But is this impossibly difficult if we consider the kinds of things that count as virtue and vice? Consider, for instance, the cardinal virtues, prudence, temperance, courage and justice. Obviously any man needs prudence, but does he not also need to resist the temptation of pleasure when there is harm involved? And how could it be argued that he would never need to face what was fearful for the sake of some good? It is not obvious what someone would mean if he said that temperance or courage were not good qualities, and this not because of the 'praising' sense of these words, but because of the things that courage and temperance are.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''., p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Misunderstanding ===
[[Hilary Putnam]] argues philosophers that accept Hume's "is–ought" distinction reject his reasons in making this, and thus undermine the entire claim.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Hilary (2003). ''The Collapse of the Fact-Value Dichotomy and Other Essays'', Harvard University Press, pp.21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various scholars have also indicated that, in the very work where Hume argues for the is–ought problem, Hume himself derives an "ought" from an "is".&lt;ref&gt;Baier, Annette. "Hume's Own 'Ought' Conclusions," in Hume on Is and Ought&lt;/ref&gt;  Such seeming inconsistencies in Hume have led to an ongoing debate over whether Hume actually held to the is–ought problem in the first place, or whether he meant that ought inferences can be made but only with good argumentation.&lt;ref&gt;Pidgen, Charles. "Hume on Is and Ought"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kinderstern'''''/'''''Star for Children''''', is an artwork the German artist [[Imi Knoebel]] has created since 1988. The artwork is entirely donated to projects for children in need. The Star for Children has so far collected donations of four million Euros and is the only artwork worldwide which proceeds go a 100% to children in need. The "Star for Children in Need" receives support through artists and collectors, musicians and actors/actresses,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/print-wams/article617615/Der_Stern_fuer_Kinder_in_Not.html ''Der Stern für Kinder in Not'', viewed 11.21.2011]&lt;/ref&gt; museums like [[Deutsche Guggenheim]] in Berlin and Sammlung Grässlin in the Blackforest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutsche-guggenheim.de/assets-alt/pdf/DGM7.pdf ''Stars for Children in Need'' accessdate=November 21, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611140110/http://www.deutsche-guggenheim.de/assets-alt/pdf/DGM7.pdf |date=June 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Kunst tut gut'' Museum Fridericianum Kassel 1995&lt;/ref&gt; and art fairs.&lt;ref&gt;''Ein Kinderstern für Tschernobyl-Opfer'' Art Frankfurt 1993, Frankfurter Rundschau 25.

==Leitmotif==
Kinderstern stands for the [[Children's rights]] .

==Idea==
[[File:Kinderstern 1991.jpg|thumb|Drawing by Johannes Stuettgen. Art transforms itself to stand for the Children's rights]]
The Kinderstern  is a [[Social sculpture]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-jena.de/060519_Knoebel.html ''Bildbegriff der Moderne zu erweitern und mit der Idee der Sozialen Plastik seines Lehrers zu versöhnen sucht'', accessdate=November 22, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;  realizing the extended notion of art, formulated 1967 by  [[Joseph Beuys]], by which art also ought to change society. Donations given to Kinderstern transform the donated money to being a Bearer of the Right of a Child, exposing a deeper purpose of money: Bearer of Human Rights. Kinderstern stands for the Rights and dignity of all Children. It stands for the right of a home, of food, of generous attention, medical care, and education. This patronage unifies unredeemed Rights of Children,  Kinderstern is their artwork in times of need.

==History==
[[File:P1010136 rgb 72dpi.jpg|thumb|Kinderstern on tour 2011]]

In 1988, the Star for Children was printed for the first time as silkscreen in red. This print was, next to original prints from the artists [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Jörg Immendorff]],  [[Sigmar Polke]], [[Max Bill]], [[Heinz Mack]], [[Keith Haring]], part of a portfolio created under the auspices of [[Lothar Späth]],&lt;ref&gt;''Kinderstern'' Zeitschrift für Allgemeinmedizin, 15. Januar 1990&lt;/ref&gt; minister-president of Baden-Württemberg/Germany. Title of the portfolio: „Kinderstern“/Star for Children . Its proceeds supported the financing of accommodations for parents close to pediatric clinics.
Imi Knoebels artistic intention that lead and tied him to the Star for Children went beyond the first project. His intention aimed at continuity and expansion. Star for Children became the aggenda with the promise to actively step into the breach in the name of children. In the same year with headquarters in Düsseldorf a non-profit organization was founded under the name Kinderstern/Star for Children . Their responsibilities included detecting projects of non-profit organizations already carried out serving children in need. Imi Knoebel, as the artistic initiator not a member, committed himself to continuously producing stars for the non profit organization. Almost every year new Stars for Children are released in limited colors. These Stars for Children are donated as an appreciation to all contributors who support the agenda of the Star for Children.

'''Latrell Fontaine Sprewell''' (born September 8, 1970) is an American former professional [[basketball]] player; he played for the [[Golden State Warriors]], the [[New York Knicks]],  and the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]]. During his time as a professional, Sprewell was named to the yearly [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] All-Star game four times; he also helped the Knicks reach the [[NBA Finals]] and the Timberwolves the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] finals. Despite his accomplishments, his career was overshadowed by a 1997 incident in which he choked coach [[P. J. Carlesimo]] during a practice, which ultimately resulted in a 68-game suspension.

Sprewell's career came to an unexpected end in 2005 when he refused a $21-million three-year contract offer from the Timberwolves, which Sprewell implied would not be enough to feed his children. The Timberwolves offered him nothing more. Since that time, he has made headlines for grounding his million-dollar yacht and subsequently having it repossessed for missed payments, having two of his homes foreclosed upon, and being prohibited from seeing his children.&lt;ref name="Ostler"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2007/08/23/SPGT3RNR151.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Scott | last=Ostler | title=Captain Spree should remain a landlubber | date=August 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NBA career==

===Golden State Warriors===
After attending [[Washington High School (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|Washington High School]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], Sprewell played competitively with the [[Three Rivers Community College (Missouri)|Three Rivers Community College]] Raiders Basketball Team in [[Poplar Bluff, Missouri]] from 1988&amp;ndash;1990, and from 1990&amp;ndash;1992 with the [[University of Alabama]], where he was a teammate of future NBA players [[Robert Horry]], [[Jason Caffey]] and [[James Robinson (basketball)|James Robinson]].

He was selected 24th overall in the [[1992 NBA draft]] by the [[1992–93 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]]. Sprewell, nicknamed "Spree", made an immediate impact, starting 69 of the 77 games he played in during his rookie season and averaging 15.4 points per game. His performance would improve over the next few years, leading the team in scoring and playing for the Western Conference All-Star team in 1994, 1995, and 1997, scoring 24.2 ppg in 1996–97, fifth in the league. Additionally, in 1993–1994 he led the league in games played and minutes per game as the Warriors, led by Sprewell and NBA Rookie of the year [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Chris Webber]], made it back to the [[1994 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]]. They would, however, lose in the first round to the [[1993–94 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]] in three games.

====1997 choking incident====
Though a four-time All-Star, a significant blemish on Sprewell's career was an incident that took place on December 1, 1997, when he attacked head coach [[P. J. Carlesimo]] during a Warriors practice. When Carlesimo yelled at Sprewell to make crisper passes (specifically asking him to "put a little mustard" on a pass),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Report: Sonics set to make Spurs assistant Carlesimo coach |url=http://www.sportsline.com/nba/story/10245270 |work=[[CBSSports.com]] |date=July 3, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212024621/http://www.sportsline.com/nba/story/10245270 |archivedate=December 12, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sprewell responded that he was not in the mood for criticism and told the coach to keep his distance. When Carlesimo approached, Sprewell threatened to kill him and dragged him backwards by his throat, choking him for 7–10 seconds before his teammates and assistant coaches pulled Sprewell off his coach. Sprewell returned about 20 minutes later after showering and changing and again accosted Carlesimo. He landed a glancing blow at Carlesimo's right cheek before being dragged away again by the assistant coaches.  It was not his first violent incident with the Warriors; in 1995, Sprewell fought with teammate [[Jerome Kersey]] and returned to practice carrying a [[dimensional lumber|two-by-four]], and reportedly threatened to return with a gun.&lt;ref name="espn"/&gt; In a 1993 practice, Sprewell fought with [[Byron Houston]], who was 50 pounds heavier than Sprewell and had what many teammates describe as having a Mike Tyson-like demeanor and physique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1011658/2/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Video | date=December 15, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sprewell was suspended for 10 games without pay. However, the next day, in the wake of a public uproar, the Warriors voided the remainder of his contract altogether, which included $23.7 million over three years, and the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] suspended him for one year. Sprewell took the case to [[arbitration]] and the contract voiding was overturned, but the league did suspend him for the rest of the season without pay, which amounted to 68 games. He sought to vacate the arbitration contract under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. His case went through all appeals, and was remanded. During the time he was serving his suspension from the NBA, Sprewell was charged with [[reckless driving]] for his role in a 90-mile-per-hour accident that injured two people. He spent three months under house arrest as part of a no-contest plea.&lt;ref name="espn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AP, March 18, 1998; AP, July 28, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York Knicks===
Due to the [[1998–99 NBA season|NBA lockout]], Sprewell did not play again until February 1999,&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/38835785.html?dids=38835785:38835785&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Feb+06%2C+1999&amp;author=Associated+Press&amp;pub=Hartford+Courant&amp;desc=SPREWELL+CAN'T+SAVE+KNICKS+MAGIC+WIN+OPENER%3B+CAMBY%3A+10+SECONDS&amp;pqatl=google "Sprewell can't save Knicks"]. [[Associated Press]]. February 6, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; after the Warriors traded him to the [[1998–99 New York Knicks season|New York Knicks]] for [[John Starks (basketball)|John Starks]], [[Chris Mills (basketball)|Chris Mills]] and [[Terry Cummings]].  Sprewell played 37 games for the Knicks that season, playing off the bench in all but four games.

Many pundits felt that signing the volatile Sprewell was too big a gamble for the Knicks to take, but Sprewell himself vowed he was a changed man. The Knicks, who at the time still revolved around veteran All-Star [[center (basketball)|center]] [[Patrick Ewing]], narrowly qualified for the [[1999 NBA Playoffs|1999 playoffs]], making the field as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference. The Knicks navigated past the [[1998–99 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]], [[1998–99 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta Hawks]] and finally the [[1998–99 Indiana Pacers season|Indiana Pacers]], making it as the first eighth seed in NBA history to the [[1999 NBA Finals]], where they met the [[1998–99 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]], who beat them in five games although Sprewell enjoyed a good series for the most part, averaging 26.0 ppg. He tallied 35 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in the Knicks' 78-77 Game 5 loss, and was subsequently featured on the cover of the September 1999 issue of ''[[SLAM Magazine]]''.

Sprewell moved into the Knicks' starting lineup for the [[1999–2000 NBA season|1999–2000 season]] at small forward, and averaged 18.6 points, helping the Knicks to a 50-32 record good enough for the third seed in the Eastern Conference led by Sprewell, Ewing and [[shooting guard]] [[Allan Houston]].  The Knicks navigated past the [[1999–2000 Toronto Raptors season|Toronto Raptors]] in three hard-fought games and the [[1999–2000 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]] in seven even harder-fought games in the first two rounds of the playoffs, en route to the Eastern Conference Finals against the [[1999–2000 Indiana Pacers season|Indiana Pacers]]. But their quest for back-to-back NBA Finals appearances came to an end when they were defeated by the Pacers in 6 games in the Eastern Conference Finals. Sprewell averaged 19.7 ppg in the series, and the Knicks gave him a five-year/$62 million contract extension.&lt;ref name="espn"/&gt;

The [[2000–01 NBA season|2000–01 season]] saw Sprewell step up as the Knicks' leader with Ewing traded to the [[2000–01 Seattle SuperSonics season|Seattle SuperSonics]], making his only All-Star appearance for the Knicks that year, scoring 17.7 points off the bench. However, despite another impressive season from Sprewell the Knicks would lose in the first round to the [[2000–01 Toronto Raptors season|Toronto Raptors]] in five games in those [[2001 NBA Playoffs|2001 playoffs]].  In [[2001–02 NBA season|2001–02]] Sprewell averaged 19.4 ppg, including 49 points in a game against the [[2001–02 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]], one of three times he scored 40 or more points that season; but it was not enough as the Knicks would miss the [[2002 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] for the first time in 15 years.

Prior to the [[2002–03 NBA season|2002–03 season]], Sprewell reported to training camp with a broken hand, which he claimed occurred when he slipped on his yacht; the Knicks fined him a record $250,000 for failing to report the incident to them. He then sued the ''[[New York Post]]'' for claiming he had broken his hand in a fight.&lt;ref name="espn"&gt;[http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Sprewell_Latrell.html ESPN Classic - Sprewell's Image Remains in a Chokehold&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Sprewell ultimately lost the lawsuit against the ''New York Post''.

That season, Sprewell made NBA history as he hit 9 of 9 three-point shots in one game, making the most three pointers without a single miss for the first time en route to a season-high 38 points versus the [[2002–03 Los Angeles Clippers season|Los Angeles Clippers]]. The record has since been tied by then-[[Chicago Bulls]] guard [[Ben Gordon (basketball)|Ben Gordon]] and broken by Nuggets guard [[Ty Lawson]], who made 10 threes without missing in a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. After that season, in which the Knicks missed the [[2003 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] for the second year in a row, Sprewell was traded to the [[2003–04 Minnesota Timberwolves season|Minnesota Timberwolves]] in a four-team trade involving [[Keith Van Horn]], [[Glenn Robinson]] and [[Terrell Brandon]].

===Minnesota Timberwolves===

In the [[2003–2004 NBA season|2003–04 season]], Sprewell became part of the league's highest-scoring trio alongside superstar [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Kevin Garnett]] and [[point guard]] [[Sam Cassell]]. With a 58-24 record, the Timberwolves qualified for the [[2004 NBA Playoffs|2004 playoffs]] as the top seed in the Western Conference. They navigated past the [[2003–04 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]] in five games, and [[2003–04 Sacramento Kings season|Sacramento Kings]] in seven, in the first two rounds of the playoffs. In the Western Conference Finals they met the [[2003–04 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]], who defeated them in six games thanks to miracle shooting by Laker superstar off-guard [[Kobe Bryant]], still the only appearance by the Timberwolves in the conference finals.  Sprewell finished third in team scoring at 16.8 ppg, behind Garnett's 24.2 and Cassell's 19.8.

On October 31, 2004, the [[2004–05 Minnesota Timberwolves season|Minnesota Timberwolves]] offered Sprewell a three-year, $21 million contract extension, substantially less than what his then-current contract paid him. Claiming to feel insulted by the offer he publicly expressed outrage, declaring, "I have a family to feed." He declined the extension and the Timberwolves offered him nothing more. Having once more drawn the ire of fans and sports media, Sprewell had the worst season of his career in the final year of his contract. In the summer of 2005, the [[2005–06 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]], [[2005–06 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cleveland Cavaliers]] and [[2005–06 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]] all expressed interest in signing Sprewell, but none ended up signing him.

One month into the [[2005–06 NBA season|2005–06 season]] and without a contract, Sprewell's agent, Bob Gist, said his client would rather retire than play for the NBA minimum salary, telling ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', "Latrell doesn't need the money that badly. To go from being offered $7 million to taking $1 million, that would be a slap in the face." Several days later, Gist said that Sprewell planned to wait until "teams get desperate" around the [[trade deadline]] in February, and then sign with a contending team -an eventuality that never materialized for him. Gist said that Sprewell would not be interested in signing for any team's $5 million [[NBA Salary Cap#Mid-level exception|mid-level exception]], calling that amount "a level beneath which [Sprewell] would not stoop or kneel!"

In March 2006, Sprewell was offered contracts by the [[2005–06 Dallas Mavericks season|Dallas Mavericks]] and [[2005–06 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]], both of whom were considered at the time to be strong favorites to win the [[NBA Finals|NBA Championship]], but Sprewell failed to respond and remained a free agent as the season came to a close. The [[2005–06 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]] also showed minimal interest in him at the start of that season, but nothing ever came of it.

Over the course of his career, Sprewell started 868 of the 913 games he played in, averaging 18.8 ppg, 4.2 apg and 4.1 rpg with playoff career averages of 19.7 ppg, 3.4 apg and 4.3 rpg. He was elected to the All-NBA First Team at the end of his second season, and to the All-NBA Defensive second team that same year.

==Personal life==
Sprewell's personal life since he last played in the NBA has been plagued with controversy and financial trouble. In 1994, his four-year-old daughter was attacked by his pet [[pit bull]] and bitten in her nose, lips, forehead and one ear, requiring surgery.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-10-27/sports/9410270221_1_bitten-pet-dog-candace-cabbil&lt;/ref&gt; Much earlier, while attending junior college, Sprewell had been arrested for stealing.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/1094/new-york-magazine-on-latrell-sprewell-in-1999&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, he appeared in a Priceline.com television advertisement, poking fun at himself.

===Relationships===
On August 30, 2006, [[Milwaukee]] police investigated a claim by a 21-year-old female who claimed that she and Sprewell were having consensual sex aboard his {{convert|70|ft|m|sing=on}} [[Yacht|yacht]], named ''Milwaukee's Best'', when Sprewell began to strangle her. Police allegedly observed red marks on her neck. Police investigating the allegation searched Sprewell's yacht for evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bob Purvis and Charles Gardner |title=Sprewell questioned in alleged assault |url=http://www.jsonline.com/watch/?watch=1&amp;date=8/30/2006&amp;id=10707 |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]   |date=August 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 6, police declined to press charges. Sprewell then sought a restraining order along with "civil remedies" against the accuser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bob Purvis |title=No charges against Sprewell |url=http://www.jsonline.com/watch/?watch=1&amp;date=9/6/2006&amp;id=11009 |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |date=September 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, 2007, Sprewell's long-term companion sued him for $200 million for ending their relationship agreement. She claimed Sprewell agreed to support her and their four children through college.&lt;ref name='Ostler'/&gt;

===Property===

On August 22, 2007, it was reported by multiple news agencies that Sprewell's yacht was repossessed by federal marshals after failing to continue paying for and insuring the vessel, for which he reportedly still owed approximately $1.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. marshal seizes Sprewell's $1.5M yacht |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20396558/ |work=[[msnbc.com]] |date=August 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, while piloted by Sprewell, the yacht ran ashore near Atwater Beach, just north of Milwaukee. Sprewell refused to contract with a professional salvage firm to remove the yacht, which was eventually freed with the help of a local fishing vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Erin Richards |title=Sprewell's yacht freed |url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=482234 |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |date=August 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008 the yacht was auctioned for $856,000 after Sprewell defaulted on a $1.5 million mortgage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=David Doege |title=Sprewell yacht sold at auction |url=http://milwaukee.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2008/02/11/newscolumn2.html?jst=pn_pn_lk |work=The Business Journal of Milwaukee |date=February 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three months later a Milwaukee area home owned by Sprewell went into [[foreclosure]] status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Marie Rohde |title=Latrell Sprewell's home foreclosed |url=http://blogs.jsonline.com/proofandhearsay/archive/2008/05/12/latrell-sprewell-s-home-foreclosed.aspx |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |date=May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between September 2007 and January 2008, according to documents, Sprewell had failed to make mortgage payments of $2,593 per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=Ex-NBA star Latrell Sprewell $1.5 million yacht, home could be foreclosed |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3241444 |work=[[ESPN NBA]] |date=February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009 a Westchester mansion owned by Sprewell went into foreclosure status,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Westchester Supreme Court Index No. 09-16447&lt;/ref&gt; but that action was dismissed on motion of another party's attorney, Roger K. Marion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

French secularism has a long history. For the last century, the French government policy has been based on the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]].&lt;ref name="georgetown1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/france |title=France |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |date= |accessdate=December 15, 2011}} See drop-down essay on "The Third Republic and the 1905 Law of Laïcité".&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{expand section|date=January 2017}}
Laïcité is a concept rooted in the [[French Revolution]], as it started to develop since the [[French Third Republic]], after the [[French Left|Republicans]] gained control of the state.

The word ''laïcité'' has been used, from the end of the 19th century on, to mean the freedom of public institutions, especially primary schools, from the influence of the [[Catholic Church]]&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt of ''Nouveau dictionnaire de pédagogie et d'instruction primaire'', 1911: {{cite web |url=http://www.premiumwanadoo.com/jeunes-laiques/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120907031723/http://www.premiumwanadoo.com/jeunes-laiques/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=10 |archivedate=2012-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in countries where it had retained its influence, in the context of a [[secularization]] process. Today, the concept covers other religious movements as well.

Proponents assert the French state secularism is based on respect for [[freedom of thought]] and [[freedom of religion]]. Thus the absence of a [[state religion]], and the subsequent [[separation of church and state|separation of the state and Church]], is considered by proponents to be a prerequisite for such freedom of thought. Proponents maintain that ''laïcité'' is thus distinct from [[anti-clericalism]], which actively opposes the influence of religion and the [[clergy]].  ''Laïcité'' relies on the division between [[Private sphere|private life]], where adherents believe religion belongs, and the [[public sphere]], in which each individual, adherents believe, should appear as a simple [[citizen]] [[Egalitarianism|equal]] to all other citizens, devoid of ethnic, religious or other particularities. According to this concept, the government must refrain from taking positions on [[religious doctrine]] and only consider religious subjects for their practical consequences on inhabitants' lives.

Supporters argue that ''laïcité'' by itself does not necessarily imply any hostility of the government with respect to religion. It is best described as a belief that government and political issues should be kept separate from religious organizations and religious issues (as long as the latter do not have notable social consequences). This is meant to protect both the government from any possible interference from religious organizations, and to protect the religious organization from political quarrels and controversies.

Critics of ''laïcité'' argue that it is a disguised form of [[anti-clericalism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/articles/555734/benedict-option-why-religious-right-considering-allout-withdrawal-from-politics|title=The Benedict Option: Why the religious right is considering an all-out withdrawal from politics|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and infringement on individual right to religious expression, and that, instead of promoting freedom of thought and freedom of religion, it prevents the believer from observing his or her religion.

Another critique is that, in countries historically dominated by one religious tradition, officially avoiding taking any positions on religious matters favors the dominant religious tradition of the relevant country. Even in the current [[French Fifth Republic]] (1958–), school [[holiday]]s mostly follow the Christian [[liturgical year]], that include [[Christmas and holiday season]]s, though Easter holidays have been replaced by Spring holidays which may or may not include Easter, depending on the vagaries of the liturgical calendar. However, schools have long given leave to students for important holidays of their specific non-majority religions, and food menus served in [[Education in France|secondary schools]] pay particular attention to ensuring that each religious observer may respect his religion's specific restrictions concerning diets.

Other countries, following in the French model, have forms of Laïcité – examples include Albania, Mexico and Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|accessdate=2012-02-10|last=Burma|first= Ian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YaC6-yO4mMEC&amp;dq |title=Taming the gods: religion and democracy on three continents|page= 111|publisher= Princeton Univ. Press|year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary French political secularism ==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
The principle of ''laïcité'' in France is implemented through a number of policies. The French government is legally prohibited from recognizing any ''religion'' (except for legacy statutes like those of military [[chaplain]]s and the [[Local law in Alsace-Moselle|local law]] of [[Alsace-Moselle]]). Instead, it recognizes ''religious organizations'', according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine:
* whether the sole purpose of the organization is to organize religious activities (so that, for instance, the pretense of being a religious organization is not used for [[tax evasion]])
* whether the organization disrupts public order.

[[Politics of France|French political leaders]], though not by any means prohibited from making religious remarks, mostly refrain from it. Religious considerations are generally considered incompatible with reasoned political debate. Political leaders may openly practice their religion but they are expected to differentiate their religious beliefs from their political arguments. [[Christine Boutin]], who openly argued on religious grounds against a legal [[PACS (civil union)|domestic partnership]] available regardless of the sex of the partners, quickly became the butt of late-night comedy jokes.

The term was originally the French equivalent of the term laity, that is, everyone who is not [[clergy]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} After the [[French Revolution]] this meaning changed and it came to mean keeping religion separate from the [[executive (government)|executive]], [[judicial]], and [[legislative]] branches of government. This includes prohibitions on having a state religion, as well as for the government to endorse any religious position, be it a religion or atheism.

Although the term was current throughout the 19th century, France did not fully separate church and state until the passage of its [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|1905 law on the separation of the Churches and the State]], prohibiting the state from recognizing or funding any religion. The notion of laïcité as a legal principle is open to question, because it is never defined as such by the text of a law.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Secularism Confronts Islam|last=Roy|first=Olivier|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-231-14102-4|location=New York Chichester, West Sussex|pages=17–18|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1905 law establishing separation did not use the word laïcité. It was not until the Constitution of 1946 (Constitution de 1946, IVe République) that the word appeared explicitly as a constitutional principle entailing legal effect, but without being further specified.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; All religious buildings in France (mostly Catholic churches, Protestant chapels, and Jewish synagogues) became the property of the city councils. Those now have the duty to maintain the (often historical) buildings but cannot subsidize the religious organizations using them. In areas that were part of [[Germany]] at that time, and which did not return to France until 1918, some arrangements for the cooperation of church and state are still in effect today (see [[Alsace-Moselle]]).

''Laïcité'' is a core concept in the [[French constitution]], Article 1 of which formally states that France is a secular republic ("''La France est une République indivisible, laïque, démocratique et sociale''.") This, however, does not prevent an active role on the part of the state (President of the Republic, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of the Interior) in the appointment of Catholic diocesan bishops – see [[Briand-Ceretti Agreement]]: the President of the French Republic is the only head of state in the world (except the Pope) who still appoints Catholic bishops (in Strasbourg and Metz); moreover, he is an honorary Canon in several cathedrals and basilicas, most notably in the Archbasilica of Saint John in Laterano, the Cathedral of the Pope. Many see being discreet with one's religion as a necessary part of being French. This has led to frequent divisions with some non-Christian immigrants, especially with part of France's large [[Muslim]] population. A debate took place over whether any religious apparel or displays by individuals, such as the Islamic [[hijab]], Sikh [[turban]], (large) [[Christian cross]]es, and Jewish [[Star of David|Stars of David]] and [[kippah]], should be banned from public schools. Such a ban came into effect in France in 2004; see [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools]]. In the spring of 2011 there was a reinforcement of ''laïcité'' in hospitals, advocated by the Minister of the Interior, Claude Guéant, and in public service generally, by the official non-discrimination agency, la HALDE. The simultaneous broadcasting of the traditional Protestant and Catholic Lent sermons (operating since 1946) has been interrupted. Earlier the broadcasting of the Russian Orthodox Christmas night liturgy was similarly stopped on 6/7 January.

The strict separation of church and state which began with the 1905 law has evolved into what some religious leaders see as a "form of political correctness that made bringing religion into public affairs a major taboo".&lt;ref name="christiantoday.com"&gt;Beita, Peter B. [http://www.christiantoday.com/article/french.presidents.religious.mixing.riles.critics/16423.htm French President's religious mixing riles critics] Christianity Today, Jan. 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Former President Sarkozy initially criticised this approach as a "negative laïcité" and wanted to develop a "positive laïcité" that recognizes the contribution of faith to French culture, history and society, allows for faith in the public discourse and for government subsidies for faith-based groups.&lt;ref name="christiantoday.com"/&gt; Sarkozy saw France's main religions as positive contributions to French society. He visited the [[Benedict XVI|pope]] in December 2007 and publicly acknowledged France's [[Catholic Church in France|Christian roots]], while highlighting the importance of [[freedom of thought]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/sarkozy.breaks.french.taboo.on.church.and.politics/15760.htm|title=Sarkozy breaks French taboo on church and politics - Christian News on Christian Today|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that [[faith]] should come back into the [[public sphere]]. In line with Sarkozy's views on the need for reform of ''laïcité'', [[Pope Benedict XVI]] on September 12, 2008 said it was time to revisit the debate over the relationship between church and state, advocating a "healthy" form of ''laïcité''.&lt;ref name="ncrcafe.org"&gt;{{citation|accessdate=2012-02-10|last=Allen|first=John L.|url=http://ncronline.org/node/12101| journal=[[National Catholic Reporter]]|date=2008-09-12|title=Pope in France: The case for 'healthy secularism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meeting with Sarkozy, he stated: "In fact, it is fundamental, on the one hand, to insist upon the distinction between the political realm and that of religion in order to preserve both the religious freedom of citizens and the responsibility of the state toward them."&lt;ref name="ncrcafe.org"/&gt; He went on: "On the other hand, [it is important] to become more aware of the irreplaceable role of religion for the formation of consciences and the contribution which it can bring to – among other things – the creation of a basic ethical consensus within society."&lt;ref name="ncrcafe.org"/&gt;

Sarkozy later changed footing on the place of religion in French society, by publicly declaring the [[burqa]] "not welcome" in France in 2009 and favoring legislation to outlaw it, following which in February 2010 a post office robbery took place by two [[burqa]]-clad robbers, ethnicity unknown, who after entering the post office removed their veils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/02/07/2812378.htm|title=Burqa-clad robbers hold up post office|work=ABC News|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following March 2011 local elections strong disagreement appeared within the governing UMP over the appropriateness of holding a debate on ''laïcité'' as desired by the President of the Republic. On 30 March a letter appeared in La Croix signed by representatives of six religious bodies opposing the appropriateness of such a debate.

A law was passed on April 11, 2011 with strong support from political parties as well as from Sarkozy which made it illegal to hide the face in public spaces, affecting a few thousand women in France wearing the [[niqab]] and the [[burqa]].

== State secularism in other countries ==

===Belgium===
{{main|Organized secularism}}
In [[Belgium]], {{-"}}''laïcité''{{-"}} refers to the [[Separation of church and state|separation between church and state]], although under the Belgian constitution ministers of religion are paid with government funds.

The constitution was amended in 1991 to give the same right to persons fulfilling [[Secular humanism|secular]] functions. Public schools must now offer pupils the choice between religion and secular courses.

=== Quebec (Canada) ===
{{Anchor|Québec}}
{{See also|Quiet Revolution}}
Public discourse in [[Quebec]], the only predominantly French-speaking province in Canada, has been greatly influenced by the ''laïcité'' of France since the 1960s.  Prior to this time, Quebec was seen as a very observant Catholic society, where Catholicism was a ''de facto'' state religion. Quebec then underwent a period of rapid secularization called the [[Quiet Revolution]]. Quebec politicians have tended to adopt a more European-style understanding of secularism than is practised elsewhere in Canada. This came to the fore during the debate on what constitutes the "[[reasonable accommodation (Quebec)|reasonable accommodation]]" of religious minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2011/10/secularism-and-its-discontents/|title=Secularism and its discontents – The McGill Daily|author=admin|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2013, the government of Quebec proposed Bill 60, the "Charter affirming the values of State secularism and religious neutrality and of equality between women and men, and providing a framework for
accommodation requests." The bill would alter the provincial human rights law to prohibit public employees from wearing objects that overtly indicate a religious preference. The people who would be most impacted by such a law would be Muslim women wearing a [[hijab]], Jewish men wearing a [[kippah]], and Sikh men (or women) wearing a [[turban]]. Employees who do not comply with the law would be terminated from their employment.

Bill 60 follows a European secularism model versus the United States model. Unlike secularism under the U.S. Constitution, it does not interpret ''laïcité'' to include a right to the "free exercise" of religion nor does it create a policy against governmental "establishment" of religion. The bill also leaves untouched current practices in Quebec that would violate the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, such as the use of public funds for private and religious schools and the creation of a values / ethics curriculum component in all secondary schools where students are regularly asked to give a profession of their religious faith. The party that had proposed the bill, the [[Parti Québécois]], was defeated in the 2014 election by the provincial Liberal party (who hold a majority of seats) which opposed the bill. As a result, the bill is considered 'dead'.

=== Mexico ===
Laïcité influenced in the [[Constitution of Mexico]]. In March 2010, the lower house of the Mexican legislature introduced legislation to amend the Constitution to make the Mexican government formally "laico" – meaning "lay" or "secular".&lt;ref name="offnews.info"&gt;Goodrich, Luke, [http://www.offnews.info/verArticulo.php?contenidoID=20974 Mexico's Separation of Church and State ] OffNews March 18, 2010, originally published in the Wall Street Journal&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics of the move say the "context surrounding the amendment suggests that it might be a step backwards for religious liberty and true separation of church and state".&lt;ref name="offnews.info"/&gt;

Coming on the heels of the Church's vocal objection to legalization of abortion as well as same sex unions and adoptions in Mexico City, "together with some statements of its supporters, suggests that it might be an attempt to suppress the Catholic Church's ability to engage in public policy debates".&lt;ref name="offnews.info"/&gt;  Mexico has had a [[History of Roman Catholicism in Mexico#Early period: The Spiritual Conquest 1519–1572|history of religious suppression and persecution]].  Critics of the amendment reject the idea that "Utilitarians, Nihilists, Capitalists, and Socialists can all bring their philosophy to bear on public life, but Catholics (or  religious minorities) must check their religion at the door" in a sort of "second-class citizenship" which they consider nothing more than religious discrimination.&lt;ref name="offnews.info"/&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
{{Main|Separation of church and state#Switzerland}}

=== Turkey ===
{{Main|Secularism in Turkey}}

In [[Turkey]], a strong stance of secularism ("Laiklik" in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]) has held sway since [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]'s [[Atatürk's reforms|Turkish revolution]] in the early 20th century. On March 3, 1924, Turkey removed the [[caliphate]] system and gradually after that, all religious influence from the state.  [[Sunni|Sunni Islam]], the majority religion, is now controlled by the Turkish government through the [[Diyanet İşleri Başkanlığı|Department of Religious Affairs]], and is state-funded while other religions or sects have independence on religious affairs. Islamic views which are deemed political are censored in accordance with the principle of secularism.

This system of Turkish laïcité permeates both the government and religious sphere. The content of the weekly sermons in all state funded mosques has to be approved by the state. Also, independent Sunni communities are illegal. Minority religions, like  [[Armenian Orthodox Church|Armenian]] or [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Greek Orthodox]]y, are guaranteed by the constitution as ''individual'' faiths and are mostly tolerated, but this guarantee does not give any rights to any ''religious communities'' including Muslim ones. Turkey's view is that the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] gives certain religious rights to [[Jews in Turkey|Jews]], [[Greeks in Turkey|Greeks]], and [[Armenians in Turkey|Armenians]] but not, for example, to Syrian-Orthodox or Roman Catholics, because the latter ones did not play any political roles during the treaty.  However the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] does not specify any nationality or ethnicity and simply identifies non-Muslims in general.

Recently, the desire to reestablish the [[Halki seminary|Greek Orthodox seminary on Heybeli Island near Istanbul]] became a political issue in regard to Turkey's accession to EU membership. The EU considers such prohibition to amount to suppression of religious freedom. However, it is pointed out that if Greek Orthodoxy is allowed to reopen a school it will become the only religion in Turkey with the right to an independent religious school. Recent attempts by the conservative government to outlaw [[adultery]] caused an outcry in Turkey and was seen as an attempt to legislate Islamic values, but others point out that the legislation was intended to combat [[polygamy]] which is still common in rural areas, although not recognized legally.

=== Contrast with the United States ===
{{Main|Separation of church and state in the United States}}
In the [[United States]], the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the Constitution contains a similar federal concept, although the term "laicity" is not used either in the Constitution or elsewhere, and is in fact used as a term to contrast European secularism with American secularism. That amendment includes clauses prohibiting both congressional governmental interference with the [[Free Exercise Clause|"free exercise"]] of religion, and congressional laws regarding the establishment of religion.  Originally this prevented the federal government from interfering with state-established religions.  But after the 14th amendment, these clauses have been held by the courts to [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|apply to both the federal and state governments]]. Together, the "free exercise clause" and "establishment clause" are considered to accomplish a "[[separation of church and state]]."

However, separation is not extended to bar religious conduct in public places or by public servants. Public servants, up to and including the [[President of the United States]], often make proclamations of religious faith. Sessions of both houses of the [[United States Congress]] and most state legislatures typically open with a prayer by a minister of some faith or other, and many if not most politicians and senior public servants in [[Washington, DC]] attend the annual [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Red Mass]] at the [[Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle]] regardless of their personal religious convictions. In contrast to France, the wearing of religious insignia in public schools is largely noncontroversial as a matter of law and culture in the U.S.; the main cases where there have been controversies are when the practice in question is potentially dangerous (for instance, the wearing of the [[Sikhism|Sikh]] ''[[kirpan]]'' knife in public places), and even then the issue is usually settled in favor of allowing the practice. In addition, the U.S. government regards religious institutions as tax-exempt non-profits,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|accessdate=2018-08-14|title=Publication 557|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p557|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; subject to limitations on their political involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|accessdate=2018-08-14|title=Revenue Ruling 2007-41|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-07-41.pdf|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, the military includes government-paid religious chaplains to provide for the spiritual needs of soldiers. In contrast to Europe, however, the government cannot display religious symbols (such as the cross) in public schools, courts and other government offices, although some exceptions are made (e.g. recognition of a cultural group's religious holiday). In addition, the [[United States Supreme Court]] has banned any activity in public schools and other government-run areas that can be viewed as a [[endorsement test|government endorsement of religion]].

The French philosopher and [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] co-drafter [[Jacques Maritain]], a devout Catholic convert and a critic of French laïcité, noted the distinction between the models found in France and in the mid-twentieth century United States.&lt;ref name="Christ And Culture Revisited"&gt;{{citation|accessdate=2012-02-10|last=Carson|first= D. A.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pIwE74bxvpAC&amp;dq|title= Christ And Culture Revisited|page= 189|publisher= Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|year= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He considered the US model of that time to be more amicable because it had both "sharp distinction and actual cooperation" between church and state, what he called "an historical treasure" and admonished the United States, "Please to God that you keep it carefully, and do not let your concept of separation veer round to the European one."&lt;ref name="Christ And Culture Revisited"/&gt;

== Biography ==

He was born March 5, 1940 in Skoplje. The war years he spent as a refugee with his mother (a teacher), and his sister in the areas around the Great Morava river, where he finished elementary school. In 1954 the whole family moved to [[Niš]], where he finished high school.

He graduated from the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law]] in 1963. For a time he studied Public International Law at the third instance of the same faculty. A member of the editorial board of the student culture periodical “Vidici”, he participated in the student uprising of 1968. His poem "March of the Red University" was multiplied in thousands of copies and adopted by acclamation at the Student Union at the Faculty of Philosophy as the anthem of the University of Belgrade.

In 1969 he founded the neo-avantgarde literary and artistic movement Signalism, and the following year he launched the International Review “Signal” publishing most important avant-garde authors [[Raoul Hausmann]], [[Augusto de Campos]], [[Michele Perfetti]], [[Adriano Spatola]], [[Clemente Padin]], [[Julien Blaine]], [[Sarenco]], [[Eugenio Miccini]], [[Richard Kostelanetz]], [[Guillermo Deisler]], [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Eugen Gomringer]], [[Pierre Garnier]], [[Enzo Minarelli]], [[Keiichi Nakamura]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Dmitry Bulatov (artist)|Dmitry Bulatov]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Shozo Shimamoto]], [[Klaus Peter Dencker]], [[Ruggero Maggi]], [[Daniel Daligand]], [[Willi R. Melnikov]], [[Kum-Nam Baik]], [[On Kawara]], [[Klaus Groh]] etc.

He worked as a journalist, a high school teacher, secretary of the editorial board, editor and advisor for Interstate and International Cultural Cooperation of the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Serbia. In 1982 he retired and fully devoted himself to literary and artistic work.

Poetry, essays, and intermedia works of Miroljub Todorović have been published in several languages: in anthologies, collections, catalogs, newspapers and magazines in Europe, North and South America, Australia, South Korea and Japan.

As an artist, he had a dozen solo exhibitions and participated in more than six hundred collective international exhibitions of drawings, collages, visual poetry, mail-art and conceptual art.

He is included in the biographical dictionary “Serbs Who Have Marked the Twentieth Century” (five hundred persons), Belgrade 2006.

Money is historically an [[Emergence#Money|emergent market phenomenon]] establishing a [[commodity money]], but nearly all contemporary money systems are based on [[fiat money]].&lt;ref name="mankiw"/&gt; Fiat money, like any check or note of debt, is without [[use value]] as a physical commodity. It derives its value by being declared by a government to be [[legal tender]]; that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for "all debts, public and private".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Etymology of Money |url=http://www.thewallstreetpsychologist.com/recent_posts/the-etymology-of-money/ |website=Thewallstreetpsychologist.com |accessdate=24 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403151319/http://www.thewallstreetpsychologist.com/recent_posts/the-etymology-of-money/ |archivedate=3 April 2015 |df=}} &lt;/ref&gt; [[Counterfeit money]] can cause [[good money]] to lose its value.

The [[money supply]] of a country consists of currency (banknotes and coins) and, depending on the particular definition used, one or more types of [[bank money]] (the balances held in [[transactional account|checking accounts]], [[savings account]]s, and other types of [[bank accounts]]). Bank money, which consists only of records (mostly computerized in modern banking), forms by far the largest part of [[broad money]] in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Boyle |first1=David |authorlink1=David Boyle (author) |title=The Little Money Book |publisher=The Disinformation Company |year=2006 |page=37 |isbn=978-1-932857-26-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Money |url=http://zzaponline.com/history-of-money/ |website=Zzaponline.com |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Peter, ''A Primer on Money and Banking, and Gold'', Wiley, 2008 edition, pp. 29–39&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word "money" is believed to originate from a temple of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], on [[Capitoline]], one of Rome's seven hills.  In the ancient world Juno was often associated with money. The temple of [[Juno Moneta]] at Rome was the place where the mint of Ancient Rome was located.&lt;ref&gt;D'Eprio, Peter &amp; Pinkowish, Mary Desmond (1998). ''What Are the Seven Wonders of the World?'' First Anchor Books, p. 192. {{ISBN|0-385-49062-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Juno" may derive from the Etruscan goddess [[Uni (mythology)|Uni]] (which means "the one", "unique", "unit", "union", "united") and "Moneta" either from the Latin word "monere" (remind, warn, or instruct) or the Greek word "moneres" (alone, unique).

In the Western world, a prevalent term for coin-money has been ''[[wikt:specie|specie]]'', stemming from Latin ''in specie'', meaning 'in kind'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=specie&amp;searchmode=phrase |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=etymonline.com |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of money}}
[[File:BMC 06.jpg|thumb|left|A 640 BC one-third [[stater]] [[electrum]] coin from [[Lydia#First coinage|Lydia]]]]

The use of [[barter]]-like methods may date back to at least 100,000 years ago, though there is no evidence of a society or economy that relied primarily on barter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcel Mauss|Mauss, Marcel]]. ''The Gift: The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies''. pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, non-monetary societies operated largely along the principles of [[gift economy]] and [[debt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/08/what-is-debt-%E2%80%93-an-interview-with-economic-anthropologist-david-graeber.html |title=What is Debt? – An Interview with Economic Anthropologist David Graeber |publisher=[[Naked Capitalism]]|date=2011-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Graeber: ''Debt: The First 5000 Years'', Melville 2011. Cf. [http://socialtextjournal.org/a-history-of-debt/ review]&lt;/ref&gt; When barter did in fact occur, it was usually between either complete strangers or potential enemies.&lt;ref name="Graeber, David pp. 153-154"&gt;{{cite book |author=David Graeber |title=Toward an anthropological theory of value: the false coin of our own dreams |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uo8tttilAlQC&amp;pg=PA153 |accessdate=10 February 2011 |year=2001 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-0-312-24045-5 |pages=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cultures around the world eventually developed the use of [[commodity money]]. The Mesopotamian [[shekel]] was a unit of weight, and relied on the mass of something like 160 [[Grain (unit)|grains]] of [[barley]].&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, ''History Begins at Sumer'', pp. 52–55.&lt;/ref&gt; The first usage of the term came from [[Mesopotamia]] circa 3000 BC.  Societies in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia used [[shell money]] – often, the shells of the [[cowry]] (''Cypraea moneta L.'' or ''C. annulus L.''). According to [[Herodotus]], the [[Lydians]] were the first people to introduce the use of [[gold coin|gold]] and [[silver coin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus. ''Histories'', I, 94&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought by modern scholars that these first stamped [[coins]] were minted around 650–600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rg.ancients.info/lion/article.html |author=Goldsborough, Reid |title=World's First Coin |publisher=rg.ancients.info |date=2003-10-02 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jiao zi.jpg|thumb|upright|Song Dynasty ''Jiaozi'', the world's earliest paper money]]

The system of [[commodity money]] eventually evolved into a system of [[representative money]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} This occurred because gold and silver merchants or banks would issue receipts to their depositors – redeemable for the [[commodity money]] deposited. Eventually, these receipts became generally accepted as a means of payment and were used as money. Paper money or [[banknotes]] were first used in China during the [[Song dynasty]]. These banknotes, known as "[[Jiaozi (currency)|jiaozi]]", evolved from [[promissory notes]] that had been used since the 7th century. However, they did not displace commodity money, and were used alongside coins. In the 13th century, paper money became known in Europe through the accounts of travelers, such as [[Marco Polo]] and [[William of Rubruck]]&lt;!-- Giljom de Rubruk --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moshenskyi |first=Sergii |title=History of the weksel: Bill of exchange and promissory note |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4363-0694-2 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marco Polo's account of paper money during the [[Yuan dynasty]] is the subject of a chapter of his book, ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]'', titled "[[s:The Travels of Marco Polo/Book 2/Chapter 24|How the Great Kaan Causeth the Bark of Trees, Made Into Something Like Paper, to Pass for Money All Over his Country]]."&lt;ref name="Marco Polo"&gt;{{cite book |author=Marco Polo |title=The Travels of Marco Polo, a Venetian, in the Thirteenth Century: Being a Description, by that Early Traveller, of Remarkable Places and Things, in the Eastern Parts of the World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JetQAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA353 |accessdate=19 September 2012 |year=1818 |pages=353–355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banknotes were first issued in Europe by [[Stockholms Banco]] in 1661, and were again also used alongside coins. The [[gold standard]], a [[monetary system]] where the medium of exchange are paper notes that are convertible into pre-set, fixed quantities of gold, replaced the use of gold coins as currency in the 17th–19th centuries in Europe. These gold standard notes were made [[legal tender]], and redemption into gold coins was discouraged. By the beginning of the 20th century almost all countries had adopted the gold standard, backing their legal tender notes with fixed amounts of gold.

After [[World War II]] and the [[Bretton Woods Conference]], most countries adopted fiat currencies that were fixed to the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]]. The U.S. dollar was in turn fixed to gold. In 1971 the U.S. government suspended the convertibility of the U.S. dollar to gold. After this many countries de-pegged their currencies from the U.S. dollar, and most of the world's currencies became unbacked by anything except the governments' fiat of legal tender and the ability to convert the money into goods via payment. According to proponents of [[Modern Money Theory|modern money theory]], fiat money is also backed by taxes. By imposing taxes, states create demand for the currency they issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wray |first1=L.

== Functions ==
{{also|monetary economics}}
{{Economics sidebar}}
In ''Money and the Mechanism of Exchange (1875)'', [[William Stanley Jevons]] famously analyzed money in terms of four functions: a ''[[medium of exchange]]'', a ''common measure of value'' (or [[unit of account]]), a ''standard of value'' (or [[standard of deferred payment]]), and a ''[[store of value]]''. By 1919, Jevons's four functions of money were summarized in the [[couplet]]:
:Money's a matter of functions four,
:A Medium, a Measure, a Standard, a Store.&lt;ref name="a_milnes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Milnes |first=Alfred |title=The economic foundations of reconstruction |publisher=Macdonald and Evans |year=1919 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This couplet would later become widely popular in macroeconomics textbooks.&lt;ref name="dwivedi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dwivedi |first=DN |title=Macroeconomics: Theory and Policy |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill |year=2005 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most modern textbooks now list only three functions, that of [[medium of exchange]], [[unit of account]], and [[store of value]], not considering a standard of deferred payment as a distinguished function, but rather subsuming it in the others.&lt;ref name="mankiw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="krugman"&gt;Krugman, Paul &amp; Wells, Robin, ''Economics'', Worth Publishers, New York (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abel_bernanke"&gt;{{cite book |last=Abel |first=Andrew |last2=Bernanke |first2=Ben |authorlink2=Ben Bernanke |title=Macroeconomics |publisher=Pearson |year=2005 |edition=5th |pages=266–269 |chapter=7 |isbn=978-0-201-32789-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many historical disputes regarding the combination of money's functions, some arguing that they need more separation and that a single unit is insufficient to deal with them all. One of these arguments is that the role of money as a [[medium of exchange]] is in conflict with its role as a [[store of value]]: its role as a store of value requires holding it without spending, whereas its role as a medium of exchange requires it to circulate.&lt;ref name="greco" /&gt;  Others argue that storing of value is just deferral of the exchange, but does not diminish the fact that money is a medium of exchange that can be transported both across space and time. The term "financial capital" is a more general and inclusive term for all liquid instruments, whether or not they are a uniformly recognized tender.

=== Medium of exchange ===
{{Main|Medium of exchange}}

When money is used to intermediate the exchange of goods and services, it is performing a function as a ''medium of exchange''. It thereby avoids the inefficiencies of a barter system, such as the "[[coincidence of wants]]" problem.  Money's most important usage is as a method for comparing the values of dissimilar objects.

=== Measure of value ===
{{Main|Unit of account}}

A ''unit of account'' (in economics)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.boundless.com/business/textbooks/boundless-business-textbook/the-functions-of-money-and-banking-21/money-as-a-tool-123/functions-of-money-568-3194/ |title=Functions of Money |website=[[Boundless (company)|boundless.com]]|date=2017-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a standard numerical monetary unit of measurement of the market value of goods, services, and other transactions. Also known as a "measure" or "standard" of relative worth and deferred payment, a unit of account is a necessary prerequisite for the formulation of commercial agreements that involve debt.

Money acts as a standard measure and common denomination of trade. It is thus a basis for quoting and bargaining of prices. It is necessary for developing efficient accounting systems.

=== Standard of deferred payment ===
{{Main|Standard of deferred payment}}
While ''standard of deferred payment'' is distinguished by some texts,&lt;ref name="greco" /&gt; particularly older ones, other texts subsume this under other functions.&lt;ref name="mankiw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="krugman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abel_bernanke"/&gt; A "standard of deferred payment" is an accepted way to settle a [[debt]] – a unit in which debts are denominated, and the status of money as [[legal tender]], in those jurisdictions which have this concept, states that it may function for the discharge of debts. When debts are denominated in money, the real value of debts may change due to inflation and [[deflation]], and for sovereign and international debts via [[debasement]] and [[devaluation]].

=== Store of value ===
{{Main|Store of value}}
To act as a ''store of value'', a money must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved – and be predictably usable as a medium of exchange when it is retrieved. The value of the money must also remain stable over time. Some have argued that inflation, by reducing the value of money, diminishes the ability of the money to function as a store of value.&lt;ref name="mankiw"/&gt;

==Properties==
To fulfill its various functions, money must have certain properties:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Desjardins |first1=Jeff |title=Infographic: The Properties of Money |url=http://money.visualcapitalist.com/infographic-the-properties-of-money/ |publisher=The Money Project |accessdate=18 July 2017 |date=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fungibility]]: its individual units must be capable of mutual substitution (i.e., interchangeability).
* [[Durability]]: able to withstand repeated use.
* Portability: easily carried and transported.
* Cognizability: its value must be easily identified.
* Stability of value: its value should not fluctuate.

== Money supply ==
{{Main|Money supply}}
[[File:MB, M1 and M2 aggregates from 1981 to 2012.png|upright=1.5|thumb|right|Money Base, M1 and M2 in the U.S. from 1981 to 2012]]
[[File:RIAN archive 978776 Printing paper money at Goznak factory in Perm.jpg|thumb|right|Printing paper money at a printing press in [[Perm]]]]
In economics, money is a broad term that refers to any [[Instrument (finance)|financial instrument]] that can fulfil the functions of money (detailed above). These financial instruments together are collectively referred to as the [[money supply]] of an economy. In other words, the money supply is the number of financial instruments within a specific economy available for purchasing goods or services. Since the money supply consists of various financial instruments (usually currency, demand deposits and various other types of deposits), the amount of money in an economy is measured by adding together these financial instruments creating a ''monetary aggregate''.

[[Modern monetary theory]] distinguishes among different ways to measure the stock of money or money supply, reflected in different types of monetary aggregates, using a categorization system that focuses on the [[Market liquidity|liquidity]] of the financial instrument used as money. The most commonly used monetary aggregates (or types of money) are conventionally designated M1, M2 and M3. These are successively larger aggregate categories: M1 is currency (coins and bills) plus [[demand deposit]]s (such as checking accounts); M2 is M1 plus [[savings account]]s and [[time deposit]]s under $100,000; and M3 is M2 plus larger time deposits and similar institutional accounts. M1 includes only the most liquid financial instruments, and M3 relatively illiquid instruments. The precise definition of M1, M2 etc. may be different in different countries.

Another measure of money, M0, is also used; unlike the other measures, it does not represent actual [[purchasing power]] by firms and households in the economy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} M0 is [[base money]], or the amount of money actually issued by the [[central bank]] of a country. It is measured as currency plus deposits of banks and other institutions at the central bank. M0 is also the only money that can satisfy the [[reserve requirements]] of [[commercial banks]].

=== Creation of money ===
In current economic systems, money is created by two procedures:

'''Legal tender''', or '''narrow money''' (M0) is the cash money created by a Central Bank by minting coins and printing banknotes.

'''Bank money''', or '''broad money''' (M1/M2) is the money created by private banks through the recording of loans as deposits of borrowing clients, with partial support indicated by the cash ratio. Currently, bank money is created as electronic money.

In most countries, the majority of money is mostly created as M1/M2 by commercial banks making loans. Contrary to some popular misconceptions, banks do not act simply as intermediaries, lending out deposits that savers place with them, and do not depend on central bank money (M0) to create new loans and deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/quarterly-bulletin/2014/q1/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy|title=Money creation in the modern economy {{!}} Bank of England|website=www.bankofengland.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Market liquidity ===
{{Main|Market liquidity}}
"Market liquidity" describes how easily an item can be traded for another item, or into the common currency within an economy. Money is the most liquid asset because it is universally recognised and accepted as the common currency. In this way, money gives consumers the [[liberty|freedom]] to trade goods and services easily without having to barter.

Liquid financial instruments are easily [[tradable]] and have low [[transaction cost]]s. There should be no (or minimal) [[Bid/offer spread|spread]] between the prices to buy and sell the instrument being used as money.

== Types ==
Currently, most modern monetary systems are based on fiat money. However, for most of history, almost all money was commodity money, such as gold and silver coins. As economies developed, commodity money was eventually replaced by [[representative money]], such as the [[gold standard]], as traders found the physical transportation of gold and silver burdensome. Fiat currencies gradually took over in the last hundred years, especially since the breakup of the [[Bretton Woods system]] in the early 1970s.

=== Commodity ===
{{Main|Commodity money}}
[[File:1914 Sydney Half Sovereign - St. George.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1914 British [[Sovereign (British coin)|gold sovereign]]]]
Many items have been used as [[commodity money]] such as naturally scarce [[precious metal]]s, [[conch shell]]s, [[barley]], beads etc., as well as many other things that are thought of as having [[Intrinsic theory of value|value]]. Commodity money value comes from the commodity out of which it is made. The commodity itself constitutes the money, and the money is the commodity.&lt;ref name="Mises"&gt;Mises, Ludwig von. ''[[The Theory of Money and Credit]]'', (Indianapolis, IN: [[Liberty Fund, Inc.]], 1981), trans. H. E. Batson. Ch.3 Part One: The Nature of Money, Chapter 3: The Various Kinds of Money, Section 3: Commodity Money, Credit Money, and Fiat Money, Paragraph 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of commodities that have been used as mediums of exchange include gold, silver, copper, rice, [[Wampum]], salt, peppercorns, large stones, decorated belts, shells, alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis, candy, etc. These items were sometimes used in a metric of perceived value in conjunction to one another, in various commodity valuation or [[price system]] economies. Use of commodity money is similar to barter, but a commodity money provides a simple and automatic [[unit of account]] for the commodity which is being used as money. Although some [[gold coins]] such as the [[Krugerrand]] are considered [[legal tender]], there is no record of their face value on either side of the coin. The rationale for this is that emphasis is laid on their direct link to the prevailing value of their [[Millesimal fineness|fine gold]] content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randrefinery.com/products_krugerrands.htm randRefinery.com]. Retrieved July-18-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Representative ===
{{Main|Representative money}}
In 1875, the British economist [[William Stanley Jevons]] described the money used at the time as "[[representative money]]". Representative money is money that consists of [[token coin]]s, [[paper money]] or other physical tokens such as certificates, that can be reliably exchanged for a fixed quantity of a commodity such as gold or silver. The value of representative money stands in direct and fixed relation to the commodity that backs it, while not itself being composed of that commodity.&lt;ref name="Jevons"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jevons |first=William Stanley |title=Money and the Mechanism of Exchange |year=1875 |chapter=XVI: Representative Money |chapter-url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=318&amp;chapter=9990&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |accessdate=2009-06-28 |isbn=978-1-59605-260-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fiat ===
{{Main|Fiat money}}
[[File:2006 AEGold Proof Rev.png|thumb|upright|Gold coins are an example of legal tender that are traded for their intrinsic value, rather than their face value.]]
Fiat money or fiat currency is money whose value is not derived from any intrinsic value or guarantee that it can be converted into a valuable commodity (such as gold). Instead, it has value only by government order (fiat). Usually, the government declares the fiat currency (typically notes and coins from a central bank, such as the [[Federal Reserve System]] in the U.S.) to be [[legal tender]], making it unlawful not to accept the fiat currency as a means of repayment for all debts, public and private.&lt;ref name="www-personal.umich"&gt;{{cite web |author=Deardorff, Prof. Alan V. |year=2008 |title=Deardorff's Glossary of International Economics |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/f.html |publisher=Department of Economics, University of Michigan |accessdate=2008-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BlackHenry"&gt;Black, Henry Campbell (1910). ''A Law Dictionary Containing Definitions Of The Terms And Phrases Of American And English Jurisprudence, Ancient And Modern'', p. 494. West Publishing Co. [[Black’s Law Dictionary]] defines the word "fiat" to mean "a short order or warrant of a Judge or magistrate directing some act to be done; an authority issuing from some competent source for the doing of some legal act"&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[bullion coins]] such as the [[Australian Gold Nugget]] and [[American Gold Eagle|American Eagle]] are legal tender, however, they trade based on the [[market price]] of the metal content as a [[commodity]], rather than their legal tender [[face value]] (which is usually only a small fraction of their bullion value).&lt;ref name="usmint.gov"&gt;[http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/american_eagles/index.cfm?flash=no&amp;action=American_Eagle_Gold usmiNT.gov].

Fiat money, if physically represented in the form of currency (paper or coins) can be accidentally damaged or destroyed. However, fiat money has an advantage over representative or commodity money, in that the same laws that created the money can also define rules for its replacement in case of damage or destruction. For example, the U.S. government will replace mutilated [[Federal Reserve Note]]s (U.S. fiat money) if at least half of the physical note can be reconstructed, or if it can be otherwise proven to have been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091018013943/http://www.bep.treas.gov/section.cfm/8/39 Shredded &amp; Mutilated: Mutilated Currency], ''Bureau of Engraving and Printing''. Retrieved 2007-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, commodity money which has been lost or destroyed cannot be recovered.

=== Coinage ===
{{main|Coin}}
These factors led to the shift of the store of value being the metal itself: at first silver, then both silver and gold, and at one point there was bronze as well. Now we have copper coins and other non-precious metals as coins. Metals were mined, weighed, and stamped into coins. This was to assure the individual taking the coin that he was getting a certain known weight of precious metal. Coins could be counterfeited, but they also created a new [[unit of account]], which helped lead to banking. [[Archimedes' principle]] provided the next link: coins could now be easily tested for their [[Fineness|fine]] weight of metal, and thus the value of a coin could be determined, even if it had been shaved, debased or otherwise tampered with (see [[Numismatics]]).

In most major economies using coinage, copper, silver and gold formed three tiers of coins. Gold coins were used for large purchases, payment of the military and backing of state activities. Silver coins were used for midsized transactions, and as a unit of account for taxes, dues, contracts and fealty, while copper coins represented the coinage of common transaction. This system had been used in ancient [[Indian coinage|India]] since the time of the [[Mahajanapadas]]. In Europe, this system worked through the [[medieval]] period because there was virtually no new gold, silver or copper introduced through mining or conquest.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Thus the overall ratios of the three coinages remained roughly equivalent.

=== Paper ===
{{main|Banknote}}
[[File:Hui zi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Huizi (currency)|Huizi currency]], issued in 1160]]
In [[History of China|premodern]] China, the need for credit and for circulating a medium that was less of a burden than exchanging thousands of copper coins led to the introduction of [[banknote|paper money]], commonly known today as [[banknote]]s. This economic phenomenon was a slow and gradual process that took place from the late [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) into the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279). It began as a means for merchants to exchange heavy coinage for [[receipt]]s of deposit issued as [[promissory note]]s from shops of wholesalers, notes that were valid for temporary use in a small regional territory. In the 10th century, the [[Song dynasty]] government began circulating these notes amongst the traders in their [[monopoly|monopolized]] salt industry. The Song government granted several shops the sole right to issue banknotes, and in the early 12th century the government finally took over these shops to produce state-issued currency. Yet the banknotes issued were still regionally valid and temporary; it was not until the mid 13th century that a standard and uniform government issue of paper money was made into an acceptable nationwide currency. The already widespread methods of [[woodblock printing]] and then [[Pi Sheng]]'s [[movable type]] printing by the 11th century was the impetus for the massive production of paper money in premodern China.
[[File:Money poster.JPG|thumb|left|Paper money from different countries]]
At around the same time in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], a vigorous [[monetary economy]] was created during the 7th–12th centuries on the basis of the expanding levels of circulation of a stable high-value currency (the [[dinar]]).

In Europe, paper money was first introduced in [[Sweden]] in 1661. Sweden was rich in copper, thus, because of copper's low value, extraordinarily big coins (often weighing several kilograms) had to be made. The advantages of paper currency were numerous: it reduced transport of gold and silver, and thus lowered the risks; it made loaning gold or silver at interest easier, since the specie (gold or silver) never left the possession of the lender until someone else redeemed the note; and it allowed for a division of currency into credit and specie backed forms. It enabled the sale of [[stock]] in [[joint stock company|joint stock companies]], and the redemption of those [[shares]] in paper.

However, these advantages held within them disadvantages. First, since a note has no intrinsic value, there was nothing to stop issuing authorities from printing more of it than they had specie to back it with. Second, because it increased the money supply, it increased inflationary pressures, a fact observed by [[David Hume]] in the 18th century. The result is that paper money would often lead to an inflationary bubble, which could collapse if people began demanding hard money, causing the demand for paper notes to fall to zero. The printing of paper money was also associated with wars, and financing of wars, and therefore regarded as part of maintaining a [[standing army]]. For these reasons, paper currency was held in suspicion and hostility in Europe and America. It was also addictive, since the speculative profits of trade and capital creation were quite large. Major nations established [[mint (coin)|mints]] to print money and mint coins, and branches of their treasury to collect taxes and hold gold and silver stock.

At this time both silver and gold were considered [[legal tender]], and accepted by governments for taxes. However, the [[Gresham's law|instability in the ratio]] between the two grew over the course of the 19th century, with the increase both in supply of these metals, particularly silver, and of trade. This is called [[bimetallism]] and the attempt to create a [[Bimetallism|bimetallic]] standard where both gold and silver backed currency remained in circulation occupied the efforts of inflationists. Governments at this point could use currency as an instrument of policy, printing paper currency such as the United States [[United States Note|Greenback]], to pay for military expenditures. They could also set the terms at which they would redeem notes for specie, by limiting the amount of purchase, or the minimum amount that could be redeemed.

[[File:Billets de 5000.jpg|thumb|upright|Banknotes with a face value of 5000 of different currencies]]
By 1900, most of the industrializing nations were on some form of gold standard, with paper notes and silver coins constituting the circulating medium. Private banks and governments across the world followed [[Gresham's Law]]: keeping gold and silver paid, but paying out in notes. This did not happen all around the world at the same time, but occurred sporadically, generally in times of war or financial crisis, beginning in the early part of the 20th century and continuing across the world until the late 20th century, when the regime of floating fiat currencies came into force. One of the last countries to break away from the [[gold standard]] was the United States in 1971.

No country anywhere in the world today has an enforceable [[gold standard]] or [[silver standard]] currency system.

=== Commercial bank ===
{{Main|Demand deposit}}
[[File:Sweet success.jpg|thumb|right|A check, used as a means of converting funds in a [[demand deposit]] to cash]]
Commercial bank money or [[demand deposit]]s are claims against financial institutions that can be used for the purchase of goods and services. A demand deposit account is an account from which funds can be withdrawn at any time by check or [[cash]] withdrawal without giving the bank or financial institution any prior notice. Banks have the legal obligation to return funds held in demand deposits immediately upon demand (or 'at call'). Demand deposit withdrawals can be performed in person, via checks or bank drafts, using [[automatic teller machine]]s (ATMs), or through [[online banking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Sullivan |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |first2=Steven M. |last2=Sheffrin |authorlink2=Steven M.

Commercial bank money is created through [[fractional-reserve banking]], the banking practice where banks keep only a ''fraction'' of their [[demand deposit|deposits]] in [[bank reserves|reserve]] (as cash and other highly liquid assets) and lend out the remainder, while maintaining the simultaneous obligation to redeem all these deposits upon demand.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bank Credit Analysis Handbook: A Guide for Analysts, Bankers and Investors'' by Jonathan Golin.

The process of fractional-reserve banking has a cumulative effect of [[money creation]] by commercial banks, as it expands [[money supply]] (cash and demand deposits) beyond what it would otherwise be.  Because of the prevalence of fractional reserve banking, the [[M2 (economics)|broad money supply]] of most countries is a multiple larger than the amount of [[Monetary base|base money]] created by the country's [[central bank]]. That multiple (called the [[money multiplier]]) is determined by the [[reserve requirement]] or other [[financial ratio]] requirements imposed by financial regulators.

The money supply of a country is usually held to be the total amount of currency in circulation plus the total value of checking and savings deposits in the commercial banks in the country. In modern economies, relatively little of the money supply is in physical currency. For example, in December 2010 in the U.S., of the $8853.4 billion in broad money supply (M2), only $915.7 billion (about 10%) consisted of physical coins and paper money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/20110127/|title=FRB: H.6 Release – Money Stock and Debt Measures|date=January 27, 2011|website=www.federalreserve.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital or electronic===
{{Main|Digital money}}
The development of computer technology in the second part of the twentieth century allowed money to be represented digitally. By 1990, in the United States all money transferred between its central bank and commercial banks was in electronic form.  By the 2000s most money existed as [[digital currency]] in banks databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://money.howstuffworks.com/currency6.htm|title=How Currency Works|date=2 September 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, by number of transaction, 20 to 58 percent of transactions were electronic (dependant on country).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150724-the-truth-about-the-death-of-cash|title=The truth about the death of cash|first=Rose|last=Eveleth|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-national digital currencies where developed in the early 2000s. In particular [[Flooz]] and [[Beenz]], had gained momentum before the [[Dot-com bubble]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Not much innovation occurred until the conception of [[Bitcoin]] in 2009, which introduced the concept of a [[cryptocurrency]] – a decentralised trustless currency.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

== Monetary policy ==
{{Main|Monetary policy}}
[[File:USCurrency Federal Reserve.jpg|210px|thumbnail|US dollar banknotes]]
When gold and silver are used as money, the money supply can grow only if the supply of these metals is increased by mining. This rate of increase will accelerate during periods of [[gold rush]]es and discoveries, such as when Columbus discovered the [[New World]] and brought back gold and silver to Spain, or when gold was [[California Gold Rush|discovered in California in 1848]]. This causes inflation, as the value of gold goes down. However, if the rate of [[gold mining]] cannot keep up with the growth of the economy, gold becomes relatively more valuable, and prices (denominated in gold) will drop, causing deflation. Deflation was the more typical situation for over a century when gold and paper money backed by gold were used as money in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Modern day monetary systems are based on fiat money and are no longer tied to the value of gold. The control of the amount of money in the economy is known as monetary policy. Monetary policy is the process by which a government, central bank, or [[monetary authority]] manages the [[money supply]] to achieve specific goals. Usually the goal of monetary policy is to accommodate economic growth in an environment of stable prices. For example, it is clearly stated in the [[Federal Reserve Act]] that the [[Board of Governors]] and the [[Federal Open Market Committee]] should seek "to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."&lt;ref&gt;The Federal Reserve. [http://www.federalreserve.gov/pf/pdf/pf_2.pdf 'Monetary Policy and the Economy".] ([[PDF]]) ''Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System'', (2005-07-05). Retrieved 2007-05-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

A failed monetary policy can have significant detrimental effects on an economy and the society that depends on it. These include [[hyperinflation]], [[stagflation]], [[recession]], high unemployment, shortages of imported goods, inability to export goods, and even total monetary collapse and the adoption of a much less efficient barter economy. This happened in Russia, for instance, after the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|fall of the Soviet Union]].

Governments and central banks have taken both regulatory and [[free market]] approaches to monetary policy. Some of the tools used to control the money supply include:
* changing the [[interest rate]] at which the central bank loans money to (or borrows money from) the commercial banks
* currency purchases or sales
* increasing or lowering [[Government debt|government borrowing]]
* increasing or lowering [[government spending]]
* manipulation of [[exchange rate]]s
* raising or lowering bank reserve requirements
* regulation or prohibition of [[Private currency|private currencies]]
* taxation or tax breaks on imports or exports of capital into a country

In the US, the [[Federal Reserve]] is responsible for controlling the money supply, while in the [[Euro area]] the respective institution is the [[European Central Bank]]. Other central banks with significant impact on global finances are the [[Bank of Japan]], [[People's Bank of China]] and the [[Bank of England]].

For many years much of monetary policy was influenced by an [[Economics|economic theory]] known as monetarism. [[Monetarism]] is an economic theory which argues that management of the money supply should be the primary means of regulating economic activity. The stability of the demand for money prior to the 1980s was a key finding of [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna Schwartz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Milton Friedman |author2=Anna Jacobson Schwartz |title=Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |location=Princeton, N.J |year=1971 |pages= |isbn=978-0-691-00354-2 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; supported by the work of [[David Laidler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=David Laidler |title=Money and Macroeconomics: The Selected Essays of David Laidler (Economists of the Twentieth Century) |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |location= |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=978-1-85898-596-1 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others. The nature of the demand for money changed during the 1980s owing to technical, institutional, and legal factors{{Clarify|date=September 2011}} and the influence of monetarism has since decreased.

== Counterfeit ==
{{Main|Counterfeit money}}
Counterfeit money is imitation currency produced without the legal sanction of the state or government. Producing or using counterfeit money is a form of fraud or forgery. Counterfeiting is almost as old as money itself. Plated copies (known as [[Fourrée]]s) have been found of [[Lydia#First coinage|Lydian coins]] which are thought to be among the first western coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Case for the World's Oldest Coin |url=http://rg.ancients.info/lion/article.html |accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the introduction of [[Banknotes|paper money]], the most prevalent method of counterfeiting involved mixing base metals with pure gold or silver. A form of counterfeiting is the production of documents by legitimate printers in response to fraudulent instructions. During [[World War II]], the [[Nazis]] forged British pounds and American dollars. Today some of the finest counterfeit banknotes are called ''[[Superdollar]]s'' because of their high quality and likeness to the real U.S. dollar. There has been significant counterfeiting of [[Euro]] banknotes and coins since the launch of the currency in 2002, but considerably less than for the U.S. dollar.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itsamoneything.com/money/counterfeiting-cash-money-infographic/#.VB71g5R_uJQ |title=Counterfeiting statistics for several currencies |publisher=Itsamoneything.com |accessdate=2014-09-21|date=2012-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Laundering ==
{{Main|Money laundering}}
Money laundering is the process in which the proceeds of crime are transformed into ostensibly legitimate money or other assets.&lt;ref name="Duhaimes"&gt;{{cite web |last=Duhaime, Christine. |title=What is Money Laundering? Duhaime's Financial Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Law |url=http://www.antimoneylaunderinglaw.com/aml-law-in-canada/what-is-money-laundering |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a number of legal and regulatory systems the term money laundering has become [[Conflation|conflated]] with other forms of financial crime, and sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system (involving things such as securities, [[digital currency|digital currencies]], credit cards, and traditional currency), including [[terrorism financing]], [[tax evasion]], and evading of [[international sanctions]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3710">{{For|the observation regarding integrated circuits|Moore's law}}
{{Refimprove|date=September 2011}}

'''Mooers's law''' is an empirical observation of behavior made by American [[computer scientist]] [[Calvin Mooers]] in 1959. The observation is made in relation to [[information retrieval]] and the interpretation of the observation is used commonly throughout the information profession both within and outside its original context.

{{quote|An information retrieval system will tend not to be used whenever it is more painful and troublesome for a customer to have information than for him not to have it.|[[Calvin Mooers]]&lt;ref name="morville"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xJNLJXXbhusC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:9780596007652&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qvWhT5DfHITs2QX1rNzPCA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mooers'%20law&amp;f=false |title= Ambient findability |series= O'Reilly Series. Marketing/Technology &amp; Society |author= Peter Morville |edition= illustrated |publisher= O'Reilly Media |year= 2005 |page= 44|isbn= 978-0-596-00765-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Original interpretation==

Mooers argued that information is at risk of languishing unused due not only on the effort required to assimilate it but also to any fallout that could arise from the discovery of information that conflicts with the user's personal, academic or corporate interests. In interacting with new information, a user runs the risk of proving their work incorrect or even irrelevant. Instead, Mooers argued, users prefer to remain in a state of safety in which new arguments are ignored in an attempt to save potential embarrassment or reprisal from supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mooers|first=Calvin|title=Mooers Law, or Why some Retrieval Systems are Used and Others Are not|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3633/is_199610/ai_n8749122/|work=Business Library|accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Out-of-context interpretation==

The more commonly used interpretation of Mooers's law is considered to be a derivation of the [[principle of least effort]] first stated by [[George Kingsley Zipf]]. This interpretation focuses on the amount of effort that will be expended to use and understand a particular information retrieval system before the information seeker "gives up", and the law is often paraphrased to increase the focus on the retrieval system:

{{quote|The more difficult and time consuming it is for a customer to use an information system, the less likely it is that he will use that information system.|J. Michael Pemberton}}
{{quote|Mooers's Law tells us that information will be used in direct proportion to how easy it is to obtain.|Roger K. Summit&lt;ref name="morville"/&gt;}}

In this interpretation, "painful and troublesome" comes from ''using'' the retrieval system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3618">The '''moral high ground''', in ethical or political parlance, refers to the status of being respected for remaining moral, and adhering to and upholding a universally recognized standard of justice or goodness.
:"Parties seeking the moral high ground simply refuse to act in ways which are not viewed as legitimate and morally defensible."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/conflict/peace/treatment/moralhg.htm Moral High Ground] - International Online Training Program On Intractable Conflict - Conflict Research Consortium, University of Colorado, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Holding the moral high ground can be used to legitimize [[political movements]], notably [[nonviolent resistance]], especially in the face of violent opposition,&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Johnson, ''Gandhi's Experiment with Truth'' (2006) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used by [[civil disobedience]] movements around the world to garner sympathy and support from society.

Similarly, 21st century states may refrain from declaring war in order to retain the moral high ground – though the cynic will observe that [[realpolitik]] still leads to wars being ''fought'', only without declarations.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Dinstein, ''War, Aggression and Self-Defence'' (2005) p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
Economist and social critic [[Robert H. Frank]] challenged the idea that prosocial behavior was necessarily deleterious in business in his book ''What Price the Moral High Ground?''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/titles/7602.html What Price the Moral High Ground: Ethical Dilemmas in Competitive Environments] - Robert H. Frank, {{ISBN|0-691-00672-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He argued that socially responsible firms often reap unexpected benefits even in highly competitive environments, because their commitment to principle makes them more attractive as partners to do business with.&lt;ref&gt;A. Teniati, ''The Collaborative Enterprise'' (2010) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Everyday use==

In everyday use a person may take the perspective of the 'moral high ground' in order to produce a [[critique]] of something, or merely to win an argument. This perspective is sometimes associated to [[snobbery]] but may also be a legitimate way of taking up a stance.

Social sciences or philosophies are sometimes accused of taking the 'moral high ground' because they are often inherently interested in the project of human freedom and justice. The traditional project of education itself may be seen as defending a type of moral high ground from [[popular culture]], perhaps by using [[critical pedagogy]]: its proponents may themselves be accused (rightly or wrongly) of seeking a false and unjustified sense of superiority thereby.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, ''Tolkien'' (2001) p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminism==
Kate Fillion considered that in the wake of [[second-wave feminism]] "assumptions about female moral superiority pervade the public discourse", placing women as "comrades on the moral high ground, pitted against a common adversary who dwells in the shadowy depths far below".&lt;ref&gt;Kate Fillion, ''Lip Service'' (1997) p. 305 and p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Robert Lowell]] took the moral high ground, not once, but twice, with separate American presidents, in protesting US militarism.&lt;ref&gt;Seamus Heaney, '' Finders Keepers'' (2002) p. 205-10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Mandelson]] considered that [[Tony Blair]] was "good at taking the high ground and throwing himself off it".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Simon Jenkins, ''Thatcher and Sons'' (2007) p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8628">The '''Nakdi Report''', also known as the '''Nakdi Document''' ({{lang-he|מסמך נקדי}}, ''{{lang|he-Latn|Mismach Nakdi}}'' )  or as the '''Nakdi guidelines''' is the document that provides ethical guidelines for use in Israel's broadcasting industry. Published as the '''''Guidelines for Coverage of News and Current Affairs''''' in 1995, the doctrine was first introduced in 1972 by the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]]. It is named for its original author, [[Nakdimon Rogel]].&lt;ref name=jp&gt;{{cite news|first=Greer Fay|last=Cashman |title=Veteran journalist and broadcaster Nakdimon Rogel dies |url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=248645&amp;R=R101|work=[[Jerusalem Post]] |publisher= |date=2011-12-08 |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patterned after the [[BBC]]’s Editorial Guidelines (previously, the Producer Guidelines), the Document currently consists of 161 clauses and contains a comprehensive code of ethics and practice for journalists working within the IBA. It is also applied to journalists in private broadcasting, though it is not legally binding.&lt;ref&gt;[[Second Authority for Television and Radio]] uses a stripped-down, less detailed version of the code of conduct, which does indeed have the force of law.&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was drawn up in 1972, the document has been revised four times - in 1979, 1985, 1995 and 1998 - and expanded to four times its original size.&lt;ref name=Limor2002&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fairness and legal challenges==
It is one of the few national ethics codes to retain a version of the [[Fairness Doctrine]]. This is in addition to notions of impartiality drawn from similar European codes, which require the Authority itself to refrain from broadcasting editorials.&lt;ref&gt;According to Amit M. Schejter, the crucial clause is clause 22: "Beyond the word of the law the Authority has no voice, policy or point of view of its own. The Authority does not broadcast 'editorials'. The role of the Authority and its employees is to let different voices speak for themselves."&lt;/ref&gt; Fairness, however, goes beyond mere impartiality: in order to "ensure the public’s right to receive full and reliable information alongside balanced and
varied opinions", journalists are required to "solicit opposing opinion, fairly notify the public if comment was refused, and avoid becoming 'tools of response' for 'professional reaction teams.'"&lt;ref&gt;Rogel, Nakdimon and Schejer, Amit. ''The Nakdi Document: Guidelines for Covering News and Current Affairs'', Jerusalem: Israel Broadcasting Authority, 1998; Clauses 30-31.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirements to ensure varied opinion - repeated elsewhere in the document&lt;ref&gt;Rogel, Nakdimon and Schejer, Amit. ''The Nakdi Document: Guidelines for Covering News and Current Affairs'', Jerusalem: Israel Broadcasting Authority, 1998; Clause 24.&lt;/ref&gt; as an enjoinder "that the pool of commentators must be varied", has caused several notable lawsuits to be filed against the IBA. Three in the 1980s were particularly notable: the first was against the landmark 1981 television miniseries ''The Pillar of Fire''. Brought by a group of Israelis of [[Sephardic]] descent who felt that the dramatised history of [[Zionism]] unfairly minimised their communities' contribution to the movement, the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] indicated that in this case fairness was "irrelevant"; broadcast could not be censored, but "another aspect of the issue should be presented".&lt;ref name=Schejter1999&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, a decision by the IBA to ban interviews with any supporters of the [[Palestinian Liberation Organisation]] in the [[Israeli-occupied territories|West Bank and Gaza]] was struck down; this case was the making of the now-legendary [[civil rights]] lawyer Amnon Zichroni. And in 1984, Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]] submitted that a similar ban on broadcasting his political statements be struck down. In a much-studied ruling that recognised racist speech was also [[free speech|protected speech]], the [[Supreme Court of Israel|High Court of Justice]] attempted to curtail the ''Zichroni vs IBA'' somewhat: [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]] was permitted a "right of reply" if its positions were misrepresented, but it could not demand that its platform be broadcast, and nor could it demand the right of reply to criticism.&lt;ref name=Schejter1999/&gt;

==Recent concerns==
More recently, the guidelines have faced a sustained barrage of criticism. After the 1996 revision appeared, a study by Yitzhak Roeh, a media studies academic at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|HUJI]] called it an "anachronism" and "irrelevant"&lt;ref&gt;Roeh, Yitzhak. "The Nakdi Document: Guidelines for Covering News and Current Affairs: A Review'', [[Ha'aretz]], 28 July 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, right-wing groups have frequently used the Nakdi Document as a basis for documentation of what they see as [[media bias]]; the two most high-profile incidents have been litigation surrounding the broadcast of [[Avishai Raviv]]'s "swearing-in ceremony" with [[Eyal]] at [[Baruch Goldstein]]'s grave, and the campaign to get rid of [[Gabi Gazit]], whom they saw as serially breaking "the policies of public radio".&lt;ref&gt;Cashman, Greer. "[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1178431585287&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull The Gift of the Gab, sure, but no more Gabi]", [[Jerusalem Post]], 7 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although at least one study has concluded that rather than being responses to political stimuli, the various revisions of the Document have resulted in a "crystallization and implementation of normative ethical guidelines for Israeli public broadcasting",&lt;ref name=Limor2002/&gt; criticism that the Document contains at least some inherent bias continues to be leveled. Recently, concern that the language expected of the Israeli media was not sufficiently neutral included the complaint that the phrase "[[East Jerusalem]]" were prohibited by the guidelines.&lt;ref name="titleLRB � Yonatan Mendel: Diary"&gt;{{cite web

The word derives from the Latin verb ''narrare'', "to tell", which is derived from the adjective ''gnarus'', "knowing" or "skilled".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Traupman|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Webster|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative can be organized in a number of thematic or formal categories: [[non-fiction]] (such as definitively including [[creative non-fiction]], [[biography]], [[journalism]], [[transcript poetry]], and [[historiography]]); fictionalization of historical events (such as [[anecdote]], [[myth]], [[legend]], and [[historical fiction]]); and [[fiction]] proper (such as [[literature]] in [[prose]] and sometimes [[poetry]], such as [[short story|short stories]], [[novel]]s, and [[narrative poetry|narrative poems and song]]s, and imaginary narratives as portrayed in other textual forms, games, or live or recorded performances).

Narrative is found in all forms of human creativity, art, and entertainment, including [[public speaking|speech]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], [[music]] and [[song]], [[comics]], [[journalism]], [[film]], [[television]] and [[video]], [[video game]]s, [[radio program|radio]], [[game]]play, [[play (activity)|unstructured recreation]], and [[performance]] in general, as well as some [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[drawing]], [[photography]], and other [[visual arts]], as long as a [[sequence (disambiguation)|sequence]] of events is presented. Several art movements, such as [[modern art]], refuse the narrative in favor of the [[abstract art|abstract]] and conceptual.

[[Oral storytelling]] is the earliest method for sharing narratives.&lt;ref&gt;International Journal of Education and the Arts | [https://web.archive.org/web/20080630042438/http://www.ijea.org/v2n1/ The Power of Storytelling: How Oral Narrative Influences Children's Relationships in Classrooms]&lt;/ref&gt; During most people's childhoods, narratives are used to guide them on proper behavior, cultural history, formation of a communal identity, and values, as especially studied in [[anthropology]] today among traditional [[indigenous people]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, ''et al.'' 2002. Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian events within any given narrative&lt;/ref&gt;

Narratives may also be nested within other narratives, such as narratives told by an [[unreliable narrator]] (a [[character (arts)|character]]) typically found in [[noir fiction]] genre. An important part of [[narration]] is the [[narrative mode]], the set of methods used to communicate the narrative through a process narration (see also "Narrative Aesthetics" below).

Along with [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], [[argumentation]], and [[description]], narration, broadly defined, is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse. More narrowly defined, it is the [[fiction-writing mode]] in which the [[narrator]] communicates directly to the reader.

== Overview ==
A narrative is a telling of some true or fictitious event or connected sequence of events, recounted by a narrator to a narratee (although there may be more than one of each).  Narratives are to be distinguished from descriptions of qualities, states, or situations, and also from dramatic enactments of events (although a dramatic work may also include narrative speeches).  A narrative consists of a set of events (the story) recounted in a process of narration (or [[discourse]]), in which the events are selected and arranged in a particular order (the plot).  The category of narratives includes both the shortest accounts of events (for example, ''the cat sat on the mat'', or a brief news item) and the longest historical or biographical works, diaries, travelogues, and so forth, as well as novels, ballads, epics, short stories, and other fictional forms.  In the study of fiction, it is usual to divide novels and shorter stories into first-person narratives and third-person narratives.  As an adjective, "narrative" means "characterized by or relating to storytelling":  thus '''narrative technique''' is the method of telling stories, and '''narrative poetry''' is the class of poems (including ballads, epics, and verse romances) that tell stories, as distinct from dramatic and lyric poetry.  Some theorists of narratology have attempted to isolate the quality or set of properties that distinguishes narrative from non-narrative writings:  this is called '''narrativity'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human nature==
[[Owen Flanagan]] of Duke University, a leading consciousness researcher, writes, "Evidence strongly suggests that humans in all cultures come to cast their own identity in some sort of narrative form. We are inveterate storytellers."&lt;ref&gt;Owen Flanagan ''Consciousness Reconsidered'' 198&lt;/ref&gt; Stories are an important aspect of culture. Many works of art and most works of literature tell stories; indeed, most of the [[humanities]] involve stories.&lt;ref&gt;Humanities tell our stories | https://asunow.asu.edu/content/humanities-tell-our-stories-what-it-means-be-human&lt;/ref&gt;
Stories are of ancient origin, existing in [[ancient Egypt]]ian, [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]], [[Ancient China|Chinese]] and [[History of India|Indian]] cultures and their [[myths]]. Stories are also a ubiquitous component of human communication, used as [[parables]] and examples to illustrate points. [[Storytelling]] was probably one of the earliest forms of entertainment. As noted by Owen Flanagan, narrative may also refer to psychological processes in self-identity, memory and [[meaning-making]].

[[Semiotics]] begins with the individual building blocks of [[meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] called [[sign (semiotics)|signs]]; and [[semantics]], the way in which signs are combined into [[code (semiotics)|codes]] to transmit messages. This is part of a general [[communication]] system using both verbal and non-verbal elements, and creating a discourse with different
[[modality (semiotics)|modalities]] and forms.

In ''On Realism in Art'' [[Roman Jakobson]] argues that literature exists as a separate entity. He and many other semioticians prefer the view that all texts, whether spoken or written, are the same, except that some authors [[encode (semiotics)|encode]] their texts with distinctive ''literary'' qualities that distinguish them from other forms of discourse. Nevertheless, there is a clear trend to address literary narrative forms as separable from other forms. This is first seen in [[Russian Formalism]] through [[Victor Shklovsky]]'s analysis of the relationship between composition and style, and in the work of [[Vladimir Propp]], who analysed the [[plot (narrative)|plots]] used in traditional folk-tales and identified 31 distinct functional components.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Propp, ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p 25, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend (or these trends) continued in the work of the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague School]] and of French scholars such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Roland Barthes]]. It leads to a structural analysis of narrative and an increasingly influential body of modern work that raises important theoretical questions:
* What is ''text?''
* What is its role ([[culture]])?
* How is it manifested as art, cinema, theater, or literature?
* Why is narrative divided into different [[genre]]s, such as poetry, [[Wikipedian in Residence|short stories]], and novels?

== Literary theory ==
In literary theoretic approach, narrative is being narrowly defined as [[fiction-writing mode]] in which the narrator is communicating directly to the reader. Until the late 19th century, [[literary criticism]] as an academic exercise dealt solely with [[poetry]] (including [[epic poem]]s like the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Paradise Lost]],'' and poetic drama like [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]). Most [[poem]]s did not have a narrator distinct from the author.

But [[novel]]s, lending a number of voices to several characters in addition to narrator's, created a possibility of narrator's views differing significantly from the author's views. With the rise of the novel in the [[18th century in literature|18th century]], the concept of the narrator (as opposed to "author") made the question of narrator a prominent one for literary theory. It has been proposed that perspective and interpretive knowledge are the essential characteristics, while focalization and structure are lateral characteristics of the narrator.{{According to whom|date=September 2013}}

The role of literary theory in narrative has been disputed; with some interpretations like [[Tzvetan Todorov|Todorov's]] narrative model that views all narratives in a cyclical manner, and that each narrative is characterized by a three part structure that allows the narrative to progress. The beginning stage being an establishment of equilibrium--a state of non conflict, followed by a disruption to this state, caused by an external event, and lastly a restoration or a return to equilibrium--a conclusion that brings the narrative back to a similar space before the events of the narrative unfolded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Todorov|first=Tzvetan|last2=Weinstein|first2=Arnold|date=1969|title=Structural Analysis of Narrative|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1345003|journal=NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction|volume=3|issue=1|pages=70–76|doi=10.2307/1345003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critiques of literary theory in narrative challenge the very role of literariness in narrative, as well as the role of narrative in literature. Meaning, narratives and their associated aesthetics, emotions, and values have the ability to operate without the presence of literature and vice versa. According to Didier Costa, the structural model used by Todorov and others is unfairly biased towards a Western interpretation of narrative, and that a more comprehensive and transformative model must be created in order to properly analyze narrative discourse in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coste|first=Didier|date=2017-06-28|title=Narrative Theory and Aesthetics in Literature|url=http://oxfordre.com/literature/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.001.0001/acrefore-9780190201098-e-116|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Literature|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.013.116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Framing also plays a pivotal role in narrative structure; an analysis of the historical and cultural contexts present during the development of a narrative is needed in order to more accurately represent the role of narratology in societies that relied heavily on oral narratives.

==Types of narrators and their modes==
A writer's choice in the narrator is crucial for the way a work of fiction is perceived by the reader. There is a distinction between [[first-person narrative|first-person]] and [[third-person narrative]], which [[Gérard Genette]] refers to as intradiegetic and extradiegetic narrative, respectively. Intradiagetic narrators are of two types: a homodiegetic narrator participates as a character in the story. Such a narrator cannot know more about other characters than what their actions reveal. A heterodiegetic narrator, in contrast, describes the experiences of the characters that appear in the story in which he or she does not participate.

Most narrators present their story from one of the following perspectives (called [[narrative mode]]s): first-person, or third-person limited or omniscient. Generally, a [[First-person narrative|first-person narrator]] brings greater focus on the feelings, opinions, and perceptions of a particular character in a story, and on how the character views the world and the views of other characters. If the writer's intention is to get inside the world of a character, then it is a good choice, although a [[Third person limited|third-person limited narrator]] is an alternative that does not require the writer to reveal all that a first-person character would know. By contrast, a [[Third-person omniscient narrative|third-person omniscient narrator]] gives a panoramic view of the world of the story, looking into many characters and into the broader background of a story. A third-person omniscient narrator can be an animal or an object, or it can be a more abstract instance that does not refer to itself. For stories in which the context and the views of many characters are important, a third-person narrator is a better choice. However, a third-person narrator does not need to be an omnipresent guide, but instead may merely be the protagonist referring to himself in the third person (also known as third person limited narrator).

=== Multiple narrators ===
{{Main|Multiperspectivity}}
A writer may choose to let several narrators tell the story from different points of view. Then it is up to the reader to decide which narrator seems most reliable for each part of the story. It may refer to the style of the writer in which he/she expresses the paragraph written. See for instance the works of [[Louise Erdrich]]. [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'' is a prime example of the use of multiple narrators. Faulkner employs [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] to narrate the story from various perspectives.

In Indigenous American communities, narratives and storytelling are often told by a number of elders in the community. In this way, the stories are never static because they are shaped by the relationship between narrator and audience. Thus, each individual story may have countless variations. Narrators often incorporate minor changes in the story in order to tailor the story to different audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Piquemal, 2003. From Native North American Oral Traditions to Western Literacy: Storytelling in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of multiple narratives in a story is not simply a stylistic choice, but rather an interpretive one that offers insight into the development of a larger social identity and the impact that has on the overarching narrative, as explained by Lee Haring.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haring|first=Lee|date=2004-08-27|title=Framing in Oral Narrative|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/172275|journal=Marvels &amp; Tales|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=229–245|doi=10.1353/mat.2004.0035|issn=1536-1802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haring analyzes the use of framing in oral narratives, and how the usage of multiple perspectives provides the audience with a greater historical and cultural background of the narrative. She also argues that narratives (particularly myths and folktales) that implement multiple narrators deserves to be categorized as its own narrative genre, rather than simply a narrative device that is used solely to explain phenomena from different points of view.

Haring provides an example from the Arabic folktales of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|A Thousand and One Nights]]'' to illustrate how framing was used to loosely connect each story to the next, where each story was enclosed within the larger narrative. Additionally, Haring draws comparisons between ''Thousand and One Nights'' and the oral storytelling observed in parts of rural [[Ireland]], islands of the Southwest Indian Ocean, and African cultures such as [[Madagascar|Madagascar.]]&lt;blockquote&gt;"I'll tell you what I'll do," said the smith. "I'll fix your sword for you tomorrow, if you tell me a story while I'm doing it." The speaker was an Irish storyteller in 1935, framing one story in another (O'Sullivan 75, 264). The moment recalls the Thousand and One Nights , where the story of "The Envier and the Envied" is enclosed in the larger story told by the Second Kalandar (Burton 1 : 113-39), and many stories are enclosed in others."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Aesthetics approach==
Narrative is a highly aesthetic art. Thoughtfully composed stories have a number of aesthetic elements. Such elements include the idea of [[narrative structure]], with identifiable beginnings, middles and ends, or exposition-development-climax-denouement, with coherent plot lines; a strong focus on temporality including retention of the past, attention to present action and protention/future anticipation; a substantial focus on character and characterization, "arguably the most important single component of the novel" ([[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]] ''The Art of Fiction'' 67); different voices interacting, "the sound of the human voice, or many voices, speaking in a variety of accents, rhythms and registers" (Lodge ''The Art of Fiction'' 97; see also the theory of [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] for expansion of this idea); a narrator or narrator-like voice, which "addresses" and "interacts with" reading audiences (see [[Reader Response]] theory); communicates with a [[Wayne Booth]]-esque rhetorical thrust, a dialectic process of interpretation, which is at times beneath the surface, forming a plotted narrative, and at other times much more visible, "arguing" for and against various positions; relies substantially on the use of literary tropes (see [[Hayden White]], ''Metahistory'' for expansion of this idea); is often intertextual with other literatures; and commonly demonstrates an effort toward ''[[bildungsroman]]'', a description of identity development with an effort to evince ''becoming'' in character and community. {{technical statement|date=January 2013}}

== Psychological approach ==
{{see also|Narrative therapy}}
Within [[philosophy of mind]], the [[social sciences]] and various clinical fields including medicine, narrative can refer to aspects of human psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Hevern, V. W. (2004, March). [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~hevern/narpsych/nrintro.html Introduction and general overview. Narrative psychology: Internet and resource guide]. [[Le Moyne College]]. Retrieved September 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A personal narrative process is involved in a person's sense of [[Personal identity|personal]] or [[cultural identity]], and in the creation and construction of [[memories]]; it is thought by some to be the fundamental nature of the [[self]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, Daniel C (1992) [http://cogprints.org/266/ The Self as a Center of Narrative Gravity.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dan McAdams |title=Redemptive Self: Narrative Identity in America Today |journal=The Self and Memory |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=95–116 |year=2004 |doi= 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195176933.001.0001|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a729208757~db=all~jumptype=rss|isbn=9780195176933 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The breakdown of a coherent or positive narrative has been implicated in the development of [[psychosis]] and [[mental disorder]], and its repair said to play an important role in journeys of [[recovery model|recovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gold E |title=From narrative wreckage to islands of clarity: Stories of recovery from psychosis |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=53 |issue=8 |pages=1271–5 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17872833 |pmc=1949240 }} Hyden, L.-C. &amp; Brockmeier, J. (2009). Health, Illness and Culture: Broken Narratives. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Narrative Therapy]] is a school of (family) [[psychotherapy]].

[[Illness narrative]]s are a way for a person affected by an illness to make sense of his or her experiences.&lt;ref name=Sulik&gt;{{cite book
|author=Gayle A. Sulik

|oclc= 535493589 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They typically follow one of several set patterns: ''restitution'', ''chaos'', or ''quest'' narratives. In the [[restitution]] narrative, the person sees the illness as a temporary detour. The primary goal is to return permanently to normal life and normal health. These may also be called '''cure narratives'''. In the [[chaos narrative]], the person sees the illness as a permanent state that will inexorably get worse, with no redeeming virtues. This is typical of diseases like [[Alzheimer's disease]]: the patient gets worse and worse, and there is no hope of returning to normal life. The third major type, the [[quest narrative]], positions the illness experience as an opportunity to transform oneself into a better person through overcoming adversity and re-learning what is most important in life; the physical outcome of the illness is less important than the spiritual and psychological transformation. This is typical of the triumphant view of [[cancer survivorship]] in the [[breast cancer culture]].&lt;ref name=Sulik /&gt;

Personality traits, more specifically the [[Big Five personality traits]], appear to be associated with the type of language or patterns of word use found in an individual's self-narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsh, J. B., &amp; Peterson, J. B. (2009). Personality and language use in self-narratives. Journal of Research in Personality, 43, 524-527.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, language use in self-narratives accurately reflects human personality. The linguistic correlates of each Big Five trait are as follows:

* [[Extraversion]] - positively correlated with words referring to humans, social processes and family;
* [[Agreeableness]] - positively correlated with family, inclusiveness and certainty; negatively correlated with anger and body (i.e., few negative comments about health/body);
* [[Conscientiousness]] - positively correlated with achievement and work; negatively related to body, death, anger and exclusiveness;
* [[Neuroticism]] - positively correlated with sadness, negative emotion, body, anger, home and anxiety; negatively correlated with work;
* [[Openness]] - positively correlated with perceptual processes, hearing and exclusiveness

== Social sciences approaches==
Human beings often claim to understand events when they manage to formulate a coherent story or narrative explaining how they believe the event was generated. Narratives thus lie at foundations of our cognitive procedures and also provide an explanatory framework for the social sciences, particularly when it is difficult to assemble enough cases to permit statistical analysis. Narrative is often used in [[case study research]] in the social sciences. Here it has been found that the dense, contextual, and interpenetrating nature of social forces uncovered by detailed narratives is often more interesting and useful for both social theory and social policy than other forms of social inquiry.

Sociologists Jaber F. Gubrium and James A. Holstein have contributed to the formation of a constructionist approach to narrative in sociology. From their book The Self We Live By: Narrative Identity in a Postmodern World (2000), to more recent texts such as Analyzing Narrative Reality (2009)and Varieties of Narrative Analysis (2012), they have developed an analytic framework for researching stories and storytelling that is centered on the interplay of institutional discourses (big stories) on the one hand, and everyday accounts (little stories) on the other. The goal is the sociological understanding of formal and lived texts of experience, featuring the production, practices, and communication of accounts.

=== Inquiry approach===
In order to avoid "hardened stories," or "narratives that become context-free, portable and ready to be used anywhere and anytime for illustrative purposes" and are being used as [[conceptual metaphor]]s as defined by linguist [[George Lakoff]], an approach called [[narrative inquiry]] was proposed, resting on the epistemological assumption that human beings make sense of [[random]] or complex multicausal experience by the imposition of story structures."&lt;ref name="conlea"&gt;Conle, C. (2000). Narrative inquiry: Research tool and medium for professional development. European Journal of Teacher Education, 23(1), 49–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bell"&gt;Bell, J.S. (2002). Narrative Inquiry: More Than Just Telling Stories. TESOL Quarterly, 36(2), 207–213.&lt;/ref&gt; Human propensity to simplify data through a predilection for narratives over complex [[data]] sets typically leads to [[narrative fallacy]]. It is easier for the human mind to remember and make decisions on the basis of stories with meaning, than to remember strings of data. This is one reason why narratives are so powerful and why many of the classics in the humanities and social sciences are written in the narrative format. But humans read meaning into data and compose stories, even where this is unwarranted. In narrative inquiry, the way to avoid the narrative fallacy is no different from the way to avoid other error in scholarly research, i.e., by applying the usual methodical checks for [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and reliability in how data are collected, analyzed, and presented.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Several criteria for assessing the validity of narrative research was proposed, including the objective aspect, the emotional aspect, the social/moral aspect, and the clarity of the story.

===Mathematical sociology approach ===
In mathematical sociology, the theory of comparative narratives was devised in order to describe and compare the structures (expressed as "and" in a [[directed graph]] where multiple causal links incident into a node are conjoined) of action-driven sequential events.&lt;ref name="abell1987"&gt;Abell. P. (1987) The Syntax of Social Life: the theory and Method of Comparative Narratives, Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abell1993"&gt;Abell, P. (1993) Some Aspects of Narrative Method, Journal of Mathematical Sociology, 18. 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abell2009"&gt;Abell, P. (2009) A Case for Cases, Comparative Narratives in Sociological Explanation, Sociological Methods and Research, 32, 1-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narratives so conceived comprise the following ingredients:
* A finite set of state descriptions of the world S, the components of which are weakly ordered in time;
* A finite set of actors/agents (individual or collective), P;
* A finite set of actions A;
* A mapping of P onto A;

The structure ([[directed graph]]) is generated by letting the nodes stand for the states and the directed edges represent how the states are changed by specified actions. The action skeleton can then be abstracted, comprising a further digraph where the actions are depicted as nodes and edges take the form "action '''a''' co-determined (in context of other actions) action '''b'''".

Narratives can be both abstracted and generalised by imposing an [[Abstract algebra|algebra]] upon their structures and thence defining [[homomorphism]] between the algebras. The insertion of action-driven causal links in a narrative can be achieved using the method of Bayesian narratives.

;Bayesian narratives
Developed by [[Peter Abell]], the theory of Bayesian Narratives conceives a narrative as a [[directed graph]] comprising multiple causal links (social interactions) of the general form: "action '''''a''''' causes action '''''b''''' in a specified context". In the absence of sufficient comparative cases to enable statistical treatment of the causal links, items of evidence in support and against a particular causal link are assembled and used to compute the Bayesian likelihood ratio of the link. Subjective causal statements of the form "I/she did '''b''' because of '''a'''" and subjective [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactuals]] "if it had not been for '''a''' I/she would not have done '''b'''" are notable items of evidence.&lt;ref name="abell2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abell2011"&gt;Abell, P.

Linearity is one of several narrative qualities that can be found in a musical composition.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Gloag and David Beard, Musicology: The Key Concepts (New York: Routledge, 2009), 114&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by American musicologist, [[Edward Cone]], narrative terms are also present in the analytical language about music.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_a"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 113–117&lt;/ref&gt; The different components of a fugue — subject, answer, exposition, discussion and summary — can be cited as an example.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 115&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are several views on the concept of narrative in music and the role it plays.
One theory is that of Theodore Adorno, who has suggested that ‘music recites itself, is its own context, narrates without narrative’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag" /&gt; Another, is that of Carolyn Abbate, who has suggested that ‘certain gestures experienced in music constitute a narrating voice’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_a" /&gt; Still others have argued that narrative is a semiotic enterprise that can enrich musical analysis.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag" /&gt;
The French musicologist Jean-Jacques Nattiez contends that ‘the narrative, strictly speaking, is not in the music, but in the plot imagined and constructed by the listeners’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 116&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that discussing music in terms of [[narrativity]] is simply metaphorical and that the ‘imagined plot’ may be influenced by the work's title or other programmatic information provided by the composer.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b" /&gt; However, Abbate has revealed numerous examples of musical devices that function as narrative voices, by limiting music’s ability to narrate to rare ‘moments that can be identified by their bizarre and disruptive effect’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b" /&gt; Various theorists share this view of narrative appearing in disruptive rather than normative moments in music.
The final word is yet to be said, regarding narratives in music, as there is still much to be determined.

==In cultural storytelling==
A narrative can take on the shape of a story, which gives listeners an entertaining and collaborative avenue for acquiring knowledge. Many cultures use [[storytelling]] as a way to record histories, myths, and values. These stories can be seen as living entities of narrative among cultural communities, as they carry the shared experience and history of the culture within them. Stories are often used within [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|indigenous cultures]] in order to share knowledge to the younger generation.&lt;ref&gt;http://cojmc.unl.edu/nativedaughters/storytellers/native-storytellers-connect-the-past-and-the-future&lt;/ref&gt; Due to indigenous narratives leaving room for open-ended interpretation, native stories often engage children in the storytelling process so that they can make their own meaning and explanations within the story. This promotes holistic thinking among native children, which works towards merging an individual and world identity. Such an identity upholds native epistemology and gives children a sense of belonging as their cultural identity develops through the sharing and passing on of stories.&lt;ref&gt;Piquemal, N. 2003. From Native North American Oral Traditions to Western Literacy: Storytelling in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a number of indigenous stories are used to illustrate a value or lesson. In the [[Western Apache]] tribe, stories can be used to warn of the misfortune that befalls people when they do not follow acceptable behavior. One story speaks to the offense of a mother's meddling in her married son's life. In the story, the Western Apache tribe is under attack from a neighboring tribe, the Pimas. The Apache mother hears a scream. Thinking it is her son's wife screaming, she tries to intervene by yelling at him. This alerts the Pima tribe to her location, and she is promptly killed due to intervening in her son's life.&lt;ref&gt;Basso, 1984. "Stalking with Stories". Names, Places, and Moral Narratives Among the Western Apache.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous American cultures use [[Storytelling#Storytelling in indigenous cultures|storytelling]] to teach children the values and lessons of life. 
Although storytelling provides entertainment, its primary purpose is to educate.&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;Hodge, F., Pasqua, A., Marquez, C., &amp; Geishirt-Cantrell, B. (2002). Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian Communities. Journal of Transcultural Nursing, 6-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Alaskan Indigenous Natives state that narratives teach children where they fit in, what their society expects of them, how to create a peaceful living environment, and to be responsible, worthy members of their communities.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt; In the Mexican culture, many adult figures tell their children stories in order to teach children values such as individuality, obedience, honesty, trust, and compassion.&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;MacDonald, M., McDowell, J., Dégh, L., &amp; [[Toelken, B.]] (1999). Traditional storytelling today: An international sourcebook. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one of the versions of [[La Llorona]] is used to teach children to make safe decisions at night and to maintain the morals of the community.&lt;ref name="McDonald" /&gt;

Narratives are considered by the Canadian Métis community, to help children understand that the world around them is interconnected to their lives and communities.&lt;ref name="Iseke"&gt;Iseke, Judy. (1998). Learning Life Lessons from Indigenous Storytelling with Tom McCallum.
Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Métis community share the “Humorous Horse Story” to children, which portrays that horses stumble throughout life just like humans do.&lt;ref name="Iseke"/&gt; [[Navajo]] stories also use dead animals as metaphors by showing that all things have purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Eder, D. J. (2007). Bringing Navajo Storytelling Practices into Schools: The Importance of Maintaining Cultural Integrity. Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly, 38: 278–296.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, elders from [[Alaska Natives|Alaskan Native]] communities claim that the use of animals as metaphors allow children to form their own perspectives while at the same time self-reflecting on their own lives.&lt;ref name="Iseke"/&gt;

[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] elders also state that storytelling invites the listeners, especially children, to draw their own conclusions and perspectives while self-reflecting upon their lives.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt; Furthermore, they insist that narratives help children grasp and obtain a wide range of perspectives that help them interpret their lives in the context of the story. American Indian community members emphasize to children that the method of obtaining knowledge can be found in stories passed down through each generation. Moreover, community members also let the children interpret and build a different perspective of each story.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt;

==Historiography==
In [[historiography]], according to [[Lawrence Stone]], narrative has traditionally been the main [[rhetorical device]] used by historians. In 1979, at a time when the new [[Social History]] was demanding a social-science model of analysis, Stone detected a move back toward the narrative. Stone defined narrative as organized chronologically; focused on a single coherent story; descriptive rather than analytical; concerned with people not abstract circumstances; and dealing with the particular and specific rather than the collective and statistical. He reported that, "More and more of the '[[new historian]]s' are now trying to discover what was going on inside people's heads in the past, and what it was like to live in the past, questions which inevitably lead back to the use of narrative."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Stone, "The Revival of Narrative: Reflections on a New Old History," ''Past and Present'' 85 (1979), pp. 3–24, quote on 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers identify narratives with a type of explanation. [[Mark Bevir]] argues, for example, that narratives explain actions by appealing to the beliefs and desires of actors and by locating webs of beliefs in the context of historical traditions. Narrative is an alternative form of explanation to that associated with natural science.

Historians committed to a social science approach, however, have criticized the narrowness of narrative and its preference for anecdote over analysis, and clever examples rather than statistical regularities.&lt;ref&gt;J. Morgan Kousser, "The Revivalism of Narrative: A Response to Recent Criticisms of Quantitative History," ''Social Science History'' vol 8, no. 2 (Spring 1984): 133–49; Eric H. Monkkonen, "The Dangers of Synthesis," ''American Historical Review'' 91, no. 5 (December 1986): 1146–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storytelling rights ==
Storytelling rights may be broadly defined as the ethics of sharing narratives (including—but not limited to—firsthand, secondhand and imagined stories). In ''Storytelling Rights: The uses of oral and written texts by urban adolescents'', author Amy Shuman offers the following definition of storytelling rights: “the important and precarious relationship between narrative and event and, specifically, between the participants in an event and the reporters who claim the right to talk about what happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13643520|title=Storytelling rights : the uses of oral and written texts by urban adolescents|last=1951-|first=Shuman, Amy,|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521328462|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]|oclc=13643520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethics of retelling other people’s stories may be explored through a number of [[question]]s: whose [[Story arc|story]] is being told and how, what is the story’s purpose or aim, what does the story promise (for instance: empathy, redemption, authenticity, clarification)--and at whose benefit? Storytelling rights also implicates questions of consent, [[empathy]], and accurate representation. While storytelling—and retelling—can function as a powerful tool for [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and [[advocacy]], it can also lead to misunderstanding and exploitation.

[[Storytelling]] rights is notably important in the [[genre]] of [[personal experience]] narrative. Academic disciplines such as [[performance]], [[folklore]], [[literature]], [[anthropology]], [[Cultural studies|Cultural Studies]] and other [[social science]]s may involve the study of storytelling rights, often hinging on ethics.

{{Administrative law}}

In [[English law]], '''natural justice''' is [[technical terminology]] for the rule against bias (''[[nemo iudex in causa sua]]'') and the right to a fair hearing (''[[audi alteram partem]]''). While the term ''natural justice'' is often retained as a general concept, it has largely been replaced and extended by the general "duty to act fairly".

The basis for the rule against bias is the need to maintain public confidence in the legal system. Bias can take the form of actual bias, imputed bias or apparent bias. Actual bias is very difficult to prove in practice while imputed bias, once shown, will result in a decision being void without the need for any investigation into the likelihood or suspicion of bias. Cases from different jurisdictions currently apply two tests for apparent bias: the "reasonable suspicion of bias" test and the "real likelihood of bias" test. One view that has been taken is that the differences between these two tests are largely semantic and that they operate similarly.

The right to a fair hearing requires that individuals should not be penalized by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the case, a fair opportunity to answer it, and the opportunity to present their own case. The mere fact that a decision affects rights or interests is sufficient to subject the decision to the procedures required by natural justice. In Europe, the right to a fair hearing is guaranteed by [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights]], which is said to complement the [[common law]] rather than replace it.

==Background==
[[File:ON-CourSupreme 20090606-164356 panoramique.jpg|thumb|left|The courtroom of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]]. In 1999, the Court ruled in ''[[Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)]]'' that the requirements of natural justice vary according to the context of the matter arising.]]

Natural justice is a [[technical terminology|term of art]] that denotes specific procedural rights in the [[English law|English legal system]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Frederick F. Shauer|title=English Natural Justice and American Due Process: An Analytical Comparison|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmlr/vol18/iss1/3|journal=William and Mary Law Review|year=1976|volume=18|issue=1|pages=47–72 at 47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the systems of other nations based on it. It is similar to the American concepts of [[fair procedure]] and procedural [[due process]], the latter having roots that to some degree parallel the origins of natural justice.&lt;ref&gt;See generally {{citation|last=Bernard Schwartz|title=Administrative Procedure and Natural Law|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/tndl28&amp;div=11|journal=Notre Dame Lawyer|year=1953|volume=28|issue=2|page=169}}, cited in Shauer, "English Natural Justice and American Due Process", p. 51, n. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is because the expression natural justice has been associated, perhaps too closely associated, with procedures followed by courts of law.}} and the United Kingdom,{{r|De Smith's Judicial Review|p=320}} it has largely been replaced and extended by the more general "duty to act fairly". Natural justice is identified with the two constituents of a fair hearing,{{r|De Smith's Judicial Review|p=322}} which are the rule against bias (''[[nemo iudex in causa sua]]'', or "no man a judge in his own cause"), and the right to a fair hearing (''[[audi alteram partem]]'', or "hear the other side").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=David Phillip Jones|author2=Anne S. de Villars|chapter=Natural Justice and the Duty to be Fair|title=Principles of Administrative Law|edition=5th|publisher=[[Carswell (publisher)|Carswell]]|year=2009|pages=208–223 at 209|isbn=978-0-7798-2126-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirements of natural justice or a duty to act fairly depend on the context.{{r|Kioa v West|pages=584–585|q=What is appropriate in terms of natural justice depends on the circumstances of the case and they will include, inter alia, the nature of the inquiry, the subject-matter, and the rules under which the decision-maker is acting.}} In ''[[Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)]]'' (1999),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)|link=Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)|year=1999|source=CanLII|num=699|parallelcite=[1999] 2 [[Supreme Court Reports (Canada)|S.C.R.]] 817|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] set out a list of non-exhaustive factors that would influence the content of the duty of fairness, including the nature of the decision being made and the process followed in making it, the statutory scheme under which the decision-maker operates, the importance of the decision to the person challenging it, the person's [[legitimate expectation]]s, and the choice of procedure made by the decision-maker.&lt;ref&gt;''Baker'', paras. 23–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, in ''[[Knight v. Indian Head School Division No. 19]]'' (1990),&lt;ref name="Knight"&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Knight v. Indian Head School Division No. 19|link=Knight v. Indian Head School Division No. 19|year=1990|source=CanLII|num=138|parallelcite=[1990] 1 S.C.R. 653|courtname=S.C.|juris=Canada}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held that public authorities which make decisions of a legislative and general nature do not have a duty to act fairly, while those that carry out acts of a more administrative and specific nature do. Furthermore, preliminary decisions will generally not trigger the duty to act fairly, but decisions of a more final nature may have such an effect.&lt;ref name="Knight"/&gt;{{rp|para 30}} In addition, whether a duty to act fairly applies depends on the relationship between the public authority and the individual. No duty exists where the relationship is one of master and servant, or where the individual holds office at the pleasure of the authority. On the other hand, a duty to act fairly exists where the individual cannot be removed from office except for cause.&lt;ref name="Knight"/&gt;{{rp|para 32}} Finally, a right to procedural fairness only exists when an authority's decision is significant and has an important impact on the individual.&lt;ref name="Knight"/&gt;{{rp|para 39}}

==Rule against bias==

===In general===
A person is barred from deciding any case in which he or she may be, or may fairly be suspected to be, biased. This principle embodies the basic concept of impartiality,&lt;ref name=Kanda&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Surinder Singh Kanda v Federation of Malaya]] |court=UKPC|year=1962|num=2|parallelcite=[1962] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 322 at 337|courtname=auto|juris=Malaya}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and applies to courts of law, tribunals, arbitrators and all those having the duty to act judicially.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Lord Mackay of Clashfern, ed.-in-chief|authorlink=James Mackay, Baron Mackay of Clashfern|title=[[Halsbury's Laws of England]]|edition=5th|volume=61|location=London|publisher=[[LexisNexis]]|year=2010|at=para. 629|isbn=978-1-4057-3424-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A public authority has a duty to act judicially whenever it makes decisions that affect people's rights or interests, and not only when it applies some judicial-type procedure in arriving at decisions.&lt;ref&gt;See the "[[#In general 2|Right to a fair hearing]]" section below.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis on which impartiality operates is the need to maintain public confidence in the legal system. The erosion of public confidence undermines the nobility of the legal system and leads to ensuing chaos.&lt;ref name="Tang Kin Hwa"&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Tang Kin Hwa v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board|court=SGHC|year=2005|num=153|parallelcite=[2005] 4 S.L.R.(R.) [''Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)''] 604 at 610, para. 11|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The essence of the need for impartiality was observed by [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]], the [[Master of the Rolls]], in ''Metropolitan Properties Co (FGC) Ltd v Lannon'' (1968):&lt;ref name="Metropolitan Properties"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Metropolitan Properties Co (FGC) Ltd v Lannon|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1968|num=5|parallelcite=[1969] 1 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 577|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Justice must be rooted in confidence and confidence is destroyed when right-minded people go away thinking: 'The judge was biased.'"{{r|Metropolitan Properties|page=599}}

Public confidence as the basis for the rule against bias is also embodied in the often-quoted words of [[Gordon Hewart, 1st Viscount Hewart|Lord Hewart]], the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], that "[i]t is not merely of some importance, but of fundamental importance that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly be seen to be done".&lt;ref&gt;
''[[R v Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy]]'' [1924] 1 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 256 at 259, [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ([[King's Bench]]) (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forms of bias===

====Actual and imputed bias====
[[File:Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham by Charles Robert Leslie cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|A portrait of the [[Lord Chancellor]], Lord Cottenham ([[Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham]], 1781–1851), by [[Charles Robert Leslie]]. In ''[[Dimes v Grand Junction Canal]]'' (1852), his Lordship was disqualified from hearing a case as he had a pecuniary interest in the outcome.]]

Bias may be actual, imputed or apparent. Actual bias is established where it is actually established that a decision-maker was prejudiced in favour of or against a party. However, in practice, the making of such an allegation is rare as it is very hard to prove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Chee Siok Chin v. Attorney-General|court=SGHC|year=2006|num=153|parallelcite=[2006] 4 S.L.R.(R.) 541 at 547–548, para. 9|courtname=H.C.|juris=Singapore}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One form of imputed bias is based on the decision-maker being a party to a suit, or having a pecuniary or proprietary interest in the outcome of the decision. Once this fact has been established, the bias is irrebuttable and disqualification is automatic – the decision-maker will be barred from adjudicating the matter without the need for any investigation into the likelihood or suspicion of bias.&lt;ref name=Dimes&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=[[Dimes v Grand Junction Canal Proprietors]] |reporter=ER|fullstops=on|year=1852|num=789|volume=10|firstpage=301|parallelcite=3 H.L. Cas. 759|courtname=[[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]|juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A classic case is ''[[Dimes v Grand Junction Canal]]'' (1852),&lt;ref name=Dimes/&gt; which involved an action between Dimes, a local landowner, and the proprietors of the [[Grand Junction Canal]], in which the [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham|Lord Cottenham]], had affirmed decrees made to the proprietors. However, it was discovered by Dimes that Lord Cottenham in fact owned several pounds worth of shares in the Grand Junction Canal. This eventually led to the judge being disqualified from deciding the case. There was no inquiry as to whether a reasonable person would consider Lord Cottenham to be biased, or as to the circumstances which led Lord Cottenham to hear the case.

In certain limited situations, bias can also be imputed when the decision-maker's interest in the decision is not pecuniary but personal. This was established in the unprecedented case of ''[[R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No.2)]]'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No. 2)|link=R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No.2)|court=UKHL|year=1999|num=1|parallelcite=[2000] 1 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 119 at 133|courtname=[[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]|juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In an appeal to the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] sought to overturn a [[certiorari|quashing order]] made by the [[Divisional Court (England and Wales)|Divisional Court]] regarding [[extradition]] [[warrant (law)|warrants]] made against the ex-Chilean dictator, Senator [[Augusto Pinochet]]. [[Amnesty International]] (AI) was given leave to [[intervention (law)|intervene]] in the proceedings. However, one of the judges of the case, [[Leonard Hoffmann, Baron Hoffmann|Lord Hoffmann]], was a director and chairperson of [[Amnesty International Charity Ltd]]. (AICL), a company under the control of AI. He was eventually disqualified from the case and the outcome of the proceedings set aside. The House of Lords held that the close connection between AICL and AI presented Lord Hoffmann with an interest in the outcome of the litigation. Even though it was non-pecuniary, the [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lords]] took the view that the interest was sufficient to warrant Lord Hoffmann's automatic disqualification from hearing the case. In ''Locabail (UK) Ltd v Bayfield Properties Ltd'' (1999),&lt;ref name="Locabail"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Locabail (UK) Ltd v Bayfield Properties Ltd.|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1999|num=3004|parallelcite=[2000] [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 451|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] warned against any further extension of the automatic disqualification rule, "unless plainly required to give effect to the important underlying principles upon which the rule is based".{{r|Locabail|page=465}}

====Apparent bias====
Apparent bias is present where a judge or other decision-maker is not a party to a matter and does not have an interest in its outcome, but through his or her conduct or behaviour gives rise to a suspicion that he or she is not impartial.&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Pinochet'', pp. 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt; An issue that has arisen is the degree of suspicion which would provide the grounds on which a decision should be set aside for apparent bias. Currently, cases from various jurisdictions apply two different tests: "real likelihood of bias" and "reasonable suspicion of bias".

The real likelihood test centres on whether the facts, as assessed by the court, give rise to a real likelihood of bias.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Rand'' (1866) LR 1 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 230 at 233, [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ([[Queen's Bench]]) (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''R v Gough'' (1993),&lt;ref name="R v Gough"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R v Gough |court=UKHL |year=1993 |num=1 |parallelcite=[1993] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 646 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the House of Lords chose to state the test in terms of a "real danger of bias", and emphasized that the test was concerned with the possibility, not probability, of bias. [[Robert Goff, Baron Goff of Chieveley|Lord Goff of Chievely]] also stated that "the court should look at the matter through the eyes of a reasonable man, because the court in cases such as these personifies the reasonable man".{{r|R v Gough|page=670}} However, the test in ''Gough'' has been disapproved of in some Commonwealth jurisdictions. One criticism is that the emphasis on the court's view of the facts gives insufficient emphasis to the perception of the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|30|1994|litigants=Webb v The Queen |parallelcite=(1994) 181 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 41 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These criticisms were addressed by the House of Lords in ''[[Porter v Magill]]'' (2001).&lt;ref name="Porter v Magill"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Porter v Magill |link=Porter v Magill |court=UKHL |year=2001 |num=67 |parallelcite=[2002] 2 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 357|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court adjusted the ''Gough'' test by stating it to be "whether the fair-minded and informed observer, having considered the facts, would conclude that there was a real possibility that the tribunal was biased".{{r|Porter v Magill|page=494|q=paragraph 103}} This case therefore established the current test in the UK to be one of a "real possibility of bias".

On the other hand, the reasonable suspicion test asks whether a reasonable and fair-minded person sitting in court and knowing all the relevant facts would have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the litigant is not possible.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Liverpool City Justices, ex parte Topping'' [1983] 1 W.L.R. 119 at 123, [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ([[Queen's Bench]]) (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; Although not currently adopted in the UK, this test has been endorsed by the [[judicial system of Singapore|Singapore courts]].&lt;ref&gt;''Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v. Lee Kuan Yew'' [1992] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 791 at 825–826, paras. 80–83, C.A.; ''Tang Liang Hong v. Lee Kuan Yew'' [1997] 3 S.L.R.(R.) 576 at 595–596, para. 46, C.A.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the differences between the two tests are largely semantic and that the two tests operate similarly. In ''Locabail'', the judges stated that in a large proportion of the cases, application of the two tests would lead to the same outcome. It was also held that "[p]rovided that the court, personifying the reasonable man, takes an approach which is based on broad common sense, and without inappropriate reliance on special knowledge, the minutiae of court procedure or other matters outside the ken of the ordinary, reasonably well-informed members of the public, there should be no risk that the courts will not ensure both that justice is done and that it is perceived by the public to be done".{{r|Locabail|page=477|q=paragraph 17}} In the [[High Court of Singapore|Singapore High Court]] decision ''Tang Kin Hwa v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board'' (2005),&lt;ref name="Tang Kin Hwa"/&gt; [[Judicial Commissioner]] [[Andrew Phang]] observed that the real likelihood test is in reality similar to that of reasonable suspicion. First, ''likelihood'' is in fact "possibility", as opposed to the higher standard of proof centring on "probability". Secondly, he suggested that ''real'' in ''real likelihood'' cannot be taken to mean "actual", as this test relates to apparent and not actual bias. He also observed that both the court's and the public's perspectives are "integral parts of a holistic process" with no need to draw a sharp distinction between them.{{r|Tang Kin Hwa|p=617–8|q=paragraphs 39–40}}

In contrast, in ''[[Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni]]'' (2006),&lt;ref name="Shankar Alan"&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni|link=Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni|court=SGHC|year=2006|num=194|parallelcite=[2007] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 85|courtname=H.C.|juris=Singapore}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Judicial Commissioner [[Sundaresh Menon]] thought that there was a real difference between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests.{{r|Shankar Alan|p=101|q=paragraph 56}} In his opinion, ''suspicion'' suggests a belief that something that may not be provable could still be possible. ''Reasonable'' suggests that the belief cannot be fanciful. Here the issue is whether it is reasonable for the one to harbour the suspicions in the circumstances even though the suspicious behaviour could be innocent. On the other hand, ''likelihood'' points towards something being likely, and ''real'' suggests that this must be substantial rather than imagined. Here, then, the inquiry is directed more towards the actor than the observer. The issue is the degree to which a particular event is not likely or possible{{r|Shankar Alan|p=99|q=paragraphs 49-50}} Menon J.C. also disagreed with both Lord Goff in ''Gough'' and Phang J.C. in ''Tang Kin Hwa'' in that he thought the shift of the inquiry from how the matter might appear to a reasonable man to whether the judge thinks there is a sufficient possibility of bias was "a very significant point of departure".{{r|Shankar Alan|p=103|q=paragraph 62}} The real likelihood test is met as long as the court is satisfied that there is a sufficient degree of possibility of bias. Although this a lower standard than satisfaction on a [[legal burden of proof#Preponderance of the evidence|balance of probabilities]], this is actually directed at mitigating the sheer difficulty of proving actual bias, especially given its insidious and often subconscious nature. The reasonable suspicion test, however, is met if the court is satisfied that a reasonable member of the public could harbour a reasonable suspicion of bias even though the court itself thought there was no real danger of this on the facts. The difference is that the driver behind this test is the strong public interest in ensuring public confidence in the administration of justice.{{r|Shankar Alan|p=107–8|q=paragraphs 74-75}} As of September 2011, the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore]] had not yet expressed a view as to whether the position taken in ''Tang Kin Hwa'' or ''Shankar Alan'' is preferable.

===Exceptions to the rule against bias===

====Necessity====
There are cases in which a disqualified adjudicator cannot be replaced, as no one else is authorized to act. It has been observed that "disqualification of an adjudicator will not be permitted to destroy the only tribunal with power to act".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Geoffrey A. Flick|title=Natural Justice: Principles and Applications|location=London|publisher=[[LexisNexis Butterworths|Butterworths]]|year=1979|pages=138–139|isbn=978-0-409-35260-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, natural justice has to give way to necessity in order to maintain the integrity of judicial and administrative systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Great Charte v Kennington|reporter=ER|fullstops=on|year=1795|num=490|volume=93|firstpage=1107|parallelcite=2 Str. 1173}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This issue regarding necessity was raised in ''Dimes''.&lt;ref name=Dimes/&gt; The Lord Chancellor had to sign an order for enrolment in order to allow the appeal to proceed from the [[Chancellor of the High Court|Vice-Chancellor]] to the House of Lords. It was held that his shareholding in the canal company which barred him from sitting in the appeal did not affect his power to enroll, as no one but him had the authority to do so. It was mentioned this was allowed "for this [was] a case of necessity, and where that occurs the objection of interest cannot prevail".{{r|Dimes|p=787|q=3 H.L. Cas. at 787, 10 E.R. at 313}}

====Waiver====
The court normally requests that an objection be taken as soon as the prejudiced party has knowledge of the bias.&lt;ref&gt;''Wakefield Local Board of Health v West Riding and Grimsby Rly. Co.'' (1865) L.R. 1 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 84, [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ([[Queen's Bench]]) (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; If an objection is not raised and proceedings are allowed to continue without disapproval, it will be held that the party has waived its right to do so.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Byles, ex parte Hollidge'' (1912) 77 J.P. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect of a finding of bias===
In ''Dimes'',&lt;ref name=Dimes/&gt; the judges advised the House of Lords that Lord Cottenham's pecuniary interest made his judgment not [[void (law)|void]], but [[voidable]]. This advice is not wrong in the context of a judicial act under review, where the judgment will be held valid unless reversed on appeal.&lt;ref name="Wade &amp; Forsyth"&gt;{{citation|first1=H.W.R. |last=Wade |authorlink=Henry William Rawson Wade |first2=C.F. |last2=Forsyth|title=Administrative Law|edition=10th|location=Oxford; New York, N.Y.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|page=400|isbn=978-0-19-921973-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the cases of administrative acts or decisions under judicial review, the court can only intervene on the grounds of ''[[ultra vires]]'',{{r|Wade &amp; Forsyth|p=401}} hence making the judgment void. [[William Brett, 1st Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]] said in ''Allison v General Council of Medical Education and Registration'' (1894)&lt;ref name="Allison"&gt;''Allison v General Council of Medical Education and Registration'' [1894] 1 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 750, [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]] (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; that the participation of a disqualified person "certainly rendered the decision wholly void".{{r|Allison|p=757}}

==Right to a fair hearing==

===In general===
[[File:ICJ-CJI hearing 1.jpg|thumb|A hearing of the [[International Court of Justice]] in 2006 presided over by its President, Her Excellency Dame [[Rosalyn Higgins]]. A fundamental aspect of natural justice is that before a decision is made, all parties should be heard on the matter.]]

It has been suggested that the rule requiring a fair hearing is broad enough to include the rule against bias since a fair hearing must be an unbiased hearing. However, the rules are often treated separately. It is fundamental to fair procedure that both sides should be heard.{{r|Wade &amp; Forsyth|p=402}} The right to a fair hearing requires that individuals are not penalized by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the cases against them, a fair opportunity to answer them, and the opportunity to present their own cases.&lt;ref name="Thio"&gt;{{citation|author=Thio Li-ann|authorlink=Thio Li-ann|chapter=Law and the Administrative State|editor=Kevin Y[ew] L[ee] Tan|title=The Singapore Legal System|edition=2nd|location=Singapore|publisher=[[National University of Singapore|Singapore University Press]]|year=1999|pages=160–229 at 192–193|isbn=978-9971-69-213-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides promoting an individual's liberties, the right to a fair hearing has also been used by courts as a base on which to build up fair administrative procedures.{{r|Wade &amp; Forsyth|p=402}} It is now well established that it is not the character of the public authority that matters but the character of the power exercised.{{r|Wade &amp; Forsyth|p=405}} However, in the United Kingdom prior to ''[[Ridge v Baldwin]]'' (1963),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Ridge v Baldwin]] |court=UKHL|year=1963|num=2|parallelcite=[1964] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 40|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the scope of the right to a fair hearing was severely restricted by case law following ''Cooper v Wandsworth Board of Works'' (1863).&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Cooper v Wandsworth Board of Works|reporter=ER|fullstops=on|year=1863|num=424|volume=143|firstpage=414|parallelcite=14 C.B.N.S. 180|courtname=[[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]]|juris=England}}. This was seen in cases such as ''Local Government Board v Arlidge'' [1915] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 120, [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] (UK); and ''R v Leman Street Police Station Inspector, ex parte Venicoff'' [1920] 3 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 72, [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ([[Kings Bench]]) (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''R v Electricity Commissioners, ex parte London Electricity Joint Committee Co. (1920), Ltd.'' (1923),&lt;ref name="1924 1 KB 171"&gt;''R v Electricity Commissioners, ex parte London Electricity Joint Committee Co. (1920), Ltd.'' [1924] 1 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 171, [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ([[Kings Bench]]) (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Atkin, Baron Atkin|Lord Atkin]] observed that the right only applied where decision-makers had "the duty to act judicially".{{r|1924 1 KB 171|p=205}} In natural justice cases this ''[[obiter dictum|dictum]]'' was generally understood to mean that a duty to act judicially was not to be inferred merely from the impact of a decision on the rights of subjects; such a duty would arise only if there was a "superadded" express obligation to follow a judicial-type procedure in arriving at the decision.{{r|De Smith's Judicial Review|p=330}}

In ''Ridge v Baldwin'', [[James Reid, Baron Reid|Lord Reid]] reviewed the authorities extensively and attacked the problem at its root by demonstrating how the term ''judicial'' had been misinterpreted as requiring some additional characteristic over and above the characteristic that the power affected some person's rights. In his view, the mere fact that the power affects rights or interests is what makes it "judicial" and so subject to the procedures required by natural justice.{{r|Wade &amp; Forsyth|p=413–5}}&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite CanLII|litigants=Nicholson v. Haldimand-Norfolk Regional Police Commissioners|link=Nicholson v. Haldimand-Norfolk Reg.

The mere fact that a decision-maker is conferred wide discretion by law is not reason enough for a weakening of the requirements of natural justice. In the United Kingdom context, this is demonstrated by ''Ahmed v H.M. Treasury (No. 1)'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Ahmed v Her Majesty's Treasury|court=UKSC|year=2010|num=2|parallelcite=[2010] 2 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 534|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] had exercised powers to freeze the appellants' financial assets and economic resources on the ground that it reasonably suspected the appellants were or might be persons who had committed, attempted to commit, participated in or facilitated the commission of terrorism, pursuant to the [[Terrorism Acts|Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Terrorism Acts|Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006]] ([[Statutory Instrument (UK)|S.I.]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/2657/contents/made 2006 No. 2657]).&lt;/ref&gt; and the Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006&lt;ref&gt;Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/2952/contents/made S.I. 2006 No. 2952]).&lt;/ref&gt; made under the [[United Nations Act 1946]].&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations Act 1946]] ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/9-10/45/contents 1946 c. 45]), s. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] held that since the Al-Qaida Order made no provision for basic procedural fairness, it effectively deprived people designated under the order the fundamental right of access to a judicial remedy and hence was ''[[ultra vires]]'' the power conferred by the United Nations Act 1946 for the making of the Order.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, ''Ahmed'', p. 685, para 246, ''per'' [[Jonathan Mance, Baron Mance|Lord Mance]] [[Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|J.S.C.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Article 6 of the European Convention===
The right to a fair hearing is also referred to in [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]], which states:&lt;ref&gt;Art. 6(3) sets out some of the requirements of the right to a fair hearing, but only in the context of criminal proceedings.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. ...}}

Article 6 does not, however, replace the common law duty to ensure a fair hearing. It has been suggested that Article 6 alone is not enough to protect procedural due process, and only with the development of a more sophisticated common law will the protection of procedural due process extend further into the administrative machine.{{r|Wade &amp; Forsyth|p=405}} Nonetheless, Article 6 supplements the common law. For example, the common law does not impose a general duty to give reasons for a decision, but under Article 6(1) a decision-maker must give a reasoned judgment so as to enable an affected individual to decide whether to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Hadjianastassiou v Greece|court=ECHR|year=1992|num=78|parallelcite=(1992) 16 E.H.R.R. 219|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aspects of a fair hearing===

====Prior notice of hearing====
Natural justice allows a person to claim the right to adequate notification of the date, time, place of the hearing as well as detailed notification of the case to be met.&lt;ref name="Thio"/&gt; This information allows the person adequate time to effectively prepare his or her own case and to answer the case against him or her. In ''Cooper v Wandsworth'',&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt; [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas|Chief Justice]] [[William Erle]] went so far as to state that the lack of notice and hearing afforded to Cooper could be said to be a form of abuse, as he had been treated as if he did not matter.&lt;ref name="Endicott"&gt;{{citation|author=Timothy Endicott|title=Administrative Law|location=New York, N.Y.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|page=110|isbn=978-0-19-927728-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Michael Mustill, Baron Mustill|Lord Mustill]] famously held in ''[[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex p Doody]]'' (1993): "Since the person affected usually cannot make worthwhile representations without knowing what factors may weigh against his interests fairness will very often require that he is informed of the gist of the case which he has to answer."&lt;ref name=Doody&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Doody|link=R v Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex p Doody|court=UKHL|year=1993|num=8|parallelcite=[1994] 1 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 531 at 560|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|Kioa v West|page=582|q=It is a fundamental rule of the common law doctrine of natural justice expressed in traditional terms that, generally speaking, when an order is to be made which will deprive a person of some right or interest or the legitimate expectation of a benefit, he is entitled to know the case sought to be made against him and to be given an opportunity of replying to it ... . The reference to right or interest in this formulation must be understood as relating to personal liberty, status, preservation of livelihood and reputation, as well as to proprietary rights and interests.}}

It has been suggested that the requirement of prior notice serves three important purposes:{{r|Endicott|p=127}}

*The interest in good outcomes – giving prior notice increases the value of the proceedings as it is only when the interested person knows the issues and the relevant information that he or she can make a useful contribution.
*The duty of respect – the affected person has the right to know what is at stake, and it is not enough to simply inform him or her that there will be a hearing.
*The [[rule of law]] – notice of issues and disclosure of information opens up the operations of the public authority to public scrutiny.

The British courts have held it is not enough for an affected person to merely be informed of a hearing. He or she must also be told what is at stake; in other words, the gist of the case.{{r|Endicott|p=127}}

====Opportunity to be heard====
Every person has the right to have a hearing and be allowed to present his or her own case.{{r|Kioa v West|page=582}} Should a person not attend the hearing, even with adequate notice given, the adjudicator has the discretion to decide if the hearing should proceed. In ''Ridge v Baldwin'', a [[Chief Constable|chief constable]] succeeded in having his dismissal from service declared void as he had not been given the opportunity to make a defence. In another case, ''Chief Constable of the North Wales Police v Evans'' (1982),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Chief Constable of the North Wales Police v Evans|court=UKHL|year=1982|num=10|parallelcite=[1982] 1 W.L.R. 1155|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a chief constable required a police probationer to resign on account of allegations about his private life which he was given no fair opportunity to rebut. The House of Lords found the dismissal to be unlawful. Likewise in ''[[Surinder Singh Kanda v Federation of Malaya]]'' (1962),&lt;ref name=Kanda/&gt; a public servant facing disciplinary proceedings was not supplied with a copy of a prejudicial report by a board of inquiry which the adjudicating officer had access to before the hearing. The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] held that the proceedings had failed to provide him a reasonable opportunity of being heard.

However, this requirement does not necessarily mean the decision-maker has to meet the complainant face to face – "Natural justice does not generally demand orality".&lt;ref name="Morgan Grenfell"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. (Morgan Grenfell &amp; Co Ltd) v Special Commissioner of Income Tax|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=2001|num=329|parallelcite=[2002] 2 W.L.R. 255 at 286, para. 47|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that an oral hearing will almost be as good as useless if the affected person has no prior knowledge of the case.{{r|Morgan Grenfell|p=287|q=paragraph 50}} In ''Lloyd v McMahon'' (1987),&lt;ref name="Lloyd"&gt;''Lloyd v McMahon'' [1987] 1 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 625, [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] (UK).&lt;/ref&gt; an oral hearing did not make a difference to the facts on which the case was based. Giving judgment in the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, [[Lord Justice of Appeal|Lord Justice]] [[Harry Woolf, Baron Woolf|Harry Woolf]] held that an oral hearing may not always be the "very pith of the administration of natural justice".{{r|Lloyd|p=670|q=citing R v Local Government Board, ex parte Arlidge [1914] 1 KB 160 at 192–193, High Court (Kings Bench) (England &amp; Wales).}} It has also been suggested that an oral hearing is only required if issues concerning deprivations of legal rights or legally protected interests arise.{{r|Endicott|p=128}}

====Conduct of the hearing====
When deciding how the hearing should be conducted, the adjudicator has to ask whether the person charged has a proper opportunity to consider, challenge or contradict any evidence, and whether the person is also fully aware of the nature of the allegations against him or her so as to have a proper opportunity to present his or her own case.&lt;ref name="Kay Swee Pin"&gt;''Kay Swee Pin v. Singapore Island Country Club'' [2008] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 802 at 806, para. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Secretary of State for the Home Department v AF'' (2009),&lt;ref name="AF"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Secretary of State for the Home Department v AF|court=UKHL|year=2009|num=28|parallelcite=[2010] 2 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 269|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Phillips, Baron Phillips of Worth Matravers|Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers]] said:

{{quote|The best way of producing a fair trial is to ensure that a party to it has the fullest information of both the allegations that are made against him and the evidence relied upon in support of those allegations. Where the evidence is documentary, he should have access to the documents. Where the evidence consists of oral testimony, then he should be entitled to cross-examine the witnesses who give that testimony, whose identities should be disclosed.{{r|AF|p=355|q=paragraph 64}}}}

However, when a hearing requires the balancing of multiple [[wikt:polycentric|polycentric]] issues such as natural justice and the protection of confidential information for national security reasons, both the concerns of public security and the right to a fair trial must be adequately met. It was held by the House of Lords in ''AF'',{{r|AF}} applying the decision of the Grand Chamber of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ''A v United Kingdom'' (2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=A v United Kingdom|court=ECHR|year=2009|num=301|parallelcite=(2009) 49 E.H.R.R. 625|courtname=E.C.H.R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a person accused of terrorism against whom a [[control order]] has been issued must be given sufficient information about the allegations against him to enable him to give effective instructions to his [[special advocate]]. If this requirement is satisfied, a fair hearing can be conducted without detailed disclosure of confidential information that might compromise national security. On the facts of the case, a special advocate was not permitted further contact with an applicant or his ordinary legal representatives except with permission of the [[Special Immigration Appeals Commission]] (SIAC) after viewing confidential (or "closed") materials. The House of Lords recognized that although a special advocate's usefulness is stymied somewhat from having no further instructions after viewing such materials, if the SIAC decides to issue a control order predominantly on the basis of non-confidential (or "open") materials, an applicant cannot be regarded as having been denied an opportunity to challenge the reasonableness of the government's beliefs and suspicions about him. If the evidence against the applicant is largely closed but allegations contained in open material are sufficiently specific, an applicant should be able to provide his legal representatives and special advocate with information to refute it (such as an [[alibi]], if the open material alleges he was at a certain place during a certain period) without having to know the detail or sources of the closed evidence. However, if the evidence revealed to the person consists only of general assertions and the case against him is based solely or to a substantive extent on undisclosed adverse evidence, the fair hearing rule under natural justice will not be satisfied.{{r|AF|p=350-2|q=paragraph 51, citing A v United Kingdom, paragraphs 215–220}}

In such cases, there are strong policy considerations supporting the principle that a trial procedure can never be considered fair if a person is kept in ignorance of the case against him or her. First, since the grounds for a reasonable suspicion that a person is involved in terrorist activity can span from incontrovertible evidence to an innocent misinterpretation of facts which can be explained away by the person, in many cases it is impossible for courts to be sure that the disclosure of the evidence will make no difference to the applicant. Secondly, resentment will be felt by the person and his family and friends if sanctions are imposed without any proper explanation of the grounds and when, due to the non-disclosure of information, the person is put in a position where he is unable to properly defend himself. As Lord Phillips put it, "if the wider public are to have confidence in the justice system, they need to be able to see that justice is done rather than being asked to take it on trust".{{r|AF|p=355|q=paragraph 63}}

The right to be heard in answer to charges before an unbiased tribunal is illustrated in the Singapore case ''Tan Boon Chee David v. Medical Council of Singapore'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;''Tan Boon Chee David v. Medical Council of Singapore'' [1979–1980] S.L.R.(R.) 523, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; During a disciplinary hearing, council members were either not conscientious about their attendance or did not attend the whole course of proceedings. This meant they did not hear all the oral evidence and submissions. The High Court held that this had substantially prejudiced the appellant and constituted a fundamental breach of natural justice. On the other hand, mere absence from a hearing does not necessarily lead to undue prejudice. It was held in ''Re Teo Choo Hong'' (1995)&lt;ref&gt;''Re Teo Choo Hong'' [1995] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 441, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; that the function of a lay member of a lawyers' disciplinary committee was to observe and not cast a vote or make a judgment. Thus, the appellant had not suffered undue prejudice.

On the basis of reciprocity, if one side is allowed to cross-examine his legal opponent at a hearing, the other party must also be given the same opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;''Howe Yoon Chong v Chief Assessor'' [1977–1978] S.L.R.(R.) 386, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, when a tribunal decides a case on a basis not raised or contemplated by the parties, or decides it without regarding the submissions and arguments made by the parties on the issues, this will amount to a breach of natural justice.&lt;ref&gt;''Front Row Investment Holdings (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. v. Daimler South East Asia Pte. Ltd.'' [2010] SGHC 80 at para. 31, H.C. (Singapore); see also ''R v Industrial Injuries Commissioner, ex parte Howarth'' (1968) 4 K.I.R. 621; ''Kay Swee Pin'', p. 806, para. 7: "[I]f a tribunal, after the close of the hearing, comes into possession of further evidence, the party affected should be invited to comment upon it".&lt;/ref&gt; However, a genuine ''[[good faith#Good faith in law|bona fide]]'' mistake by an adjudicator in omitting to state reasons for not considering a submission is not enough to be a breach of natural justice.&lt;ref name="SEF Construction"&gt;''SEF Construction Pte. Ltd. v. Skoy Connected Pte. Ltd.'' [2010] 1 S.L.R. 733 at 757, para. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; This may occur when the submissions were accidentally omitted, or were so unconvincing that it was not necessary to explicitly state the adjudicator's findings.{{r|SEF Construction|pp=758–759|q=paragraph 60}}

====Right to legal representation====
There is no inherent common law right to legal representation before a domestic tribunal. A tribunal has the discretion to admit either a legally qualified or unqualified counsel to assist the person appearing before it, based on the facts of the case.&lt;ref&gt;''Kok Seng Chong v. Bukit Turf Club'' [1992] 3 S.L.R.(R.) 772, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; When assessing whether a party should be offered legal assistance, the adjudicator should first ask whether the right to be heard applies, and, secondly, whether counsel's assistance is needed for an effective hearing given the subject matter, bearing in mind the consequences of such a denial.{{r|Thio|p=192}}

In ''R v Secretary of State for Home Department, ex parte Tarrant'' (1983),&lt;ref name="ex parte Tarrant"&gt;''R v Secretary of State for Home Department, ex parte Tarrant'' [1985] 1 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 251, [[Divisional Court (England and Wales)|Divisional Court]] (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; Webster J. set out six factors to be considered when deciding whether to allow representation by counsel, namely:{{r|ex parte Tarrant|pp=285–6}}

*the seriousness of the charge and the potential penalty;
*whether any points of law are likely to arise.;
*whether the prisoner is capable of presenting his own case;
*whether there are any procedural difficulties faced by prisoners in conducting their own defence;
*whether there is reasonable speed in making the adjudication; and
*whether there is a need for fairness between prisoners or between prisoners and prison officers.

It has also been suggested that where a tribunal hearing concerns the individual's reputation or right to livelihood, there is a greater need for allowing legal representation as this vindicates the idea of [[equality before the law]].&lt;ref&gt;''Doresamy v. Public Services Commission'' [1971] 2 ''Malayan Law Journal'' 127, [[High Courts of Malaysia|High Court]] (Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt;

When one refuses legal representation, one cannot expect to receive a higher "standard" of natural justice. This was enunciated in Singapore in ''Ho Paul v. Singapore Medical Council'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;''Ho Paul v. Singapore Medical Council'' [2008] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 780, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Ho, who had been charged with professional misconduct, chose to appear before the Council in person and declined to cross-examine the Council's key witness. Subsequently, he argued that he should have been warned of the legal implications of not being legally represented. The High Court rejected this argument and held he had suffered no prejudice. Dr. Ho had been given a fair opportunity of presenting his own case and, most importantly, had not been deprived of his right to cross-examine the witnesses.

It is also not a court's obligation to provide assistance when a party presents his or her case without legal representation. In ''Rajeevan Edakalavan v. Public Prosecutor'' (1998),&lt;ref name="Rajeevan Edakalavan"&gt;''Rajeevan Edakalavan v. Public Prosecutor'' [1998] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 10, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; the accused had appeared in person before a magistrate and had entered a [[plea]] of guilt. He later petitioned the High Court for criminal revision, arguing that as the magistrate had not informed him of the [[defense (legal)|defences]] available to him, his plea had been equivocal. The Court held:{{r|Rajeevan Edakalavan|p=19|q=paragraph 22}}

{{quote|The onus [of informing the accused of his defence options or what could be more advantageous to his case] does not shift to the judge (or the Prosecution, for that matter) simply because the accused is unrepresented. That will be placing too onerous a burden on the judge. Furthermore, the judge will be performing two completely incompatible and irreconcilable roles – one as the adjudicator, the other as the ''[[de facto]]'' defence counsel.}}

In Singapore, the right to legal representation is contingent on the nature of the inquiry. However, since [[Article 12 of the Constitution of Singapore|Article 12]] of the [[Constitution of Singapore]] guarantees equal protection under the law, it has been suggested that greater weightage should be accorded to this procedural right when balancing it against the competing demand of efficiency.{{r|Thio|p=193–4}}

====The decision and reasons for it====
Currently, the principles of natural justice in the United Kingdom and certain other jurisdictions do not include a general rule that reasons should be given for decisions.&lt;ref name=Doody/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Re Siah Mooi Guat'' [1988] 2. S.L.R.(R.) 165 at 178–179, para. 34, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''R v Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal, ex parte Shaw'' (1951),&lt;ref name="ex parte Shaw"&gt;''R v Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal, ex parte Shaw'' [1952] 1 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 338, [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]] (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Denning]] L.J. stated: "I think the record must contain at least the document which initiates the proceedings; the pleadings, if any; and the adjudication; but not the evidence, nor the reasons, unless the tribunal chooses to incorporate them. If the tribunal does state its reasons, and those reasons are wrong in law, certiorari lies to quash the decision."{{r|ex parte Shaw|p=352}} It has been stated that "no single factor has inhibited the development of English administrative law as seriously as the absence of any general obligation upon public authorities to give reasons for their decisions".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Keith Frank Goodfellow|title=Administration under Law: A Report by [[JUSTICE]] |location=London |publisher=Stevens |year=1971 |page=23 |isbn=978-0-420-43710-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, uncontrolled public decisions have led to poor outcomes and disrespect for the decision-makers. Such decisions also lacked the regularity and transparency that distinguish them from the mere say-so of public authorities. On such grounds, there are obvious benefits for the disclosure of reasons for decisions. First, procedural participation by people affected by a decision promotes the rule of law by making it more difficult for the public authority to act arbitrarily.{{r|Endicott|p=110}} Requiring the giving of reasons helps ensure that decisions are carefully thought through, which in turn aids in the control of administrative discretion.{{r|Thio|p=194}} Secondly, accountability makes it necessary for the public authority to face up to the people affected by a decision. When a public authority acts on all the relevant considerations, this increases the probability of better decision outcomes and, as such, is beneficial to public interests. Another important benefit is that respect for decision-makers is fostered, which increases their integrity in the public's eyes.{{r|Endicott|p=110}}

[[File:NoGodsNoMasters.jpg|alt=Anarchists carrying a banner|right|thumb|Anarchists marching with the 'No Gods, No Masters' slogan on a banner.]]

'''No gods, no masters''' is an [[anarchist]] and labour slogan. It has been in common use by anarchists in England since the late 19th century. The journal Commonweal, for instance, includes an article by John Creaghe from Sheffield in which he records that the Sheffield Telegraph newspaper 'was furious when it found we were Anarchists with "Neither God nor Master" for our motto' (11 July 1891, p. 76). An early 20th century usage is evident in a pamphlet handed out by the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] during the [[1912 Lawrence Textile Strike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wyatt.elasticbeanstalk.com/mep/MS/xml/mshist.html |title=mshist |publisher=Wyatt.elasticbeanstalk.com |date=1916-01-05 |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase is derived from the French slogan "''Ni dieu ni maître''!" (literally 'Neither God nor master') coined by the [[socialist]] [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]] in 1880, when he published a journal by that name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radicalreference.info/node/605 |title=Question: origin of the slogan "ni dieu ni maître" &amp;#124; Radical Reference |publisher=Radicalreference.info |date= |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=Message boards are not reliable sources.|date=April 2018}}  In [[Joseph Conrad]]'s novel ''The Secret Agent'', first published in 1907, the anarchist character The Professor says: "My device is: No God! No master." &lt;ref&gt;(Joseph Conrad, The Secret Agent, Pan Classics, 1975 edition, p.&amp;nbsp;228)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:The Woman Rebel, March 1914, Vol 1, No. 1.gif|thumb|[[Margaret Sanger]]'s feminist pamphlet used the slogan as a subtitle in 1914.]]

The French phrase appears twice in [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s 1886  work ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]''. It appears first in Section 22, in a critique of the notion that nature dictates a morality of equality before the law. It appears again in section 202 where he identifies it with the anarchists and as indicative of their "herd" mentality, which he is criticizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil|url=http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/nietzsche/beyondgoodandevil5.htm |date=February 2009 |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the inspiration behind English poet [[A.E. Housman]]'s "The laws of God, the laws of man", which was published in 1922 in his final collection, [[Last Poems]]. The poem effectively dramatises the psychological urge behind the saying, but also ends with a reflection on the impracticality criticism often levelled at anarchist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7848/7848-h/7848-h.htm#link2H_4_0012|title=The laws of god, the laws of man|date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminist usage===
In 1914, [[Margaret Sanger]] launched ''The Woman Rebel'', an eight-page monthly newsletter which promoted contraception using the slogan "No Gods, No Masters". Sanger insisted that every woman was the mistress of her own body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="No Gods, No Masters": Margaret Sanger on Birth Control|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5084/|publisher=gmu.edu|accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Women without superstition: No gods – No Masters!" by [[Annie Laurie Gaylor]] is a collection of writings by women [[Freethought|freethinkers]] during the 19th and 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8P5JAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BR4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2199,3143875&amp;dq=women-without-superstition&amp;hl=en |title=The Michigan Daily - Google News Archive |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary usage===
Today the slogan continues to find use in anarchist politics. An anthology of anarchist writing was collected under the title "No Gods, No Masters: An Anthology of Anarchism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/No_Gods_No_Masters.html?id=g4YncZ8MgRsC |title=No Gods, No Masters - Daniel Guérin - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]]|accessdate=2012-06-11|isbn=9781904859253 |last1=Gu�Rin |first1=Daniel |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slogan has also found use in musical cultures, largely associated with the [[Punk subculture|punk]] movement. But it was first used in the French [[chanson]] field, by the anarchist poet and [[singer-songwriter]] [[Léo Ferré]] who released the song ''Ni Dieu ni maître'' on an EP in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/L%C3%A9o-Ferr%C3%A9-Ni-Dieu-Ni-Ma%C3%AEtre/release/1475925|title=Léo Ferré - Ni Dieu Ni Maître|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This song, metaphorically depicting the French [[death penalty]] procedure, ends with these verses: "This slogan that breaks all the rules / Made for the benefit of fools / Rejecting all authority / Unless respecting liberty / This principle of human rights / I recommend it for your fights / We shall proclaim it to the last / No God no master!".

The slogan was also chosen as a song title by the English crust punk/heavy metal band [[Amebix]] on their EP ''[[Who's the Enemy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMEBIX- Who's the Enemy 7"EP (Spiderleg Records, UK, 1982)|url=http://www.goodbadmusic.com/2007/06/17/amebix-whos-the-enemy-7ep-spiderleg-records-uk-1982/|publisher=goodbadmusic.com|accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish death metal band [[Arch Enemy]] on their album ''[[Khaos Legions]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arch Enemy official site|url=http://archenemy.net/2011/index.php?go=music|publisher=Arch Enemy|accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Khaos Legions review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/khaos-legions-mw0002143136|publisher=allmusic.com|accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Luxembourgish neofolk/martial band [[Rome (band)|Rome]] on their album ''Confessions D'Un Voleur D'Ames''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Rome-Confessions-DUn-Voleur-DAmes/master/314074|title=Rome (4) - Confessions D'Un Voleur D'Ames|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2017-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;'','' and Chicago-based hardcore band [[Harm's Way (band)|Harm's Way]], who released an EP entitled 'No Gods, No Masters' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.closedcasketactivities.com/site/releases/cca017/|title=Closed Casket Activities " Harm's Way – No Gods No Masters|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan is used as the main chorus in the song Religious Cancer by [[Nailbomb]] on their album [[Point Blank (Nailbomb album)|Point Blank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/music/preview/Twx4speo6fncejziytqa2tmq6wm?lyrics=1&amp;pcampaignid=kp-lyrics|title=Religious Cancer Lyrics at Google Play Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Canadian female punk band [[Pantychrist]] released their song "No Gods No Masters"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pantychrist Bandcamp|url=https://pantychrist.bandcamp.com/track/no-gods-no-masters|publisher=Pantychrist|accessdate=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014 with lyrics espousing the pro-feminist usage of the phrase that was used as the byline of the 1914 [[Margaret_Sanger|Margaret Sanger]] newsletter The Woman Rebel.  The newsletter promoted contraception and insisted that every woman was the mistress of her own body&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8P5JAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BR4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2199,3143875&amp;dq=women-without-superstition&amp;hl=en |title=The Michigan Daily - Google News Archive |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The slogan was rephrased as ''[[No Gods, No Managers]]'', as an album title by American crust punk band [[Choking Victim]].&lt;ref name="amazon1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.ca/No-Gods-Managers-Choking-Victim/dp/B000028DFU |title=No Gods/No Managers: Choking Victim: Amazon.ca: Music |publisher=Amazon.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Anarchism and religion|religious anarchists]], who combine neopagan religiosity and anarchist ideas, use a modified version: "Many Gods, No masters".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10424">In [[genetics]], a '''non-paternity event'''  is when someone who is presumed to be an individual's father is not in fact the biological father. This presumption may be on the part of the individual, the parents, or the physician. Non-paternity may result from [[sperm donation]], undisclosed adoption, intercourse with multiple partners in close succession, non-consensual sex, as well as medical mistakes, for example, mixups during procedures such as [[in vitro fertilization]] and [[artificial insemination]].&lt;ref name=2005bellis&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bellis MA, Hughes K, Hughes S, Ashton JR |title=Measuring paternal discrepancy and its public health consequences |journal=J Epidemiol Community Health |volume=59 |issue=9 |pages=749–54 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16100312 |pmc=1733152 |doi=10.1136/jech.2005.036517 |url=http://jech.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16100312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where there is uncertainty, the most reliable technique for establishing paternity is [[genetic testing]]; however, there is still a risk of error due to the potential for [[gene mutation]]s or scoring errors.

Overall, the incidence of misattributed paternity ranges from about 2% to 12%, though it may be higher in certain populations. The discovery of previously unsuspected or undisclosed non-paternity may have both social and medical consequences. Non-paternity that is due to a previously undisclosed extra-marital relationship often has serious consequences for a marital relationship. Non-paternity is medically relevant when interpreting the results and utility of genetic screening for [[hereditary]] illnesses.

==Definitions and uses==
Bellis et al. (2005) stated that misattributed paternity "occurs when a child is believed to have been fathered by the husband (or partner) but is actually the progeny of another man."&lt;ref name=2005bellis/&gt; Non-paternity events are also sometimes referred to as misattributed paternity, paternal discrepancy or false paternity.&lt;!----&gt; Although it is sometimes referred to as [[paternity fraud]], this suggests that the misattribution was deliberate rather than accidental.&lt;ref name=2005draper&gt;{{cite journal |last= Draper |first= Heather |year= 2005 |title= Paternity fraud and compensation for misattributed paternity |journal= Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=33 |issue= 8 |pages= 475–480 |doi= 10.1136/jme.2005.013268 |pmid= 17664309 |pmc= 2598159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a scientific review of non-paternity studies since the 1950s, Bellis et al. (2005) stated that knowingly covering up an accidental pregnancy that resulted from infidelity is often assumed to be the reason for non-paternity, but that there are many other reasons, "for example, where sex with the long term partner has not produced children a woman might seek conception elsewhere." They said other reasons might be undisclosed adoptions, accidental misattribution resulting from multiple relationships in close succession as well as medical mistakes, such as mixups during procedures such as [[in vitro fertilization]] and [[artificial insemination]].&lt;ref name=2005bellis/&gt;

In [[genetic genealogy]] the term non-paternity is often used in a wider context to indicate a break in the link between the [[Y-chromosome]] and the surname. Such a breakage may occur because of formal or informal adoption, premarital or extramarital intercourse or rape, or when individuals use a different surname than their biological father, such as their mother's maiden name, a stepfather's name, the use of aliases or a legal name change.&lt;ref name=2006bopp&gt;{{citation|last=Bopp|first=Georgia K.|title=Non-Paternal Event (NPE)|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~gkbopp/DNA/falsepaternal.htm|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing for non-paternity==
{{further information|DNA paternity testing}}
The most reliable test for paternity is [[genetic testing]], sometimes referred to as [[DNA]] testing. Requirements for consent and counselling vary by country.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} However, genetic testing is based on probabilities and is not always definitive. Jones et al. (2010) said, "Characteristics of the markers and the fact that they are analysed by fallible humans can result in inconsistencies that present problems for parentage analysis." False negatives may occur due to low quality samples, [[gene mutation]]s, or [[genotyping]] errors (when a [[genotype]] is misread or inaccurately scored). There is a higher probability of accuracy when DNA from both parents can be tested. The accuracy increases even more when DNA from a sibling is available.&lt;ref name=2010jones&gt;{{citation|last=Jones|title=A practical guide to methods of parentage analysis|url=https://web.natur.cuni.cz/~muncling/Jones%202010%20paternity.pdf|journal=Molecular Ecology Resources|year=2010|volume=10|issue=1|pages=6–30|doi=10.1111/j.1755-0998.2009.02778.x|pmid=21564987|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rates of non-paternity==

===Typical births===
It is difficult to accurately estimate the incidence of misattributed paternity, and there have been large discrepancies in the research published on the topic. Often data on non-paternity rates are reported tangentially to the primary goal of research without sufficient detail, and very few studies involve randomized samples. As such, it is not possible to make valid generalizations based on a large portion of the available literature.&lt;ref name=1991macintyre&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Macintyre S, Sooman A|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Non-paternity and prenatal genetic screening|journal=Lancet|year=1991|volume=338|issue=8771|pmid=1681226|pages=869–871|doi=10.1016/0140-6736(91)91513-T}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellis et al. (2005) found that between 1950 and 2004, the rates of misattributed paternity published in scientific journals ranged from 0.8% to 30% with a median of 3.7%.&lt;ref name=2005bellis/&gt; According to a study published in the ''Lancet'', "High rates have been quoted, but are often unsupported by any published evidence or based on unrepresentative population samples."&lt;ref name=1991macintyre/&gt;

[[Turi King]] and Mark Jobling of the Department of Genetics at [[University of Leicester]] called the commonly cited 30% rate of non-paternity an "urban myth".&lt;ref name=2009rincon&gt;{{cite news|author=Rincon P|title=Study debunks illegitimacy 'myth'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7881652.stm|work=BBC News|date=11 February 2009|accessdate=11 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to King and Jobling, the figure is around 2%. They also stated that misattributed paternity is often impacted by cultural and socioeconomic factors and that it occurs more frequently among couples who aren't married.&lt;ref name=2009king&gt;{{citation|last1=King|first1=Turi E.|last2=Jobling|first2=Mark A.|title=Founders, Drift, and Infidelity: The Relationship between Y Chromosome Diversity and Patrilineal Surnames|pmc=2668828|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|volume=26|issue=5|year=2009|pmid=19204044|doi=10.1093/molbev/msp022|pages=1093–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Michael Gilding concluded that inflated figures have been circulated by the media, the [[Parental test|paternity testing]] industry,  [[fathers' rights movement|fathers' rights activists]] and [[evolutionary psychologist]]s.&lt;ref name=2009gilding&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gilding |first1= Michael |year= 2005 |title= Rampant misattributed paternity: the creation of an urban myth |journal= People and Place |volume= 13 |issue= 12 |pages= 1&amp;ndash;11 |publisher= [[Monash University]] |doi= |url= http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/480786 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2009bgilding&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gilding | first1 = M. | doi = 10.1177/0038038508099102 | title = Paternity Uncertainty and Evolutionary Psychology: How a Seemingly Capricious Occurrence Fails to Follow Laws of Greater Generality | journal = Sociology | volume = 43 | pages = 140–691 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He traced many of these overestimates back to a 1972 conference where non-paternity rates as high as 30% were discussed.&lt;ref name=1973philipp&gt;Philipp EE (1973) "Discussion: moral, social and ethical issues". In: Wolstenholme GEW, Fitzsimons DW, eds. ''Law and ethics of AID and embryo transfer''. Ciba Foundation symposium. Vol 17. London: Associated Scientific 63–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilding states that these data only show the incidence of non-paternity in cases where disputed parentage was the ''reason'' for paternity testing. &lt;ref name=2005bellis/&gt;&lt;ref name=2011gilding&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilding|first=Michael|title=The fatherhood myth: Michael Gilding unravels the uncertain data about mistaken paternity|date=26 July 2011|url=http://inside.org.au/the-fatherhood-myth/|publisher=The inside story|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In situations where disputed parentage was the reason for the paternity testing, there were higher levels with an incidence of 17% to 33% (median of 26.9%). Most at risk of parental discrepancy were those born to younger parents, to unmarried couples and those of lower socio-economic status, or from certain ethnic and cultural groups.&lt;ref name=2005bellis/&gt;

===Atypical multiple births===
{{main|heteropaternal superfecundation}}
Rarely, genetic testing has revealed children from [[multiple birth]]s to have different fathers, which is known as "[[heteropaternal superfecundation]]". One study estimated that the incidence of bipaternal twins born to white women in the United States is around one pair in 400.&lt;ref name=1993james&gt;{{citation|last=James|first=WH|title=The incidence of superfecundation and of double paternity in the general population|pmid=7871943|journal=Acta geneticae medicae et gemellologiae|year=1993|volume=42|issue=3–4|pages=257–62|doi=10.1017/s0001566000003263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found the prevalence to be approximately one pair in 13,000 cases.&lt;ref name=2015garcia&gt;{{citation|last=Garcia|title=Heteropaternal superfecundation: Implicancies in forensic genetics|url=http://www.fsigeneticssup.com/article/S1875-1768(15)30173-6/abstract|journal=Forensic Science International: Genetics Supplement Series|year=2015|volume=5|page=e633|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.fsigss.2015.10.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to evolution:
[[File:CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg|thumb|400px|right|A diagram showing the relationships betweens various groups of organisms]]
'''[[Evolution]]''' – change in [[heritable trait]]s of [[Organisms|biological organisms]] over generations due to [[natural selection]], [[mutation]], [[gene flow]], and [[genetic drift]].  Also known as '''descent with modification'''. Over time these evolutionary processes lead to formation of new species ([[speciation]]), changes within lineages ([[anagenesis]]), and loss of species ([[extinction]]). "Evolution" is also another name for [[evolutionary biology]], the subfield of [[biology]] concerned with studying [[Evolution|evolutionary processes]] that produced the [[diversity of life]] on Earth.

==Background==
On 20 October 2017, an anonymous [[Reddit]] user hinted at the existence of the Paradise Papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Truong|first=Alice|url=https://qz.com/1120925/paradise-papers-reddit-user-hinted-at-data-leak-16-days-before-news-broke|title=A Reddit user hinted at Paradise Papers 16 days before they leaked|date=6 November 2017|work=Quartz|accessdate=6 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106105209/https://qz.com/1120925/paradise-papers-reddit-user-hinted-at-data-leak-16-days-before-news-broke|archivedate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] (ICIJ) approached the [[Offshore financial centre|offshore]] law firm [[Appleby (law firm)|Appleby]] with allegations of wrongdoing. Appleby said that some of its data had been stolen in a [[cyberattack]] the previous year, and denied the ICIJ's allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hodgson|first=Camilla |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/financial-secrets-of-super-rich-stolen-offshore-appleby-2017-10|title=Panama Papers 2?

Appleby stated the firm "was not the subject of a leak but of a serious criminal act" and that "this was an illegal computer hack". "Our systems were accessed by an intruder who deployed the tactics of a professional hacker", the company said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.applebyglobal.com/media-statements/appleby-reaction-to-media-coverage.aspx|title=Appleby reaction to media coverage|publisher=Appleby|date=5 November 2017|accessdate=8 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107153505/https://www.applebyglobal.com/media-statements/appleby-reaction-to-media-coverage.aspx|archivedate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2017/11/07/data-leak-was-criminal-act|title=Data leak was 'criminal act' |work=Jersey Evening Post|date=7 November 2017|accessdate=10 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111042447/https://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2017/11/07/data-leak-was-criminal-act|archivedate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documents were acquired by the German newspaper ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', which had also obtained the [[Panama Papers]] in 2016. According to the [[BBC]], the name "Paradise Papers" reflects "the idyllic profiles of many of the offshore jurisdictions whose workings are unveiled", so-called [[tax haven]]s, or "tax paradises".&lt;ref name="BBC need to know" /&gt;

The data breach comprises some 13.4&amp;nbsp;million documents—totaling about 1.4 terabytes—from two offshore service providers, Appleby and [[Asiaciti Trust]], and from the company registers of 19 tax havens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paradise Papers|url=https://projekte.sueddeutsche.de/paradisepapers/wirtschaft/answers-to-pressing-questions-about-the-leak-e574659|work=Süddeutsche Zeitung|access-date=6 November 2017|date=5 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106132311/https://projekte.sueddeutsche.de/paradisepapers/wirtschaft/answers-to-pressing-questions-about-the-leak-e574659|archivedate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'' journalists contacted the ICIJ, which has been investigating the documents with 100 media partners.

===Apple===
{{main|Leprechaun economics}}
A great deal of the company's [[intangible property]] was exposed around the time of an internal [[Apple Inc.]] reorganization of three [[Ireland|Irish]] subsidiaries. The company's 2015 [[gross domestic product]] showed a 26% increase, and close to $270&amp;nbsp;billion of [[intangible asset]]s suddenly appeared in Ireland as the year began – more than the entire value of all residential property in Ireland. This may indicate that Apple took advantage of a tax incentive known as a capital allowance, which gives Irish companies generous tax breaks for buying intangible property – essentially intellectual property like patents. In other words, Apple (some suggest) transferred them to a subsidiary located in Ireland for the tax incentives, and didn't have to pay any tax on the transaction in Bermuda either, on the value it declared on the property when it sold them to itself.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Following a 2013 US Senate investigation, which featured testimony by CEO [[Tim Cook]], Ireland announced that henceforth Irish companies would be required to declare [[tax residency]] somewhere in the world. Apple had been paying a lower rate of corporate taxes in Ireland in a so-called sweetheart deal. This attracted the attention of EU regulators as many multinationals were doing the same thing. As the tax break in the Netherlands came to a scheduled end, Apple's law firm, Baker McKenzie, researched island tax havens, asking Appleby officials in numerous jurisdictions to confirm "that an Irish company can conduct management activities ... without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction." Two of the subsidiaries moved to [[Jersey]] and took intellectual property with them{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. The third is receiving tax breaks in Ireland for buying Apple IP from another Apple subsidiary{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}.

The Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC) issued a Statement re Apple on 7 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jerseyfsc.org/media/1596/2017-11-07_jfsc_statement_re_apple.pdf|title=Jersey Financial Services Commission Statement re Apple|publisher=JFSC|date=7 November 2017|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JFSC confirmed that the two Apple subsidiaries referred to by the media are not Jersey-registered companies and their understanding is that Apple funds relating to these entities have not been remitted to or held in the Island.

The JFSC states that it has not seen any of the documentation that the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) claims to hold following the Appleby data breach. If the ICIJ possesses data of a criminal or regulatory nature which relates to business activities in Jersey then the JFSC requested that this information is shared with them and, if there is any evidence of regulatory wrongdoing, then they would investigate and take action if appropriate.

The Government of Jersey (States of Jersey) also issued a statement of similar effect on 7 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.je/News/2017/Pages/ApplebyStatement.aspx|title=Jersey Government Appleby Data Breach Statement|publisher=States of Jersey|date=7 November 2017|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is of further note that the jurisdiction of Jersey has recently been independently assessed as fully compliant with international regulatory guidelines on tax transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/countries/jersey/global-forum-on-transparency-and-exchange-of-information-for-tax-purposes-jersey-2017-second-round-9789264283824-en.htm|title=OECD Jersey Report 2017|publisher=OECD|date=17 November 2017|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU, under the leadership of [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], threatened to sue Ireland over its tax deals, although Juncker himself had approved similar tax deals in his own country, [[Luxembourg]]. Apple paid all of its taxes in Ireland as required by that country so Ireland is appealing the EU decision. HP, Nike, Microsoft and others use the same tax arrangements in Ireland, Luxembourg and other countries,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} but Apple is frequently cited as a media example.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of public corporations by market capitalization#2017]]&lt;/ref&gt; Irish companies are required to pay taxes in Ireland, but if they convince authorities {{Which|date=February 2018}} that they are "managed and controlled" from abroad, the companies may win an exemption.

Apple now holds $252&amp;nbsp;billion offshore.&lt;ref name=Apple&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers|title=Apple's Offshore Island Hop|author=Simon Bowers|date=6 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|publisher=ICIJ|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105235747/https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/|archivedate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Apple has previously publicly stated that it reinvests post-tax earnings (generated outside the US) into the global economy via investment funds held offshore.

=== Avianca ===
[[Germán Efromovich]], founder of [[Synergy Group]], is linked to an offshore conglomerate used for the aerocommercial [[holding business]] with ramifications in Bermuda, Panama, and Cyprus. Efromovich used a Panamanian offshore that hid more than 20 firms located in tax havens. The conglomerate was used by Synergy Group's subsidiary [[Avianca Holdings]] in the purchase of MacAir Jet, now [[Avianca Argentina]], aircraft company owned by Macri Group, for an amount of $10&amp;nbsp;million. Allowing Avianca to make headway in the [[low-cost carrier]] business in Argentina. The Argentine government accepted this offshores as a financial [[guarantee]] to assign air routes to Avianca. The whole operation of assigning air routes is investigated by the Argentine federal justice system in a case called "Avianca" in which the [[President of Argentina]] [[Mauricio Macri]] and other officials were imputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=10 November 2017|last1=Delfino|first1=Emilia|last2=Crucianelli|first2=Sandra|last3=Fitz Patrick|first3=Mariel|last4=Brom|first4=Ricardo|last5=Jastreblansky|first5=Maia|last6=Ruiz|first6=Iván|last7=Alconada Mon|first7=Hugo|title=Paradise Papers – El entramado de más de 20 offshores detrás del desembarco de Avianca|url=http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/paradise-papers-el-entramado-de-mas-de-20-offshores-detras-del-desembarco-de-avianca.phtml|accessdate=10 November 2017|work=[[Perfil]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110143321/http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/paradise-papers-el-entramado-de-mas-de-20-offshores-detras-del-desembarco-de-avianca.phtml|archivedate=10 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DST Global ===
A [[Kremlin-owned firm]], [[VTB Bank]], put $191&amp;nbsp;million into DST Global, an investment firm part of [[Mail.ru]] Group and founded by Russian billionaire [[Yuri Milner]], which used it to buy a large share of [[Twitter]] in 2011. A subsidiary of the Kremlin-controlled [[Gazprom]] funded an investment company that partnered with DST Global to buy shares in [[Facebook]], reaping millions when the social media giant went public in 2012. Twitter similarly went public in 2013. The US government sanctioned VTB in 2014 because of the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russian military intervention in Crimea]], but DST Global had by then sold its stake in Twitter. Four days after the Facebook [[IPO]], a DST Global subsidiary sold more than 27&amp;nbsp;million shares of Facebook for approximately $1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=FBTwit&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/kremlin-owned-firms-linked-major-twitter-facebook-investments-icij/|title=Kremlin-Owned Firms Linked To Major Investments In Twitter And Facebook: The Russian government quietly held a financial interest in U.S. social media|author=Spencer Woodman|date=5 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|publisher=ICIJ|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106011238/https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/kremlin-owned-firms-linked-major-twitter-facebook-investments-icij/|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Glencore]], an Anglo–Swiss multinational commodity trading and mining company, loaned $45&amp;nbsp;million to Israeli billionaire [[Dan Gertler]] in exchange for his help with officials of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] in negotiations over a [[joint venture]] with state-owned [[Gécamines]] at the [[Katanga Mining|Katanga copper mine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gertler, Dan (DGI Group): Rough and Polished: Information and Analytics on Diamond and Jewellery Markets|date=3 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ben Doherty|author2=Oliver Zihlmann|publisher=Guardian|date=5 November 2017|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/05/the-inside-story-of-glencore-hidden-dealings-in-drc|title=The inside story of Glencore's hidden dealings in the DRC|accessdate=8 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106060148/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/05/the-inside-story-of-glencore-hidden-dealings-in-drc|archivedate=6 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current DRC president, [[Joseph Kabila]], the son of [[Laurent Kabila]], who sold Congolese diamond rights to Gertler, then used the proceeds to take power in a ''[[coup d'état|coup]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

One of the Katanga board members was Glencore major shareholder [[Telis Mistakidis]], a former employee whose [[stock options]] made him a billionaire in the IPO. Glencore, which had effectively taken over Katanga, agreed to vote for the joint venture. The loan document specifically provided that repayment would be owed if agreement was not reached within three months. Gertler and Glencore each have denied wrongdoing. Appleby had worked for Glencore and its founder [[Marc Rich]] on major projects in the past, even after his indictment in 1983.&lt;ref name=glencore&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Guardian|title=Revealed: Glencore's secret loan to secure DRC mining rights|author1=Ben Doherty|author2=Oliver Zihlmann|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/05/revealed-glencore-secret-loan-drc-mining-rights-paradise-papers|date=5 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106023739/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/05/revealed-glencore-secret-loan-drc-mining-rights-paradise-papers|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=room&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/room-of-secrets-reveals-mysteries-of-glencore/|author1=Bastian Obermayer|author2=Edouard Perrin|author3=Frederik Obermaier|author4=Oliver Zihlmann|author5=Petra Blum|author6=Will Fitzgibbon|date=5 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|title=Room Of Secrets Reveals Glencore's Mysteries: Law firm's internal files reveal oil, mineral and grain trader Glencore signed secret deals and loaned millions to a high-risk business partner.|publisher=ICIJ|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106000453/https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/room-of-secrets-reveals-mysteries-of-glencore/|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rich was indicted in the United States on federal charges of [[tax evasion]] and making controversial oil deals with Iran during the [[Iran hostage crisis]].&lt;ref name="KingofOil"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Daniel Ammann|Ammann, Daniel]]|title=[[The King of Oil: The Secret Lives of Marc Rich]]|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|location=New York|year=2009|isbn=0-312-57074-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Bill Clinton pardon controversy|controversial presidential pardon]] from [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] on 20 January 2001, Clinton's last day in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/may/13/features.magazine37 |title=Profile: Marc Rich &amp;#124; From the Observer &amp;#124; The Observer |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|GMG]] |location=London |issn=0261-3077 |oclc=60623878 |accessdate=30 October 2012 |first=Mark |last=Honigsbaum |date=13 May 2001 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204000206/http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/may/13/features.magazine37 |archivedate=4 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A separate ICIJ project found that tax auditors in [[Burkina Faso]] accused a Glencore subsidiary of deducting from its taxes "fictitious" payments to other Glencore subsidiaries, and of selling the zinc from its mine (to another Glencore compary) in unrefined form to minimize its revenue, which it publicly said in 2015 had not recovered from a 2017 downturn. Its CEO told shareholders before this that it expected a spike in demand, which did materialize. The mine is owned by Nantou Mining SA, which is owned by Merope Inc, a Bermuda shell company set up by Appleby with directors provided by the firm. Glencore sold Merope in April 2017 but before that it was 100% owned by Glencore Finance (Bermuda) Ltd, which was, according to a document from the Paradise Papers leaks, 100% owned by Glencore Group Funding Ltd of the [[United Arab Emirates]], an entity in turn 100% owned by Swiss firm Glencore International AG, itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Glencore plc, registered in [[Jersey]].&lt;ref name=Burk&gt;{{ cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/development-dreams-stand-still-mining-money-moves-offshore/|title=Development Dreams Stand Still While Mining Money Moves Offshore|author=Will Fitzgibbon|date=8 November 2017|accessdate=12 November 2017|publisher=ICIJ|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110061248/https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/development-dreams-stand-still-mining-money-moves-offshore/|archivedate=10 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents were also discovered discussing Glencore's desire to keep its substantial stake in SwissMarine a secret, and that although the subsidiary's annual report showed [[revenues]] of $1.9 billion in 2014, Glencore does not mention it in its disclosures to the [[London Stock Exchange]] or any other public filing because, it said, it did not consider this a significant investment.&lt;ref name=Swiss&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icij.org//paradise-papers/glencores-hush-hush-swissmarine-fleet/|title=The Ships Glencore Wanted To Keep 'Hush Hush'|publisher=ICIJ|date=9 November 2017|accessdate=12 November 2017|author=Will Fitzgibbon}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian branch of Glencore has been demonstrated to have carried out some $25&amp;nbsp;billion in [[Interest rate swap|cross-currency interest rate swaps]], complex financial instruments the [[Australian Taxation Office]] suspects of being used to avoid paying taxes in Australia.&lt;ref name=GlencoreATO&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/05/glencore-australian-arm-moved-billions-through-bermuda|title=Glencore's Australian Arm moved Billions Through Bermuda: Paradise Papers reveal use of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which are under investigation by the tax office|author=Ben Doherty|publisher=The Guardian|date=5 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106024102/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/05/glencore-australian-arm-moved-billions-through-bermuda|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nike ===
Appleby documents detail how Nike boosted its after-tax profits by, among other maneuvers, transferring ownership of its Swoosh [[trademark]] to a Bermudian subsidiary, Nike International Ltd. This transfer allowed the [[subsidiary]] to charge [[royalties]] to its European headquarters in [[Hilversum]], [[Netherlands]], effectively converting taxable company [[profit (accounting)|profits]] to an account payable in tax-free Bermuda.&lt;ref name=Nike&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/explore-politicians-paradise-papers/|title=How NikeStays One Step Ahead of the Regulators: When One Tax Loophole Closes, Another Opens|author=Simon Bowers|publisher=ICIJ|date=6 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106011937/https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/explore-politicians-paradise-papers/|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the subsidiary was effectively run by executives at Nike's main offices in [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], Oregon – to the point where a duplicate of the Bermudian company's seal was needed – for tax purposes the subsidiary was treated as based in Bermuda. Its profits were not declared in Europe and came to light only because of a mostly unrelated case in [[US Tax Court]], where papers filed by Nike briefly mention royalties in 2010, 2011 and 2012 totaling $3.86&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=Nike /&gt; Under an arrangement with Dutch authorities, the tax break was to expire in 2014, so another reorganization transferred the intellectual property from the Bermudian company to a Dutch ''commanditaire vennootschap'' or limited partnership, Nike Innovate CV.

Dutch law treats income earned by a CV as if it had been earned by the principals, who owe no tax in the Netherlands if they do not reside there. One in six dollars of foreign [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] earned by US multinationals was earned, at least on paper, through a Dutch CV subsidiary. Companies with similar structures include [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]], [[NetApp]] and [[Uber (company)|Uber]].&lt;ref name=Nike /&gt;

=== Odebrecht ===
Appleby managed 17 offshore companies for [[Odebrecht]], a Brazilian conglomerate, and at least one of them was used as a vehicle for paying bribes in the [[Operation Car Wash]]. Some of these offshore companies are publicly known to operate for Odebrecht in Africa and be involved in bribes. Among those involved in the operation who also are named in the papers are [[Marcelo Odebrecht]], Brazilian businessman and former Odebrecht' CEO, his father Emílio Odebrecht and his brother Maurício Odebrecht.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Delfino|first1=Emilia|title=Paradise Papers: Salen a la luz 17 offshore de Odebrecht y al menos una se usó para sobornos|url=http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/paradise-papers-salen-a-la-luz-17-offshore-de-odebrecht-y-al-menos-una-se-uso-para-sobornos.phtml|accessdate=9 November 2017|work=[[Perfil]]|date=8 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108203827/http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/paradise-papers-salen-a-la-luz-17-offshore-de-odebrecht-y-al-menos-una-se-uso-para-sobornos.phtml|archivedate=8 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PokerStars ===
Appleby and various banks in the [[Isle of Man]], including [[Conister Bank]] which is owned by [[Arron Banks]] and [[Jim Mellon]], had business with [[PokerStars]] and its founders, [[Mark Scheinberg]] and his father [[Isai Scheinberg]], until it was sold for $4.9&amp;nbsp;billion in 2014 to [[The Stars Group]], formerly known as Amaya. PokerStars and its founders [[United States v.

After the leak, more than 30 [[Members of the European Parliament]] issued an open letter criticizing the British government for failing to take action against the offshore tax industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Osborne|first1=Hilary|last2=MacAskill|first2=Ewen|title=Britain criticised by MEPs for failing to take action on tax havens|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/10/britain-criticised-meps-action-tax-havens-paradise-papers|accessdate=10 November 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110143004/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/10/britain-criticised-meps-action-tax-havens-paradise-papers|archivedate=10 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gavin St Pier]], an elected Deputy of the tax haven [[Guernsey]], stated that the "coverage was part of a well-orchestrated, ongoing campaign".&lt;ref name=GStP&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/38e99534-c48e-11e7-a1d2-6786f39ef675 |title=Paradise Papers shake Britain's offshore tax havens |publisher=''Financial Times'' |author=Vanessa Houlder |date=8 November 2017 |accessdate=8 November 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109172213/https://www.ft.com/content/38e99534-c48e-11e7-a1d2-6786f39ef675 |archivedate=9 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also averred that despite having the information since 2016, the timing of the release was deliberately delayed to coincide with the meeting of EU Finance Ministers ahead of the proposed discussion of a tax haven blacklist.&lt;ref name=GStP /&gt;

Commenting on the Paradise Papers leak, United States Senator and 2016 presidential candidate [[Bernie Sanders]] warned of "rapid movement toward international oligarchy", saying, "The Paradise Papers shows how these billionaires and multinational corporations get richer by hiding their wealth and profits and avoid paying their fair share of taxes."&lt;ref name=Sanders&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/06/bernie-sanders-paradise-papers-leak-international-oligarchy|title=Bernie Sanders warns of 'international oligarchy' after Paradise Papers leak|publisher=''The Guardian''|accessdate=6 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106190738/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/06/bernie-sanders-paradise-papers-leak-international-oligarchy|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] leader in the US Senate, [[Chuck Schumer]], and the ranking Democratic member of the Senate finance committee, [[Ron Wyden]], issued a joint statement accusing Republicans of "pushing a reform of the tax code that fails to close egregious loopholes revealed by the leaks."&lt;ref name=Sanders /&gt;

==Litigation==
On 18 December 2017 it was reported that Appleby had issued legal proceedings against the BBC and ''The Guardian'' for [[Breach of confidence in English law|breach of confidence]].  The BBC and ''The Guardian'' said they would "vigorously" defend the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42403700|title=BBC and Guardian sued over Paradise Papers leaks|publisher=BBC News|date=18 December 2017|accessdate=24 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171221174814/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42403700|archivedate=21 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, Swiss-based multinational [[Glencore]] lodged a writ with the Australian High Court to prevent the use of Paradise Papers documents by the Australian Taxation Office in any legal action against the miner. Glencore asserted that the documents in question are subject to legal professional privilege. Glencore’s writ has four plaintiffs: Glencore International AG (an intermediate holding company resident in Switzerland), Glencore Investment Pty Ltd (a company incorporated in Australia), Glencore Australia Holdings Pty Ltd (a company incorporated in Australia) and Glencore Investment Holdings Australia Ltd (a company incorporated in Bermuda).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-gb/finance/news/glencore-seeks-injunction-against-tax-commissioner-to-prevent-use-of-paradise-papers/ar-BBNRXEJ|title=Glencore seeks injunction against tax commissioner to prevent use of Paradise Papers|publisher=The Guardian|date=4 October 2018|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2699">The term '''peace ecology''' has been used by Christos Kyrou of [[American University]] to describe a proposed theoretical framework that is intended to provide "''a better understanding, of the inherent capacities of the environment to inform and sustain peace.''"&lt;ref name=ISA&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of the term==
Peace ecology was introduced by Professor Christos Kyrou, of [[American University]] first in an article at the annual meeting of the [[International Studies Association]], in [[San Diego]], [[California]], Mar 22, 2006.&lt;ref name=ISA /&gt; It was later published in its completed form in an article with the title Peace Ecology: An Emerging Paradigm In Peace Studies in The International Journal of Peace Studies, Volume 12 #1, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

With a follow up article submitted for the Conference on Cutting Edge Theories and Recent Developments in Conflict Resolution, September 27 and 28, 2007, at Syracuse, NY, Dr. Kyrou examined various methodological perspectives from Peace Ecology.&lt;ref&gt;

Dr. Kyrou, together with his graduate and undergraduate students at the International Peace &amp; Conflict Resolution Division of the School of International Service at The American University in [[Washington DC]] continue their effort to expand the practical and theoretical potential of Peace Ecology.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10565">A '''peace walk''' or '''peace march''', sometimes referred to as a '''peace pilgrimage''',  is a form of [[nonviolent]] action where a person or groups of people march a set distance to raise awareness of particular issues important to the walkers.

==Europe==
Europe is launching its first permanent Peace Walk Route, that will run along the former division between East and West Europe and end in Trieste, N-E Italy. A pan European network is currently working on its Design, and it is set to open in 2014, to mark the 100th anniversary of World War I.

==India==
One famous example was that of [[Vinoba Bhave]], who undertook a peace walk with many of his followers throughout India for land reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fifties Spiritual Marketplace: American Religion in a Decade of Conflict|first=Robert S. |last=Ellwood|publisher=Rutgers University Press|ISBN=0-8135-2346-X|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent peace walk campaign named ''[[Freedom Walk]]'' was organized by the Free Software Community in [[Kerala]] in 2008. 4 volunteers walked 750 miles (1,200 km) from one end of the state to the other to promote [[Free Software]].&lt;ref name="fw-fsf"&gt;[http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/freedom-walk Freedom Walk], covered under community events in FSF Blogs.&lt;/ref&gt;

A peace walk was undertaken in 1962 by [[Satish Kumar]] and his companion who walked without money from India via the [[Soviet Union]], France and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] to the United States (using [[ship]]s to cross the channel and Atlantic). Vinoba gave 2 gifts to Satish and his companion: pennilessness, i.e. [[voluntary poverty]], and [[vegetarianism]].

==UK==
Early in 1984, [[peace camp]]ers walked 26 miles from [[Daws hill]] to [[Naphill]] through country roads and countryside to raise money for ''[[The Angry Pacifist]]'' magazine.

[[File:San Diego Peace March 2003.jpg|thumb|About 7,000 San Diego Peace Marchers in Balboa Park Protest the Iraq War, March 15, 2003]]The ''[[King-Carter Freedom Peace Walk]]'' is a 1.5-mile walkway in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]'s (USA) Freedom Park. It commemorates the only two Georgia winners of the [[Nobel Prize]] for Peace: [[Martin Luther King Jr]]. and [[Jimmy Carter]].

Various peace organizations throughout the United States have organized marches and vigils to protest the [[Iraq War]], since before the war started in 2003, and then annually ever since.  Sometimes these marches are coordinated to take place on the same day across the nation. In San Diego, the greatest number of anti-war protesters, an estimated 7,000, turned out for a demonstration on March 15, just five days before the beginning of the Iraq War.

===The Interfaith Pilgrimage for Peace and Life===
"The Interfaith Pilgrimage for Peace and Life" started in Auschwitz, Poland on December 8, 1994, and ended in Nagasaki on the fiftieth anniversary of the Nagasaki bombing, 9 August 1995. It was led by [[Nipponzan-Myōhōji]] Japanese Buddhist monks. The monks, however, were dwarfed in number by American, European, South American and Japanese lay people.

The trip was organized to both commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II as well as to be witness to the suffering in contemporary war zones. The group walked from Auschwitz to Vienna, then travelled through Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia. They crossed the front lines of the Bosnian war in Mostar and held a day of vigil, fasting and prayer there. The next leg took them through Israel, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Jordan and Iraq.

The group travelled across the front lines in Cambodia, where they joined the [[Dhammayietra]], an annual Cambodian peace walk led by "the Gandhi of Cambodia" [[Maha Ghosananda]]. They then visited war sites in Vietnam and the Philippines before going to Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

This walk was one of many peace pilgrimages organized by the Nipponzan Myōhōji monks, but it was the largest in scale, number of participants, time, and distance travelled.

Over 1000 people participated in at least part of the pilgrimage, including Buddhists, [[Quaker]]s, [[Catholic]]s, [[Muslim]]s and [[Jew]]s. The pilgrimage received media attention and books were written about it.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===A Walk to Moscow===
[[File:Donna,_(Spirit),_Bradley_and_her_son_on_A_Walk_for_Survival,_Oregon_Coast,_April_22,_1980.jpeg|thumb|right|Donna Bradley and her son on A Walk For Survival, Oregon Coast, April 22, 1980]]
"A Walk to Moscow" was a peace walk, one of many walks for peace in the 20th century. These were specially organized by groups of [[pacifists]] and [[List_of_peace_activists|peace activists]] who wanted to make some protest against the politics of war and the use of chemical, biological and [[nuclear weapons]]. In the early 1960s, there was a walk across the United States, [[Europe]] and the [[USSR]] (its history is told in a book ''You Come with Naked Hands'' by [[Bradford Lyttle]].

In the 1980s, a group organized to walk across America and through Europe to [[Moscow]] to show solidarity with all people and to demonstrate in a grass roots way that all people are linked by their right to live on the earth in peace and safety. This walk was conceived by organizers while on another peace walk "A Walk for Survival" (from Santa Cruz, California to Washington State) in 1980. While at a requested meeting with the Russian Consulate in San Francisco one organizer, Jack Chalmers asked if we continued our walk across America, and Europe would we be allowed to walk to Moscow? The Consulate answered "of course". "A Walk for Survival" ended at Bangor, [[Washington (state)|Washington]] State at the site of a Trident nuclear submarine base, and the organizers immediately started planning "A Walk to Moscow". The walk started in Bangor on March 1, 1981 and reached the East Coast in time to winter it out in [[Boston]], before flying to Europe in March 1982. The summer of 1982 was spent walking across the UK (with a side-tip to Ireland), France, Belgium, and [[Federal Republic of Germany]] (with a trip to [[West Berlin]] by bus which returned to its starting point in order for the walking route to continue uninterrupted.) The Walk operated by sending advance teams a few weeks ahead to cities and towns along a prospective path to set up press, speaking engagements and accommodations for the group. Decisions were made only by complete consensus, which often led to long and stormy meetings.

The [[German Democratic Republic]] had refused entry to the group, so they walked south to [[Bavaria]] and stayed there for the winter, while negotiating visas for [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Poland]] and the USSR.  A Walk to Moscow (the indefinite article rather than the definite "The Walk" was important to many of the original walkers, as it implied that it was only one initiative, and others would hopefully follow.  The distinction was, however, lost on people in the Eastern countries of the route,as Slavonic languages do not have words for either an or the!) spent nearly a year in Europe working from an Old Mill in [[Regnitzlosau]] in [[Bavaria]], Germany. It was difficult to get the governments then in the [[Communist]] Bloc to allow the group to walk through their territory. While the group negotiated with the government of Czechoslovakia, Poland and Russia the walkers visited many places on foot in Germany and gave talks to local Peace groups. Some members of the group got involved in [[passive resistance]] chaining themselves to railings over conscription in Germany or others fasted for peace in the world. Members went to Denmark to join in with peace groups and talk about the walk.

In 1983 visas were obtained for Czechoslovakia and Poland, and a continuous walking route was planned and successfully carried out as far as the border between Poland and the USSR.

Relations with official "peace" groups in those countries were tricky, and the Czech government tried to incorporate the initiative into their showpiece pro-[[Warsaw Pact]] 1983 conference in [[Prague]] - however the group did not partake, although a few members lobbied delegates outside, and were invited in for one discussion).  Walking across the USSR was not permitted however.  The group entered and transited to [[Minsk]], then [[Smolensk]], hoping for some compromise in negotiations, but this did not happen.  At this point many of the members chose to return, and not go to Moscow; the others tried to walk to Moscow anyway, but were immediately apprehended and sent to rejoin the others in Minsk.  Some members went to Denmark to join in with peace groups and talk about the walk. When the walk finished some people from the group talked at a [[CND]] rally about their work and the passive resistance movement. The group membership was international, people came from all over the world to join in and make a difference.

Some Walk to Moscow participants later met with other walks that crossed the U.S. and Europe, including [[Walk of the People - A Pilgrimage for Life]], which occurred from 1984 to 1985.

===Women Cross DMZ===
The [[Women Cross DMZ]] ([[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Korean demilitarized zone]]) group, which includes noted American feminist and activist [[Gloria Steinem]], [[Nobel Peace]] Prize laureate Mairead Maguire, and organizer [[Christine Ahn]] with other activist women members, have conducted a peace symposium in [[Pyongyang]] on May 20, 2015 and this women group walked across the DMZ, separating North and South Korea for peace on May 24, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://time.com/3890280/gloria-steinem-north-korea-south-womencrossdmz/ | work=Time | first=Sabrina | last=Toppa | title=Gloria Steinem in North Korea for DMZ Peace March | date=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/women-activists-defend-north-korea-trip-on-capitol-hill#.sx3Ll3DK&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[attempt]] to commit an unconsummated crime is viewed as having the same gravity as if the crime had occurred. But preparation that falls short of an actual attempt is not, although it may be punishable in some other way.

Courts have not been able to draw a clear bright line as to when acts committed in preparation for a crime are actually an attempt to commit the crime.

Some approaches, summarized in the case of ''[[United States v. Mandujano]]'', include the [[physical proximity doctrine]], the [[dangerous proximity doctrine]], the [[indispensable element test]], the [[probable desistance test]], the [[abnormal step]] approach, and the [[uneqivocality test]].

The [[Model Penal Code]] approach requires a [[substantial step]], in addition to having a criminal [[purpose]].

==Linguistic aspects==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
The cultural keyword ''qì'' is analyzable in terms of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations]]. Possible [[etymologies]] include the [[logograph]]s 氣, 气, and 気 with various [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]] ranging from "vapor" to "anger", and the [[English language|English]] [[loanword]] ''qi'' or ''ch'i''.

===Pronunciations and etymologies===
The logograph 氣 is read with two Chinese pronunciations, the usual ''qì'' 氣 "air; vital energy" and the rare archaic ''xì'' 氣 "to present food" (later disambiguated with 餼).

Pronunciations of 氣 in modern [[varieties of Chinese]] with standardized [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] equivalents include: [[Standard Chinese]] ''qì''   /t͡ɕʰi⁵¹/, [[Wu Chinese]] ''qi''   /t͡ɕʰi³⁴/, [[Southern Min]] ''khì'' /kʰi²¹/, [[Eastern Min]] ''ké'' /kʰɛi²¹³/, [[Standard Cantonese]] ''hei&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' /hei̯³³/, and [[Hakka Chinese]] ''hi'' /hi⁵⁵/.

Pronunciations of 氣 in Sino-Xenic borrowings include: [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ''ki'', [[Korean language|Korean]] ''gi'', and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] ''khi''.

Reconstructions of the [[Middle Chinese]] pronunciation of 氣 standardized to IPA transcription include: /kʰe̯i&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;/  ([[Bernard Karlgren]]), /kʰĭəi&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;/ ([[Wang Li (linguist)|Wang Li]]), /kʰiəi&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;/ ([[Li Rong (linguist)|Li Rong]]), /kʰɨj&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;/ ([[Edwin Pulleyblank]]), and /kʰɨi&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;/ ([[Zhengzhang Shangfang]]).

Reconstructions of the [[Old Chinese]] pronunciation of 氣 standardized to IPA transcription include: /*kʰɯds/ (Zhengzhang Shangfang) and /*C.qʰəp-s/ ([[William H. Baxter]] and [[Laurent Sagart]]).

The etymology of ''qì'' interconnects with [[Kharia language|Kharia]] ''kʰis'' "anger", [[Sora language|Sora]] ''kissa'' "move with great effort", [[Khmer language|Khmer]] ''kʰɛs'' "strive after; endeavor", and [[Gyalrongic languages|Gyalrongic]] ''kʰɐs'' "anger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schuessler|first1=Axel|title=ABC Etymological Dictionary of Old Chinese|date=2006|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=9780824829759|page=423|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIvqAC7FNBQC|accessdate=5 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characters===
In the [[East Asian languages]], ''qì'' has three logographs:
*[[wikt:氣|氣]] is the [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese character]], Korean ''[[hanja]]'', and Japanese ''[[kyūjitai]]'' ("old character form") ''[[kanji]]''
*[[wikt:気|気]] is the Japanese ''[[shinjitai]]'' ("new character form") ''kanji''
*[[wikt:气|气]] is the [[simplified Chinese character]].
In addition, ''qì'' [[wikt:炁|炁]] is an uncommon character especially used in writing [[Fulu|Daoist talismans]]. Historically, the word ''qì'' was generally written as 气 until the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 CE), when it was replaced by the 氣 graph clarified with ''mǐ'' [[wikt:米|米]] "rice" indicating "steam (rising from rice as it cooks.)"

This primary logograph 气, the earliest written character for ''qì,'' consisted of three wavy horizontal lines seen in [[Shang dynasty]] (c. 1600–1046 BCE) [[oracle bone script]], [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046–256 BCE) [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|bronzeware script]] and [[large seal script]], and [[Qin dynasty]] (221–206 BCE) [[small seal script]]. These oracle, bronze, and seal scripts logographs 气  were used in ancient times as a [[phonetic loan character]] to write ''qǐ'' 乞 "plead for; beg; ask" which did not have an early character.

The vast majority of Chinese characters are classified as [[Phono-semantic compound|radical-phonetic characters]]. Such characters combine a semantically suggestive "[[radical (Chinese character)|radical characters]]" with a phonetic element approximating ancient pronunciation. For example, the widely known word ''dào'' [[wikt:道|道]] "the [[Tao|Dao]]; the way" graphically combines the [[Radical 162|"walk" radical]] 辶 with a ''shǒu'' 首 "head" phonetic. Although the modern ''dào'' and ''shǒu'' pronunciations are dissimilar, the [[Old Chinese]] ''*lˤuʔ-s'' 道 and ''*l̥uʔ-s'' 首 were alike. The [[regular script]] character ''qì'' [[wikt:氣|氣]] is unusual because ''qì'' [[wikt:气|气]] is both the [[Radical 84|"air radical"]] and the phonetic, with ''mǐ'' 米 "rice" semantically indicating "steam; vapor".

This ''qì'' 气 "air/gas radical" was only used in a few native Chinese characters like ''yīnyūn'' 氤氲 "thick mist/smoke", but was also used to create new scientific [[Chemical elements in East Asian languages#Chinese|characters for gaseous chemical elements]]. Some examples are based on pronunciations in European languages: ''fú'' 氟 (with a ''fú'' 弗 phonetic) "[[fluorine]]" and ''nǎi'' 氖 (with a ''nǎi'' 乃 phonetic) "[[neon]]". Others are based on semantics: ''qīng'' 氫 (with a ''jīng'' 巠 phonetic, abbreviating ''qīng'' 輕 "light-weight") "[[hydrogen]] (the lightest element)" and ''lǜ'' 氯 (with a ''lù'' 彔 phonetic, abbreviating ''lǜ'' 綠 "green") "(greenish-yellow) [[chlorine]]".

''Qì'' 氣 is the phonetic element in a few characters such as ''kài'' 愾 "hate" with the [[Radical 61|"heart-mind radical"]] 忄or 心, ''xì'' 熂 "set fire to weeds" with the [[Radical 86|"fire radical"]] 火, and ''xì'' 餼 "to present food" with the [[Radical 184|"food radical"]] 食.

The first Chinese dictionary of characters, the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]''(121 CE) notes that the primary ''qì'' 气 is a [[Chinese character classification#Pictograms|pictographic character]] depicting 雲气 "cloudy vapors", and that the full 氣 combines 米 "rice" with the phonetic ''qi'' 气, meaning 饋客芻米 "present provisions to guests" (later disambiguated as ''xì'' 餼).

===Meanings===
Qi is a [[polysemous]] word. The unabridged Chinese-Chinese character dictionary ''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'' defines it as "present food or provisions" for the ''xì'' pronunciation but also lists 23 meanings for the ''qì'' pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mair|first1=Victor H.|title=An Alphabetical Index to the Hanyu Da Cidian|date=2003|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu, Hawaii|isbn=978-0824828165|page=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern ''ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary,'' which enters ''xì'' 餼 "grain; animal feed; make a present of food", and a ''qì'' 氣 entry with seven translation equivalents for the noun, two for [[bound morphemes]], and three equivalents for the verb. &lt;blockquote&gt;'''n.''' ① air; gas ② smell ③ spirit; vigor; morale ④ vital/material energy (in Ch[inese] metaphysics) ⑤ tone; atmosphere; attitude ⑥ anger ⑦ breath; respiration '''b.f.''' ① weather 天氣 ''tiānqì'' ② [linguistics] aspiration 送氣 ''sòngqì'' '''v.''' ① anger ② get angry ③ bully; insult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Defrancis|first1=John|last2=Yuqing|first2=Bai|title=ABC Chinese-English Dictionary|date=1999|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=978-0824821548|page=465}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===English borrowing===
Qi was an early [[List of English words of Chinese origin|Chinese loanword]] in English. It was [[Romanization of Chinese|romanized]] as ''k'i'' in [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī|Church Romanization]] in the early-19th century, as ''ch'i'' in [[Wade–Giles]] in the mid-19th century (sometimes misspelled ''chi'' omitting the apostrophe), and as qi in [[Pinyin]] in the mid-20th century. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' entry for ''qi'' gives the pronunciation as [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] (tʃi), the etymology from Chinese ''qì'' "air; breath", and a definition of "The physical life-force postulated by certain Chinese philosophers; the material principle." It also gives eight usage examples, with the first recorded example of ''k'í'' in 1850 (''[[The Chinese Repository]]''),&lt;ref group=note&gt;Quoting [[Confucius]] that the ''[[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]]'' or "Great Extreme is the primordial substance (''k'í'') which, moving along, divided and made two ''k'í''; that which in itself has motion is the ''Yang'', and that which had rest .‥ is the ''Yin''."&lt;/ref&gt; of ''ch'i'' in 1917 (''[[The Encyclopaedia Sinica]]''),&lt;ref group=note&gt;The essence of the ethical principle ''[[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|Li]]'' "is absolutely pure and good, but seeing that it is inseparable from the material element ''Ch'i''.‥ it is from Man's birth to a greater or less extent impeded and tainted."&lt;/ref&gt; and ''qi'' in 1971 ([[Felix Mann]]'s ''Acupuncture'')&lt;ref group=note&gt;"To the ancients the cornerstone of the theory of acupuncture, the concept whereby they explained its effects and action, was ''Qi'', the energy of life."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2012}}
References to concepts analogous to qi are found in many Asian belief systems. Philosophical conceptions of qi from the earliest records of [[Chinese philosophy]] (5th century BCE) correspond to Western notions of [[humours]], the ancient Hindu [[yoga|yogic]] concept of ''[[prana]]'', and the traditional Jewish concept of ''[[Animal soul|nefesh]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mitzvot of Health and Exercise|url=http://www.koshertorah.com/PDF/healthexercise.pdf|website=KoshaTorah.com|accessdate=5 January 2017|date=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early form of qi comes from the writings of the Chinese philosopher [[Mencius]] (4th century BCE).

{{quotation|Within the framework of Chinese thought, no notion may attain such a degree of abstraction from empirical data as to correspond perfectly to one of our modern universal concepts. Nevertheless, the term ''qi'' comes as close as possible to constituting a generic designation equivalent to our word "energy". When Chinese thinkers are unwilling or unable to fix the quality of an energetic phenomenon, the character ''qi'' (氣) inevitably flows from their brushes.|Manfred Porkert&lt;ref name="Porkert"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porkert|first1=Manfred|title=The Theoretical Foundations of Chinese Medicine: Systems of Correspondence|date=1974|publisher=M.I.T. Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0262160582|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2017}}}}

The ancient Chinese described qi as "life force". They believed it permeated everything and linked their surroundings together. Qi was also linked to the flow of energy around and through the body, forming a cohesive functioning unit. By understanding the rhythm and flow of qi, they believed they could guide exercises and treatments to provide stability and longevity.

Although the concept has been important within many Chinese philosophies, over the centuries the descriptions of qi have varied and have sometimes been in conflict. Until China came into contact with Western scientific and philosophical ideas, the Chinese had not categorized all things in terms of matter and energy. Qi and ''li'' (理: "pattern") were 'fundamental' categories similar to matter and energy.

Fairly early on{{when|date=November 2017}}, some Chinese thinkers began to believe that there were different fractions of qi—the coarsest and heaviest fractions formed solids, lighter fractions formed liquids, and the most ethereal fractions were the "lifebreath" that animated living beings.&lt;ref&gt;Definitions and brief historical notes on such concepts can be found in Wei Zhengtong's "Zhong Guo Zhexue Cidian", Da Lin Publishing Company, Taipei, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Yuán qì]]'' is a notion of innate or prenatal qi which is distinguished from acquired qi that a person may develop over their lifetime.

==Philosophical roots==
{{Multiple issues|section=yes|
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2017}}

}}
The earliest texts that speak of qi give some indications of how the concept developed. In the [[Analects]] of [[Confucius]] qi could mean "breath".&lt;ref name="Confucius"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Legge|first1=James|title=The Analects of Confucius|date=2010|publisher=Floating Press|location=Auckland|isbn=978-1775417958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining it with the Chinese word for [[blood]] (making 血氣, ''xue''–''qi'', blood and breath), the concept could be used to account for motivational characteristics:

{{quotation|The [morally] noble man guards himself against 3 things. When he is young, his ''xue''–''qi'' has not yet stabilized, so he guards himself against sexual passion. When he reaches his prime, his ''xue''–''qi'' is not easily subdued, so he guards himself against combativeness. When he reaches old age, his ''xue''–''qi'' is already depleted, so he guards himself against acquisitiveness.|Confucius|Analects, 16:7}}

The philosopher [[Mozi]] used the word qi to refer to noxious vapors that would in eventually arise from a corpse were it not buried at a sufficient depth.&lt;ref name="Mozi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watson|first1=Burton|title=Mozi: Basic Writings|date=2003|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0231130011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reported that early civilized humans learned how to live in houses to protect their qi from the moisture that troubled them when they lived in caves.&lt;ref name="Mozi"/&gt; He also associated maintaining one's qi with providing oneself with adequate nutrition.&lt;ref name="Mozi"/&gt; In regard to another kind of qi, he recorded how some people performed a kind of prognostication by observing qi (clouds) in the sky.&lt;ref name="Mozi"/&gt;

[[Mencius]] described a kind of qi that might be characterized as an individual's vital energies. This qi was necessary to activity and it could be controlled by a well-integrated willpower.&lt;ref name="Mencius"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lau|first1=D. C.|title=Mencius|date=2003|publisher=Chinese University Press|location=Hong Kong|isbn=978-9622018518|edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2017}} When properly nurtured, this qi was said to be capable of extending beyond the human body to reach throughout the [[universe]].&lt;ref name="Mencius"/&gt; It could also be augmented by means of careful exercise of one's moral capacities.&lt;ref name="Mencius"/&gt; On the other hand, the qi of an individual could be degraded by adverse external forces that succeed in operating on that individual.&lt;ref name="Mencius"/&gt;

Living things were not the only things believed to have qi. [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]] indicated that [[wind]] is the ''qi'' of the [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="Zhuangzi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watson|first1=Burton|title=The Complete Works of Zhuangzi|date=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0231536509}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, cosmic [[yin and yang]] "are the greatest of qi{{-"}}.&lt;ref name="Zhuangzi"/&gt; He described qi as "issuing forth" and creating profound effects.&lt;ref name="Zhuangzi"/&gt; He also said "Human beings are born [because of] the accumulation of ''qi''. When it accumulates there is life. When it dissipates there is death... There is one ''qi'' that connects and pervades everything in the world."&lt;ref name="Zhuangzi"/&gt;

Another passage traces life to intercourse between Heaven and Earth: "The highest Yin is the most restrained. The highest Yang is the most exuberant. The restrained comes forth from Heaven. The exuberant issues forth from Earth. The two intertwine and penetrate forming a harmony, and [as a result] things are born."&lt;ref name="Zhuangzi"/&gt;

The [[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]] essay ''[[Neiye]]'' (Inward Training) is the oldest received writing on the subject of the cultivation of vapor ''[qi]'' and [[meditation]] techniques. The essay was probably composed at the Jixia Academy in Qi in the late fourth century B.C.&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Loewe|first1=Michael|last2=Shaughnessy|first2=Edward L.|title=The Cambridge History of Ancient China: From the Origins of Civilization to 221 BC.|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521470308|page=880|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHA7Ey0-pbEC&amp;dq=cambridge++history+of+ancient+china&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Xun Zi]], another Confucian scholar of the [[Jixia Academy]], followed in later years. At 9:69/127, Xun Zi says, "Fire and water have ''qi'' but do not have life. Grasses and trees have life but do not have perceptivity. Fowl and beasts have perceptivity but do not have ''yi'' (sense of right and wrong, duty, justice). Men have ''qi'', life, perceptivity, and ''yi''." Chinese people at such an early time had no concept of [[radiant energy]], but they were aware that one can be heated by a [[campfire]] from a distance away from the fire. They accounted for this phenomenon by claiming "''qi''" radiated from fire. At 18:62/122, he also uses "''qi''" to refer to the vital forces of the body that decline with advanced age.

Among the animals, the [[gibbon]] and the [[crane (bird)|crane]] were considered experts at inhaling the ''qi''. The Confucian scholar [[Dong Zhongshu]] (ca. 150 BC) wrote in [[Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guilk|first1=Robert van|authorlink=Robert van Gulik|title=The Gibbon in China: An Essay in Chinese Animal Lore|date=2015|publisher=E.J. Brill|location=|isbn=978-7547507391|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The gibbon resembles a macaque, but he is larger, and his color is black. His forearms being long, he lives eight hundred years, because he is expert in controlling his breathing." ("猿似猴。大而黑。長前臂。所以壽八百。好引氣也。")

Later, the [[syncretic]] text assembled under the direction of [[Liu An]], the [[Huainanzi|Huai Nan Zi]], or "Masters of Huainan", has a passage that presages most of what is given greater detail by the [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucians]]:

{{quote|Heaven (seen here as the ultimate source of all being) falls (''duo'' 墮, i.e., descends into proto-immanence) as the formless. Fleeting, fluttering, penetrating, amorphous it is, and so it is called the Supreme Luminary. The ''dao'' begins in the Void Brightening. The Void Brightening produces the universe (''yu''–''zhou''). The universe produces ''qi''. ''Qi'' has bounds. The clear, yang ''[qi]'' was ethereal and so formed heaven. The heavy, turbid ''[qi]'' was congealed and impeded and so formed earth. The conjunction of the clear, yang ''[qi]'' was fluid and easy. The conjunction of the heavy, turbid ''[qi]'' was strained and difficult. So heaven was formed first and earth was made fast later. The pervading essence (''xi''–''jing'') of heaven and earth becomes yin and yang. The concentrated (''zhuan'') essences of yin and yang become the four seasons. The dispersed (''san'') essences of the four seasons become the myriad creatures. The hot ''qi'' of yang in accumulating produces fire. The essence (''jing'') of the fire-''qi'' becomes the sun. The cold ''qi'' of yin in accumulating produces water. The essence of the water-''qi'' becomes the moon. The essences produced by coitus (yin) of the sun and moon become the stars and celestial markpoints (''chen'', planets).|Huai-nan-zi|3:1a/19}}

==Role in traditional Chinese medicine==
The ''[[Huangdi Neijing]]'' ''(''"The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Medicine", circa 2nd century BCE) is historically credited with first establishing the pathways, called [[meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]], through which qi circulates in the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yu|first1=Deng|last2=Shuanli|first2=Zhu|last3=Hai|first3=Deng|title=Generalized Quanta Wave with Qi on Traditional Chinese Medecine|journal=Journal of Mathematical Medicine|date=1 January 2002|volume=15|issue=4|url=http://caod.oriprobe.com/articles/4807704/Generalized_Quanta_Wave_with_Qi_on_Traditional_Chinese_Medecine.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Veith|first1=Ilza|last2=Rose|first2=Ken|title=Huang ti nei ching su wên = The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Medicine|date=2002|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520229365|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;ref name="Lawson-Wood"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lawson-Wood|first1=Denis|last2=Lawson-Wood|first2=Joyce|title=Acupuncture Handbook|date=1983|publisher=Health Science Press|pages=4, 133}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ISBN missing|date=November 2015}}

In traditional Chinese medicine, [[symptom]]s of various illnesses are believed to be either the product of disrupted, blocked, and unbalanced ''qi'' movement through meridians or deficiencies and imbalances of qi in the [[Zang Fu theory|''Zang Fu'' organs]].&lt;ref name="Lawson-Wood"/&gt; Traditional Chinese medicine often seeks to relieve these imbalances by adjusting the circulation of ''qi'' using a variety of techniques including [[herbology]], [[food therapy]], physical training regimens ([[qigong]], [[t'ai chi ch'uan]], and other [[martial arts]] training),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wu|first=Kung-tsao|title=Wu Family T'ai Chi Ch'uan (吳家太極拳)|publisher=Chien-ch’uan T’ai-chi Ch’uan Association|origyear=1980|year=2006|isbn=978-0978049904|title-link=Jianquan Taijiquan Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2017}} [[moxibustion]], ''[[tui na]]'', or [[acupuncture]].&lt;ref name="Lawson-Wood"/&gt;{{rp|78}}

The [[nomenclature]] of Qi in the human body is different depending on its sources, roles, and locations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.orientmama.com/journal/what-is-qi-in-chinese-medicine|title=What is Qi in Chinese medicine?|last=|first=|date=Apr 23, 2018|website=The Journal of Chinese Medicine on Orient Mama|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Apr 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For sources there is a difference between so-called "Primordial Qi" (acquired at birth from one's parents) and Qi acquired throughout one's life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Or again Chinese medicine differentiates between Qi acquired from the air we breathe (so called "Clean Air") and Qi acquired from food and drinks (so-called "Grain Qi"). Looking at roles Qi is divided into "Defensive Qi" and "Nutritive Qi".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Defensive Qi's role is to defend the body against invasions while Nutritive Qi's role is to provide sustenance for the body. Lastly, looking at locations, Qi is also named after the [[Zang-fu|Zang-Fu organ]] or the [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|Meridian]] in which it resides:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "Liver Qi", "Spleen Qi", etc.

A qi field (''chu-chong'') refers to the cultivation of an energy field by a group, typically for healing or other benevolent purposes.

==Comparable concepts==
Concepts similar to qi can be found in many cultures.

===Religious beliefs===
''[[Prana]]'' in [[Hinduism]] and [[Indian culture]], ''[[Odinani#Chi|chi]]'' in the [[Odinani|Igbo]] religion, ''[[Pneuma (Stoic)|pneuma]]'' in [[ancient Greece]], ''[[mana]]'' in [[Hawaiian culture]], ''[[Lung (Tibetan Buddhism)|lüng]]'' in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], ''[[manitou]]'' in the culture of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], ''[[Ruach|ruah]]'' in [[Jewish culture]]. In [[Western philosophy]], notions of ''[[Potentiality and actuality|energeia]]'', ''[[élan vital]]'', or [[vitalism]] are purported to be similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sachs|first1=Joe|title=Aristotle: Motion and its Place in Nature|journal=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=2005|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-mot/|accessdate=27 January 2018|issn=2161-0002|oclc=956196260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some elements of the ''qi'' concept can be found in the term 'energy' when used in the context of various [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] forms of spirituality and [[alternative medicine]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Popular culture===
Elements of the concept of Qi can also be found in Eastern and Western [[popular culture]]:

* In the [[manga]] ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' and the video game series ''[[Tekken]]'', Qi is depicted as something that can be visibly seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hillard|first1=Kyle|title=Developers (And Others) Share Their Appreciation And Dream Games For The Dragon Ball Franchise|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/10/20/developers-and-others-share-their-appreciation-for-the-dragon-ball-franchise.aspx|website=[[Game Informer]]|accessdate=21 October 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021011253/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/10/20/developers-and-others-share-their-appreciation-for-the-dragon-ball-franchise.aspx|archivedate=21 October 2017|date=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Parallels with Qi can be seen with the concept of "[[the Force]] " in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porter|first1=John M.|title=The Tao of Star Wars|date=2002|publisher=Humanics|location=Atlanta, Georgia|isbn=9780893343859|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2017}} and the related [[Jediism]], a religion based on the [[Jedi]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Scientific view==
Qi is a non-scientific, unverifiable concept.&lt;ref name="Lee_SR"/&gt; A 1997 consensus statement on acupuncture by the United States [[National Institutes of Health]] noted that concepts such as qi "are difficult to reconcile with contemporary biomedical information".&lt;ref name="NIH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consensus.nih.gov/1997/1997Acupuncture107html.htm |title=The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Program: Acupuncture |publisher=Consensus.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 [[Skeptoid|Skeptoid podcast]] episode titled "Your Body's Alleged Energy Fields" related a [[Reiki]] practitioner's report of what was happening as she passed her hands over a subject's body:

{{quote|text=What we'll be looking for here, within John's auric field, is any areas of intense heat, unusual coldness, a repelling energy, a dense energy, a magnetizing energy, tingling sensations, or actually the body attracting the hands into that area where it needs the reiki energy, and balancing of John's qi.&lt;ref name="Dunning"/&gt;}}

Evaluating these claims,  author and [[Skeptical movement|scientific skeptic]] [[Brian Dunning (author)|Brian Dunning]] reported:

{{quote|text=...his aura, his qi, his reiki energy. None of these have any counterpart in the physical world. Although she attempted to describe their properties as heat or magnetism, those properties are already taken by – well, heat and magnetism. There are no properties attributable to the mysterious field she describes, thus it cannot be authoritatively said to exist.&lt;ref name = Dunning/&gt;}}

==Practices involving qi==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2017}}

===Feng shui===
{{Main|Feng shui}}
The traditional Chinese art of [[geomancy]], the placement and arrangement of space called [[feng shui]], is based on calculating the balance of qi, interactions between the [[Wu Xing|five elements]], [[yin and yang]], and other factors. The retention or dissipation of qi is believed to affect the health, wealth, energy level, luck, and many other aspects of the occupants. Attributes of each item in a space affect the flow of qi by slowing it down, redirecting it or accelerating it. This is said to influence the energy level of the occupants.

One use for a ''[[luopan]]'' is to detect the flow of qi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Field|first1=Stephen L.|title=Qimancy, Chinese Divination by Qi|url=http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html|website=Professor Field's Fengshui Gate|accessdate=7 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223065625/http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html|archivedate=23 February 2017|date=12 February 1998|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of qi may rise and fall over time. Feng shui with a compass might be considered a form of [[divination]] that assesses the quality of the local environment.

===Qigong===
{{Main|Qigong}}
Qìgōng (气功 or 氣功) involves coordinated breathing, movement, and awareness. It is traditionally viewed as a practice to cultivate and balance qi. With roots in [[traditional Chinese medicine]], [[Chinese philosophy|philosophy]] and [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts]], ''qigong'' is now practiced worldwide for exercise, healing, meditation, and training for martial arts. Typically a ''qigong'' practice involves rhythmic breathing, slow and stylized movement, a [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindful]] state, and visualization of guiding qi.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Kenneth S.|last2=Dossey|first2=Larry|title=The Way of Qigong: The Art and Science of Chinese Energy Healin|date=1999|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0345421098|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;ref name="Liang"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liang|first1=Master Shou-Yu|last2=Wu|first2=Wen-Ching|last3=Breiter-Wu|first3=Denise|title=Qigong Empowerment: A Guide to Medical, Taoist, Buddhist, and Wushu Energy Cultivation|date=1997|publisher=Way of the Dragon Publishing|location=East Providence, Rhode Island|isbn=978-1889659022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jwing-Ming"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jwing-Ming|first1=Yang|title=Qigong for Health and Martial Arts: Exercises and Meditation|date=1998|publisher=YMAA Publication Center|location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1886969575|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2017}}

Demonstrations of ''qi'' or ''ki'' are popular in some [[martial arts]] and may include the unraisable body, the unbendable arm, and other feats of power. Some of these feats can alternatively be explained using [[biomechanics]] and physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=James|first1=Daniel Arthur|title=Unraisable Body: The Physics of Martial Arts|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/29458989|publisher=Sports Medicine Australia|accessdate=5 January 2017|date=27 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acupuncture and moxibustion===
{{Main|Acupuncture|Moxibustion}}

[[Acupuncture]] is a part of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] that involves insertion of needles into superficial structures of the body (skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscles) at [[acupuncture point]]s to balance the flow of qi. This is often accompanied by [[moxibustion]], a treatment that involves burning [[mugwort]] on or near the skin at an acupuncture point.

The '''right to personal identity''' is recognised in international law through a range of declarations and conventions. From as early as birth, an individual’s identity is formed and preserved by registration or being bestowed with a name. However, [[personal identity]] becomes more complex as an individual develops a conscience. But [[human rights]] exist to defend and protect individuality, as quoted by [http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/law/people/jill-marshall Professor Jill Marshall]: "Human rights law exist to ensure that individual lifestyle choices are protected from majoritarian or populist infringement."&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the complexity of personal identity, it is preserved and encouraged through privacy, personality rights and the right to self-expression.

==Concept and history==

The right to personal identity begins with the [[right to life]]. It is only through existing that individuals can cultivate their identity. Nevertheless, since ancient Greek philosophy, humans have been recognised with a "soul", making them more than physical bone and flesh. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] was created to preserve the biological and philosophical elements of human beings since its establishment in 1948. Therefore, the notion of individual identity and personality has been encouraged and preserved from the birth of human rights. However, throughout the years there have been developments towards the protection of personal identity through avenues that manifest identity such as private life, expression rights, personality rights and the right to know your biological origin.

==Private life==

Article 8 of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] has been interpreted to include "personal identity" within the meaning of "private life." &lt;ref&gt;''Goodwin v the UK'' (2002) 35 EHRR 18 at 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 8 protects against unwanted intrusion and provides for the respect of an individual's private space. Professor Marshall explains that this is important to be uninterrupted and to "think reflectively without interference is to be in control of one’s own faculties,"&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "Human Rights Law and Personal Identity", ''Taylor and Francis'', 2014 at 36.&lt;/ref&gt; as Macklem puts it: "independence of mind."&lt;ref&gt;T Macklem,"Independence of Mind", ''Oxford: OUP'', 2006 at 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This protection of inner privacy allows individuals to develop and cultivate their personal identity. "Private life" has also be interpreted to protect the development of relationships.The ECHR highlighted in the case of ''Bruggemann and Scheuten v Germany Yearbook'' the significance of relationships concerning the "emotional field" and "the development of one’s own personality."&lt;ref&gt;''Bruggemann and Scheuten v Germany Yearbook'' XIX [1976] at 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect of privacy comes respect for personal autonomy, which Article 8 has also been interpreted to protect.&lt;ref&gt;''Goodwin v the UK'' (2002) 35 EHRR 18 at 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://echr-online.info/article-8-echr/ ECHR Online] states that the scope of Article 8 is to "embrace personal autonomy" and the freedom to make choices without the interference of the state to develop one’s own personal life. As illustrated by the [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/personal-autonomy/ Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy], through protecting a person’s autonomy,  a person’s identity is also protected, as both are integral to each other.

==Expression rights==

The Declaration of Human Rights Article 19 and Article 10 of the ECHR give everyone the right to freedom of opinion and expression. Macklem explains that "[[freedom of expression]] is not merely the freedom to communicate one’s voice to others. It is more importantly the freedom to develop a distinctive voice of one’s own."&lt;ref&gt;T Macklem, "Independence of Mind", ''Oxford: OUP'', 2006 at 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Articles 19 and 10 encourage the manifestation of personal identity. In the case of ''Handyside v UK'' the court stated "Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of such a society, one of the basic conditions for its progress and for the development of every man."&lt;ref&gt;''Handyside v United Kingdom'' (App 5493/72) ECHR 7 December 1976 at 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of expression not only endorses individuals to participate and contribute to public life but it also gives them the opportunity to discover who they personally are.

Article 9 of the ECHR also provides the right to freedom (and the manifestation) of thought, conscience and religion. According to [[John Locke|Locke]], thought and consciousness establish personal identity, for these are the foundations of who a person is. In addition, a person’s beliefs also contribute to internal and external identity.&lt;ref&gt;S Weinberg, "Locke on Personal Identity", ''Philosophy Compass'' University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign at 399.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some believe women who have freely chosen to wear the Islamic headscarf or full-face veil are expressing their religious beliefs and personal identity. This has led to much debate and controversy within states which have banned the wearing of full-face veils in public.

===Full-face veils===

As of 2011, both Belgium and [[French ban on face covering|France]] have banned the full-face Islamic veil in public places. The ban occurred under the administration of [[President Sarkozy]], who stated that veils oppressed women and were [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13038095 "not welcome"] in France. But Marshall highlights that the ban is disproportionate and it is not government's place to determine what women should wear especially when it misrecognises her and disrespects her identity and personality.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 72.&lt;/ref&gt; While France explains that the intentions of the ban were to promote public order and secularism, ''Arslan v Turkey'' held that Article 9 had been violated&lt;ref&gt;''Arslan and Others'' v Turkey Application. 41135/98 Judgement 23 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and that France has failed to recognise the intrinsic worth of women who freely choose to wear such veils.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 69.&lt;/ref&gt; As illustrated under Article 1 of the Declaration of Human Rights, all beings are born equal and therefore have equal worth. Finally, [[Amnesty International]] has repeatedly urged France not to impose the ban, saying it violates European human rights law.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The issue of the full-face veil ban in France and Belgium illustrates the extent of legal protection an individual has on their personal identity. Being empowered to make self-determined choices, such as freely choosing to wear a full-face veil to illustrate beliefs, Marshall believes, is an interpreted concept of human dignity and human freedom, allowing each woman's identity to be legally recognised.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The enjoyment of these rights and freedoms in the ECHR are protected under Article 14, and "shall be secured without discrimination regardless of sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status."

However, these are the opinions of only some scholars. This is a contested issue and others believe that the banning of full-face veils is about liberating females to express their sexuality and providing them the opportunity to show the world who they truly are.&lt;ref&gt;J Selby, "Un/veiling Women’s Bodies: Secularism and Sexuality in Full-face Veil Prohibitions in France and Quebec" ''SAGE Journals'' Vol. 43(3) 2014 at 441.&lt;/ref&gt; These aspects also promote and encourage personal identity.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Personality rights===
The right to have and develop a personality is addressed in Article 22 of the UDHR: "Everyone is entitled to the realisation of the rights needed for one’s dignity and the free development of their personality." Article 29 also protects the right to develop one’s personality: "[e]veryone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible." Manuc explains that personality rights can be defined as those expressing the quintessence of the human person, and are intrinsic to being human.&lt;ref&gt;L Manuc "Features and Evolution References to Personality Rights" ''Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice'' Vol 4(1) 2012 at 362.&lt;/ref&gt; These rights recognise the "spirit" within an individual and have developed from the issues of privacy. Personality rights emerged from the German legal system in the late twentieth century to seek distance from the horrors of Naziism.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 42.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a mechanism to improve tort law surrounding privacy, as illustrated in the ''Criminal Diary''&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Diary'' Case 80 B VerfGE 367 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; case.

The case concerned the issue of personality structure and having the right to determine oneself. Ederle explained this as a right individuals have to choose how to be related in the world. Through the help of the [[German Constitutional Court]], an individual can actively seek and create an intimate sphere so his personality can develop and be protected. Some states see no need for a specific law to personality, as their system of law possesses a different foundation for personality protection.&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Diary'' Case 80 B VerfGE 367 (1989) at 381.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, France, South Africa and England have an all-embracing law that protects an individual’s interest concerning physical integrity, feelings, dignity and privacy and identity.&lt;ref&gt;J Neethling, "Personality Rights: a comparative overview", ''The Comparative and International Law Journal of Southern Africa'' Institute of Foreign and Comparative Law Vol. 38, No. 2 at 213.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in addition to substantial protection to personality through privacy, the Netherlands and Austria also recognise a general right to personality.&lt;ref&gt;J Neethling, "Personality Rights: a comparative overview", ''The Comparative and International Law Journal of Southern Africa'' Institute of Foreign and Comparative Law Vol. 38, No. 2 at 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blood and biological right===
The [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx Convention on the Rights of the Child]&lt;/ref&gt; stresses the value and importance of a child’s identity. Giroux and De Lorenzi separate the understanding of identity into two parts: static and dynamic. The static aspects of identity concern attributes that make one visible to the outside world, for example, physical features, sex, name, genetics, and nationality.&lt;ref&gt;M Giroux and M De Lorenzi, ""Putting the Child First": A Necessary Step in the Recognition of the Right to Identity", ''Canadian Journal of Family Law'' Vol. 27, 2011 at 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamic aspects include morals and religious and cultural characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;M Giroux and M De Lorenzi, ""Putting the Child First": A Necessary Step in the Recognition of the Right to Identity", ''Canadian Journal of Family Law'' Vol. 27, 2011 at 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Article 7, a child has a right to have a "legal" identity by being registered, and has a right to a name and a nationality. These protect mainly the static aspects of identity. However, Article 8 protects and encourages the child’s dynamic aspects of identity through preserving his or her identity in relation to nationality, name and family relations. Article 8 illustrates the state’s duty to protect this right, both passively and actively.&lt;ref&gt;J Doek, "Article 8: The Right to Preservation of Identity" ''A Commentary of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child'' (Leiden: Martinus Nijhoof Publishers, 2006) at 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles 7 and 8 developed to confront the issues of children in political struggles and disappearances.&lt;ref&gt;K O’Donovan, "Real" Mothers for Abandoned Children" ''Law Society Review'' 2002 at 36.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''Gelman v Urugnay''&lt;ref&gt;''Gelman v Urugnay'', Series C No. 221 (IACrtHR), 24 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; concerned the kidnapping of Maria Gelman which prevented her from developing relationships with her parents and concealing her true identity from her. 193 states have ratified the convention, making it the most-ratified convention in history, including all United Nation members except the United States, Somalia and South Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;TEACHUnicef, "The Convention on the Rights of a Child" ''TeachUNICEF Debate Source Book'' at 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Identity is also within people's genes as evidenced by debates concerning anonymity for gamete donation.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2005, in the UK, donor-received people can contact their donor once over 18 to find out where they have come from and prevent genealogical bewilderment.&lt;ref&gt;''Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority'' Act 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are global differences towards the debate; for example, in Canada and the United States there are no regulations, whereas in Switzerland the donor must be willing to be identified, and in France, anonymity is forced.&lt;ref&gt;T Hampton, "Anonymity of Gamete Donations Debated" ''JAMA'' Vol. 294, No. 21 2005 at 2681.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
There are some scholars who believe the right to identity must be treated with caution.&lt;ref&gt;L Bently, "Identity and the Law" in G Walker and E Leedham-Green (eds) ''Identity: The Darwin College Lecture Series'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) at 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosemary Coombe expressed her concerns of personal identity becoming property as there is the belief that through marginalising identity, it could be accepted as private and exclusive property.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 242.&lt;/ref&gt; Lionel Bently is also concerned with this idea and highlights his worry through a quote from the ''Du Boulay'' case: "Property rights in 'identity'… have the potential to curtail the liberties of those who wish to build their own identities, in whatever way, and for whatever reason."&lt;ref&gt;''Belisle Du Boulay v Jules Rene Hermenegilde Du Boulay '' (1869) LR 2 PC 430.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars believe that enshrining personal identity into the law is restricting people's choices and flexibility to transform and change who they are.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 237.&lt;/ref&gt; However, human rights can also perform the contrary and protect individuals' choices on personal identity. While developing personal identity comes down to the individual to manifest character and work out 'who they are,' Marshall highlights that jurisprudence has evolved to create a positive obligation on states to provide social conditions such as private and personality rights to be respected, demonstrating that the international audience  acknowledges that legal recognition is necessary to allow individuals to choose how they want to live and who they are.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sand Mountain blue''' (''Euphilotes pallescens arenamontana'') is a [[butterfly]] of the [[Lycaenidae|gossamer winged]] variety that is only found around the [[Sand Mountain (Nevada)|Sand Mountain Recreation Area]] near [[Fallon, Nevada]].  This species is one of several belonging to the [[Polyommatinae|"blue" subfamily]] of Lycaenidae.&lt;ref name="fws"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sand Mountain Blue Butterfly|url=http://www.fws.gov/nevada/nv_species/smb_butterfly.html|publisher=Nevada Fish and Wildlife Office|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological characteristics==
These butterflies are known for their almost complete dependence upon [[Eriogonum nummulare|Kearney buckwheat]]; eating the fallen leaves of the plant as [[caterpillar|larvae]], and drinking the [[nectar]] of the flowers as adults - however, the adults occasionally feed on other plant species. Like many gossamer-winged butterflies, Sand Mountain blues have a close relationship with [[ant]]s; in this case, desert [[carpenter ant]]s feed on a [[sugar]]y secretion of the larvae; whether the larvae [[mutualism (biology)|also benefit]] or [[commensalism|not]] is yet to be determined. Once the larvae [[metamorphosis|metamorphose]] into the [[pupa]]l stage, rather than remaining fixed to buckwheat plant, the [[Pupa#Chrysalis|chrysalis]] drops into the [[plant litter|leaf litter]] at the base. Upon reaching adulthood, ''E. pallescens arenamontana'' typically measure anywhere between {{convert|10.0|mm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|11.9|mm|in|abbr=on}}.  The species is not known to [[Lepidoptera migration|migrate]], and stays within {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}} of its host plant. The lifespan of an adult Sand Mountain blue is approximately one week.&lt;ref name="fws"/&gt;&lt;ref name="petition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Petition to list the Sand Mountain Blue Butterfly as a Threatened or Endangered Species Under the U.S. Endangered Species Act|url=http://www.fws.gov/nevada/nv_species/documents/smbb/smbb_petition.pdf|format=PDF|author=[[Center for Biological Diversity]] |author2=[[Xerces Society]] |author3=[[Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility]] |author4=Nevada Outdoor Recreation Association |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
The Sand Mountain blue species, ''[[Euphilotes pallescens|E. pallescens]]'' has been officially classified as being [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]], while the subspecies ''E. p. arenamontana'' has been labeled as critically imperiled, at great risk of extinction.&lt;ref name=NS /&gt;  In 2004 a [[petition]] was filed to investigate the [[conservation status|status]] of the Sand Mountain blue and whether it should be placed on the [[endangered species|endangered]] or [[threatened species]] lists.  Currently Sand Mountain blues are referred to as "[[rare species|rare]]" because of their small [[range (biology)|geographical distribution]] around the Sand Mountain [[dune]].&lt;ref name="petition"/&gt; In March 2007, several [[off-road vehicle]] trails were closed off in order to protect the species and its host plant from intrusion.&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Move to protect butterfly steps on off-roaders|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17722427|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an excerpt from the original script of ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'' by [[Quentin Tarantino]].]] --&gt;
'''Screenwriting''', also called '''scriptwriting''', is the art and craft of writing [[Screenplay|scripts]] for [[mass media]] such as [[feature film]]s, [[television production]]s or [[video game]]s. It is often a [[freelance]] profession.

[[Screenwriter]]s are responsible for researching the story, developing the narrative, writing the script, screenplay, dialogues and delivering it, in the required format, to development executives. Screenwriters therefore have great influence over the creative direction and emotional impact of the screenplay and, arguably, of the finished film. Screenwriters either pitch original ideas to producers, in the hope that they will be optioned or sold; or are commissioned by a producer to create a screenplay from a concept, true story, existing screen work or literary work, such as a novel, poem, play, comic book, or short story.

==Types==
The act of screenwriting takes many forms across the entertainment industry. Often, multiple writers work on the same script at different stages of [[Script development|development]] with different tasks. Over the course of a successful career, a screenwriter might be hired to write in a wide variety of roles.

Some of the most common forms of screenwriting jobs include:

===Spec script writing===
[[Spec script]]s are feature film or [[Television program|television show]] scripts written on speculation of sale, without the commission of a [[film studio]], [[production company]] or TV network. The content is usually invented solely by the screenwriter, though spec screenplays can also be based on established works or real people and events. The spec script is a Hollywood sales tool. The vast majority of scripts written each year are spec scripts, but only a small percentage make it to the screen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/movies/267279_screenplay07.html The Great American Screenplay now fuels wannabe authors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] from seattlepi.nwsource.com&lt;/ref&gt; A spec script is usually a wholly original work, but can also be an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]].

In television writing, a spec script is a sample teleplay written to demonstrate the writer's knowledge of a show and ability to imitate its style and conventions. It is submitted to the show's producers in hopes of being hired to write future episodes of the show. Budding screenwriters attempting to break into the business generally begin by writing one or more spec scripts.

Although writing spec scripts is part of any writer's career, the [[Writers Guild of America]] forbids members to write "on speculation". The distinction is that a "spec script" is written as a sample by the writer on his or her own; what is forbidden is writing a script for a specific producer without a contract. In addition to writing a script on speculation, it is generally not advised to write camera angles or other directional terminology, as these are likely to be ignored. A director may write up a shooting script himself or herself, a script that guides the team in what to do in order to carry out the director's vision of how the script should look. The director may ask the original writer to co-write it with him or her, or to rewrite a script that satisfies both the director and producer of the film/TV show.

Spec writing is also unique in that the writer must pitch the idea to producers. In order to sell the script, it must have a killer title, good writing, and a great logline. A logline is one sentence that lays out what the movie is about. A well written logline will convey the tone of the film, introduce the main character, and touch on the primary conflict. Usually the logline and title work in tandem to draw people in, and it is highly suggested to incorporate irony into them when possible. These things, along with nice, clean writing will hugely impact whether or not a producer picks up the spec script.

=== Commissioned screenplay ===
A commissioned screenplay is written by a hired writer. The concept is usually developed long before the screenwriter is brought on, and often has multiple writers work on it before the script is given a [[Green-light|green light]].

===Feature assignment writing===
Scripts written on assignment are screenplays created under contract with a [[Movie studio|studio]], production company, or producer. These are the most common assignments sought after in screenwriting. A screenwriter can get an assignment either exclusively or from "open" assignments. A screenwriter can also be approached and offered an assignment. Assignment scripts are generally adaptations of an existing idea or property owned by the hiring company,&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Willen and Joan Willen, ''How to Sell your Screenplay'', pg 242. Square One Publishers, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; but can also be original works based on a concept created by the writer or producer.

===Rewriting and script doctoring===
Most produced films are rewritten to some extent during the development process. Frequently, they are not rewritten by the original writer of the script.&lt;ref&gt;Skip Press, ''The Ultimate Writer's Guide to Hollywood'', pg xiii. Barnes and Noble Books, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Many established screenwriters, as well as new writers whose work shows promise but lacks marketability, make their living rewriting scripts.

When a script's central premise or characters are good but the script is otherwise unusable, a different writer or team of writers is contracted to do an entirely new draft, often referred to as a "page one rewrite". {{anchor|polish}}When only small problems remain, such as bad dialogue or poor humor, a writer is hired to do a "polish" or "punch-up".

Depending on the size of the new writer's contributions, [[screen credit]] may or may not be given. For instance, in the American film industry, credit to rewriters is given only if 50% or more of the script is substantially changed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.org/subpage_writersresources.aspx?id=171-screen credits policy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from wga.org&lt;/ref&gt; These standards can make it difficult to establish the identity and number of screenwriters who contributed to a film's creation.

When established writers are called in to rewrite portions of a script late in the development process, they are commonly referred to as [[script doctor]]s. Prominent script doctors include Christopher Keane, [[Steve Zaillian]], [[William Goldman]], [[Robert Towne]], [[Mort Nathan]], Quentin Tarantino and Peter Russell.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Wright Wetman. "Success Has 1,000 Fathers (So Do Films)". ''[[The New York Times]]''. May 28, 1995. Arts section, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; Many up-and-coming screenwriters work as ghost writers.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Television writing===
A freelance television writer typically uses spec scripts or previous credits and reputation to obtain a contract to write one or more episodes for an existing television show. After an episode is submitted, rewriting or polishing may be required.

A staff writer for a TV show generally works in-house, writing and rewriting episodes. Staff writers&amp;mdash;often given other titles, such as [[story editor]] or [[Television producer|producer]]&amp;mdash;work both as a group and individually on episode scripts to maintain the show's tone, style, characters, and plots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvwriter.com/faq/faq.htm TV Writer.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929034952/http://www.tvwriter.com/faq/faq.htm |date=2007-09-29 }} from tvwriter.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Television show creators write the [[television pilot]] and [[Bible (screenwriting)|bible]] of new television series. They are responsible for creating and managing all aspects of a show's characters, style, and plots. Frequently, a creator remains responsible for the show's day-to-day creative decisions throughout the series run as [[showrunner]], [[head writer]] or story editor.

====Writing for daily series====
The process of writing for [[soap opera]]s and [[telenovela]]s is different from that used by [[prime time]] shows, due in part to the need to produce new episodes five days a week for several months. In one example cited by [[Jane Espenson]], screenwriting is a "sort of three-tiered system":&lt;ref name="jane"&gt;[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000588.php 08/13/2008: Soapy Scenes], from "Jane in Progress" a blog for aspiring screenwriters by Jane Espenson&lt;/ref&gt;
:a few top writers craft the overall [[story arc]]s. Mid-level writers work with them to turn those arcs into things that look a lot like traditional episode outlines, and an array of writers below that (who do not even have to be local to Los Angeles), take those outlines and quickly generate the dialogue while adhering slavishly to the outlines.

Espenson notes that a recent trend has been to eliminate the role of the mid-level writer, relying on the senior writers to do rough outlines and giving the other writers a bit more freedom. Regardless, when the finished scripts are sent to the top writers, the latter do a final round of rewrites. Espenson also notes that a show that airs daily, with characters who have decades of history behind their voices, necessitates a writing staff without the distinctive voice that can sometimes be present in prime-time series.&lt;ref name="jane"/&gt;

====Writing for game shows====

Game shows feature live contestants, but still use a team of writers as part of a specific format.&lt;ref name="WGA"&gt;[http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=2630 05/15/2010: Writers Guild of America, Reality &amp; Game Show Writers]&lt;/ref&gt; This may involve the slate of questions and even specific phrasing or dialogue on the part of the host. Writers may not script the dialogue used by the contestants, but they work with the producers to create the actions, scenarios, and sequence of events that support the game show's concept.

===Video game writing===
{{Main|Video game writing}}
With the continued development and increased complexity of video games, many opportunities are available to employ screenwriters in the field of [[video game design]]. Video game writers work closely with the other game designers to create characters, scenarios, and dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Skip Press, ''The Ultimate Writer's Guide to Hollywood'', pg207. Barnes and Noble Books, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories on writing a screenplay==
{{Literature}}
Fundamentally, the screenplay is a unique literary form. It is like a musical score, in that it is intended to be interpreted on the basis of other artists' performance, rather than serving as a finished product for the enjoyment of its audience. For this reason, a screenplay is written using technical jargon and tight, spare prose when describing stage directions. Unlike a [[novel]] or [[short story]], a screenplay focuses on describing the literal, visual aspects of the story, rather than on the internal thoughts of its characters. In screenwriting, the aim is to evoke those thoughts and emotions through subtext, action, and [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].&lt;ref&gt;Trottier, David: "The Screenwriter's Bible", pg4. Silman James, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several main screenwriting theories help writers approach the screenplay by systematizing the structure, goals and techniques of writing a script. The most common kinds of theories are structural. Screenwriter William Goldman is widely quoted as saying "Screenplays are structure".

===Three-act structure===
{{Main article|Three-act structure}}
The three acts are setup (of the location and characters), confrontation (with an obstacle), and resolution (culminating in a climax and a dénouement). Usually, in a two-hour film, the first and third acts both typically last around 30 minutes, with the middle act lasting roughly an hour, but today many films start from the confrontation point and then goes to the setup act or they might even start at the last act and then go back to the start.

In ''[[Writing Drama]]'', French writer and director [[Yves Lavandier]] shows a slightly different approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/livre.htm#1STRUC Excerpt on the three-act structure] from Yves Lavandier's ''Writing Drama''&lt;/ref&gt; As do most theorists, he maintains that every human action, whether fictitious or real, contains three logical parts: before the action, during the action, and after the action. But since the climax is part of the action, Yves Lavandier maintains that the second act must include the climax, which makes for a much shorter third act than is found in most screenwriting theories.

Besides the three-act structure, it is also common to use a four- or five-act structure in a screenplay, though certain screenplays may include as many as twenty separate acts.

=== The Hero's Journey ===
The hero's journey, also referred to as the [[monomyth]], is an idea formulated by noted mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]]. The central concept of the monomyth is that a pattern can be seen in stories and myths across history. Campbell defined and explained that pattern in his book ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' (1949).

Campbell's insight was that important myths from around the world, which have survived for thousands of years, all share a fundamental structure. This fundamental structure contains a number of stages, which include
#'''a call to adventure''', which the hero has to accept or decline,
#'''a road of trials''', on which the hero succeeds or fails,
#'''achieving the goal (or "boon")''', which often results in important self-knowledge,
#'''a return to the ordinary world''', which again the hero can succeed or fail, and
#'''application of the boon,''' in which what the hero has gained can be used to improve the world.

Later, screenwriter [[Christopher Vogler]] refined and expanded the hero's journey for the screenplay form in his book, ''[[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers]]'' (1993).

=== Syd Field's Paradigm ===
In his book ''Screenplay'' [[Syd Field]] posited a new theory, which he called the Paradigm. Field noticed that in a 120-page screenplay, Act Two was notoriously boring, and was also twice the length of Acts One and Three. He also noticed that an important dramatic event usually occurred at the middle of the picture, which implied to him that the middle act was actually two acts in one. So the Three Act Structure is notated 1, 2a, 2b, 3, resulting in [[Aristotle]]'s Three Acts divided into four pieces.

Field also introduced the idea of [[plot point|Plot Points]] into screenwriting theory. Plot Points are important structural functions that happen in approximately the same place in most successful movies, like the verses and choruses in a popular song. In subsequent books, Field has added to his original list, and students of his like Viki King and Linda Seger have added to the list of Plot Points. Here is a current list of the major Plot Points that are congruent with Field's Paradigm:

'''Opening Image''': The first image in the screenplay should summarize the entire film, especially its tone. Often, writers go back and redo this as the last thing before submitting the script.

'''Exposition''': Provides some background information to the audience about the plot, characters' histories, setting, and theme.

'''[[Inciting Incident]]''': Also called the catalyst, this is the point in the story when the Protagonist encounters the problem that will change their life. This is when the detective is assigned the case, where Boy meets Girl, and where the Comic Hero gets fired from his cushy job, forcing him into comic circumstances.

'''Plot Point 1''': The last scene in Act One, Plot Point 1 is a surprising development that radically changes the Protagonist's life, and forces him to confront the Opponent. In ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', this is when [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]]'s family is killed by the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]]. He has no home to go back to, so he joins the [[Rebel Alliance|Rebels]] in opposing [[Darth Vader]].

'''Pinch 1''': A reminder scene at about 3/8 the way through the script (halfway through Act 2a) that brings up the central conflict of the drama, reminding us of the overall conflict. For example, in ''Star Wars'', Pinch 1 is the [[Imperial stormtrooper|Stormtroopers]] attacking the [[Millennium Falcon]] in [[Mos Eisley]], reminding us the Empire is after the stolen plans to the [[Death Star]] [[R2-D2]] is carrying and Luke and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Ben Kenobi]] are trying to get to the Rebel Alliance (the main conflict).

'''Midpoint''': An important scene in the middle of the script, often a reversal of fortune or revelation that changes the direction of the story. Field suggests that driving the story towards the Midpoint keeps the second act from sagging.

'''Pinch 2''': Another reminder scene about 5/8 through the script (halfway through Act 2b) that is somehow linked to Pinch 1 in reminding the audience about the central conflict. In ''Star Wars'', Pinch 2 is the Stormtroopers attacking them as they rescue the [[Princess Leia|Princess]] in the Death Star. Both scenes remind us of the Empire's opposition, and using the Stormtrooper attack [[motif (literature)|motif]] unifies both Pinches.

'''Plot Point 2''': A dramatic reversal that ends Act 2 and begins Act 3, which is about confrontation and resolution. Sometimes Plot Point 2 is the moment when the Hero has had enough and is finally going to face the Opponent. Sometimes, like in ''[[Toy Story]]'', it's the low-point for the Hero, and he must bounce back to overcome the odds in Act 3.

'''Showdown''': About midway through Act 3, the Protagonist will confront the Main Problem of the story and either overcome it, or come to a tragic end.

'''Resolution''': The issues of the story are resolved.

'''Tag''': An epilogue, tying up the loose ends of the story, giving the audience closure. This is also known as [[denouement]]. In general, films in recent decades have had longer denouements than films made in the 1970s or earlier.

===The sequence approach===
The sequence approach to screenwriting, sometimes known as "[[Sequence (filmmaking)|eight-sequence structure]]", is a system developed by [[Frank Daniel]], while he was the head of the Graduate Screenwriting Program at [[University of Southern California|USC]]. It is based in part on the fact that, in the early days of cinema, technical matters forced screenwriters to divide their stories into sequences, each the length of a reel (about ten minutes).&lt;ref&gt;Gulino, Paul Joseph: "Screenwriting: The Sequence Approach", pg3. Continuum, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequence approach mimics that early style. The story is broken up into eight 10-15 minute sequences. The sequences serve as "mini-movies", each with their own compressed three-act structure. The first two sequences combine to form the film's first act. The next four create the film's second act. The final two sequences complete the resolution and dénouement of the story. Each sequence's resolution creates the situation which sets up the next sequence.

==Dialogue and description==

===Imagery===
Imagery can be used in many metaphoric ways. In ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)|The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'', the title character talked of wanting to close the door on himself sometime, and then, in the end, he did. [[Pathetic fallacy]] is also frequently used; rain to express a character feeling depressed, sunny days promote a feeling of happiness and calm. Imagery can be used to sway the emotions of the audience and to clue them in to what is happening.

Imagery is well defined in ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]''. The opening image sequence sets the tone for the entire film. The film opens with the shimmer of a knife's blade on a sharpening stone. A drink is being prepared, The knife's blade shows again, juxtaposed is a shot of a chicken letting loose of its harness on its feet. All symbolising 'The One that got away'. The film is about life in the favelas in Rio - sprinkled with violence and games and ambition.

===Dialogue===
Dialogue can be very important to the film industry, because there are no written words to explain the characters or plot; it all has to be explained through dialogue and imagery.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} [[Bollywood]] and other Indian film industries use separate dialogue writers in addition to the [[screenplay writer]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Plot===
{{See also|Act structure}}
While the story is what will be told (narrative); the plot is how the story will be told (narration). This vocabulary is not indisputable for sometimes in literature stories and plots are used exactly the other way around.

==Screenwriting education==
A number of American universities offer specialized [[Master of Fine Arts]] and undergraduate programs in screenwriting, including [[USC School of Cinematic Arts|USC]], [[DePaul University]], [[AFI Conservatory|American Film Institute]], [[Loyola Marymount University]], [[Chapman University]], [[Tisch School of the Arts|NYU]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]],  [[Boston University]] and the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]]. In Europe, the United Kingdom has an extensive range of MA and BA Screenwriting Courses including [[London College of Communication]], [[Bournemouth University]], [[Edinburgh University]], and [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths College (University of London)]]. 

Some schools offer non-degree screenwriting programs, such as the [[TheFilmSchool]], The International Film and Television School Fast Track, and the UCLA Professional / [http://writers.uclaextension.edu/ Extension Programs in Screenwriting].

[[New York Film Academy]] offers both degree and non-degree educational systems with campuses all around the world.

Many screenwriters choose to pursue screenwriting independently with free online educational resources such as ScreenCraft, Keanewords, NoFilmSchool, Film Daily, [[The Black List]], [[John August]] and Craig Mazin's [[Scriptnotes]] podcast, and Julie Gray's Just Effing Entertain Me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Julie|title=Just Effing Entertain Me|date=2013|publisher=Julie Gray|isbn=9781304404831|quote=A comprehensive guide to screenwriting with proven methods to help you test your ideas BEFORE you write your script, outlining tricks that make every page fascinating, chapters on character development, dialogue, theme}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Julie Gray|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julie-gray/|publisher=Huffington Post|quote=A Hollywood refugee living in the Middle East, Julie Gray has authored two books and is working on a memoir.

== History ==
The first true screenplay is thought to be from [[George Melies]]' 1902 film ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]''. The movie is silent, but the screenplay still contains specific descriptions and action lines that resemble a modern-day script. As time went on and films became longer and more complex, the need for a screenplay became more prominent in the industry. The introduction of movie theaters also impacted the development of screenplays, as audiences became more widespread and sophisticated, so the stories had to be as well. Once the first non-silent movie was released in 1927, screenwriting became a hugely important position within Hollywood. The "studio system" of the 1930s only heightened this importance, as studio heads wanted productivity. Thus, having the "blueprint" (continuity screenplay) of the film beforehand became extremely optimal. Around 1970, the "spec script" was first created, and changed the industry for writers forever. Now, screenwriting for television (teleplays) is considered as difficult and competitive as writing is for feature films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://screenwritingfacts.weebly.com/history.html|title=History|website=The Art of Screenwriting|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayed in film==
Screenwriting has been the focus of a number of films:

* ''[[Crashing Hollywood (1931 film)|Crashing Hollywood]]'' (1931)&amp;mdash;A screenwriter collaborates on a gangster movie with a real-life gangster. When the film is released, the mob doesn’t like how accurate the movie is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030022/ | title=Internet Movie Database listing of Crashing Hollywood}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950)&amp;mdash;Actor [[William Holden]] portrays a hack screenwriter forced to collaborate on a screenplay with a desperate, fading [[silent film]] star, played by [[Gloria Swanson]].
*''[[In a Lonely Place]]'' (1950)&amp;mdash;[[Humphrey Bogart]] is a washed up screenwriter who gets framed for murder.
* ''[[Paris, When it Sizzles]]'' (1964)&amp;mdash;[[William Holden]] plays a drunk screenwriter who has wasted months partying and has just two days to finish his script. He hires [[Audrey Hepburn]] to help.
* ''[[Barton Fink]]'' (1991)&amp;mdash;[[John Turturro]] plays a naïve New York playwright who comes to Hollywood with high hopes and great ambition. While there, he meets one of his writing idols, a celebrated novelist from the past who has become a drunken hack screenwriter (a character based on [[William Faulkner]]).
* ''[[Mistress (1992 film)|Mistress]]'' (1992)&amp;mdash;In this comedy written by [[Barry Primus]] and [[J. F. Lawton]], [[Robert Wuhl]] is a screenwriter/director who's got integrity, vision, and a serious script - but no career. [[Martin Landau]] is a sleazy producer who introduces Wuhl to [[Robert De Niro]], [[Danny Aiello]] and [[Eli Wallach]] - three guys willing to invest in the movie, but with one catch: each one wants his mistress to be the star.
* ''[[The Player (film)|The Player]]'' (1992)&amp;mdash;In this satire of the Hollywood system, [[Tim Robbins]] plays a movie producer who thinks he’s being blackmailed by a screenwriter whose script was rejected.
* ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation.]]'' (2002)&amp;mdash;[[Nicolas Cage]] portrays real-life screenwriter [[Charlie Kaufman]] (as well as his fictional brother, Donald) as Kaufman struggles to adapt an esoteric book ([[Susan Orlean]]’s real-life nonfiction work ''[[The Orchid Thief]]'' ) into an action-filled Hollywood screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.chasingthefrog.com/reelfaces/adaptation_intview4.php| title=Interview with Charlie Kaufman| publisher=chasingthefrog.com| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810022733/http://chasingthefrog.com/reelfaces/adaptation_intview4.php| archivedate=2007-08-10| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Dreams on Spec]]'' (2007)&amp;mdash;The only documentary to follow aspiring screenwriters as they struggle to turn their scripts into movies, the film also features wisdom from established scribes like [[James L. Brooks]], [[Nora Ephron]], [[Carrie Fisher]], and [[Gary Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/18/entertainment/et-scriptland18 | title=Producers, writers face huge chasm: Compensation for digital media and residuals for reuse of content are major issues as contract talks begin |journal=Los Angeles Times |date= July 18, 2007 |author=Jay A. Fernandez}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Seven Psychopaths]]'' (2012)&amp;mdash;In this satire, written and directed by [[Martin McDonagh]], [[Colin Farrell]] plays a screenwriter who is struggling to finish his screenplay ''Seven Psychopaths'', but finds unlikely inspiration after his best friend steals a Shih Tzu owned by a vicious gangster.

==Copyright protection==

===United States===
In the [[United States]], completed works may be [[copyright]]ed, but ideas and plots may not be. Any document written after 1978 in the U.S. is automatically copyrighted even without legal [[Register of Copyrights|registration]] or notice. However, the [[Library of Congress]] will formally register a screenplay. U.S. Courts will not accept a lawsuit alleging that a defendant is infringing on the plaintiff's copyright in a work until the plaintiff registers the plaintiff's claim to those copyrights with the Copyright Office.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/411- 17 USC 411 (United States Code, Title 17, Section 411)]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that a plaintiff's attempts to remedy an infringement will be delayed during the registration process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf U.S. Copyright Office Circular 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in many infringement cases, the plaintiff will not be able recoup [[attorney fees]] or collect [[statutory damages for copyright infringement]], unless the plaintiff registered before the infringement began.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/412- 17 USC 412]&lt;/ref&gt; For the purpose of establishing evidence that a screenwriter is the author of a particular screenplay (but not related to the legal copyrighting status of a work), the Writers Guild of America registers screenplays. However, since this service is one of record keeping and is not regulated by law, a variety of commercial and non-profit organizations exist for registering screenplays. Protection for teleplays, formats, as well as screenplays may be registered for instant proof-of-authorship by third-party assurance vendors, such as the [http://www.creatorsvault.com/ Creators Vault].

There is a line of [[precedent]] in several states (including California and New York) that allows for "idea submission" claims, based on the notion that submission of a screenplay (or even a mere pitch for one) to a studio under very particular sets of factual circumstances could potentially give rise to an implied contract to pay for the ideas embedded in that screenplay, even if an alleged derivative work does not actually infringe the screenplay author's copyright.&lt;ref name="Biederman"&gt;{{cite book|title=Law and Business of the Entertainment Industries|date=November 2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275992057|pages=313–327|author=Donald E. Biederman|edition=5th|author2=Edward P. Pierson |author3=Martin E. Silfen |author4=Janna Glasser |author5=Charles J. Biederman |author6=Kenneth J. Abdo |author7=Scott D. Sanders }}&lt;/ref&gt; The unfortunate [[side effect]] of such precedents (which were supposed to protect screenwriters) is that it is now that much harder to break into screenwriting. Naturally, motion picture and television production firms responded by categorically declining to read ''all'' unsolicited screenplays from unknown writers;&lt;ref name="Rosman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosman|first1=Kathleen|title=The Death of the Slush Pile|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703414504575001271351446274|accessdate=27 January 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company|date=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; accepting screenplays only through official channels like talent agents, managers, and attorneys; and forcing screenwriters to sign broad [[legal release]]s before their screenplays will be actually accepted, read, or considered.&lt;ref name="Biederman" /&gt; In turn, agents, managers, and attorneys have become extremely powerful gatekeepers on behalf of the major film studios and media networks.&lt;ref name="Rosman" /&gt; One symptom of how hard it is to break into screenwriting as a result of such case law is that in 2008, [[Universal Studios]] resisted construction of a bike path along the [[Los Angeles River]] next to its studio lot because it would worsen their existing problem with desperate amateur screenwriters throwing copies of their work over the studio wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hymon|first1=Steve|author2=Andrew Blankstein|title=Studio poses obstacle to riverfront bike path|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-bikelane27feb27-story.html|accessdate=27 January 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|date=27 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Simulacra and Simulation'' is most known for its discussion of symbols, signs, and how they relate to contemporaneity (simultaneous existences). Baudrillard claims that our current [[society]] has replaced all reality and meaning with [[symbol]]s and [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]], and that human experience is a simulation of reality. Moreover, these simulacra are not merely mediations of reality, nor even deceptive mediations of reality; they are not based in a reality nor do they hide a reality, they simply hide that nothing like reality is relevant to our current understanding of our lives. The simulacra that Baudrillard refers to are the significations and symbolism of [[culture]] and [[media (communication)|media]] that [[Social constructivism|construct]] perceived reality, the acquired understanding by which our lives and shared existence is and are rendered legible; Baudrillard believed that society has become so saturated with these simulacra and our lives so saturated with the constructs of society that all meaning was being rendered meaningless by being infinitely mutable. Baudrillard called this phenomenon the "precession of simulacra".

== Stages ==
''Simulacra and Simulation'' delineates the sign-order into four stages:
# The first stage is a faithful image/copy, where we believe, and it may even be correct, that a sign is a "reflection of a profound reality" (pg 6), this is a good appearance, in what Baudrillard called "the sacramental order".
# The second stage is perversion of reality, this is where we come to believe the sign to be an unfaithful copy, which "masks and denatures" reality as an "evil appearance—it is of the order of maleficence". Here, signs and images do not faithfully reveal reality to us, but can hint at the existence of an obscure reality which the sign itself is incapable of encapsulating.
# The third stage masks the absence of a profound reality, where the sign ''pretends'' to be a faithful copy, but it is a copy with no original. Signs and images claim to represent something real, but no representation is taking place and arbitrary images are merely suggested as things which they have no relationship to. Baudrillard calls this the "order of sorcery", a regime of [[Semantics|semantic]] algebra where all human meaning is conjured artificially to appear as a reference to the (increasingly) hermetic truth.
# The fourth stage is pure simulacrum, in which the simulacrum has no relationship to any reality whatsoever. Here, signs merely reflect other signs and any claim to reality on the part of images or signs is only of the order of other such claims. This is a regime of total equivalency, where cultural products need no longer even pretend to be real in a naïve sense, because the experiences of consumers' lives are so predominantly artificial that even claims to reality are expected to be phrased in artificial, "[[Hyperreality|hyperreal]]" terms. Any naïve pretension to reality as such is perceived as bereft of critical self-awareness, and thus as oversentimental.
==Degrees==
''Simulacra and Simulation'' identifies three types of simulacra and identifies each with a historical period:
# First order, associated with the premodern period, where representation is clearly an artificial placemarker for the real item. The uniqueness of objects and situations marks them as irreproducibly real and signification obviously gropes towards this reality.
# Second order, associated with the [[modernity]] of the [[Industrial Revolution]], where distinctions between representation and reality break down due to the proliferation of [[mass production|mass-reproducible]] copies of items, turning them into commodities.  The commodity's ability to imitate reality threatens to replace the authority of the original version, because the copy is just as "real" as its [[prototype]].
# Third order, associated with the [[postmodernity]] of [[Late Capitalism]], where the simulacrum precedes the original and the distinction between reality and representation vanishes. There is only the simulation, and originality becomes a totally meaningless concept.&lt;ref name="PH"&gt;{{cite book

==Phenomena==
Baudrillard theorizes that the lack of distinctions between reality and simulacra originates in several phenomena:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

# Contemporary media including [[television]], [[film]], [[printing|print]], and the [[Internet]], which are responsible for blurring the line between products that are needed (in order to live a life) and products for which a need is created by commercial images.
# [[Exchange value]], in which the value of goods is based on money (literally [[denomination (money)|denominated]] [[fiat money|fiat currency]])  rather than usefulness, and moreover usefulness comes to be quantified and defined in monetary terms in order to assist exchange.
# Multinational [[capitalism]], which separates produced goods from the plants, minerals and other original materials and the processes (including the people and their cultural context) used to create them.
# [[Urbanization]], which separates humans from the [[Nature|nonhuman world]], and re-centres culture around productive [[throughput (business)|throughput]] systems so large they cause [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]].
# Language and ideology, in which language increasingly becomes caught up in the production of power relations between social groups, especially when powerful groups institute themselves at least partly in monetary terms.
==Analogies==
A specific analogy that Baudrillard uses is a fable derived from "[[On Exactitude in Science]]" by [[Jorge Luis Borges]]. In it, a great Empire created a map that was so detailed it was as large as the Empire itself. The actual map was expanded and destroyed as the Empire itself conquered or lost territory. When the Empire crumbled, all that was left was the map. In Baudrillard's rendition, it is conversely the map that people live in, the simulation of reality where the people of Empire spend their lives ensuring their place in the representation is properly circumscribed and detailed by the map-makers; conversely, it is reality that is crumbling away from disuse.

:''The transition from signs which dissimulate something to signs which dissimulate that there is nothing, marks the decisive turning point. The first implies a theology of truth and secrecy (to which the notion of ideology still belongs). The second inaugurates an age of simulacra and simulation, in which there is no longer any God to recognize his own, nor any last judgment to separate truth from false, the real from its artificial resurrection, since everything is already dead and risen in advance.''&lt;ref name="PH" /&gt;

When Baudrillard refers to the "precession of simulacra" in ''Simulacra and Simulation'', he is referring to the way simulacra have come to ''precede'' the real in the sense mentioned above, rather than to any ''succession'' of historical phases of the image. Referring to "On Exactitude in Science", he argued that just as for contemporary society the simulated copy had superseded the original object, so, too, the map had come to precede the geographic territory (c.f. [[Map–territory relation]]), e.g. the [[Gulf War|first Gulf War]] (which Baudrillard later used as an object demonstration): the image of war preceded real war. War comes not when it is made by sovereign against sovereign (not when killing for attritive and strategic neutralisation purposes is authorised; nor even, properly spoken, when shots are fired); rather, war comes when society is generally convinced that it is coming.

:''Henceforth, it is the map that precedes the territory—precession of simulacra—it is the map that engenders the territory and if we were to revive the fable today, it would be the territory whose shreds are slowly rotting across the map.''&lt;ref name="PH" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25877">'''Sociotechnical  systems''' ('''STS''') in [[organizational development]] is an approach to complex organizational [[work design]] that recognizes the interaction between [[people]] and [[technology]] in [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]]s. The term also refers to the interaction between society's complex infrastructures and human behaviour. In this sense, society itself, and most of its substructures, are complex sociotechnical systems. The term sociotechnical systems was coined by [[Eric Trist]], Ken Bamforth and [[Fred Emery]], in the World War II era, based on their work with workers in English coal mines at the [[Tavistock Institute]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Susan Long|title=Socioanalytic Methods: Discovering the Hidden in Organisations and Social Systems|isbn=1780491328}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sociotechnical systems pertains to theory regarding the social aspects of [[people]] and [[society]] and technical aspects of organizational structure and processes. Here, technical does not necessarily imply material technology. The focus is on procedures and related knowledge, i.e. it refers to the ancient Greek term ''[[techne]]''. "Technical" is a term used to refer to structure and a broader sense of technicalities.  Sociotechnical refers to the interrelatedness of ''social'' and ''technical'' aspects of an [[organization]] or the [[society]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;For the latter, see the use of ''sociotechnical'' in the works of sociologist [[Niklas Luhmann]] and philosopher [[Günter Ropohl]].&lt;/ref&gt; Sociotechnical theory therefore is about ''joint optimization'', with a shared emphasis on achievement of both excellence in technical performance and quality in people's work lives.  Sociotechnical theory, as distinct from sociotechnical systems, proposes a number of different ways of achieving joint optimisation. They are usually based on designing different kinds of organisation, ones in which the relationships between socio and technical elements lead to the emergence of productivity and wellbeing.

==Overview==
Sociotechnical refers to the interrelatedness of ''social'' and ''technical'' aspects of an [[organization]].  Sociotechnical theory is founded on two main principles:
* One is that the [[Social interaction|interaction]] of social and technical factors creates the conditions for successful (or unsuccessful) organizational [[performance]].  This interaction consists partly of [[linear]] "cause and effect" relationships (the relationships that are normally "designed") and partly from "[[non-linear]]", [[Complexity|complex]], even unpredictable relationships (the good or bad relationships that are often unexpected).  Whether designed or not, both types of interaction occur when socio and technical elements are put to work.
* The corollary of this, and the second of the two main principles, is that optimization of each aspect alone (socio or technical) tends to increase not only the quantity of unpredictable, "un-designed" relationships, but those relationships that are injurious to the system's performance.

Therefore, sociotechnical theory is about ''joint optimization'',&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, R., &amp; Foster, M. (1971). Sociotechical systems. American Psychologist, 26, 467-474. &lt;/ref&gt; that is, designing the social system and technical system in tandem so that they work smoothly together.  Sociotechnical theory, as distinct from sociotechnical systems, proposes a number of different ways of achieving joint optimization. They are usually based on designing different kinds of organization, ones in which the relationships between socio and technical elements lead to the emergence of productivity and wellbeing, rather than the all too often case of new technology failing to meet the expectations of designers and users alike.

The scientific literature shows terms like ''sociotechnical'' all one word, or ''socio-technical'' with a hyphen, ''sociotechnical theory'', ''sociotechnical system'' and ''sociotechnical systems theory''. All of these terms appear ubiquitously but their actual meanings often remain unclear. The key term "sociotechnical" is something of a [[buzzword]] and its varied usage can be unpicked.  What can be said about it, though, is that it is most often used to simply, and quite correctly, describe any kind of organization that is composed of people and technology. But, predictably, there is more to it than that.

==Principles==
Some of the central principles of sociotechnical theory were elaborated in a seminal paper by [[Eric Trist]] and [[Ken Bamforth]] in 1951{{Human Relations; Feb1951, Vol. 4 Issue 1, p3-38, 36p}}. This is an interesting case study which, like most of the work in sociotechnical theory, is focused on a form of 'production system' expressive of the era and the contemporary technological systems it contained.  The study was based on the paradoxical observation that despite improved technology, productivity was falling, and that despite better pay and amenities, absenteeism was increasing.  This particular rational organisation had become irrational.  The cause of the problem was hypothesized to be the adoption of a new form of production technology which had created the need for a bureaucratic form of organization (rather like classic command-and-control).  In this specific example, technology brought with it a retrograde step in organizational design terms.  The analysis that followed introduced the terms "socio" and "technical" and elaborated on many of the core principles that sociotechnical theory subsequently became.

===Responsible autonomy===
Sociotechnical theory was pioneering for its shift in emphasis, a shift towards considering teams or groups as the primary unit of analysis and not the individual.  Sociotechnical theory pays particular attention to internal supervision and leadership at the level of the "group" and refers to it as "responsible autonomy".&lt;ref name="ET51p6-9"&gt;[[Eric Trist]] &amp; K. Bamforth (1951). ''Some social and psychological consequences of the longwall method of coal getting'', in: Human Relations, 4, pp.3-38. p.7-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The overriding point seems to be that having the simple ability of individual team members being able to perform their function is not the only predictor of group effectiveness.  There are a range of issues in team cohesion research, for example, that are answered by having the regulation and leadership internal to a group or team.&lt;ref&gt;Siebold, G. L. (1991). "The evolution of the measurement of cohesion". In: ''Military Psychology'', 11(1), 5-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

These, and other factors, play an integral and parallel role in ensuring successful teamwork which sociotechnical theory exploits.
The idea of semi-autonomous groups conveys a number of further advantages.  Not least among these, especially in hazardous environments, is the often felt need on the part of people in the organisation for a role in a small primary group.  It is argued that such a need arises in cases where the means for effective communication are often somewhat limited.  As Carvalho&lt;ref&gt;P.V.R. Carvalho (2006). "Ergonomic field studies in a nuclear power plant control room". In: ''Progress in Nuclear Energy'', 48, pp. 51-69&lt;/ref&gt;  states, this is because "...operators use verbal exchanges to produce continuous, redundant and recursive interactions to successfully construct and maintain individual and mutual awareness...". The immediacy and proximity of trusted team members makes it possible for this to occur. The [[coevolution]] of technology and organizations brings with it an expanding array of new possibilities for novel interaction.  Responsible autonomy could become more distributed along with the team(s) themselves.

The key to responsible autonomy seems to be to design an organization possessing the characteristics of small groups whilst preventing the "silo-thinking" and "stovepipe" neologisms of contemporary management theory.  In order to preserve "...intact the loyalties on which the small group [depend]...the system as a whole [needs to contain] its bad in a way that [does] not destroy its good".&lt;ref name="ET51p6-9"/&gt; In practice,&lt;ref&gt;A. Rice (1958). ''Productivity and social organisation: The Ahmedabad experiment''.  London: Tavistock.&lt;/ref&gt; this requires groups to be responsible for their own internal regulation and supervision, with the primary task of relating the group to the wider system falling explicitly to a group leader.  This principle, therefore, describes a strategy for removing more traditional command hierarchies.

===Adaptability===
Carvajal&lt;ref&gt;R. Carvajal (1983). "Systemic netfields: the systems' paradigm crises. Part I". In: ''Human Relations'' 36(3), pp.227-246.&lt;/ref&gt; states that "the rate at which uncertainty overwhelms an organisation is related more to its internal structure than to the amount of environmental uncertainty". Sitter in 1997 offered two solutions for organisations confronted, like the military, with an environment of increased (and increasing) complexity:
"The first option is to restore the fit with the external complexity by an increasing internal complexity. ...This usually means the creation of more staff functions or the enlargement of staff-functions and/or the investment in vertical information systems".&lt;ref&gt;Sitter, L. U., Hertog, J. F. &amp; Dankbaar, B., ''From complex organizations with simple jobs to simple organizations with complex jobs'', in: Human Relations, 50(5), 497-536, 1997. p. 498&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical information systems are often confused for "network enabled capability" systems (NEC) but an important distinction needs to be made, which Sitter et al. propose as their second option:
"...the organisation tries to deal with the external complexity by 'reducing' the internal control and coordination needs. ...This option might be called the strategy of 'simple organisations and complex jobs'". This all contributes to a number of unique advantages.
Firstly is the issue of "human redundancy"&lt;ref&gt;D.M. Clark (2005). "Human redundancy in complex, hazardous systems: A theoretical framework". In: ''Safety Science''. Vol 43. pp. 655-677.&lt;/ref&gt;  in which "groups of this kind were free to set their own targets, so that aspiration levels with respect to production could be adjusted to the age and stamina of the individuals concerned".&lt;ref name="ET51p6-9"/&gt; Human redundancy speaks towards the flexibility, ubiquity and pervasiveness of resources within NEC.

The second issue is that of [[complexity]]. Complexity lies at the heart of many organisational contexts (there are numerous organizational paradigms that struggle to cope with it).  Trist and Bamforth (1951) could have been writing about these with the following passage: "A very large variety of unfavourable and changing environmental conditions is encountered ... many of which are impossible to predict.  Others, though predictable, are impossible to alter."&lt;ref name="ET51p20-21"&gt;[[Eric Trist]] &amp; K. Bamforth (1951). ''Some social and psychological consequences of the longwall method of coal getting'', in: Human Relations, 4, pp.3-38. p.20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many type of organisations are clearly motivated by the appealing "industrial age", rational principles of "factory production", a particular approach to dealing with complexity: "In the factory a comparatively high degree of control can be exercised over the complex and moving "figure" of a production sequence, since it is possible to maintain the "ground" in a comparatively passive and constant state".&lt;ref name="ET51p20-21"/&gt; On the other hand, many activities are constantly faced with the possibility of "untoward activity in the 'ground'" of the 'figure-ground' relationship"&lt;ref name="ET51p20-21"/&gt; The central problem, one that appears to be at the nub of many problems that "classic" organisations have with complexity, is that "The instability of the 'ground' limits the applicability ... of methods derived from the factory".&lt;ref name="ET51p20-21"/&gt;

In Classic organisations, problems with the moving "figure" and moving "ground" often become magnified through a much larger social space, one in which there is a far greater extent of hierarchical task interdependence.&lt;ref name="ET51p20-21"/&gt;  For this reason, the semi-autonomous group, and its ability to make a much more fine grained response to the "ground" situation, can be regarded as "agile".  Added to which, local problems that do arise need not propagate throughout the entire system (to affect the workload and quality of work of many others) because a complex organization doing simple tasks has been replaced by a simpler organization doing more complex tasks.  The agility and internal regulation of the group allows problems to be solved locally without propagation through a larger social space, thus increasing tempo.

===Whole tasks===
Another concept in sociotechnical theory is the "whole task".  A whole task "has the advantage of placing responsibility for the ... task squarely on the shoulders of a single, small, face-to-face group which experiences the entire cycle of operations within the compass of its membership."&lt;ref name="ET51p6-9"/&gt; The Sociotechnical embodiment of this principle is the notion of minimal critical specification.  This principle states that, "While it may be necessary to be quite precise about what has to be done, it is rarely necessary to be precise about how it is done".&lt;ref&gt;A. Cherns (1976). "The principles of sociotechnical design". In: ''Human Relations''. Vol 29(8), pp.783-792. p.786&lt;/ref&gt;  This is no more illustrated by the antithetical example of "working to rule" and the virtual collapse of any system that is subject to the intentional withdrawal of human adaptation to situations and contexts.

The key factor in minimally critically specifying tasks is the responsible autonomy of the group to decide, based on local conditions, how best to undertake the task in a flexible adaptive manner. This principle is isomorphic with ideas like [[effects-based operations]] (EBO). EBO asks the question of what goal is it that we want to achieve, what objective is it that we need to reach rather than what tasks have to be undertaken, when and how. The EBO concept enables the managers to "...manipulate and decompose high level effects. They must then assign lesser effects as objectives for subordinates to achieve. The intention is that subordinates' actions will cumulatively achieve the overall effects desired".&lt;ref&gt;J. Storr (2005). ''A critique of effects-based thinking''. RUSI Journal, 2005. p.33&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the focus shifts from being a scriptwriter for tasks to instead being a designer of behaviours. In some cases, this can make the task of the manager significantly less arduous.

===Meaningfulness of tasks===
Effects-based operations and the notion of a "whole task", combined with adaptability and responsible autonomy, have additional advantages for those at work in the organization.  This is because "for each participant the task has total significance and dynamic closure"&lt;ref name="ET51p6-9"/&gt; as well as the requirement to deploy a multiplicity of skills and to have the responsible autonomy in order to select when and how to do so.  This is clearly hinting at a relaxation of the myriad of control mechanisms found in more classically designed organizations.

Greater interdependence (through diffuse processes such as globalisation) also bring with them an issue of size, in which "the scale of a task transcends the limits of simple [[spatio-temporal pattern|spatio-temporal structure]].  By this is meant conditions under which those concerned can complete a job in one place at one time, i.e., the situation of the face-to-face, or singular group". In other words, in classic organisations the "wholeness" of a task is often diminished by multiple group integration and spatiotemporal disintegration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Trist]] &amp; K. Bamforth (1951). ''Some social and psychological consequences of the longwall method of coal getting'', in: Human Relations, 4, pp.3-38. p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; The group based form of organization design proposed by sociotechnical theory combined with new technological possibilities (such as the internet) provide a response to this often forgotten issue, one that contributes significantly to joint optimisation.

==Topics==
===Sociotechnical system===
A sociotechnical system is the term usually given to any instantiation of socio and technical elements engaged in goal directed behaviour. Sociotechnical systems are a particular expression of sociotechnical theory, although they are not necessarily one and the same thing. Sociotechnical systems theory is a mixture of sociotechnical theory, joint optimisation and so forth and general systems theory. The term sociotechnical [[system]] recognises that organizations have boundaries and that transactions occur within the system (and its sub-systems) and between the wider context and dynamics of the environment. It is an extension of Sociotechnical Theory which provides a richer descriptive and conceptual language for describing, analysing and designing organisations.  A Sociotechnical System, therefore, often describes a 'thing' (an interlinked, systems based mixture of people, technology and their environment) .

===Autonomous work teams===

Autonomous work teams also called self-managed teams, are an alternative to traditional assembly line methods. Rather than having a large number of employees each do a small operation to assemble a product, the employees are organized into small teams, each of which is responsible for assembling an entire product. These teams are self-managed, and are independent of one another.&lt;ref&gt;Hackman, J. R., &amp; Oldham, G. R. (1980). Work redesign. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Job enrichment===
[[Job enrichment]] in organizational development, human resources management, and [[organizational behavior]], is the process of giving the employee a wider and higher level scope of responsibility with increased decision-making authority. This is the opposite of job enlargement, which simply would not involve greater authority.  Instead, it will only have an increased number of duties.&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Steers and Lyman W. Porte, ''Motivation and Work Behavior'', 1991. pages 215, 322, 357, 411-413, 423, 428-441 and 576.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Job enlargement===
[[Job enlargement]] means increasing the scope of a [[Job (role)|job]] through extending the range of its job duties and [[Moral responsibility|responsibilities]]. This contradicts the principles of [[Departmentalization|specialisation]] and the [[division of labour]] whereby work is divided into small units, each of which is performed repetitively by an individual worker. Some motivational theories suggest that the boredom and alienation caused by the division of labour can actually cause efficiency to fall.

===Job rotation===
[[Job rotation]] is an approach to management development, where an individual is moved through a schedule of assignments designed to give him or her a breadth of exposure to the entire operation. Job rotation is also practiced to allow qualified employees to gain more insights into the processes of a company and to increase job satisfaction through job variation. The term job rotation can also mean the scheduled exchange of persons in offices, especially in public offices, prior to the end of incumbency or the legislative period. This has been practiced by the [[German green party]] for some time but has been discontinued

===Motivation===
[[Motivation]] in psychology refers to the initiation, direction, intensity and persistence of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Geen, R. G.  (1995), Human motivation: A social psychological approach. Belmont, CA: Cole.&lt;/ref&gt; Motivation is a temporal and dynamic state that should not be confused with personality or emotion.  Motivation is having the desire and willingness to do something. A motivated person can be reaching for a long-term goal such as becoming a professional writer or a more short-term goal like learning how to spell a particular word. Personality invariably refers to more or less permanent characteristics of an individual's state of being (e.g., shy, extrovert, conscientious). As opposed to motivation, emotion refers to temporal states that do not immediately link to behavior (e.g., anger, grief, happiness).

===Process improvement===
Process improvement in organizational development is a series of actions taken to identify, analyze and improve existing processes within an [[organization]] to meet new [[goal]]s and objectives. These actions often follow a specific [[methodology]] or [[strategy]] to create successful results.

===Task analysis===
[[Task analysis]] is the analysis of how a task is accomplished, including a detailed description of both manual and mental activities, task and element durations, task frequency, task allocation, task complexity, environmental conditions, necessary clothing and equipment, and any other unique factors involved in or required for one or more people to perform a given task. This information can then be used for many purposes, such as [[personnel selection]] and [[training]], tool or equipment design, [[Procedure (term)|procedure]] design (e.g., design of [[checklist]]s or [[decision support systems]]) and [[automation]].

===Job design===
[[Job design]] or work design in organizational development is the application of sociotechnical systems principles and techniques to the humanization of work, for example, through [[job enrichment]]. The aims of work design to improved job satisfaction, to improved through-put, to improved quality and to reduced employee problems, e.g., grievances, absenteeism.

===Deliberations===
[[Deliberations]] are key units of analysis in non-linear, knowledge work. They are 'choice points' that move knowledge work forward. As originated and defined by Cal Pava (1983) in a second-generation development of STS theory, deliberations are patterns of exchange and communication to reduce the equivocality of a problematic issue; for example, for systems engineering work, what features to develop in new software. Deliberations are not discrete decisions--they are a more continuous context for decisions. They have 3 aspects: topics, forums, and participants.

'''''Solar Collector''''' is an [[interactive art|interactive]] [[light art]] installation in [[Cambridge, Ontario]], [[Canada]]. It was commissioned by the [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo|Region of Waterloo]] and designed by [[Gorbet Design Inc.]]  The sculpture consists of twelve [[aluminum]] shafts lined with [[solar panel]]s and high-intensity [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]]. Each shaft is arranged to optimize its exposure to the [[sun]] at a particular time of year.  The shortest, most acutely angled shaft is perpendicular to the sun at the [[Summer solstice]] (June 21) and the tallest shaft is perpendicular to the sun at the [[Winter solstice]] (December 21). Energy collected and stored during the day powers a nightly show.  The general public interacts with the sculpture via its website where they design patterns and routines for the LEDs which are combined to create the nightly shows.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4929">{{about|the sociological concept|the mathematical term|Symbolic power of a prime ideal}}
The concept of '''symbolic power''' was first introduced by French sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] to account for the tacit, almost unconscious modes of cultural/social domination occurring within the everyday social habits maintained over conscious subjects. Symbolic power accounts for discipline used against another to confirm that individual's placement in a [[Social stratification|social hierarchy]], at times in individual relations but most basically through system institutions, in particular [[education]].

Also referred to as "soft [[Power (social and political)|power]]", symbolic power includes actions that have discriminatory or injurious meaning or implications, such as gender dominance and racism. Symbolic power maintains its effect through the mis-recognition of power relations situated in the social matrix of a given [[Field (Bourdieu)|field]]. While symbolic power requires a dominator, it also requires the dominated to accept their position in the exchange of social value that occurs between them.

==History==
The concept of symbolic power may be seen as grounded in [[Friedrich Engels]]' concept of [[false consciousness]]. To Engels, under capitalism, objects and social relationships themselves are embedded with societal value that is dependent upon the actors who engage in interactions themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter to Mehring|year=1893|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1893/letters/93_07_14.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the illusion of natural law governing such transactions of social and physical worth, the proletariat would be unwilling to consciously support social relations that counteract their own interests. Dominant actors in a society must consciously accept that such an ideological order exists for unequal social relationships to take place. [[Louis Althusser]] further developed it in his writing on what he called Ideological State Apparatuses, arguing that the latter's power is partly based on symbolic repression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Althusser, Louis|contribution=Ideology and Ideological State Apparatus|editor=Althusser, Louis|title=Lenin and Philosophy, and Other Essays|location=New York|publisher=Monthly Review Press|year=1972|p=145ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of symbolic power was first introduced by [[Pierre Bourdieu]] in ''[[La Distinction]]''. Bourdieu suggested that cultural roles are more dominant than economic forces in determining how hierarchies of power are situated and reproduced across societies. Status and economic capital are both necessary to maintain dominance in a system, rather than just ownership over the means of production alone. The idea that one could possess [[symbolic capital]] in addition and set apart from financial capital played a critical role in Bourdieu's analysis of hierarchies of power.

For example, in the process of reciprocal gift exchange in the Kabyle society of Algeria, where there is asymmetry in wealth between the two parties the better endowed giver "can impose a strict relation of hierarchy and debt upon the receiver."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bourdieu in Algeria: Colonial Politics, Ethnographic Practices, Theoretical Developments|author=Jane Goodman|year=2009|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&amp;context=unpresssamples}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolic power, therefore, is fundamentally the imposition of categories of thought and perception upon dominated social agents who, once they begin observing and evaluating the world in terms of those categories—and without necessarily being aware of the change in their perspective—then perceive the existing [[social order]] as just. This, in turn, perpetuates a [[social structure]] favored by and serving the interests of those agents who are already dominant.&lt;ref name="Cattani2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cattani, Gino|author2=Ferriani, Simone|author3=Allison, Paul|year=2014|title=Insiders, Outsiders and the Struggle for Consecration in Cultural Fields: A Core-Periphery Perspective|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=79|issue=|pages=258–281|doi=10.1177/0003122414520960|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByE7rCUuloTlZm9LLW9adXRXMFE/edit?usp=sharing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolic power, if real, is in some senses much more powerful than physical violence in that it is embedded in the very modes of action and structures of cognition of individuals, and imposes the specter of legitimacy of the social order.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5568">'''System of systems engineering''' ('''SoSE''') is a set of developing processes, tools, and methods for designing, re-designing and deploying solutions to [[System of systems|system-of-systems]] challenges.

== Overview ==
System of Systems Engineering (SoSE) methodology is heavily used in [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] applications, but is increasingly being applied to non-defense related problems such as architectural design of problems in air and auto transportation, healthcare, global communication networks, search and rescue, space exploration and many other System of Systems application domains.  SoSE is more than [[systems engineering]] of monolithic, [[complexity|complex systems]] because design for System-of-Systems problems is performed under some level of uncertainty in the requirements and the constituent systems, and it involves considerations in multiple levels and domains (as per &lt;ref&gt;Daniel DeLaurentis, "Understanding Transportation as a System-of-Systems Design Problem," 43rd AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Reno, Nevada, January 10–13, 2005. AIAA-2005-0123.&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;Daniel DeLaurentis, Oleg Sindiy, William Stein, "Developing Sustainable Space Exploration via a System-of-Systems Approach," AIAA Space 2006 Conference, San Jose, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;). Whereas systems engineering focuses on building the system right, SoSE focuses on choosing the right system(s) and their interactions to satisfy the requirements.

System-of-Systems Engineering and Systems Engineering are related but different fields of study. Whereas systems engineering addresses the development and operations of monolithic products, SoSE addresses the development and operations of evolving programs. In other words, traditional systems engineering seeks to optimize an individual system (i.e., the product), while SoSE seeks to optimize network of various interacting legacy and new systems brought together to satisfy multiple objectives of the program.  SoSE should enable the decision-makers to understand the implications of various choices on technical performance, costs, extensibility and flexibility over time; thus, effective SoSE methodology should prepare decision-makers to design informed architectural solutions for [[System of systems|System-of-Systems]] problems.

Due to varied methodology and domains of applications in existing literature, there does not exist a single unified consensus for processes involved in System-of-Systems Engineering.  One of the proposed SoSE frameworks, by Dr. Daniel A. DeLaurentis, recommends a three-phase method where a SoS problem is defined (understood), abstracted, modeled and analyzed for behavioral patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel DeLaurentis, Oleg Sindiy, William Stein, "Developing Sustainable Space Exploration via a System-of-Systems Approach," AIAA Space 2006 Conference, San Jose, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;  More information on this method and other proposed methods can be found in the listed SoSE focused organizations and SoSE literature in the subsequent sections.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1567">In [[type theory]], a branch of [[mathematical logic]], in a given typed calculus, the '''type inhabitation problem''' for this calculus is the following problem:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Inhabitation in Typed Lambda-Calculi (A Syntactic Approach) |author=Pawel Urzyczyn |journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |pages=373–389 |year=1997 |publisher=Springer |url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/tg515q64xn434l70.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; given a type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; and a [[typing environment]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, does there exist a &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-term M such that &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash M : \tau&lt;/math&gt;? With an empty type environment, such an M is said to be an inhabitant of &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.

== Relationship to logic ==

In the case of [[simply typed lambda calculus]], a type has an inhabitant if and only if its [[Curry-Howard|corresponding]] proposition is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] of minimal implicative logic. Similarly, a [[System F]] type has an inhabitant if and only if its [[Curry-Howard|corresponding]] proposition is a tautology of [[second-order logic]].

== Formal properties ==

For most typed calculi, the type inhabitation problem is very [[PSPACE-hard|hard]]. [[Richard Statman]] proved that for [[simply typed lambda calculus]] the type inhabitation problem is [[PSPACE-complete]]. For other calculi, like [[System F]], the problem is even [[decision problem|undecidable]].

The '''World Conference on Human Rights''' was held by the United Nations in Vienna, Austria, on 14 to 25 June 1993.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"&gt;{{cite book | last=Norchi | first=Charles | chapter=Human Rights: A Global Common Interest | editor=Krasno, Jean E. | title=The United Nations: Confronting the Challenges of a Global Society | publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]] | year=2004 | isbn=1-58826-280-4 | page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first human rights conference held since the end of the [[Cold War]].  The main result of the conference was the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]].

==Background==
Although the United Nations had long been active in the field of human rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/humanrightsun/2008/12/20081278493266190.html | title=Timeline: Human Rights Conventions | publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] | accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Vienna conference was only the second global conference to focus exclusively on human rights, with the first having been the [[International Conference on Human Rights]] held in [[Teheran]], [[Iran]], during April–May 1968 to mark the twentieth anniversary of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="boyle-79"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/l2ptichr.htm | title=Proclamation of Tehran, Final Act of the International Conference on Human Rights, Teheran, 22 April to 13 May 1968 | publisher=U.N. Doc. A/CONF. 32/41 at 3 (1968) via [[University of Minnesota]] Human Rights Library | accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vienna conference came at a time when world conferences were popular, with the [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] having been held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, in June 1992, and the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], soon following in September 1994.&lt;ref name="boyle-79"/&gt; More conferences would follow after that, including the [[Commission for Social Development|World Summit for Social Development]] in Copenhagen, Denmark, in March 1995 and the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in Beijing, China, in September 1995.  Such conferences were seen as a way to promote global participation, consultation, and policy formation, and were seen as a likely significant new way to influence the direction of international society.&lt;ref name="boyle-79"/&gt;

The notion of having a world conference on human rights was first proposed in 1989.&lt;ref name="boyle-79"/&gt; The end of the [[Cold War]] brought about the hope that the long stalemate and distortion of United Nations behaviors due to the bipolar superpower confrontation would cease.&lt;ref name="boyle-79"/&gt;  

In the run-up to the 1993 conference, much of the optimism of the 1989 era was lost.&lt;ref name="boyle-80"/&gt; Preparatory conferences were held in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, beginning in 1991, as were a number of regional and satellite meetings.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boyle-80"/&gt; These struggled to produce new ideas that countries could agree upon,&lt;ref name="nyt042593"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/world/a-bleak-assessment-as-rights-meeting-nears.html | title=A Bleak Assessment as Rights Meeting Nears | author=Riding, Alan | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=25 April 1993 | pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and highlighted differences surrounding the role of state sovereignty, [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs), and whether new or strengthened human rights instruments for the UN were feasible and impartial.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"/&gt; The [[United Nations General Assembly]] was eventually forced to decide upon the conference's agenda in 1992.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boyle-80"/&gt; [[Pierre Sané]], the Secretary General of [[Amnesty International]], was concerned that conference might represent a backwards step for human rights.&lt;ref name="nyt042593"/&gt; He added, "It's not surprising that governments are not overenthusiastic. After all, they are the ones violating human rights."&lt;ref name="nyt042593"/&gt;

==Conference==
The World Conference on Human Rights was attended by representatives of 171 nations and 800 NGOs, with some 7,000 participants overall.&lt;ref name="boyle-79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="norchi-88"/&gt; This made it the largest gathering ever on human rights.&lt;ref name="boyle-79"&gt;{{cite book | last=Boyle | first=Kevin | authorlink=Kevin Boyle (lawyer)| chapter=Stock-Taking on Human Rights: The World Conference on Human Rights, Vienna 1993 | editor=Beetham, David | title=Politics and Human Rights | publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] | year=1995 | isbn=0-631-19666-8 | page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was organised by Human Rights expert John Pace.

There was much discussion ahead of the conference on what could and could not be said during it.  The rules adopted stated that no specific countries or places could be mentioned where human rights abuses were taking place, including those involved in current conflicts such as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Angola]], and [[Liberia]], and those subject to ongoing human rights criticism, such as China and [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="nyt061493"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/14/world/a-rights-meeting-but-don-t-mention-the-wronged.html | title=A Rights Meeting, but Don't Mention the Wronged | author=Riding, Alan | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=14 June 1993 | page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boyle-81"&gt;Boyle, "Stock-Taking on Human Rights", p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, human rights abuses were to be discussed in the abstract only; this led ''[[The New York Times]]'' to state that the conference was taking place "In an atmosphere strangely removed from reality."&lt;ref name="nyt061493"/&gt; In particular, that the ongoing [[Bosnian War]] was taking place only an hour's flight from Vienna testified dramatically that no new era of international cooperation had come into place.&lt;ref name="boyle-80"&gt;Boyle, "Stock-Taking on Human Rights", p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the rules, organizations and demonstrators at the conference's physical site were happy to mention specific ongoing abuses all around the world, with many displaying atrocity photographs in an attempt to out-do each other.&lt;ref name="nyt061693"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/16/world/women-seize-focus-at-rights-forum.html | title=Women Seize Focus at Rights Forum | author=Riding, Alan | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=16 June 1993 | page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt; One person concerned about the [[Polisario Front]] and [[Western Sahara]] situation said, "It's hard to be noticed."&lt;ref name="nyt061693"/&gt;

The conference did have an expansive view of human rights, with efforts made to highlight [[women's rights]], [[indigenous peoples]]' rights, [[minority rights]], and more in the context of universal political and economic rights.&lt;ref name="nyt061493"/&gt; Women's rights in particular gained a strong and effective presence at the conference.&lt;ref name="nyt061693"/&gt;

One fault line at the conference was Western nations who proclaimed a [[moral universalism|universal meaning]] to human rights versus nations who said that human rights needed to be interpreted differently in non-Western cultures and that attempts to impose a universal definition amounted to interference in their internal affairs.&lt;ref name="nyt061493"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt061593"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/15/world/us-rejects-notion-that-human-rights-vary-with-culture.html | title=U.S. Rejects Notion That Human Rights Vary With Culture | author=Sciolino, Elaine | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=15 June 1993 | page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter group was led by China, [[Syria]] and [[Iran]], and also included a number of Asian nations such as Singapore, [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="nyt061593"/&gt; On the opening day of the conference, U.S. Secretary of State [[Warren Christopher]] spoke out strongly against this notion, saying "We cannot let [[cultural relativism]] become the last refuge of [[oppression|repression]]."&lt;ref name="nyt061593"/&gt;

Former [[U.S. House of Representatives]] member and vice presidential candidate [[Geraldine Ferraro]] attended the conference as the alternate U.S. delegate,&lt;ref name="fox-bio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,34759,00.html | title=Geraldine Ferraro – Bio | publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] | date=5 September 2003 | accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the attendees heavily interested in women's rights aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/10/opinion/human-rights-for-women.html | title=Human Rights for Women | author=[[Geraldine Ferraro|Ferraro, Geraldine]] | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=10 June 1993 | page=A27 op-ed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of pressures from the People's Republic of China,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/f9e14159ae1b90f8c125690a005ab864?Opendocument Lettre datée du 24 juin 1993, adressée au Président de la Conférence mondiale sur les droits de l'homme par le Chef adjoint de la délégation chinoise]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[14th Dalai Lama]] was able to give a talk at the conference on [[human responsibilities]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre-Antoine Donnet]], ''Tibet mort ou vif'', Édition Gallimard, 1990 ; Nouv. éd. augmentée 1993, {{ISBN|2-07-032802-3}} (''Tibet: Survival in Question'', traduction Tica Broch, Oxford/Zed Books, 1994, {{ISBN|0-19-563573-6}}, {{ISBN|1-85649-130-7}}, {{ISBN|1-85649-129-3}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freetibet.org/about/dalai5 A speech given by His Holiness the Dalai Lama to the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights, Vienna, Austria, June 1993.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action}}
The key result of the World Conference on Human Rights was the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], which was formulated late in the meeting&lt;ref name="boyle-81"/&gt; and was adopted by consensus of 171 states on 25 June 1993.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"/&gt; While one possible interpretation sees this document as a "well crafted but empty exhortation", it did come to represent as much of a consensus as could be found on human rights in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="boyle-81"/&gt; And it did in fact set new marks in human rights work in several areas.  It established the interdependence of democracy, economic development, and human rights.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"/&gt; Specifically, it replaced the Cold War division of Civil and Political Rights (CPR) apart from Economic Social and Cultural rights (ESCR) with the concept of rights being indivisible (you cannot take one type of rights without the other), interdependent (one set of rights needs the other to be realised), and inter-related (that all human rights relate to each other).&lt;ref&gt;[[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], Part I, para 5&lt;/ref&gt; It called for the creation of instruments to publicize and protect the rights of women, children, and indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"/&gt; It requested more funding for the [[United Nations Center for Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="norchi-88"&gt;Norchi, "Human Rights: A Global Common Interest", p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most significantly, it called for a new office, the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="norchi-88"/&gt;

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] subsequently endorsed the declaration as part of Resolution 48/121.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"/&gt; It also created the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on 20 December 1993.

By the early 2000s, all of the explicit establishments recommended by the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action had been met in full or in part.&lt;ref name="norchi-88"/&gt; The conference also highlighted the importance that NGOs would continue to play in the human rights infrastructure.&lt;ref name="norchi-88"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boyle-81"/&gt;
