Governed by the [[Communist Party of China]], the state exercises jurisdiction over 22 [[Provinces of China|provinces]]&lt;!-- these are ONLY the provinces the PRC has jurisdictional control over. It is already mentioned as disputed in the "Administrative divisions" section below. --&gt;, five [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]], four [[Direct-controlled municipalities of China|direct-controlled municipalities]] ([[Beijing]], [[Tianjin]], [[Shanghai]], and [[Chongqing]]), and the [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]].

China emerged as one of the world's [[Cradle of civilization|earliest civilizations]], in the fertile basin of the [[Yellow River]] in the [[North China Plain]]. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasties]], beginning with the semi-legendary [[Xia dynasty]] in 21st century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project]] by People's Republic of China&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, China has [[Dynasties in Chinese history|expanded, fractured, and re-unified]] numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, [[Qin's wars of unification|the Qin unified core China]] and established [[Qin dynasty|the first Chinese empire]]. The succeeding [[Han dynasty]], which ruled from 206 BC until 220 AD, saw some of the [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|most advanced technology]] at that time, including [[papermaking]] and the [[compass]],&lt;ref&gt;Tom (1989), 99; Day &amp; McNeil (1996), 122; Needham (1986e), 1–2, 40–41, 122–123, 228.&lt;/ref&gt; along with agricultural and medical improvements. The invention of [[gunpowder]] and [[movable type]] in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) and [[Northern Song]] (960–1127) completed the [[Four Great Inventions]]. Tang culture spread widely in [[Asia]], as the new [[Silk Road|maritime Silk Route]] brought traders to as far as [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Horn of Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowman|first=John S.|title=Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture|year=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|pages=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the [[Xinhai Revolution]], when a [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|republic]] replaced the [[Qing dynasty]]. The [[Chinese Civil War]] resulted in a division of territory in 1949, when the [[Communist Party of China]] established the People's Republic of China, a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[One-party state|one-party]] [[sovereign state]] on [[Mainland China]], while the [[Kuomintang]]-led government retreated to the island of [[Taiwan]].

The Shang was conquered by the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]], who ruled between the 11th and 5th centuries&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bce}}, though centralized authority was slowly eroded by feudal warlords. Some principalities eventually emerged from the weakened Zhou, no longer fully obeyed the Zhou king and continually waged war with each other in the 300-year [[Spring and Autumn period]]. By the time of the [[Warring States period]] of the 5th–3rd centuries&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bce}}, there were seven powerful sovereign states in what is now China, each with its own king, ministry and army.

The [[Warring States period]] ended in 221&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bce}} after the [[Qin (state)|state of Qin]] conquered the other six kingdoms, reunited China and established the dominant order of totalitarian autocracy. [[King Zheng of Qin]] proclaimed himself the [[First Emperor]] of the [[Qin dynasty]].

Between the 10th and 11th centuries, the population of China doubled in size to around 100 million people, mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern China, and the production of abundant food surpluses.

The 13th century brought the [[Mongol conquest of China]]. In 1271, the [[Mongols|Mongol]] leader [[Kublai Khan]] established the [[Yuan dynasty]]; the Yuan conquered the last remnant of the Song dynasty in 1279. Before the Mongol invasion, the population of Song China was 120 million citizens; this was reduced to 60 million by the time of the census in 1300.&lt;ref&gt;Ping-ti Ho.

Under the Ming dynasty, China enjoyed another golden age, developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture. It was during this period that [[Zheng He]] led the [[Ming treasure voyages]] throughout the world, reaching as far as Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/25/kenya-china | work=The Guardian | first=Xan | last=Rice | title=Chinese archaeologists' African quest for sunken ship of Ming admiral | date=25 July 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the Ming dynasty, China's capital was moved from [[Nanjing]] to Beijing. With the budding of capitalism, philosophers such as [[Wang Yangming]] further critiqued and expanded Neo-Confucianism with concepts of [[individualism]] and equality of [[four occupations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wang Yangming (1472—1529)|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/wangyang/|work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=9 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109100108/http://www.iep.utm.edu/wangyang/|archivedate=9 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[scholar-official]] stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements, which, together with the famines and defense against [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)]] and [[Qing conquest of the Ming|Manchu invasions]] led to an exhausted treasury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.docin.com/p-378667223.html |script-title=zh:论明末士人阶层与资本主义萌芽的关系 |website=docin.com |date=8 April 2012 |accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1644, Beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by [[Li Zicheng]]. The [[Chongzhen Emperor]] committed suicide when the city fell. The Manchu [[Qing dynasty]], then allied with Ming dynasty general [[Wu Sangui]], overthrew Li's short-lived [[Shun dynasty]] and subsequently seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty.

The Qing dynasty also began experiencing [[Timeline of late anti-Qing rebellions|internal unrest]] in which tens of millions of people died, especially in the [[White Lotus Rebellion]], the failed [[Taiping Rebellion]] that ravaged southern China in the 1850s and 1860s and the [[Dungan Revolt (1862–77)|Dungan Revolt]] (1862–77) in the northwest.

The ill-fated anti-foreign [[Boxer Rebellion]] of 1899–1901 further weakened the dynasty. Although Cixi sponsored a program of reforms, the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911–12 brought an end to the Qing dynasty and established the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]].

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of China}}
[[File:China Köppen.svg|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification system|Köppen climate types]] of China|alt=|center|500x500px]]
China's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from the [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] and [[Taklamakan Desert]]s in the arid north to [[subtropical]] forests in the wetter south. The [[Himalaya]], [[Karakoram]], [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] and [[Tian Shan]] mountain ranges separate China from much of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Central Asia]]. The [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and [[Yellow River]]s, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, respectively, run from the [[Tibetan Plateau]] to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is {{convert|14500|km|mi|sp=us}} long and is bounded by the [[Bohai Sea|Bohai]], [[Yellow Sea|Yellow]], [[East China Sea|East China]] and [[South China Sea|South China]] seas. China connects through the Kazakh border to the [[Eurasian Steppe]] which has been an artery of communication between East and West since the Neolithic through the [[Steppe Route|Steppe route]] – the ancestor of the terrestrial [[Silk Road UNESCO World Heritage Sites|Silk Road]](s).

The territory of China lies between [[latitude]]s [[18th parallel north|18°]] and [[54th parallel north|54° N]], and [[longitude]]s [[73rd meridian east|73°]] and [[135th meridian east|135° E]]. China's landscapes vary significantly across its vast width. In the east, along the shores of the [[Yellow Sea]] and the [[East China Sea]], there are extensive and densely populated [[alluvium|alluvial plains]], while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, broad [[grassland]]s predominate. Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the [[river delta|deltas]] of China's two major rivers, the [[Yellow River]] and the [[Yangtze River]]. Other major rivers include the [[Xi River|Xi]], [[Mekong]], [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] and [[Amur River|Amur]]. To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas. High [[plateau]]s feature among the more arid landscapes of the north, such as the [[Taklamakan Desert|Taklamakan]] and the [[Gobi Desert]]. The world's highest point, [[Mount Everest]] (8,848m), lies on the Sino-Nepalese border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nepal and China agree on Mount Everest's height|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8608913.stm|newspaper=BBC News|date=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's lowest point, and the world's third-lowest, is the dried lake bed of [[Ayding Lake]] (−154m) in the [[Turpan Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lowest Places on Earth|url=http://www.nps.gov/deva/naturescience/lowest-places-on-earth.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China's climate is mainly dominated by [[dry season]]s and wet [[monsoons]], which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer. In the winter, northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry; in summer, southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Regional Climate Studies of China|year=2008|publisher=Springer|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEO_RyNDJ0gC&amp;pg=PA1|isbn=9783540792420}}&lt;/ref&gt; The climate in China differs from region to region because of the country's highly complex [[topography]].

A major environmental issue in China is the continued [[desertification|expansion of its deserts]], particularly the Gobi Desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fighting Desertification|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/terrywaghorn/2011/03/07/fighting-desertification/|newspaper=Forbes|date=7 March 2011|first=Terry|last=Waghorn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_au"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4915690.stm "Beijing hit by eighth sandstorm"].

In China, heavy metals also cause environmental pollution. Heavy metal pollution is an inorganic chemical hazard, which is mainly caused by lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni). Five metals among them, Pb, Cr, As, Cd, and Hg, are the key heavy metal pollutants in China. Heavy metal pollutants mainly come from mining, sewage irrigation, the manufacturing of metal-containing products, and other related production activities. High level of heavy metal exposure can also cause permanent intellectual and developmental disabilities, including reading and learning disabilities, behavioral problems, hearing loss, attention problems, and disruption in the development of visual and motor function. According to the data of a national census of pollution, China has more than 1.5 million sites of heavy metals exposure. The total volume of discharged heavy metals in the waste water, waste gas and solid wastes are around 900,000 tons each year from 2005–2011.&lt;ref&gt;Hu, Hui, Qian Jin, and Philip Kavan.

====Trade relations====
In recent decades, China has played an increasing role in calling for [[free trade area]]s and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbours. China became a member of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) on 11 December 2001. In 2004, it proposed an entirely new [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues.&lt;ref name="Ref_s"&gt;Dillon, Dana; and Tkacik, John, Jr.; [https://web.archive.org/web/20060210135228/http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html ''China's Quest for Asia''].

Retrieved 22 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The EAS, which includes [[ASEAN Plus Three]], India, Australia and New Zealand, held its inaugural summit in 2005. China is also a founding member of the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]] (SCO), along with Russia and the Central Asian republics.

In 2000, the [[United States Congress]] approved "permanent normal trade relations" (PNTR) with China, allowing Chinese exports in at the same low tariffs as goods from most other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clinton signs China trade bill|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/10/10/clinton.pntr/|publisher=CNN|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505165947/http://transcripts.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/10/10/clinton.pntr/|archivedate=5 May 2009|date=10 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; China has a significant [[trade surplus]] with the United States, its most important export market.&lt;ref name="Ref_w"&gt;"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11544677 US trade gap widens on increased Chinese imports]".

China has the [[World economy|second biggest economy]] in the world. According to [[Bloomberg News]], China is planning to reduce the average tariff rate on imports from its trading partners by October 2018. In July 2018, China had also cut import tariffs on approximately 1,500 consumer products so as to open up the economy of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-tariffs/china-plans-import-tariff-cuts-as-soon-as-october-bloomberg-idUSKCN1M00MU?il=0|title=China plans import tariff cuts as soon as October: Bloomberg|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, the US announced that it would increase tariffs on US$250 billion of goods from China, from 10% to 25%, leading China to also increase tariffs on US$110 billion of products from the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/02/trump-hails-trade-deal-with-china-as-one-of-the-largest-ever-made.html |title=Trump hails trade deal with China as one of the largest ever made December 2, 2018|website=CNBC|date=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early December, however, there was a temporary reprieve in the [[2018 China–United States trade war]]. During a dinner at the [[2018 G20 Buenos Aires summit]], [[Donald Trump]] and Xi Jinping agreed to delay increases in tariffs for 90 days to allow time for negotiations of their trade disputes. "If at the end of that period, the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the 10 percent tariffs will be raised to 25 percent," according to a White House statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46422320 |title=Trump says China agreed to reduce tariffs on US car imports|publisher=BBC|date=December 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sarah Huckabee Sanders]] told the news media that China had agreed to purchase "a very substantial" amount of soy beans and other agricultural, energy, industrial, and other products from the US. A Chinese spokesman provided fewer specifics but said that the "two heads of state reached consensus to halt the mutual increase of new tariffs" and that the country would increase its purchases from the US to "gradually ease the imbalance in two-way trade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/02/donald-trump-and-xi-jinping-declare-trade-truce-at-g20 |title=Donald Trump and Xi Jinping declare trade truce at G20|publisher=The Guardian|date=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:China administrative.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Map depicting territorial disputes between the PRC and neighbouring states. For a larger map, [[Template:PRC provinces big imagemap|see here]].]]
Ever since its establishment after the second [[Chinese Civil War]], the PRC has claimed [[Free area of the Republic of China|the territories]] governed by the [[Republic of China]] (ROC), a separate political entity today commonly known as Taiwan, as a part of its territory. It regards the [[island of Taiwan]] as its [[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|Taiwan Province]], [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] as a part of [[Fujian Province]] and islands the ROC controls in the [[South China Sea]] as a part of [[Hainan Province]] and [[Guangdong Province]]. These claims are controversial because of the complicated [[Cross-Strait relations]], with the PRC treating the [[One-China policy]] as one of its most important diplomatic principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.cultural-china.com/en/34History7320.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130912132339/http://history.cultural-china.com/en/34History7320.html|archivedate=12 September 2013|title=Chinese Civil War|publisher=Cultural-China.com|quote=To this day, since no armistice or peace treaty has ever been signed, there is controversy as to whether the Civil War has legally ended.|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Taiwan, China is also involved in other international territorial disputes. Since the 1990s, China has been involved in negotiations to resolve its disputed land borders, including a [[Sino-Indian border dispute|disputed border with India]] and an undefined border with [[Bhutan]]. China is additionally involved in multilateral disputes over the ownership of several small islands in the East and South China Seas, such as the [[Senkaku Islands dispute|Senkaku Islands]] and the [[Scarborough Shoal standoff|Scarborough Shoal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18045383 "China denies preparing war over South China Sea shoal"].

====Emerging superpower status====
China is regularly hailed as a [[Potential superpowers|potential new superpower]], with certain commentators citing its rapid economic progress, growing military might, very large population, and increasing international influence as signs that it will play a [[Chinese Century|prominent global role]] in the 21st century.&lt;ref name="ChinaFuture"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/18/china-birth-of-superpower|title=China: witnessing the birth of a superpower|work=The Guardian|date=18 June 2012|accessdate=6 March 2013|location=London|first=Jonathan|last=Watts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, warn that [[economic bubbles]] and demographic imbalances could slow or even halt China's growth as the century progresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Chinese democracy movement]], social activists, and some members of the Communist Party of China have all identified the need for social and political reform. While economic and social controls have been significantly relaxed in China since the 1970s, [[political freedom]] is still tightly restricted. The [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] states that the "fundamental rights" of citizens include [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of the press]], the [[right to a fair trial]], [[freedom of religion]], [[universal suffrage]], and [[property|property rights]].

Prisoners are not paid at all, and need their families to send money to them. Prisoners who refuse to work are beaten, and some are beaten to death. Many of the prisoners are political or religious dissidents, and some are recognized internationally as prisoners of conscience. "Laogai" in Chinese means forced labour and reform. A Chinese president said that they want to see two products coming out of the prisons: the man who has been reformed, and the product made by the man. Harry Wu, himself a former prisoner of the Laogai, filmed undercover footage of the Laogai, and was charged with stealing state secrets. For this, Harry Wu was sentenced to 15 years in prison, but only served 66 days before being deported to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prison slaves: China is the world's factory, but does a dark secret lurk behind this apparent success story?|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/slaverya21stcenturyevil/2011/10/2011101091153782814.html|accessdate=13 March 2018|publisher=Al Jazeera English|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBS: 60 minutes Chinese Labor Camps with Harry Wu (1991)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHVZO5PlFTM|website=Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese human rights campaigner Harry Wu dies: A former prisoner of conscience, Wu exposed the brutality of China's prison camps|url=https://www.ucanews.com/news/chinese-human-rights-campaigner-harry-wu-dies/75883|accessdate=13 March 2018|publisher=UCA News|date=April 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic history and growth===
{{main|Economic history of China (1949–present)}}

From its founding in 1949 until late 1978, the People's Republic of China was a Soviet-style centrally [[planned economy]]. Following Mao's death in 1976 and the consequent end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], [[Deng Xiaoping]] and the new Chinese leadership began to [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|reform the economy]] and move towards a more market-oriented [[mixed economy]] under one-party rule. [[Collective farming|Agricultural collectivization]] was dismantled and farmlands privatized, while foreign trade became a major new focus, leading to the creation of [[Special Economic Zone]]s (SEZs). Inefficient [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned enterprises]] (SOEs) were restructured and unprofitable ones were closed outright, resulting in massive job losses. Modern-day China is mainly characterized as having a market economy based on private property ownership,&lt;ref name="english.eastday"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.eastday.com/e/ICS/u1a4035916.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909205947/http://english.eastday.com/e/ICS/u1a4035916.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 9 September 2009 |title=China is already a market economy—Long Yongtu, Secretary General of Boao Forum for Asia |publisher=EastDay.com |year=2008 |accessdate=14 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the leading examples of [[state capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.forbes.com/greatspeculations/2010/03/22/communism-is-dead-but-state-capitalism-thrives/ "Communism Is Dead, But State Capitalism Thrives"].

The [[Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China|national census of 2010]] recorded the population of the People's Republic of China as approximately 1,370,536,875. About 16.60% of the population were 14 years old or younger, 70.14% were between 15 and 59 years old, and 13.26% were over 60 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Communiqué of the National Bureau of Statistics of People's Republic of China on Major Figures of the 2010 Population Census[1] (No. 1)|url=http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/NewsEvents/201104/t20110428_26449.html|publisher=National Bureau of Statistics of China|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population growth rate for 2013 is estimated to be 0.46%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=POPULATION GROWTH RATE|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2002.html|publisher=CIA|accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a middle-income country by Western standards, China's rapid growth has [[Poverty in China|pulled hundreds of millions]] of its people out of poverty since 1978. Today, about 10% of the Chinese population lives below the poverty line of US$1 per day, down from 64% in 1978. In 2014, the urban unemployment rate of China was about 4.1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.cntv.cn/20140124/102623.shtml |title=China´s 2013 urban unemployment rate at 4.1 pct CCTV News – CNTV English |date=27 December 2013 |accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/international/china-s-2013-urban-unemployment-rate-at-4-1-114012400449_1.html |title=China's 2013 urban unemployment rate at 4.1% |publisher=Business Standard |date=24 January 2014 |accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given concerns about population growth, China implemented a two-child limit during the 1970s, and, in 1979, began to advocate for an even stricter limit of one child per family.  Beginning in the mid 1980s, however, given the unpopularity of the strict limits, China began to allow some major exemptions, particularly in rural areas, resulting in what was actually a "1.5"-child policy from the mid 1980s to 2015 (ethnic minorities were also exempt from one child limits).  The next major loosening of the policy was enacted in December 2013, allowing families to have two children if one parent is an only child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China formalizes easing of one-child policy|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/12/28/china-one-child-policy/4230785/|newspaper=USA Today|date=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the one-child policy was replaced in favor of a [[two-child policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-12/27/c_134955448.htm|title=Top legislature amends law to allow all couples to have two children|publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]]| date=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from the 2010 census implies that the [[total fertility rate]] may be around 1.4, although due to underreporting of births it may be closer to 1.5-1.6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18651512 |title=The most surprising demographic crisis |work=The Economist  |date=5 May 2011 |accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these scholars have been challenged.  Their own counterfactual model of fertility decline without such restrictions implies that China averted more than 500 million births between 1970 and 2015, a number which may reach one billion by 2060 given all the lost descendants of births averted during the era of fertility restrictions, with one-child restrictions accounting for the great bulk of that reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goodkind |first1=Daniel |title=The Astonishing Population Averted by China's Birth Restrictions:  Estimates, Nightmares, and Reprogrammed Ambitions |journal=DEMOGRAPHY |date=2017 |volume=1375-1399 |issue=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, the Communist Party started the [[Patriotic Health Campaign]], which was aimed at improving sanitation and hygiene, as well as treating and preventing several diseases. Diseases such as [[cholera]], [[typhoid]] and [[scarlet fever]], which were previously rife in China, were nearly eradicated by the campaign. After Deng Xiaoping began instituting economic reforms in 1978, the health of the Chinese public improved rapidly because of better nutrition, although many of the free public health services provided in the countryside disappeared along with the People's Communes. Healthcare in China became mostly [[private healthcare|privatized]], and experienced a significant rise in quality.

The first leaders of the People's Republic of China were born into the traditional imperial order, but were influenced by the [[May Fourth Movement]] and reformist ideals. They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture, such as rural land tenure, [[sexism]], and the Confucian system of education, while preserving others, such as the family structure and culture of obedience to the state. Some observers see the period following the establishment of the PRC in 1949 as a continuation of traditional Chinese dynastic history, while others claim that the Communist Party's rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese culture, especially through political movements such as the [[Cultural Revolution]] of the 1960s, where many aspects of traditional culture were destroyed, having been denounced as "regressive and harmful" or "vestiges of [[feudalism]]".
