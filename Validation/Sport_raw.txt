[[File:Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Sport in [[childhood]]. [[Association football]], shown above, is a [[team sport]] which also provides opportunities to nurture [[physical fitness]] and [[social actions|social interaction]] skills.]]

'''Sport''' ([[British English]]) or '''sports''' ([[American English]]) includes all forms of [[Competition|competitive]] [[physical activity]] or [[game]]s which,&lt;ref name=sportaccord&gt;{{cite web |publisher=SportAccord |url=http://www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idIndex=32&amp;idContent=14881 |title=Definition of sport |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028112912/http://www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idIndex=32&amp;idContent=14881 |archivedate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, [[entertainment]] for spectators.&lt;ref name=council&gt;{{cite web |last=Council of Europe |title=The European sport charter |url=https://wcd.coe.int/wcd/ViewDoc.jsp?id=206451 |accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in [[team]]s or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as [[racing]], many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a ''match'') is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide [[tie-breaking methods]] to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a [[tournament]] producing a [[champion]]. Many [[sports league]]s make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular [[sports season]], followed in some cases by [[playoffs]].

Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical [[athleticism]] or physical [[dexterity]], with the largest major competitions such as the [[Olympic Games]] admitting only sports meeting this definition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/sports |title=List of Summer and Winter Olympic Sports and Events |publisher=The Olympic Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other organisations such as the [[Council of Europe]] using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports.&lt;ref name=council/&gt; However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as [[mind sport]]s. The International Olympic Committee (through [[Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations|ARISF]]) recognises both [[chess]] and [[Contract bridge|bridge]] as ''bona fide'' sports, and [[SportAccord]], the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess, [[draughts]] (checkers), [[Go (game)|Go]] and [[xiangqi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=SportAccord |title=World Mind Games |url=http://www.sportaccord.com/en/multi-sports-games/index.php?idIndex=35&amp;idContent=658 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508021848/http://www.sportaccord.com/en/multi-sports-games/index.php?idIndex=35&amp;idContent=658 |archivedate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=SportAccord |title=Members |url=http://www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idContent=644&amp;idIndex=32 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507073823/http://www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idContent=644&amp;idIndex=32 |archivedate=7 May 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.&lt;ref name=sportaccord/&gt;

Sport is usually governed by a set of [[regulation of sport|rules]] or [[tradition|customs]], which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring [[goal (sport)|goals]] or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.

Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in [[sports journalism|sport news]]. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with [[spectator sport]] drawing large crowds to [[sport venue]]s, and reaching wider audiences through [[broadcasting of sports events|broadcasting]]. [[Sport betting]] is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.

According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21585012-sportswomen-are-beginning-score-more-commercial-goalsbut-they-still-have-lot-ground |title=Women in sport: Game, sex and match |work=The Economist |date=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world's most accessible and practised sport is [[running]], while [[association football]] is its most popular spectator sport.&lt;ref name=wa/&gt;

==Meaning and usage==
===Etymology===
The word "sport" comes from the [[Old French]] ''desport'' meaning "[[leisure]]", with the oldest definition in English from around 1300 being "anything humans find amusing or entertaining".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=sport&amp;searchmode=none |title=sport (n.) |accessdate=20 April 2008 |first=Douglas |last=Harper |work=Online Etymological Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of gambling; hunting; and games and diversions, including ones that require exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged |publisher=G&amp;C Merriam Company |location=Springfield, MA |page=2206 |year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roget's defines the noun sport as an "activity engaged in for relaxation and amusement" with synonyms including diversion and recreation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Roget's II: The New Thesaurus, Third Edition |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url=http://thesaurus.reference.com/browse/sport |year=1995 |isbn=0-618-25414-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nomenclature===
The singular term "sport" is used in most English dialects to describe the overall concept (e.g. "children taking part in sport"), with "sports" used to describe multiple activities (e.g. "football and rugby are the most popular sports in England"). American English uses "sports" for both terms.

===Definition===
{{see also|Game#Definitions}}
[[File:ChessStartingPosition.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|The International Olympic Committee recognises some board games as sports including [[chess]].]]
[[File:Showjumping white horse.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Show jumping]], an [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sport]]
The precise definition of what separates a sport from other leisure activities varies between sources. The closest to an international agreement on a definition is provided by [[SportAccord]], which is the association for all the largest international sports federations (including [[association football]], [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[cycling]], [[tennis]], [[equestrianism|equestrian sports]], and more), and is therefore the ''de facto'' representative of international sport.

SportAccord uses the following criteria, determining that a sport should:&lt;ref name=sportaccord/&gt;
*have an element of competition
*be in no way harmful to any living creature
*not rely on equipment provided by a single supplier (excluding proprietary games such as [[arena football]])
*not rely on any "luck" element specifically designed into the sport.

They also recognise that sport can be primarily physical (such as [[rugby union|rugby]] or [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]]), primarily mind (such as [[chess]] or [[Go (game)|Go]]), predominantly motorised (such as [[Formula 1]] or [[powerboating]]), primarily co-ordination (such as [[cue sports|billiard sports]]), or primarily animal-supported (such as [[equestrian sport]]).&lt;ref name=sportaccord/&gt;

The inclusion of mind sports within sport definitions has not been universally accepted, leading to legal challenges from governing bodies in regards to being denied funding available to sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |title=Judicial review of 'sport' or 'game' decision begins |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34320201 |date=2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst SportAccord recognises a small number of mind sports, it is not open to admitting any further mind sports.

There has been an increase in the application of the term "sport" to a wider set of non-physical challenges such as [[video game]]s, also called [[esports]], especially due to the large scale of participation and organised competition, but these are not widely recognised by mainstream sports organisations. According to [[Council of Europe]], European Sports Charter, article 2.i, {{"'}}Sport' means all forms of physical activity which, through casual or organised participation, aim at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well-being, forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels."&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe, [https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=09000016804c9dbb Revised European Sports Charter] (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition===
There are opposing views on the necessity of [[competition]] as a defining element of a sport, with almost all [[professional sport]] involving competition, and governing bodies requiring competition as a prerequisite of recognition by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) or SportAccord.&lt;ref name=sportaccord/&gt;

Other bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical activity. For instance, the [[Council of Europe]] include all forms of physical exercise, including those competed just for fun.

In order to widen participation, and reduce the impact of losing on less able participants, there has been an introduction of non-competitive physical activity to traditionally competitive events such as school [[sports day]]s, although moves like this are often controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Front |first=Rebecca |work=The Guardian |title=A little competition |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/17/school-sport-competitive-children-achievement-ambition |date=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=ParentDish |title=Why parents hate school sports day |last=Scrimgeour |first=Heidi |date=17 June 2011 |url=http://www.parentdish.co.uk/2011/06/17/why-parents-hate-school-sports-day/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In competitive events, participants are graded or classified based on their "result" and often divided into groups of comparable performance, (e.g. gender, weight and age). The measurement of the result may be objective or subjective, and corrected with "handicaps" or penalties. In a race, for example, the time to complete the course is an objective measurement. In [[gymnastics]] or [[diving (sport)|diving]] the result is decided by a panel of judges, and therefore subjective. There are many shades of judging between boxing and mixed martial arts, where victory is assigned by judges if neither competitor has lost at the end of the match time.

==History==
{{Main article|History of sport}}
[[File:Greek statue discus thrower 2 century aC.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] bronze reduction of [[Myron]]'s [[Discobolos]], 2nd century AD.]]

Artifacts and structures suggest [[sport in China]] as early as 2000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chineseculture.about.com/library/weekly/aa032301a.htm |title=Sports History in China}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gymnastics appears to have been popular in China's ancient past. Monuments to the [[Pharaoh]]s indicate that a number of sports, including swimming and fishing, were well-developed and regulated several thousands of years ago in [[ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ioa.leeds.ac.uk/1980s/84085.htm |title=Mr Ahmed D. Touny (EGY), IOC Member |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029232515/http://www.ioa.leeds.ac.uk/1980s/84085.htm |archivedate=29 October 2006 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Egyptian sports included javelin throwing, high jump, and wrestling. [[Ancient Persia]]n sports such as the traditional [[Iran]]ian martial art of [[Zourkhaneh]] had a close connection to warfare skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kuwait-info.com/newsnew/NewsDetails1.asp?id=78319&amp;dt=10/13/2006&amp;ntype=World |title=Persian warriors |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326081959/http://www.kuwait-info.com/newsnew/NewsDetails1.asp?id=78319&amp;dt=10%2F13%2F2006&amp;ntype=World |archivedate=26 March 2007 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other sports that originated in ancient Persia are [[polo]] and [[jousting]].

[[File:Bruno Senna 2006 Australian Grand Prix.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Motorsport|Motorised sports]] have appeared since the advent of the modern age.]]
[[File:GoÅ›cie Intel Extreme Masters (8465481816).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Electronic sports]] are a recent development.]]
A wide range of sports were already established by the time of [[Ancient Greece]] and the military culture and the development of sport in Greece influenced one another considerably. Sport became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic Games, which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]] called [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/ancient/index_uk.asp |title=Ancient Olympic Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports have been increasingly organised and regulated from the time of the ancient Olympics up to the present century. Industrialisation has brought increased [[leisure time]], letting people attend and follow spectator sports and participate in athletic activities. These trends continued with the advent of [[mass media]] and global communication. Professionalism became prevalent, further adding to the increase in sport's popularity, as sports fans followed the exploits of professional athletes&amp;nbsp;â€“ all while enjoying the exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sports. Since the turn of the 21st&amp;nbsp;century, there has been increasing debate about whether [[transgender]] sportspersons should be able to participate in sport events that conform with their post-transition [[gender identity]].&lt;ref&gt;Sport and the Law: Historical and Cultural Intersections, p 111, Sarah K. Fields - 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fair play==
===Sportsmanship===
{{Main article|Sportsmanship}}
{{See also|Gamesmanship|Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing}}

Sportsmanship is an attitude that strives for fair play, courtesy toward teammates and opponents, ethical behaviour and integrity, and grace in victory or defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=sportsmanship |publisher=Merriam-Webster |title=Sportsmanship}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fish |first1=Joel |last2=Magee |first2=Susan |year=2003 |title=101 Ways to Be a Terrific Sports Parent |publisher=Fireside |page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lacey |first=David |date=10 November 2007 |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/11/10/it_takes_a_bad_loser_to_become.html |title=It takes a bad loser to become a good winner |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sportsmanship expresses an aspiration or ethos that the activity will be enjoyed for its own sake. The well-known sentiment by sports journalist [[Grantland Rice]], that it's "not that you won or lost but how you played the game", and the modern Olympic creed expressed by its founder [[Pierre de Coubertin]]: "The most important thing... is not winning but taking part" are typical expressions of this sentiment.

===Cheating===
{{see also|Match fixing|cheating}}
Key principles of sport include that the result should not be predetermined, and that both sides should have equal opportunity to win. Rules are in place to ensure fair play, but participants can break these rules in order to gain advantage.

Participants may cheat in order to unfairly increase their chance of winning, or in order to achieve other advantages such as financial gains. The widespread existence of [[gambling]] on the results of sports fixtures creates a motivation for [[match fixing]], where a participant or participants deliberately work to ensure a given outcome rather than simply playing to win.

===Doping and drugs===
{{main article|Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport}}
The competitive nature of sport encourages some participants to attempt to enhance their performance through the use of medicines, or through other means such as [[Blood doping|increasing the volume of blood in their bodies through artificial means]].

All sports recognised by the IOC or SportAccord are required to implement a testing programme, looking for a list of banned drugs, with suspensions or bans being placed on participants who test positive for banned substances.

===Violence===
[[Violence in sports]] involves crossing the line between fair competition and intentional aggressive violence. Athletes, coaches, fans, and parents sometimes unleash violent behaviour on people or property, in misguided shows of loyalty, dominance, anger, or celebration. [[Rioting]] or [[hooliganism]] by fans in particular is a problem at some national and international sporting contests.

==Participation==
===Gender participation===

{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}
{{see also|Women's sports|Women's professional sports|Women's sports in the United States}}
Female participation in sports continues to rise alongside the opportunity for involvement and the value of sports for [[child development]] and [[physical fitness]]. Despite gains during the last three decades, a gap persists in the enrollment figures between male and female players. Female players account for 39% of the total participation in US interscholastic athletics. Gender balance has been accelerating from a 32% increase in 1973â€“74 to a 63% increase in 1994â€“95. Hessel (2000).{{Full citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Youth participation===
{{expand section|date=March 2012}}
{{See also|College sport}}
Youth sport presents children with opportunities for fun, socialisation, forming peer relationships, physical fitness, and [[athletic scholarship]]s. Activists for [[education]] and the [[war on drugs]] encourage youth sport as a means to increase [[Participation inequality|educational participation]] and to fight the [[illegal drug trade]]. According to the [[Nationwide Children's Hospital (Columbus)#Research and education|Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital]], the biggest risk for youth sport is death or serious injury including [[concussion]]. These risks come from running, basketball, association football, volleyball, gridiron, gymnastics, and ice hockey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthland.time.com/2009/08/04/why-are-more-kids-getting-hurt-in-gym-class/ "Gym class injuries up 150% between 1997 and 2007"], ''Time'', 4 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Youth sport in the US is a $15 billion industry including equipment up to private coaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gregory |first1=Sean |title=How Kids' Sports Became a $15 Billion Industry |url=http://time.com/4913687/how-kids-sports-became-15-billion-industry/ |accessdate=24 August 2017 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disabled participation===
[[File:David Bizet - Marathon de Paris 2014.jpg|thumb|right|A runner gives a friendly tap on the shoulder to a wheelchair racer during the [[Paris Marathon|''Marathon International de Paris'' (Paris Marathon)]] in 2014.]]
{{see also|Disabled sports}}
'''Disabled sports''' also '''adaptive sports''' or '''parasports''', are sports played by persons with a [[disability]], including [[physical disability|physical]] and [[intellectual disabilities]]. As many of these are based on existing sports modified to meet the needs of persons with a disability, they are sometimes referred to as ''adapted sports''. However, not all disabled sports are adapted; several sports that have been specifically created for persons with a disability have no equivalent in able-bodied sports.

===Spectator involvement===
[[File:1906 Athens stadium.jpg|thumb|right|Spectators at the 1906 unofficial Olympic Games]]
{{Main article|Spectator sport}}
The competition element of sport, along with the aesthetic appeal of some sports, result in the popularity of people attending to watch sport being played. This has led to the specific phenomenon of [[spectator sport]].

Both amateur and professional sports attract spectators, both in person at the sport venue, and through broadcast media including [[radio broadcasting|radio]], [[television]] and [[internet]] broadcast. Both attendance in person and viewing remotely can incur a sometimes substantial charge, such as an entrance ticket, or [[pay-per-view]] television broadcast.

It is common for popular sports to attract large broadcast audiences, leading to rival broadcasters bidding large amounts of money for the rights to show certain fixtures. The football [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] attracts a global [[television]] audience of hundreds of millions; the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] [[FIFA World Cup Finals|final]] alone attracted an estimated worldwide audience of well over 700&amp;nbsp;million and the [[2011 Cricket World Cup Final]]  attracted an estimated audience of 135&amp;nbsp;million in India alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=135 mn saw World Cup final: TAM |date=10 April 2011 |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/CorporateNews/135-mn-saw-World-Cup-final-TAM/Article1-683623.aspx |newspaper=Hindustan Times |accessdate=1 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803013151/http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/CorporateNews/135-mn-saw-World-Cup-final-TAM/Article1-683623.aspx |archivedate=3 August 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the championship game of the [[National Football League|NFL]], the [[Super Bowl]], has become one of the most watched television broadcasts of the year.&lt;ref name="SB15"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/super-bowl-sets-viewership-record-161138960.html |title=Super Bowl XLIX was the most-viewed television program in U.S. history |publisher=Yahoo Sports |date=2 February 2015 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cbc8df2a-aafd-11e4-81bc-00144feab7de.html |title=Super Bowl most watched television show in US history |work=Financial Times |date=2 February 2015 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amateur and professional===
[[File:OHL-Hockey-Plymouth-Whalers-vs-Saginaw-Spirit.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Modern sports have complex [[Regulation of sport|rules]] and are highly organised.]]

Sport can be undertaken on an amateur, professional or semi-professional basis, depending on whether participants are incentivised for participation (usually through payment of a [[wage]] or [[salary]]). Amateur participation in sport at lower levels is often called "grassroots sport".&lt;ref name="council"/&gt;&lt;ref name="White Paper"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=European Commission |title=The White Paper on Sport |url=http://ec.europa.eu/sport/white-paper/index_en.htm |accessdate=11 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916202200/http://ec.europa.eu/sport/white-paper/index_en.htm |archivedate=16 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of [[spectator sport]] as a recreation for non-participants has led to sport becoming a major business in its own right, and this has incentivised a high paying [[professional sport]] culture, where high performing participants are rewarded with pay far in excess of average wages, which can run into millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Sports Illustrated |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/specials/fortunate50-2011/index.html |title=Fortunate 50 2011 |last=Freedman |first=Jonah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sports, or individual competitions within a sport, retain a policy of allowing only [[amateur sport]]. The [[Olympic Games]] started with a principle of amateur competition with those who practised a sport professionally considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby.&lt;ref name=OIdeology&gt;{{cite book |last=Eassom |first=Simon |title=Critical Reflections on Olympic Ideology |year=1994 |location=Ontario |publisher=The Centre for Olympic Studies |pages=120â€“123 |isbn=0-7714-1697-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1971, Olympic athletes were allowed to receive compensation and sponsorship,&lt;ref name="InfoPlease"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/olympic-athletes.html |title=Olympic Athletes |publisher=Info Please |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1986, the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the Olympics,&lt;ref name="InfoPlease"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/22/opinion/greene-olympics-amateurs/ |title=What changed the Olympics forever |publisher=CNN |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the exceptions of [[boxing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/13894/olympic-boxing-must-remain-amateur-despite-moves-to-turn-it-professional-states-warren- |title=Olympic boxing must remain amateur despite moves to turn it professional states Warren |publisher=Inside the Games |date=13 August 2011 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njefAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA400&amp;lpg=PA400&amp;dq=only+amateur+boxers+at+olympics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0jbCDYw8R1&amp;sig=6_-OvLg15u_iGOSTCS6lxm8dedw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwATgKahUKEwi6xNfgiI3GAhVRBNsKHf_HAJ0#v=onepage&amp;q=only%20amateur%20boxers%20at%20olympics&amp;f=false |title=Historical Dictionary of Boxing |last1=Grasso |first1=John |date=2013 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1529280-olympic-wrestling-is-important-for-pro-wrestlers-and-its-fans |title=Olympic Wrestling Is Important for Pro Wrestling and Its Fans |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=14 February 2013 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2WYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=only+amateur+wrestlers+at+olympics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a7VnB9vii1&amp;sig=E0kjCilT-UbvD94prBgV1LIgmSE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwB2oVChMI9NP2pomNxgIVoQrbCh2kbQC_#v=onepage&amp;q=only%20amateur%20wrestlers%20at%20olympics&amp;f=false |title=Boys' Life |date=August 1988 |page=24 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
Technology plays an important part in modern sport. With it being a necessary part of some sports (such as motorsport), it is used in others to improve performance. Some sports also use it to allow off-field decision making.
 
[[Sports science]] is a widespread academic discipline, and can be applied to areas including athlete performance, such as the use of video analysis to fine-tune technique, or to equipment, such as improved [[running shoe]]s or [[competitive swimwear]]. [[Sports engineering]] emerged as a discipline in 1998 with an increasing focus not just on materials design but also the use of technology in sport, from analytics and big data to [[wearable technology]].&lt;ref name="Gaining Steam in Sports Technology"&gt;{{cite web |title=Gaining Steam in Sports Technology |url=https://alum.mit.edu/pages/sliceofmit/2014/06/17/mit-steam-sports-technology/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714150052/https://alum.mit.edu/pages/sliceofmit/2014/06/17/mit-steam-sports-technology/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 July 2014 |website=Slice of MIT |accessdate=3 January 2015 |ref=Slice of MIT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to control the impact of technology on fair play, governing bodies frequently have specific rules that are set to control the impact of technical advantage between participants. For example, in 2010, full-body, non-textile swimsuits were banned by [[FINA]], as they were enhancing swimmers' performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/swimming/8161867.stm |title=Hi-tech suits banned from January |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/full-body-swimsuit-now-banned-professional-swimmers/story?id=9437780 |title=Full Body Swimsuit Now Banned for Professional Swimmers |publisher=ABC News |date=4 January 2010 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in technology has also allowed many decisions in sports matches to be taken, or reviewed, off-field, with another official using instant replays to make decisions. In some sports, players can now challenge decisions made by officials. In [[Association football]], [[goal-line technology]] makes decisions on whether a ball has crossed the goal line or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=FIFA |title=Testing Manual |journal=FIFA Quality Programme for Goal Line Technology |year=2012 |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifaqualityprogramme/goal-linetechnology/01/66/02/89/glt_testing_manual_2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology is not compulsory,&lt;ref name=IFABofficial&gt;{{cite web |title=IFAB makes three unanimous historic decisions |url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2012/m=7/news=ifab-makes-three-unanimous-historic-decisions-1660541.html |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was used in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] in Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2014/m=4/news=goal-line-technology-set-ahead-fifa-world-cup-2311481.html |title=Goal-line technology set up ahead of FIFA World Cup |date=1 April 2014 |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup]] in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/news/y=2015/m=3/news=hawk-eye-confirmed-as-goal-line-technology-provider-for-canada-2015-2580727.html |title=Hawk-Eye confirmed as goal-line technology provider for Canada 2015 |date=31 March 2015 |publisher=[[FIFA]] |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the [[Premier League]] from [[2013â€“14 Premier League|2013â€“14]],&lt;ref name="BBC_Premier"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22107409 |title=Goal-line technology: Premier League votes in favour for 2013-14 |publisher=BBC |date=11 April 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bundesliga]] from [[2015â€“16 Bundesliga|2015â€“16]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carlyleobserver.com/sports/bundesliga-approves-hawk-eye-goal-line-technology-for-new-season-1.1650074 |title=Bundesliga approves Hawk-Eye goal-line technology for new season |work=Carlyle Observer |accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[NFL]], a referee can ask for a review from the replay booth, or a head coach can issue a [[Challenge (NFL)|challenge]] to review the play using replays.

===Politics===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2010}}
{{Main article|Politics and sports}}
Sports and politics can influence each other greatly.

[[Benito Mussolini]] used the [[1934 FIFA World Cup]], which was held in [[Italy]], to showcase [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922â€“1943)|Fascist Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWj7BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28 |title=Soccer Vs. the State: Tackling Football and Radical Politics |last1=Kuhn |first1=Gabriel |date=2011 |page=28 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="World Fascism"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nvD2rZSVau4C&amp;pg=PA630 |title=World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1 |last1=Blamires |first1=Cyprian |date=2006 |pages=630â€“632 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolf Hitler]] also used the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Berlin]], and the [[1936 Winter Olympics]] held in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], to promote the [[Nazi ideology]] of the superiority of the [[Aryan race]], and inferiority of the Jews and other "[[Untermensch|undesirables]]".&lt;ref name="World Fascism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sociology Sport"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uKarC6oX3P8C&amp;pg=PT32&amp;dq=hitler+used+1936+olympics+to+promote+ideology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=x6N1Va3pJ-Sa7gaVoICoBA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=hitler%20used%201936%20olympics%20to%20promote%20ideology&amp;f=false |title=The Sociology of Sport and Physical Education |last1=Saxena |first1=Anurag |year=2001 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany used the Olympics to give of itself a peaceful image while it was very actively preparing the war.&lt;ref&gt;Kulttuurivihkot 1 2009 Berliinin olympialaiset 1936 Poliittisen viattomuuden menetys Jouko Jokisalo 28-29{{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[apartheid]] was the official policy in [[South Africa]], many sports people, particularly in [[rugby union]], adopted the conscientious approach that they should not appear in competitive sports there. Some feel this was an effective contribution to the eventual demolition of the policy of apartheid, others feel that it may have prolonged and reinforced its worst effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1478-0542.2005.00165.x |title=Sport and apartheid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the history of [[Ireland]], Gaelic sports were connected with [[cultural nationalism]]. Until the mid-20th&amp;nbsp;century a person could have been banned from playing [[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]], or other sports administered by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) if she/he played or supported [[Association football]], or other games seen to be of [[Great Britain|British]] origin. Until recently the GAA continued to ban the playing of football and [[rugby union]] at Gaelic venues. This ban, also known as Rule 42,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fulton |first=Gareth |last2=Bairner |first2=Alan |year=2007 |title=Sport, Space and National Identity in Ireland: The GAA, Croke Park and Rule&amp;nbsp;42. |url= |journal=Space &amp; policy |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=55â€“74 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is still enforced, but was modified to allow football and rugby to be played in [[Croke Park]] while [[Lansdowne Road]] was redeveloped into [[Aviva Stadium]]. Until recently, under Rule&amp;nbsp;21, the GAA also banned members of the British security forces and members of the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] from playing Gaelic games, but the advent of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998 led to the eventual removal of the ban.

[[Nationalism]] is often evident in the pursuit of sport, or in its reporting: people compete in national teams, or commentators and audiences can adopt a partisan view. On occasion, such tensions can lead to violent confrontation among players or spectators within and beyond the sporting venue, as in the [[Football War]]. These trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sport being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants.

A very famous case when sport and politics collided was the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Masked men entered the hotel of the Israeli olympic team and killed many of their men. This was known as the [[Munich massacre]].

A study of US elections has shown that the result of sports events can affect the results. A study published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] showed that when the home team wins the game before the election, the incumbent candidates can increase their share of the vote by 1.5&amp;nbsp;percent. A loss had the opposite effect, and the effect is greater for higher-profile teams or unexpected wins and losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Will Ohio State's Football Team Decide Who Wins the White House? |author1=Tyler Cowen |author2=Kevin Grier |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=24 October 2012 |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/how_the_presidential_race_between_barack_obama_and_mitt_romney_could_be.html |accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, when [[Washington Redskins]] win their final game before an election, then the incumbent President is more likely to win, and if the Redskins lose, then the opposition candidate is more likely to win; this has become known as the [[Redskins Rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/football-insider/wp/2012/11/03/will-redskins-rule-again-determine-outcome-of-presidential-election/ |title=Will Redskins Rule again determine outcome of presidential election? |author=Mike Jones |date=3 November 2012 |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfrontrow.com/2012/10/redskins-rule-mnfs-hirdt-on-intersection-of-football-politics/ |title='Redskins Rule': MNF's Hirdt on intersection of football &amp; politics |work=ESPN Front Row}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sports as a means of controlling and subduing populations====
[[Ã‰tienne de La BoÃ©tie]], in his essay ''[[Discourse on Voluntary Servitude]]'' describes athletic spectacles as means for tyrants to control their subjects by distracting them.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Do not imagine that there is any bird more easily caught by decoy, nor any fish sooner fixed on the hook by wormy bait, than are all these poor fools neatly tricked into servitude by the slightest feather passed, so to speak, before their mouths. Truly it is a marvelous thing that they let themselves be caught so quickly at the slightest tickling of their fancy. Plays, farces, spectacles, gladiators, strange beasts, medals, pictures, and other such opiates, these were for ancient peoples the bait toward slavery, the price of their liberty, the instruments of tyranny. By these practices and enticements the ancient dictators so successfully lulled their subjects under the yoke, that the stupefied peoples, fascinated by the pastimes and vain pleasures flashed before their eyes, learned subservience as naÃ¯vely, but not so creditably, as little children learn to read by looking at bright picture books.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ã‰tienne de La BoÃ©tie]], ''[[Discourse on Voluntary Servitude]]'' (1549), Part 2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Religious views on sports===
The practice of athletic competitions has been criticised by some Christian thinkers as a form of [[idolatry]], in which "human beings extol themselves, adore themselves, sacrifice themselves and reward themselves."&lt;ref name=Watson1&gt;''Sports and Christianity: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives'', Nick J. Watson, ed. (Routledge: 2013), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Sports are seen by these critics as a manifestation of "collective pride" and "national self-deification" in which feats of human power are idolized at the expense of divine worship.&lt;ref name=Watson1/&gt;

[[Tertullian]] condemns the athletic performances of his day, insisting "the entire apparatus of the shows is based upon idolatry."&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''[[De spectaculis]]'', Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The shows, says Tertullian, excite passions foreign to the calm temperament cultivated by the Christian:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
God has enjoined us to deal calmly, gently, quietly, and peacefully with the Holy Spirit, because these things are alone in keeping with the goodness of His nature, with His tenderness and sensitiveness. ... Well, how shall this be made to accord with the shows? For the show always leads to spiritual agitation, since where there is pleasure, there is keenness of feeling giving pleasure its zest; and where there is keenness of feeling, there is rivalry giving in turn its zest to that. Then, too, where you have rivalry, you have rage, bitterness, wrath and grief, with all bad things which flow from them&amp;nbsp;â€“ the whole entirely out of keeping with the religion of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;''[[De spectaculis]]'' Chapter 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
