{{About|a slowdown in economic activity}}
{{Economics sidebar}}
In economics, a '''recession''' is a [[business cycle]] contraction when there is a general slowdown in economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/recession|title=Recession |accessdate=19 November 2008 |publisher=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861699686 |title=Recession definition |accessdate=19 November 2008 |work=Encarta World English Dictionary [North American Edition] |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328205929/https://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861699686 |archivedate=28 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[macroeconomics|Macroeconomic]] indicators such as [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] (gross domestic product), investment spending, [[capacity utilization]], household income, business profits, and inflation fall, while bankruptcies and the [[unemployment rate]] rise. In the United Kingdom, it is defined as a negative economic growth for two consecutive quarters.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7495340.stm | work=BBC News | title=Q&amp;A: What is a recession? | date=8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UKTreasury&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of Treasury terms|url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/junebudget_glossary.htm|publisher=[[HM Treasury]]|accessdate=25 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102095705/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/junebudget_glossary.htm|archivedate=2 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recessions generally occur when there is a widespread drop in spending (an adverse demand shock). This may be triggered by various events, such as a [[financial crisis]], an external trade shock, an adverse [[supply shock]] or the bursting of an [[economic bubble]]. Governments usually respond to recessions by adopting expansionary [[macroeconomic policies]], such as [[monetary policy|increasing money supply]], [[fiscal policy|increasing government spending and decreasing taxation]].

==Definition==
In a 1974 ''[[The New York Times]]'' article, Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Julius Shiskin suggested several rules of thumb for defining a recession, one of which was two down consecutive quarters of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = The Changing Business Cycle|newspaper=The New York Times|page = 222|date = 1 December 1974|first = Julius|last = Shiskin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In time, the other rules of thumb were forgotten. Some economists prefer a definition of a 1.5-2 percentage points rise in unemployment within 12 months.&lt;ref name="Eslake"/&gt;

In the [[United States]], the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (NBER) is generally seen as the authority for dating US recessions. The NBER defines an economic recession as: "a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in [[real GDP]], [[real income]], employment, [[industrial production]], and [[wholesale]]-[[retail sales]]."&lt;ref name="nber.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nber.org/cycles/|title= Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions|accessdate=19 November 2008 |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012231548/https://www.nber.org/cycles/ |archivedate = 12 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost universally, academics, economists, policy makers, and businesses defer to the determination by the NBER for the precise dating of a recession's onset and end.

In the [[United Kingdom]], [[List of recessions in the United Kingdom|recessions]] are generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, as measured by the seasonal adjusted quarter-on-quarter figures for [[real GDP]]&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKTreasury/&gt;, with the same definition being used for all other member states of the [[European Union]].
&lt;ref&gt;google&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attributes==
A recession has many attributes that can occur simultaneously and includes declines in component measures of economic activity (GDP) such as consumption, [[investment]], government spending, and net export activity. These summary measures reflect underlying drivers such as employment levels and skills, household savings rates, corporate investment decisions, interest rates, demographics, and government policies.

Economist [[Richard Koo|Richard C. Koo]] wrote that under ideal conditions, a country's economy should have the household sector as net savers and the corporate sector as net borrowers, with the government budget nearly balanced and net exports near zero.&lt;ref name="Koo 2009"&gt;{{cite book

Policy responses are often designed to drive the economy back towards this ideal state of balance.

A severe (GDP down by 10%) or prolonged (three or four years) recession is referred to as an [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]], although some argue that their causes and cures can be different.&lt;ref name="Eslake"&gt;[http://clubtroppo.com.au/2008/11/23/what-is-the-difference-between-a-recession-and-a-depression/ "What is the difference between a recession and a depression?"] Saul Eslake Nov 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  As an informal shorthand, economists sometimes refer to different [[recession shapes]], such as [[V-shaped recession|V-shaped]], [[U-shaped recession|U-shaped]], [[L-shaped recession|L-shaped]] and [[W-shaped recession|W-shaped]] recessions.

===Type of recession or shape===
{{Main|Recession shapes}}
The type and shape of recessions are distinctive. In the US, v-shaped, or short-and-sharp contractions followed by rapid and sustained recovery, occurred in 1954 and 1990–91; U-shaped (prolonged slump) in 1974–75, and W-shaped, or [[double-dip recession]]s in 1949 and 1980–82. Japan’s 1993–94 recession was U-shaped and its 8-out-of-9 quarters of contraction in 1997–99 can be described as L-shaped. [[Korea]], [[Hong Kong]] and South-east Asia experienced U-shaped recessions in 1997–98, although [[Thailand]]’s eight consecutive quarters of decline should be termed L-shaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Key_Indicators/2001/default.asp |title=Key Indicators 2001: Growth and Change in Asia and the Pacific |publisher=ADB.org |accessdate=31 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317155544/http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Key_Indicators/2001/default.asp |archivedate=17 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological aspects===
Recessions have psychological and confidence aspects. For example, if companies expect economic activity to slow, they may reduce employment levels and save [[money]] rather than invest. Such expectations can create a self-reinforcing downward cycle, bringing about or worsening a recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Samuelson, Robert J. |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/13/AR2010061303330.html |title=Our economy's crisis of confidence |work=The Washington Post |date= 14 June 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer confidence is one measure used to evaluate economic sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.conference-board.org/economics/consumerconfidence.cfm |title=The Conference Board – Consumer Confidence Survey Press Release – May 2010 |publisher=Conference-board.org |date=25 March 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[Animal spirits (Keynes)|animal spirits]] has been used to describe the [[psychological]] factors underlying economic activity. Economist [[Robert J. Shiller]] wrote that the term "...refers also to the sense of trust we have in each other, our sense of fairness in economic dealings, and our sense of the extent of corruption and bad faith. When animal spirits are on ebb, consumers do not want to spend and businesses do not want to make capital expenditures or hire people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shiller |first=Robert J. |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123302080925418107 |title=WSJ – Robert Shiller – Animal Spirits Depend on Trust |work=The Wall Street Journal  |date=27 January 2009 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balance sheet recession===
{{Main|Balance sheet recession}}
High levels of indebtedness or the bursting of a real estate or financial asset price bubble can cause what is called a "balance sheet recession." This is when large numbers of consumers or corporations pay down debt (i.e., save) rather than spend or invest, which slows the economy. The term [[balance sheet]] derives from an accounting identity that holds that assets must always equal the sum of liabilities plus equity. If asset prices fall below the value of the debt incurred to purchase them, then the equity must be negative, meaning the consumer or corporation is insolvent. Economist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in 2014 that "the best working hypothesis seems to be that the [[subprime mortgage crisis|financial crisis]] was only one manifestation of a broader problem of excessive debt--that it was a so-called "balance sheet recession." In Krugman's view, such crises require debt reduction strategies combined with higher government spending to offset declines from the private sector as it pays down its debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/jul/10/geithner-does-he-pass-test/|title=Does He Pass the Test?|first=Paul|last=Krugman|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, economist Richard Koo wrote that Japan's "Great Recession" that began in 1990 was a "balance sheet recession." It was triggered by a collapse in land and stock prices, which caused Japanese firms to have [[negative equity]], meaning their assets were worth less than their liabilities. Despite zero [[interest rate]]s and expansion of the [[money supply]] to encourage borrowing, Japanese corporations in aggregate opted to pay down their debts from their own business earnings rather than borrow to invest as firms typically do. Corporate investment, a key demand component of GDP, fell enormously (22% of GDP) between 1990 and its peak decline in 2003. Japanese firms overall became net savers after 1998, as opposed to borrowers. Koo argues that it was massive fiscal stimulus (borrowing and spending by the government) that offset this decline and enabled Japan to maintain its level of GDP. In his view, this avoided a U.S. type [[Great Depression]], in which U.S. GDP fell by 46%. He argued that monetary policy was ineffective because there was limited demand for funds while firms paid down their liabilities.  In a balance sheet recession, GDP declines by the amount of debt repayment and un-borrowed individual savings, leaving government stimulus spending as the primary remedy.&lt;ref name="Koo 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koo 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gregory White|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/richard-koo-recession-2010-4#-1 |title=Presentation by Richard Koo – The Age of Balance Sheet Recessions |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=14 April 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue58/Koo58.pdf|title=Richard Koo – The World In Balance Sheet Recession – Real World Economics Review – December 2011|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krugman discussed the balance sheet recession concept during 2010, agreeing with Koo's situation assessment and view that sustained [[deficit spending]] when faced with a balance sheet recession would be appropriate. However, Krugman argued that monetary policy could also affect savings behavior, as inflation or credible promises of future inflation (generating negative real interest rates) would encourage less savings. In other words, people would tend to spend more rather than save if they believe inflation is on the horizon. In more technical terms, Krugman argues that the private sector savings curve is elastic even during a balance sheet recession (responsive to changes in real interest rates) disagreeing with Koo's view that it is inelastic (non-responsive to changes in real interest rates).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/notes-on-koo-wonkish/|title=Notes On Koo (Wonkish)|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/debt-deleveraging-and-liquidity-trap-new-model|title=Debt, deleveraging, and the liquidity trap|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=18 November 2010|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A July 2012 survey of balance sheet recession research reported that consumer demand and employment are affected by [[Household debt|household leverage]] levels. Both durable and non-durable goods consumption declined as households moved from low to high leverage with the decline in property values experienced during the [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. Further, reduced consumption due to higher household leverage can account for a significant decline in employment levels. Policies that help reduce mortgage debt or household leverage could therefore have stimulative effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/06/grim-natural-experiments/|title=Grim Natural Experiments|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nextnewdeal.net/rortybomb/new-report-literature-summary-new-balance-sheet-recession-research How Mortgage Debt is Holding Back the Economy – Mike Konczal – Roosevelt Institute – July 3, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016030017/http://www.nextnewdeal.net/rortybomb/new-report-literature-summary-new-balance-sheet-recession-research |date=October 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liquidity trap===
A [[liquidity trap]] is a [[Keynesian]] theory that a situation can develop in which interest rates reach near zero ([[zero interest-rate policy]]) yet do not effectively stimulate the economy. In theory, near-zero interest rates should encourage firms and consumers to borrow and spend. However, if too many individuals or corporations focus on saving or paying down debt rather than spending, lower interest rates have less effect on investment and consumption behavior; the lower interest rates are like "[[pushing on a string]]." Economist [[Paul Krugman]] described the [[Subprime mortgage crisis|U.S. 2009 recession]] and [[Lost decade (Japan)|Japan's lost decade]] as liquidity traps. One remedy to a liquidity trap is expanding the money supply via [[quantitative easing]] or other techniques in which money is effectively printed to purchase assets, thereby creating [[inflationary]] expectations that cause savers to begin spending again. Government stimulus spending and [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] policies to stimulate exports and reduce imports are other techniques to stimulate demand.&lt;ref name="Krugman 2009"&gt;{{cite book

===Paradoxes of thrift and deleveraging===
Behavior that may be optimal for an individual (e.g., saving more during adverse economic conditions) can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior, as ultimately one person's consumption is another person's income. Too many consumers attempting to save (or pay down debt) simultaneously is called the [[paradox of thrift]] and can cause or deepen a recession. Economist [[Hyman Minsky]] also described a "paradox of deleveraging" as financial institutions that have too much leverage (debt relative to equity) cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets.&lt;ref name="Yellen on Minsky"&gt;[http://www.frbsf.org/news/speeches/2009/0416.html Federal Reserve – Janet Yellen – A Minsky Meltdown – April 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

During April 2009, U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair [[Janet Yellen]] discussed these paradoxes: "Once this [[subprime mortgage crisis|massive credit crunch]] hit, it didn’t take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse [[feedback]] loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms—and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state—nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole."&lt;ref name="Yellen on Minsky" /&gt;

==Predictors==
There are no known completely reliable predictors, but the following are considered possible predictors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/003465398557320?cookieSet=1 |title=Predicting U.S. Recessions: Financial Variables as Leading Indicators |author=A Estrella, FS Mishkin |year=1995 |publisher=MIT Press}}

Analysis by [[Prakash Loungani]] of the [[International Monetary Fund]] found that only two of the sixty recessions around the world during the 1990s had been predicted by a consensus of economists one year earlier, while there were zero consensus predictions one year earlier for the 49 recessions during 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-25/grim-stock-signals-piling-up-as-wall-street-mulls-recession-odds|title=Grim Stock Signals Piling Up as Wall Street Mulls Recession Odds|website=www.bloomberg.com|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government responses==
{{See also|Stabilization policy}}

Most [[mainstream economics|mainstream economists]] believe that recessions are caused by inadequate [[aggregate demand]] in the economy, and favor the use of expansionary macroeconomic policy during recessions. Strategies favored for moving an economy out of a recession vary depending on which economic school the policymakers follow. [[Monetarism|Monetarists]] would favor the use of expansionary [[monetary policy]], while [[Keynesian]] economists may advocate increased [[government spending]] to spark economic growth. [[Supply-side]] economists may suggest tax cuts to promote business [[capital (economics)|capital]] investment.  When interest rates reach the boundary of an interest rate of zero percent ([[zero interest-rate policy]]) conventional monetary policy can no longer be used and government must use other measures to stimulate recovery.  Keynesians argue that [[fiscal policy]]—tax cuts or increased government spending—works when monetary policy fails.  Spending is more effective because of its larger [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]] but tax cuts take effect faster.

For example, [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in December 2010 that significant, sustained government spending was necessary because [[household debt|indebted households]] were paying down debts and unable to carry the U.S. economy as they had previously: "The root of our current troubles lies in the debt American families ran up during the Bush-era housing bubble...highly indebted Americans not only can’t spend the way they used to, they’re having to pay down the debts they ran up in the bubble years. This would be fine if someone else were taking up the slack. But what’s actually happening is that some people are spending much less while nobody is spending more — and this translates into a depressed economy and high unemployment. What the government should be doing in this situation is spending more while the private sector is spending less, supporting employment while those debts are paid down. And this government spending needs to be sustained..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/opinion/13krugman.html|title=Opinion - Block Those Economic Metaphors|first=Paul|last=Krugman|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stock market==
Some recessions have been anticipated by stock market declines. In ''[[Stocks for the Long Run]]'', Siegel mentions that since 1948, ten recessions were preceded by a stock market decline, by a lead time of 0 to 13 months (average 5.7 months), while ten stock market declines of greater than 10% in the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] were not followed by a recession.&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Jeremy J. (2002). ''Stocks for the Long Run: The Definitive Guide to Financial Market Returns and Long-Term Investment Strategies'', 3rd, New York: McGraw-Hill, 388. {{ISBN|978-0-07-137048-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the business cycle is very hard to predict, Siegel argues that it is not possible to take advantage of economic cycles for timing investments. Even the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (NBER) takes a few months to determine if a peak or trough has occurred in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/10/AR2007121001589.html Recession Predictions and Investment Decisions] by Allan Sloan, 11 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

During an economic decline, [[high yield stocks]] such as [[fast-moving consumer goods]], [[pharmaceutical]]s, and [[tobacco]] tend to hold up better.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2008/02/05/news/economy/recession_invest.fortune/index.htm?postversion=2008020603 Recession?

There is a view termed the ''halfway rule''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gaffen |first=David |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122635740974515379 |title=Recession Puts Halfway Rule to the Test|work=The Wall Street Journal  |date=11 November 2008 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to which investors start discounting an economic recovery about halfway through a recession. In the 16 U.S. recessions since 1919, the average length has been 13 months, although the recent recessions have been shorter. Thus, if the 2008 had recession followed the average, the downturn in the stock market would have bottomed around November 2008. The actual US stock market bottom of the 2008 recession was in March 2009.

==Politics==
Generally an administration gets credit or blame for the state of economy during its time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7215351.stm Economy puts Republicans at risk] 29 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This has caused disagreements about on how it actually started.&lt;ref&gt;[http://budget.senate.gov/democratic/press/2003/fs_bushrecession073103.pdf The Bush Recession] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204065202/http://budget.senate.gov/democratic/press/2003/fs_bushrecession073103.pdf |date=2011-02-04 }} Prepared by: Democrat staff, [[Senate Budget Committee]], 31 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In an economic cycle, a downturn can be considered a consequence of an expansion reaching an unsustainable state, and is corrected by a brief decline. Thus it is not easy to isolate the causes of specific phases of the cycle.

The 1981 recession is thought to have been caused by the tight-money policy adopted by [[Paul Volcker]], chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, before [[Ronald Reagan]] took office. Reagan supported that policy. Economist [[Walter Heller]], chairman of the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] in the 1960s, said that "I call it a Reagan-Volcker-Carter recession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922689-2,00.html Ready for a Real Downer] Monday, 23 November 1981 By GEORGE J. CHURCH&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting taming of [[inflation]] did, however, set the stage for a robust growth period during Reagan's administration.

Economists usually teach that to some degree recession is unavoidable, and its causes are not well understood. Consequently, modern [[government administration]]s attempt to take steps, also not agreed upon, to soften a recession.

==Consequences==

===Unemployment===
Unemployment is particularly high during a recession. Many economists working within the neoclassical paradigm argue that there is a [[natural rate of unemployment]] which, when subtracted from the actual rate of unemployment, can be used to calculate the negative [[GDP]] gap during a recession. In other words, unemployment never reaches 0 percent, and thus is not a negative indicator of the health of an economy unless above the "natural rate," in which case it corresponds directly to a loss in gross domestic product, or [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;The Saylor Foundation. "Unemployment Rate." pp. 1 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/SAYLOR.ORG-ECON102-UNEMPLOYMENT-RATE.pdf] Accessed 20 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business===
[[Productivity]] tends to fall in the early stages of a recession, then rises again as weaker firms close. The variation in [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]] between firms rises sharply. Recessions have also provided opportunities for [[anti-competitive]] [[merger]]s, with a negative impact on the wider economy: the suspension of [[competition policy]] in the United States in the 1930s may have extended the Great Depression.&lt;ref name="ESRC"/&gt;

===Social effects===
The [[living standards]] of people dependent on wages and [[salaries]] are not more affected by recessions than those who rely on [[fixed income]]s or [[welfare benefits]]. The loss of a job is known to have a negative impact on the stability of families, and individuals' health and well-being. Fixed income benefits receive small cuts which make it tougher to survive.&lt;ref name="ESRC"/&gt;

Until April 2009, IMF several times communicated to the press, that a global annual [[real GDP]] growth of 3.0 percent or less in their view was "...equivalent to a global recession."&lt;ref name="economist-12381879"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12381879 |title=The world economy Bad, or worse |publisher=Economist.com |date=2008-10-09 |accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

In April 2009, IMF had changed their Global recession definition to: 
* ''A decline in annual per{{nbhyph}}capita real World GDP (purchasing power parity weighted), backed up by a decline or worsening for one or more of the seven other global macroeconomic indicators: Industrial production, trade, capital flows, oil consumption, unemployment rate, per{{nbhyph}}capita investment, and per{{nbhyph}}capita consumption.''&lt;ref name="New IMF Global Recession definition"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2009/04/22/whats-a-global-recession/|title=What’s a Global Recession?|publisher=The Walstreet Journal|date=22 April 2009|accessdate=17 September 2013|first=Bob|last=Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMF WEO 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/01/pdf/text.pdf|title=World Economic Outlook - April 2009: Crisis and Recovery|format=PDF|work=Box 1.1 (page 11-14)|publisher=IMF|date=24 April 2009|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By this new definition, a total of four global recessions took place since [[World War II]]: 1975, 1982, 1991 and 2009. All of them only lasted one year, although the third would have lasted three years (1991–93) if IMF as criteria had used the normal exchange rate weighted per{{nbhyph}}capita real World GDP rather than the purchase power parity weighted per{{nbhyph}}capita real World GDP.&lt;ref name="New IMF Global Recession definition"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IMF WEO 2009"/&gt;

===Australia===
The worst recession Australia has ever suffered happened in the beginning of the 1930s. As a result of late 1920s profit issues in agriculture and cutbacks, 1931-1932 saw Australia’s biggest recession in its entire history. It fared better than other nations, that underwent [[depression (economics)|depressions]], but their poor economic states influenced Australia’s as well, that depended on them for export, as well as [[foreign investments]]. The nation also benefited from bigger productivity in manufacturing, facilitated by trade protection, which also helped with feeling the effects less.
 
Due to a credit squeeze, the economy had gone into a brief recession in 1961
Australia was facing a rising level of [[inflation]] in 1973, caused partially by the oil crisis happening in that same year, which brought inflation at a 13% increase. Economic recession hit by the middle of the year 1974, with no change in policy enacted by the government as a measure to counter the economic situation of the country. Consequently, the unemployment level rose and the trade deficit increased significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= Australian Economic Indicators | publisher = Australian Bureau of Statistics | date=27 February 1998 | url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/90a12181d877a6a6ca2568b5007b861c/d4a22ad91e0348bfca256fd3007baf93!OpenDocument }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another recession – the most recent one to date – came in the 1990s, at the beginning of the decade. It was the result of a major stock collapse in 1987, in October,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Reasons for 1990s Recession | publisher = The Age | date=2 December 2006 | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/the-real-reasons-why-it-was-the-1990s-recession-we-had-to-have/2006/12/01/1164777791623.html?page=3 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to now as [[Black Monday]]. Although the collapse was larger than the one in 1929, the global economy recovered quickly, but North America still suffered a decline in lumbering savings and loans, which led to a crisis. The recession wasn’t limited to only America, but it also affected partnering nations, such as Australia. The unemployment level increased to 10.8%, employment declined by 3.4% and the GDP also decreased as much as 1.7%. Inflation, however, was successfully reduced.

===United Kingdom===

The most recent recession to affect the United Kingdom was the [[late-2000s recession]].

===United States===

{{duplication|date=October 2013}}
According to economists, since 1854, the U.S. has encountered 32 cycles of expansions and contractions, with an average of 17 months of contraction and 38 months of expansion.&lt;ref name="nber.org" /&gt; However, since 1980 there have been only eight periods of negative economic growth over one fiscal quarter or more,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdpchg.xls|title=Percent change from preceding period - U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)|website=www.bea.gov|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and four periods considered recessions:

Official economic data shows that a substantial number of nations were in recession as of early 2009.

====United States====
The [[United States housing market correction]] (a possible consequence of [[United States housing bubble]]) and [[subprime mortgage crisis]] significantly contributed to a recession.

The [[Great Recession in the United States|2007–2009 recession]] saw private consumption fall for the first time in nearly 20 years. This indicates the depth and severity of the current recession. With consumer confidence so low, recovery takes a long time. Consumers in the U.S. have been hard hit by the current recession, with the value of their houses dropping and their pension savings decimated on the stock market. Not only have consumers watched their wealth being eroded – they are now fearing for their jobs as [[unemployment]] rises.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibisworld.com/recession2009/ Economic Crisis: When will it End?
