'''Radiohead''' are &lt;!-- This article is written in British English, which commonly treats collective nouns as plural. Please do NOT change "ARE" to "IS". Thank you. --&gt; an English [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon, Oxfordshire]], formed in 1985. The band consists of [[Thom Yorke]] (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), brothers [[Jonny Greenwood]] (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and [[Colin Greenwood]] (bass), [[Ed O'Brien]] (guitar, backing vocals) and [[Philip Selway]] (drums, percussion). They have worked with producer [[Nigel Godrich]] and cover artist [[Stanley Donwood]] since 1994.

After signing to [[EMI]] in 1991, Radiohead released their debut single "[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]" in 1992. It became a worldwide hit after the release of their debut album, ''[[Pablo Honey]]'' (1993). Their popularity and critical standing rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, ''[[The Bends]]'' (1995). Radiohead's third album, ''[[OK Computer]]'' (1997), brought them international fame; noted for its complex production and themes of [[social alienation|modern alienation]], it is often acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;Erlewine, Stephen Thomas.

''Kid A'' divided listeners but was named the best album of the decade by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]'' and the ''[[The Times|Times]].''

Radiohead's sixth album, ''[[Hail to the Thief]]'' (2003), mixed rock and electronic music with lyrics inspired by the [[War on Terror]], and was the band's final album for EMI. Their subsequent releases have pioneered alternative release platforms such as [[Pay what you want|pay-what-you-want]] and [[BitTorrent]]; Radiohead self-released their seventh album, ''[[In Rainbows]]'' (2007), as a [[music download|download]] for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, ''[[The King of Limbs]]'' (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive [[Loop (music)|looping]] and [[Sampling (music)|sampling]]. ''[[A Moon Shaped Pool]]'' (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements.

Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide by 2011.&lt;ref name="BBC Worldwide takes exclusive 2011"&gt;Jonathan, Emma.

==History==

===1985–1992: Formation and first years===
[[File:Abingdon School, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, England-23April2011.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Abingdon School, where the band formed]]
The members of Radiohead met while attending [[Abingdon School]], an independent school for boys in [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon, Oxfordshire]].&lt;ref name="MCLEAN"&gt;{{cite news|last=McLean|first=Craig|title=Don't worry, be happy|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=14 July 2003|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/06/13/1055220766407.html|accessdate=25 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guitarist and singer [[Thom Yorke]] and bassist [[Colin Greenwood]] were in the same year, guitarist [[Ed O'Brien]] and drummer [[Philip Selway]] the year above, and multi-instrumentalist [[Jonny Greenwood]], brother of Colin, two years below. In 1985, they formed On a Friday, the name referring to the band's usual rehearsal day in the school's music room.&lt;ref name="RANDALL"/&gt; Jonny was the last to join, first on harmonica and then keyboards, but soon became the lead guitarist;&lt;ref name="RANDALL"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mac Randall|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/radiohead-interview-golden-age-radiohead|title=The Golden Age of Radiohead|magazine=[[Guitar World]]|date=1 April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had previously been in another band, Illiterate Hands, with musician [[Nigel Powell]] and Yorke's brother [[Andy Yorke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lukelewis/this-is-what-radiohead-looked-like-in-the-80s|title=This Is What Radiohead Looked Like In The ’80s|work=Buzzfeed|first=Luke|last=Lewis|date=24 March 2013|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/9-photos-of-artists-before-they-hit-the-big-time|title=9 Photos Of Artists Before They Hit The Big Time|work=NME|first=Lucy|last=Jones|date=26 March 2013|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Colin, the band members picked their instruments because they wanted to play music together, rather than through an interest in the particular instrument: "It was more of a collective angle, and if you could contribute by having someone else play your instrument, then that was really cool."&lt;ref name="KELLY"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2001/0915/01091500133.html|title=Taking Music To Strange Places|last=Kelly|first=John|date=15 September 2001|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=16 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, On a Friday featured a saxophone section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1785797/on-a-friday-radiohead-in-the-80s/franchises/radiohead-week/|title=On A Friday: Radiohead In The ’80s – Stereogum|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band disliked the school's strict atmosphere—the headmaster once charged them for using a rehearsal room on a Sunday—and found solace in the school's music department. They credited their music teacher for introducing them to [[jazz]], [[film scores]], postwar [[avant-garde music]], and [[20th-century classical music]].&lt;ref name="ROSS2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.therestisnoise.com/2004/04/mahler_1.html|title=The Searchers: Radiohead's unquiet revolution|last=Ross|first=Alex|date=21 August 2001|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=14 June 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525102645/http://www.therestisnoise.com/2004/04/mahler_1.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=25 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxfordshire and the [[Thames Valley]] had an active [[independent music]] scene in the late 1980s, but it centred on [[shoegazing]] bands such as [[Ride (band)|Ride]] and [[Slowdive]].&lt;ref name="KENT"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kent|first=Nick|date=1 June 2001|title=Happy now?|authorlink=Nick Kent|magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although all but Jonny had left Abingdon by 1987 to attend university, On a Friday continued to rehearse on weekends and holidays.&lt;ref name="ROSS"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Alex|title=The Searchers|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=20 August 2001|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2001/08/20/010820fa_FACT1|accessdate=16 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214053947/http://www.therestisnoise.com/2004/04/mahler_1.html|archivedate=14 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[University of Exeter]], Yorke played with the band Headless Chickens, performing songs including future Radiohead material,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/60375-rare-footage-surfaces-of-thom-yorke-performing-high-and-dry-with-pre-radiohead-band/|title=Rare Footage Surfaces of Thom Yorke Performing "High and Dry" With Pre-Radiohead Band|last=Minsker|first=Evan|date=13 July 2015|website=Pitchfork|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and met artist [[Stanley Donwood]], who would later create artwork for the band.&lt;ref name="EYE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyestorm.com/artists/profile/Stanley_Donwood.html|title=Stanley Donwood|publisher=Eyestorm|accessdate=29 May 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516152202/http://www.eyestorm.com/artists/profile/Stanley_Donwood.html|archivedate=16 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, On a Friday regrouped, sharing a house on the corner of Magdalen Road and Ridgefield Road, Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/radiohead-reconnect-20120426|title=Radiohead Reconnect|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As On a Friday continued to perform in Oxford, including more performances at the Jericho Tavern,&lt;ref name="BBC Worldwide takes exclusive 2011" /&gt; record labels and producers became interested. [[Chris Hufford]], Slowdive's producer and co-owner of Oxford's Courtyard Studios, attended an early On a Friday concert at the Jericho Tavern.

===1992–1994: "Creep", ''Pablo Honey'' and early success===
Radiohead recorded their debut release, the ''[[Drill (EP)|Drill]]'' [[Extended play|EP]], with Chris Hufford and Bryce Edge at Courtyard Studios. Released in May 1992, its chart performance was poor. The band enlisted [[Paul Q. Kolderie|Paul Kolderie]] and [[Sean Slade]], who had worked with US indie bands [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] and [[Dinosaur Jr.]], to [[record producer|produce]] their debut album, recorded quickly in an Oxford studio in 1992.&lt;ref name="RANDALL"/&gt; With the release of the "[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]" single later that year, Radiohead began to receive attention in the British music press, not all of it favourable; ''[[NME]]'' described them as "a lily-livered excuse for a rock band",&lt;ref name="FREQUENCY"&gt;{{cite news|title=Radiohead: The right frequency|date=22 February 2001|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1182725.stm|newspaper=BBC News|accessdate=24 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Creep" was blacklisted by [[BBC Radio 1]] because it was deemed "too depressing".&lt;ref name="mel"&gt;{{cite news|title=Creepshow|newspaper=[[Melody Maker]]|date=19 December 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radiohead released their debut album, ''[[Pablo Honey]]'', in February 1993. It stalled at number 22 in the UK charts, as "Creep" and its follow-up singles "[[Anyone Can Play Guitar]]" and "[[Stop Whispering]]" failed to become hits. "[[Pop Is Dead]]", a non-album single, also sold poorly; O'Brien later called the track "a hideous mistake".&lt;ref name="popisdead-1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=GU9QmQEpLoYC&amp;pg=PT112&amp;dq=%22Pop+Is+Dead%22+radiohead&amp;hl=tr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAmoVChMIkYOPmOCIyAIVgo9yCh2GxQJC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Pop%20Is%20Dead%22%20radiohead&amp;f=false|title=Exit Music – The Radiohead Story: The Radiohead Story|author=Randall, Mac|publisher=Omnibus|year=2011|isbn=0857126954}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics compared the band's early style to the wave of [[grunge]] music popular in the early 1990s, dubbing them "[[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]-lite",&lt;ref name="SMITH"/&gt; and ''Pablo Honey'' failed to make a critical or a commercial impact upon its initial release.&lt;ref name="FREQUENCY"/&gt;

According to legend, the effects were an attempt to sabotage a song Greenwood initially disliked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Randall|first=Mac|title=Exit Music: The Radiohead Story|date=12 September 2000|pages=71–73|isbn=0-385-33393-5|publisher=Delta}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
In early 1993, Radiohead began to attract listeners elsewhere. "Creep" had been played frequently on [[Israel]]i radio by influential DJ [[Yoav Kutner]], and in March, after the song became a hit in that country, Radiohead were invited to [[Tel Aviv]] for their first gig overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rubinstein|first=Harry|title=The Radiohead&amp;nbsp;— Israel connection|newspaper=israelity.com|url=http://israelity.com/2009/01/20/the-radiohead-israel-connection/|date=20 January 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515111700/http://israelity.com/2009/01/20/the-radiohead-israel-connection/|archivedate=15 May 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, the San Francisco alternative radio station [[KITS]] added "Creep" to its playlist. Soon other radio stations along the west coast of the United States followed suit. By the time Radiohead began their first North American tour in June 1993, the music video for "Creep" was in heavy rotation on MTV.&lt;ref name="ROSS"/&gt; The song rose to number two on the US [[Modern Rock Tracks|modern rock]] chart, entered the lower reaches of the [[top 40]] pop chart, and hit number seven in the [[UK Singles Chart]] when EMI rereleased it in the UK in September.&lt;ref name="BILL"/&gt; 

===1994–1995: ''The Bends'', critical recognition and growing fanbase===

Having introduced more new songs on tour, Radiohead finished recording their second album by the end of 1994, and released ''[[The Bends]]'' in March 1995. The album was driven by dense riffs and ethereal atmospheres from the band's three guitarists, with greater use of keyboards than their debut.&lt;ref name="RANDALL" /&gt; It received stronger reviews for its songwriting and performances.&lt;ref name="FREQUENCY" /&gt; While Radiohead were seen as outsiders to the [[Britpop]] scene that dominated music media at the time, they were finally successful in their home country with ''The Bends'',&lt;ref name="KENT" /&gt; as singles "[[Fake Plastic Trees]]", "[[High and Dry]]", "[[Just (song)|Just]]", and "[[Street Spirit (Fade Out)]]" made their way to chart success; "Street Spirit" placed Radiohead in the top five for the first time. "High and Dry" became a modest hit, but Radiohead's growing fanbase was insufficient to repeat the worldwide success of "Creep". ''The Bends'' peaked at No. 88 on the US album charts, which remains Radiohead's lowest showing there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radiohead: Biography|work=Rolling Stone|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/radiohead/biography|accessdate=20 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Radiohead were satisfied with the album's reception. Jonny Greenwood said: "I think the turning point for us came about nine or twelve months after ''The Bends'' was released and it started appearing in people's [best of] polls for the end of the year.

Radiohead released their third album, ''[[OK Computer]]'', in June 1997. The album found the band experimenting with song structures and incorporating [[ambient music|ambient]], [[avant garde]] and [[electronic music|electronic]] influences, prompting ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' to call the album a "stunning art-rock tour de force".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Kemp|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/ok-computer-19970710|title=OK Computer &amp;#124; Album Reviews|work=Rolling Stone|date=10 July 1997|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiohead denied being part of the [[progressive rock]] genre, but critics began to compare their work to [[Pink Floyd]], a band whose early 1970s work influenced Greenwood's guitar parts at the time. Some compared ''OK Computer'' thematically to Floyd's bestseller ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (1973),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reising|2005|pp=208–211}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Griffiths|2004|p=109}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Buckley|2003|p=843}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Yorke said the album's lyrics were inspired by observing the "speed" of the world in the 1990s. Yorke's lyrics, embodying different characters, had expressed what one magazine called "end-of-the-millennium blues"&lt;ref name="REQ"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Subterranean Aliens|date=1 September 1997|magazine=Request Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the more personal songs of ''The Bends''.

By the mid-1990s, Radiohead began to adopt recording methods from [[hip hop]], inspired by the [[sample (music)|sampling]] work of DJ Shadow,&lt;ref name="RANDALL" /&gt; and became interested in using computers to generate sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ian|last=Gillespie|title=It all got very surreal|url=http://www.greenplastic.com/coldstorage/articles/londonfreepress.html|date=17 August 1997|newspaper=[[London Free Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other influences include the jazz of [[Miles Davis]],&lt;ref name="Zoric - Juice"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zoric|first=Lauren|date=October 2000|title=Fitter, Happier, More Productive|url=|journal=Juice|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Mingus]]&lt;ref name="Zoric - Juice"/&gt; and [[Alice Coltrane]],&lt;ref name="culturelab2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturelab.co.uk/site/templates/issue1/radioazitem_culturelab_noflash.html|title=The A-Z of Radiohead|last=Eshun|first=Kodwo|year=2002|publisher=Culture Lab|accessdate=1 April 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010703111201/http://www.culturelab.co.uk/site/templates/issue1/radioazitem_culturelab_noflash.html|archivedate=3 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; the soundtracks of [[Ennio Morricone]], 1960s rock groups such as [[the Beatles]] and [[the Beach Boys]], and [[Phil Spector]]'s "[[Wall of Sound|wall of sound]]" production.&lt;ref name="RANDALL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LAUNCH" /&gt;

The [[electronic music]] of ''Kid A'' and ''Amnesiac'' was inspired by Yorke's admiration for electronic music exemplified by [[Warp Records]] artists such as [[Aphex Twin]];&lt;ref name="ZORIC2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/friday_review/story/0,,371289,00.html|title=I think I'm meant to be dead&amp;nbsp;...|last=Zoric|first=Lauren|date=22 September 2000|work=The Guardian|accessdate=18 May 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102235438/http://www.theguardian.com/friday_review/story/0%2C%2C371289%2C00.html|archivedate=2 January 2014|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013, Yorke named Aphex Twin as his biggest influence.&lt;ref name="Splitting Atoms"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 2013|title=Splitting Atoms|url=|journal=Dazed|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kid A'' also samples early [[computer music]].&lt;ref name="SMITH" /&gt; The [[jazz]] of [[Charles Mingus]],&lt;ref name="KENT2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.followmearound.com/presscuttings.php?year=2001&amp;cutting=121|title=Happy now?|last=Kent|first=Nick|date=June 2001|publisher=[[Bauer Verlagsgruppe|Bauer]]|work=[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]]|accessdate=27 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206154836/https://www.followmearound.com/presscuttings.php?year=2001&amp;cutting=121|archivedate=6 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alice Coltrane]]&lt;ref name="culturelab2"/&gt; and [[Miles Davis]], and 1970s [[krautrock]] bands such as [[Can (band)|Can]] and [[Neu!]], were other major influences during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Lauren|last=Zoric|title=Fitter, Happier, More Productive|date=1 October 2000|magazine=[[Juice (magazine)|Juice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonny Greenwood's interest in [[20th century classical music]] also had a role, as the influence of composers [[Krzysztof Penderecki]]&lt;ref name="LAUNCH" /&gt; and [[Olivier Messiaen]] was apparent. Since the recording of ''Kid A'', Greenwood has played the [[ondes Martenot]], an early electronic instrument popularised by Messiaen.&lt;ref name="ROSS" /&gt;

Recording ''In Rainbows'', Radiohead mentioned rock, electronic, hip hop and experimental musicians as influences, including [[Björk]], [[M.I.A.

Rock bands don't do that. It's far more like a jazz mentality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/how-jazz-secretly-invaded-pop-music-7630523.html|title=How jazz secretly invaded pop music|date=11 April 2012|language=en-GB|access-date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yorke is Radiohead's principal songwriter and lyricist; songs usually begin with a sketch by Yorke, which is harmonically developed by Jonny Greenwood before the others develop their parts.&lt;ref name="New Yorker - Unquiet" /&gt; Arrangement is a collaborative effort, with all the band members having roles in the process;&lt;ref name="ECCLES"/&gt; all songs are credited to "Radiohead". The band often try several approaches to songs; for example, "[[Nude (song)|Nude]]" was first performed in the 1990s, but was not released until 2007 in a radically different arrangement.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wordmagazine.co.uk/content/music-producers|title=The Music Producers {{!}} Word Magazine|last=|first=|date=3 July 2011|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703005546/http://www.wordmagazine.co.uk/content/music-producers|archivedate=3 July 2011|deadurl=bot: unknown|access-date=16 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the band took over two decades to settle on the arrangement for "[[True Love Waits (song)|True Love Waits]]", released in 2016.&lt;ref name="Pareles"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/09/arts/music/radiohead-a-moon-shaped-pool-review.html|title=Review: In Radiohead's 'A Moon Shaped Pool,' Patient Perfectionism|last=Pareles|first=Jon|date=8 May 2016|work=|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=10 September 2016|issn=0362-4331|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Jonny Greenwood said he saw Radiohead as "just a kind of an arrangement to form songs using whatever technology suits the song. And that technology can be a cello or it can be a laptop. It's all sort of machinery when looked at in the right way."&lt;ref name="inside OK Computer" /&gt;

The ''Kid A'' and ''Amnesiac'' sessions brought a change in Radiohead's music and working methods.&lt;ref name="ECCLES" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radiohead: Biography|work=Rolling Stone|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/radiohead/biography|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since their shift from conventional rock music instrumentation toward an emphasis on electronic sound, the members have gained flexibility and now regularly switch instruments depending on the particular song requirements.&lt;ref name="ECCLES" /&gt; On ''Kid A'' and ''Amnesiac'', Yorke played keyboard and bass, while Jonny Greenwood often played [[ondes Martenot]], bassist Colin Greenwood worked on sampling, and O'Brien and Selway branched out to drum machines and digital manipulation, also finding ways to incorporate their primary instruments – guitar and percussion, respectively – into the new sound.&lt;ref name="ECCLES" /&gt; The relaxed 2003 sessions for ''Hail to the Thief'' led to a different dynamic, with Yorke saying his power in the band had been "absolutely unbalanced" and that he would "subvert everybody else's power at all costs. But&amp;nbsp;... it's actually a lot more healthy now, democracy-wise."&lt;ref name="DAL"&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Dalton|title=Are we having fun yet?|date=1 April 2004|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/04/11/1081326991553.html?from=storyrhs|newspaper=[[The Age]]|accessdate=26 March 2007|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;
