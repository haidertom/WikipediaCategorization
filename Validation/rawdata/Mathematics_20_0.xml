'''A''' ([[English alphabet#Letter names|named]] {{IPAc-en|'|e…™}}, plural ''As'', ''A's'', ''a''s, ''a's'' or ''aes''{{refn|group=nb|''Aes'' is the plural of the name of the letter. The plural of the letter itself is rendered ''A''s, A's, ''a''s, or a's.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|Weiner|1989|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}) is the first [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] and the first [[vowel]] of the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]].&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; It is similar to the [[Greek_alphabet#History|Ancient Greek letter]] [[alpha]], from which it derives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCarter|1974|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. The lowercase version can be written in two forms: the double-storey '''a''' and single-storey '''…ë'''. The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in [[italic type]].

The earliest certain ancestor of "A" is [[aleph]] (also written 'aleph), the first letter of the [[Phoenician alphabet]],&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consisted entirely of [[consonant]]s (for that reason, it is also called an [[abjad]] to distinguish it from a true [[alphabet]]). In turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a [[pictogram]] of an ox head in [[proto-Sinaitic script]]&lt;ref name=Coll&gt;{{harvnb|Hall-Quest|1997|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; influenced by [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.

By 1600 BC, the Phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. Its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] or [[Arabic script|Arabic]] aleph.

When the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter to represent the [[glottal stop]]‚Äîthe consonant sound that the letter denoted in [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] and other [[Semitic languages]], and that was the first [[phoneme]] of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter‚Äîso they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel {{IPA|/a/}}, and called it by the similar name of [[alpha]]. In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the [[Greek Dark Ages]], dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the [[Greek alphabet]] of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.

The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the [[Old Italic script|Etruscan alphabet]] to write the [[Latin|Latin language]], and the resulting letter was preserved in the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] that would come to be used to write many languages, including English.

===Typographic variants===
[[File:A-small glyphs.svg|thumb|140px|Different [[glyphs]] of the lowercase letter A.]]
During Roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter "A". First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other "permanent" media. There was also a [[cursive]] style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces. Due to the "perishable" nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as [[letter case|majuscule]] cursive, [[letter case|minuscule]] cursive, and semicursive minuscule. Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. The known variants include the early [[Uncial script#Half-uncial|semi-uncial]], the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.&lt;ref name=Americana&gt;{{harvnb|Diringer|2000|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LowercaseA.svg|left|thumb|200px|[[Allography|Typographic variants]] include a double-storey '''a''' and single-storey '''…ë'''.]]At the end of the [[Roman Empire]] (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe. Among these were the semicursive minuscule of [[Italy]], the [[Merovingian script]] in France, the [[Visigothic script]] in Spain, and the [[Insular script|Insular]] or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule of Great Britain. By the 9th century, the [[Carolingian minuscule|Caroline script]], which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.&lt;ref name=Americana/&gt;

15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today. These variants, the ''Italic'' and ''Roman'' forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italic form, also called ''script a,'' is used in most current [[handwriting]] and consists of a circle and vertical stroke. This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter [[tau]] in the hands of medieval Irish and English writers.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; The Roman form is used in most printed material; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it ("a").&lt;ref name=Americana/&gt; Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.

[[Italic type]] is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest (set in Roman type). There are some other cases aside from italic type where ''script a'' ("…ë"), also called [[Latin alpha]], is used in contrast with Latin "a" (such as in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]).

==Use in writing systems==
[[File:Pronunciation_of_the_name_of_the_letter_‚ü®a‚ü©_in_European_languages.png|thumb|Pronunciation of the name of the letter {{angbr|a}} in European languages, note that /a/ and /aÀê/ can differ phonetically between {{IPAblink|a}}, {{IPAblink|√§}}, {{IPAblink|√¶}} and {{IPAblink|…ë}} depending on the language.|305x305px]]
===English===
{{further information|Pronunciation of English ‚ü®a‚ü©}}
In modern [[English orthography]], the letter {{angbr|a}} represents at least seven different vowel sounds:
*the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/√¶/}} as in ''pad'';
*the [[open back unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/…ëÀê/}} as in ''father'', which is closer to its original Latin and Greek sound;&lt;ref name=Coll/&gt;
*the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/e…™/}} as in ''ace'' and ''major'' (usually when {{vr|a}} is followed by one, or occasionally two, consonants and then another vowel letter) ‚Äì this results from [[Middle English lengthening]] followed by the [[Great Vowel Shift]];
*the modified form of the above sound that occurs [[English-language vowel changes before historic /r/|before {{vr|r}}]], as in ''square'' and ''Mary'';
*the rounded vowel of ''water'';
*the shorter rounded vowel (not present in [[General American]]) in ''was'' and ''what'';&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;
*a [[schwa]], in many unstressed syllables, as in ''about'', ''comma'', ''solar''.

The double {{angbr|aa}} sequence does not occur in native English words, but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as ''Aaron'' and ''[[aardvark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gelb|Whiting|1998|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, {{vr|a}} occurs in [[List of Latin-script digraphs|many common digraphs]], all with their own sound or sounds, particularly {{vr|ai}}, {{vr|au}}, {{vr|aw}}, {{vr|ay}}, {{vr|ea}} and {{vr|oa}}.

{{angbr|a}} is the third-most-commonly used letter in English (after {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|t}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second most common in Spanish and French. In one study, on average, about 3.68% of letters used in English texts tend to be {{angbr|a}}, while the number is 6.22% in Spanish and 3.95% in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other languages===
In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, {{angbr|a}} denotes an open unrounded vowel, such as {{IPA|/[[Open front unrounded vowel|a]]/}}, {{IPA|/[[Open central unrounded vowel|√§]]/}}, or {{IPA|/[[Open back unrounded vowel|…ë]]/}}. An exception is [[Saanich dialect|Saanich]], in which {{angbr|a}} (and the glyph [[√Å]]) stands for a [[close-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/e/}}.

===Other systems===

In phonetic and phonemic notation:
*in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], {{angbr|{{IPA|a}}}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]], {{angbr|{{IPA|√§}}}} is used for the [[open central unrounded vowel]], and {{angbr|{{IPA|…ë}}}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].
*in [[X-SAMPA]], {{angbr|a}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]] and {{angbr|A}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].

==Other uses==
{{main article|A (disambiguation)}}
In [[algebra]], the letter ''a'' along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities, whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') are used to denote unknown quantities.

In [[geometry]], capital A, B, C etc. are used to denote [[Line segment|segment]]s, [[line (geometry)|line]]s, [[Line (geometry)#Ray|rays]], etc.&lt;ref name=Americana/&gt; A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a [[triangle]], the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A.&lt;ref name=Coll/&gt;

"A" is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; "A grade" for clean restaurants; [[A-list]] celebrities, etc. Such associations can have a [[motivation|motivating]] effect, as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ciani &amp; Sheldon|2010|pp=99‚Äì100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"A" is used as a prefix on some words, such as [[asymmetry]], to mean "not" or "without" (from Greek).

Finally, the letter A is used to denote size, as in a narrow size shoe,&lt;ref name=Coll/&gt; or a small cup size in a [[brassiere]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

'''C''' is the third [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] in the [[English alphabet]] and a letter of the [[alphabet]]s of many other [[writing system]]s which inherited it from the [[Latin alphabet]]. It is also the third letter of the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]]. It is [[English alphabet#Letter names|named]] ''cee'' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|s|iÀê}}) in [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;"C" ''Oxford English Dictionary,'' 2nd edition (1989); ''Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged'' (1993); "cee", ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

"C" comes from the same letter as "G". The [[Semitic people|Semites]] named it [[gimel]]. The sign is possibly adapted from an [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Egyptian hieroglyph]] for a [[Staff-sling|staff sling]], which may have been the meaning of the name ''gimel''. Another possibility is that it depicted a camel, the Semitic name for which was ''gamal''. [[Barry B. Powell]], a specialist in the history of writing, states "It is hard to imagine how gimel = "camel" can be derived from the picture of a camel (it may show his hump, or his head and neck!)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Powell|first=Barry B.|title=Writing: Theory and History of the Technology of Civilization|date=27 Mar 2009|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|isbn=978-1405162562|page=182|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PZ2Gr3d9X2UC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=Gimel+shaped+like+a+camel%27s+neck#v=onepage&amp;q=Gimel%20shaped%20like%20a%20camel's%20neck&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Etruscan language]], [[plosive consonant]]s had no contrastive [[phonation|voicing]], so the [[Greek language|Greek]] '[[Gamma|Œì]]' (Gamma) was adopted into the [[Old Italic script#Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan alphabet]] to represent {{IPA|/k/}}. Already in the [[Western Greek alphabet]], Gamma first took a '[[File:Early Etruscan C.gif|15px]]' form in Early Etruscan, then '[[File:Classical Etruscan C.gif|15px]]' in Classical Etruscan. In Latin it eventually took the '{{smallcaps|c}}' form in Classical Latin. In the earliest [[Latin]] inscriptions, the letters '{{smallcaps|c k q}}' were used to represent the sounds {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/…°/}} (which were not differentiated in writing).  Of these, '{{smallcaps|q}}' was used to represent {{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/…°/}} before a rounded vowel, '{{smallcaps|k}}' before '{{smallcaps|a}}', and '{{smallcaps|c}}' elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 3rd century BC, a modified character was introduced for {{IPA|/…°/}}, and '{{smallcaps|c}}' itself was retained for {{IPA|/k/}}. The use of '{{smallcaps|c}}' (and its variant '{{smallcaps|g}}') replaced most usages of '{{smallcaps|k}}' and '{{smallcaps|q}}'.  Hence, in the classical period and after, '{{smallcaps|g}}' was treated as the equivalent of Greek gamma, and '{{smallcaps|c}}' as the equivalent of kappa; this shows in the romanization of Greek words, as in 'ŒöŒëŒîŒúŒüŒ£', 'ŒöŒ•Œ°ŒüŒ£', and 'Œ¶Œ©ŒöŒôŒ£' came into Latin as '{{smallcaps|cadmvs}}', '{{smallcaps|cyrvs}}' and '{{smallcaps|phocis}}', respectively.

Other alphabets have letters [[homoglyph]]ic to 'c' but not analogous in use and derivation, like the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] letter [[Es (Cyrillic)|Es]] (–°, —Å) which derives from the lunate [[sigma (letter)|sigma]], named due to its resemblance to the crescent moon.

==Later use==
{{unreferenced|date=September 2018|section}}
When the Roman alphabet was introduced into Britain, {{angbr|c}} represented only {{IPA|/k/}}, and this value of the letter has been retained in loanwords to all the [[insular Celtic languages]]: in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]], {{angbr|c}} represents only {{IPA|/k/}}. The [[Old English Latin alphabet|Old English Latin-based writing system]] was learned from the Celts, apparently of Ireland; hence {{angbr|c}} in Old English also originally represented {{IPA|/k/}}; the Modern English words ''kin, break, broken, thick'', and ''seek,'' all come from Old English words written with {{angbr|c}}: ''cyn, brecan, brocen, √æicc'', and ''s√©oc''. But during the course of the Old English period, {{IPA|/k/}} before front vowels ({{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}}) were [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]], having changed by the tenth century to {{IPA|[t É]}}, though {{angbr|c}} was still used, as in ''cir(i)ce, wrecc(e)a''. On the continent, meanwhile, a similar phonetic change had also been going on (for example, in [[Italian language|Italian]]).

In Vulgar Latin, {{IPA|/k/}} became palatalized to {{IPA|[t É]}} in Italy and Dalmatia; in France and the Iberian peninsula, it became {{IPA|[ts]}}. Yet for these new sounds {{angbr|{{sm|c}}}} was still used before the letters {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|i}}.  The letter thus represented two distinct values. Subsequently, the Latin phoneme {{IPA|/k ∑/}} (spelled {{angbr|{{smallcaps|qv}}}}) de-labialized to {{IPA|/k/}} meaning that the various Romance languages had {{IPA|/k/}} before front vowels.  In addition, [[Norman language|Norman]] used the letter {{angbr|k}} so that the sound {{IPA|/k/}} could be represented by either {{angbr|k}} or {{angbr|c}}, the latter of which could represent either {{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/ts/}} depending on whether it preceded a front vowel letter or not. The convention of using both {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|k}} was applied to the writing of English after the [[Norman Conquest]], causing a considerable re-spelling of the Old English words. Thus while Old English ''candel, clif, corn, crop, c√∫,'' remained unchanged, ''Cent, c√¶¬¥·µπ (c√©¬¥·µπ), cyng, brece, s√©oce,'' were now (without any change of sound) spelled 'Kent', 'ke»ù', 'kyng', 'breke', and 'seoke'; even ''cniht'' ('knight') was subsequently changed to 'kniht' and ''√æic'' ('thick') changed to 'thik' or 'thikk'. The Old English 'cw' was also at length displaced by the French 'qu' so that the Old English ''cw√©n'' ('queen') and ''cwic'' ('quick') became [[Middle English]] 'quen' 'quik', respectively. The sound {{IPA|[t É]}}, to which Old English palatalized {{IPA|/k/}} had advanced, also occurred in French, chiefly from Latin {{IPA|/k/}} before 'a'. In French it was represented by the digraph {{angbr|ch}}, as in ''champ'' (from Latin ''camp-um'') and this spelling was introduced into English: the Hatton Gospels, written about 1160, have in Matt. i-iii, ''child, chyld, riche, mychel,'' for the ''cild, rice, mycel,'' of the Old English version whence they were copied. In these cases, the Old English {{angbr|c}} gave place to {{angbr|k qu ch}} but, on the other hand, {{angbr|c}} in its new value of {{IPA|/ts/}} came in largely in French words like ''processiun, emperice, grace,'' and was also substituted for 'ts' in a few Old English words, as ''miltse, bletsien,'' in early Middle English ''milce, blecien''. By the end of the thirteenth century both in France and England, this sound {{IPA|/ts/}} de-affricated to {{IPA|/s/}}; and from that time {{angbr|c}} has represented {{IPA|/s/}} before front vowels either for [[etymology|etymological]] reasons, as in ''lance, cent,'' or to avoid the ambiguity due to the "etymological" use of {{angbr|s}} for {{IPA|/z/}}, as in ''ace, mice, once, pence, defence''.

Thus, to show etymology, English spelling has ''advise'', ''devise'' (instead of ''advize'', ''devize''), while ''advice, device, dice, ice, mice, twice,'' etc., do not reflect etymology; example has extended this to ''hence, pence, defence,'' etc., where there is no etymological reason for using {{angbr|c}}. Former generations also wrote ''{{lang|en|sence}}'' for ''sense''. Hence, today the [[Romance languages]] and [[English language|English]] have a common feature inherited from [[Vulgar Latin]] spelling conventions where {{angbr|c}} takes on either a [[Hard and soft C|"hard" or "soft"]] value depending on the following letter.

==Use in writing systems==
{{unreferenced|date=September 2018|section}}
===English===
In [[English orthography]], {{angbr|c}} generally represents the "soft" value of {{IPAc-en|s}} before the letters {{angbr|e}} (including the Latin-derived digraphs {{angbr|ae}} and {{angbr|oe}}, or the corresponding ligatures {{angbr|√¶}} and {{angbr|≈ì}}), {{angbr|i}}, and {{angbr|y}}, and a "hard" value of {{IPAc-en|k}} before any other letters or at the end of a word. However, there are a number of exceptions in English: "[[soccer]]" and "[[Pronunciation of Celtic|Celt]]" are words that have {{IPAc-en|k}} where {{IPAc-en|s}} would be expected.

The "soft" {{angbr|c}} may represent the {{IPAc-en| É}} sound in the digraph {{angbr|ci}} when this precedes a vowel, as in the words 'delicious' and 'appreciate', and also in the word "ocean" and its derivatives.

The digraph {{angbr|[[Ch (digraph)|ch]]}} most commonly represents {{IPAc-en|t É}}, but can also represent {{IPAc-en|k}} (mainly in words of [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] origin) or {{IPAc-en| É}} (mainly in words of [[French language|French]] origin). For some dialects of English, it may also represent {{IPAc-en|x}} in words like ''loch'', while other speakers pronounce the final sound as {{IPAc-en|k}}. The trigraph {{angbr|tch}} always represents {{IPAc-en|t É}}.

The digraph {{angbr|ck}} is often used to represent the sound {{IPAc-en|k}}  after short vowels.

===Other languages===
In the Romance languages [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], {{angbr|c}} generally has a "hard" value of {{IPA|/k/}} and a "soft" value whose pronunciation varies by language. In French, Portuguese, Catalan and Spanish from Latin America and southern Spain, the soft {{angbr|c}} value is {{IPA|/s/}} as it is in English.  In the Spanish spoken in northern and central Spain, the soft {{angbr|c}} is a [[voiceless dental fricative]] {{IPA|/Œ∏/}}. In [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]], the soft {{angbr|c}} is {{IPA|[tÕ° É]}}.

All [[Balto-Slavic languages]] that use the Latin alphabet, as well as [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], several [[Sami languages]], [[Esperanto language|Esperanto]], [[Ido language|Ido]], [[Interlingua language|Interlingua]], and [[Americanist phonetic notation]] (and those [[Indigenous languages of North America|aboriginal languages of North America]] whose practical orthography derives from it) use {{angbr|c}} to represent {{IPA|/tÕ°s/}}, the [[voiceless alveolar sibilant affricate|voiceless alveolar]] or [[voiceless dental sibilant affricate]]. In [[Pinyin|romanized]] [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], the letter represents an aspirated version of this sound, {{IPA|/tÕ°s ∞/}}.

Among non-European languages that have adopted the Latin alphabet, {{angbr|c}} represents a variety of sounds. [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik language|Yup'ik]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Malay language|Malay]], and a number of African languages such as [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Fula language|Fula]], and [[Manding languages|Manding]] share the soft Italian value of {{IPA|/tÕ° É/}}.  In [[Azeri language|Azeri]], [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]], [[Northern Kurdish|Kurmanji Kurdish]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] {{angbr|c}} stands for the voiced counterpart of this sound, the [[voiced postalveolar affricate]] {{IPA|/dÕ° í/}}. In [[Yabem language|Yabem]] and similar languages, such as [[Bukawa language|Bukawa]], {{angbr|c}} stands for a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/ î/}}. [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]] use this letter to represent the click {{IPA|/«Ä/}}. In some other African languages, such as Beninese [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], {{angbr|c}} is used for {{IPA|/ É/}}. In [[Fijian language|Fijian]], {{angbr|c}} stands for a [[voiced dental fricative]] {{IPA|/√∞/}}, while in [[Somali language|Somali]] it has the value of {{IPA|/[[Voiced pharyngeal fricative| ï]]/}}.

The letter {{angbr|c}} is also used as a transliteration of Cyrillic {{angbr|—Ü}} in the Latin forms of [[Serbian alphabet|Serbian]], [[Romanisation of Macedonian|Macedonian]], and sometimes [[Romanization of Ukrainian|Ukrainian]], along with the digraph {{angbr|ts}}.

===Other systems===
As a [[phonetic]] symbol, lowercase {{angbr|{{IPA|c}}}} is the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) and [[X-SAMPA]] symbol for the [[voiceless palatal plosive]], and capital {{angbr|C}} is the X-SAMPA symbol for the [[voiceless palatal fricative]].

===Digraphs===
There are several common digraphs with {{angbr|c}}, the most common being {{angbr|[[Ch (digraph)|ch]]}}, which in some languages (such as [[German language|German]]) is far more common than {{angbr|c}} alone. {{angbr|ch}} takes various values in other languages.

As in English, {{angbr|ck}}, with the value {{IPA|/k/}}, is often used after short vowels in other [[Germanic languages]] such as German and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (but some other Germanic languages use {{angbr|kk}} instead, such as Dutch and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]). The digraph {{angbr|cz}} is found in Polish and {{angbr|cs}} in Hungarian, both representing {{IPA|/tÕ° É/}}. The digraph {{angbr|sc}} represents {{IPA|/ É/}} in Old English, Italian, and a few languages related to Italian (where this only happens before [[front vowel]]s, while otherwise it represents {{IPA|/sk/}}). The trigraph {{angbr|sch}} represents {{IPA|/ É/}} in German.

The Semitic letter [[Daleth|DƒÅleth]] may have developed from the [[logogram]] for a fish or a door. There are many different [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s that might have inspired this. In Semitic, Ancient Greek and Latin, the letter represented {{IPA|/d/}}; in the [[Etruscan alphabet]] the letter was superfluous but still retained (see letter [[B]]). The equivalent [[Greek letter]] is Delta, [[Delta (letter)|Œî]].

The [[Lower case|minuscule]] (lower-case) form of 'd' consists of a loop and a tall [[Vertical direction|vertical]] stroke. It developed by gradual variations on the majuscule (capital) form. In handwriting, it was common to start the arc to the left of the vertical stroke, resulting in a [[serif]] at the top of the arc. This serif was extended while the rest of the letter was reduced, resulting in an angled stroke and loop. The angled stroke slowly developed into a vertical  stroke.

==Use in writing systems==
[[File:Boundary stone on the Demeljoch - 2.jpg|thumb|The letter D, standing for "Deutschland" ([[German language|German]] for "[[Germany]]"), on a [[boundary stone]] at the border between Austria and Germany.]] 
In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, and in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], {{angbr|d}} generally represents the [[voiced alveolar plosive|voiced alveolar]] or [[voiced dental plosive]] {{IPA|/d/}}. However, in the [[Vietnamese alphabet]], it represents the sound {{IPA|/z/}} in northern dialects or {{IPA|/j/}} in southern dialects. (See [[D with stroke]] and [[Dz (digraph)]].) In [[Fijian language|Fijian]] it represents a [[prenasalized consonant|prenasalized]] stop {{IPA|/nd/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Pacific languages: an introduction |first=John |last=Lynch |page=97 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYfV1jN3whUC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=d+fijian+prenasalized#v=onepage&amp;q=d%20fijian%20prenasalized&amp;f=false |year=1998 |publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]] |isbn=0-8248-1898-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some languages where [[voice (phonetics)|voice]]less [[aspiration (phonetics)|unaspirated]] stops contrast with voiceless aspirated stops, {{angbr|d}} represents an unaspirated {{IPA|/t/}}, while {{angbr|t}} represents an aspirated {{IPA|/t ∞/}}. Examples of such languages include [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Scottish Gaelic]], [[Navajo language|Navajo]] and the [[Pinyin]] transliteration of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]].

The Latin letter 'E' differs little from its source, the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letter [[epsilon]], 'Œï'. This in turn comes from the [[Semitic alphabet|Semitic]] letter ''[[He (letter)|h√™]]'', which has been suggested to have started as a praying or calling human figure (''[[hillul]]'' 'jubilation'), and was probably based on a similar [[Egyptian hieroglyph]] that indicated a different pronunciation. In Semitic, the letter represented {{IPA|/h/}} (and {{IPA|/e/}} in foreign words); in Greek, ''h√™'' became the letter epsilon, used to represent {{IPA|/e/}}.  The various forms of the [[Old Italic script]] and the [[Latin alphabet]] followed this usage.

[[File:Pronunciation_of_the_name_of_the_letter_‚ü®e‚ü©_in_European_languages.png|thumb|Pronunciation of the name of the letter {{angbr|e}} in European languages|305x305px]]

===English===
Although [[Middle English]] spelling used {{angbr|e}} to represent long and short {{IPAslink|e}}, the [[Great Vowel Shift]] changed long /eÀê/ (as in 'me' or 'bee') to /iÀê/ while short {{IPAslink|…õ}} (as in 'met' or 'bed') remained a [[mid vowel]]. In other cases, the letter is [[Silent e|silent]], generally at the end of words.

In the orthography of many languages it represents either {{IPAblink|e}}, {{IPAblink|eÃû}},  {{IPAblink|…õ}}, or some variation (such as a [[Nasal vowel|nasalized]] version) of these sounds, often with diacritics (as: {{angle bracket|e [[√™]] [[√©]] [[√®]] [[√´]] [[ƒì]] [[ƒï]] [[ƒõ]] [[·∫Ω]] [[ƒó]] [[·∫π]] [[ƒô]] [[·∫ª]]}}) to indicate contrasts.  Less commonly, as in French, German, or Saanich, {{angbr|e}} represents a [[mid-central vowel]] /…ô/. [[Digraph (orthography)|Digraphs]] with {{angbr|e}} are common to indicate either [[diphthong]]s or [[monophthong]]s, such as {{angbr|ea}} or {{angbr|ee}} for {{IPA|/iÀê/}} or {{IPA|/e…™/}} in English, {{angbr|ei}} for {{IPA|/a…™/}} in [[German language|German]], and {{angbr|eu}} for {{IPA|/√∏/}} in [[French language|French]] or {{IPA|/…î…™/}} in German.

===Other systems===
The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] uses {{angbr|{{IPA|e}}}} for the [[close-mid front unrounded vowel]] or the [[mid front unrounded vowel]].

==Most common letter==
'E' is the most common (or highest-[[Frequency (statistics)|frequency]]) letter in the English alphabet (starting off the typographer's phrase [[ETAOIN SHRDLU]]) and several other European [[languages]], which has implications in both [[cryptography]] and [[data compression]]. In the story "[[The Gold-Bug]]" by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], a character figures out a random character code by remembering that the most used letter in English is E. This makes it a hard and popular letter to use when writing [[lipogram]]s. [[Ernest Vincent Wright]]'s ''[[Gadsby (novel)|Gadsby]]'' (1939) is considered a "dreadful" novel, and supposedly "at least part of Wright's narrative issues were caused by language limitations imposed by the lack of ''E''."&lt;ref&gt;Ross Eckler, ''Making the Alphabet Dance: Recreational Word Play''. New York: St. Martin's Press (1996): 3&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Georges Perec]]'s novel ''[[A Void (novel)|A Void]]'' (''La Disparition'') (1969) and its English translation by Gilbert Adair omit 'e' and are considered better works.&lt;ref&gt;Eckler (1996): 3. Perec's novel "was so well written that at least some reviewers never realized the existence of a letter constraint."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''I''' ([[English alphabet#Letter names|named]] ''i'' {{IPAc-en|a…™}}, plural ''ies'')&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Kiddle (1870) ''The institutes of English grammar'', p. 19. &lt;br&gt;''Ies'' is the plural of the English name of the letter; the plural of the letter itself is rendered I's, ''I''s, i's, or ''i''s.&lt;/ref&gt; is the ninth [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] and the third [[vowel]] in the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]].

In the [[Phoenician alphabet]], the letter may have originated in a [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]] for an arm that represented a [[voiced pharyngeal fricative]] ({{IPA|/ ï/}}) in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], but was reassigned to {{IPA|/j/}} (as in English "'''y'''es") by Semites, because their word for "arm" began with that sound. This letter could also be used to represent {{IPA|/i/}}, the [[close front unrounded vowel]], mainly in foreign words.

The Greeks adopted a form of this [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] ''yodh'' as their letter ''[[iota]]'' ({{angle bracket|Œô, Œπ}}) to represent {{IPA|/i/}}, the same as in the [[Old Italic alphabet]]. In Latin (as in Modern Greek), it was also used to represent {{IPA|/j/}} and this use persists in the languages     that descended from Latin. The modern letter '[[j]]' originated as a variation of 'i', and both were used interchangeably for both the vowel and the consonant, coming to be differentiated only in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=UofD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mysite.du.edu/~etuttle/classics/latalph.htm|title=The Latin Alphabet|work=du.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dot over the lowercase 'i' is sometimes called a ''[[tittle]]''.  In the [[Turkish alphabet]], [[dotted and dotless I]] are considered separate letters, representing a front and back vowel, respectively, and both have uppercase ('I', '[[Dotted and dotless I|ƒ∞]]') and lowercase ('ƒ±', 'i') forms.

==Use in writing systems==

===English===
In Modern English [[English orthography|spelling]], {{angbr|i}} represents several different sounds, either the diphthong {{IPAc-en|a…™}} ("long" {{angbr|i}}) as in ''kite'', the short {{IPAc-en|…™}} as in ''bill'', or the {{angbr|ee}} sound {{IPAc-en|iÀê}} in the last syllable of ''machine''. The diphthong {{IPA|/a…™/}} developed from [[Middle English]] {{IPA|/iÀê/}} through a series of vowel shifts. In the [[Great Vowel Shift]], Middle English {{IPA|/iÀê/}} changed to [[Early Modern English]] {{IPA|/ei/}}, which later changed to {{IPA|/…ôi/}} and finally to the Modern English diphthong {{IPA|/a…™/}} in [[General American]] and [[Received Pronunciation]]. Because the diphthong {{IPA|/a…™/}} developed from a Middle English long vowel, it is called "long" {{angbr|i}} in traditional English grammar.{{citation needed|reason=These facts come from reliable sources, but they need to be cited specifically. One source on pronunciation of i, another on the Great Vowel Shift and later vowel changes, and a third on traditional English grammatical terminology.|date=April 2015}} &lt;!-- Note that technically, the term "long i" relates to phonology, orthography, and phonics, but not "grammar" strictly speaking --&gt;

The letter, {{angbr|i}}, is the fifth most common letter in the [[English language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2003-2004/cryptography/subs/frequencies.html|title=Frequency Table|work=cornell.edu|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English first-person singular nominative pronoun is "I", pronounced  {{IPAc-en|a…™}} and always written with a capital letter. This pattern arose for basically the same reason that lowercase {{angbr|i}} acquired a dot: so it wouldn't get lost in manuscripts before the age of printing:

{{quote|The capitalized ‚ÄúI‚Äù first showed up about 1250 in the northern and midland dialects of England, according to the ''Chambers Dictionary of Etymology''.

''Chambers'' notes, however, that the capitalized form didn‚Äôt become established in the south of England ‚Äúuntil the 1700s (although it appears sporadically before that time).

Capitalizing the pronoun, ''Chambers'' explains, made it more distinct, thus ‚Äúavoiding misreading handwritten manuscripts.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O‚ÄôConner|first1=Patricia T.|last2=Kellerman|first2=Stewart|title=Is capitalizing "I" an ego thing?|url=http://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2011/08/capital.html|website=Grammarphobia|accessdate=23 December 2014|date=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Other languages===
In many languages' orthographies, {{angbr|i}} is used to represent the sound {{IPA|/i/}} or, more rarely, {{IPA|/…™/}}.

==Forms and variants==
{{see also|History of the Latin alphabet|Dotted and dotless I}}

In some [[sans serif]] [[typefaces]], the uppercase letter I, 'I' may be difficult to distinguish from the lowercase [[L|letter L]], 'l', the [[vertical bar|vertical bar character]] '|', or the [[1 (number)|digit one]] '1'. In serifed typefaces, the capital form of the letter has both a baseline and a cap-height serif, while the lowercase L generally has a hooked ascender and a baseline serif.

The uppercase I does not have a dot ([[tittle]]) while the lowercase i has one in most Latin-derived alphabets. However, some schemes, such as the [[Turkish alphabet]], have two kinds of I: [[Dotted and dotless I|dotted (ƒ∞i) and dotless (Iƒ±)]].

The uppercase I has two kinds of shapes, with serifs ([[File:I with crossbars.svg|x15px]]) and without serifs ([[File:I without crossbars.svg|x15px]]). Usually these are considered equivalent, but they are distinguished in some extended Latin alphabet systems, such as the [[African reference alphabet#1978 version|1978 version of the African reference alphabet]]. In that system, the former is the uppercase counterpart of [[…™]] and the latter is the counterpart of 'i'.

The letter '''M''' is derived from the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] [[Mem]], via the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[Mu (letter)|Mu]] (Œú,&amp;nbsp;Œº). [[Semitic alphabets|Semitic]] Mem is most likely derived from a "[[Proto-Sinaitic_script|Proto-Sinaitic]]"  (Bronze Age) adoption of the  [[N-water ripple (n hieroglyph)|"water" ideogram]] in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Egyptian writing]]. The Egyptian sign had the acrophonic value {{IPA|/n/}}, from the Egyptian word for "water", ''nt''; the adoption as the Semitic letter for {{IPA|/m/}} was presumably also on [[acrophonic]] grounds, from the Semitic word for "water", ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Semitic/ma æ-|*mƒÅ(y)-]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See F. Simons, "Proto-Sinaitic ‚Äî Progenitor of the Alphabet" ''Rosetta'' 9 (2011):
Figure Two: "Representative selection of proto-Sinaitic characters with comparison to Egyptian hieroglyphs", (p. 38)
Figure Three: "Chart of all early proto-Canaanite letters with comparison to proto-Sinaitic signs" (p. 39),
Figure Four: "Representative selection of later proto-Canaanite letters with comparison to early proto-Canaanite and proto-Sinaitic signs" (p. 40). See also: Goldwasser (2010), following Albright (1966), "Schematic Table of Proto-Sinaitic Characters" ([http://www.apocalypse2008-2015.com/images/Proto-Sinaitic_Table.gif fig. 1]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in writing systems==
The letter {{angbr|m}} represents the [[bilabial nasal]] consonant sound {{IPAblink|m}} in the orthography of Latin as well as in that of many modern [[language]]s, and also in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]. In English, the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (first edition) says that {{angbr|m}} is sometimes a [[vowel]] in words like ''spasm'' and in the [[suffix]] ''-ism''. In modern terminology, this is described as a [[syllabic consonant]] (IPA {{IPA|[mÃ©]}}).

==Other uses==
The [[Roman numeral]] ‚ÖØ represents the number [[1000 (number)|1000]], though it was not used in Roman times. There is, however, scant evidence that the letter was later introduced in the early centuries by the Romans. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywI6SDUggk4C&amp;q=ix#v=snippet&amp;q=%22roman%20numerals%22&amp;f=false | title=Illustrated Introduction to Latin Epigraphy | publisher=[[University of California Press]] | date=1983 | accessdate=3 October 2015 | author=Gordon, Arthur E. | pages=45| isbn=9780520038981 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most common [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]], [[snake]], was used  in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] writing to stand for a sound like the English {{angbr|[[J]]}}, because the Egyptian word for "snake" was ''djet''. It is speculated by many{{who|date=November 2016}} that [[Semitic people]] working in Egypt adapted hieroglyphics to create the first [[alphabet]], and that they used the same snake symbol to represent N, because their word for "snake" may have begun with that sound. However, the name for the letter in the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], [[Hebrew]], [[Aramaic]] and [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] alphabets is ''[[Nun (letter)|nun]]'', which means "[[fish]]" in some of these languages. The sound value of the letter was {{IPA|/n/}}‚Äîas in [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], [[Latin]] and modern languages.

==Use in writing systems==
{{angbr|n}} represents a [[dental nasal|dental]] or [[alveolar nasal]] in virtually all languages that use the Latin alphabet, and in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]. A common [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] with {{angbr|n}} is {{angbr|ng}}, which represents a [[velar nasal]] in a variety of languages, usually positioned word-finally in [[English language|English]]. Often, before a [[velar stop|velar plosive]] (as in ''ink'' or ''jungle''), {{angbr|n}} alone represents a [[velar nasal]]. In Italian and French, {{angbr|gn}} represents a [[palatal nasal]] {{IPA|/…≤/}}. The [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] spelling for this sound is {{angbr|nh}}, while [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Breton language|Breton]], and a few other languages use the letter {{angbr|[[√±]]}}. In English, {{angbr|n}} is generally silent when it is preceded by an {{angbr|m}} at the end of words, as in ''hymn''; however, it is pronounced in this combination when occurring word medially, as in ''hymnal''.

{{angbr|n}} is the sixth most [[Letter frequency|common letter]] and the second-most commonly used [[consonant]] in the [[English language]] (after {{angbr|t}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2003-2004/cryptography/subs/frequencies.html English Letter Frequency]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
In [[mathematics]], the italic form ''n'' is a particularly common symbol for a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] quantity which represents an [[integer]].

===Antiquity===
[[File:Prognatus.png|thumb|The word ''prognatus'' as written on the [[Sarcophagus of Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus]] (280 BC) reveals the full development of the Latin ''R'' by that time; the letter ''P'' at the same time still retains its archaic shape distinguishing it from Greek or Old Italic ''rho''.]]
The original [[Semitic alphabets|Semitic]] letter may have been inspired by an [[Egyptian hieroglyph]] for ''tp'', "head".{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} It was used for {{IPA|/r/}} by Semites because in their language, the word for "head" was ''[[r√™≈°]]'' (also the name of the letter).  It developed into Greek '[[Rho (letter)|Œ°]]' {{lang|grc|·ø•·ø∂}} (''rh√¥'') and Latin R.

The descending diagonal stroke develops as a graphic variant in some [[Western Greek alphabets]] (writing ''rho'' as [[File:Greek Rho 03.svg|20px|]]), but it was not adopted in most [[Old Italic alphabet]]s; most Old Italic alphabets show variants of their ''rho'' between a "P" and a "D" shape, but without the Western Greek descending stroke. 
Indeed, the oldest known forms of the Latin alphabet itself of the 7th to 6th centuries BC, in the [[Duenos Inscription|Duenos]] and the [[Forum inscription]], still write ''r'' using the "P"&lt;!--êåìŒ°--&gt; shape of the letter.
The [[Lapis Satricanus]] inscription shows the form of the Latin alphabet around 500 BC. Here, the rounded, closing Œ† shape of the ''p'' &lt;!--êåê--&gt; and the Œ° shape of the ''r'' have become difficult to distinguish. 
The descending stroke of the Latin letter R has fully developed by the 3rd century BC, as seen in the [[Tomb of the Scipios]] sarcophagus inscriptions of that era. From around 50 AD, the letter ''P'' would be written with its loop fully closed, assuming the shape formerly taken by ''R''.

[[File:Weltchronik Fulda Aa88 001r detail3.jpg|left|thumb|Late medieval illuminated initial]]

===Cursive===
[[File:Caslon-specimen-1763-double-pica-black.jpg|thumb|18th-century example of use of ''r rotunda'' in English blackletter typography]]
[[File:Luca Pacioli, De divina proportione, Letter R.jpg|thumb|Letter ''R'' from the alphabet by [[Luca Pacioli]], in ''[[De divina proportione]]'' (1509)]]

The minuscule (lowercase) form (''r'') developed through several variations on the capital form. 
Along with Latin minuscule writing in general, it developed  ultimately from [[Roman cursive]] via the [[uncial]] script of Late Antiquity into the [[Carolingian minuscule]] of the 9th century.

In handwriting, it was common not to close the bottom of the loop but continue into the leg, saving an extra pen stroke. The loop-leg stroke shortened into the simple arc used in the Carolingian minuscule and until today.

A calligraphic minuscule ''r'', known as [[r rotunda]] (Íùõ), was used in the sequence ''or'', bending the shape of the ''r'' to accommodate the bulge of the ''o'' (as in ''oÍùõ'' as opposed to ''or''). Later, the same variant was also used where ''r'' followed other lower case letters with a rounded loop towards the right (such as ''b, h, p'') and to write the geminate ''rr'' (as ''ÍùõÍùõ''). Use of ''r rotunda'' was mostly tied to [[blackletter]] typefaces, and the glyph fell out of use along with blackletter fonts in English language contexts mostly by the 18th century.

[[Insular script]] used a minuscule which retained two downward strokes, but which did not close the loop ("Insular ''r''", ÍûÉ); this variant survives in the [[Gaelic type]] popular in Ireland until the mid-20th century (but now mostly limited to decorative purposes).

==Name==
The name of the letter in Latin was ''er'' ({{IPA|/…õr/}}), following the pattern of other letters representing [[continuant]]s, such as F, L, M, N and S.  This name is preserved in [[French language|French]] and many other languages.  In [[Middle English]], the name of the letter changed from {{IPA|/…õr/}} to {{IPA|/ar/}}, following a pattern exhibited in many other words such as ''farm'' (compare French ''ferme''), and ''star'' (compare German ''Stern'').

In [[Hiberno-English]] the letter is called {{IPA|/…ír/|}} or {{IPA|/…îÀêr/|}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digilib.k.utb.cz/bitstream/handle/10563/9938/kr%C3%B6merov%C3%A1_2009_bp.pdf?sequence=1|title=Analysis of selected contemporary Irish dialects

{{anchor|Dog's letter}}
The letter R is sometimes referred to as the ''littera canina'' (canine letter). This phrase has Latin origins: the Latin R was [[trill consonant|trilled]] to sound like a growling dog. A good example of a trilling R is the Spanish word for dog, ''perro''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordsmith.org/words/dogs_letter.html |title=A Word A Day: Dog's letter |website=Wordsmith.org |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', such a reference is made by Juliet's nurse in Act 2, scene 4, when she calls the letter R "the dog's name". The reference is also found in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''English Grammar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Use in writing systems==

===English===
The letter {{angbr|r}} is the eighth most common letter in [[English language|English]] and the fourth-most common consonant (after {{angbr|t}}, {{angbr|n}}, and {{angbr|s}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2003-2004/cryptography/subs/frequencies.html|title=Frequency Table|website=Math.cornell.edu|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter {{angbr|r}} is used to form the ending "-re", which is used in certain words such as ''centre'' in some varieties of English spelling, such as [[British English]]. [[Canadian English]] also uses the "-re" ending, unlike [[American English]], where the ending is usually replaced by "-er" (''center''). This does not affect pronunciation.

===Other languages===
{{angbr|r}} represents a [[rhotic consonant]] in many languages, as shown in the table below.

Other languages may use the letter {{angbr|r}} in their alphabets (or Latin transliterations schemes) to represent rhotic consonants different from the alveolar trill. In [[Haitian Creole]], it represents a sound so weak that it is often written interchangeably with {{angbr|w}}, e.g. 'Kweyol' for 'Kreyol'.

Brazilian [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] has a great number of allophones of {{IPAslink| Å}} such as {{IPAblink|œá}}, {{IPAblink|h}}, {{IPAblink|…¶}}, {{IPAblink|x}}, {{IPAblink|…£}}, {{IPAblink|…π}} and {{IPAblink|r}}, the latter three ones can be used only in certain contexts ({{IPAblink|…£}} and {{IPAblink|r}} as {{angbr|rr}}; {{IPAblink|…π}} in the syllable coda, as an allophone of {{IPAslink|…æ}} according to the European Portuguese norm and {{IPAslink| Å}} according to the Brazilian Portuguese norm). Usually at least two of them are present in a single dialect, such as [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s {{IPAblink| Å}}, {{IPAblink|œá}}, {{IPAblink|…¶}} and, for a few speakers, {{IPAblink|…£}}.

===Other systems===
The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] uses several variations of the letter to represent the different rhotic consonants; {{angbr|{{IPA|r}}}} represents the [[alveolar trill]].

'''S''' ([[English alphabet#Letter names|named]] ''ess'' {{IPAc-en|…õ|s}},&lt;ref&gt;Spelled 'es'- in compound words&lt;/ref&gt; plural ''esses''&lt;ref&gt;"S", ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]],'' 2nd edition (1989); ''Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged'' (1993); "ess," op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;) is the 19th [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] in the [[English alphabet|Modern English alphabet]] and the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]].

==History==
===Origin===
{{see|Shin (letter)|Sigma|San (letter)|Sho (letter)}}

[[Northwest Semitic abjad|Northwest Semitic]] [[Shin (letter)|≈°√Æn]]  represented a [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|/ É/}} (as in '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''sh''ip'). It originated most likely as a pictogram of a tooth ({{lang|sem|[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Semitic/≈°inn-|◊©◊†◊ê]]}}) and represented the phoneme {{IPA|/ É/}} via the acrophonic principle.&lt;ref&gt;"corresponds etymologically (in part, at least) to original Semitic ''·πØ'' (th), which was pronounced ''s'' in South Canaanite"  Albright, W. F., "The Early Alphabetic Inscriptions from Sinai and their Decipherment," Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 110 (1948), p. 15. The interpretation as "tooth" is now prevalent, but not entirely certain. The ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' of 1972 reported that the letter represented a "composite bow".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Greek|Greek]] did not have a  {{IPA|/ É/}} phoneme, so the derived Greek letter [[Sigma (letter)|Sigma]] (Œ£) came to represent the [[voiceless alveolar sibilant]] {{IPA|/s/}}. 
While the letter shape Œ£ continues Phoenician ''≈°√Æn'', its name ''sigma'' is taken from the letter ''[[samekh]]'', while the shape of ''samekh'' but name and position of ''≈°√Æn'' is continued in the ''[[Œû|xi]]''. {{fact|date=June 2017}}
Within Greek, the name of ''sigma'' was influenced by its association with the Greek word œÉŒØŒ∂œâ (earlier ''*sigj-'') "to hiss". The original name of the letter "sigma" may have been ''san'', but due to the complicated early history of the Greek epichoric alphabets, "san" came to be identified as a separate letter, [[San (letter)|œ∫]].&lt;ref&gt;Woodard, Roger D. (2006). "Alphabet". In Wilson, Nigel Guy. Encyclopedia of ancient Greece. London: Routldedge. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] reports that "San" was the name given by the  [[Doric Greek|Dorians]] to the same letter called "Sigma" by the [[Ionic Greek|Ionians]].&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|grc|‚Ä¶œÑ·Ω†œÖœÑ·Ω∏ Œ≥œÅŒ¨ŒºŒºŒ±, œÑ·Ω∏ ŒîœâœÅŒπŒ≠ŒµœÇ Œº·Ω≤ŒΩ œÉ·Ω∞ŒΩ Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒ≠ŒøœÖœÉŒπ ,·ººœâŒΩŒµœÇ Œ¥·Ω≤ œÉŒØŒ≥ŒºŒ±}}" ('‚Ä¶the same letter, which the Dorians call "San", but the Ionians "Sigma"‚Ä¶'; Herodotus, ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 1.139); cf. Nick Nicholas, [http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/nonattic.html ''Non-Attic letters''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120628161421/http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/nonattic.html |date=2012-06-28 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Western Greek alphabet]] used in [[Cumae]] was adopted by the [[Etruscans]] and [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]] in the 7th century BC, over the following centuries developing into a range of [[Old Italic alphabets]] including the [[Etruscan alphabet]] and the early [[Latin alphabet]].
In [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], the value {{IPA|/s/}} of Greek sigma (êåî) was maintained, while san (êåë)
represented a separate phoneme, most likely {{IPA|/ É/}} (transliterated as ''≈õ''). 
The early Latin alphabet adopted sigma, but not san, as Old Latin did not have a  {{IPA|/ É/}} phoneme.

The shape of Latin S arises from Greek Œ£ by dropping one out of the four strokes of that letter.
The (angular) S-shape composed of three strokes existed as a variant of the four-stroke letter Œ£ already in the epigraphy in [[Archaic Greek alphabets|Western Greek alphabets]], and the three and four strokes variants existed alongside one another in the classical Etruscan alphabet. In other [[Old Italic script|Italic alphabets]] (Venetic, Lepontic), the letter could be represented as a zig-zagging line of any number between three and six strokes.

The Italic letter was also adopted into [[Elder Futhark]], as ''[[Sowil≈ç]]'' ({{script|Runr|·õä}}), and appears with four to eight strokes in the earliest runic inscriptions, but is occasionally reduced to three strokes ({{script|Runr|·õã}}) from the later 5th century, and appears regularly with three strokes in [[Younger Futhark]].

===Long s===
[[File:Schw√§bische Bastarda 1496 Schriftprobe Priesters Tochter.png|thumb|Late medieval German script (Swabian [[bastarda]], dated 1496) illustrating the use of long and round ''s'': ''prie≈øters tochter'' ("priest's daughter").]]
{{main|long s}}

The [[lower case|minuscule form]]  ≈ø, called the [[long s|long ''s'']], developed in the early medieval period, within the [[Visigothic script|Visigothic]] and [[Carolingian minuscule|Carolingian]] hands, with predecessors in the [[half-uncial]] and [[Roman cursive|cursive]] scripts of [[Late Antiquity]]. It remained standard in western writing throughout the medieval period and was adopted in early printing with movable types. 
It existed alongside minuscule "round" or "short" ''s'', which was at the time only used at the end of words.

In most western orthographies, the ≈ø gradually fell out of use during the second half of the 18th century, although it remained in occasional use into the 19th century.
In Spain, the change was mainly accomplished between the years 1760 and 1766. In France, the change occurred between 1782 and 1793. Printers in the United States stopped using the long ''s'' between 1795 and 1810. In English orthography, the London printer [[John Bell (publisher)|John Bell]] (1745‚Äì1831) pioneered the change. His edition of Shakespeare, in 1785, was advertised with the claim that he "ventured to depart from the common mode by rejecting the long '≈ø' in favor of the round one, as being less liable to error....."&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Morison, ''A Memoir of John Bell, 1745‚Äì1831'' (1930, Cambridge Univ. Press) page 105; Daniel Berkeley Updike, ''Printing Types, Their History, Forms, and Use ‚Äì a study in survivals'' (2nd. ed, 1951, [[Harvard University Press]]) page 293.&lt;/ref&gt;   ''[[The Times]]'' of London made the switch from the long to the short ''s'' with its issue of 10 September 1803. 
[[History of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica|''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica'']]'s 5th edition, completed in 1817, was the last edition to use the long ''s''.

In [[German orthography]], long ''s'' was retained in [[Fraktur]] ([[Schwabacher]]) type as well as in standard cursive ([[S√ºtterlin]]) well into the 20th century, and was officially abolished in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;
[[:File:Schrifterlass Antiqua1941.gif|Order]] of 3 January  1941 to all public offices, signed by [[Martin Bormann]].
{{cite book |first=Albert |last=Kapr |title=Fraktur: Form und Geschichte der gebrochenen Schriften |location=Mainz |publisher=H. Schmidt |year=1993 |page=81 |isbn=3-87439-260-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] of ''≈øs'' (or ''≈øz'') was retained, however, giving rise to the ''[[Eszett]]'', ''[[√ü]]'' in contemporary German orthography.

==Use in writing systems==

The letter {{angbr|s}} is the seventh most common letter in [[English language|English]] and the third-most common consonant after {{angbr|t}} and {{angbr|n}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2003-2004/cryptography/subs/frequencies.html English Letter Frequency]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most common letter in starting and ending position.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In English and several other languages, primarily [[Western Romance languages|Western Romance]] ones like [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]], final {{angbr|s}} is the usual mark of [[plural]] [[noun]]s. It is the regular ending of English [[grammatical person|third person]] [[present tense]] [[verb]]s.

{{angbr|s}} represents the [[voiceless alveolar sibilant|voiceless alveolar]] or [[voiceless dental sibilant]] {{IPA|/s/}} in most languages as well as in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]. It also commonly represents the [[voiced alveolar sibilant|voiced alveolar]] or [[voiced dental sibilant]] {{IPA|/z/}}, as in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''mesa'' (table) or English 'rose' and 'bands', or it may represent the [[voiceless palato-alveolar fricative]] {{IPA|[ É]}}, as in most [[Portuguese dialects]] when syllable-finally, in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], in [[German language|German]] (before {{angbr|p}}, {{angbr|t}}) and some English words as 'sugar', since [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Yod-coalescence|yod-coalescence]] became a dominant feature, and {{IPA|[ í]}}, as in English 'measure' (also because of yod-coalescence), [[European Portuguese]] ''Isl√£o'' ([[Islam]]) or, in many sociolects of [[Brazilian Portuguese]], ''esdr√∫xulo'' ([[proparoxytone]]) in some [[Andalusian Spanish|Andalusian dialects]], it merged with [[Peninsular Spanish]] {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|z}} and is now pronounced {{IPA|[Œ∏]}}.  In some English words of French origin, the letter {{angbr|s}} is silent, as in 'isle' or 'debris'.

The [[Sh (digraph)|{{angbr|sh}} digraph]] for English  {{IPA|/ É/}} arises in Middle English (alongside [[Sch (trigraph)|{{angbr|sch}}]]), replacing the Old English {{angbr|sc}} digraph. Similarly, Old High German {{angbr|sc}} was replaced by {{angbr|sch}} in Early Modern High German orthography.

''[[Taw]]'' was the last letter of the Western [[Semitic alphabets|Semitic]] and [[Hebrew alphabet]]s.  The sound value of Semitic ''Taw'', [[Greek alphabet]] TŒ±œÖ (''Tau''), [[Old Italic alphabet|Old Italic]] and Latin T has remained fairly constant, representing {{IPAblink|t}} in each of these; and it has also kept its original basic shape in most of these alphabets.

==Use in writing systems==

===English===
In English, {{angbr|t}} usually denotes the [[voiceless alveolar plosive]] ([[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]] and [[X-SAMPA]]: {{IPAslink|t}}), as in ''tart'', ''tee'', or ''ties'', often with [[Aspirated consonant|aspiration]] at the beginnings of words or before [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] vowels.

The digraph {{angbr|ti}} often corresponds to the sound {{IPA|/ É/}} (a [[voiceless palato-alveolar sibilant]]) word-medially when followed by a vowel, as in ''nation'', ''ratio'', ''negotiation,'' and ''Croatia''.

The letter {{angbr|t}} corresponds to the affricate {{IPA|/tÕ° É/}} in some words as a result of [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Yod-coalescence|yod-coalescence]] (for example, in words ending in "-ture", such as ''future'').

A common [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] is {{angbr|th}}, which usually represents a [[dental fricative]], but occasionally represents {{IPA|/t/}} (as in ''Thomas'' and ''thyme''.)

===Other languages===
In the [[orthographies]] of other languages, {{angbr|t}} is often used for {{IPA|/t/}}, the [[voiceless dental plosive]] {{IPA|/tÃ™/}} or similar sounds.

===Other systems===
In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], {{angbr|{{IPA|t}}}} denotes the [[voiceless alveolar plosive]].
