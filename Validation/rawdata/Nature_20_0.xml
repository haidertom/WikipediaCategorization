'''A''' ([[English alphabet#Letter names|named]] {{IPAc-en|'|e…™}}, plural ''As'', ''A's'', ''a''s, ''a's'' or ''aes''{{refn|group=nb|''Aes'' is the plural of the name of the letter. The plural of the letter itself is rendered ''A''s, A's, ''a''s, or a's.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|Weiner|1989|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}) is the first [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] and the first [[vowel]] of the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]].&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; It is similar to the [[Greek_alphabet#History|Ancient Greek letter]] [[alpha]], from which it derives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCarter|1974|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. The lowercase version can be written in two forms: the double-storey '''a''' and single-storey '''…ë'''. The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in [[italic type]].

The earliest certain ancestor of "A" is [[aleph]] (also written 'aleph), the first letter of the [[Phoenician alphabet]],&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consisted entirely of [[consonant]]s (for that reason, it is also called an [[abjad]] to distinguish it from a true [[alphabet]]). In turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a [[pictogram]] of an ox head in [[proto-Sinaitic script]]&lt;ref name=Coll&gt;{{harvnb|Hall-Quest|1997|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; influenced by [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.

By 1600 BC, the Phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. Its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] or [[Arabic script|Arabic]] aleph.

When the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter to represent the [[glottal stop]]‚Äîthe consonant sound that the letter denoted in [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] and other [[Semitic languages]], and that was the first [[phoneme]] of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter‚Äîso they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel {{IPA|/a/}}, and called it by the similar name of [[alpha]]. In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the [[Greek Dark Ages]], dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the [[Greek alphabet]] of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.

The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the [[Old Italic script|Etruscan alphabet]] to write the [[Latin|Latin language]], and the resulting letter was preserved in the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] that would come to be used to write many languages, including English.

===Typographic variants===
[[File:A-small glyphs.svg|thumb|140px|Different [[glyphs]] of the lowercase letter A.]]
During Roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter "A". First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other "permanent" media. There was also a [[cursive]] style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces. Due to the "perishable" nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as [[letter case|majuscule]] cursive, [[letter case|minuscule]] cursive, and semicursive minuscule. Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. The known variants include the early [[Uncial script#Half-uncial|semi-uncial]], the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.&lt;ref name=Americana&gt;{{harvnb|Diringer|2000|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LowercaseA.svg|left|thumb|200px|[[Allography|Typographic variants]] include a double-storey '''a''' and single-storey '''…ë'''.]]At the end of the [[Roman Empire]] (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe. Among these were the semicursive minuscule of [[Italy]], the [[Merovingian script]] in France, the [[Visigothic script]] in Spain, and the [[Insular script|Insular]] or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule of Great Britain. By the 9th century, the [[Carolingian minuscule|Caroline script]], which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.&lt;ref name=Americana/&gt;

15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today. These variants, the ''Italic'' and ''Roman'' forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italic form, also called ''script a,'' is used in most current [[handwriting]] and consists of a circle and vertical stroke. This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter [[tau]] in the hands of medieval Irish and English writers.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; The Roman form is used in most printed material; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it ("a").&lt;ref name=Americana/&gt; Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.

[[Italic type]] is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest (set in Roman type). There are some other cases aside from italic type where ''script a'' ("…ë"), also called [[Latin alpha]], is used in contrast with Latin "a" (such as in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]).

==Use in writing systems==
[[File:Pronunciation_of_the_name_of_the_letter_‚ü®a‚ü©_in_European_languages.png|thumb|Pronunciation of the name of the letter {{angbr|a}} in European languages, note that /a/ and /aÀê/ can differ phonetically between {{IPAblink|a}}, {{IPAblink|√§}}, {{IPAblink|√¶}} and {{IPAblink|…ë}} depending on the language.|305x305px]]
===English===
{{further information|Pronunciation of English ‚ü®a‚ü©}}
In modern [[English orthography]], the letter {{angbr|a}} represents at least seven different vowel sounds:
*the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/√¶/}} as in ''pad'';
*the [[open back unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/…ëÀê/}} as in ''father'', which is closer to its original Latin and Greek sound;&lt;ref name=Coll/&gt;
*the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/e…™/}} as in ''ace'' and ''major'' (usually when {{vr|a}} is followed by one, or occasionally two, consonants and then another vowel letter) ‚Äì this results from [[Middle English lengthening]] followed by the [[Great Vowel Shift]];
*the modified form of the above sound that occurs [[English-language vowel changes before historic /r/|before {{vr|r}}]], as in ''square'' and ''Mary'';
*the rounded vowel of ''water'';
*the shorter rounded vowel (not present in [[General American]]) in ''was'' and ''what'';&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;
*a [[schwa]], in many unstressed syllables, as in ''about'', ''comma'', ''solar''.

The double {{angbr|aa}} sequence does not occur in native English words, but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as ''Aaron'' and ''[[aardvark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gelb|Whiting|1998|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, {{vr|a}} occurs in [[List of Latin-script digraphs|many common digraphs]], all with their own sound or sounds, particularly {{vr|ai}}, {{vr|au}}, {{vr|aw}}, {{vr|ay}}, {{vr|ea}} and {{vr|oa}}.

{{angbr|a}} is the third-most-commonly used letter in English (after {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|t}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second most common in Spanish and French. In one study, on average, about 3.68% of letters used in English texts tend to be {{angbr|a}}, while the number is 6.22% in Spanish and 3.95% in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other languages===
In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, {{angbr|a}} denotes an open unrounded vowel, such as {{IPA|/[[Open front unrounded vowel|a]]/}}, {{IPA|/[[Open central unrounded vowel|√§]]/}}, or {{IPA|/[[Open back unrounded vowel|…ë]]/}}. An exception is [[Saanich dialect|Saanich]], in which {{angbr|a}} (and the glyph [[√Å]]) stands for a [[close-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/e/}}.

===Other systems===

In phonetic and phonemic notation:
*in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], {{angbr|{{IPA|a}}}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]], {{angbr|{{IPA|√§}}}} is used for the [[open central unrounded vowel]], and {{angbr|{{IPA|…ë}}}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].
*in [[X-SAMPA]], {{angbr|a}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]] and {{angbr|A}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].

==Other uses==
{{main article|A (disambiguation)}}
In [[algebra]], the letter ''a'' along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities, whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') are used to denote unknown quantities.

In [[geometry]], capital A, B, C etc. are used to denote [[Line segment|segment]]s, [[line (geometry)|line]]s, [[Line (geometry)#Ray|rays]], etc.&lt;ref name=Americana/&gt; A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a [[triangle]], the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A.&lt;ref name=Coll/&gt;

"A" is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; "A grade" for clean restaurants; [[A-list]] celebrities, etc. Such associations can have a [[motivation|motivating]] effect, as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ciani &amp; Sheldon|2010|pp=99‚Äì100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"A" is used as a prefix on some words, such as [[asymmetry]], to mean "not" or "without" (from Greek).

Finally, the letter A is used to denote size, as in a narrow size shoe,&lt;ref name=Coll/&gt; or a small cup size in a [[brassiere]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

'''C''' is the third [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] in the [[English alphabet]] and a letter of the [[alphabet]]s of many other [[writing system]]s which inherited it from the [[Latin alphabet]]. It is also the third letter of the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]]. It is [[English alphabet#Letter names|named]] ''cee'' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|s|iÀê}}) in [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;"C" ''Oxford English Dictionary,'' 2nd edition (1989); ''Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged'' (1993); "cee", ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

"C" comes from the same letter as "G". The [[Semitic people|Semites]] named it [[gimel]]. The sign is possibly adapted from an [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Egyptian hieroglyph]] for a [[Staff-sling|staff sling]], which may have been the meaning of the name ''gimel''. Another possibility is that it depicted a camel, the Semitic name for which was ''gamal''. [[Barry B. Powell]], a specialist in the history of writing, states "It is hard to imagine how gimel = "camel" can be derived from the picture of a camel (it may show his hump, or his head and neck!)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Powell|first=Barry B.|title=Writing: Theory and History of the Technology of Civilization|date=27 Mar 2009|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|isbn=978-1405162562|page=182|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PZ2Gr3d9X2UC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=Gimel+shaped+like+a+camel%27s+neck#v=onepage&amp;q=Gimel%20shaped%20like%20a%20camel's%20neck&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Etruscan language]], [[plosive consonant]]s had no contrastive [[phonation|voicing]], so the [[Greek language|Greek]] '[[Gamma|Œì]]' (Gamma) was adopted into the [[Old Italic script#Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan alphabet]] to represent {{IPA|/k/}}. Already in the [[Western Greek alphabet]], Gamma first took a '[[File:Early Etruscan C.gif|15px]]' form in Early Etruscan, then '[[File:Classical Etruscan C.gif|15px]]' in Classical Etruscan. In Latin it eventually took the '{{smallcaps|c}}' form in Classical Latin. In the earliest [[Latin]] inscriptions, the letters '{{smallcaps|c k q}}' were used to represent the sounds {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/…°/}} (which were not differentiated in writing).  Of these, '{{smallcaps|q}}' was used to represent {{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/…°/}} before a rounded vowel, '{{smallcaps|k}}' before '{{smallcaps|a}}', and '{{smallcaps|c}}' elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 3rd century BC, a modified character was introduced for {{IPA|/…°/}}, and '{{smallcaps|c}}' itself was retained for {{IPA|/k/}}. The use of '{{smallcaps|c}}' (and its variant '{{smallcaps|g}}') replaced most usages of '{{smallcaps|k}}' and '{{smallcaps|q}}'.  Hence, in the classical period and after, '{{smallcaps|g}}' was treated as the equivalent of Greek gamma, and '{{smallcaps|c}}' as the equivalent of kappa; this shows in the romanization of Greek words, as in 'ŒöŒëŒîŒúŒüŒ£', 'ŒöŒ•Œ°ŒüŒ£', and 'Œ¶Œ©ŒöŒôŒ£' came into Latin as '{{smallcaps|cadmvs}}', '{{smallcaps|cyrvs}}' and '{{smallcaps|phocis}}', respectively.

Other alphabets have letters [[homoglyph]]ic to 'c' but not analogous in use and derivation, like the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] letter [[Es (Cyrillic)|Es]] (–°, —Å) which derives from the lunate [[sigma (letter)|sigma]], named due to its resemblance to the crescent moon.

==Later use==
{{unreferenced|date=September 2018|section}}
When the Roman alphabet was introduced into Britain, {{angbr|c}} represented only {{IPA|/k/}}, and this value of the letter has been retained in loanwords to all the [[insular Celtic languages]]: in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]], {{angbr|c}} represents only {{IPA|/k/}}. The [[Old English Latin alphabet|Old English Latin-based writing system]] was learned from the Celts, apparently of Ireland; hence {{angbr|c}} in Old English also originally represented {{IPA|/k/}}; the Modern English words ''kin, break, broken, thick'', and ''seek,'' all come from Old English words written with {{angbr|c}}: ''cyn, brecan, brocen, √æicc'', and ''s√©oc''. But during the course of the Old English period, {{IPA|/k/}} before front vowels ({{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}}) were [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]], having changed by the tenth century to {{IPA|[t É]}}, though {{angbr|c}} was still used, as in ''cir(i)ce, wrecc(e)a''. On the continent, meanwhile, a similar phonetic change had also been going on (for example, in [[Italian language|Italian]]).

In Vulgar Latin, {{IPA|/k/}} became palatalized to {{IPA|[t É]}} in Italy and Dalmatia; in France and the Iberian peninsula, it became {{IPA|[ts]}}. Yet for these new sounds {{angbr|{{sm|c}}}} was still used before the letters {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|i}}.  The letter thus represented two distinct values. Subsequently, the Latin phoneme {{IPA|/k ∑/}} (spelled {{angbr|{{smallcaps|qv}}}}) de-labialized to {{IPA|/k/}} meaning that the various Romance languages had {{IPA|/k/}} before front vowels.  In addition, [[Norman language|Norman]] used the letter {{angbr|k}} so that the sound {{IPA|/k/}} could be represented by either {{angbr|k}} or {{angbr|c}}, the latter of which could represent either {{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/ts/}} depending on whether it preceded a front vowel letter or not. The convention of using both {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|k}} was applied to the writing of English after the [[Norman Conquest]], causing a considerable re-spelling of the Old English words. Thus while Old English ''candel, clif, corn, crop, c√∫,'' remained unchanged, ''Cent, c√¶¬¥·µπ (c√©¬¥·µπ), cyng, brece, s√©oce,'' were now (without any change of sound) spelled 'Kent', 'ke»ù', 'kyng', 'breke', and 'seoke'; even ''cniht'' ('knight') was subsequently changed to 'kniht' and ''√æic'' ('thick') changed to 'thik' or 'thikk'. The Old English 'cw' was also at length displaced by the French 'qu' so that the Old English ''cw√©n'' ('queen') and ''cwic'' ('quick') became [[Middle English]] 'quen' 'quik', respectively. The sound {{IPA|[t É]}}, to which Old English palatalized {{IPA|/k/}} had advanced, also occurred in French, chiefly from Latin {{IPA|/k/}} before 'a'. In French it was represented by the digraph {{angbr|ch}}, as in ''champ'' (from Latin ''camp-um'') and this spelling was introduced into English: the Hatton Gospels, written about 1160, have in Matt. i-iii, ''child, chyld, riche, mychel,'' for the ''cild, rice, mycel,'' of the Old English version whence they were copied. In these cases, the Old English {{angbr|c}} gave place to {{angbr|k qu ch}} but, on the other hand, {{angbr|c}} in its new value of {{IPA|/ts/}} came in largely in French words like ''processiun, emperice, grace,'' and was also substituted for 'ts' in a few Old English words, as ''miltse, bletsien,'' in early Middle English ''milce, blecien''. By the end of the thirteenth century both in France and England, this sound {{IPA|/ts/}} de-affricated to {{IPA|/s/}}; and from that time {{angbr|c}} has represented {{IPA|/s/}} before front vowels either for [[etymology|etymological]] reasons, as in ''lance, cent,'' or to avoid the ambiguity due to the "etymological" use of {{angbr|s}} for {{IPA|/z/}}, as in ''ace, mice, once, pence, defence''.

Thus, to show etymology, English spelling has ''advise'', ''devise'' (instead of ''advize'', ''devize''), while ''advice, device, dice, ice, mice, twice,'' etc., do not reflect etymology; example has extended this to ''hence, pence, defence,'' etc., where there is no etymological reason for using {{angbr|c}}. Former generations also wrote ''{{lang|en|sence}}'' for ''sense''. Hence, today the [[Romance languages]] and [[English language|English]] have a common feature inherited from [[Vulgar Latin]] spelling conventions where {{angbr|c}} takes on either a [[Hard and soft C|"hard" or "soft"]] value depending on the following letter.

==Use in writing systems==
{{unreferenced|date=September 2018|section}}
===English===
In [[English orthography]], {{angbr|c}} generally represents the "soft" value of {{IPAc-en|s}} before the letters {{angbr|e}} (including the Latin-derived digraphs {{angbr|ae}} and {{angbr|oe}}, or the corresponding ligatures {{angbr|√¶}} and {{angbr|≈ì}}), {{angbr|i}}, and {{angbr|y}}, and a "hard" value of {{IPAc-en|k}} before any other letters or at the end of a word. However, there are a number of exceptions in English: "[[soccer]]" and "[[Pronunciation of Celtic|Celt]]" are words that have {{IPAc-en|k}} where {{IPAc-en|s}} would be expected.

The "soft" {{angbr|c}} may represent the {{IPAc-en| É}} sound in the digraph {{angbr|ci}} when this precedes a vowel, as in the words 'delicious' and 'appreciate', and also in the word "ocean" and its derivatives.

The digraph {{angbr|[[Ch (digraph)|ch]]}} most commonly represents {{IPAc-en|t É}}, but can also represent {{IPAc-en|k}} (mainly in words of [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] origin) or {{IPAc-en| É}} (mainly in words of [[French language|French]] origin). For some dialects of English, it may also represent {{IPAc-en|x}} in words like ''loch'', while other speakers pronounce the final sound as {{IPAc-en|k}}. The trigraph {{angbr|tch}} always represents {{IPAc-en|t É}}.

The digraph {{angbr|ck}} is often used to represent the sound {{IPAc-en|k}}  after short vowels.

===Other languages===
In the Romance languages [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], {{angbr|c}} generally has a "hard" value of {{IPA|/k/}} and a "soft" value whose pronunciation varies by language. In French, Portuguese, Catalan and Spanish from Latin America and southern Spain, the soft {{angbr|c}} value is {{IPA|/s/}} as it is in English.  In the Spanish spoken in northern and central Spain, the soft {{angbr|c}} is a [[voiceless dental fricative]] {{IPA|/Œ∏/}}. In [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]], the soft {{angbr|c}} is {{IPA|[tÕ° É]}}.

All [[Balto-Slavic languages]] that use the Latin alphabet, as well as [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], several [[Sami languages]], [[Esperanto language|Esperanto]], [[Ido language|Ido]], [[Interlingua language|Interlingua]], and [[Americanist phonetic notation]] (and those [[Indigenous languages of North America|aboriginal languages of North America]] whose practical orthography derives from it) use {{angbr|c}} to represent {{IPA|/tÕ°s/}}, the [[voiceless alveolar sibilant affricate|voiceless alveolar]] or [[voiceless dental sibilant affricate]]. In [[Pinyin|romanized]] [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], the letter represents an aspirated version of this sound, {{IPA|/tÕ°s ∞/}}.

Among non-European languages that have adopted the Latin alphabet, {{angbr|c}} represents a variety of sounds. [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik language|Yup'ik]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Malay language|Malay]], and a number of African languages such as [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Fula language|Fula]], and [[Manding languages|Manding]] share the soft Italian value of {{IPA|/tÕ° É/}}.  In [[Azeri language|Azeri]], [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]], [[Northern Kurdish|Kurmanji Kurdish]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] {{angbr|c}} stands for the voiced counterpart of this sound, the [[voiced postalveolar affricate]] {{IPA|/dÕ° í/}}. In [[Yabem language|Yabem]] and similar languages, such as [[Bukawa language|Bukawa]], {{angbr|c}} stands for a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/ î/}}. [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]] use this letter to represent the click {{IPA|/«Ä/}}. In some other African languages, such as Beninese [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], {{angbr|c}} is used for {{IPA|/ É/}}. In [[Fijian language|Fijian]], {{angbr|c}} stands for a [[voiced dental fricative]] {{IPA|/√∞/}}, while in [[Somali language|Somali]] it has the value of {{IPA|/[[Voiced pharyngeal fricative| ï]]/}}.

The letter {{angbr|c}} is also used as a transliteration of Cyrillic {{angbr|—Ü}} in the Latin forms of [[Serbian alphabet|Serbian]], [[Romanisation of Macedonian|Macedonian]], and sometimes [[Romanization of Ukrainian|Ukrainian]], along with the digraph {{angbr|ts}}.

===Other systems===
As a [[phonetic]] symbol, lowercase {{angbr|{{IPA|c}}}} is the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) and [[X-SAMPA]] symbol for the [[voiceless palatal plosive]], and capital {{angbr|C}} is the X-SAMPA symbol for the [[voiceless palatal fricative]].

===Digraphs===
There are several common digraphs with {{angbr|c}}, the most common being {{angbr|[[Ch (digraph)|ch]]}}, which in some languages (such as [[German language|German]]) is far more common than {{angbr|c}} alone. {{angbr|ch}} takes various values in other languages.

As in English, {{angbr|ck}}, with the value {{IPA|/k/}}, is often used after short vowels in other [[Germanic languages]] such as German and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (but some other Germanic languages use {{angbr|kk}} instead, such as Dutch and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]). The digraph {{angbr|cz}} is found in Polish and {{angbr|cs}} in Hungarian, both representing {{IPA|/tÕ° É/}}. The digraph {{angbr|sc}} represents {{IPA|/ É/}} in Old English, Italian, and a few languages related to Italian (where this only happens before [[front vowel]]s, while otherwise it represents {{IPA|/sk/}}). The trigraph {{angbr|sch}} represents {{IPA|/ É/}} in German.

The Latin letter 'E' differs little from its source, the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letter [[epsilon]], 'Œï'. This in turn comes from the [[Semitic alphabet|Semitic]] letter ''[[He (letter)|h√™]]'', which has been suggested to have started as a praying or calling human figure (''[[hillul]]'' 'jubilation'), and was probably based on a similar [[Egyptian hieroglyph]] that indicated a different pronunciation. In Semitic, the letter represented {{IPA|/h/}} (and {{IPA|/e/}} in foreign words); in Greek, ''h√™'' became the letter epsilon, used to represent {{IPA|/e/}}.  The various forms of the [[Old Italic script]] and the [[Latin alphabet]] followed this usage.

==Use in writing systems==
[[File:Pronunciation_of_the_name_of_the_letter_‚ü®e‚ü©_in_European_languages.png|thumb|Pronunciation of the name of the letter {{angbr|e}} in European languages|305x305px]]

===English===
Although [[Middle English]] spelling used {{angbr|e}} to represent long and short {{IPAslink|e}}, the [[Great Vowel Shift]] changed long /eÀê/ (as in 'me' or 'bee') to /iÀê/ while short {{IPAslink|…õ}} (as in 'met' or 'bed') remained a [[mid vowel]]. In other cases, the letter is [[Silent e|silent]], generally at the end of words.

===Other languages===
In the orthography of many languages it represents either {{IPAblink|e}}, {{IPAblink|eÃû}},  {{IPAblink|…õ}}, or some variation (such as a [[Nasal vowel|nasalized]] version) of these sounds, often with diacritics (as: {{angle bracket|e [[√™]] [[√©]] [[√®]] [[√´]] [[ƒì]] [[ƒï]] [[ƒõ]] [[·∫Ω]] [[ƒó]] [[·∫π]] [[ƒô]] [[·∫ª]]}}) to indicate contrasts.  Less commonly, as in French, German, or Saanich, {{angbr|e}} represents a [[mid-central vowel]] /…ô/. [[Digraph (orthography)|Digraphs]] with {{angbr|e}} are common to indicate either [[diphthong]]s or [[monophthong]]s, such as {{angbr|ea}} or {{angbr|ee}} for {{IPA|/iÀê/}} or {{IPA|/e…™/}} in English, {{angbr|ei}} for {{IPA|/a…™/}} in [[German language|German]], and {{angbr|eu}} for {{IPA|/√∏/}} in [[French language|French]] or {{IPA|/…î…™/}} in German.

===Other systems===
The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] uses {{angbr|{{IPA|e}}}} for the [[close-mid front unrounded vowel]] or the [[mid front unrounded vowel]].

==Most common letter==
'E' is the most common (or highest-[[Frequency (statistics)|frequency]]) letter in the English alphabet (starting off the typographer's phrase [[ETAOIN SHRDLU]]) and several other European [[languages]], which has implications in both [[cryptography]] and [[data compression]]. In the story "[[The Gold-Bug]]" by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], a character figures out a random character code by remembering that the most used letter in English is E. This makes it a hard and popular letter to use when writing [[lipogram]]s. [[Ernest Vincent Wright]]'s ''[[Gadsby (novel)|Gadsby]]'' (1939) is considered a "dreadful" novel, and supposedly "at least part of Wright's narrative issues were caused by language limitations imposed by the lack of ''E''."&lt;ref&gt;Ross Eckler, ''Making the Alphabet Dance: Recreational Word Play''. New York: St. Martin's Press (1996): 3&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Georges Perec]]'s novel ''[[A Void (novel)|A Void]]'' (''La Disparition'') (1969) and its English translation by Gilbert Adair omit 'e' and are considered better works.&lt;ref&gt;Eckler (1996): 3. Perec's novel "was so well written that at least some reviewers never realized the existence of a letter constraint."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in writing systems==
In [[English orthography]] and most other European languages, {{angbr|p}} represents the sound {{IPAc-en|p}}.

A common [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] in English is {{angbr|ph}}, which represents the sound {{IPAc-en|f}}, and can be used to transliterate {{angbr|œÜ}} ''[[phi]]'' in loanwords from [[Greek language|Greek]]. In German, the digraph {{angbr|pf}} is common, representing a labial [[affricate]] {{IPA|/pf/}}.

Most English words beginning with {{angbr|p}} are of foreign origin, primarily French, Latin, Greek, and Slavic;{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} these languages preserve [[Proto-Indo-European phonology#Consonants|Proto-Indo-European]] initial *p.  Native English cognates of such words often start with {{angbr|f}}, since English is a [[Germanic language]] and thus has undergone [[Grimm's law]]; a native English word with initial {{IPA|/p/}} would reflect Proto-Indo-European initial *b, which is so rare that its existence as a [[phoneme]] is disputed.

However, native English words with non-initial {{angbr|p}} are quite common; such words can come from either [[Kluge's law]] or the consonant cluster {{IPA|/sp/}} (PIE *p has been preserved after s).

In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], {{IPA|/p/}} is used to represent the [[voiceless bilabial plosive]].

'''S''' ([[English alphabet#Letter names|named]] ''ess'' {{IPAc-en|…õ|s}},&lt;ref&gt;Spelled 'es'- in compound words&lt;/ref&gt; plural ''esses''&lt;ref&gt;"S", ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]],'' 2nd edition (1989); ''Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged'' (1993); "ess," op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;) is the 19th [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] in the [[English alphabet|Modern English alphabet]] and the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]].

==History==
===Origin===
{{see|Shin (letter)|Sigma|San (letter)|Sho (letter)}}

[[Northwest Semitic abjad|Northwest Semitic]] [[Shin (letter)|≈°√Æn]]  represented a [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|/ É/}} (as in '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''sh''ip'). It originated most likely as a pictogram of a tooth ({{lang|sem|[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Semitic/≈°inn-|◊©◊†◊ê]]}}) and represented the phoneme {{IPA|/ É/}} via the acrophonic principle.&lt;ref&gt;"corresponds etymologically (in part, at least) to original Semitic ''·πØ'' (th), which was pronounced ''s'' in South Canaanite"  Albright, W. F., "The Early Alphabetic Inscriptions from Sinai and their Decipherment," Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 110 (1948), p. 15. The interpretation as "tooth" is now prevalent, but not entirely certain. The ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' of 1972 reported that the letter represented a "composite bow".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Greek|Greek]] did not have a  {{IPA|/ É/}} phoneme, so the derived Greek letter [[Sigma (letter)|Sigma]] (Œ£) came to represent the [[voiceless alveolar sibilant]] {{IPA|/s/}}. 
While the letter shape Œ£ continues Phoenician ''≈°√Æn'', its name ''sigma'' is taken from the letter ''[[samekh]]'', while the shape of ''samekh'' but name and position of ''≈°√Æn'' is continued in the ''[[Œû|xi]]''. {{fact|date=June 2017}}
Within Greek, the name of ''sigma'' was influenced by its association with the Greek word œÉŒØŒ∂œâ (earlier ''*sigj-'') "to hiss". The original name of the letter "sigma" may have been ''san'', but due to the complicated early history of the Greek epichoric alphabets, "san" came to be identified as a separate letter, [[San (letter)|œ∫]].&lt;ref&gt;Woodard, Roger D. (2006). "Alphabet". In Wilson, Nigel Guy. Encyclopedia of ancient Greece. London: Routldedge. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] reports that "San" was the name given by the  [[Doric Greek|Dorians]] to the same letter called "Sigma" by the [[Ionic Greek|Ionians]].&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|grc|‚Ä¶œÑ·Ω†œÖœÑ·Ω∏ Œ≥œÅŒ¨ŒºŒºŒ±, œÑ·Ω∏ ŒîœâœÅŒπŒ≠ŒµœÇ Œº·Ω≤ŒΩ œÉ·Ω∞ŒΩ Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒ≠ŒøœÖœÉŒπ ,·ººœâŒΩŒµœÇ Œ¥·Ω≤ œÉŒØŒ≥ŒºŒ±}}" ('‚Ä¶the same letter, which the Dorians call "San", but the Ionians "Sigma"‚Ä¶'; Herodotus, ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 1.139); cf. Nick Nicholas, [http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/nonattic.html ''Non-Attic letters''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120628161421/http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/nonattic.html |date=2012-06-28 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Western Greek alphabet]] used in [[Cumae]] was adopted by the [[Etruscans]] and [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]] in the 7th century BC, over the following centuries developing into a range of [[Old Italic alphabets]] including the [[Etruscan alphabet]] and the early [[Latin alphabet]].
In [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], the value {{IPA|/s/}} of Greek sigma (êåî) was maintained, while san (êåë)
represented a separate phoneme, most likely {{IPA|/ É/}} (transliterated as ''≈õ''). 
The early Latin alphabet adopted sigma, but not san, as Old Latin did not have a  {{IPA|/ É/}} phoneme.

The shape of Latin S arises from Greek Œ£ by dropping one out of the four strokes of that letter.
The (angular) S-shape composed of three strokes existed as a variant of the four-stroke letter Œ£ already in the epigraphy in [[Archaic Greek alphabets|Western Greek alphabets]], and the three and four strokes variants existed alongside one another in the classical Etruscan alphabet. In other [[Old Italic script|Italic alphabets]] (Venetic, Lepontic), the letter could be represented as a zig-zagging line of any number between three and six strokes.

The Italic letter was also adopted into [[Elder Futhark]], as ''[[Sowil≈ç]]'' ({{script|Runr|·õä}}), and appears with four to eight strokes in the earliest runic inscriptions, but is occasionally reduced to three strokes ({{script|Runr|·õã}}) from the later 5th century, and appears regularly with three strokes in [[Younger Futhark]].

===Long s===
[[File:Schw√§bische Bastarda 1496 Schriftprobe Priesters Tochter.png|thumb|Late medieval German script (Swabian [[bastarda]], dated 1496) illustrating the use of long and round ''s'': ''prie≈øters tochter'' ("priest's daughter").]]
{{main|long s}}

The [[lower case|minuscule form]]  ≈ø, called the [[long s|long ''s'']], developed in the early medieval period, within the [[Visigothic script|Visigothic]] and [[Carolingian minuscule|Carolingian]] hands, with predecessors in the [[half-uncial]] and [[Roman cursive|cursive]] scripts of [[Late Antiquity]]. It remained standard in western writing throughout the medieval period and was adopted in early printing with movable types. 
It existed alongside minuscule "round" or "short" ''s'', which was at the time only used at the end of words.

In most western orthographies, the ≈ø gradually fell out of use during the second half of the 18th century, although it remained in occasional use into the 19th century.
In Spain, the change was mainly accomplished between the years 1760 and 1766. In France, the change occurred between 1782 and 1793. Printers in the United States stopped using the long ''s'' between 1795 and 1810. In English orthography, the London printer [[John Bell (publisher)|John Bell]] (1745‚Äì1831) pioneered the change. His edition of Shakespeare, in 1785, was advertised with the claim that he "ventured to depart from the common mode by rejecting the long '≈ø' in favor of the round one, as being less liable to error....."&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Morison, ''A Memoir of John Bell, 1745‚Äì1831'' (1930, Cambridge Univ. Press) page 105; Daniel Berkeley Updike, ''Printing Types, Their History, Forms, and Use ‚Äì a study in survivals'' (2nd. ed, 1951, [[Harvard University Press]]) page 293.&lt;/ref&gt;   ''[[The Times]]'' of London made the switch from the long to the short ''s'' with its issue of 10 September 1803. 
[[History of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica|''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica'']]'s 5th edition, completed in 1817, was the last edition to use the long ''s''.

In [[German orthography]], long ''s'' was retained in [[Fraktur]] ([[Schwabacher]]) type as well as in standard cursive ([[S√ºtterlin]]) well into the 20th century, and was officially abolished in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;
[[:File:Schrifterlass Antiqua1941.gif|Order]] of 3 January  1941 to all public offices, signed by [[Martin Bormann]].
{{cite book |first=Albert |last=Kapr |title=Fraktur: Form und Geschichte der gebrochenen Schriften |location=Mainz |publisher=H. Schmidt |year=1993 |page=81 |isbn=3-87439-260-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] of ''≈øs'' (or ''≈øz'') was retained, however, giving rise to the ''[[Eszett]]'', ''[[√ü]]'' in contemporary German orthography.

==Use in writing systems==

The letter {{angbr|s}} is the seventh most common letter in [[English language|English]] and the third-most common consonant after {{angbr|t}} and {{angbr|n}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2003-2004/cryptography/subs/frequencies.html English Letter Frequency]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most common letter in starting and ending position.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In English and several other languages, primarily [[Western Romance languages|Western Romance]] ones like [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]], final {{angbr|s}} is the usual mark of [[plural]] [[noun]]s. It is the regular ending of English [[grammatical person|third person]] [[present tense]] [[verb]]s.

{{angbr|s}} represents the [[voiceless alveolar sibilant|voiceless alveolar]] or [[voiceless dental sibilant]] {{IPA|/s/}} in most languages as well as in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]. It also commonly represents the [[voiced alveolar sibilant|voiced alveolar]] or [[voiced dental sibilant]] {{IPA|/z/}}, as in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''mesa'' (table) or English 'rose' and 'bands', or it may represent the [[voiceless palato-alveolar fricative]] {{IPA|[ É]}}, as in most [[Portuguese dialects]] when syllable-finally, in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], in [[German language|German]] (before {{angbr|p}}, {{angbr|t}}) and some English words as 'sugar', since [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Yod-coalescence|yod-coalescence]] became a dominant feature, and {{IPA|[ í]}}, as in English 'measure' (also because of yod-coalescence), [[European Portuguese]] ''Isl√£o'' ([[Islam]]) or, in many sociolects of [[Brazilian Portuguese]], ''esdr√∫xulo'' ([[proparoxytone]]) in some [[Andalusian Spanish|Andalusian dialects]], it merged with [[Peninsular Spanish]] {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|z}} and is now pronounced {{IPA|[Œ∏]}}.  In some English words of French origin, the letter {{angbr|s}} is silent, as in 'isle' or 'debris'.

The [[Sh (digraph)|{{angbr|sh}} digraph]] for English  {{IPA|/ É/}} arises in Middle English (alongside [[Sch (trigraph)|{{angbr|sch}}]]), replacing the Old English {{angbr|sc}} digraph. Similarly, Old High German {{angbr|sc}} was replaced by {{angbr|sch}} in Early Modern High German orthography.
