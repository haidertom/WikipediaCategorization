There are more than seventy [[List of cat breeds|cat breeds]] recognized by various [[Cat registry|cat registries]].

Cats are similar in [[Cat anatomy|anatomy]] to the other felids, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. [[Cat senses]] fit a [[crepuscular]] and [[predator]]y [[ecological niche]]. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in [[frequency]] for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer [[color vision]] and a better [[Olfaction|sense of smell]] than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a [[social animal|social species]], and [[cat communication]] includes the use of a variety of [[Animal communication|vocalizations]] ([[Cat communication|mewing]], [[purr]]ing, [[Trill consonant|trilling]], hissing, [[growling]] and [[Guttural|grunting]]) as well as [[cat pheromone]]s and types of [[Cat body language|cat-specific body language]].&lt;ref name="Moelk" /&gt;

==Nomenclature and etymology==
The origin of the English word ''[[wikt:cat#English|cat]]'' ([[Old English]] {{lang|ang|catt}}) and its counterparts in other [[Germanic languages]] (such as [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|Katze}}), descended from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*kattōn-'', is controversial.

Many references refer to "Berber" ([[Kabyle language|Kabyle]]) {{lang|kab|kaddîska}}, 'wildcat', and [[Nubian languages|Nubian]] {{lang|nub|kadīs}} as possible sources or cognates, but M.

A [[Pedigree (cat)|pedigreed cat]] is one whose ancestry is recorded by a [[Cat fancy|cat fancier]] organization. A [[Purebred cat|purebred (or pure-bred) cat]] is one whose ancestry contains only individuals of the same breed. Many pedigreed and especially purebred cats are exhibited as [[show cat]]s. Cats of unrecorded, mixed ancestry are referred to as [[Domestic short-haired cat|domestic short-haired]] or [[domestic long-haired cat]]s (by [[Coat (animal)|coat]] type), or commonly as random-bred, moggies (chiefly [[British English|British]]), or (using terms borrowed from [[dog breeding]]) mongrels or mutt-cats.

While the [[African wildcat]] is the ancestral [[subspecies]] from which domestic cats are descended, and wildcats and domestic cats can completely interbreed (being subspecies of the same species), several intermediate stages occur between domestic pet and pedigree cats on one hand and entirely wild animals on the other. The semi-[[Feral animal|feral]] cat, a mostly outdoor cat, is not owned by any one individual, but is generally friendly to people and may be fed by several households. Truly [[feral cat]]s are associated with human habitation areas, foraging for food and sometimes intermittently fed by people, but are typically wary of human interaction.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw1999" /&gt;

When it overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long [[Canine tooth|canine teeth]], inserting them between two of the prey's vertebrae and severing its [[spinal cord]], causing irreversible [[paralysis]] and death.&lt;ref name="Smith1992"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Structure, Function and Evolution of teeth |last1=Smith |first1=Patricia |last2=Tchernov |first2=Eitan |date=1992 |page=217 |publisher=[[Freund Publishing House]] |isbn=978-965-222-270-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae.&lt;ref name="Smith1992" /&gt; The [[premolar]] and first [[Molar (tooth)|molar]] together compose the [[carnassial]] pair on each side of the mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a pair of scissors. These are vital in feeding, since cats' small [[molar (tooth)|molars]] cannot chew food effectively, and cats are largely incapable of mastication.&lt;ref name="Case" /&gt;{{rp|37}} Although cats tend to have better teeth than most humans, with decay generally less likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel, a less damaging saliva, less retention of food particles between teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugar, they are nonetheless subject to occasional tooth loss and infection.&lt;ref name="Carr1978"&gt;{{Cite book |first=William H.

Cats, like dogs, are [[digitigrade]]s. They walk directly on their toes, with the bones of their feet making up the lower part of the visible leg.&lt;ref name="Lacquaniti 1999"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Motor Patterns in Walking |last1=Lacquaniti |first1=F. |last2=Grasso |first2=R. |last3=Zago |first3=M. |journal=News Physiol. Sci. |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=168–174 |date=1 August 1999 |pmid=11390844}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats are capable of walking very precisely because, like all [[Felinae|felines]], they directly register; that is, they place each hind paw (almost) directly in the print of the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks. This also provides sure footing for their hind paws when they navigate rough terrain. Unlike most mammals, when cats walk, they use a "pacing" [[gait]]; that is, they move the two legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. This trait is shared with [[camel]]s and [[giraffe]]s. As a walk speeds up into a trot, a cat's gait changes to be a "diagonal" gait, similar to that of most other mammals (and many other land animals, such as [[lizard]]s): the diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Christensen 2004"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Outwitting Cats |last=Christensen |first=Wendy |page=23 |publisher=[[Globe Pequot]] |date=2004 |isbn=978-1-59228-240-1 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=WmuQQXU6EtAC&amp;pg=PA23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like almost all members of the Felidae, cats have protractable and retractable [[claw]]s.&lt;ref name="Russell 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Claw Retraction and Protraction in the Carnivora: The Cheetah (Acinonyx Jubatus) as an Atypical Felid |last1=Russell |first1=Anthony P. |last2=Bryant |first2=Harold N. |journal=Journal of Zoology |date=2001 |volume=254 |issue=1 |pages=67–76 |doi=10.1017/S0952836901000565}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and [[fur]] around the [[paw]]'s toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the fore feet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet.&lt;ref name="Armes 1900"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Outline of Cat Lessons |last=Armes |first=Annetta F. |journal=The School Journal |date=22 December 1900 |volume=LXI |page=659 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=-_gBAAAAYAAJ |access-date=12 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, [[kneading (cats)|kneading]], or for extra traction on soft surfaces.

More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth "finger". This special feature of the front paws, on the inside of the wrists, is the carpal pad, also found on the paws of [[big cat]]s and dogs. It has no function in normal walking, but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping.

===Physiology===
Cats are familiar and easily kept animals, and their physiology has been particularly well studied; it generally resembles those of other carnivorous mammals, but displays several unusual features probably attributable to cats' descent from desert-dwelling species.&lt;ref name="MacDonald" /&gt; For instance, cats are able to tolerate quite high temperatures: Humans generally start to feel uncomfortable when their skin temperature passes about {{convert|38|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, but cats show no discomfort until their skin reaches around {{convert|52|°C|°F|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="Case" /&gt;{{rp|46}} and can tolerate temperatures of up to {{convert|56|°C|°F|abbr=on}} if they have access to water.&lt;ref name="SDCN"&gt;{{Cite book |author=US National Research Council Subcommittee on Dog and Cat Nutrition  |author-link=National Research Council (United States) |title=Nutrient Requirements of Dogs and Cats |publisher=[[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]] |location=Washington DC |date=2006 |page=292 |isbn=978-0-309-08628-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nutrition====

Cats are [[obligate carnivores]]: their [[physiology]] has evolved to efficiently process meat, and they have difficulty digesting plant matter.&lt;ref name="MacDonald"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Nutrition of the domestic cat, a mammalian carnivore |last1=MacDonald |first1=M.

Cats do eat [[grass]] occasionally. A proposed explanation is that cats use grass as a source of [[folic acid]]. Another is that it is used to supply [[dietary fiber]], helping the cat [[defecation|defecate]] more easily and expel parasites and other harmful material through feces and [[vomit]].&lt;ref name="EatGrass"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.animalplanet.com/pets/why-do-cats-eat-grass/ |title=Why Do Cats Eat Grass? |work=AnimalPlanet.com |date=2012-05-15|access-date=2 April 2017 |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170403194652/http://www.animalplanet.com/pets/why-do-cats-eat-grass/ |archive-date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cats are unusually dependent on a constant supply of the [[amino acid]] [[arginine]], and a diet lacking arginine causes marked weight loss and can be rapidly fatal.&lt;ref name="Morris 1978"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Arginine: An Essential Amino Acid for the Cat |last1=Morris |first1=J. G. |last2=Rogers |first2=Q. R. |journal=Journal of Nutrition |volume=108 |issue=12 |pages=1944–1953 |date=1 December 1978 |pmid=722344|doi=10.1093/jn/108.12.1944 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arginine]] is an essential additive in cat food because cats have low levels of the [[enzyme]]s [[aminotransferase]] and [[pyrroline-5-carboxylate]] which are responsible for the synthesis of ornithine and citrulline in the [[small intestine]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Bauer, J. (1998). Nutritional Uniqueness of Cats. ''Veterinary Quarterly,20''(Sup1), 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Citrulline]] would typically go on to the [[kidney]]s to make arginine, but because cats have a deficiency in the enzymes that make it, citrulline is not produced in adequate quantities to make arginine. Arginine is essential in the [[urea cycle]] in order to convert the toxic component [[ammonia]] into [[urea]] that can then be excreted in the urine.  Because of its essential role, deficiency in arginine results in a buildup of toxic ammonia and leads to hyperammonemia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The symptoms of [[hyperammonemia]] include [[lethargy]], vomiting, [[ataxia]], [[hyperesthesia]] and can be serious enough to induce death and [[coma]] in a matter of days if a cat is being fed an arginine-free diet. The quick onset of these symptoms is due to the fact that diets devoid in arginine will typically still contain all of the other [[amino acid]]s, which will continue to be [[Catabolism|catabolized]] by the body, producing mass amounts of ammonia that very quickly build up with no way of being excreted.

Another unusual feature is that the cat cannot produce [[taurine]],{{refn|group=note|name=AminoAcid|Taurine is sometimes called an amino acid, and indeed is an [[acid]] containing an [[amino]] group, it is not an [[amino acid]] in the usual biochemical meaning of the term, which refers to compounds containing both an [[amino]] and a [[carboxyl]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dictionary.com/browse/amino-acid |title=the definition of amino acid |work=Dictionary.com |access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} with a deficiency in this nutrient causing [[macular degeneration]], wherein the cat's retina slowly breaks down, causing irreversible blindness.&lt;ref name="MacDonald" /&gt; This is due to the hepatic activity of cystinesulfinic acid decarboxylase being low in cats.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Schullerlevis |first1=G. |last2=Mehta |first2=P. |last3=Rudelli |first3=R. |last4=Sturman |first4=J. |date=1990 |title=Immunological Consequences of Taurine Deficiency in Cats |journal=Journal of Leukocyte Biology |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=321–331}}&lt;/ref&gt; This limits the ability of cats to [[Biosynthesis|biosynthesize]] the taurine they need from its precursor, the [[amino acid]] [[cysteine]], which ultimately results in inadequate taurine production needed for normal function.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Deficiencies in taurine result in compensated function of feline cardiovascular and reproductive systems.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; These abnormalities can also be accompanied by developmental issues in the central nervous system along with degeneration of the retina.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

[[Niacin]] is an essential vitamin for the cat; dietary deficiency can lead to anorexia, weight loss and an increase in body temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=US National Research Council Subcommittee on Dog and Cat Nutrition |author-link=National Research Council (United States) |date=2006 |chapter-url= http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10668 |chapter=The Role of Vitamins and Minerals in the Diet for Cats |title=Nutrient Requirements of Cats and Dogs |isbn=978-0-309-08628-8 |location=Washington DC |publisher=[[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]]. |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060907101530/http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10668 |archive-date=7 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biosynthesis of [[niacin]] occurs by metabolism of [[tryptophan]] via the [[kynurenine pathway]] to [[quinolinic acid]], the niacin precursor.

Preformed [[vitamin A]] is required in the cat for retinal and reproductive health. Vitamin A is considered to be a fat-soluble vitamin and is seen as essential in a cat's diet. Normally, the conversion of [[beta-carotene]]s into vitamin A occurs in the intestine (more specifically the mucosal layer) of species, however cats lack the ability to undergo this process.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; Both the kidney and liver are contributors to the use of vitamin A in the body of the majority of species while the cats liver does not produce the enzyme [[Beta-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase]] which converts the beta-carotene into [[retinol]] (vitamin A).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Nutritional Requirements of the Cat |date=1982 |journal=Nutrition Reviews |volume=40 |issue=9 |pages=283–285 |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.1982.tb05341.x}}{{complete citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=Author(s) missing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; To summarize: cats do not have high levels of this enzyme leading to the cleavage and oxidation of [[carotenoid]]s not taking place.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

[[Cholecalciferol|Vitamin D3]] is a dietary requirement for cats as they lack the ability to synthesize vitamin D3 from sunlight.&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Girard |first1=N. |last2=Servet |first2=E. |last3=Hennet |first3=P. |last4=Biourge |first4=V. |date=2010 |title=Tooth Resorption and Vitamin D 3 Status in Cats Fed Premium Dry Diets |url= |journal=Journal of Veterinary Dentistry |volume=27 |issue=3|pages=142–147 |doi=10.1177/089875641002700301|pmid=21038831 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats obtain high levels of the enzyme 7-dehydrocholestrol delta 7 reductase which causes immediate conversion of vitamin D3 from sunlight to [[7-dehydrocholesterol]].&lt;ref name=":022"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Morris |first=James G |date=1999 |title=Ineffective vitamin D synthesis in cats is reversed by an inhibitor of 7-dehydrocholesterol-delta(super 7)-reductase |url= |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |volume=129 |issue=4|pages=903–908 |pmid=10203568 |doi=10.1093/jn/129.4.903}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fat soluble vitamin is required in cats for bone formation through the promotion of calcium retention, along with nerve and muscle control through absorption of [[calcium]] and [[phosphorus]].&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt;

Cats, like all mammals, need to get [[linoleic acid]], an [[essential fatty acid]], from their diet. Most mammals can convert linoleic acid to [[arachidonic acid]], as well as the [[omega 3 fatty acids]] ([[eicosapentaenoic acid]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid]]) through the activity of enzymes, but this process is very limited in cats.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; The Δ6-desaturase enzyme eventually converts linoleic acid, which is in its salt form linoleate, to arachidonate (salt form of arachidonic acid) in the liver, but this enzyme has very little activity in cats.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; This means that arachidonic acid is an essential fatty acid for cats as they lack the ability to create required amounts of linoleic acid.  Deficiency of arachidonic acid in cats is related to problems in growth, can cause injury and inflammation to skin (e.g. around the mouth) decreased platelet aggregation, fatty liver, increase in birth defects of kittens whose queens were deficient during pregnancy, and reproductive failure in queens.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; [[Arachidonic acid]] can also be metabolized to [[eicosanoids]] that create inflammatory responses which are needed to stimulate proper growth and repair mechanisms in the cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=MacDonald |first1=M.

To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable [[vibrissa|whiskers (vibrissae)]] over their body, especially their faces.

Most breeds of cat have a noted fondness for settling in high places, or perching. In the wild, a higher place may serve as a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats may strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch, as does a [[leopard]].&lt;ref name="Nash FS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Do Cats Like High Places? |last=Nash |first=Holly |url= http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=1+1313&amp;aid=1125 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080102145008/http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?cls=1&amp;cat=1313&amp;articleid=1125 |archive-date=2 January 2008 |work=PetEducation.com |publisher=[[Drs.

While asleep, cats experience short periods of [[rapid eye movement sleep]] often accompanied by muscle twitches, which suggests they are [[dream]]ing.&lt;ref name="Jouvet 1979"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/0166-2236(79)90110-3 |volume=2 |pages=280–282 |last=Jouvet |first=Michel |title=What Does a Cat Dream About? |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |date=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociability===
[[File:Listen, do you want to know a secret.jpg|thumb|left|[[Social grooming]]]]
Although wildcats are solitary, the social behavior of domestic cats is much more variable and ranges from widely dispersed individuals to [[Feral cat colony|feral cat colonies]] that gather around a food source, based on groups of co-operating females.&lt;ref name="Pontier 1996"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/0376-6357(95)00070-4 |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=85–88 |last1=Pontier |first1=Dominique |last2=Natoli |first2=Eugenia |title=Male Reproductive Success in the Domestic Cat (''Felis catus'' L.): A Case History |journal=Behavioural Processes |date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crowell-davis2004"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Social Organization in the Cat: A Modern Understanding |last1=Crowell-Davis |first1=S.

Outside these neutral areas, territory holders usually chase away stranger cats, at first by staring, hissing, and [[growling]] and, if that does not work, by short but noisy and violent attacks. Despite some cats cohabiting in colonies, they do not have a social survival strategy, or a [[Herd behavior|pack mentality]] and always hunt alone.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw" /&gt;

However, some pet cats are poorly socialized. In particular, older cats may show aggressiveness towards newly arrived kittens, which may include biting and scratching; this type of behavior is known as feline asocial aggression.&lt;ref name="Levine 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Intercat Aggression in Households Following the Introduction of a New Cat |last1=Levine |first1=E. |last2=Perry |first2=P. |last3=Scarlett |first3=J. |last4=Houpt |first4=K. |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |issue=3–4 |date=2005 |pages=325–336 |doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2004.07.006 |volume=90 |access-date=8 April 2009 |url= http://faculty.washington.edu/jcha/330_cats_introducing.pdf |format=PDF |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090326225932/http://faculty.washington.edu/jcha/330_cats_introducing.pdf |archive-date=26 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication===
{{main|Cat communication}}
Domestic cats use many [[Animal communication|vocalizations]] for communication, including [[purr]]ing, [[Trill consonant|trilling]], hissing, [[growling]]/[[snarl]]ing, [[Guttural|grunting]], and several different forms of [[meow]]ing.&lt;ref name="Moelk"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Vocalizing in the House-cat; A Phonetic and Functional Study |last=Moelk |first=Mildred |journal=The American Journal of Psychology |date=April 1944 |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=184–205 |doi=10.2307/1416947 |jstor=1416947}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, feral cats are generally silent.&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Jensen |first=Per |title=The Ethology of Domestic Animals |series="Modular Text" series |publisher=[[Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International]] |location=Wallingford, England |date=2009 |isbn=978-1-84593-536-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|208}} Their types of [[Cat body language|body language]], including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood.

Tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's [[social hierarchy]], with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate animals.&lt;ref name="Cafazzo" /&gt; Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by [[social grooming]], which is solicited by one of the cats raising and tilting its head.&lt;ref name="Crowell-davis2004" /&gt;

===Grooming===

[[File:Housecat Grooming Itself.webm|thumb|A [[tabby cat|tabby]] housecat uses its brush-like tongue to groom itself, licking its fur to straighten it.]]

Cats are known for spending considerable amounts of time licking their coats to keep them clean.&lt;ref name="hairballs" /&gt; The cat's [[tongue]] has backwards-facing spines about 500&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]] long, which are called [[Lingual papilla|papillae]].

Some cats, particularly longhaired cats, occasionally regurgitate [[hairball]]s of fur that have collected in their stomachs from grooming. These clumps of fur are usually sausage-shaped and about {{convert|2|–|3|cm|1|abbr=on}} long. Hairballs can be prevented with remedies that ease elimination of the hair through the [[gut (anatomy)|gut]], as well as regular grooming of the coat with a comb or stiff brush.&lt;ref name="hairballs"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hadzima |first=Eva |title=Everything You Need to Know About Hairballs |date=2016 |url= http://www.dewintonvet.com/everything-you-need-know-about-hairballs/ |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161006104436/http://www.dewintonvet.com/everything-you-need-know-about-hairballs/ |archive-date=6 October 2016

===Fighting===
Among domestic cats, males are more likely to fight than females.&lt;ref name="Lindell"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lindell |first=Ellen M. |title=Intercat Aggression: A Retrospective Study Examining Types of Aggression, Sexes of Fighting Pairs, and Effectiveness of Treatment |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |date=December 1997 |volume=55 |issue=1–2 |pages=153–162 |doi=10.1016/S0168-1591(97)00032-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among feral cats, the most common reason for [[Catfight (animal behavior)|cat fighting]] is competition between two males to mate with a female.

Neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to [[sex hormone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Determining the Optimal age for Gonadectomy of Dogs and Cats |doi=10.2460/javma.231.11.1665 |date=2007 |last1=Kustritz |first1=Margaret V.

[[File:GAto.jpg|thumb|An arched back, raised fur and an open-mouthed hiss can all be signs of aggression in a domestic cat.]]

When cats become aggressive, they try to make themselves appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur, arching their backs, turning sideways and hissing or spitting.&lt;ref name="behaviourguide"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://animal.discovery.com/guides/cats/behavior/bodylanguageintro.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090224154137/http://animal.discovery.com/guides/cats/behavior/bodylanguageintro.html |archive-date=24 February 2009 |title=Cat Behavior: Body Language |work=AnimalPlanet.com |date=2007 |access-date=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward. They may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent. Fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites. Cats also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs.&lt;ref name="HSUS"&gt;{{cite web |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20041214181209/http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pets_for_life_program/cat_behavior_tip_sheets/aggression_between_family_cats.html |url= http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pets_for_life_program/cat_behavior_tip_sheets/aggression_between_family_cats.html |title=Aggression Between Family Cats. |archive-date=14 December 2004 |publisher=[[Humane Society of the United States]] |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious damage is rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser running away with little more than a few scratches to the face and ears. However, fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations. Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated. In addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of [[feline immunodeficiency virus]].&lt;ref name="Pederson 1989"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Feline Immunodeficiency Virus Infection |last1=Pedersen |first1=N.

Perhaps the best known element of cats' hunting behavior, which is commonly misunderstood and often appalls cat owners because it looks like torture, is that cats often appear to "play" with prey by releasing it after capture. This behavior is due to an instinctive imperative to ensure that the prey is weak enough to be killed without endangering the cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Why do cats play with their food? |url= http://azdailysun.com/lifestyles/pets/article_46a97775-232d-5e56-b0ea-dd1c8782b062.html |work=Arizona Daily Sun |access-date=15 August 2011 |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110319041928/http://www.azdailysun.com/lifestyles/pets/article_46a97775-232d-5e56-b0ea-dd1c8782b062.html |archive-date=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior is referred to in the [[idiom]] "cat-and-mouse game" or simply "[[cat and mouse]]".

Another poorly understood element of cat hunting behavior is the presentation of prey to human guardians.

Domestic cats, especially young kittens, are known for their love of play. This behavior mimics hunting and is important in helping kittens learn to [[predation|stalk, capture, and kill]] prey.&lt;ref name="Poirier 1982"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Poirier |first1=F.

Owing to the close similarity between play and hunting, cats prefer to play with objects that resemble prey, such as small furry toys that move rapidly, but rapidly lose interest (they become [[habituation|habituated]]) in a toy they have played with before.&lt;ref name="Hall 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Object Play in Adult Domestic Cats: The Roles of Habituation and Disinhibition |last=Hall |first=Sarah L. |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |date=2002 |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=263–271 |doi=10.1016/S0168-1591(02)00153-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats also tend to play with toys more when they are hungry.&lt;ref name="Hall 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hall |first=Sarah L. |title=The Influence of Hunger on Object Play by Adult Domestic Cats |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |date=June 1998 |volume=58 |issue=1–2 |pages=143–150 |doi=10.1016/S0168-1591(97)00136-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; String is often used as a toy, but if it is eaten, it can become caught at the base of the cat's tongue and then move into the [[intestine]]s, a medical emergency which can cause serious illness, even death.&lt;ref name="MacPhail 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=MacPhail |first=Catriona |title=Gastrointestinal obstruction |journal=Clinical Techniques in Small Animal Practice |date=November 2002 |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=178–183 |doi=10.1053/svms.2002.36606 |pmid=12587284 |pmc=2480448}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the risks posed by cats eating string, it is sometimes replaced with a [[laser pointer]]'s dot, which cats may chase.&lt;ref name="Pocono 2006"&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.poconorecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061210/NEWS01/612100320/-1/NEWS |title=Fat Indoor Cats Need Exercise |date=10 December 2006 |work=[[Pocono Record]] |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090714065943/http://www.poconorecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20061210%2FNEWS01%2F612100320%2F-1%2FNEWS |archive-date=14 July 2009}}{{tertiary|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Radiography of a pregnant cat.jpg|thumb|Radiography of a pregnant cat (about one month and a half)]]
Female cats are seasonally [[polyestrous]], which means they may have many periods of [[Estrus|heat]] over the course of a year, the season beginning in spring and ending in late autumn. Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last about 4 to 7 days.&lt;ref name="compendium" /&gt; Multiple males will be attracted to a female in heat. The males will fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female rejects the male, but eventually the female allows the male to mate. The female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120–150 backwards-pointing [[penile spines]], which are about 1&amp;nbsp;mm long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's [[vagina]], which acts to [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induce ovulation]]. This act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm in the context of a second (or more) mating, thus giving the later males a larger chance of conception.&lt;ref name="Aronson 1967"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Penile Spines of the Domestic Cat: Their Endocrine-behavior Relations |last1=Aronson |first1=L.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After mating, the female washes her [[vulva]] thoroughly. If a male attempts to mate with her at this point, the female will attack him. After about 20 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.&lt;ref name="compendium" /&gt;

Because ovulation is not always triggered by a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate.&lt;ref name="Wildt 1980"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Wildt |first1=D.

They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas.&lt;ref name="Rochlitz" /&gt; The numbers of feral cats is not known, but estimates of the US feral population range from 25 to 60&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Rochlitz" /&gt; Feral cats may live alone, but most are found in large [[feral cat colony|colonies]], which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food.&lt;ref name="hsus-feral"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hsus.org/pets/issues_affecting_our_pets/feral_cats/feral_cats_frequently_asked_questions.html#1_What_is_a_feral_cat |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080501093143/http://www.hsus.org/pets/issues_affecting_our_pets/feral_cats/feral_cats_frequently_asked_questions.html#1_What_is_a_feral_cat |archive-date=1 May 2008 |title=What is the difference between a stray cat and a feral cat? |publisher=[[Humane Society of the United States]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous feral cat colonies are found in Rome around the [[Colosseum]] and [[Forum Romanum]], with cats at some of these sites being fed and given medical attention by volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.romancats.com/index_eng.php |title=Torre Argentina cat shelter. |access-date=17 June 2009 |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090122203413/http://www.romancats.com/index_eng.php |archive-date=22 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public attitudes towards feral cats vary widely, ranging from seeing them as free-ranging pets, to regarding them as vermin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Humane Society of the United States |isbn=978-0-9658942-7-2 |last1=Rowan |first1=Andrew N. |last2=Salem |first2=Deborah J. |title=The State of the Animals II: 2003 |date=November 2003 |chapter=4 |chapter-url= http://www.hsus.org/web-files/PDF/hsp/SOA_3-2005_Chap4.pdf |format=PDF

Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.&lt;ref name="hsus-feral" /&gt;

===Impact on prey species===
[[File:Cat eating a rabbit.jpeg|thumb|left|Carrying half of a rabbit]]
To date, little scientific data is available to assess the impact of cat predation on prey populations outside of agricultural situations. Even well-fed domestic cats may hunt and kill, mainly catching small mammals, but also birds, amphibians, reptiles, fish, and invertebrates.&lt;ref name="Woods"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Woods |first1=M. |last2=McDonald |first2=R.

For example, cats can control the numbers of rats, which also prey on birds' eggs and young, so a cat population can protect an endangered bird species by suppressing [[Mesopredator release hypothesis|mesopredators]].&lt;ref name="pmid18083843"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Spatial Heterogeneity of Mesopredator Release within an Oceanic Island System |last1=Rayner |first1=M.

Even in places with ancient and numerous cat populations, such as [[Western Europe]], cats appear to be growing in number and independently of their environments' [[carrying capacity]] (such as the numbers of prey available).&lt;ref name="Liberg 1982"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Food Habits and Prey Impact by Feral and House-based Domestic Cats in a Rural Area in Southern Sweden |last=Liberg |first=O. |journal=Journal of Mammalogy |date=1982 |volume=65 |pages=424–432 |doi=10.2307/1381089 |issue=3 |jstor=1381089}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="May, R., 1988"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Control of Feline Delinquency |last=May |first=R. |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date=1988 |volume=332 |pages=392–393 |doi=10.1038/332392a0 |issue=6163 |bibcode=1988Natur.332..392M}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be explained, at least in part, by an abundance of food, from sources including feeding by pet owners and scavenging. For instance, research in [[Great Britain|Britain]] suggests that a high proportion of cats hunt only "recreationally",&lt;ref name="May, R., 1988" /&gt; and in [[South Sweden]], where research in 1982 found that the population density of cats was as high as {{convert|2000|/sqkm|/sqmi}}.&lt;ref name="Liberg 1982" /&gt;

===Impact on birds===
[[File:Cat-eating-prey.jpg|thumb|A black cat eating a [[house sparrow]]]]
The domestic cat is a significant predator of birds. UK assessments indicate they may be accountable for an estimated 64.8&amp;nbsp;million bird deaths each year.&lt;ref name="Woods" /&gt; A 2012 study suggests feral cats may kill several billion birds each year in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/01/30/cat_videos_cat_killing_spree/|title=You thought watching cat videos was harmless fun?

Some of the same factors that have promoted [[adaptive radiation]] of island [[Bird|avifauna]] over evolutionary time appear to promote vulnerability to non-native species in modern time.

===Cat show===
{{main|Cat show}}
A [[cat show]] is a judged event in which the owners of cats compete to win titles in various cat registering organizations by entering their cats to be judged after a breed standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://animals.howstuffworks.com/pets/cat-show1.htm|title=All About Cat Shows|date=2 April 2008|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=8 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://animals.howstuffworks.com/pets/cat-show.htm|title=All About Cat Shows|date=2 April 2008|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=8 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[pedigree (cat)|pedigreed]] and companion (or moggy) cats are admissible, although the rules differ from organization to organization.  Cats are compared to a breed standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://animals.howstuffworks.com/pets/cat-show1.htm|title=All About Cat Shows|date=2 April 2008|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=26 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the owners of those judged to be closest to it are awarded a prize. Moggies are judged based on their temperament. Often, at the end of the year, all of the points accrued at various shows are added up and more national and regional titles are awarded.

===Cat café===
{{main|Cat café}}
A [[cat café]] is a theme [[café]] whose attraction is cats that can be watched and played with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/cat-cafe |title=cat café |website=Cambridge English Dictionary |access-date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ailurophobia===
{{main|Ailurophobia}}
[[Ailurophobia]] is a human [[phobia]] of cats; however, the term is often associated with humans that have a hatred of cats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/234/3.html Bartleby: Ailurophobes and Other Cat-Haters] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171223220422/http://www.bartleby.com/234/3.html |date=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cat bites===
{{Main|Cat bite}}
Cats may bite humans when provoked, during play or when aggressive. Complications from cat bites can develop.&lt;ref name=kidshealth&gt;{{cite web |url= https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/animal-bites-sheet.html?WT.ac=p-ra |title=First Aid: Animal Bites |publisher=[[Nemours Foundation]] |access-date=18 June 2017 |date=2017 |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170518170950/http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/animal-bites-sheet.html?WT.ac=p-ra |archive-date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cat bite differs from the bites of other pets. This is because the teeth of a cat are sharp and pointed causing deep [[wound|punctures]]. Skin usually closes rapidly over the bite and traps [[microorganisms]] that cause [[infection]].&lt;ref name=assh&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.assh.org/handcare/hand-arm-injuries/animal-bites-treatment |title=Animal Bites |publisher=[[American Society for Surgery of the Hand]] |date=2017 |work=HandCare.org |access-date=18 June 2017 |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170728015622/http://www.assh.org/handcare/hand-arm-injuries/animal-bites-treatment |archive-date=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kidshealth /&gt;

===Infections transmitted from cats to humans===
{{Main|Feline zoonosis}}

Cats can be [[infection|infected]] or infested with [[virus]]es, [[pathogenic bacteria|bacteria]], [[fungus]], [[protozoans]], [[arthropod]]s or worms that can transmit diseases to humans.&lt;ref name="Chomel2014" /&gt; In some cases, the cat exhibits no [[symptoms]] of the disease,&lt;ref name=Ohio2016&gt;{{cite web |title=Cats |publisher=[[Ohio Department of Health]] |url= http://www.odh.ohio.gov/en/odhprograms/bid/zdp/animals/cats |access-date=26 November 2016 |date=21 January 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161127023823/http://www.odh.ohio.gov/en/odhprograms/bid/zdp/animals/cats |archive-date=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same disease can then become evident in a human.  The likelihood that a person will become diseased depends on the age and [[immunity (medical)|immune]] status of the person. Humans who have cats living in their home or in close association are more likely to become infected, however, those who do not keep cats as pets might also acquire infections from cat [[feces]] and [[parasite]]s exiting the cat's body.&lt;ref name="Chomel2014"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chomel |first=Bruno |title=Emerging and Re-Emerging Zoonoses of Dogs and Cats |journal=Animals |volume=4 |issue=3 |date=2014 |pages=434–445 |issn=2076-2615 |doi=10.3390/ani4030434 |pmid=26480316 |pmc=4494318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StullBrophy2015"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Stull |first1=J.

====Superstitions and cat burning====
[[File:Close up of a black domestic cat.jpg|225px|right|thumb|Some cultures are superstitious about black cats, ascribing either good or bad luck to them.]]
Many cultures have negative [[superstition]]s about cats. An example would be the belief that a [[black cat]] "crossing one's path" leads to bad luck, or that cats are witches' [[familiar spirit|familiars]] used to augment a witch's powers and skills. The killing of cats in Medieval [[Ypres]], [[Belgium]], is commemorated in the innocuous present-day [[Kattenstoet]] (cat parade).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Are Black Cats Really Bad Luck? [Hoax] |url= http://socialnewsdaily.com/58901/are-black-cats-really-bad-luck-hoax/ |website=SocialNewsDaily.com |access-date=19 December 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151222141607/http://socialnewsdaily.com/58901/are-black-cats-really-bad-luck-hoax/ |archive-date=22 December 2015|date= 2015-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval France, cats would be burnt alive as a form of entertainment. According to [[Norman Davies]], the assembled people "shrieked with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally [[Carbonization|carbonized]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Davies |first=Norman |title=Europe: A History |date=1996 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-198-20171-7 |page=543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"It was the custom to burn a basket, barrel, or sack full of live cats, which was hung from a tall mast in the midst of the bonfire; sometimes a [[fox]] was burned. The people collected the embers and ashes of the fire and took them home, believing that they brought good luck. The French kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own hands. In 1648 [[Louis XIV]], crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall. But this was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in Paris. At [[Metz]] midsummer fires were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in [[wicker]] cages, were burned alive in them, to the amusement of the people. Similarly at [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]], in the [[Departments of France|department]] of the [[Hautes-Alpes]], cats used to be roasted over the midsummer bonfire."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Frazer|Frazer, Sir James George]]. ''The Golden Bough'', (1922).

According to a myth in many cultures, cats have multiple lives. In many countries, they are believed to have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil and some Spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://elcomercio.pe/impresa/notas/vidas-gato/20100307/423959 |date=7 March 2010 |access-date=19 March 2010 |first=Nora |last=Sugobono |language=es |title=Las vidas del gato |work=[[El Comercio (Peru)|El Comercio]]  |location=Lima, Peru |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120127052854/http://elcomercio.pe/impresa/notas/vidas-gato/20100307/423959 |archive-date=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Qual é a origem da lenda de que os gatos teriam sete vidas?|url= http://mundoestranho.abril.com.br/materia/qual-e-a-origem-da-lenda-de-que-os-gatos-teriam-sete-vidas |language=pt-BR |website=[[Mundo Estranho]] |publisher=[[Abril Media]] |location=São Paulo, Brazil |access-date=15 November 2015|dead-url=no|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151117031757/http://mundoestranho.abril.com.br/materia/qual-e-a-origem-da-lenda-de-que-os-gatos-teriam-sete-vidas|archive-date=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Turkish and Arabic traditions, the number of lives is six.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=[[The Guardian]] |url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2010/mar/18/guide-to-pets-pet-myths?picture=360591960 |access-date=18 March 2010 |first=Tim |last=Dowling |title=Tall tails: Pet myths busted |date=19 March 2010 |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130909160834/http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2010/mar/18/guide-to-pets-pet-myths?picture=360591960|archive-date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations. Also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive [[cat righting reflex|righting reflex]] to twist their bodies around. Nonetheless, cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cats.about.com/od/catsafety/a/highrisefalls.htm |title=The ASPCA Warns About High-Rise Falls by Cats: High-Rise Apartments, Windows, Terraces and Fire Escapes Pose Risk to Urban Cats |date=30 June 2005 |author=&lt;!--staff writer(s)--&gt; |publisher=[[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] |via=About.com |access-date=6 June 2018 |location=New York |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120522014805/http://cats.about.com/od/catsafety/a/highrisefalls.htm |archive-date=22 May 2012}} (Press release.)&lt;/ref&gt;
