An '''apple''' is a sweet, edible [[fruit]] produced by an '''apple tree''' ('''''Malus pumila'''''). Apple [[fruit tree|trees]] are [[agriculture|cultivated]] worldwide, and are the most widely grown species in the [[genus]] ''[[Malus]]''. The tree originated in [[Central Asia]], where its wild ancestor, ''[[Malus sieversii]]'', is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in [[Asia]] and [[Europe]], and were brought to North America by [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]]. Apples have religious and [[mythology|mythological]] significance in many cultures, including [[Norse mythology|Norse]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Christianity in Europe|European Christian traditions]].

Apple trees are large if grown from seed.  Generally apple [[cultivar]]s are propagated by [[grafting]] onto [[Rootstock|rootstocks]], which control the size of the resulting tree. There are more than 7,500 known [[List of apple cultivars|cultivars of apples]], resulting in a range of desired characteristics. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including [[cooking apple|cooking]], eating raw and [[apple cider|cider]] production. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of [[fungus|fungal]], bacterial and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of [[organic farming|organic]] and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's [[genome]] was [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]] as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.

Worldwide production of apples in 2014 was 84.6&amp;nbsp;million [[tonnes]], with China accounting for 48% of the total.&lt;ref name=faostat/&gt;

==Botanical information==

[[File:Koeh-108.jpg|thumb|right|Blossoms, fruits, and leaves of the apple tree (''Malus pumila'')]]
[[File:Pink lady and cross section.jpg|thumb|right|An apple's side, stem end, and interior]]
The apple is a [[deciduous]] tree, generally standing {{convert|6|to|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall in cultivation and up to {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} in the wild.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treenames.net/ti/malus/index_apple_tree.html |title=Types and names of Apple Trees, Species of the Malus Genus |publisher=Treenames.net |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by [[rootstock]] selection and trimming method. The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[leaf arrangement|alternately arranged]] dark green-colored simple ovals with serrated margins and slightly downy undersides.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;
[[File:Apple Blossom @ Manali.jpg|thumb|Apple blossom]]

[[Blossoms]] are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves, and are produced on spurs and some long shoots. The {{convert|3|to|4|cm|abbr=on|sp=us}} flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five [[petal]]ed, with an [[inflorescence]] consisting of a [[cyme (botany)|cyme]] with 4–6 flowers. The central flower of the inflorescence is called the "king bloom"; it opens first, and can develop a larger fruit.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/british-natural-history/urban-tree-survey/identify-trees/tree-factsheets/a-to-b/apple/ |title=Apple |publisher=Natural History Museum |accessdate=5 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105062530/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/british-natural-history/urban-tree-survey/identify-trees/tree-factsheets/a-to-b/apple/ |archivedate=5 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fruit matures in late summer or autumn, and cultivars exist with a wide range of sizes. Commercial growers aim to produce an apple that is {{convert|2+3/4|to|3+1/4|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, due to market preference. Some consumers, especially those in Japan, prefer a larger apple, while apples below {{convert|2+1/4|in|cm|abbr=on}} are generally used for making juice and have little fresh market value. The skin of ripe apples is generally red, yellow, green, pink, or [[russetted]] although many bi- or tri-colored cultivars may be found.&lt;ref name=Janick&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/pri/chapter.pdf |format=PDF |page=9 |chapter=Chapter 1: Apples |author1=Jules Janick |author2=James N.

===Wild ancestors===
{{Main|Malus sieversii}}
The original wild [[ancestor]] of ''Malus pumila'' was ''Malus sieversii'', found growing wild in the [[mountains of Central Asia]] in southern [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Xinjiang]], China.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;&lt;ref name="Architecture and size relations: an essay on the apple (Malus x domestica, Rosaceae) tree"/&gt; Cultivation of the species, most likely beginning on the forested flanks of the [[Tian Shan]] mountains, progressed over a long period of time and permitted secondary [[introgression]] of genes from other species into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange with ''[[Malus sylvestris]]'', the crabapple, resulted in current populations of apples being more related to crabapples than to the more [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]] similar progenitor ''Malus sieversii''. In strains without recent admixture the contribution of the latter predominates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1002703 |title=New Insight into the History of Domesticated Apple: Secondary Contribution of the European Wild Apple to the Genome of Cultivated Varieties |author=Amandine Cornille |journal=PLOS Genetics |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002703 |year=2012 |editor1-last=Mauricio |editor1-first=Rodney |last2=Gladieux |first2=Pierre |last3=Smulders |first3=Marinus J.

===Genome===
In 2010, an Italian-led consortium announced they had sequenced the complete [[genome]] of the apple in collaboration with horticultural genomicists at [[Washington State University]],&lt;ref name="ClarkB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cahnrsnews.wsu.edu/2010/08/29/apple-cup-rivals-contribute-to-apple-genome-sequencing/ |author=Clark Brian |title=Apple Cup Rivals Contribute to Apple Genome Sequencing |publisher=Cahnrsnews.wsu.edu |date=29 August 2010 |accessdate=28 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520105156/http://cahnrsnews.wsu.edu/2010/08/29/apple-cup-rivals-contribute-to-apple-genome-sequencing/ |archivedate=20 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; using '[[Golden Delicious]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v42/n10/full/ng.654.html |title=The genome of the domesticated apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.) |publisher=Nature.com |accessdate=28 December 2012 |volume=42 |issue=10 |doi=10.1038/ng.654 |journal=Nature Genetics |pages=833–839 |pmid=20802477 |date=October 2010 |last1=Velasco |first1=R |last2=Zharkikh |first2=A |last3=Affourtit |first3=J |display-authors=etal |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213032323/http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v42/n10/full/ng.654.html |archivedate=13 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had about 57,000 genes, the highest number of any plant genome studied to date&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alphagalileo.org/ViewItem.aspx?ItemId=83717&amp;CultureCode=en An Italian-led international research consortium decodes the apple genome] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905085301/http://www.alphagalileo.org/ViewItem.aspx?ItemId=83717&amp;CultureCode=en |date=5 September 2010 }} AlphaGallileo 29 August 2010.

Understanding the genes behind these characteristics will allow scientists to perform more knowledgeable selective breeding. The genome sequence also provided proof that ''Malus sieversii'' was the wild ancestor of the domestic apple—an issue that had been long-debated in the scientific community.&lt;ref name="ClarkB"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:95apple.jpeg|thumb|alt=color photograph of a hand holding a red apple|Wild ''Malus sieversii'' apple in [[Kazakhstan]]]]

The center of diversity of the genus ''[[Malus]]'' is in eastern present-day [[Turkey]]. The apple tree was perhaps the earliest tree to be cultivated,&lt;ref name=app6/&gt; and its fruits have been improved through selection over thousands of years. [[Alexander the Great]] is credited with finding dwarfed apples in [[Kazakhstan]] in 328 [[BCE]].&lt;ref name=app/&gt; Winter apples, picked in late autumn and stored just above freezing, have been an important food in Asia and Europe for millennia.&lt;ref name=app6&gt;{{cite web |website=Vegetarians in Paradise |url=http://www.vegparadise.com/highestperch39.html |title=An apple a day keeps the doctor away |accessdate=27 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211100203/http://www.vegparadise.com/highestperch39.html |archivedate=11 February 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the many Old World plants that the Spanish introduced to [[Chiloé Archipelago]] in the [[16th century]], apple trees became particularly well adapted.&lt;ref name=Torrejonetal2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Torrejón |first1=Fernando |last2=Cisternas |first2=Marco |last3=Araneda |first3=Alberto |date=2004 |title=Efectos ambientales de la colonización española desde el río Maullín al archipiélago de Chiloé, sur de Chile |trans-title=Environmental effects of the spanish colonization from de Maullín river to the Chiloé archipelago, southern Chile |url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0716-078X2004000400009&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=en |journal=[[Revista Chilena de Historia Natural]] |volume=77 |issue= 4|pages=661–677 |doi=10.4067/s0716-078x2004000400009 |access-date= |language=Spanish |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018190900/http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0716-078X2004000400009&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=en |archivedate=18 October 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apples were introduced to North America by colonists in the [[17th century]],&lt;ref name=app/&gt; and the first apple orchard on the North American continent was planted in [[Boston]] by Reverend [[William Blaxton]] in 1625.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Archibald William |title=A Gardener's Handbook of Plant Names: Their Meanings and Origins |year=1997 |publisher=Dover Publications |isbn=0-486-29715-2 |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only apples native to North America are [[crab apples]], which were once called "common apples".&lt;ref name="lawrence122"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lawrence |first=James |title=The Harrowsmith Reader, Volume II |year=1980 |publisher=Camden House Publishing Ltd. |isbn=0-920656-10-2 |page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple cultivars brought as seed from Europe were spread along Native American trade routes, as well as being cultivated on colonial farms. An 1845 United States apples nursery catalogue sold 350 of the "best" cultivars, showing the proliferation of new North American cultivars by the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="lawrence122"/&gt; In the 20th century, irrigation projects in [[Eastern Washington]] began and allowed the development of the multibillion-dollar fruit industry, of which the apple is the leading product.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;

Until the 20th century, farmers stored apples in [[Root cellar|frostproof cellars]] during the winter for their own use or for sale. Improved transportation of fresh apples by train and road replaced the necessity for storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9KwPofkJTHYC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=%22apple+cellar%22+history+.edu+-,com+-.com#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=History of Bergen county, New Jersey |author=James M.

==Society and culture==
{{Main|Apple (symbolism)}}

===Germanic paganism===
[[File:Carl Larsson Brita as Iduna.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=Illustration of girl in a red dress, holding 3 candles in one hand and a basket of apples in the other|"Brita as [[Iðunn|Iduna]]" (1901) by [[Carl Larsson]]]]
In [[Norse mythology]], the goddess [[Iðunn]] is portrayed in the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' (written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]) as providing apples to the [[gods]] that give them [[eternal youth]]fulness. English scholar [[H. R. Ellis Davidson]] links apples to religious practices in [[Germanic paganism]], from which [[Norse paganism]] developed. She points out that buckets of apples were found in the [[Oseberg ship]] burial site in Norway, and that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'') have been found in the early graves of the [[Germanic peoples]] in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of [[fertility]] in southwest England.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Davidson notes a connection between apples and the [[Vanir]], a tribe of gods associated with [[fertility]] in Norse mythology, citing an instance of eleven "golden apples" being given to woo the beautiful [[Gerðr]] by [[Skírnir]], who was acting as messenger for the major Vanir god [[Freyr]] in stanzas 19 and 20 of ''[[Skírnismál]]''. Davidson also notes a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology in chapter 2 of the ''[[Völsunga saga]]'' when the major goddess [[Frigg]] sends King [[Rerir]] an apple after he prays to Odin for a child, Frigg's messenger (in the guise of a crow) drops the apple in his lap as he sits atop a [[tumulus|mound]].&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON165-166"/&gt; Rerir's wife's consumption of the apple results in a six-year pregnancy and the [[Caesarean section]] birth of their son—the hero [[Völsung]].&lt;ref name="DAVIDSONROLES146-147"/&gt;

Further, Davidson points out the "strange" phrase "Apples of [[Hel (location)|Hel]]" used in an 11th-century poem by the [[skald]] Thorbiorn Brúnarson. She states this may imply that the apple was thought of by Brúnarson as the food of the dead. Further, Davidson notes that the potentially Germanic goddess [[Nehalennia]] is sometimes depicted with apples and that parallels exist in early Irish stories. Davidson asserts that while cultivation of the apple in Northern Europe extends back to at least the time of the [[Roman Empire]] and came to Europe from the [[Near East]], the native varieties of apple trees growing in Northern Europe are small and bitter. Davidson concludes that in the figure of Iðunn "we must have a dim reflection of an old symbol: that of the guardian goddess of the life-giving fruit of the other world."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

===Greek mythology===
[[File:Hercules Musei Capitolini MC1265 n2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.6|[[Heracles]] with the apple of [[Hesperides]]]]
Apples appear in many [[World religions|religious traditions]], often as a mystical or [[forbidden fruit]]. One of the problems identifying apples in religion, [[mythology]] and [[Folklore|folktales]] is that the word "apple" was used as a generic term for all (foreign) fruit, other than berries, including nuts, as late as the 17th century.&lt;ref name="app3"/&gt; For instance, in [[Greek mythology]], the [[Greek hero]] [[Heracles]], as a part of his [[Labours of Hercules|Twelve Labours]], was required to travel to the Garden of the Hesperides and pick the golden apples off the [[Hesperides#The Garden of the Hesperides|Tree of Life]] growing at its center.&lt;ref name=book1&gt;{{cite book |last=Wasson |first=R.

The Greek goddess of discord, [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], became disgruntled after she was excluded from the wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae2.html |title=Fabulae |author=Hyginus |chapter=92 |chapter-url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae2.html#92 |translator=Mary Grant |website=Theoi Project |access-date=7 December 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209204358/http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae2.html |archivedate=9 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation, she tossed a [[Apple of Discord|golden apple]] inscribed [[Kallisti|Καλλίστη]] (''Kalliste'', sometimes transliterated ''Kallisti'', "For the most beautiful one"), into the wedding party. Three goddesses claimed the apple: [[Hera]], [[Athena]], and [[Aphrodite]]. [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] of [[Troy]] was appointed to select the recipient. After being bribed by both Hera and Athena, Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world, [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] of [[Sparta]]. He awarded the apple to Aphrodite, thus indirectly causing the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lucian |title=Dialogues of the Gods |url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/LucianDialoguesGods1.html |chapter=The Judgement of Paris |chapter-url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/LucianDialoguesGods1.html#0 |translator=H.

The apple was thus considered, in ancient Greece, to be sacred to Aphrodite, and to throw an apple at someone was to symbolically declare one's love; and similarly, to catch it was to symbolically show one's acceptance of that love. An epigram claiming authorship by Plato states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Edmonds |first=J.M. |editor1-first=John M. |editor1-last=Cooper |editor2-last=Hutchinson |editor2-first=D.S. |chapter=Epigrams |title=Plato: Complete Works |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fv9AKY_DBVYC&amp;pg=PR5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=Indianapolis |publisher=Hackett Publishing Co. |publication-date=1997 |page=1744 |isbn=9780872203495 |access-date=7 December 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327160147/https://books.google.com/books?id=Fv9AKY_DBVYC&amp;pg=PR5&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=27 March 2018 |df=dmy-all |year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Atalanta]], also of Greek mythology, raced all her suitors in an attempt to avoid marriage. She outran all but [[Hippomenes]] (also known as [[Melanion]], a name possibly derived from ''melon'' the Greek word for both "apple" and fruit in general),&lt;ref name=book2/&gt; who defeated her by cunning, not speed. Hippomenes knew that he could not win in a fair race, so he used three golden apples (gifts of Aphrodite, the goddess of love) to distract Atalanta. It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Hippomenes was finally successful, winning the race and Atalanta's hand.&lt;ref name=book1/&gt;

Though the forbidden fruit of [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] in the [[Book of Genesis]] is not identified, popular Christian tradition has held that it was an apple that [[Eve]] coaxed [[Adam]] to share with her.&lt;ref name="book7"/&gt; The origin of the popular identification with a fruit unknown in the Middle East in biblical times is found in confusion between the [[Latin language|Latin]] words ''mālum'' (an apple) and ''mălum'' (an evil), each of which is normally written ''malum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lotBnvqdmeQC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=Genesis+apple#v=onepage&amp;q=Genesis%20apple&amp;f=false |first=Paul J |last=Kissling |title=Genesis |publisher=College Press |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-89900875-2 |volume=1 |page=193 |website=Books.google.com |accessdate=25 August 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926082746/http://books.google.com/books?id=lotBnvqdmeQC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=Genesis+apple&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KZjfUb7DBquf7AaY5YCIDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Genesis%20apple&amp;f=false |archivedate=26 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tree of the forbidden fruit is called "the tree of the knowledge of good and evil" in {{bibleverse||Genesis|2:17|ESV}}, and the Latin for "good and evil" is ''bonum et malum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xBPpIHwcZMUC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=Genesis+apple+malum#v=onepage&amp;q=Genesis%20apple%20malum&amp;f=false |first=Ronald |last=Hendel |title=The Book of Genesis: A Biography |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2012 |isbn=978-0-69114012-4 |page=114 |website=Books.google.com |accessdate=25 August 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002030209/http://books.google.com/books?id=xBPpIHwcZMUC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=Genesis+apple+malum&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DpzfUY64Gamu7Aboz4GIDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Genesis%20apple%20malum&amp;f=false |archivedate=2 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renaissance]] painters may also have been influenced by the story of the [[golden apple]]s in the [[Hesperides#The Garden of the Hesperides|Garden of Hesperides]]. As a result, in the story of Adam and Eve, the apple became a symbol for knowledge, immortality, temptation, the fall of man into sin, and sin itself. The [[larynx]] in the human throat has been called the "[[Adam's apple]]" because of a notion that it was caused by the forbidden fruit remaining in the throat of Adam.&lt;ref name="book7" /&gt; The apple as symbol of sexual [[seduction]] has been used to imply human sexuality, possibly in an ironic vein.&lt;ref name=book7/&gt;

The UK's national fruit collection database contains a wealth of information on the characteristics and origin of many apples, including alternative names for what is essentially the same "genetic" apple cultivar. Most of these cultivars are bred for eating fresh (dessert apples), though some are cultivated specifically for cooking ([[cooking apple]]s) or producing [[cider]]. [[Cider apple]]s are typically too tart and astringent to eat fresh, but they give the beverage a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot.&lt;ref name="apples1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://casfs.ucsc.edu/publications/news%20and%20notes/Fall_06_N&amp;N.pdf  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811154017/http://casfs.ucsc.edu/publications/news%20and%20notes/Fall_06_N%26N.pdf  |dead-url=yes  |archive-date=11 August 2007 |title=Autumn Apple Musings |accessdate=24 January 2008 |format=PDF |pages=1–2 |author=Sue Tarjan |publisher=News &amp; Notes of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden, Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems |date=Fall 2006 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercially popular apple cultivars are soft but crisp. Other desired qualities in modern commercial apple breeding are a colorful skin, absence of [[Russet apple|russeting]], ease of shipping, lengthy storage ability, high yields, disease resistance, common apple shape, and developed flavor.&lt;ref name="England"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plantpress.com/wildlife/o523-apple.php |title=Apple – Malus domestica |accessdate=22 January 2008 |publisher=Natural England |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512000735/http://www.plantpress.com/wildlife/o523-apple.php |archivedate=12 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern apples are generally sweeter than older cultivars, as popular tastes in apples have varied over time.

Old cultivars are often oddly shaped, russeted, and have a variety of textures and colors. Some find them to have a better flavor than modern cultivars,&lt;ref name="Crops &amp; Gardening - Apples of Antiquity"/&gt; but they may have other problems which make them commercially unviable—low yield, disease susceptibility, poor tolerance for storage or transport, or just being the "wrong" size. A few old cultivars are still produced on a large scale, but many have been preserved by home gardeners and farmers that sell directly to local markets. Many unusual and locally important cultivars with their own unique taste and appearance exist; apple conservation campaigns have sprung up around the world to preserve such local cultivars from extinction. In the United Kingdom, old cultivars such as '[[Cox's Orange Pippin]]' and '[[Egremont Russet]]' are still commercially important even though by modern standards they are low yielding and susceptible to disease.&lt;ref name=app&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uga.edu/fruit/apple.html |title=Origin, History of cultivation |accessdate=22 January 2008 |publisher=[[University of Georgia]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121045236/http://www.uga.edu/fruit/apple.html |archivedate=21 January 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many apples grow readily from seeds. However, more than with most perennial fruits, apples must be propagated asexually by [[grafting]] to obtain the sweetness and other desirable characteristics of the parent. This is because seedling apples are an example of "[[Zygosity|extreme heterozygotes]]", in that rather than inheriting genes from their parents to create a new apple with parental characteristics, they are instead significantly different from their parents, perhaps to compete with the many pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] and [[John Mitchinson (researcher)|John Mitchinson]] |title=QI: The Complete First Series – QI Factoids |medium=DVD |publisher=2 entertain |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polyploid|Triploid]] cultivars have an additional reproductive barrier in that 3 sets of chromosomes cannot be divided evenly during meiosis, yielding unequal segregation of the chromosomes (aneuploids). Even in the case when a triploid plant can produce a seed (apples are an example), it occurs infrequently, and seedlings rarely survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Thomas G. |last=Ranney |url=http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/fletcher/programs/nursery/metria/metria11/ranney/index.html |title=Polyploidy: From Evolution to Landscape Plant Improvement |book-title=Proceedings of the 11th Metropolitan Tree Improvement Alliance (METRIA) Conference |conference=11th Metropolitan Tree Improvement Alliance (METRIA) Conference held in Gresham, Oregon, August 23–24, 2000 |conference-url=https://www.ces.ncsu.edu/fletcher/programs/nursery/metria/metria11/index.html |website=METRIA (NCSU.edu) |publisher=METRIA |accessdate=7 November 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723170402/http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/fletcher/programs/nursery/metria/metria11/ranney/index.html |archivedate=23 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because apples do not [[True-breeding organism|breed true]] when planted as seeds, [[grafting]] is generally used to produce new apple trees. The [[rootstock]] used for the bottom of the graft can be selected to produce trees of a large variety of sizes, as well as changing the winter hardiness, insect and disease resistance, and soil preference of the resulting tree. Dwarf rootstocks can be used to produce very small trees (less than {{convert|10|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} high at maturity), which bear fruit earlier in their life cycle than full size trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://extension.unh.edu/resources/files/resource000583_rep605.pdf |format=PDF |title=Dwarf Rootstocks for Apple Trees in the Home Garden |publisher=University of New Hampshire |author1=William G.

The [[East Malling Research Station]] conducted extensive research into rootstocks, and today their rootstocks are given an "M" prefix to designate their origin. Rootstocks marked with an "MM" prefix are Malling-series cultivars later crossed with trees of '[[Northern Spy]]' in [[London Borough of Merton|Merton, England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/hil/hil-300-a.html |title=Apple Rootstocks and Tree Spacing |date=September 1993 |accessdate=1 September 2013 |author=ML Parker |publisher=North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911051127/http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/hil/hil-300-a.html |archivedate=11 September 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most new apple cultivars originate as seedlings, which either arise by chance or are bred by deliberately crossing cultivars with promising characteristics.&lt;ref name=book9&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferree |first=David Curtis |author2=Ian J. Warrington |title=Apples: Botany, Production and Uses |publisher=CABI Publishing |isbn=0-85199-357-5 |year=1999 |oclc=182530169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words "seedling", "pippin", and "kernel" in the name of an apple cultivar suggest that it originated as a seedling. Apples can also form [[bud sport]]s (mutations on a single branch). Some bud sports turn out to be improved strains of the parent cultivar. Some differ sufficiently from the parent tree to be considered new cultivars.&lt;ref name=app4&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheets/HGIC1350.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228131352/http://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheets/HGIC1350.htm |archivedate=28 February 2008 |title=Apple |accessdate=22 January 2008 |author=Bob Polomski |author2=Greg Reighard |publisher=Clemson University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1930s, the Excelsior Experiment Station at the [[University of Minnesota]] has introduced a steady progression of important apples that are widely grown, both commercially and by local orchardists, throughout [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]]. Its most important contributions have included '[[Haralson (apple)|Haralson]]' (which is the most widely cultivated apple in Minnesota), '[[Wealthy (apple)|Wealthy]]', 'Honeygold', and '[[Honeycrisp]]'.

Apples have been acclimatized in Ecuador at very high altitudes, where they can often, with the needed factors, provide crops twice per year because of constant temperate conditions year-round.&lt;ref name="Apples in Ecuador"/&gt;

===Pollination===
{{See also| Fruit tree pollination}}
[[File:Apple tree blossom.JPG|right|thumb|Apple blossom from an old [[Ayrshire]] cultivar]]
[[File:Orchmason.jpg|thumb|[[Orchard mason bee]] on apple bloom, [[British Columbia]], Canada]]

Apples are self-incompatible; they must [[Pollination|cross-pollinate]] to develop fruit. During the flowering each season, apple growers often utilize [[pollinator]]s to carry pollen. [[Honey bee]]s are most commonly used. [[Osmia lignaria|Orchard mason bees]] are also used as supplemental pollinators in commercial orchards. [[Bumblebee]] [[queen bee|queens]] are sometimes present in orchards, but not usually in enough quantity to be significant pollinators.&lt;ref name=app4/&gt;&lt;ref name="An Assessment of Non-Apis Bees as Fruit and Vegetable Crop Pollinators in Southwest Virginia"&gt;Adamson, Nancy Lee. [http://www.step-project.net/NPDOCS/Adamson_NL_D_2011.pdf An Assessment of Non-Apis Bees as Fruit and Vegetable Crop Pollinators in Southwest Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120230411/http://www.step-project.net/NPDOCS/Adamson_NL_D_2011.pdf |date=20 November 2015 }}. Diss. 2011. Web. 15 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four to seven pollination groups in apples, depending on climate:
* Group A – Early flowering, 1 to 3 May in England ('[[Gravenstein]]', 'Red Astrachan')
* Group B – 4 to 7 May ('[[Idared]]', '[[McIntosh (apple)|McIntosh]]')
* Group C – Mid-season flowering, 8 to 11 May ('[[Granny Smith]]', '[[Cox's Orange Pippin]]')
* Group D – Mid/late season flowering, 12 to 15 May ('[[Golden Delicious]]', 'Calville blanc d'hiver')
* Group E – Late flowering, 16 to 18 May ('[[Braeburn]]', 'Reinette d'Orléans')
* Group F – 19 to 23 May ('Suntan')
* Group H – 24 to 28 May ('Court-Pendu Gris' – also called Court-Pendu plat)

One cultivar can be pollinated by a compatible cultivar from the same group or close (A with A, or A with B, but not A with C or D).&lt;ref name="Symposium on Growth Regulators in Fruit Production"/&gt;

Cultivars are sometimes classified by the day of peak bloom in the average 30-day blossom period, with pollenizers selected from cultivars within a 6-day overlap period.

===Maturation and harvest===
{{See also|Fruit picking|Fruit tree pruning}}

Cultivars vary in their yield and the ultimate size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock. Some cultivars, if left unpruned, will grow very large, which allows them to bear much more fruit, but makes harvesting very difficult. Depending on the tree density (number of trees planted per unit surface area), mature trees typically bear {{convert|40|-|200|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}} of apples each year, though productivity can be close to zero in poor years. Apples are harvested using three-point ladders that are designed to fit amongst the branches. Trees grafted on dwarfing rootstocks will bear about {{convert|10|-|80|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}} of fruit per year.&lt;ref name=app4/&gt;

Farms with apple orchards may open them to the public, so consumers may themselves pick the apples they will purchase.&lt;ref name=food/&gt;

Crops ripen at different times of the year according to the cultivar. Cultivar that yield their crop in the summer include 'Gala', 'Golden Supreme', 'McIntosh', 'Transparent', 'Primate', '[[Sweet Bough]]', and 'Duchess'; fall producers include 'Fuji', 'Jonagold', 'Golden Delicious', 'Red Delicious', 'Chenango', 'Gravenstein', 'Wealthy', 'McIntosh', 'Snow', and 'Blenheim'; winter producers include 'Winesap', 'Granny Smith', 'King', 'Wagener', '[[Swazie (apple)|Swayzie]]', 'Greening', and 'Tolman Sweet'.&lt;ref name="lawrence122"/&gt;

===Storage===
[[File:MIN Rungis pommes.jpg|thumb|Different kinds of apple [[List of apple cultivars|cultivars]] in a wholesale food market]]
Commercially, apples can be stored for some months in [[controlled atmosphere]] chambers to delay [[ethylene]]-induced ripening. Apples are commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations of [[carbon dioxide]] and high air filtration. This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and preventing ripening from occurring too quickly.

For home storage, most cultivars of apple can be held for approximately two weeks when kept at the coolest part of the refrigerator (i.e. below 5&amp;nbsp;°C).

===Pests and diseases===
[[File:Apple tree leaves with insect damage.jpg|thumb|Leaves with significant insect damage]]
{{Main|List of apple diseases}}
{{See also|List of Lepidoptera that feed on Malus}}
Apple trees are susceptible to a number of [[fungus|fungal]] and [[bacterium|bacterial]] diseases and insect pests. Many commercial orchards pursue a program of chemical sprays to maintain high fruit quality, tree health, and high yields. These prohibit the use of synthetic pesticides, though some older pesticides are allowed. [[organic farming|Organic]] methods include, for instance, introducing its natural predator to reduce the population of a particular pest.

A wide range of pests and diseases can affect the plant; three of the more common diseases/pests are mildew, aphids and apple scab.
* [[Mildew]]: which is characterized by light grey powdery patches appearing on the leaves, shoots and flowers, normally in spring. The flowers will turn a creamy yellow color and will not develop correctly. This can be treated in a manner not dissimilar from treating [[Botryotinia|Botrytis]]; eliminating the conditions which caused the disease in the first place and burning the infected plants are among the recommended actions to take.&lt;ref name="pest4"/&gt;
* [[Aphids]]: There are five species of aphids commonly found on apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species can be identified by their color, the time of year when they are present and by differences in the cornicles, which are small paired projections from the rear of aphids.&lt;ref name=pest4/&gt; Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.&lt;ref name=pest5&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umass.edu/fruitadvisor/NEAPMG/index.htm |title=Apple Pest Management Guide |author=Coli, William |accessdate=3 March 2008 |publisher=University of Massachusetts Amherst |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212130013/http://www.umass.edu/fruitadvisor/NEAPMG/index.htm |archivedate=12 February 2008 |deadurl=no|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Apple scab]]: Apple scab causes leaves to develop olive-brown spots with a velvety texture that later turn brown and become cork-like in texture. The disease also affects the fruit, which also develops similar brown spots with velvety or cork-like textures. Apple scab is spread through fungus growing in old apple leaves on the ground and spreads during warm spring weather to infect the new year's growth.&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;{{cite book |title=The Organic Gardener's Handbook of Natural Pest and Disease Control |editor1=Bradley, Fern Marshall |editor2=Ellis, Barbara W. |editor3=Martin, Deborah L. |year=2009 |publisher=Rodale, Inc |isbn=978-1-60529-677-7 |pages=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most serious disease problems are [[fireblight]], a bacterial disease; and ''[[Gymnosporangium]]'' rust, and [[Black Spot (disease)|black spot]], two fungal diseases.&lt;ref name=pest5/&gt; [[Codling moth]]s and [[apple maggot]]s are two other pests which affect apple trees. Young apple trees are also prone to mammal pests like mice and deer, which feed on the soft bark of the trees, especially in winter.&lt;ref name=Bradley/&gt; The larvae of the [[Synanthedon myopaeformis|apple clearwing moth (red-belted clearwing)]] burrow through the bark and into the phloem of apple trees, potentially causing significant damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erler|first=Fedai|date=2010-01-01|title=Efficacy of tree trunk coating materials in the control of the apple clearwing, Synanthedon myopaeformis|url=https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/10/1/63/845249|journal=Journal of Insect Science|volume=10|issue=1|pages=1|doi=10.1673/031.010.6301|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115060523/https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/10/1/63/845249|archivedate=15 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human consumption==
{{See also| Cooking apple|Cider apple}}
[[File:Apple stark s.jpg|thumb|An apple core, part of an apple not usually eaten, containing the seeds]]

All parts of the fruit, including the skin, except for the seeds, are suitable for human consumption. The core, from stem to bottom, containing the seeds, is usually not eaten and is discarded.

Apples can be consumed various ways: [[Apple juice|juice]], raw in salads, baked in [[Apple pie|pies]], cooked into [[Apple sauce|sauces]] and spreads like [[apple butter]], and other [[Cooking apple|baked dishes]].&lt;ref name=applefood/&gt;

Several techniques are used to preserve apples and apple products. Apples can be canned, dried or frozen.&lt;ref name=applefood/&gt; Canned or frozen apples are eventually baked into pies or other cooked dishes. Apple juice or cider is also bottled. Apple juice is often concentrated and frozen.

===Popular uses===
Apples are often eaten raw. Cultivars bred for raw consumption are termed dessert or [[table apple]]s.
* In the UK, a [[toffee apple]] is a traditional confection made by coating an apple in hot [[toffee]] and allowing it to cool. Similar treats in the U.S. are [[candy apple]]s (coated in a hard shell of crystallized sugar syrup), and [[caramel apples]] (coated with cooled [[caramel]]).
* Apples are eaten with honey at the Jewish New Year of [[Rosh Hashanah]] to symbolize a sweet new year.&lt;ref name=food/&gt;

Apples are an important ingredient in many desserts, such as [[apple pie]], apple [[crumble]], [[apple crisp]] and [[apple cake]]. When cooked, some apple cultivars easily form a puree known as [[apple sauce]]. Apples are also made into [[apple butter]] and apple jelly. They are often [[baked]] or [[stewed]] and are also (cooked) in some meat dishes. Dried apples can be eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid).

Apples are milled or pressed to produce [[apple juice]], which may be drunk unfiltered (called [[apple cider]] in North America), or filtered. Filtered juice is often concentrated and frozen to be reconstituted later and consumed. Apple juice can be [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] to make [[cider]] (called hard cider in North America), [[ciderkin]], and vinegar. Through [[distillation]], various alcoholic beverages can be produced, such as [[applejack (beverage)|applejack]], [[Calvados (spirit)|Calvados]], and [[apfelwein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Edible Medicinal And Non-Medicinal Plants: Volume 4, Fruits|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=9789400740532|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phytochemicals===
Apples are a rich source of various [[phytochemical]]s including [[flavonoid]]s (e.g., [[catechin]]s, [[flavanol]]s, and [[quercetin]]) and other [[Polyphenol|phenolic compounds]] (e.g., [[epicatechin]] and [[procyanidin]]s)&lt;ref name=Ribeiro2014&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ribeiro FA, Gomes de Moura CF, ((Aguiar O Jr)), de Oliveira F, Spadari RC, Oliveira NR, Oshima CT, Ribeiro DA |title=The chemopreventive activity of apple against carcinogenesis: antioxidant activity and cell cycle control |journal=European Journal of Cancer Prevention |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=477–80 |date=September 2014 |pmid=24366437 |doi=10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000005 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; found in the skin, core, and pulp of the apple;&lt;ref name=Ribeiro2014/&gt; they have unknown health value in humans.&lt;ref name=J1&gt;{{cite journal |title=Apple phytochemicals and their health benefits |journal=Nutrition journal |publisher=Department of Food Science and Institute of Comparative and Environmental Toxicology |location=Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853-7201 USA |date=May 2004 |url=http://www.nutritionj.com/content/3/1/5 |doi=10.1186/1475-2891-3-5 |volume=3 |page=5 |pmid=15140261 |last1=Boyer |first1=Jeanelle |last2=Liu |first2=RH |issue=1 |pmc=442131 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311132234/http://www.nutritionj.com/content/3/1/5 |archivedate=11 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phenolic compounds, such as polyphenol oxidase, are the main driving force behind browning in apples. Polyphenol oxidase catalyzes the reaction of phenolic compounds to o-quinones causing the pigment to turn darker and therefore brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sapers |first=Gerald M. |last2=Douglas |first2=Frederic W. |date=1 September 1987 |title=Measurement of Enzymatic Browning at Cut Surfaces and in Juice of Raw Apple and Pear Fruits |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.1987.tb14057.x/abstract |journal=Journal of Food Science |language=en |volume=52 |issue=5 |pages=1258–1285 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.1987.tb14057.x |issn=1750-3841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health effects===
Preliminary research is investigating whether nutrients and/or phytochemicals in apples may be preventive against the risk of some types of cancer.&lt;ref name=Ribeiro2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=18855307 |year=2008 |author1=Gerhauser |first1=C |title=Cancer chemopreventive potential of apples, apple juice, and apple components |journal=Planta Medica |volume=74 |issue=13 |pages=1608–24 |doi=10.1055/s-0028-1088300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allergy===
One form of apple allergy, often found in northern Europe, is called birch-apple syndrome, and is found in people who are also allergic to [[birch]] [[pollen]].&lt;ref name=EU/&gt; Allergic reactions are triggered by a protein in apples that is similar to birch pollen, and people affected by this protein can also develop allergies to other fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Reactions, which entail [[oral allergy syndrome]] (OAS), generally involve itching and inflammation of the mouth and throat,&lt;ref name=EU/&gt; but in rare cases can also include life-threatening [[anaphylaxis]].&lt;ref&gt;Landau, Elizabeth, [http://articles.cnn.com/2009-04-08/health/oral.allergy.syndrome_1_allergy-shots-pollen-allergies-oral-allergy-syndrome?_s=PM:HEALTH Oral allergy syndrome may explain mysterious reactions]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215000907/http://articles.cnn.com/2009-04-08/health/oral.allergy.syndrome_1_allergy-shots-pollen-allergies-oral-allergy-syndrome?_s=PM%3AHEALTH |date=15 December 2011 }}, 8 April 2009, ''CNN Health'', accessed 17 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This reaction only occurs when raw fruit is consumed—the allergen is neutralized in the cooking process. The variety of apple, maturity and storage conditions can change the amount of allergen present in individual fruits. Long storage times can increase the amount of proteins that cause birch-apple syndrome.&lt;ref name=EU&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foodallergens.ifr.ac.uk/food.lasso?selected_food=2#summary |title=General Information – Apple |publisher=Informall |accessdate=17 October 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723201454/http://foodallergens.ifr.ac.uk/food.lasso?selected_food=2 |archivedate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other areas, such as the Mediterranean, some individuals have adverse reactions to apples because of their similarity to peaches.&lt;ref name=EU/&gt; This form of apple allergy also includes OAS, but often has more severe symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain and [[urticaria]], and can be life-threatening. Individuals with this form of allergy can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts. Cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction, so affected individuals can eat neither raw nor cooked apples. Freshly harvested, over-ripe fruits tend to have the highest levels of the protein that causes this reaction.&lt;ref name=EU/&gt;

Breeding efforts have yet to produce a [[hypoallergenic]] fruit suitable for either of the two forms of apple allergy.&lt;ref name=EU/&gt;

===Toxicity of seeds===
The seeds of apples contain small amounts of [[amygdalin]], a sugar and [[cyanide]] compound known as a [[Cyanogenic glycoside#Cyanogenic glycosides|cyanogenic glycoside]]. Ingesting small amounts of apple seeds will cause no ill effects, but consumption of extremely large doses can cause [[adverse reaction]]s. It may take several hours before the poison takes effect, as cyanogenic glycosides must be [[hydrolyzed]] before the cyanide ion is released.&lt;ref name="NelsonShih2007"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lewis S.

==Proverbs==
The [[proverb]] "''[[An apple a day keeps the doctor away]]''", addressing the health effects of the fruit, dates from 19th century Wales, according to Caroline Taggart, author of "An Apple a Day: Old-Fashioned Proverbs and Why They Still Work". The original phrase, Taggart said, was: "Eat an apple on going to bed, and you'll keep the doctor from earning his bread". In the 19th century and early 20th, the phrase evolved to "an apple a day, no doctor to pay" and "an apple a day sends the doctor away", while the phrasing now commonly used was first recorded in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pollan |first=Michael |title=The Botany of Desire: a Plant's-eye View of the World |year=2001 |isbn=0375501290 |page=22, cf. p. 9 &amp; 50 |publisher=Random House |url=https://www.pbs.org/thebotanyofdesire/ |accessdate=3 January 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225121053/http://www.pbs.org/thebotanyofdesire/ |archivedate=25 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
