[[File:Iceberg with hole near Sandersons Hope 2007-07-28 2.jpg|thumb|Water in two states: liquid (including the clouds, which are examples of [[aerosol]]s), and solid ([[ice]]).]]

'''Water''' is a transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless [[chemical substance]], which is the main constituent of [[Earth]]'s streams, lakes, and oceans, and the [[fluid]]s of most living [[organism]]s. It is vital for all known forms of [[Life#Range of tolerance|life]], even though it provides no [[food energy|calories]] or [[organic compound|organic]] [[nutrient]]s. Its [[chemical formula]] is '''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''', meaning that each of its [[molecule]]s contains one [[oxygen]] and two [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s connected by [[covalent bond]]s. Water is the name of the liquid state of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O at [[standard ambient temperature and pressure]]. It forms [[precipitation]] in the form of [[rain]] and [[aerosol]]s in the form of [[fog]]. [[Cloud]]s  &lt;!-- The first word in a sentence is always capitalized in English. --&gt; are formed from suspended droplets of water and [[ice]], its solid state. When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of [[snow]]. The gaseous state of water is [[steam]] or [[water vapor]]. Water moves continually through the [[water cycle]] of [[evaporation]], [[transpiration]] ([[evapotranspiration]]), [[condensation]], [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], and [[Surface runoff|runoff]], usually reaching the sea.

Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface, mostly in seas and oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html#Geo |title=CIA – The world facctbook |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |accessdate=20 December 2008 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5nDzbMmsd?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html#Geo |archive-date=1 February 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small portions of water occur as groundwater (1.7%), in the glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland (1.7%), and in the [[atmosphere|air]] as [[vapor]], clouds (formed of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] (0.001%).&lt;ref name=b1&gt;{{cite book |title=Water in Crisis: A Guide to the World's Freshwater Resources |editor=Gleick, P.H. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |page=13, Table 2.1 "Water reserves on the earth" |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/EarthSciences/Oceanography/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195076288 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408091921/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/EarthSciences/Oceanography/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195076288 |archivedate=8 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html Water Vapor in the Climate System] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320034158/http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html |date=20 March 2007 }}, Special Report, [AGU], December 1995 (linked 4/2007).

Much of long-distance trade of [[commodity|commodities]] (such as oil and natural gas) and manufactured products is transported by boats through seas, rivers, lakes, and [[canal]]s. Large quantities of water, ice, and steam are used for [[cooling]] and heating, in industry and homes. Water is an excellent [[solvent]] for a wide variety of chemical substances; as such it is widely used in industrial processes, and in cooking and [[washing]]. Water is also central to many sports and other forms of entertainment, such as swimming, [[pleasure boat]]ing, [[boat racing]], [[surfing]], [[sport fishing]], and [[Underwater diving|diving]].

The word "water" comes from [[Old English]] "wæter", from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] "*watar" (source also of [[Old Saxon]] "watar", [[Old Frisian]] "wetir", [[Dutch language|Dutch]] "water", [[Old High German]] "wazzar", [[German language|German]] "Wasser", [[Old Norse]] "vatn", [[Gothic language|Gothic]] "wato"), from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indoeuropean]] "*wod-or", suffixed form of root "*wed-" ("water"; "wet").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=water |title=Water (v.) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.etymonline.com |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=20 May 2017 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802204905/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=water |archive-date=2 August 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SnowflakesWilsonBentley.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Snowflake]]s'' by [[Wilson Bentley]], 1902]]
[[File:Brindis (24675281395).jpg|thumb|left|Liquid water, showing droplets and air bubbles caused by the drops]]
Water is a liquid at the temperatures and pressures that are most adequate for life. Specifically, at a standard pressure of 1 [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]], water is a liquid between {{convert|0|and|100|C}}. Increasing the pressure slightly lowers the [[melting point]], which is about {{convert|-5|C}} at 600 atm and {{convert|-22|C}} at 2100 atm. This effect is relevant, for example, to [[ice skating]], to the [[Lake Vostok|buried lakes of Antarctica]], and to the movement of [[glacier]]s. (At pressures higher than 2100 atm the melting point rapidly increases again, and ice takes several exotic forms that do not exist at lower pressures.)

Increasing the pressure has a more dramatic effect on the [[boiling point]], that is about {{convert|374|C}} at 220 atm. This effect is important in, among other things, deep-sea [[hydrothermal vents]] and [[geyser]]s, [[pressure cooking]], and [[steam engine]] design. At the top of [[Mount Everest]], where the atmospheric pressure is about 0.34 atm, water boils at {{convert|68|C}}.

At very low pressures (below about 0.006 atm), water cannot exist in the liquid state and passes directly from solid to gas by [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]—a phenomenon exploited in the [[freeze drying]] of food. At very high pressures (above 221 atm), the liquid and gas states are no longer distinguishable, a state called [[supercritical fluid|supercritical steam]].

Water also differs from most liquids in that it becomes less [[density|dense]] as it freezes. The maximum density of water in its liquid form (at 1&amp;nbsp;atm) is {{convert|1000|kg/m3|lb/cuft|sigfig=4|abbr=on}}; that occurs at {{convert|3.98|°C}}.&lt;ref name="NatureWaterStructure"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.academia.edu/2230441/Water_Water_an_enduring_mystery |title=Water: Water—an enduring mystery |access-date=15 November 2016 |publisher=Nature |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117211552/http://www.academia.edu/2230441/Water_Water_an_enduring_mystery |archive-date=17 November 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The density of ice is {{convert|917|kg/m3|lb/cuft|sigfig=4|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kotz, J.C., Treichel, P., &amp; Weaver, G.C. |year=2005 |title=Chemistry &amp; Chemical Reactivity |publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |isbn=978-0-534-39597-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ben-Naim |first=Ariel |display-authors=etal |title=Alice's Adventures in Water-land |year=2011 |location=Singapore |doi=10.1142/8068 |last2=Ben-Naim |first2=Roberta |isbn=978-981-4338-96-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, water expands 9% in volume as it freezes, which accounts for the fact that ice floats on liquid water.

The details of the exact chemical nature of liquid water are not well understood; some theories suggest that water's unusual behaviour is as a result of it having 2 liquid states.&lt;ref name="NatureWaterStructure" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Maestro |first=L.M. |last2=Marqués |first2=M.I. |last3=Camarillo |first3=E. |last4=Jaque |first4=D. |last5=Solé |first5=J.

===Taste and odor===

Pure water is usually described as tasteless and odorless, although humans have specific sensors that can feel the presence of water in their mouths,&lt;ref name=emo&gt;Edmund T. Rolls (2005), "Emotion Explained". Oxford University Press, Medical. {{ISBN|0198570031}}, 9780198570035.&lt;/ref&gt; and frogs are known to be able to smell it.&lt;ref name=frog&gt;R. Llinas, W. Precht (2012), "Frog Neurobiology: A Handbook". Springer Science &amp; Business Media. {{ISBN|3642663168}}, 9783642663161&lt;/ref&gt; However, water from ordinary sources (including bottled mineral water) usually has many dissolved substances, that may give it varying tastes and odors. [[Humans]] and other animals have developed senses that enable them to evaluate the [[drinking water|potability]] of water by avoiding water that is too salty or [[putrid]].&lt;ref name=candau&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Candau |first1=Joël |year=2004 |title=The Olfactory Experience: constants and cultural variables |url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00130924 |journal=Water Science and Technology |volume=49 |issue=9 |pages=11–17 |access-date=28 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002152229/https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00130924 |archive-date=2 October 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Color and appearance===
The apparent color of natural bodies of water (and swimming pools) is often determined more by dissolved and suspended solids, or by reflection of the sky, than by water itself.

Light in the visible [[electromagnetic spectrum]] can traverse a couple meters of pure water (or ice) without significant [[optical absorption|absorption]], so that it looks [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] and colorless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Braun |first=Charles L. |author2=Sergei N. Smirnov |title=Why is water blue? |journal=J. Chem. Educ. |volume=70 |issue=8 |page=612 |year=1993 |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~etrnsfer/water.htm |doi=10.1021/ed070p612 |bibcode=1993JChEd..70..612B |access-date=21 April 2007 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66eKvCZUa?url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~etrnsfer/water.htm |archive-date=3 April 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus [[aquatic plant]]s, [[alga]]e, and other [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms can live in water up to hundreds of meters deep, because [[sunlight]] can reach them. Water vapour is essentially invisible as a gas.

Through a thickness of {{convert|10|m|sp=us}} or more, however, the intrinsic [[color of water]] (or ice) is visibly turquoise (greenish blue), as its [[electromagnetic absorption by water|absorption spectrum]] has a sharp minimum at the corresponding color of light (1/227 m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; at 418&amp;nbsp;nm). The color becomes increasingly stronger and darker with increasing thickness. (Practically no sunlight reaches the parts of the oceans below {{convert|1000|m|sp=us}} of depth.) Infrared and ultraviolet light, on the other hand, is strongly [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] by water.

The [[refraction index]] of liquid water (1.333 at {{convert|20|C}}) is much higher than that of air (1.0), similar to those of [[alkane]]s and [[ethanol]], but lower than those of [[glycerol]] (1.473), [[benzene]] (1.501), [[carbon disulfide]] (1.627), and common types of glass (1.4 to 1.6). The refraction index of ice (1.31) is lower than that of liquid water.

===Polarity and hydrogen bonding===
{{See also|Chemical bonding of H2O}}
[[File:3D model hydrogen bonds in water.svg|left|thumb|Model of [[hydrogen bond]]s (1) between molecules of water.]]
[[File:Capillarity.svg|upright|thumb|[[Capillary action]] of water compared to [[Mercury (element)|mercury]].]]
[[File:Water drop 001.jpg|right|thumb|Impact from a water drop causes an upward "rebound" jet surrounded by circular [[capillary wave]]s.]]

Since the water molecule is not linear and the oxygen atom has a higher [[electronegativity]] than hydrogen atoms, it is a [[polar molecule]], with an [[electrical dipole moment]]: the oxygen atom carries a slight negative charge, whereas the hydrogen atoms are slightly positive. Water is a good polar [[solvent]], that dissolves many [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] and [[hydrophilic]] organic molecules such as sugars and simple alcohols such as [[ethanol]]. Most [[acid]]s dissolve in water to yield the corresponding [[anion]]s. Many substances in living organisms, such as [[protein]]s, [[DNA]] and [[polysaccharide]]s, are dissolved in water. Water also dissolves many gases, such as oxygen and [[carbon dioxide]]—the latter giving the fizz of [[carbonation|carbonated]] beverages, [[sparkling wine]]s and beers.

On the other hand, many organic substances (such as [[lipids|fats and oils]] and [[alkanes]]) are [[hydrophobic]], that is, insoluble in water. Many inorganic substances are insoluble too, including most metal [[oxide]]s, [[sulfide]]s, and [[silicate]]s.

Because of its polarity, a molecule of water in the liquid or solid state can form up to four [[hydrogen bonds]] with neighboring molecules. These bonds are the cause of water's high [[surface tension]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. |author2=Brad Williamson |author3=Robin J. Heyden |title=Biology: Exploring Life |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2006 |location=Boston, Massachusetts |url=http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html |isbn=978-0-13-250882-7 |access-date=11 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102041816/http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html |archive-date=2 November 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and capillary forces. The [[capillary action]] refers to the tendency of water to move up a narrow tube against the force of [[gravity]]. This property is relied upon by all [[vascular plant]]s, such as trees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.jrank.org/pages/1182/Capillary-Action.html Capillary Action – Liquid, Water, Force, and Surface – JRank Articles] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527124752/http://science.jrank.org/pages/1182/Capillary-Action.html |date=27 May 2013 }}. Science.jrank.org. Retrieved on 28 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hydrogen bonds are also the reason why the melting and boiling points of water are much higher than those of [[Hydrogen chalcogenide|other analogous compounds]] like [[hydrogen sulfide]] ({{chem|H|2|S}}). They also explain its exceptionally high [[specific heat capacity]] (about 4.2 [[joule|J]]/g/K), [[heat of fusion]] (about 333 J/g), [[heat of vaporization]] ({{nowrap|2257 J/g}}), and [[thermal conductivity]] (between 0.561 and 0.679 W/m/K). These properties make water more effective at moderating Earth's [[climate]], by storing heat and transporting it between the oceans and the atmosphere. The hydrogen bonds of water are of moderate strength, around 23 kJ/mol (compared to a covalent O-H bond at 492 kJ/mol). Of this, it is estimated that 90% of the hydrogen bond is attributable to electrostatics, while the remaining 10% reflects partial covalent character.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1 March 2000|title=Compton scattering evidence for covalency of the hydrogen bond in ice|journal=Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids|volume=61|issue=3|pages=403–406|doi=10.1016/S0022-3697(99)00325-X|last1=Isaacs|first1=E.D|last2=Shukla|first2=A|last3=Platzman|first3=P.M|last4=Hamann|first4=D.R|last5=Barbiellini|first5=B|last6=Tulk|first6=C.A|bibcode=2000JPCS...61..403I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrical conductivity and electrolysis===
Pure water has a low [[electrical conductivity]], which increases with the [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] of a small amount of ionic material such as [[sodium chloride|common salt]].

Liquid water can be split into the [[chemical element|elements]] hydrogen and oxygen by passing an electric current through it—a process called [[electrolysis of water|electrolysis]]. The decomposition requires more energy input than the [[standard enthalpy of formation|heat released by the inverse process]] (285.8 kJ/[[mole (unit)|mol]], or 15.9 MJ/kg).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ball |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Ball |title=Burning water and other myths |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070910/full/070910-13.html |journal=News@nature |date=14 September 2007 |accessdate=14 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228054247/http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070910/full/070910-13.html |archive-date=28 February 2009 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all |doi=10.1038/news070910-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanical properties===

Liquid water can be assumed to be incompressible for most purposes: its compressibility ranges from 4.4 to {{val|5.1|e=-10|u=Pa&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} in ordinary conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fine, R.A. |author2=Millero, F.J.|last-author-amp=yes |date=1973 |title=Compressibility of water as a function of temperature and pressure |volume=59 |issue=10 |page=5529 |journal=Journal of Chemical Physics |doi=10.1063/1.1679903 |bibcode=1973JChPh..59.5529F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in oceans at 4&amp;nbsp;km depth, where the pressure is 400 atm, water suffers only a 1.8% decrease in volume.&lt;ref name=nave&gt;{{cite web |title=Bulk Elastic Properties |author=Nave, R. |website=HyperPhysics |publisher=[[Georgia State University]] |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hph.html |accessdate=26 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028155517/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hph.html |archive-date=28 October 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[viscosity]] of water is about 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; Pa·[[second|s]] or 0.01 [[Poise (unit)|poise]] at {{convert|20|C}}, and the [[speed of sound]] in liquid water ranges between {{convert|1400|and|1540|m/s|sp=us}} depending on temperature. Sound travels long distances in water with little attenuation, especially at low frequencies (roughly 0.03 [[decibel|dB]]/km for 1 k[[hertz|Hz]]), a property that is exploited by [[cetaceans]] and humans for communication and environment sensing ([[sonar]]).&lt;ref name=NPLcalc&gt;UK National Physical Laboratory, [http://resource.npl.co.uk/acoustics/techguides/seaabsorption/ Calculation of absorption of sound in seawater] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003014920/http://resource.npl.co.uk/acoustics/techguides/seaabsorption/ |date=3 October 2016 }}.

===Reactivity===
Metallic elements which are more [[electropositivity|electropositive]] than hydrogen such as [[lithium]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[potassium]] and [[caesium]] displace hydrogen from water, forming [[hydroxide]]s and releasing hydrogen. At high temperatures, carbon reacts with steam to form [[carbon monoxide]].

&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Water Distribution.jpg|thumb|Graphical illustration of the Earth's relative water distribution at various locations on or near its surface&lt;ref name="Garrison"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tom Garrison |title=Oceanography: An Invitation to Marine Science (7th Edition) |publisher=Yolanda Cossio |year=2009 |page= |isbn=978-0-495-39193-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface; the oceans contain 96.5% of the Earth's water. The [[Antarctic ice sheet]], which contains 61% of all fresh water on Earth, is visible at the bottom. Condensed atmospheric water can be seen as clouds, contributing to the Earth's [[albedo]].]]

Hydrology is the study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water throughout the Earth. The study of the distribution of water is [[hydrography]]. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is [[hydrogeology]], of glaciers is [[glaciology]], of inland waters is [[limnology]] and distribution of oceans is [[oceanography]]. Ecological processes with hydrology are in focus of [[ecohydrology]].

The collective mass of water found on, under, and over the surface of a planet is called the [[hydrosphere]]. Earth's approximate water volume (the total water supply of the world) is {{convert|1.338|e9km3|e6mi3|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=b1 /&gt;

Liquid water is found in [[body of water|bodies of water]], such as an ocean, sea, lake, river, stream, [[canal]], pond, or [[puddle]]. The majority of water on Earth is [[sea water]]. Water is also present in the atmosphere in solid, liquid, and vapor states. It also exists as groundwater in [[aquifer]]s.

Water is important in many geological processes. Groundwater is present in most [[rock (geology)|rocks]], and the pressure of this groundwater affects patterns of [[fault (geology)|faulting]]. Water in the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] is responsible for the melt that produces [[volcano]]es at [[subduction zone]]s. On the surface of the Earth, water is important in both chemical and physical [[weathering]] processes. Water, and to a lesser but still significant extent, ice, are also responsible for a large amount of [[sediment transport]] that occurs on the surface of the earth. [[Deposition (geology)|Deposition]] of transported sediment forms many types of [[sedimentary rock]]s, which make up the [[geologic record]] of [[History of the Earth|Earth history]].

===Water cycle===
{{Main|Water cycle}}
[[File:Water cycle.png|thumb|[[Water cycle]]]]

The [[water cycle]] (known scientifically as the hydrologic cycle) refers to the continuous exchange of water within the [[hydrosphere]], between the [[Earth atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[soil]] water, [[surface water]], [[groundwater]], and plants.

Water moves perpetually through each of these regions in the ''water cycle'' consisting of following transfer processes:
* [[evaporation]] from oceans and other water bodies into the air and [[transpiration]] from land plants and animals into air.
* [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], from water vapor condensing from the air and falling to earth or ocean.
* [[runoff (water)|runoff]] from the land usually reaching the sea.
Most water vapor over the oceans returns to the oceans, but winds carry water vapor over land at the same rate as runoff into the sea, about 47&amp;nbsp;[[Metric tonne unit|Tt]] per year. Over land, evaporation and transpiration contribute another 72&amp;nbsp;Tt per year. Precipitation, at a rate of 119 Tt per year over land, has several forms: most commonly rain, snow, and [[hail]], with some contribution from [[fog]] and [[dew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Water in Crisis: A Guide to the World's Freshwater Resources |editor=Gleick, P.H. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |page=15, Table 2.3 |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/EarthSciences/Oceanography/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195076288 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408091921/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/EarthSciences/Oceanography/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195076288 |archivedate=8 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dew is small drops of water that are condensed when a high density of water vapor meets a cool surface. Dew usually forms in the morning when the temperature is the lowest, just before sunrise and when the temperature of the earth's surface starts to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alice's Adventures in Water-land |author1=Ben-Naim, A. |author2=Ben-Naim, R., P.H. |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=World Scientific Publishing |year=2011 |page=31 |doi=10.1142/8068 |isbn=978-981-4338-96-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Condensed water in the air may also [[refract]] [[sunlight]] to produce [[rainbow]]s.

Water runoff often collects over [[Drainage basin|watersheds]] flowing into rivers. A mathematical model used to simulate river or stream flow and calculate water quality parameters is a [[hydrological transport model]]. Some water is diverted to [[irrigation]] for agriculture. Rivers and seas offer opportunity for travel and commerce. Through [[erosion]], runoff shapes the environment creating river [[valley]]s and [[river delta|deltas]] which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers. A flood occurs when an area of land, usually low-lying, is covered with water. It is when a river overflows its banks or flood comes from the sea. A drought is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply. This occurs when a region receives consistently below average precipitation.

===Fresh water storage===
{{Main|Water resources}}
{{multiple image|perrow = 1|total_width=150
| image1 = Bay of Fundy High Tide.jpg  |width1=|height1=
| image2 = Bay of Fundy Low Tide.jpg |width2=|height2=
| footer = The [[Bay of Fundy]] at high tide (left) and low tide (right)}}
Some runoff water is trapped for periods of time, for example in lakes. At high altitude, during winter, and in the far north and south, snow collects in ice caps, snow packs and glaciers. Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], or more spectacularly in [[hot spring]]s and [[geyser]]s. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in [[water well|wells]]. This water storage is important, since clean, fresh water is essential to human and other land-based life. In many parts of the world, it is in short supply.

===Sea water and tides===
{{Main|Seawater|Tides}}
[[Seawater|Sea water]] contains about 3.5% [[sodium chloride]] on average, plus smaller amounts of other substances. The physical properties of sea water differ from fresh water in some important respects. It freezes at a lower temperature (about {{convert|-1.9|C}}) and its density increases with decreasing temperature to the freezing point, instead of reaching maximum density at a temperature above freezing. The salinity of water in major seas varies from about 0.7% in the [[Baltic Sea]] to 4.0% in the [[Red Sea]]. (The [[Dead Sea]], known for its ultra-high salinity levels of between 30–40%, is really a [[salt lake]].)

[[Tide]]s are the cyclic rising and falling of local sea levels caused by the [[tidal force]]s of the Moon and the Sun acting on the oceans. Tides cause changes in the depth of the marine and [[estuary|estuarine]] water bodies and produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams. The changing tide produced at a given location is the result of the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth coupled with the [[Coriolis effect|effects of Earth rotation]] and the local [[bathymetry]]. The strip of seashore that is submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide, the [[intertidal zone]], is an important ecological product of ocean tides.

==Effects on life==
[[File:Oasis in Lybia.JPG|thumb|left|An [[oasis]] is an isolated [[water source]] with vegetation in a [[desert]].]]
[[File:Auto-and heterotrophs.svg|thumb|right|Overview of [[photosynthesis|&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;photosynthesis&lt;/span&gt;]] and [[cellular respiration|&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;respiration&lt;/span&gt;]]. Water (at right), together with carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), form oxygen and organic compounds (at left), which can be respired to water and (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).]]

From a [[biology|biological]] standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life. It carries out this role by allowing [[organic compound]]s to react in ways that ultimately allow [[Self-replication|replication]]. All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a [[solvent]] in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes within the body. Metabolism is the sum total of [[anabolism]] and [[catabolism]]. In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g. starches, triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information). In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes). Without water, these particular metabolic processes could not exist.

Water is fundamental to photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off water's hydrogen from oxygen{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}. Hydrogen is combined with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}. All living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun's energy and reform water and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the process (cellular respiration).

Water is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. An acid, a hydrogen ion (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as a hydroxide ion (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) to form water. Water is considered to be neutral, with a [[pH]] (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7. [[Acids]] have pH values less than 7 while [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] have values greater than 7.

===Aquatic life forms===
{{Further|Hydrobiology|Marine life|Aquatic plant}}
[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|thumb|upright|Some of the [[biodiversity]] of a [[coral reef]]]]
[[File:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg|thumb|Some marine [[diatom]]s – a key [[phytoplankton]] group]]
Earth surface waters are filled with life. The earliest life forms appeared in water; nearly all fish live exclusively in water, and there are many types of marine mammals, such as dolphins and whales. Some kinds of animals, such as [[amphibian]]s, spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Plants such as [[kelp]] and [[algae]] grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. [[Plankton]] is generally the foundation of the ocean [[food chain]].

Aquatic vertebrates must obtain oxygen to survive, and they do so in various ways. Fish have [[gills]] instead of [[lungs]], although some species of fish, such as the [[lungfish]], have both. [[Marine mammal]]s, such as dolphins, whales, [[otter]]s, and [[pinniped|seals]] need to surface periodically to breathe air. Some amphibians are able to absorb oxygen through their skin. Invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters including breathing tubes (see [[Siphon (insect)|insect]] and [[Siphon (mollusc)|mollusc siphons]]) and [[gills]] (''[[Carcinus]]''). However as invertebrate life evolved in an aquatic habitat most have little or no specialisation for respiration in water.

==Effects on human civilization==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2018}}
[[File:Longwood Gardens-Italian Garden.jpg|thumb|right|Water [[fountain]]]]

Civilization has historically flourished around rivers and major waterways; [[Mesopotamia]], the so-called cradle of civilization, was situated between the major rivers [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]; the ancient society of the [[Egyptians]] depended entirely upon the [[Nile]]. Rome was also founded on the banks of the Italian river [[Tiber]]. Large [[metropolis]]es like [[Rotterdam]], London, Montreal, Paris, New York City, [[Buenos Aires]], Shanghai, Tokyo, Chicago, and Hong Kong owe their success in part to their easy accessibility via water and the resultant expansion of trade. Islands with safe water ports, like Singapore, have flourished for the same reason. In places such as North Africa and the Middle East, where water is more scarce, access to clean drinking water was and is a major factor in human development.

===Health and pollution===
[[File:Field Trip- water sampling.jpg|thumb|An environmental science program – a student from [[Iowa State University]] sampling water]]
Water fit for human consumption is called drinking water or [[potable water]]. Water that is not potable may be made potable by filtration or [[distillation]], or by a range of [[Water treatment|other methods]].

Water that is not fit for drinking but is not harmful for humans when used for swimming or bathing is called by various names other than potable or drinking water, and is sometimes called [[safe water]], or "safe for bathing". Chlorine is a skin and mucous membrane irritant that is used to make water safe for bathing or drinking. Its use is highly technical and is usually monitored by government regulations (typically 1 part per million (ppm) for drinking water, and 1–2 ppm of chlorine not yet reacted with impurities for bathing water). Water for bathing may be maintained in satisfactory microbiological condition using chemical disinfectants such as [[chlorine]] or [[ozone]] or by the use of [[ultraviolet]] light.

In the US, non-potable forms of [[wastewater]] generated by humans may be referred to as [[greywater]], which is treatable and thus easily able to be made potable again, and [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]], which generally contains [[sewage]] and other forms of waste which require [[Sewage treatment|further treatment]] in order to be made reusable. Greywater composes 50–80% of residential wastewater generated by a household's sanitation equipment ([[sink]]s, showers and kitchen runoff, but not toilets, which generate blackwater.) These terms may have different meanings in other countries and cultures.

This natural resource is becoming scarcer in certain places, and its availability is a major social and economic concern. Currently, about a billion people around the world routinely drink unhealthy water. Most countries accepted the goal of halving by 2015 the number of people worldwide who do not have access to safe water and [[sanitation]] during the [[29th G8 summit|2003 G8 Evian summit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.g8.fr/evian/english/navigation/2003_g8_summit/summit_documents/water_-_a_g8_action_plan.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030608042310/http://www.g8.fr/evian/english/navigation/2003_g8_summit/summit_documents/water_-_a_g8_action_plan.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 June 2003 |title=G8 "Action plan" decided upon at the 2003 Evian summit |publisher=G8.fr |date=2 June 2003 |accessdate=25 July 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if this difficult goal is met, it will still leave more than an estimated half a billion people without access to safe drinking water and over a billion without access to adequate sanitation. Poor [[water quality]] and bad sanitation are deadly; some five million deaths a year are caused by polluted drinking water. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that [[safe water]] could prevent 1.4 million child deaths from [[diarrhea]] each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/features/qa/70/en/ |title=World Health Organization. Safe Water and Global Health |publisher=Who.int |date=25 June 2008 |accessdate=25 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224174349/http://www.who.int/features/qa/70/en/ |archive-date=24 December 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water, however, is not a finite resource (meaning the availability of water is limited), but rather re-circulated as potable water in precipitation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pba6tmIfiPgC&amp;pg=PA1815 |title=The Water Footprint of Modern Consumer Society |last=Hoekstra |first=Arjen Y. |date=19 June 2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1136457043 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in quantities many orders of magnitude higher than human consumption. Therefore, it is the relatively small quantity of water in reserve in the earth (about 1% of our drinking [[water supply]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} which is replenished in aquifers around every 1 to 10 years),{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} that is a [[non-renewable resource]], and it is, rather, the distribution of potable and irrigation water which is scarce,{{clarify |date=January 2017 |reason= distribution can not be scarce, can be lacking, or inefficient, or unjust, or unfair}} rather than the actual amount of it that exists on the earth. Water-poor countries use importation of goods as the primary method of importing water (to leave enough for local human consumption),{{Elucidate|date=January 2017 |reason=water importation, via products? unclear for regular reader}} since the manufacturing process{{clarify |date=January 2017 |reason= which manufacturing process?}} uses around 10 to 100 times products' masses in water.{{clarify |date=January 2017 |reason= this whole paragraph needs amendment}}

In the developing world, 90% of all [[wastewater]] still goes untreated into local rivers and streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Environmentally Sound Technology for Wastewater and Stormwater Management: An International Source Book |author=UNEP International Environment |year=2002 |publisher=IWA Publishing |isbn=978-1-84339-008-4 |oclc=49204666}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 50 countries, with roughly a third of the world's population, also suffer from medium or high water stress, and 17 of these extract more water annually than is recharged through their natural water cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Climate Change and Developing Countries |last=Ravindranath |first=Nijavalli H. |author2=Jayant A. Sathaye |year=2002 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4020-0104-8 |oclc=231965991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strain not only affects surface freshwater bodies like rivers and lakes, but it also degrades groundwater resources.

====Agriculture====
[[File:Subsurface drip emission on loamy soil.ogv|thumb|Water distribution in subsurface [[drip irrigation]]]]
[[File:SiphonTubes.JPG|thumb|right|[[Irrigation]] of field crops]]

The most important use of water in agriculture is for [[irrigation]], which is a key component to produce enough food. Irrigation takes up to 90% of water withdrawn in some developing countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&amp;id=MTYyNTA|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301011840/http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&amp;id=MTYyNTA|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 March 2012 |title=WBCSD Water Facts &amp; Trends |accessdate=25 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and significant proportions in more economically developed countries (in the United States, 30% of freshwater usage is for irrigation).&lt;ref name="Water Use in the United States"&gt;[http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/water/a_wateruse.html Water Use in the United States], National Atlas.gov  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814045418/http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/water/a_wateruse.html |date=14 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifty years ago, the common perception was that water was an infinite resource. At the time, there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet. People were not as wealthy as today, consumed fewer calories and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for the fixed amount of water resources is much more intense, giving rise to the concept of [[peak water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gleick |first=P.H. |title=Peak Water |url=http://www.pacinst.org/press_center/press_releases/peak_water_pnas.pdf |accessdate=11 October 2011 |year=2010 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1004812107 |pmid=20498082 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=107 |issue=125 |pages=11155–11162 |last2=Palaniappan |first2=M. |bibcode=2010PNAS..10711155G |pmc=2895062 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108224340/http://www.pacinst.org/press_center/press_releases/peak_water_pnas.pdf |archive-date=8 November 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because there are now nearly seven billion people on the planet, their consumption of water-thirsty meat and vegetables is rising, and there is increasing competition for water from industry, urbanisation and biofuel crops. In future, even more water will be needed to produce food because the Earth's population is forecast to rise to 9 billion by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Press Release POP/952 (13 March 2007). [https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/pop952.doc.htm World population will increase by 2.5 billion by 2050] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727030018/http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/pop952.doc.htm |date=27 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An assessment of water management in agriculture was conducted in 2007 by the [[International Water Management Institute]] in Sri Lanka to see if the world had sufficient water to provide food for its growing population.&lt;ref&gt;Molden, D. (Ed). ''Water for food, Water for life: [[A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture]].'' Earthscan/IWMI, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It assessed the current availability of water for agriculture on a global scale and mapped out locations suffering from water scarcity. It found that a fifth of the world's people, more than 1.2 billion, live in areas of [[physical water scarcity]], where there is not enough water to meet all demands. A further 1.6 billion people live in areas experiencing [[economic water scarcity]], where the lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity make it impossible for authorities to satisfy the demand for water. The report found that it would be possible to produce the food required in future, but that continuation of today's food production and environmental trends would lead to crises in many parts of the world. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Chartres, C. and Varma, S. (2010) ''Out of water. From Abundance to Scarcity and How to Solve the World's Water Problems''. FT Press (US).&lt;/ref&gt;

Water scarcity is also caused by production of [[cotton]]: 1&amp;nbsp;kg of cotton—equivalent of a pair of jeans—requires {{convert|10.9|m3|sp=us}} water to produce. While cotton accounts for 2.4% of world water use, the water is consumed in regions which are already at a risk of water shortage. Significant environmental damage has been caused, such as disappearance of the [[Aral Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Report18.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====As a scientific standard====
On 7 April 1795, the gram was defined in France to be equal to "the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to a cube of one hundredth of a meter, and at the temperature of melting ice".&lt;ref&gt;[http://smdsi.quartier-rural.org/histoire/18germ_3.htm Décret relatif aux poids et aux mesures. 18 germinal an 3 (7 April 1795)] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GVoZd4lp?url=http://smdsi.quartier-rural.org/histoire/18germ_3.htm |date=10 May 2013 }}. Decree relating to the weights and measurements (in French). quartier-rural.org&lt;/ref&gt; For practical purposes though, a metallic reference standard was required, one thousand times more massive, the kilogram. Work was therefore commissioned to determine precisely the mass of one liter of water. In spite of the fact that the decreed definition of the gram specified water at {{convert|0|C}}—a highly reproducible ''temperature''—the scientists chose to redefine the standard and to perform their measurements at the temperature of highest water ''density'', which was measured at the time as {{convert|4|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://histoire.du.metre.free.fr/fr/index.htm here L'Histoire Du Mètre, La Détermination De L'Unité De Poids] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GVoqCdnw?url=http://histoire.du.metre.free.fr/fr/index.htm |date=10 May 2013 }}. histoire.du.metre.free.fr&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kelvin temperature scale]] of the [[International System of Units|SI]] system is based on the [[triple point]] of water, defined as exactly {{convert|273.16|K|C F}}. The scale is an [[absolute temperature]] scale with the same increment as the Celsius temperature scale, which was originally defined according to the [[boiling point]] (set to {{convert|100|C}}) and [[melting point]] (set to {{convert|0|C}}) of water.

Natural water consists mainly of the isotopes hydrogen-1 and oxygen-16, but there is also a small quantity of heavier isotopes such as hydrogen-2 ([[deuterium]]). The amount of deuterium oxides or [[heavy water]] is very small, but it still affects the properties of water. Water from rivers and lakes tends to contain less deuterium than seawater. Therefore, standard water is defined in the [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]] specification.

The [[human body]] contains from 55% to 78% water, depending on body size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/2000-05/958588306.An.r.html Re: What percentage of the human body is composed of water?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071125073713/http://madsci.org/posts/archives/2000-05/958588306.An.r.html |date=25 November 2007 }} Jeffrey Utz, M.D., The MadSci Network&lt;/ref&gt; To function properly, the body requires between {{convert|1|and|7|L|sp=us|spell=in}} of water per day to avoid [[dehydration]]; the precise amount depends on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors.

For those who have healthy kidneys, it is rather difficult to drink too much water, but (especially in warm humid weather and while exercising) it is dangerous to drink too little.

An original recommendation for water intake in 1945 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the [[United States National Research Council]] read: "An ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food. Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Sciences. Recommended Dietary Allowances |publisher=National Research Council, Reprint and Circular Series, No. 122 |year=1945 |pages=3–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest dietary reference intake report by the [[United States National Research Council]] in general recommended, based on the median total water intake from US survey data (including food sources): {{convert|3.7|L|sp=us}} for men and {{convert|2.7|L|sp=us}} of water total for women, noting that water contained in food provided approximately 19% of total water intake in the survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/10925/chapter/6|title=4 Water {{!}} Dietary Reference Intakes for Water, Potassium, Sodium, Chloride, and Sulfate {{!}} The National Academies Press|doi=10.17226/10925|year=2005|isbn=978-0-309-09169-5|last1=Medicine|first1=Institute of|last2=Board|first2=Food Nutrition|last3=Intakes|first3=Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference|last4=Water|first4=Panel on Dietary Reference Intakes for Electrolytes and|access-date=11 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113063638/https://www.nap.edu/read/10925/chapter/6|archive-date=13 January 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, pregnant and [[breastfeeding]] women need additional fluids to stay hydrated. The [[Institute of Medicine]] (US) recommends that, on average, men consume {{convert|3|L|sp=us}} and women {{convert|2.2|L|sp=us}}; pregnant women should increase intake to {{convert|2.4|L|sp=us}} and breastfeeding women should get 3 liters (12 cups), since an especially large amount of fluid is lost during nursing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/water/NU00283 |title=Water: How much should you drink every day? |publisher=Mayoclinic.com |accessdate=25 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204012725/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/water/NU00283 |archive-date=4 December 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also noted is that normally, about 20% of water intake comes from food, while the rest comes from drinking water and beverages ([[Caffeine|caffeinated]] included). Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; through [[urine]] and [[feces]], through [[sweat]]ing, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath. With physical exertion and heat exposure, water loss will increase and daily fluid needs may increase as well.

Humans require water with few impurities. Common impurities include metal salts and oxides, including copper, iron, calcium and lead,&lt;ref&gt;''Conquering Chemistry'' 4th Ed. Published 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and/or harmful bacteria, such as ''[[Vibrio]]''. Some [[Solution|solutes]] are acceptable and even desirable for taste enhancement and to provide needed [[electrolyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maton |first=Anthea |author2=Jean Hopkins |author3=Charles William McLaughlin |author4=Susan Johnson |author5=Maryanna Quon Warner |author6=David LaHart |author7=Jill D.

The single largest (by volume) freshwater resource suitable for drinking is [[Lake Baikal]] in Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1cV8tziHZ5sC&amp;pg=PA125 |page=125 |title=Water: a shared responsibility |author=Unesco |publisher=Berghahn Books |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-84545-177-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Washing====
The propensity of water to form [[Solvation|solutions]] and [[emulsion]]s is useful in various [[washing]] processes. Washing is also an important component of several aspects of personal [[body hygiene]]. Most of personal water use is due to [[shower]]ing, doing the [[laundry]] and [[dishwashing]], reaching hundreds of liters per day in developed countries.

====Transportation====
{{Main|Ship transport}}
The use of water for transportation of materials through rivers and canals as well as the international shipping lanes is an important part of the world economy.

====Chemical uses====
Water is widely used in chemical reactions as a [[solvent]] or [[reactant]] and less commonly as a [[solution|solute]] or [[catalyst]]. In inorganic reactions, water is a common solvent, dissolving many ionic compounds, as well as other polar compounds such as [[ammonia]] and [[Hydrogen chalcogenide|compounds closely related to water]]. In organic reactions, it is not usually used as a reaction solvent, because it does not dissolve the reactants well and is [[amphoteric]] (acidic ''and'' basic) and [[nucleophilic]]. Nevertheless, these properties are sometimes desirable. Also, acceleration of [[Diels-Alder reaction]]s by water has been observed. [[Supercritical water]] has recently been a topic of research. Oxygen-saturated supercritical water combusts organic pollutants efficiently. Water vapor is used for some processes in the chemical industry. An example is the production of acrylic acid from acrolein, propylene and propane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The reaction network in propane oxidation over phase-pure MoVTeNb M1 oxide catalysts|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=2014|volume=311|pages=369–385|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2013.12.008|last1=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first1=Raoul|last2=Csepei|first2=Lénárd-István|last3=Hävecker|first3=Michael|last4=Girgsdies|first4=Frank|last5=Schuster|first5=Manfred E|last6=Schlögl|first6=Robert|last7=Trunschke|first7=Annette|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0014-F434-5|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215104605/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf|archive-date=15 February 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Surface chemistry of phase-pure M1 MoVTeNb oxide during operation in selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=2012|volume=285|pages=48–60|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2011.09.012|last1=Hävecker|first1=Michael|last2=Wrabetz|first2=Sabine|last3=Kröhnert|first3=Jutta|last4=Csepei|first4=Lenard-Istvan|last5=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first5=Raoul|last6=Kolen'Ko|first6=Yury V|last7=Girgsdies|first7=Frank|last8=Schlögl|first8=Robert|last9=Trunschke|first9=Annette|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0012-1BEB-F|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030003154/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf|archive-date=30 October 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kinetic studies of propane oxidation on Mo and V based mixed oxide catalysts|date=2011|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1199619:5/component/escidoc:1199618/csepei_lenard.pdf|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220044522/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1199619:5/component/escidoc:1199618/csepei_lenard.pdf|archive-date=20 December 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Multifunctionality of Crystalline MoV(TeNb) M1 Oxide Catalysts in Selective Oxidation of Propane and Benzyl Alcohol|journal=ACS Catalysis|date=2013|volume=3|issue=6|pages=1103–1113|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278196177|doi=10.1021/cs400010q|last1=Amakawa|first1=Kazuhiko|last2=Kolen'Ko|first2=Yury V|last3=Villa|first3=Alberto|last4=Schuster|first4=Manfred E/|last5=Csepei|first5=Lénárd-István|last6=Weinberg|first6=Gisela|last7=Wrabetz|first7=Sabine|last8=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first8=Raoul|last9=Girgsdies|first9=Frank|last10=Prati|first10=Laura|last11=Schlögl|first11=Robert|last12=Trunschke|first12=Annette}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possible effect of water in these reactions includes the physical-, chemical interaction of water with the catalyst and the chemical reaction of water with the reaction intermediates.

====Heat exchange====
Water and steam are a common fluid used for [[heat exchanger|heat exchange]], due to its availability and high [[Heat capacity of water|heat capacity]], both for cooling and heating. Cool water may even be naturally available from a lake or the sea. It's especially effective to transport heat through [[vaporization]] and [[condensation]] of water because of its large [[latent heat of vaporization]]. A disadvantage is that metals commonly found in industries such as steel and copper are [[oxidation|oxidized]] faster by untreated water and steam. In almost all [[thermal power station]]s, water is used as the working fluid (used in a closed loop between boiler, steam turbine and condenser), and the coolant (used to exchange the waste heat to a water body or carry it away by [[evaporation]] in a [[cooling tower]]). In the United States, cooling power plants is the largest use of water.&lt;ref name="Water Use in the United States" /&gt;

In the [[nuclear power]] industry, water can also be used as a [[neutron moderator]]. In most [[nuclear reactor]]s, water is both a coolant and a moderator. This provides something of a passive safety measure, as removing the water from the reactor also [[void coefficient|slows the nuclear reaction down]]. However other methods are favored for stopping a reaction and it is preferred to keep the nuclear core covered with water so as to ensure adequate cooling.

====Fire extinction====
[[File:MH-60S Helicopter dumps water onto Fire.jpg|right|thumb|Water is used for [[fire fighting|fighting]] [[wildfire]]s.]]
Water has a high heat of vaporization and is relatively inert, which makes it a good [[Fire fighting#Use of water|fire extinguishing]] fluid. The evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire. It is dangerous to use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents, because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the burning liquid.

Use of water in fire fighting should also take into account the hazards of a [[steam explosion]], which may occur when water is used on very hot fires in confined spaces, and of a hydrogen explosion, when substances which react with water, such as certain metals or hot carbon such as coal, [[charcoal]], or [[coke (fuel)|coke]] graphite, decompose the water, producing [[water gas]].

The power of such explosions was seen in the [[Chernobyl disaster]], although the water involved did not come from fire-fighting at that time but the reactor's own water cooling system. A steam explosion occurred when the extreme overheating of the core caused water to flash into steam. A hydrogen explosion may have occurred as a result of reaction between steam and hot [[zirconium]].

====Recreation====
{{Main|Water sport (recreation)}}
[[File:Grand Anse Beach Grenada.jpg|thumb|right|Grand Anse Beach, St. George's, [[Grenada]], [[West Indies]]]]

Humans use water for many recreational purposes, as well as for exercising and for sports. Some of these include swimming, [[waterskiing]], [[boating]], [[surfing]] and [[Underwater diving|diving]]. In addition, some sports, like [[ice hockey]] and [[ice skating]], are played on ice. Lakesides, beaches and [[water park]]s are popular places for people to go to relax and enjoy recreation. Many find the sound and appearance of flowing water to be calming, and fountains and other water features are popular decorations. Some keep fish and other life in [[aquarium]]s or ponds for show, fun, and companionship. Humans also use water for snow sports i.e. [[skiing]], [[sledding]], [[snowmobiling]] or [[snowboarding]], which require the water to be frozen.

====Water industry====
[[File:Water carrier in India.jpg|thumb|upright|A water-carrier in India, 1882. In many places where running water is not available, water has to be transported by people.]]
[[File:TapWater-china.JPG|thumb|A manual water [[pump]] in China]]

[[File:Reverse osmosis desalination plant.JPG|thumb|[[Reverse osmosis]] (RO) [[desalination]] plant in [[Barcelona]], Spain]]

The [[water industry]] provides drinking water and [[wastewater]] services (including [[sewage treatment]]) to households and industry. [[Water supply]] facilities include [[water well]]s, [[cistern]]s for [[rainwater harvesting]], [[water supply network]]s, and [[water purification]] facilities, [[water tank]]s, [[water tower]]s, [[water pipe]]s including old [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]]. [[Atmospheric water generator]]s are in development.

Drinking water is often collected at [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], extracted from artificial [[Boring (earth)|borings]] (wells) in the ground, or pumped from lakes and rivers. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water, assuming the aquifers can supply an adequate flow. Other water sources include rainwater collection. Water may require purification for human consumption. This may involve removal of undissolved substances, dissolved substances and harmful [[microbe]]s. Popular methods are [[filter (water)|filtering]] with sand which only removes undissolved material, while [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] and [[boiling]] kill harmful microbes. [[Distillation]] does all three functions. More advanced techniques exist, such as [[reverse osmosis]]. [[Desalination]] of abundant [[seawater]] is a more expensive solution used in coastal [[arid]] [[climate]]s.

The distribution of drinking water is done through [[municipal water system]]s, tanker delivery or as [[bottled water]]. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge.

Reducing usage by using drinking (potable) water only for human consumption is another option. In some cities such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to [[Water conservation|conserve fresh water resources]].

[[Water pollution|Polluting water]] may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter. Like other types of pollution, this does not enter standard accounting of market costs, being conceived as [[externality|externalities]] for which the market cannot account. Thus other people pay the price of water pollution, while the private firms' profits are not redistributed to the local population, victims of this pollution. [[Pharmaceuticals]] consumed by humans often end up in the waterways and can have detrimental effects on [[marine biology|aquatic]] life if they [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] and if they are not [[biodegradable]].

Municipal and industrial wastewater are typically treated at [[wastewater treatment plant]]s. Mitigation of polluted [[surface runoff]] is addressed through a variety of prevention and treatment techniques. (''See'' [[Surface runoff#Mitigation and treatment]].)

====Industrial applications====
Many industrial processes rely on reactions using chemicals dissolved in water, suspension of solids in water [[slurry|slurries]] or using water to dissolve and extract substances, or to wash products or process equipment. Processes such as [[mining]], [[chemical pulping]], [[pulp bleaching]], [[paper manufacturing]], textile production, dyeing, printing, and cooling of power plants use large amounts of water, requiring a dedicated water source, and often cause significant water pollution.

Water is used in [[power generation]]. [[Hydroelectricity]] is electricity obtained from [[hydropower]]. Hydroelectric power comes from water driving a water turbine connected to a generator. Hydroelectricity is a low-cost, non-polluting, renewable energy source. The energy is supplied by the motion of water. Typically a dam is constructed on a river, creating an artificial lake behind it. Water flowing out of the lake is forced through turbines that turn generators.

{{wide image|200407-sandouping-sanxiadaba-4.med.jpg|800px|[[Three Gorges Dam]] is the [[List of the largest hydroelectric power stations|largest hydro-electric power station]].}}

Pressurized water is used in [[Hydrodemolition|water blasting]] and [[water jet cutter]]s. Also, very high pressure water guns are used for precise cutting. It works very well, is relatively safe, and is not harmful to the environment. It is also used in the cooling of machinery to prevent overheating, or prevent saw blades from overheating.

Water is also used in many industrial processes and machines, such as the [[steam turbine]] and [[heat exchanger]], in addition to its use as a chemical [[solvent]]. Discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is [[water pollution|pollution]]. Pollution includes discharged solutes (chemical pollution) and discharged coolant water ([[thermal pollution]]). Industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge.

====Food processing====
[[File:Cuisson des pates.jpg|thumb|Water can be used to cook foods such as [[noodles]]]]

[[Boiling]], [[steaming]], and [[simmering]] are popular cooking methods that often require immersing food in water or its gaseous state, steam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xZHUAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA54|title=A Course in Household Arts: Part I|last=Duff|first=Sister Loretto Basil|date=1916|publisher=Whitcomb &amp; Barrows}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water is also used for [[dishwashing]]. Water also plays many critical roles within the field of [[food science]]. It is important for a food scientist to understand the roles that water plays within food processing to ensure the success of their products.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[Solution|Solutes]] such as salts and sugars found in water affect the physical properties of water. The boiling and freezing points of water are affected by solutes, as well as [[air pressure]], which is in turn affected by altitude. Water boils at lower temperatures with the lower air pressure that occurs at higher elevations. One [[mole (unit)|mole]] of sucrose (sugar) per kilogram of water raises the boiling point of water by {{convert|0.51|C-change|3}}, and one mole of salt per kg raises the boiling point by {{convert|1.02|C-change|3}}; similarly, increasing the number of dissolved particles lowers water's freezing point.&lt;ref name="vaclacik"&gt;{{cite book |title=Essentials of Food Science |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iCCsvwZrguUC&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=2007 |author1=Vaclavik, Vickie A. |author2=Christian, Elizabeth W |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-69939-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water hardness is also a critical factor in food processing and may be altered or treated by using a chemical ion exchange system. It can dramatically affect the quality of a product, as well as playing a role in sanitation. Water hardness is classified based on concentration of calcium carbonate the water contains.

Much of the universe's water is produced as a byproduct of [[star formation]]. The formation of stars is accompanied by a strong outward wind of gas and dust. When this outflow of material eventually impacts the surrounding gas, the shock waves that are created compress and heat the gas. The water observed is quickly produced in this warm dense gas.&lt;ref&gt;Melnick, Gary, [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] and Neufeld, David, [[Johns Hopkins University]] quoted in:

On 22 July 2011, a report described the discovery of a gigantic cloud of water vapor containing "140 trillion times more water than all of Earth's oceans combined" around a [[quasar]] located 12 billion light years from Earth. According to the researchers, the "discovery shows that water has been prevalent in the universe for nearly its entire existence".&lt;ref name="Clavin"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Clavin |first1=Whitney |last2=Buis |first2=Alan |title=Astronomers Find Largest, Most Distant Reservoir of Water |url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/universe/features/universe20110722.html |date=22 July 2011 |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=25 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724063244/http://www.nasa.gov/topics/universe/features/universe20110722.html |archive-date=24 July 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="water vapor cloud"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Astronomers Find Largest, Oldest Mass of Water in Universe |url=http://www.space.com/12400-universe-biggest-oldest-cloud-water.html |date=22 July 2011 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=23 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029230319/http://www.space.com/12400-universe-biggest-oldest-cloud-water.html |archive-date=29 October 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on models of the [[formation and evolution of the Solar System]] and that of other star systems, most other [[planetary system]]s are likely to have similar ingredients.

====Exotic forms====
Water and other [[volatiles]] probably comprise much of the internal structures of [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]] and the water in the deeper layers may be in the form of [[ionic water]] in which the molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper still as [[superionic water]] in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float about freely within the oxygen lattice.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727764.500-weird-water-lurking-inside-giant-planets.html Weird water lurking inside giant planets] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415160045/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727764.500-weird-water-lurking-inside-giant-planets.html |date=15 April 2015 }}, ''New Scientist'', 1 September 2010, Magazine issue 2776.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water and habitable zone===
{{Further|Water distribution on Earth}}

The existence of liquid water, and to a lesser extent its gaseous and solid forms, on Earth are vital to the existence of [[Organism|life on Earth]] as we know it. The Earth is located in the [[habitable zone]] of the [[solar system]]; if it were slightly closer to or farther from the [[Sun]] (about 5%, or about 8 million kilometers), the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would be far less likely to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=J.C.I. Dooge. "Integrated Management of Water Resources" |editor1=Ehlers, E. |editor2=Krafft, T |title=Understanding the Earth System: compartments, processes, and interactions |publisher=Springer |year=2001 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Habitable Zone |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/H/habzone.html |website=The Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Astronomy and Spaceflight |access-date=26 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523143747/http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/H/habzone.html |archive-date=23 May 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth's [[gravity]] allows it to hold an [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]]. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provide a temperature buffer ([[greenhouse effect]]) which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were smaller, a thinner atmosphere would allow temperature extremes, thus preventing the accumulation of water except in [[polar ice cap]]s (as on [[Mars]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The surface temperature of Earth has been relatively constant through [[geologic time]] despite varying levels of incoming solar radiation ([[insolation]]), indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric [[albedo]]. This proposal is known as the ''[[Gaia hypothesis]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The state of water on a planet depends on ambient pressure, which is determined by the planet's gravity. If a planet is sufficiently massive, the water on it may be solid even at high temperatures, because of the high pressure caused by gravity, as it was observed on exoplanets [[Gliese 436 b]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |magazine=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11864-strange-alien-world-made-of-hot-ice-and-steam.html |title=Strange alien world made of "hot ice" |date=6 May 2007 |first=David |last=Shiga |accessdate=28 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706143705/http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn11864-strange-alien-world-made-of-hot-ice-and-steam.html |archivedate=6 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[GJ 1214 b]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2009/pr200924.html |title=Astronomers Find Super-Earth Using Amateur, Off-the-Shelf Technology |author=Aguilar, David A. |date=16 December 2009 |publisher=Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics |accessdate=28 March 2010 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66sgAVTw2?url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2009/pr200924.html |archive-date=13 April 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Water politics]] is politics affected by water and [[water resources]]. For this reason, water is a strategic resource in the globe and an important element in many political conflicts. It causes health impacts and damage to biodiversity.

Access to safe drinking water has improved over the last decades in almost every part of the world, but approximately one billion people still lack access to safe water and over 2.5 billion lack access to adequate [[sanitation]].&lt;ref name=UN /&gt; However, some observers have estimated that by 2025 more than half of the [[world population]] will be facing water-based vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kulshreshtha, S.N |year=1998 |title=A Global Outlook for Water Resources to the Year 2025 |journal=Water Resources Management |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=167–184 |doi=10.1023/A:1007957229865}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report, issued in November 2009, suggests that by 2030, in some developing regions of the world, water demand will exceed supply by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mckinsey.com/App_Media/Reports/Water/Charting_Our_Water_Future_Full_Report_001.pdf |title=Charting Our Water Future: Economic frameworks to inform decision-making |format=PDF |accessdate=25 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705072816/http://www.mckinsey.com/App_Media/Reports/Water/Charting_Our_Water_Future_Full_Report_001.pdf |archivedate=5 July 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 United Nations report stated that "there is enough water for everyone", but that access to it is hampered by mismanagement and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[[UNESCO]], (2006), [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001444/144409E.pdf Water, a shared responsibility.

The authors of the 2007 [[Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture]] cited poor governance as one reason for some forms of water scarcity. Water governance is the set of formal and informal processes through which decisions related to water management are made. Good water governance is primarily about knowing what processes work best in a particular physical and socioeconomic context. Mistakes have sometimes been made by trying to apply 'blueprints' that work in the developed world to developing world locations and contexts. The Mekong river is one example; a review by the [[International Water Management Institute]] of policies in six countries that rely on the Mekong river for water found that thorough and transparent cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments were rarely undertaken. They also discovered that Cambodia's draft water law was much more complex than it needed to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/index.aspx |title=Search Results |website=International Water Management Institute (IWMI) |accessdate=3 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605124732/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/index.aspx |archive-date=5 June 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UN World Water Development Report]] (WWDR, 2003) from the [[World Water Assessment Program]] indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal [[hygiene]]. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from [[waterborne diseases]] (related to the consumption of contaminated water) or drought. In 2004, the UK charity [[WaterAid]] reported that a child dies every 15 seconds from easily preventable water-related diseases; often this means lack of [[sewage]] disposal; see toilet.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Organizations concerned with water protection include the [[International Water Association]] (IWA), [[WaterAid]], [[Water 1st]], and the American Water Resources Association. The [[International Water Management Institute]] undertakes projects with the aim of using effective water management to reduce poverty. Water related conventions are [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD), [[International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships]], [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] and [[Ramsar Convention]]. [[World Day for Water]] takes place on 22 March and [[World Ocean Day]] on 8 June.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==In culture==

===Religion===
{{Main|Water and religion}}
Water is considered a purifier in most religions. Faiths that incorporate ritual washing ([[Ritual purification|ablution]]) include [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], the [[Rastafari movement]], [[Shinto]], [[Taoism]], and [[Wicca]]. Immersion (or [[aspersion]] or [[affusion]]) of a person in water is a central [[sacrament]] of Christianity (where it is called [[baptism]]); it is also a part of the practice of other religions, including Islam (''[[Ghusl]]''), Judaism (''[[mikvah]]'') and [[Sikhism]] (''[[Amrit Sanskar]]''). In addition, a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including Islam and Judaism. In Islam, the five daily prayers can be done in most cases after completing washing certain parts of the body using clean water (''[[wudu]]''), unless water is unavailable (see ''[[Tayammum]]''). In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area (e.g., in the ritual of ''[[misogi]]'').

In Christianity, [[holy water]] is water that has been sanctified by a priest for the purpose of [[baptism]], the [[Blessing (Roman Catholic Church)|blessing]] of persons, places, and objects, or as a means of repelling evil.&lt;ref&gt;''Chambers's encyclopædia'', Lippincott &amp; Co (1870). p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Altman, Nathaniel (2002) ''Sacred water: the spiritual source of life''. pp. 130–133. {{ISBN|1-58768-013-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Zoroastrianism]], water (''[[aban|āb]]'') is respected as the source of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ĀB i. The concept of water in ancient Iran – Encyclopaedia Iranica |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ab-i-the-concept-of-water-in-ancient-iranian-culture |website=www.iranicaonline.org |publisher=[[Encyclopedia Iranica]] |accessdate=19 September 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180516223930/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ab-i-the-concept-of-water-in-ancient-iranian-culture |archive-date=16 May 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy===
The Ancient Greek philosopher [[Empedocles]] held that water is one of the four [[classical elements]] along with fire, earth and [[Air (classical element)|air]], and was regarded as the [[ylem]], or basic substance of the universe. [[Thales]], who was portrayed by Aristotle as an astronomer and an engineer, theorized that the earth, which is denser than water, emerged from the water. Thales, a [[monist]], believed further that all things are made from water. Plato believed the shape of water is an [[icosahedron]] which accounts for why it is able to flow easily compared to the cube-shaped earth.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, D. (2008). ''The beginnings of western science: The European scientific tradition in philosophical, religious, and institutional context, prehistory to A.D. 1450''. (2nd ed.). Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the theory of the [[humorism|four bodily humors]], water was associated with [[phlegm]], as being cold and moist. The [[Water (classical element)|classical element of water]] was also one of the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|five elements]] in traditional [[Chinese philosophy]], along with [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[wood (classical element)|wood]], and [[metal (classical element)|metal]].

Water is also taken as a role model in some parts of traditional and popular Asian philosophy. James Legge's 1891 translation of the ''Dao De Jing'' states, "The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike. Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao" and "There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it—for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/tao/taote.htm |title=Internet Sacred Text Archive Home |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=25 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712103909/http://www.sacred-texts.com/tao/taote.htm |archive-date=12 July 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'' in "Shui di" 水地 chapter further elaborates on symbolism of water, proclaiming that "man is water" and attributing natural qualities of the people of different Chinese regions to the character of local water resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctext.org/guanzi/shui-di Guanzi : Shui Di – Chinese Text Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20141106133901/http://ctext.org/guanzi/shui-di |date=6 November 2014 }}.

===Dihydrogen monoxide hoax===
{{Main|Dihydrogen monoxide hoax}}
Water's technically correct but rarely used [[chemical name]], "dihydrogen monoxide", has been used in a series of [[hoaxes]] and [[pranks]] that mock [[scientific illiteracy]]. This began in 1983, when an [[April Fools' Day]] article appeared in a newspaper in [[Durand, Michigan]]. The false story consisted of safety concerns about the substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.com/e/tech-science/dihydrogen-monoxide/ |title={title} |access-date=2 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502140130/http://www.dictionary.com/e/tech-science/dihydrogen-monoxide/ |archive-date=2 May 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
