'''Facebook, Inc.''' is an American online [[social media]] and [[social networking service]] company based in [[Menlo Park, California]]. Its website was launched on February 4, 2004, by [[Mark Zuckerberg]], along with fellow [[Harvard College]] students and roommates [[Eduardo Saverin]], [[Andrew McCollum]], [[Dustin Moskovitz]] and [[Chris Hughes]].

The founders initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students. Later they expanded it to [[List of colleges and universities in metropolitan Boston|higher education institutions in the Boston area]], the [[Ivy League]] schools, and [[Stanford University]]. Facebook gradually added support for students at various other universities, and eventually to high school students. Since 2006, anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though variations exist in this requirement, depending on local laws. The name comes from the [[face book]] directories often given to American university students. Facebook held its [[initial public offering]] (IPO) in February 2012, valuing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly listed public company. It began selling [[stock]] to the public three months later. Facebook makes most of its revenue from [[advertising|advertisement]]s that appear onscreen.

Facebook can be accessed from a large range of devices with [[Internet]] connectivity, such as [[desktop computer]]s, [[laptop]]s and [[tablet computer|tablet]] computers, and [[smartphone]]s. After registering, users can create a customized profile indicating their name, occupation, schools attended and so on. Users can add other users as [[Friending and following|"friends"]], exchange messages, post status updates, share photos, videos and links, use various [[Application software|software applications]] ("apps"), and receive notifications of other users' activity. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups organized by workplace, school, hobbies or other topics, and categorize their friends into lists such as "People From Work" or "Close Friends". Additionally, users can report or block unpleasant people.

Facebook has more than [[List of virtual communities with more than 100 million active users|2.2 billion monthly active users]] {{as of|2018|01|lc=y|post=.}} Its popularity has led to prominent media coverage for the company, including significant scrutiny over privacy and the psychological effects it has on users. In recent years, the company has faced intense pressure over the amount of [[fake news]], [[hate speech]] and [[Criticism of Facebook#Facebook Live|depictions of violence]] prevalent on its services, all of which it is attempting to counteract.

{{Main|History of Facebook}}

===2003–2006: Thefacebook, Thiel investment, and name change===
Zuckerberg wrote a program called "Facemash" in 2003 while attending [[Harvard University]] as a [[Sophomore year|sophomore]] (second-year student). According to ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', the site was comparable to [[Hot or Not]] and used "photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the "hotter" person".&lt;ref name="Harvard Crimson on Facemash"&gt;{{cite web |first=Katharine A. |last=Kaplan |title=Facemash Creator Survives Ad Board |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/11/19/facemash-creator-survives-ad-board-the/ |website=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |date=November 19, 2003 |accessdate=June 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours online.&lt;ref name="Fast Company on Zuckerberg"&gt;{{cite web |first=Ellen |last=McGirt |title=Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg: Hacker. Dropout.

Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged by the administration with breach of security, violating [[copyright]]s, and violating individual privacy. Ultimately, the charges were dropped.&lt;ref name="Harvard Crimson on Facemash" /&gt; Zuckerberg expanded on this initial project that semester by creating a social study tool ahead of an [[art history]] final exam. He uploaded all art images to a website, each of which was featured with a corresponding comments section, then shared the site with his classmates, and people started sharing notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jason |last=Kincaid |title=Startup School: An Interview With Mark Zuckerberg |url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/24/startup-school-an-interview-with-mark-zuckerberg/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=October 24, 2009 |accessdate=June 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thefacebook.png|thumb|Original layout and name of Thefacebook, 2004]]
A "[[face book]]" is a student directory featuring photos and basic information.&lt;ref name="Fast Company on Zuckerberg" /&gt; In 2003, there were no universal online facebooks at Harvard, with only paper sheets distributed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Sarah |last=Phillips |title=A brief history of Facebook |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/jul/25/media.newmedia |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=July 25, 2007 |accessdate=July 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and private online directories.&lt;ref name="Harvard Crimson on Facemash" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvard Crimson on Facebook"&gt;{{cite web |first=Alan T. |last=Tabak |title=Hundreds Register for New Facebook Website |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/2/9/hundreds-register-for-new-facebook-website/ |website=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |date=February 9, 2004 |accessdate=July 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckerberg told the ''Crimson'' that "Everyone's been talking a lot about a universal face book within Harvard. ... I think it's kind of silly that it would take the University a couple of years to get around to it. I can do it better than they can, and I can do it in a week."&lt;ref name="Harvard Crimson on Facebook" /&gt; In January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website, known as "TheFacebook", with the inspiration coming from an editorial in the ''Crimson'' about Facemash, stating that "It is clear that the technology needed to create a centralized Website is readily available ... the benefits are many."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Claire |last=Hoffman |title=The Battle For Facebook |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/the-battle-for-facebook-20100915 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=Wenner Media |date=September 15, 2010 |accessdate=July 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched "TheFacebook", originally located at thefacebook.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lily |last=Rothman |title=Happy Birthday, Facebook |url=http://time.com/3686124/happy-birthday-facebook/ |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=February 4, 2015 |accessdate=July 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six days after the site launched, Harvard seniors [[Cameron Winklevoss]], [[Tyler Winklevoss]], and [[Divya Narendra]] accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing that he would help them build a social network called [[ConnectU|HarvardConnection.com]]. They claimed that he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nicholas |last=Carlson |title=In 2004, Mark Zuckerberg Broke Into A Facebook User's Private Email Account |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-into-the-harvard-crimson-2010-3 |website=[[Business Insider]] |publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]] |date=March 5, 2010 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three complained to ''The Harvard Crimson'' and the newspaper began an investigation. They later filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg, subsequently settling in 2008&lt;ref name="nytb"&gt;{{cite news |work=New York Times blog |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/judge-ends-facebooks-feud-with-connectu/index.html |date=June 28, 2008 |title=Judge Ends Facebook's Feud With ConnectU |author=Stone, Brad}}&lt;/ref&gt; for 1.2 million [[shares]] (worth $300 million at Facebook's [[Initial public offering|IPO]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Dominic |last=Rushe |title=Facebook IPO sees Winklevoss twins heading for $300m fortune |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/feb/02/facebook-ipo-winklevoss-300m-fortune |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=February 2, 2012 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership was initially restricted to students of [[Harvard College]]; within the first month, more than half the undergraduates at Harvard were registered on the service.&lt;ref name="A brief history"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Sarah |last=Phillips |title=A brief history of Facebook |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/jul/25/media.newmedia |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=July 25, 2007 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eduardo Saverin]], Dustin Moskovitz, [[Andrew McCollum]], and [[Chris Hughes]] joined Zuckerberg to help manage the growth of the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Matt |last=Weinberger |title=33 photos of Facebook's rise from a Harvard dorm room to world domination |url=http://nordic.businessinsider.com/facebook-history-photos-2016-9 |website=[[Business Insider]] |publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]] |date=September 7, 2017 |accessdate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2004, Facebook expanded to the universities of [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Stanford]], and [[Yale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Facebook: a timeline of the social network |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/9052743/Facebook-a-timeline-of-the-social-network.html |website=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |date=February 1, 2012 |accessdate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later opened to all [[Ivy League]] colleges, [[Boston University]], [[New York University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[University of Washington|Washington]] and gradually most universities in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=June 13, 2008 |url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/09/11/facebook-opens-up-cx_rr_0911facebook.html |title=Open Facebook |work=Forbes |location=New York |date=September 11, 2006 |author=Rosmarin, Rachel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://tuftsdaily.com/archives/2004/04/12/online-network-created-by-harvard-students-flourishes/ |title=Online network created by Harvard students flourishes |work=[[The Tufts Daily]] |first=Lananh |last=Nguyen |date=April 12, 2004 |location=Medford, MA |accessdate=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2004, [[Napster|Napster co-founder]] and entrepreneur [[Sean Parker]]—an informal advisor to Zuckerberg—became the company's president.&lt;ref name="NYT_260505"&gt;{{cite news |author=Rosen, Ellen |title=Student's Start-Up Draws Attention and $13&amp;nbsp;Million |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/26/business/26sbiz.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 26, 2005 |accessdate=May 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2004, Facebook moved its operations base to [[Palo Alto, California]].&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{Cite press release |accessdate=March 5, 2008 |url=https://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?timeline |title=Company Timeline |publisher=Facebook |date=January 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received its first investment later that month from [[PayPal]] co-founder [[Peter Thiel]].&lt;ref name="beware"&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=April 30, 2008 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/general/beware-facebook/2008/01/18/1200620184398.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 |title=Why you should beware of Facebook |work=The Age |location=Melbourne |date=January 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the company dropped "the" from its name after purchasing the [[domain name]] facebook.com for [[United States dollar|US$]]200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Christopher |last=Williams |title=Facebook wins Manx battle for face-book.com |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/01/facebook_domain_dispute |website=[[The Register]] |publisher=Situation Publishing |date=October 1, 2007 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The domain facebook.com belonged to AboutFace Corporation before the purchase.

The social media website initially responded by stating that "while it may be vulgar and offensive, distasteful content on its own does not violate our policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=#FBrape: Will Facebook Heed Open Letter Protesting 'Endorsement Of Rape &amp; Domestic Violence'? |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/05/28/fbrape-will-facebook-heed-open-letter-protesting-endorsement-rape-domestic-violence_n_3346520.html |accessdate=May 29, 2013 |newspaper=The Huffington Post UK |date=May 28, 2013 |author=Nelson, Sara C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It decided to take action on May 29, 2013, after it "become clear that our systems to identify and remove hate speech have failed to work as effectively as we would like, particularly around issues of gender-based hate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rory |last=Carroll |title=Facebook gives way to campaign against hate speech on its pages |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/29/facebook-campaign-violence-against-women |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=May 29, 2013 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the average weekly wage in the county was [[United States dollar|US$]]3,240, 107% higher than the previous year.

Alongside other American technology figures like [[Jeff Bezos]] and [[Tim Cook]], Zuckerberg hosted visiting Chinese politician Lu Wei, known as the "Internet czar" for his influence in the enforcement of China's online policy, at Facebook's headquarters on December 8, 2014. The meeting occurred after Zuckerberg participated in a Q&amp;A session at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, on October 23, 2014, where he attempted to converse in Mandarin—although Facebook is banned in China, Zuckerberg is highly regarded among the people and was at the university to help fuel the nation's burgeoning entrepreneur sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Alex |last1=Hern |first2=Jonathan |last2=Kaiman |title=Mark Zuckerberg addresses Chinese university in Mandarin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/23/mark-zuckerberg-chinese-university-fluent-mandarin-video |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=October 23, 2014 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book of Chinese president [[Xi Jinping]] found on Zuckerberg's office desk attracted a great deal of attention in the media, after the Facebook founder explained to Lu, "I want them [Facebook staff] to understand socialism with Chinese characteristics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Adam Taylor |title=Why would Mark Zuckerberg want Facebook employees to read the Chinese president's book? |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/12/08/why-does-mark-zuckerberg-want-facebook-employees-to-read-the-chinese-presidents-book/ |accessdate=December 14, 2014 |work=The Washington Post |date=December 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015–present: Combating fake news and other ventures===
{{as of|2015|January|21|df=US}}, Facebook's algorithm is programmed to filter out false or misleading content, such as fake news stories and hoaxes, and will be supported by users who select the option to flag a story as "purposefully fake or deceitful news". According to Reuters, such content is "being spread like a wildfire" on the social media platform. Facebook maintained that "satirical" content, "intended to be humorous, or content that is clearly labeled as satire", will be taken into account and should not be intercepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alexei|last=Oreskovic|title=Facebook clamps down on fake news stories |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/20/us-facebook-hoaxes-idUSKBN0KT2C820150120|accessdate=February 4, 2015|work=Reuters |date=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithm, however, has been accused of maintaining a "[[filter bubble]]", where both material the user disagrees with&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Exposure to ideologically diverse news and opinion on Facebook |journal=Science |date=June 5, 2015 |pmid=25953820 |pages=1130–1132 |volume=348 |issue=6239 |doi=10.1126/science.aaa1160 |first=Eytan |last=Bakshy |first2=Solomon |last2=Messing |first3=Lada A. |last3=Adamic |bibcode=2015Sci...348.1130B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and posts with a low level of likes, will also not be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facebook Is Hiding Your Friends' Updates From You {{!}} Unicorn Booty|url = https://unicornbooty.com/facebook-is-hiding-your-friends-updates-from-you/|website = Unicorn Booty|accessdate = November 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, Zuckerberg prolonged period of paternity leave from 4 weeks to 4 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=shm&amp;sid1=105&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0008017659 |title=페이스북, 전세계 '아빠 출산휴가' 4주→4개월로 확대 |last=gong |date=November 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 19, 2018, Facebook announced that, for news distribution outside the United States, it would work with the U.S. funded [[democracy promotion]] organizations, [[International Republican Institute]] and the [[National Democratic Institute]] which are loosely affiliated with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] parties.&lt;ref name="R91918"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Joseph Menn |title=Facebook expands fake election news fight, but falsehoods still rampant |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-elections/facebook-expands-fake-election-news-fight-but-falsehoods-still-rampant-idUSKCN1LZ2XY |accessdate=September 28, 2018 |work=Reuters |agency=Reuters |date=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Digital Forensic Research Lab Facebook partners with the [[Atlantic Council]], a think tank affiliated with [[NATO]].&lt;ref name="R91918"/&gt; They have made a grants to Agência Lupa and Aos Fatos, Brazilian [[Fact checking|factchecker]]s, to better communicate with Facebook users during the Brazilian elections scheduled in 2018.&lt;ref name="P4318"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Daniel Funke |title=With money from Facebook, this Brazilian fact-checker created a Messenger bot for the election |url=https://www.poynter.org/news/money-facebook-brazilian-fact-checker-created-messenger-bot-election |accessdate=September 28, 2018 |work=poynter.org |date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, Facebook launched a brand of smart displays called [[Facebook Portal|Portal]] and Portal Plus (Portal+). The screen-enhanced smart speakers use [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]’s [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]] (intelligent personal assistant service). The devices also include video chat function supported via Facebook Messenger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/reviews/facebook-portal-plus-preview/|title=Facebook Portal brings Alexa and Messenger video chats to one device|date=2018-10-08|work=CNET|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/facebooks-portal-video-calling-smart-display-hits-stores/|title=You can buy Facebook's Portal smart displays starting today|date=2018-11-07|work=CNET|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to BusinessWeek.com, banner advertisements on Facebook have generally received one-fifth the number of clicks compared to those on the Web as a whole,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/nov2007/tc20071128_366355_page_2.htm |title=Facebook May Revamp Beacon |work=BusinessWeek |location=New York |date=November 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; although specific comparisons can reveal a much larger disparity. For example, while [[Google]] users click on the first advertisement for search results an average of 8% of the time (80,000 clicks for every one million searches),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |url=http://www.accuracast.com/seo-weekly/adwords-clickthrough.php |title=Google AdWords Click Through Rates Per Position |publisher=AccuraCast |date=October 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718064957/http://www.accuracast.com/seo-weekly/adwords-clickthrough.php |archivedate=July 18, 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook's users click on advertisements an average of 0.04% of the time (400 clicks for every one million pages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |url=http://valleywag.gawker.com/242234/facebook-consistently-the-worst-performing-site |title=Facebook 'consistently the worst performing site' |work=Gawker |date=March 7, 2007 |author=Denton, Nick |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701223257/http://valleywag.gawker.com/242234/facebook-consistently-the-worst-performing-site |archivedate=July 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful [[advertising campaign]]s on the site can have clickthrough rates as low as 0.05% to 0.04%, and CTR for ads tend to fall within two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |url=http://techpulse360.com/2009/08/12/facebook-says-its-click-through-rates-do-not-match-those-at-google/ |title=Facebook Says Click Through Rates Do Not Match Those At Google |work=TechPulse 360 |date=August 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822055844/http://techpulse360.com/2009/08/12/facebook-says-its-click-through-rates-do-not-match-those-at-google/ |archivedate=August 22, 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of Facebook's low CTR has been attributed to younger users enabling [[ad blocking]] software and their adeptness at ignoring advertising messages, as well as the site's primary purpose being social communication rather than content viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |url=http://www.bizreport.com/2007/07/advertisers_disappointed_with_facebooks_ctr.html |title=Advertisers disappointed with Facebook's CTR |work=BizReport |date=July 16, 2007 |author=Leggatt, Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to digital consultancy iStrategy Labs in mid-January 2014, three million fewer users aged between 13 and 17 years were present on Facebook's Social Advertising platform compared to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=3 Million Teens Leave Facebook In 3 Years: The 2014 Facebook Demographic Report |url=http://istrategylabs.com/2014/01/3-million-teens-leave-facebook-in-3-years-the-2014-facebook-demographic-report/ |work=iStrategy Labs |publisher=iStrategy Labs |accessdate=January 30, 2014 |author=DJ Saul |date=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Time'' writer and reporter Christopher Matthews stated in the wake of the iStrategy Labs results:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A big part of Facebook's pitch is that it has so much information about its users that it can more effectively target ads to those who will be responsive to the content.

[[File:Chart of Facebook, inc. Stock.png|thumb|Chart of Facebook's stock]]
The company released its own set of revenue data at the end of January 2014 and claimed: Revenues of US$2.59 billion were generated for the three months ending December 31, 2013; earnings per share were 31 cents; revenues of US$7.87 billion were made for the entirety of 2013; and Facebook's annual profit for 2013 was US$1.5 billion. During the same time, independent market research firm [[eMarketer]] released data in which Facebook accounted for 5.7 per cent of all global digital ad revenues in 2013 (Google's share was 32.4 per cent).&lt;ref name="2013 record quarterly results" /&gt; Revenue for the June 2014 quarter rose to $2.68 billion, an increase of 67 per cent over the second quarter of 2013.

However Microsoft has opted for a variation of the [[double Irish]] called the [[Single malt tax|single malt]], which relies on specific wording in the Ireland-Malta tax treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/multinationals-turn-from-double-irish-to-single-malt-to-avoid-tax-in-ireland-1.3290649 | title = Multinationals turn from Double Irish to Single Malt to avoid tax in Ireland | date = November 14, 2017 | work = Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To create a [[double Irish]] tax structure, a large quantum of [[intellectual property]] (or "IP") must be owned in a low-tax location, which the [[double Irish]] will then charge out to all non-US locations as a [[royalty payment]] (to relocate profits to the low-tax location). The US IRS is challenging Facebook Inc. on the valuation it used when it transferred IP from the US to Facebook Ireland in 2010 (which Facebook Ireland then revalued higher before charging out), as it was building it's [[double Irish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-exchanges/crypto-trading-tumbles-as-investment-scramble-unwinds-idUSKBN1HR1PJ|title=Facebook must give judge documents for U.S. tax probe of Irish unit|publisher=Reuters|date=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businesspost.ie/news/facebooks-dublin-hq-central-5bn-us-tax-probe-413079|title=Facebook's Dublin HQ central to $5bn US tax probe|publisher=Sunday Business Post|date=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case is ongoing and the IRS have noted that the potential quantum of fine is $3–5bn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-28/facebook-ordered-to-comply-with-u-s-tax-probe-of-irish-unit|title=Facebook Ordered to Comply With U.S. Tax Probe of Irish Unit|publisher=Bloomberg News|date=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] changes Facebook's global tax calculations. Facebook Ireland will now be subject to the US GILTI tax of 10.5% on global intangible profits (i.e. Irish profits). On the basis that Facebook Ireland is paying some tax, the effective minimum US tax for Facebook Ireland will be circa 11%. In contrast, Facebook Inc. would incur a special IP tax rate of 13.125% (the FDII rate) if it's Irish business was relocated back to the US. Higher tax relief in the US (21% vs. Irish at the GILTI rate) and accelerated capital expensing, would make this effective US rate circa 12%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://home.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/us/pdf/2018/02/tnf-new-law-book-feb6-2018.pdf|title=KPMG Report on TCJA|publisher=KPMG|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/ideacast/2017/12/breaking-down-the-new-u-s-corporate-tax-law|title=Breaking Down the New U.S. Corporate Tax Law|publisher=Harvard Business Review|date=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = US corporations could be saying goodbye to Ireland|url = https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/us-corporations-could-be-saying-goodbye-to-ireland-1.3359050?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fus-corporations-could-be-saying-goodbye-to-ireland-1.3359050|work=Irish Times|date=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closeness of the net effective tax costs of having Facebook Ireland, in Ireland, or relocated back to the US, was shown when Reuters revealed that Facebook Ireland is going to move 1.5bn non-EU accounts back to the US to limit exposure to the EU Commission's May 2018 [[GDPR]].&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; To irrevocably limit financial exposure to the EU's GDPR, these 1.5bn non-EU accounts (and their commercial processing) must be moved to the US. Facebook said that this move "did not carry tax implications", a statement which was mistakenly interpreted as implying that processing would stay in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/19/facebook-moves-15bn-users-out-of-reach-of-new-european-privacy-law|title=Facebook moves 1.5bn users out of reach of new European privacy law|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook is developed as one monolithic application. According to an interview in 2012 with Chuck Rossi, a build engineer at Facebook, Facebook compiles into a 1.5&amp;nbsp; GB binary blob which is then distributed to the servers using a custom [[BitTorrent]]-based release system. Rossi stated that it takes about 15 minutes to build and 15 minutes to release to the servers. The build and release process has zero downtime and new changes to Facebook are rolled out daily.&lt;ref name="Ars Technica BTS"/&gt;

Facebook uses a combination platform based on [[HBase]] to store data across distributed machines. Using a tailing architecture, new events are stored in log files, and the logs are tailed. The system rolls these events up and writes them into storage. The user interface then pulls the data out and displays it to users. Facebook handles requests as [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]] behavior. These requests are written to a log file using [[Scribe (log server)|Scribe]] (developed by Facebook).&lt;ref name="high scalability"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/3/22/facebooks-new-realtime-analytics-system-hbase-to-process-20.html |title=Facebook's New Real-time Analytics System: HBase To Process 20 Billion Events Per Day |publisher=Highscalability.com |date=March 22, 2011 |accessdate=December 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data is read from these log files using Ptail, an internally built tool to aggregate data from multiple Scribe stores. It tails the log files and pulls data out (thus the name). Ptail data are separated out into three streams so they can eventually be sent to their own clusters in different [[data center]]s (Plugin impression, News feed impressions, Actions (plugin + news feed)). Puma is used to manage periods of high data flow (Input/Output or IO). Data is processed in batches to lessen the number of times needed to read and write under high demand periods (A hot article will generate a lot of impressions and news feed impressions which will cause huge data skews). Batches are taken every 1.5 seconds, limited by memory used when creating a [[hash table]].&lt;ref name="high scalability" /&gt;

After this, data is output in PHP format (compiled with [[HipHop for PHP]]). The backend is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and Thrift is used as the messaging format so PHP programs can query Java services. Caching solutions are used to make the web pages display more quickly. The more and longer data is cached the less realtime it is. The data is then sent to [[MapReduce]] servers so it can be queried via Hive. This also serves as a backup plan as the data can be recovered from Hive. Raw logs are removed after a period of time.&lt;ref name="high scalability" /&gt;

On March 20, 2014, Facebook announced a new open-source programming language called [[Hack (programming language)|Hack]]. Before public release, a large portion of Facebook was already running and "battle tested" using the new language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2014/03/facebook-hack/ |title=Facebook Introduces 'Hack', the Programming Language of the Future |date=March 20, 2014 |work=Wired |first=Cade |last=Metz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook uses the Momentum platform from Message Systems to deliver the enormous volume of emails it sends to its users every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fortune.com/2014/10/06/message-systems-email-provider/ |title=The biggest email provider you've never heard of |date=October 6, 2014 |work=Fortune |first=Heather |last=Clancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
On July 20, 2008, Facebook introduced "Facebook Beta", a significant redesign of its user interface on selected networks. The Mini-Feed and Wall were consolidated, profiles were separated into tabbed sections, and an effort was made to create a cleaner look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/idg/IDG_852573C4006938800025748D0064C292.html |title=Facebook Facelift Targets Aging Users and New Competitors |work=The New York Times |author=Havenstein, Heather |date=July 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initially giving users a choice to switch, Facebook began migrating all users to the new version starting in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.new.facebook.com/blog.php?post=30074837130 |title=Moving to the new Facebook |publisher=The Facebook Blog |accessdate=September 12, 2008 |author=Slee, Mark |date=September 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 11, 2008, it was announced that Facebook was testing a simpler signup process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Arrington |authorlink=Michael Arrington |title=Facebook Testing Even Simpler Sign Up; Closing The Gap With MySpace In The U.S. |url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/12/11/facebook-testing-even-simpler-sign-up-closing-the-gap-with-myspace-in-the-us/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=December 11, 2008 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===User profile/personal timeline===
[[File:Facebook (login, signup page).jpg|thumb|Facebook login/signup screen]]

Each registered user on Facebook gets their own personal profile that shows their posts and content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kate |last=Knibbs |title=How Facebook's design has changed over the last 10 years |url=https://www.dailydot.com/debug/old-facebook-profiles-news-feeds/ |website=[[The Daily Dot]] |date=December 11, 2015 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The format of individual user pages was revamped in September 2011 and became known as "Timeline", a chronological feed of a user's stories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jacob |last=Schulman |title=Facebook introduces Timeline: 'a new way to express who you are' |url=https://www.theverge.com/2011/09/22/facebook-introduces-timeline-a-express-are |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=September 22, 2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Gayomali |title=Facebook Introduces 'Timeline': The 'Story' of Your Life |url=http://techland.time.com/2011/09/22/facebook-introduces-timeline-the-story-of-your-life/ |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=September 22, 2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; including status updates, photos, interactions with apps, and events.&lt;ref name="TNW Timeline"&gt;{{cite web |first=Matthew |last=Panzarino |title=Facebook introduces radical new profile design called Timeline: The story of your life [Video] |url=https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2011/09/22/facebook-introduces-timeline-the-story-of-your-life/ |website=The Next Web |date=September 22, 2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new layout also let users add a "cover photo", a large header image at the top of the Timeline.&lt;ref name="TNW Timeline"/&gt; Along with the new layout, users were also given more privacy settings to control the content on the Timeline.&lt;ref name="TNW Timeline"/&gt; In 2007, Facebook launched Facebook Pages for brands and celebrities to interact with their fanbase,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jason |last=Weaver |title=The Evolution of Facebook for Brands |url=http://mashable.com/2012/03/30/facebook-for-brands/ |website=[[Mashable]] |date=March 30, 2012 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Before Graph Search: Facebook's Biggest Changes |url=http://uk.pcmag.com/internet-products/58174/gallery/before-graph-search-facebooks-biggest-changes?p=3 |website=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with more 100,000 Pages launched in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rob |last=Hof |title=Facebook Declares New Era for Advertising |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2007-11-05/facebook-declares-new-era-for-advertising |website=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=November 6, 2007 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, Facebook introduced a "Usernames" feature, allowing users to choose a unique nickname used in the [[Uniform resource locator|URL]] for their personal profile, for easier sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Parr |title=Facebook to Launch Vanity URLs for All |url=http://mashable.com/2009/06/09/facebook-vanity-urls/ |website=[[Mashable]] |date=June 9, 2009 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nick |last=O'Neill |title=Facebook Begins Rolling Out Free Profile Usernames For Vanity URLs |url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/facebook-begins-rolling-out-free-profile-usernames-for-vanity-urls/ |website=[[Adweek]] |publisher=Beringer Capital |date=June 9, 2009 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, Facebook expanded the options for a user's gender setting, adding a custom input field that allows users to choose from a wide range of gender identities. Users can also set which set of gender-specific pronoun should be used in reference to them throughout the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Jordan |last1=Crook |first2=Josh |last2=Constine |title=Facebook Opens Up LGBTQ-Friendly Gender Identity And Pronoun Options |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/13/facebook-gender-identity/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=February 13, 2014 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facebook expands gender options: transgender activists hail 'big advance' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/13/transgender-facebook-expands-gender-options |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=February 14, 2014 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alexei |last=Oreskovic |title=In new profile feature, Facebook offers choices for gender identity |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-gender-idUSBREA1C1RU20140214 |website=[[Reuters]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |date=February 13, 2014 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, Facebook introduced a feature to allow users to ask for information not disclosed by other users on their profiles. If a user does not provide key information, such as location, hometown, or relationship status, other users can use a new "ask" button to send a message asking about that item to the user in a single click.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sam |last=Machkovech |title=Facebook adds naggy "ask" button to profile pages |url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2014/05/facebook-introduces-naggy-ask-function-into-profile-pages/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=May 16, 2014 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Laura |last=Stampler |title=Facebook's New 'Ask' Button Gives You a Whole New Way to Badger Friends About Their Relationship Status |url=http://time.com/104720/facebooks-new-ask-button-gives-you-a-whole-new-way-to-badger-friends-about-their-relationship-status/ |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=May 19, 2014 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===News Feed===
{{Main|News Feed}}
On September 6, 2006, [[News Feed (Facebook)|News Feed]] was announced, which appears on every user's homepage and highlights information including profile changes, upcoming events, and birthdays of the user's friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2207967130 |title=Facebook Gets a Facelift |accessdate=February 11, 2008 |last=Sanghvi |first=Ruchi |date=September 6, 2006 |publisher=The Facebook Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.colnect.com/2010/03/facebook-celebrate-your-birthday-every.html |title=Facebook: Celebrate Your Birthday Every Day |publisher=Colnect blog |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the News Feed caused dissatisfaction among Facebook users; some complained it was too cluttered and full of undesired information, others were concerned that it made it too easy for others to track individual activities (such as relationship status changes, events, and conversations with other users).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=June 28, 2008 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/sep2006/tc20060908_536553.htm? |title=Facebook Learns from Its Fumble |work=BusinessWeek |location=New York |date=September 8, 2006 |author=Lacy, Sarah |authorlink=Sarah Lacy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Zuckerberg issued an apology for the site's failure to include appropriate customizable privacy features. Since then, users have been able to control what types of information are shared automatically with friends. Users are now able to prevent user-set categories of friends from seeing updates about certain types of activities, including profile changes, Wall posts, and newly added friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=June 28, 2008 |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/ebusiness/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=192700574 |title=Facebook Founder Apologizes In Privacy Flap; Users Given More Control |work=[[InformationWeek]] |location=New York |date=September 8, 2006 |author=Gonsalves, Antone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 2010, Facebook was granted a patent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=7669123 |status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; on certain aspects of its News Feed. The patent covers News Feeds in which links are provided so that one user can participate in the same activity of another user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://themelis-cuiper.com/22/us-patent-no-7669123.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515155132/http://themelis-cuiper.com/22/us-patent-no-7669123.html |archivedate=May 15, 2011 |title=US Patent No. 7669123 |accessdate=March 9, 2010 |publisher=Social Media |date=March 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patent may encourage Facebook to pursue action against websites that violate its patent, which may potentially include websites such as [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/02/26/facebook.patent/index.html |title=Facebook's news-feed patent could mean lawsuits |work=CNN |date=February 26, 2010 |accessdate=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most popular applications on Facebook is the [[Facebook features#Photo and video uploads|Photos]] application, where users can upload albums and photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Arrington |authorlink=Michael Arrington |title=Facebook Launches Facebook Platform; They are the Anti-MySpace |url=https://techcrunch.com/2007/05/24/facebook-launches-facebook-platform-they-are-the-anti-myspace/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=May 24, 2007 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook allows users to upload an unlimited number of photos, compared with other [[image hosting service]]s such as [[Photobucket]] and [[Flickr]], which apply limits to the number of photos that a user is allowed to upload. During the first years, Facebook users were limited to 60&amp;nbsp;photos per album. As of May 2009, this limit has been increased to 200&amp;nbsp;photos per album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=87157517130 |title=Share More Memories with Larger Photo Albums |accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=2305272732&amp;topic=7363 |title=Upload: 60 or 200 photos in the same album? |accessdate=January 25, 2009 |publisher=Facebook |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029231740/https://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=2305272732&amp;topic=7363 |archivedate=October 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=2305272732&amp;topic=4947 |title=How can I add more than 60 photos to an album? |accessdate=January 25, 2009 |publisher=Facebook |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029231801/https://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=2305272732&amp;topic=4947 |archivedate=October 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2003726&amp;l=5f3c8&amp;id=1352160452 |title=Example of album from a regular user with a 200-photo limit |accessdate=January 25, 2009 |publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Privacy settings can be set for individual albums, limiting the groups of users that can see an album. For example, the privacy of an album can be set so that only the user's friends can see the album, while the privacy of another album can be set so that all Facebook users can see it. Another feature of the Photos application is the ability to "[[tag (metadata)|tag]]", or label, users in a photo. For instance, if a photo contains a user's friend, then the user can tag the friend in the photo. This sends a notification to the friend that she has been tagged, and provides a link to see the photo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=March 15, 2008 |url=https://www.facebook.com/help.php?page=7 |title=Photos |publisher=Facebook |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731205244/https://www.facebook.com/help.php?page=7 |archivedate=July 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 7, 2012, Facebook launched its App Center to its users.

On May 13, 2015, Facebook in association with major news portals launched a program "Instant Articles" to provide rich news experience. Instant articles provides users, access to articles on Facebook news feed without leaving the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.fb.com/2015/05/12/instantarticles/ |title=Introducing Instant Articles – Facebook Media |work=fb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://previewtech.net/facebook-launches-instant-articles/ |title=Facebook launches "Instant Articles" |work=Preview Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the technology news website [[Gizmodo]] on May 9, 2016, Facebook curators routinely suppress or promote news that is deemed to meet a political agenda. For example, articles about [[Black Lives Matter]] would be listed even if they did not meet the trending criteria of News Feed. Likewise, positive news about conservative political figures were regularly excised from Facebook pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gizmodo.com/former-facebook-workers-we-routinely-suppressed-conser-1775461006/ |title=Former Facebook Workers: We Routinely Suppressed Conservative News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, Facebook launched Facebook Stories for iOS and Android in Ireland. The feature, following the format of Snapchat and Instagram stories, allows users to upload photos and videos that appear above friends' and followers' News Feeds and disappear after 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Facebook Stories puts a Snapchat clone above the News Feed |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/25/facebook-stories/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=January 25, 2017 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, 2017, Facebook introduced the [[Facebook 3D Posts|3D Posts]] feature to allow for uploading interactive 3D assets in the News Feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rachel |last=Franklin |title=Building Connections Through Creativity and Opening VR to Everyone |url=https://www.oculus.com/blog/building-connections-through-creativity-and-opening-vr-to-everyone/ |website=Oculus |date=October 11, 2017 |accessdate=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 11, 2018, Facebook announced that it would be changing its News Feed algorithm to prioritize what friends and family share and de-emphasize content from media companies. The change was intended to maximize the "meaningful interactions" that people have with content on Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/technology/facebook-news-feed.html |title=Facebook Overhauls News Feed to Focus on What Friends and Family Share |last=Isaac |first=Mike |date=2018 |work=The New York Times|access-date=January 17, 2018 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Like button===
{{Main|Facebook like button}}
The "like" button, stylized as a "thumbs up" icon, was first enabled on February 9, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jason |last=Kincaid |title=Facebook Activates "Like" Button; FriendFeed Tires Of Sincere Flattery |url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/09/facebook-activates-like-button-friendfeed-tires-of-sincere-flattery/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=February 9, 2009 |accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enables users to easily interact with status updates, comments, photos and videos, links shared by friends, and advertisements.

Facebook Messenger is an [[instant messaging]] service and software application.

and Mentions, which lets users in group conversations type @ to give a particular user a notification.&lt;ref name="verge-mentions"/&gt;

In March 2015, Facebook announced that it would start letting businesses and users interact through Messenger with features such as tracking purchases and receiving notifications, and interacting with customer service representatives. It also announced that third-party developers could integrate their apps into Messenger, letting users enter an app while inside Messenger and optionally share details from the app into a chat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Hope |last=King |title=7 big changes coming to Facebook |url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/25/technology/facebook-f8-messenger/ |website=[[CNN]] |date=March 25, 2015 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, it introduced an [[API]] for developers to build [[Software agent|chatbots]] into Messenger, for uses such as news publishers building bots to give users news through the service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Casey |last=Newton |title=Facebook launches a bot platform for Messenger |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/12/11395806/facebook-messenger-bot-platform-announced-f8-conference |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=April 12, 2016 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in April 2017, it enabled the [[M (virtual assistant)|M virtual assistant]] for users in the U.S., which scans chats for keywords and suggests relevant actions, such as its payments system for users mentioning money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nick |last=Statt |title=Facebook's AI assistant will now offer suggestions inside Messenger |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/6/15200836/facebook-messenger-m-suggestions-ai-assisant |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=April 6, 2017 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Facebook Messenger's AI 'M' suggests features to use based on your convos |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/06/facebook-messengers-ai-m-suggests-features-to-use-based-on-your-convos/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=April 6, 2017 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Facebook expanded the use of bots, incorporating group chatbots into Messenger as "Chat Extensions", adding a "Discovery" tab for finding bots, and enabling special, branded [[QR code]]s that, when scanned, take the user to a specific bot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Facebook Messenger launches group bots and bot discovery tab |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/18/facebook-bot-discovery/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=April 18, 2017 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Following===
On September 14, 2011, Facebook added the ability for users to provide a "Subscribe" button on their page, which allows users to subscribe to public postings by the user without needing to add him or her as a friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Meghan Peters |url=http://mashable.com/2011/09/15/facebook-subscribe-users/ |title=Facebook Subscribe Button: What It Means for Each Type of User |publisher=Mashable.com |date=September 15, 2011 |accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction, Facebook also introduced a system in February 2012 to verify the identity of certain accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Facebook Launches Verified Accounts and Pseudonyms |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/15/facebook-verified-accounts-alternate-names/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=February 15, 2012 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, Facebook announced that because of user confusion surrounding its function, the Subscribe button would be re-labeled as a "Follow" button{{emdash}}making it more similar to other social networks with similar functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ellis |last=Hamburger |title=Facebook snubs 'Subscribe' button in favor of Twitter-esque 'Follow' on all profile pages |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/5/3731986/facebook-like-follow |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=December 5, 2012 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison with Myspace===
The media often compares Facebook to [[Myspace]], but one significant difference between the two Web sites is the level of customization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=March 8, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/technology/25social.html |title=Facebook Expands Into MySpace's Territory |work=The New York Times |author=Stone, Brad |date=May 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another difference is Facebook's requirement that users give their true identity, a demand that MySpace does not make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=September 10, 2010 |url=http://mobilitytoday.com/news/009500/facebook_connect_mt |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024033731/http://mobilitytoday.com/news/009500/facebook_connect_mt |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |title=Facebook Connect fully integrated into Mobility Today |publisher=Mobility Today Fitness |date=May 7, 2009 |author=Ciccone, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; MySpace allows users to decorate their profiles using [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS), while Facebook allows only [[plain text]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=April 30, 2008 |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,134635-c,categories/article.html |title=Is Facebook the New MySpace? |work=[[PC World]] |location=San Francisco |date=July 24, 2007 |author=Sullivan, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook has a number of features with which users may interact. They include the [[Tag (Facebook)|Wall]], a space on every user's profile page that allows friends to post messages for the user to see;&lt;ref name="off"&gt;{{cite web |last=Der |first=Kevin |url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=3532972130 |title=Facebook is off-the-wall |accessdate=July 30, 2007 |publisher=The Facebook Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Super Poke|Pokes]], which allows users to send a virtual "poke" to each other (a notification then tells a user that he or she has been poked);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=March 9, 2008 |url=https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=210552142308915&amp;ref_query=pok |title=Inbox, Messages and Pokes |publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Facebook features#Photo and video uploads|Photos]], that allows users to upload albums and photos;&lt;ref name="gifts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2406207130 |accessdate=March 5, 2008 |title=The Facebook Gifts |publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Facebook features#Status updates|Status]], which allows users to inform their friends of their whereabouts and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/story/0,25642,22822400-5014108,00.html |title=Facebook is&amp;nbsp; ... reconsidering the word "is" |accessdate=March 8, 2008 |work=news.com.au Technology blog |first=Andrew |last=Ramadge |date=November 26, 2007 |location=Sydney |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128222428/http://www.news.com.au/technology/story/0%2C25642%2C22822400-5014108%2C00.html |archivedate=November 28, 2007 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook also allows users to tag various people in photographs. Depending on privacy settings, anyone who can see a user's profile can also view that user's Wall. In July 2007, Facebook began allowing users to post attachments to the Wall, whereas the Wall was previously limited to textual content only.&lt;ref name="off" /&gt; Facebook also differs from Myspace in the form of advertising used. Facebook uses advertising in the form of banner ads, referral marketing, and games. Myspace, on the other hand, uses [[Google]] and [[AdSense]].&lt;ref name="diffen.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.diffen.com/difference/Facebook_vs_MySpace |title=Facebook vs MySpace – Difference and Comparison – Diffen |work=diffen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a difference in the userbase of each site. MySpace, initially, was much more popular with high school students, while Facebook was more popular among college students. A study by the American firm Nielsen Claritas showed that Facebook users are more inclined to use other professional networking sites, such as [[LinkedIn]], than Myspace users.&lt;ref name="diffen.com" /&gt;

===Privacy===

Facebook enables users to choose their own privacy settings and choose who can see specific parts of their profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=June 13, 2009 |url=https://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=search |title=Search Privacy |publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website is free to its users and generates revenue from advertising, such as [[Web banner|banner ads]].&lt;ref name="tc"&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=March 9, 2008 |url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-6066533.html |title=Facebook goes corporate |work=[[ZDNet]] News |date=April 28, 2006 |author=Barton, Zoe |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526001748/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-6066533.html |archivedate=May 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook requires a user's name and profile picture (if applicable) to be accessible by everyone. Users can control who sees other information they have shared, as well as who can find them in searches, through their privacy settings.&lt;ref name="Choose Your Privacy Settings"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy |title=Choose Your Privacy Settings |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 6, 2007, Facebook launched [[Facebook Beacon]], which was a part of Facebook's advertisement system until it was discontinued in 2009. Its purpose was to allow targeted advertisements and allowing users to share their activities with their friends.

In 2010, Facebook's security team began expanding its efforts to reduce the risks to users' privacy,&lt;ref name="revealed"&gt;{{cite web |title=Revealed: Which social networks pose the biggest risk? |url=http://www.sophos.com/blogs/gc/g/2010/02/01/revealed-social-networks-pose-biggest-risk/ |publisher=[[Sophos]] |last=Cluley |first=Graham |date=February 1, 2010 |accessdate=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Criticism of Facebook#Privacy concerns|privacy concerns]] remain.&lt;ref name="liebertpub1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/cyber.2012.0323 |pmid=23374170 |title=Who Commits Virtual Identity Suicide?

On November 29, 2011, Facebook settled [[Federal Trade Commission]] charges that it deceived consumers by failing to keep privacy promises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=November 29, 2011 |url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2011/11/privacysettlement.shtm |title=Facebook Settles FTC Charges That It Deceived Consumers By Failing To Keep Privacy Promises |work=[[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] |date=November 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013 [[High-Tech Bridge]] published a study showing that links included in Facebook messaging service messages were being accessed by Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.htbridge.com/news/social_networks_can_robots_violate_user_privacy.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20140103153742/https://www.htbridge.com/news/social_networks_can_robots_violate_user_privacy.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 3, 2014 |title=Social networks: can robots violate user privacy? |date=August 27, 2013 |accessdate=January 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014 two users filed a lawsuit against Facebook alleging that their privacy had been violated by this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Van Grove |first1=Jennifer |title=Facebook sued for allegedly intercepting private messages |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-sued-for-allegedly-intercepting-private-messages/ |website=[[CNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 16, 2015 |date=January 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, in the wake of the [[#Cambridge Analytica|Cambridge Analytica data breach scandal]], and refuting a report to the contrary by [[Reuters]], Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would implement additional privacy "controls and settings" worldwide.&lt;ref name="guar1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Solon |first1=Olivia |title=Fact-checking Mark Zuckerberg's testimony about Facebook privacy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/11/fact-checking-mark-zuckerberg-testimony-congress |accessdate=June 29, 2018 |publisher=The Guardian |date=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These settings were originally intended for deployment in Europe in order to comply with the European Union's [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (GDPR), which take effect in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/zuckerberg-gdpr/ |title=Zuckerberg says Facebook will offer GDPR privacy controls everywhere |website=TechCrunch |language=en-US|access-date=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lead-up to its implementation, Facebook also changed its terms of service and privacy policy to specify that users within the European Union are served by Facebook Ireland, Ltd., while users outside of the EU are served by Facebook Inc., which is subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Previously, all users outside of Canada and the United States were served by Facebook Ireland, Ltd., which would make an additional 1.5 billion users subject to EU law in their use of Facebook than legally needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/facebook-removes-1-5-billion-users-from-protection-of-eu-privacy-law/|title=Facebook removes 1.5 billion users from protection of EU privacy law|work=Ars Technica|access-date=April 21, 2018|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the breach, Facebook withdrew its opposition to the [[California Consumer Privacy Act]]. Facebook, Google, Comcast, AT&amp;T, and Verizon had previously donated $200,000 each to a $1 million fund dedicated to opposing of the [[ballot measure]]. The Committee to Protect California jobs, which opposed the ballot question and is sponsored by the [[California Chamber of Commerce]] told ''Ars Technica'' that "Facebook has NOT dropped its opposition to the measure".

On September 28, 2018, Facebook saw a drop in its share price by 3% due to a major breach in its security, exposing the data of 50 million users.

===Facebook Bug Bounty Program===
[[File:Facebook t-shirt with whitehat debit card for Hackers.jpg|thumb|A Facebook "[[White hat (computer security)|White Hat]]" debit card, given to researchers who report [[security bug]]s.]]

On July 29, 2011, Facebook announced its Bug Bounty Program in which security researchers will be paid a minimum of $500 for reporting security holes on Facebook's website. Facebook's Whitehat page for security researchers says: "If you give us a reasonable time to respond to your report before making any information public and make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service during your research, we will not bring any lawsuit against you or ask law enforcement to investigate you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://facebook.com/whitehat |title=Facebook |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2389460,00.asp |title=Facebook Offers $500 Bounty for Reporting Bugs: Why So Cheap |publisher=PC Magazine |accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook started paying researchers who find and report security bugs by issuing them custom branded "White Hat" debit cards that can be reloaded with funds each time the researchers discover new flaws. "Researchers who find bugs and security improvements are rare, and we value them and have to find ways to reward them," Ryan McGeehan, former manager of Facebook's security response team, told CNET in an interview. "Having this exclusive black card is another way to recognize them. They can show up at a conference and show this card and say 'I did special work for Facebook.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-hands-out-white-hat-debit-cards-to-hackers/ |title=Facebook hands out White Hat debit cards to hackers |publisher=[[CNET]] |accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India, which has the second largest number of bug hunters in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Indian Security Researchers tops Facebook Bug Bounty Program |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-dna-special-indians-are-worlds-top-bug-bounty-hunters-1884018 |work=DNA Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt; tops the Facebook Bug Bounty Program with the largest number of valid bugs. "Researchers in Russia earned the highest amount per the report in 2013, receiving an average of $3,961 for 38 bugs. India contributed the largest number of valid bugs at 136, with an average reward of $1,353. The U.S. reported 92 issues and averaged $2,272 in rewards. Brazil and the UK were third and fourth by volume, with 53 bugs and 40 bugs, respectively, and average rewards of $3,792 and $2,950", Facebook quoted in a post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bug Bounty |first1=Facebook |title=Facebook Bug Bounty |url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-bug-bounty/bug-bounty-highlights-and-updates/818902394790655 |publisher=Facebook Security |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 2015, it was reported that teenagers preferred competing web sites such as [[Instagram]] and [[Snapchat]]. The estimated number of teens leaving Facebook was a million per year.&lt;ref name=wash&gt;{{cite news |first=Nico |last=Lang |title=Why teens are leaving Facebook: It's 'meaningless' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/02/21/why-teens-are-leaving-facebook-its-meaningless/ |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=February 21, 2015 |accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, after skepticism about the accuracy of its "monthly active users" measurement, Facebook changed its definition of an "active user", now defining it as a logged-in member who visits the Facebook site through the web browser or mobile app, or uses the [[Facebook Messenger]] app, in the last 30 days of the date of measurement. This excludes the use of third-party services with Facebook integration, which was previously counted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Cohen |title=Facebook Changes Definition of Monthly Active Users |url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/monthly-active-users-definition-revised/ |website=[[Adweek]] |publisher=Beringer Capital |date=November 6, 2015 |accessdate=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2018, chief privacy officer Erin Egan noted that a software bug had resulted in about 14 million Facebook users having their default sharing setting for all new posts set to "public". Facebook issued a notification to users which were exposed to this issue. A Facebook spokesperson said the notification is the start of new proactive and transparent way for the company to handle issues going forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/07/technology/facebook-public-post-error/index.html |title=Facebook bug set 14 million users' sharing settings to public |date=June 7, 2018 |accessdate=June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shadow profiles===
"Shadow profile" has become a catch all term for data that is outside the scope of a user's official profile or voluntarily shared content. This includes data that Facebook collects on non-users that may be collected by the [[Facebook analytics Pixel]] or location data from a mobile phone. During his 2018 Congressional testimony, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that while users have control over data collection for advertising purposes, "On security, there may be specific things about how you use Facebook, even if you're not logged in, that we keep track of to make sure you're not abusing the systems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brandom |first=Russell |title=Even if you're not signed up, Facebook has a shadow profile for you |work=The Verge |accessdate=April 13, 2018 |date=April 11, 2018 |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17225482/facebook-shadow-profiles-zuckerberg-congress-data-privacy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckerberg also stated that he was not familiar with the term "shadow profile", though he did confirm that Facebook gathers data on individuals who have not signed up for Facebook accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How Facebook can have your data even if you're not on Facebook |work=USA TODAY |accessdate=April 13, 2018 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2018/04/13/how-facebook-can-have-your-data-even-if-youre-not-facebook/512674002/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cambridge Analytica===
{{main|Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal}}
In March 2018, [[whistleblower]]s revealed that personal information from over 87 million Facebook users was sold to [[Cambridge Analytica]], a political data analysis firm that had worked for [[Donald Trump]]'s presidential campaign. The data was collected using an app created by Global Science Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lewis |first1=Paul |last2=Wong |first2=Julia Carrie |title=Facebook employs psychologist whose firm sold data to Cambridge Analytica |work=the Guardian |accessdate=March 20, 2018 |date=March 18, 2018 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/18/facebook-cambridge-analytica-joseph-chancellor-gsr}}&lt;/ref&gt; While approximately 270,000 people volunteered to use the app, Facebook's [[Application programming interface|API]] also permitted data collection from the friends of app users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Franceschi-Bicchierai |first=Lorenzo |title=Why We're Not Calling the Cambridge Analytica Story a 'Data Breach' |work=Motherboard |accessdate=March 20, 2018 |date=March 19, 2018 |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/3kjzvk/facebook-cambridge-analytica-not-a-data-breach}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the information was first reported Facebook tried to downplay the significance of the breach, and attempted to suggest that the stolen data was no longer available to Cambridge Analytica. However, with increasing scrutiny, Facebook issued a statement expressing alarm and suspended Cambridge Analytica, while review of documents and interviews with former Facebook employees suggested that Cambridge Analytica was still in possession of the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html |title=How Trump Consultants Exploited the Facebook Data of Millions |first1=Matthew |last1=Rosenberg |first2=Nicholas |last2=Confessore |first3=Carole |last3=Cadwalladr |date=March 17, 2018 |publisher= |via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a violation of the [[consent decree]] entered into law by Facebook with the [[Federal Trade Commission]], and violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the company's possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/03/18/facebook-may-have-violated-ftc-privacy-deal-say-former-federal-officials-triggering-risk-of-massive-fines/ |title=Facebook may have violated FTC privacy deal, say former federal officials, triggering risk of massive fines |last=Timberg |first=Craig |date=March 18, 2018 |work=Washington Post|access-date=March 25, 2018 |last2=Romm |first2=Tony |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Guardian]]'' reporter [[Carole Cadwalladr]] who broke the story, both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica threatened to sue the newspaper if it published the story and continually tried to prevent its publication. After the story was published anyway, Facebook claimed that it had been "lied to". Cadwalladr said that Facebook was trying to shift the blame onto a third party. Nick Thompson of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' and [[CBS]] News pointed out that Cambridge Analytica obtained all the personal data without having to "breach" Facebook, and that "It didn't work because somebody hacked in and broke stuff, it worked because Facebook has built the craziest most invasive advertising model in the history of the world and someone took advantage of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cambridge-analytica-facebook-knew-for-two-years-no-action-taken/ |title=Facebook knew of illicit user profile harvesting for 2 years, never acted |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 23, 2018, The [[High Court of Justice|English High Court]] granted an application by the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] for a warrant to search [[Cambridge Analytica]]'s London offices ending a standoff between Facebook's data team and the Information Commissioner over who is responsible for the forensic searching of the company's servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/23/uk-high-court-grants-cambridge-analytica-search-warrant-to-ico.html |title=UK High Court grants Cambridge Analytica search warrant to ICO |last=CNBC |date=March 23, 2018 |work=CNBC|access-date=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 25, Zuckerberg placed a [[newspaper ad]] in UK and US newspapers apologising over a "breach of trust"; newspapers included ''[[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph]]'', ''[[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]]'', ''[[The Mail on Sunday|Mail on Sunday]]'', ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'', ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' and ''[[Daily Express|Sunday Express]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43532948 |title=Facebook boss apologises in newspaper ads |date=March 25, 2018 |work=BBC News|access-date=March 25, 2018 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|You may have heard about a quiz app built by a university researcher that leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014. This was a breach of trust, and I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time. We're now taking steps to make sure this doesn't happen again.

We've already stopped apps like this from getting so much information. Now we're limiting the data apps get when you sign in using Facebook.

We're also investigating every single app that had access to large amounts of data before we fixed this. We expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected.

Finally, we'll remind you which apps you've give access to your information – so you can shut off the ones you don't want anymore.

Thank you for believing in this community. I promise to do better for you.}}

===Public apologies===
In early March 2018, [[The Observer]] reported that a "political consultancy" known as [[Cambridge Analytica]] had been provided access to the [[personal data]] of about 50 million Americans by Facebook. On March 21, 2018, Facebook founder [[Mark Zuckerberg]] issued the company's first public statement since this information was publicly disclosed. However, another article was published on April 4 by [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] that reports a statement made by Facebook regarding the number of people affected. Mike Schroepfer – Facebook's chief technology officer – disclosed that the amount is closer to 87 million via a blog post.&lt;ref&gt;Lapowsky, Issie.

According to a study done by Jeffery Child and Shawn Starcher in 2015, Facebook is a social media platform where "both known and unknown audiences can gain access to posted context, increasing the possibility for privacy breakdowns".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.chb.2015.08.035 |title=Fuzzy Facebook privacy boundaries: Exploring mediated lurking, vague-booking, and Facebook privacy management |journal=Computers in Human Behavior |volume=54 |pages=483–90 |year=2016 |last1=Child |first1=Jeffrey T |last2=Starcher |first2=Shawn C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has a history of making efforts of rapprochement for such privacy crises. Past apologies of Facebook started in 2009, when Facebook first launched their site worldwide.

The threats were made on Facebook, in April, before the bombings. Sayoc threatened to kill Somin and his family and "feed the bodies to Florida alligators".

=== Controversy regarding Definers Public Affairs and Soros ===
In October 2017, Facebook expanded its work with [[Definers Public Affairs]], that had originally been hired to monitor press coverage of the company to address concerns regarding [[Russian meddling in the 2016 United States elections|Russian meddling]], data sharing, hate speech on Facebook and calls for protection through public policy and regulation.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html|title=Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook’s Leaders Fought Through Crisis|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Definers had established a Silicon Valley outpost earlier that year led by Tim Miller, a former spokesman for Jeb Bush. For tech firms, he argued in one interview, a goal should be to “have positive content pushed out about your company and negative content that’s being pushed out about your competitor.” A research document circulated by Definers to reporters this summer, just a month after the House hearing, cast [[George Soros]], a frequent subject of [[Antisemitic canard|antisemitic conspiracy theories]] and hate speech, falsely as the unacknowledged force behind what appeared to be a broad anti-Facebook movement. Definers also created other negative media, along with [[America Rising]], which was distributed through NTK Network that was later picked up by larger media organisations like [[Breitbart News|Breitbart]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/14/facebook-george-soros-pr-firm-discredit-critics-crisis|title=Facebook reportedly discredited critics by linking them to George Soros|last=Wong|first=Julia Carrie|date=2018-11-15|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the public outcry from the ''New York Times'' article documenting the activity of Definers Public Affairs Facebook cut ties with the agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/technology/facebook-definers-soros.html|title=Facebook Cuts Ties With Definers Public Affairs Following Outcry|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media impact===
In April 2011, Facebook launched a new portal for marketers and creative agencies to help them develop brand promotions on Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/marketing |title=Facebook Marketing Solutions |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=January 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company began its push by inviting a select group of British advertising leaders to meet Facebook's top executives at an "influencers' summit" in February 2010. Facebook has now been involved in campaigns for ''[[True Blood]]'', ''[[American Idol]]'', and ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/04/19/4-ways-facebook-social-tv-1-video/ |title=Move Over Twitter: Facebook Wants a Piece of Social TV, Too |work=tvgenius: TV Trends Blog |author=Wells, Emma K. |date=April 19, 2011 |accessdate=May 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426131045/http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/04/19/4-ways-facebook-social-tv-1-video/ |archivedate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; News and media outlets such as ''The Washington Post'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Washington Post |date=January 6, 2012 |title=Facebook data reveal what GOP presidential candidates' supporters 'like' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/facebook-data-reveals-what-gop-presidential-candidates-supporters-like/2012/01/06/gIQAOScufP_graphic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Financial Times''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/e82978cc-3e19-11e1-ac9b-00144feabdc0.html |title=Romney tags Facebook to build momentum |date=January 16, 2012 |last=Dembosky |first=April}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ABC News&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=ABCNews.com |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/social-media-opens-trove-of-voter-info-to-campaigns/ |title=Social Media Opens Trove of Voter Info to Campaigns |date=January 10, 2012 |last=Bingham |first=Amy}}&lt;/ref&gt; have used aggregated Facebook fan data to create various infographics and charts to accompany their articles.

===Economic impact===
Facebook, Inc. has utilized growing internet markets using a social media platform to expand its user base while generating billions of dollars in revenue from Facebook's companies. Through empirical findings, economists have been able to identify key areas where Facebook has been able to stimulate economic activity by offering a free [[public good]] in that one user will not reduce the amount available to another, while also generating positive [[Externality|externalities]]. Thus, mobile phone manufactures and carriers have been beneficiaries of Facebook's [[spillover effect]]. Three distinct areas have been found to add the most economic impact: platform competition, the marketing place, and user behavior data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1017/CBO9781139060011.003 |chapter=The Economics of Internet Markets |title=Advances in Economics and Econometrics |pages=48–75 |year=2013 |last1=Levin |first1=Jonathan |isbn=978-1-139-06001-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook's daily active users have increased 18% year-over-year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://investor.fb.com/financials/ |title=SEC Quarterly Report |last= |first= |date=March 31, 2017 |website=Facebook, Inc.|access-date=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and burgeoning from 1 million users in 2004, to over 1.9 billion in 2017. Facebook began to reduce its carbon impact after being publicly criticised by Greenpeace for its long-term reliance on coal power and consequently high carbon footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/12/greenpeace-declares-victory-over-facebook-data-centers/ |title=Greenpeace Declares Victory Over Facebook Data Centers |publisher=WIRED |date= |accessdate=August 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2016, Facebook's total revenue earnings were $27.638 billion, gross profit was $23.849 billion and a net income for the year was $10.188 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB/financials?p=FB |title=(FB) Income Statement |last= |first= |date=December 31, 2016 |website=Yahoo Finance|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160802231028/http://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB/financials?p=FB|archive-date=August 2, 2016|dead-url=yes|access-date=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook provides a development platform for many [[social network game|social gaming]], communication, feedback, review, and other applications related to online activities. This open platform of Facebook has spawned many new businesses and added thousands of jobs to the economy. [[Zynga Inc.]], a leading company in social gaming app development, is an example of those businesses. An [[Econometrics|econometric]] analysis studied the impact of Facebook on the economy in terms of the number of jobs created and the economic value of those jobs. The conservative estimate was that the app development platform of Facebook added more than 182,000 jobs in the U.S. economy in 2011. The total economic value of the added employment was about $12 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Facebook App Economy |date=September 19, 2011 |publisher=University of Maryland |url=https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/files/Documents/Centers/DIGITS/AppEconomyImpact091911.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social impact===
{{Main|Social networking service#Social impact|Social impact of the Internet#Social networking and entertainment|Social capital}}
Facebook has affected the social life and activity of people in various ways. Facebook allows people using computers or mobile phones to continuously stay in touch with friends, relatives and other acquaintances wherever they are in the world, as long as there is access to the Internet. It has reunited lost family members and friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7739245 |title=Father finds daughter on Facebook after 20 years apart |work=WABC |location=New York |date=October 23, 2010 |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.in.msn.com/international/article.aspx?cp-documentid=3570509&amp;= |title=Facebook reunites father, daughter after 48 years |work=MSN India |location=Delhi |date=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows users to trade ideas, stay informed with local or global developments, and unite people with common interests and/or beliefs through open, closed and private groups and other pages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/topics/1164/social-networks/chart/1103/top-10-social-networks-in-q1-2013/ Half of the World's Online Population Uses Facebook], GlobalWebIndex.

Facebook's social impact has also changed how people communicate. Rather than having to reply to others through email, Facebook allows users to broadcast or share content to others, and thereby to engage others or be engaged with others' posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/02/02/facebook-turns-10-cultural-impact/5063979/ |title=How Facebook changed our lives |date=February 2, 2014 |work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook has been successful and more socially impactful than many other social media sites. David Kirkpatrick, technology journalist and author of ''The Facebook Effect'', believes that Facebook is structured in a way that is not easily replaceable. He challenges users to consider how difficult it would be to move all the relationships and photos to an alternative. Facebook has let people participate in an atmosphere with the "over the backyard fence quality" of a small town, despite the move to larger cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/facebook-effect-social-network-changed-world-122656206.html |title=Facebook Effect: How the Social Network Changed the World |date=May 18, 2012 |work=Yahoo Finance}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per [[Pew Research Center]] survey, 44 percent of the overall US population gets news through Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/facebook-extends-lead-as-news-gateway-study/articleshow/52456528.cms |title=Facebook extends lead as news gateway: Study – The Economic Times |website=The Economic Times|access-date=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a presentation by [[California State University]] psychology professor Larry D. Rosen, he notes that teenagers using Facebook exhibit more [[narcissistic]] tendencies, while young adults show signs of antisocial behavior, [[mania]], and aggressiveness. However, he also found positive effects from Facebook use, including signs of "virtual empathy" towards online friends and helping [[introvert]]ed persons learn social skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ysolt |last=Usigan |title=Facebook makes teens narcissistic, anxious and depressed – but also nice, social and engaged |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-makes-teens-narcissistic-anxious-and-depressed-but-also-nice-social-and-engaged/ |website=[[CBS News]] |publisher=[[CBS]] |date=August 29, 2011 |accessdate=December 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that "While nobody can deny that Facebook has altered the landscape of social interaction, particularly among young people, we are just now starting to see solid psychological research demonstrating both the positives and the negatives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Parrish |title=Facebook May Lead to Psychological Disorders in Teens |url=https://www.tomsguide.com/us/Facebook-Poke-Me-Larry-D-Rosen-California-State-University-Narcissistic,news-12105.html |website=[[Tom's Hardware|Tom's Guide]] |publisher=[[Purch Group]] |date=August 8, 2011 |accessdate=December 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, made use first of the personal computer and the Internet, and after 2010 of the smart phones to connect hundreds of millions of people, especially those under age 35.

Facebook is having an impact on local government as well. [[Justin Smith (Colorado sheriff)|Justin Smith]], a Colorado sheriff uses Facebook to disseminate his ideas on matters relating to local, state, and national concerns. He also publicizes crimes, particularly those that his department solves. He has seven thousand followers on the social medium, considered a large number.

As American political strategists turn their attention to the 2016 presidential contest, they identify Facebook as an increasingly important advertising tool. Recent technical innovations have made possible more advanced divisions and subdivisions of the electorate. Most important, Facebook can now deliver video ads to small, highly targeted subsets. Television, by contrast, shows the same commercials to all viewers, and so cannot be precisely tailored.&lt;ref&gt;Shane Goldmacher, "Facebook the Vote: The social network at the center of American digital life could become the epicenter of the presidential race," [http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/facebook-the-vote-20150612 ''National Journal Magazine'' June 13, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
