It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter alpha, from which it derives. The uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. The lowercase version can be written in two forms: the double-storey a and single-storey ɑ. The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in italic type.\n\nThe earliest certain ancestor of \"A\" is aleph (also written 'aleph), the first letter of the Phoenician alphabet, which consisted entirely of consonants (for that reason, it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from a true alphabet). In turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto-Sinaitic script influenced by Egyptian hieroglyphs, styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.\n\nBy 1600 BC, the Phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. Its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the Hebrew or Arabic aleph.\nWhen the ancient Greeks adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stop—the consonant sound that the letter denoted in Phoenician and other Semitic languages, and that was the first phoneme of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter—so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel , and called it by the similar name of alpha. In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the Greek Dark Ages, dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the Greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.\n\nThe Etruscans brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the Italian Peninsula and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the Etruscan alphabet to write the Latin language, and the resulting letter was preserved in the Latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages, including English.\n\nDuring Roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter \"A\". First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other \"permanent\" media. There was also a cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces. Due to the \"perishable\" nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as majuscule cursive, minuscule cursive, and semicursive minuscule. Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. The known variants include the early semi-uncial, the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.\n\nAt the end of the Roman Empire (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe. Among these were the semicursive minuscule of Italy, the Merovingian script in France, the Visigothic script in Spain, and the Insular or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule of Great Britain. By the 9th century, the Caroline script, which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.\n\n15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today. These variants, the \"Italic\" and \"Roman\" forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italic form, also called \"script a,\" is used in most current handwriting and consists of a circle and vertical stroke. This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter tau in the hands of medieval Irish and English writers. The Roman form is used in most printed material; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it (\"a\"). Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.\n\nItalic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest (set in Roman type). There are some other cases aside from italic type where \"script a\" (\"ɑ\"), also called Latin alpha, is used in contrast with Latin \"a\" (such as in the International Phonetic Alphabet).\n\nIn modern English orthography, the letter represents at least seven different vowel sounds:\n\nThe double sequence does not occur in native English words, but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as \"Aaron\" and \"aardvark\". However, occurs in many common digraphs, all with their own sound or sounds, particularly , , , , and .\n\nIn most languages that use the Latin alphabet, denotes an open unrounded vowel, such as , , or . An exception is Saanich, in which (and the glyph Á) stands for a close-mid front unrounded vowel .\n\nIn phonetic and phonemic notation:\n\nIn algebra, the letter \"a\" along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities, whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet (\"x\", \"y\", \"z\") are used to denote unknown quantities.\n\nIn geometry, capital A, B, C etc. are used to denote segments, lines, rays, etc. A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a triangle, the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A.\n\n\"A\" is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; \"A grade\" for clean restaurants; A-list celebrities, etc. Such associations can have a motivating effect, as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.\n\n\"A\" is used as a prefix on some words, such as asymmetry, to mean \"not\" or \"without\" (from Greek).\n\nFinally, the letter A is used to denote size, as in a narrow size shoe, or a small cup size in a brassiere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is also the third letter of the ISO basic Latin alphabet. It is named \"cee\" (pronounced ) in English.\n\n\"C\" comes from the same letter as \"G\". The Semites named it gimel. The sign is possibly adapted from an Egyptian hieroglyph for a staff sling, which may have been the meaning of the name \"gimel\". Another possibility is that it depicted a camel, the Semitic name for which was \"gamal\". Barry B. Powell, a specialist in the history of writing, states \"It is hard to imagine how gimel = \"camel\" can be derived from the picture of a camel (it may show his hump, or his head and neck!)\".\n\nIn the Etruscan language, plosive consonants had no contrastive voicing, so the Greek 'Γ' (Gamma) was adopted into the Etruscan alphabet to represent . Already in the Western Greek alphabet, Gamma first took a '' form in Early Etruscan, then '' in Classical Etruscan. In Latin it eventually took the \" form in Classical Latin. In the earliest Latin inscriptions, the letters \" were used to represent the sounds and (which were not differentiated in writing). Of these, \" was used to represent or before a rounded vowel, \" before \", and \" elsewhere. During the 3rd century BC, a modified character was introduced for , and \" itself was retained for . The use of \" (and its variant \") replaced most usages of \" and \". Hence, in the classical period and after, \" was treated as the equivalent of Greek gamma, and \" as the equivalent of kappa; this shows in the romanization of Greek words, as in 'ΚΑΔΜΟΣ', 'ΚΥΡΟΣ', and 'ΦΩΚΙΣ' came into Latin as \", \" and \", respectively.\n\nOther alphabets have letters homoglyphic to 'c' but not analogous in use and derivation, like the Cyrillic letter Es (С, с) which derives from the lunate sigma, named due to its resemblance to the crescent moon.\n\nWhen the Roman alphabet was introduced into Britain, represented only , and this value of the letter has been retained in loanwords to all the insular Celtic languages: in Welsh, Irish, Gaelic, represents only . The Old English Latin-based writing system was learned from the Celts, apparently of Ireland; hence in Old English also originally represented ; the Modern English words \"kin, break, broken, thick\", and \"seek,\" all come from Old English words written with : \"cyn, brecan, brocen, þicc\", and \"séoc\". But during the course of the Old English period, before front vowels ( and ) were palatalized, having changed by the tenth century to , though was still used, as in \"cir(i)ce, wrecc(e)a\". On the continent, meanwhile, a similar phonetic change had also been going on (for example, in Italian).\n\nIn Vulgar Latin, became palatalized to in Italy and Dalmatia; in France and the Iberian peninsula, it became . Yet for these new sounds was still used before the letters and . The letter thus represented two distinct values. Subsequently, the Latin phoneme (spelled ) de-labialized to meaning that the various Romance languages had before front vowels. In addition, Norman used the letter so that the sound could be represented by either or , the latter of which could represent either or depending on whether it preceded a front vowel letter or not. The convention of using both and was applied to the writing of English after the Norman Conquest, causing a considerable re-spelling of the Old English words. Thus while Old English \"candel, clif, corn, crop, cú,\" remained unchanged, \"Cent, cæ´ᵹ (cé´ᵹ), cyng, brece, séoce,\" were now (without any change of sound) spelled 'Kent', 'keȝ', 'kyng', 'breke', and 'seoke'; even \"cniht\" ('knight') was subsequently changed to 'kniht' and \"þic\" ('thick') changed to 'thik' or 'thikk'. The Old English 'cw' was also at length displaced by the French 'qu' so that the Old English \"cwén\" ('queen') and \"cwic\" ('quick') became Middle English 'quen' 'quik', respectively. The sound , to which Old English palatalized had advanced, also occurred in French, chiefly from Latin before 'a'. In French it was represented by the digraph , as in \"champ\" (from Latin \"camp-um\") and this spelling was introduced into English: the Hatton Gospels, written about 1160, have in Matt. i-iii, \"child, chyld, riche, mychel,\" for the \"cild, rice, mycel,\" of the Old English version whence they were copied. In these cases, the Old English gave place to but, on the other hand, in its new value of came in largely in French words like \"processiun, emperice, grace,\" and was also substituted for 'ts' in a few Old English words, as \"miltse, bletsien,\" in early Middle English \"milce, blecien\". By the end of the thirteenth century both in France and England, this sound de-affricated to ; and from that time has represented before front vowels either for etymological reasons, as in \"lance, cent,\" or to avoid the ambiguity due to the \"etymological\" use of for , as in \"ace, mice, once, pence, defence\".\n\nThus, to show etymology, English spelling has \"advise\", \"devise\" (instead of \"advize\", \"devize\"), while \"advice, device, dice, ice, mice, twice,\" etc., do not reflect etymology; example has extended this to \"hence, pence, defence,\" etc., where there is no etymological reason for using . Former generations also wrote \"\" for \"sense\". Hence, today the Romance languages and English have a common feature inherited from Vulgar Latin spelling conventions where takes on either a \"hard\" or \"soft\" value depending on the following letter.\n\nIn English orthography, generally represents the \"soft\" value of before the letters (including the Latin-derived digraphs and , or the corresponding ligatures and ), , and , and a \"hard\" value of before any other letters or at the end of a word. However, there are a number of exceptions in English: \"soccer\" and \"Celt\" are words that have where would be expected.\n\nThe \"soft\" may represent the sound in the digraph when this precedes a vowel, as in the words 'delicious' and 'appreciate', and also in the word \"ocean\" and its derivatives.\n\nThe digraph most commonly represents , but can also represent (mainly in words of Greek origin) or (mainly in words of French origin). For some dialects of English, it may also represent in words like \"loch\", while other speakers pronounce the final sound as . The trigraph always represents .\n\nThe digraph is often used to represent the sound after short vowels.\n\nIn the Romance languages French, Spanish, Italian, Romanian and Portuguese, generally has a \"hard\" value of and a \"soft\" value whose pronunciation varies by language.

Herodotus reports that \"San\" was the name given by the Dorians to the same letter called \"Sigma\" by the Ionians.\n\nThe Western Greek alphabet used in Cumae was adopted by the Etruscans and Latins in the 7th century BC, over the following centuries developing into a range of Old Italic alphabets including the Etruscan alphabet and the early Latin alphabet.\nIn Etruscan, the value of Greek sigma (𐌔) was maintained, while san (𐌑)\nrepresented a separate phoneme, most likely (transliterated as \"ś\"). \nThe early Latin alphabet adopted sigma, but not san, as Old Latin did not have a phoneme.\n\nThe shape of Latin S arises from Greek Σ by dropping one out of the four strokes of that letter.\nThe (angular) S-shape composed of three strokes existed as a variant of the four-stroke letter Σ already in the epigraphy in Western Greek alphabets, and the three and four strokes variants existed alongside one another in the classical Etruscan alphabet. In other Italic alphabets (Venetic, Lepontic), the letter could be represented as a zig-zagging line of any number between three and six strokes.\n\nThe Italic letter was also adopted into Elder Futhark, as \"Sowilō\" (), and appears with four to eight strokes in the earliest runic inscriptions, but is occasionally reduced to three strokes () from the later 5th century, and appears regularly with three strokes in Younger Futhark.\n\nThe minuscule form ſ, called the long \"s\", developed in the early medieval period, within the Visigothic and Carolingian hands, with predecessors in the half-uncial and cursive scripts of Late Antiquity. It remained standard in western writing throughout the medieval period and was adopted in early printing with movable types. \nIt existed alongside minuscule \"round\" or \"short\" \"s\", which was at the time only used at the end of words.\n\nIn most western orthographies, the ſ gradually fell out of use during the second half of the 18th century, although it remained in occasional use into the 19th century.\nIn Spain, the change was mainly accomplished between the years 1760 and 1766. In France, the change occurred between 1782 and 1793. Printers in the United States stopped using the long \"s\" between 1795 and 1810. In English orthography, the London printer John Bell (1745–1831) pioneered the change. His edition of Shakespeare, in 1785, was advertised with the claim that he \"ventured to depart from the common mode by rejecting the long 'ſ' in favor of the round one, as being less liable to error...\" \"The Times\" of London made the switch from the long to the short \"s\" with its issue of 10 September 1803. \n\"Encyclopædia Britannica\"'s 5th edition, completed in 1817, was the last edition to use the long \"s\".\n\nIn German orthography, long \"s\" was retained in Fraktur (Schwabacher) type as well as in standard cursive (Sütterlin) well into the 20th century, and was officially abolished in 1941.\nThe ligature of \"ſs\" (or \"ſz\") was retained, however, giving rise to the \"Eszett\", \"ß\" in contemporary German orthography.\n\nThe letter is the seventh most common letter in English and the third-most common consonant after and . It is the most common letter in starting and ending position.\n\nIn English and several other languages, primarily Western Romance ones like Spanish and French, final is the usual mark of plural nouns. It is the regular ending of English third person present tense verbs.\n\nThe digraph for English arises in Middle English (alongside ), replacing the Old English digraph. Similarly, Old High German was replaced by in Early Modern High German orthography.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
