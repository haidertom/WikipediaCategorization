Google was founded in 1998 by [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]] while they were Ph.D. students at [[Stanford University]] in [[California]]. Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through [[Preferred stock|supervoting]] stock. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the [[Googleplex]]. In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate called [[Alphabet Inc.]] Google is Alphabet's leading subsidiary and will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests. [[Sundar Pichai]] was appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page who became the CEO of Alphabet.

The company's rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine ([[Google Search]]). It offers services designed for work and productivity ([[Google Docs]], [[Google Sheets]], and [[Google Slides]]), email ([[Gmail]]/[[Inbox by Gmail|Inbox]]), scheduling and time management ([[Google Calendar]]), cloud storage ([[Google Drive]]), social networking ([[Google+]]), instant messaging and video chat ([[Google Allo]], [[Google Duo|Duo]], [[Hangouts]]), language translation ([[Google Translate]]), mapping and navigation ([[Google Maps]], [[Waze]], [[Google Earth]], [[Street View]]), video sharing ([[YouTube]]), note-taking ([[Google Keep]]), and photo organizing and editing ([[Google Photos]]). The company leads the development of the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile operating system, the [[Google Chrome]] web browser, and [[Chrome OS]], a lightweight operating system based on the Chrome browser. Google has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics manufacturers in the production of its [[Google Nexus|Nexus]] devices, and it released multiple hardware products in October 2016, including the [[Pixel (smartphone)|Google Pixel]] smartphone, [[Google Home]] smart speaker, [[Google Wifi]] mesh wireless router, and [[Google Daydream]] virtual reality headset. Google has also experimented with becoming an Internet carrier. In February 2010, it announced [[Google Fiber]], a fiber-optic infrastructure that was installed in Kansas City; in April 2015, it launched [[Project Fi]] in the United States, combining Wi-Fi and cellular networks from different providers; and in 2016, it announced the Google Station initiative to make public Wi-Fi available around the world, with initial deployment in India.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Byford, The Verge. "[https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/27/13070922/google-station-public-wi-fi-india Google Station is a new platform that aims to make public Wi-Fi better]." September 27, 2016.

[[Alexa Internet]] monitors commercial web traffic and lists Google.com as the most visited website in the world. Several other Google services also figure in the top 100 most visited websites, including [[YouTube]] and [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]. Google is the most valuable brand in the world {{as of|2017|lc=y|post=,}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/worlds-most-valuable-brands-facebook-google-apple-amazon-a7556571.html |title=Google is now the world's most valuable brand |date=February 1, 2017 |work=The Independent|access-date=August 31, 2017 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has received significant [[Criticism of Google|criticism]] involving issues such as [[Privacy concerns regarding Google|privacy concerns]], tax avoidance, antitrust, [[Censorship by Google|censorship]], and search neutrality. Google's [[mission statement]] is "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful", and its unofficial slogan was "Don't be evil". In October 2015, the motto was replaced in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase ''"Do the right thing"'', while the original one was retained in the code of conduct of Google.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Around May 2018, the slogan was silently removed from the code's clauses, leaving only one generic reference in its last paragraph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393|title=Google Removes 'Don't Be Evil' Clause From Its Code of Conduct|first=Kate|last=Conger|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, the two theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/422/ |title=The PageRank Citation Ranking: Bringing Order to the Web |last1=Page |first1=Lawrence |last2=Brin |first2=Sergey |last3=Motwani |first3=Rajeev |last4=Winograd |first4=Terry |date=November 11, 1999 |website=Stanford University |accessdate=February 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118014915/http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/422/ |archive-date=November 18, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They called this new technology [[PageRank]]; it determined a website's [[Relevance (information retrieval)|relevance]] by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/corporate/tech.html |title=Technology Overview |website=Google, Inc. |accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-diglib.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/WP/get/SIDL-WP-1997-0072?1 |title=PageRank: Bringing Order to the Web |last=Page |first=Larry |website=Stanford Digital Library Project |date=August 18, 1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020506051802/http://www-diglib.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/WP/get/SIDL-WP-1997-0072?1 |archivedate=May 6, 2002 |accessdate=November 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google was initially funded by an August 1998 contribution of $100,000 from [[Andy Bechtolsheim]], co-founder of [[Sun Microsystems]]; the money was given before Google was incorporated.&lt;ref name="Bechtolsheim"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/04/29/MNGLD6CFND34.DTL |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919030812/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F2004%2F04%2F29%2FMNGLD6CFND34.DTL |archivedate=September 19, 2009 |title=For early Googlers, key word is $$ |last=Kopytoff |first=Verne |date=April 29, 2004 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |publisher=Hearst Communications |accessdate=February 19, 2010 |location=San Francisco |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Google received money from three other [[angel investor]]s in 1998: [[Amazon.com]] founder [[Jeff Bezos]], Stanford University computer science professor [[David Cheriton]], and entrepreneur [[Ram Shriram]].&lt;ref name="1998 Investments"&gt;''On September 7, 1998, the day Google officially incorporated, he [Shriram] wrote out a check for just over $250,000, one of four of this size the founders received.'' {{Cite book |title=Googled: The End of the World As We Know It |last=Auletta |first=Ken |date=October 26, 2010 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=9780143118046 |edition=Reprint |location=New York, N.Y. |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,&lt;ref name="1998 Investments"/&gt; a new $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=https://www.google.com/pressrel/pressrelease1.html |archiveurl=https://www.google.com/press/pressrel/pressrelease1.html |archivedate=March 9, 2000 |title=Google Receives $25&amp;nbsp;Million in Equity Funding |date=June 7, 1999 |location=Palo Alto, Calif. |publisher=Google |accessdate=February 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with major investors including the [[venture capital]] firms [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]] and [[Sequoia Capital]].&lt;ref name="Bechtolsheim" /&gt;

Early in 1999, Brin and Page decided they wanted to sell Google to [[Excite]]. They went to Excite CEO George Bell and offered to sell it to him for $1 million. He rejected the offer.

In September 2015, Google engineering manager Rachel Potvin revealed details about Google's software code at an engineering conference. She revealed that the entire Google codebase, which spans every single service it develops, consists of over 2 billion lines of code. All that code is stored in a code repository available to all 25,000 Google engineers, and the code is regularly copied and updated on 10 Google data centers. To keep control, Potvin said Google has built its own "version control system", called "Piper", and that "when you start a new project, you have a wealth of libraries already available to you. Almost everything has already been done." Engineers can make a single code change and deploy it on all services at the same time. The only major exceptions are that the PageRank search results algorithm is stored separately with only specific employee access, and the code for the Android operating system and the Google Chrome browser are also stored separately, as they don't run on the Internet. The "Piper" system spans 85 [[Terabyte|TB]] of data. Google engineers make 25,000 changes to the code each day and on a weekly basis change approximately 15 million lines of code across 250,000 files. With that much code, automated bots have to help. Potvin reported, "You need to make a concerted effort to maintain code health. And this is not just humans maintaining code health, but robots too.” Bots aren't writing code, but generating a lot of the data and configuration files needed to run the company's software. "Not only is the size of the repository increasing," Potvin explained, "but the rate of change is also increasing. This is an exponential curve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Cade |last=Metz |title=Google is 2 billion lines of code - and it's all in one place |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/09/google-2-billion-lines-codeand-one-place/ |website=Wired |date=September 16, 2015 |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Tarantola |title=Google's codebase is ludicrously huge for good reason |url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/09/18/googles-codebase-is-ludicrously-huge-for-good-reason/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=September 18, 2015 |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2010–present ====
In 2010, [[Google Energy]] made its first investment in a [[renewable energy]] project, putting $38.8&amp;nbsp;million into two [[wind farm]]s in [[North Dakota]]. The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5&amp;nbsp;megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes. The farms, which were developed by [[NextEra Energy Resources]], will reduce fossil fuel use in the region and return profits.

Google's [[AdWords]] allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through a cost-per-click scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Vangie |last=Beal |title=AdWords - Google AdWords |url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/adwords.html |website=Webopedia |publisher=QuinStreet Inc. |accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sister service, Google [[AdSense]], allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Vangie |last=Beal |title=AdSense - Google AdSense |url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/adsense.html |website=Webopedia |publisher=QuinStreet Inc. |accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of [[click fraud]], which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to 20&amp;nbsp; percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mills |first=Elinor |url=http://news.cnet.com/Google-to-offer-advertisers-click-fraud-stats/2100-1024_3-6098469.html |title=Google to offer advertisers click fraud stats |work=news.cnet.com |publisher=CNET |date=July 25, 2006 |accessdate=July 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2003, Google stopped showing the advertisements of [[Oceana (non-profit group)|Oceana]], a non-profit organization protesting a major cruise ship's sewage treatment practices. Google cited its editorial policy at the time, stating "Google does not accept advertising if the ad or site advocates against other individuals, groups, or organizations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2004/05/17/google-somewhat-lifts-oceana-ad-ban |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130095413/http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2004/05/17/google-somewhat-lifts-oceana-ad-ban |archivedate=January 30, 2009 |title=Google Somewhat Lifts Oceana Ad Ban |publisher=webpronews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, Google reached an advertising agreement with Yahoo!, which would have allowed Yahoo! to feature Google advertisements on its web pages. The alliance between the two companies was never completely realized because of [[Competition law|antitrust]] concerns by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]]. As a result, Google pulled out of the deal in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2008/10/31/yahoo-and-google-may-dump-their-deal/print/ |title=Yahoo and Google may dump their deal |last=Mclntyre |first=Douglas |publisher=Bloggingstocks.com |date=October 31, 2008 |accessdate=October 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/ending-our-agreement-with-yahoo.html |title=Ending our agreement with Yahoo! |last=Drummond |first=David |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=October 26, 2010 |publisher=Google, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Google started rejecting all flash-based adverts replacing them by HTML5. Google's plan was to go “100% HTML5” beginning on January 2, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://latestgadgets.tech/2016/02/11/google-will-reject-flash-based-adverts-push-html5/|title=Google Will Reject All Flash Based Adverts In a Push For HTML5 • Latest Gadgets|date=February 11, 2016|work=Latest Gadgets|access-date=June 13, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[comScore]] market research from November 2009, [[Google Search]] is the dominant search engine in the United States market, with a [[market share]] of 65.6%.&lt;ref name="comscore"&gt;{{Cite news |date=December 16, 2006 |title=comScore Releases November 2009 U.S. Search Engine Rankings |url=http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2009/12/comScore_Releases_November_2009_U.S._Search_Engine_Rankings |accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google [[search engine indexing|indexes]] billions of web pages to allow users to search for the information they desire through the use of keywords and [[Operator (computer programming)|operators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Arrington |title=Google's Misleading Blog Post: The Size Of The Web And The Size Of Their Index Are Very Different |url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/07/25/googles-misleading-blog-post-on-the-size-of-the-web/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=July 25, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, ''[[The New York Times]]'' complained about Google's [[search engine indexing|indexing]], claiming that Google's [[web cache|caching]] of content on its site infringed its copyright for the content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1038_3-1024234.html |title=Google cache raises copyright concerns |last1=Olsen |first1=Stefanie |date=July 9, 2003 |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both ''[[Field v.

Google also hosts [[Google Books]]. The company began scanning books and uploading limited previews, and full books were allowed, into its new book search engine. The [[Authors Guild]], a group that represents 8,000 U.S. authors, filed a class action suit in a New York City federal court against Google in 2005 over this service. Google replied that it is in compliance with all existing and historical applications of copyright laws regarding books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=China |last=Martin |url=http://www.infoworld.com/t/platforms/google-hit-second-lawsuit-over-library-project-722 |title=Google hit with second lawsuit over Library project |publisher=[[InfoWorld]] |date=November 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google eventually reached a revised settlement in 2009 to limit its scans to books from the U.S., the UK, Australia, and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Pettersson, Edvard |title=Google Wins Preliminary Approval of Online Books Settlement |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ahUxORgasDFs |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67Qvo6uhf?url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ahUxORgasDFs |archivedate=May 5, 2012 |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=November 20, 2009 |accessdate=December 18, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Paris Civil Court ruled against Google in late 2009, asking it to remove the works of La Martinière ([[Éditions du Seuil]]) from its database.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{Cite news |author=Smith, Heather |title=Google's French Book Scanning Project Halted by Court |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=apZ3UG9CPLo8 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67QvoTecZ?url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=apZ3UG9CPLo8 |archivedate=May 5, 2012 |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=December 18, 2009 |accessdate=December 18, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In competition with [[Amazon.com]], Google sells digital versions of new books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Motoko |last=Rich |title=Preparing to Sell E-Books, Google Takes on Amazon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/technology/internet/01google.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 31, 2009 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 2010, in response to [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], Google updated its image search to display a streaming sequence of [[thumbnail]]s that enlarge when pointed at. Although web searches still appear in a batch per page format, on July 23, 2010, dictionary definitions for certain English words began appearing above the linked results for web searches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/this-week-in-search-72510.html |title=This Week in Search 7/25/10 |last1=Mayer |first1=Marissa |publisher=Google, Inc. |date=July 25, 2010 |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Hummingbird" update to the Google search engine was announced in September 2013. The update was introduced over the month prior to the announcement and allows users ask the search engine a question in natural language rather than entering keywords into the search box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google introduces the biggest algorithm change in three years |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/27/google-biggest-algorithm-change-hummingbird |accessdate=September 29, 2013 |newspaper=Guardian |date=September 27, 2013 |author=Samuel Gibbs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Google announced two major changes to its mobile search results. The first change removes the "mobile-friendly" label that highlighted easy to read pages from its mobile search results page. For the second change, the company—starting on January 10, 2017—will punish mobile pages that show intrusive [[interstitial ad]]vertisements when a user first opens a page. Such pages will also rank lower in Google search results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Frederic |last=Lardinois |title=Google will soon start punishing mobile sites that show hard-to-dismiss popups |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/23/good-riddance/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=August 23, 2016 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Google enabled a new "Personal" tab in Google Search, letting users search for content in their Google accounts' various services, including email messages from [[Gmail]] and photos from [[Google Photos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Barry |last=Schwartz |title=Google Adds Personal Tab To Search Filters |url=https://www.seroundtable.com/google-personal-tab-search-23912.html |website=Search Engine Roundtable |publisher=RustyBrick |date=May 26, 2017 |accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chaim |last=Gartenberg |title=Google adds new Personal tab to search results to show Gmail and Photos content |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/26/15701778/google-personal-tab-search-results-gmail-photos-images-maps-news-filter |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=May 26, 2017 |accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Innovation Time Off policy ===
{{Anchor|Innovation Time Off}}
As a motivation technique, Google uses a policy known as Innovation Time Off, where Google engineers are encouraged to spend 20% of their work time on projects that interest them. Some of Google's services, such as Gmail, Google News, [[Orkut]], and AdSense originated from these independent endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Bharat |last1=Mediratta |first2=Julie |last2=Bick |title=The Google Way: Give Engineers Room |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/jobs/21pre.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 21, 2007 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a talk at Stanford University, [[Marissa Mayer]], Google's Vice-President of Search Products and User Experience until July 2012, showed that half of all new product launches in the second half of 2005 had originated from the Innovation Time Off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video |people=Mayer, Marissa (speaker) |date=June 30, 2006 |title=Marissa Mayer at Stanford University |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soYKFWqVVzg |medium=Seminar |publisher=Martin Lafrance |accessdate=June 20, 2010 |time=11:33 |quote=Fifty percent of what Google launched in the second half of 2005 actually got built out of 20% time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 October 2018, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published the ''[[Investigative journalism|exposé]]'', "How Google Protected [[Andy Rubin]], the ‘Father of Android’". The company subsequently announced that "48 employees have been fired over the last two years" for sexual misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Welch |first1=Chris |title=Google says 48 people have been fired for sexual harassment in the last two years |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18024486/google-sexual-harassment-people-fired-rubin-2-years-ceo |accessdate=31 October 2018 |publisher=The Verge |date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week after the article appeared, [[Google X]] (renamed X Development LLC in 2015) executive Rich DeVaul resigned pursuant to  a complaint of [[sexual harassment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Musil |first1=Steven |title=Google exec accused of sexual harassment leaves company |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-exec-accused-of-sexual-harassment-leaves-company/ |accessdate=31 October 2018 |publisher=CNET |date=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google's employees are hired based on a hierarchical system.

Following the company's IPO in 2004, founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page and CEO Eric Schmidt requested that their [[One-dollar salary|base salary be cut to $1]]. Subsequent offers by the company to increase their salaries were turned down, primarily because their main compensation continues to come from owning stock in Google. Before 2004, Schmidt made $250,000 per year, and Page and Brin each received an annual salary of $150,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul R. |last=La Monica |title=Google leaders stick with $1 salary |url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/03/31/technology/google/index.htm |website=CNN Money |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=March 31, 2006 |accessdate=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, Google employees donated over $2 million to a crisis fund in support of [[refugees]]; the company matched the donation with an additional $2 million.

==== Mountain View ====
{{Main|Googleplex}}

Google's headquarters in [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], California is referred to as "the [[Googleplex]]", a play on words on the number [[googolplex]] and the headquarters itself being a ''complex'' of buildings. The lobby is decorated with a piano, [[lava lamp]]s, old server clusters, and a projection of search queries on the wall. The hallways are full of exercise balls and bicycles. Many employees have access to the corporate recreation center. Recreational amenities are scattered throughout the campus and include a workout room with weights and rowing machines, locker rooms, washers and dryers, a massage room, assorted video games, [[table football]], a baby grand piano, a billiard table, and ping pong. In addition to the recreation room, there are snack rooms stocked with various foods and drinks, with special emphasis placed on nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/corporate/culture.html |title=About the Googleplex |accessdate=March 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free food is available to employees 24/7, with the offerings provided by paid vending machines [[Pro rata|prorated]] based on and favoring those of better nutritional value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/life/print/2011/07/what-googles-famous-cafeterias-can-teach-us-about-health/241876/ |title=What Google's Famous Cafeterias Can Teach Us About Health |publisher=[[The Atlantic]] |author=[[Marion Nestle]] |date=July 2011 |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally, Google has over 78 offices in more than 50 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/locations/?region=north-america|title=Google: Our Offices|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has product research and development operations in cities around the world, namely [[Sydney]] (birthplace location of [[Google Maps]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sydney |url=https://careers.google.com/locations/sydney/ |website=Google Careers |accessdate=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[London]] (part of [[Android (operating system)|Android]] development).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=London |url=https://careers.google.com/locations/london/ |website=Google Careers |accessdate=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Google announced plans for a new [[London]] headquarter, a notable 1 million square foot office able to accommodate 4,500 employees. Recognized as one of the biggest ever commercial property acquisitions at the time of the deal's announcement in January,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Leo |last=Mirani |title=Inside Google's new 1-million-square-foot London office—three years before it's ready |url=https://qz.com/139794/inside-googles-new-1-million-square-foot-london-office-three-years-before-its-ready/ |website=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |publisher=[[Atlantic Media]] |date=November 1, 2013 |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google submitted plans for the new headquarter to the [[Camden London Borough Council|Camden Council]] in June 2017.

=== Doodles ===
{{Main|Google Doodle}}
{{As of|1998|since=y|post=,}} Google has been designing special, temporary alternate logos to place on their [[homepage]] intended to celebrate [[holiday]]s, events, achievements and people. The first Google [[Doodle]] was in honor of the [[Burning Man|Burning Man Festival]] of 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/doodle4google/history.html |title=Doodle 4 Google |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/doodles/burning-man-festival |title=Burning Man Festival |date=August 30, 1998 |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doodle was designed by [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]] to notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed. Subsequent Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor, until Larry and Sergey asked then-[[intern]] [[Dennis Hwang]] to design a logo for [[Bastille Day]] in 2000. From that point onward, Doodles have been organized and created by a team of employees termed "Doodlers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/12/meet-people-behind-google-doodles-logo |title=Meet the people behind the Google Doodles |publisher=The Guardian |date=April 12, 2014 |accessdate=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Easter eggs and April Fools' Day jokes ===
{{Main|List of Google April Fools' Day jokes|List of Google Easter eggs}}

Google has a tradition of creating [[April Fools' Day]] jokes. On April 1, 2000, [[Google's hoaxes#2000|Google MentalPlex]] allegedly featured the use of mental power to search the web.&lt;ref name="mentalplex"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/mentalplex/ |title=Google MentalPlex |date=April 1, 2000 |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Google announced a free Internet service called [[TiSP]], or Toilet Internet Service Provider, where one obtained a connection by flushing one end of a [[optical fiber|fiber-optic]] cable down their toilet.&lt;ref name="TiSP"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/tisp/ |title=Welcome to Google TiSP |date=April 1, 2007 |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2007, Google's Gmail page displayed an announcement for [[Gmail Paper]], allowing users to have email messages printed and shipped to them.&lt;ref name="gmail_paper"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mail.google.com/mail/help/paper/more.html |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20080315144610/http://mail.google.com/mail/help/paper/more.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 15, 2008 |title=Google Paper |date=April 1, 2000 |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, Google announced Gmail Custom time where users could change the time that the email was sent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://mail.google.com/mail/help/customtime/index.html |title=Gmail Custom Time: Google makes custom time |date=April 14, 2011 |publisher=Google |accessdate=April 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Google changed its company name to Topeka in honor of [[Topeka, Kansas]], whose mayor changed the city's name to Google for a short amount of time in an attempt to sway Google's decision in its new [[Google Fiber|Google Fiber Project]].&lt;ref name="Google Blog: A Different Kind of Company Name"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/different-kind-of-company-name.html |title=A different kind of company name |last1=Schmidt |first1=Eric |date=April 1, 2010 |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/04/01/business/main6353136.shtml |title=April Fools: Google Changes Name to Topeka |date=April 1, 2010 |publisher=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Google announced [[Gmail Motion]], an interactive way of controlling Gmail and the computer with body movements via the user's webcam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/216708/technology/googles-gmail-motion-launched-april-1 |title=Google's GMail Motion launched April 1 |date=April 1, 2011 |publisher=[[GMA News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google's services contain [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]], such as the [[Swedish Chef]]'s "Bork bork bork," [[Pig Latin]], "Hacker" or [[leet]]speak, [[Elmer Fudd]], [[International Talk Like a Pirate Day|Pirate]], and [[Klingon language|Klingon]] as language selections for its search engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/language_tools |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hT77QDRS?url=http://www.google.com/language_tools |archivedate=June 12, 2009 |title=Language Tools |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The search engine calculator provides the [[Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything]] from [[Douglas Adams]]' ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/search?q=answer+to+life+the+universe+and+everything |title=Google Search Results for 'answer to life the universe and everything' |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When searching the word "recursion", the spell-checker's result for the properly spelled word is exactly the same word, creating a recursive link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/search?q=recursion |title=Google Search Results for 'recursion' |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When searching for the word "[[anagram]]," meaning a rearrangement of letters from one word to form other valid words, Google's suggestion feature displays "Did you mean: nag a ram?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/search?q=anagram |title=anagram search |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Google Maps, searching for directions between places separated by large bodies of water, such as Los Angeles and Tokyo, results in instructions to "[[kayak]] across the [[Pacific Ocean]]." During [[FIFA World Cup 2010]], search queries including "[[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]" and "[[FIFA]]" caused the "Goooo...gle" page indicator at the bottom of every result page to read "Goooo...al!" instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asia.cnet.com/crave/google-celebrates-world-cup-with-gooooooooooal-62111461.htm |title=Google celebrates World Cup with Gooooooooooal! |website=CNET Asia |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=May 18, 2011 |author=Chan, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philanthropy ===
{{Main|Google.org}}

In 2004, Google formed the not-for-profit philanthropic [[Google.org]], with a start-up fund of $1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="philanthropy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.org/about.html |title=About the Foundation |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714080922/http://www.google.org/about.html |archivedate=July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the organization is to create awareness about [[climate change]], global public health, and global poverty. One of its first projects was to develop a viable [[plug-in hybrid]] [[electric vehicle]] that can attain 100 miles per gallon. Google hired [[Larry Brilliant]] as the program's executive director in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Katie |last=Hafner |title=Philanthropy Google's Way: Not the Usual |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/14/technology/14google.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 14, 2006 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Megan Smith has {{as of|2009|2|23|alt=since}} replaced him has director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Miguel |last=Helft |title=Google Chief for Charity Steps Down on Revamp |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/technology/companies/24google.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 23, 2009 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Google announced its "project 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;" which accepted ideas for how to help the community and then allowed Google users to vote on their favorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.project10tothe100.com/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hT8OddCZ?url=http://www.project10tothe100.com/ |archivedate=June 12, 2009 |title=Project 10 to the 100th |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After two years of silence, during which many wondered what had happened to the program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/06/google-struggles-to-give-away-10-million/ |title=Google Struggles to Give Away $10&amp;nbsp;million |last1=Van Burskirk |first1=Elliot |date=June 28, 2010 |work=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |accessdate=September 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google revealed the winners of the project, giving a total of ten million dollars to various ideas ranging from non-profit organizations that promote education to a website that intends to make all legal documents public and online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/09/10-million-for-project-10100-winners.html |title=$10&amp;nbsp;million for Project 10^100 winners |date=September 24, 2010 |last1=Twohill |first1=Lorraine |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=September 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, in partnership with the [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]] (MSRI), Google hosted the first [[Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival]] at its headquarters in Mountain View.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDL7yoz1TGQ The 2007 [[Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival]] at Google was the founding of this event for middle school and high school students.] video&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Google donated 1&amp;nbsp;million euros to [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] to support the next five annual International Mathematical Olympiads (2011–2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jill |last=Duffy |title=Mathletes Receive €1M Donation from Google |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2376099,00.asp |website=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=January 21, 2011 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imo2011.nl/node/39 |title=Google donating 1&amp;nbsp;million euros to IMO |date=January 20, 2011 |accessdate=February 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724154518/https://www.imo2011.nl/node/39 |archivedate=July 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, Google launched a "[[Legalize Love]]" campaign in support of [[gay rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/07/08/google-launches-legalise-love-gay-rights-campaign/ |title=Google launches 'Legalise Love' gay rights campaign |website=PinkNews.co.uk |accessdate=September 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tax avoidance ===
{{Further|Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Multinational tax schemes}}

Google uses various [[Tax avoidance|tax avoidance strategies]]. Out of the [[List of the largest information technology companies|five largest American technology companies]], it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues. Google between 2007 and 2010 saved $3.1 billion in taxes by shuttling non-U.S. profits through [[Ireland]] and the [[Netherlands]] and then to [[Bermuda]]. Such techniques lower its non-U.S. tax rate to 2.3 per cent, while normally the corporate tax rate in for instance the UK is 28 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Metz |first=Cade |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/10/22/google_double_irish_tax_loophole/ |title=Google slips $3.1bn through 'Double Irish' tax loophole. |publisher=The Register |date=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google's [[transfer pricing]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Leach |first=Anna |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/31/google_france_tax_office_billion_euros/ |title=French gov 'plans to hand Google €1bn tax bill'&amp;nbsp;– report |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=October 31, 2012 |accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following criticism of the amount of corporate taxes that Google paid in the United Kingdom, Chairman Eric Schmidt said, "It's called capitalism. We are proudly capitalistic." During the same December 2012 interview, Schmidt confirmed that the company had no intention of paying more to the UK exchequer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/google-boss-im-very-proud-of-our-tax-avoidance-scheme-8411974.html |title=Google boss: I'm very proud of our tax avoidance scheme |last1=Kumar |first1=Nikhil |last2=Wright |first2=Oliver |date=December 13, 2012 |publisher=The Independent |accessdate=December 17, 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google Vice-President [[Matt Brittin]] testified to the [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] of the UK House of Commons that his UK sales team made no sales and hence owed no sales taxes to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Brid-Aine Parnell, May 17, 2013 |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/05/17/quotw_ending_may_17/ |title='I think you DO do evil, using smoke and mirrors to avoid tax' |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=May 17, 2013 |accessdate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay £130m in back taxes plus higher taxes in future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=John Gapper, January 23, 2016 |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d50ad5f4-c125-11e5-9fdb-87b8d15baec2.html |title=Google strikes £130m back tax deal |publisher=FT.com |accessdate=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environment ===
{{As of|2007|since=y|post=,}} Google has aimed for carbon neutrality in regard to its operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jack |last=McGrath |title=Google's Green Initiative: Environmentally Conscious Technology |url=http://www.technobuffalo.com/2011/05/18/googles-green-initiative-environmentally-conscious-technology/ |publisher=''TechnoBuffalo'' |date=May 18, 2011 |accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google disclosed in September 2011 that it "continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes", almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant. Total carbon emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, mostly due to fossil fuels that provide electricity for the data centers. Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010. An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5 million watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Glanz |title=Google Details, and Defends, Its Use of Electricity |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/technology/google-details-and-defends-its-use-of-electricity.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 8, 2011 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Google launched a project centered on developing renewable energy, titled the "Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal (RE&lt;C)" project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google's Goal: Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal |url=http://googlepress.blogspot.no/2007/11/googles-goal-renewable-energy-cheaper_27.html |date=November 27, 2007 |accessdate=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project was canceled in 2014, after engineers Ross Koningstein and David Fork understood, after years of study, that "best-case scenario, which was based on our most optimistic forecasts for renewable energy, would still result in severe climate change", writing that they "came to the conclusion that even if Google and others had led the way toward a wholesale adoption of renewable energy, that switch would not have resulted in significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Ross |last1=Koningstein |first2=David |last2=Fork |title=What It Would Really Take to Reverse Climate Change |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/what-it-would-really-take-to-reverse-climate-change |publisher=''IEEE Spectrum'' |date=November 18, 2014 |accessdate=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, ''The Washington Post'' reported that Google had donated $50,000 to the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]], a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[think tank]] that calls human carbon emissions a positive factor in the environment and argues that global warming is not a concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anatomy of a Washington dinner: Who funds the Competitive Enterprise Institute? |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/06/20/anatomy-of-a-washington-dinner-who-funds-the-competitive-enterprise-institute/ |accessdate=July 12, 2013 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=June 20, 2013 |author=Juliet Eilperin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, it was reported that Google had hosted a fundraising event for Oklahoma Senator [[Jim Inhofe]], who has called climate change a "hoax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google hosts fundraiser for climate change denying US senator |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jul/09/google-climate-denier-jim-inhofe |accessdate=July 12, 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=July 9, 2013 |author=Suzanne Goldenberg |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Google cut ties with the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC) after pressure from the Sierra Club, major unions and Google's own scientists because of ALEC's stance on climate change and opposition to renewable energy.&lt;ref name=LA&gt;{{cite news |title=Google pulls out of conservative group amid environmentalist pressure |author=EVAN HALPER |date=September 23, 2014 |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-google-gop-20140924-story.html |accessdate=October 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Google bought 536 megawatts of wind power. The purchase made the firm reach 100% renewable energy. The wind energy comes from two power plants in South Dakota, one in Iowa and one in Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fortune.com/2017/12/01/google-clean-energy/ |title= Google Just Bought Enough Wind Power to Run 100% On Renewable Energy |date= November 30, 2017 |author= Grace Donnelly |work= Fortune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lobbying ===
In 2013, Google ranked 5th in [[Lobbying in the United States|lobbying]] spending, up from 213th in 2003. In 2012, the company ranked 2nd in campaign donations of technology and Internet sections.&lt;ref name=lobby1&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-google-is-transforming-power-and-politicsgoogle-once-disdainful-of-lobbying-now-a-master-of-washington-influence/2014/04/12/51648b92-b4d3-11e3-8cb6-284052554d74_story.html |title=Google, once disdainful of lobbying, now a master of Washington influence |work=[[The Washington Post]] |first1=Tom |last1=Hamburger |first2=Matea |last2=Gold |date=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Litigation ===
{{main|Google litigation}}

Google has been involved in a number of lawsuits including the [[High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation]] which resulted in Google being one of four companies to pay a $415 million settlement to employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosenblatt |first=Joel |title=Apple-Google $415 Million No-Poaching Accord Wins Approval |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-02/tech-no-poaching-settlement-gets-judge-s-preliminary-approval |accessdate=January 24, 2016 |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 2017, the company received a record fine of {{€|2.42 billion|link=yes}} from the [[European Union]] for "promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40406542 |title=Google hit with record EU fine over Shopping service |first=Leo |last=Kelion |date=June 27, 2017 |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the penalty, ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine said: "The hefty sum – the largest ever doled out by the EU's competition regulators – will sting in the short term, but Google can handle it. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, made a profit of $2.5 billion (€2.2 billion) in the first six weeks of 2017 alone. The real impact of the ruling is that Google must stop using its dominance as a search engine to give itself the edge in another market: online price comparisons." The company disputed the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2139097-googles-e2-4bn-fine-is-small-change-the-eu-has-bigger-plans/ |title=Google's €2.4bn fine is small change – the EU has bigger plans |publisher=newscientist.com |accessdate=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google's market dominance has led to prominent media coverage, including [[Criticism of Google|criticism of the company]] over issues such as [[Google tax avoidance|aggressive tax avoidance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jesse |last=Drucker |title=Google 2.4% Rate Shows How $60 Billion Is Lost to Tax Loopholes |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-10-21/google-2-4-rate-shows-how-60-billion-u-s-revenue-lost-to-tax-loopholes |website=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=October 21, 2010 |accessdate=January 22, 2017}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Criticism of Google#Page rank|search neutrality]], [[Criticism of Google#Copyright issues|copyright]], [[censorship by Google|censorship]] of search results and content,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/magazine/the-case-against-google.html |title=The Case Against Google |website=nytimes.com |date=February 20, 2018 |accessdate=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Google privacy|privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6740075.stm |work=BBC News |title=Google ranked 'worst' on privacy |date=June 11, 2007 |accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jeffrey |last=Rosen |title=Google's Gatekeepers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/magazine/30google-t.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 28, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other criticisms include alleged misuse and manipulation of search results, its use of others' [[intellectual property]], concerns that its [[Data collection|compilation of data]] may violate people's [[Internet privacy|privacy]], and the [[energy consumption]] of its servers, as well as concerns over traditional business issues such as [[monopoly]], [[restraint of trade]], [[anti-competitive practices]], and [[patent infringement]].

Google adhered to the [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|Internet censorship policies of China]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4645596.stm|title=Google censors itself for China|last=|first=|date=January 25, 2006|work=|publisher=BBC News|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; enforced by means of filters colloquially known as "The [[Great Firewall of China]]". ''The Intercept'' reported in August 2018 that Google is developing for the people's Republic of China a censored version of its search engine (known as [[Dragonfly (search engine)|Dragonfly]]) "that will blacklist websites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google Plans to Launch Censored Search Engine in China, Leaked Documents Reveal · Ryan Gallagher |url=https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/google-china-search-engine-censorship/ |work=The Intercept |date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Disis |first=Jill|title=Google grilled over 'Project Dragonfly' at Senate hearing on data privacy |date=26 September 2018 |newspaper=CNN |url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/26/technology/google-dragonfly-senate-hearing/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926222719/https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/26/technology/google-dragonfly-senate-hearing/index.html |archive-date=26 September 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google's [[mission statement]], from the outset, was "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Samuel |last=Gibbs |title=Google has 'outgrown' its 14-year old mission statement, says Larry Page |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/03/larry-page-google-dont-be-evil-sergey-brin |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=November 3, 2014 |accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its unofficial slogan is "[[Don't be evil]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google Code of Conduct |url=https://abc.xyz/investor/other/google-code-of-conduct.html |website=Alphabet Investor Relations |publisher=[[Alphabet Inc.]] |date=April 11, 2012 |accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, a related motto was adopted in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: "Do the right thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Lawler |title=Alphabet replaces Google's 'Don't be evil' with 'Do the right thing' |url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/10/02/alphabet-do-the-right-thing/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=October 2, 2015 |accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original motto was retained in the code of conduct of Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abc.xyz/investor/other/google-code-of-conduct.html|title=Google Code of Conduct|publisher=Alphabet|accessdate=August 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google's commitment to such robust idealism has been increasingly called into doubt due to a number of the firm's actions and behaviors which appear to contradict this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Holly |last=Baxter |title=Who's more evil – Facebook or Google? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/25/evil-facebook-google-beheading-email-abuse |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=October 25, 2013 |accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Roxane |last=Gay |title=The Blog That Disappeared |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/30/opinion/sunday/the-blog-that-disappeared.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 29, 2016 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following media reports about [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], NSA's massive electronic [[Mass surveillance|surveillance program]], in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Edward Snowden: Leaks that exposed US spy programme |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-23123964 |website=[[BBC News]] |date=January 17, 2014 |accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to leaks of said program, Google joined the PRISM program in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Glenn |last1=Greenwald |first2=Ewen |last2=MacAskill |title=NSA Prism program taps in to user data of Apple, Google and others |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=June 7, 2013 |accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 8, 2017, Google fired employee James Damore after he distributed [[Google memo|a memo]] throughout the company which argued that "Google's ideological echo chamber" and bias clouded their thinking about diversity and inclusion, and that it is also biological factors, not discrimination alone, that cause the average woman to be less interested than men in technical positions.&lt;ref name=NYTFired&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/business/google-women-engineer-fired-memo.html Google Fires Engineer Who Wrote Memo Questioning Women in Tech].

Reportedly, Google's influenced [[New America (organization)|New America]] think tank to expel their Open Markets research group, after the group has criticized Google monopolistic power and supported the [[European Union vs. Google|EU $2.7B fine of Google]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Vogel |first=Kenneth P. | author-link = Kenneth Vogel |title=Google Critic Ousted From Think Tank Funded by the Tech Giant |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |pages=A1  |date=August 31, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/us/politics/eric-schmidt-google-new-america.html | access-date = September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://citizensagainstmonopoly.org/ |title=Tell Google: Stop Killing Monopoly Research |website=citizensagainstmonopoly.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google has worked with the [[United States Department of Defense]] on drone software through the 2017 "Project Maven" that could be used to improve the accuracy of [[drone strike]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/04/google-should-not-be-in-the-business-of-war-googlers-decry-pentagon-project/ Google employees revolt, say company should shut down military drone project]". ''[[Ars Technica]]''. April 4, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Google employees, including senior engineers, have signed a letter urging Google CEO [[Sundar Pichai]] to end a controversial contract with the Pentagon.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/google-protest-pentagon-drones-programme-company-sundar-pichai-department-of-defense-a8290111.html Google staff protest company's involvement with Pentagon drones programme]". ''The Independent''. April 4, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the backlash, Google ultimately decided to not review their DoD contract, set to expire in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Wakabayashi, Daisuke |author2=Shane, Scott |title=Google Will Not Renew Pentagon Contract That Upset Employees |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/technology/google-pentagon-project-maven.html |website=nytimes.com |publisher=The New York Times Company |accessdate=16 October 2018 |date=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal controversies ===
In 2017, David Elliot and Chris Gillespie argued before the [[Ninth Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals]] that "google" had suffered [[genericide]]. The controversy began in 2012 when Gillespie acquired 763 domain names containing the word "google." Google promptly filed a complaint with the [[National Arbitration Forum]] (NAF). Elliot then filed a petition for canceling the Google trademark. Ultimately, the court ruled in favor of Google because Elliot failed to show a preponderance of evidence showing the genericide of "google."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/15-15809/15-15809-2017-05-16.html|title=Elliott v.
