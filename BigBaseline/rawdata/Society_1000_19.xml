'''Gil Alberto Enríquez Gallo''' (24 July 1894 &amp;ndash; 13 July 1962) was [[List of heads of state of Ecuador|President]] of [[Ecuador]] 1937&amp;ndash;1938.

Enriquez was appointed as a general in the Ecuadorian army by [[Federico Páez]], and served as Minister of Defense in his government. In September 1937, he overthrew Páez in a military coup.  Although he ruled for less than a year, Enríquez achieved note as a social reformer by his promulgation of the Labor Code of 1938.

Enríquez is also remembered for having initiated a protracted confrontation with the United States-based South American Development Company over the terms of its Ecuadorian concession and the wages it paid its Ecuadorian employees.  The company refused to comply with Enríquez's entreaty that more of the profits from its mining operations stay in Ecuador, and it won the support of the United States Department of State.

'''Animal studies''' is a recently recognized field in which animals are studied in a variety of cross-disciplinary ways. Scholars who engage in animal studies may be formally trained in a number of diverse fields, including [[geography]], [[art history]], [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[film studies]], [[geography]], [[history]], [[psychology]], [[literary studies]], [[museology]], [[philosophy]], communication, and [[sociology]]. They may engage with questions about literal animals, or about notions of "animality" or "brutality," employing various theoretical perspectives, including [[feminism]], [[Marxist theory]], and [[queer theory]]. Using these perspectives, those who engage in animal studies seek to understand both human-animal relations now and in the past, and to understand animals as beings-in-themselves, separate from our knowledge of them. Because the field is still developing, scholars and others have some freedom to define their own criteria about what issues may structure the field.

==History==
As an interdisciplinary subject, animal studies exists at the intersection of a number of different fields of study. Different fields began to turn to animals as an important topic at different times and for various reasons, and these separate disciplinary histories shape how scholars approach animal studies.

In part, animal studies developed out of the [[animal liberation movement]] and was grounded in [[ethics|ethical]] questions about co-existence with other species: whether it is moral to eat animals, to do scientific research on animals for human benefit, and so on. Animal studies scholars who explore the field from an ethical perspective frequently cite [[Australian]] philosopher [[Peter Singer]]'s 1975 work, ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'',&lt;ref name="Gorman"&gt;{{cite web |author=Gorman, James |date=12 January 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/science/animal-studies-move-from-the-lab-to-the-lecture-hall.html?pagewanted=all |title=Animal Studies Move From the Lab to the Lecture Hall |publisher=The New York Times |access-date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a founding document in animal studies.  Singer's work followed [[Jeremy Bentham#Animal rights|Jeremy Bentham]]'s by trying to expand [[utilitarian]] questions about pleasure and pain beyond humans to other [[sentience|sentient]] creatures.

Theorists interested in the role of animals in literature, culture, and [[Continental philosophy]] also consider the late work of [[Jacques Derrida]] a driving force behind the rise of interest in animal studies in the humanities.&lt;ref name="Gorman" /&gt;  Derrida's final lecture series, ''The Animal That Therefore I Am'', examined how interactions with animal life affect human attempts to define humanity and the self through language. Taking up Derrida's deconstruction and extending it to other cultural territory, [[Cary Wolfe]] published ''Animal Rites'' in 2003 and critiqued earlier animal rights philosophers such as [[Peter Singer]] and Thomas Regan. Wolfe's study points out an insidious humanism at play in their philosophies and others. Recently also the Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] published a book on the question of the animal: ''The Open. Man and Animal''.

==Research topics and methodologies==
Researchers in animal studies examine the questions and issues that arise when traditional modes of [[Humanities|humanistic]] and [[Science|scientific]] inquiry begin to take animals seriously as subjects of thought and activity.  Students of animal studies may examine how humanity is defined in relation to animals, or how representations of animals create understandings (and misunderstandings) of other species. In order to do so, animal studies pays close attention to the ways that humans [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]] animals, and asks how humans might avoid bias in observing other creatures. For instance, [[Donna Haraway]]'s book, ''Primate Visions'', examines how [[diorama]]s created for the [[American Museum of Natural History]] showed family groupings that conformed to the traditional human [[nuclear family]], which misrepresented the animals' observed behavior in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Donna |last=Haraway |authorlink=Donna_Haraway |jstor=466593 |title=Teddy Bear Patriarchy: Taxidermy in the Garden of Eden, New York City, 1908–1936 |journal=Social Text |issue=11 |date=Winter 1984–1985 |pages=20–64 |publisher=Duke University Press |doi = 10.2307/466593}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical approaches in animal studies have also considered representations of non-human animals in popular culture, including species diversity in animated films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Becoming-Animal Is A Trap For Humans |first=Timothy |last=Laurie |journal=Deleuze and the Non-Human |year=2015 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10912960}}, eds. Hannah Stark and Jon Roffe.&lt;/ref&gt;

By highlighting these issues, animal studies strives to re-examine traditional [[Ethics|ethical]], [[Politics|political]], and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] categories in the context of a renewed attention to and respect for animal life. The assumption that focusing on animals might clarify human knowledge is neatly expressed in [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s famous dictum that animals are "good to think."&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude. ''Totemism''. Boston: Beacon Press, 1963, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3898">An '''Aonach''' or '''Óenach''' was an ancient [[Ireland|Irish]] public national assembly called upon the death of a [[king]], [[Queen regnant|queen]], notable [[Wise old man|sage]] or [[warrior]] as part of [[ancestor worship]] practices.&lt;ref name="Nally2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=T. H.

The Aonach had three functions; honoring the dead, proclaiming [[law]]s, and funeral games and festivities to entertain. The first function took between one and three days depending on the importance of the deceased, guests would sing mourning chants called the ''[[Guba (chant)|Guba]]'' after which [[druid]]s would improvise songs in memory of the dead called a ''[[Cepóg]]''. The dead would then be burnt on a [[funeral pyre]]. The second function would then be carried out by the [[Ollamh Érenn]], giving out laws to the people via bards and druids and culminating in the igniting of another massive fire. The custom of rejoicing after a funeral was then enshrined in the ''[[Cuiteach Fuait]]'', games of mental and physical ability accompanied by a large market for traders. 

The most notable fair, that held under the auspices of the [[High King of Ireland]] and the [[Uí Néill]], was the ''Óenach Tailten'' or "[[Tailteann Games (ancient)|Tailteann Games]]", which is given [[prehistoric]] origins by medieval writers. This was held at [[Teltown]], in modern [[County Meath]], as late as 1770. The compilers of the [[Irish annals]] considered violence and disorders at this óenach, or the failure of the incumbent High King to hold the fair, to be of note. The [[Irish Free State]] held [[Tailteann Games (Irish Free State)|revivals of the Tailteann Games]] from 1924 to 1932. 

Other important assemblies included that of [[Tlachtga]], held on the [[Hill of Ward]] at [[Samhain]], that of [[Carman]], held in [[County Wexford]], that of [[Uisnech]], held at [[Beltane]] and that of Raigne in [[Kingdom of Ossory|Osraige]]. Not all had pagan calendrical associations. The ''Óenach Colmáin'', probably held at [[Lynally]], was named for Saint [[Elo Colman]].

'''Appreciative inquiry''' ('''AI''') is a model that seeks to engage stakeholders in self-determined change. According to Bushe "AI revolutionized the field of organization development and was a precursor to the rise of positive organization studies and the strengths based movement in American management."&lt;ref&gt;Bushe, G.R. (2013) The appreciative inquiry model.  In E.H. Kessler, (ed.) Encyclopedia of Management Theory, (Volume 1, pp. 41-44), Sage Publications, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed at [[Case Western Reserve University]]'s department of [[organizational behavior]], starting with a 1987 article by [[David Cooperrider]] and Suresh Srivastva.  They felt that the overuse of "problem solving" hampered any kind of social improvement, and what was needed were new methods of inquiry that would help generate new ideas and models for how to organize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cooperrider, D. L.|author2=Srivastva, S.|year=1987|chapter=Appreciative inquiry in organizational life|editor1=Woodman, R. W.|editor2=Pasmore, W.A.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Research in Organizational Change And Development|volume=Vol. 1|pages=129–169|location=Stamford, CT|publisher=JAI Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Cooperrider and Srivastva took a social constructionist approach, arguing that organizations are created, maintained and changed by conversations, and claiming that methods of organizing were only limited by people's imaginations and the agreements among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cooperrider, D. L.|author2=Barrett, F.|author3=Srivastva, S.|year=1995|contribution=Social construction and appreciative inquiry: A journey in organizational theory|editor1=Hosking, D.|editor2=Dachler, P.|editor3=Gergen, K.|title=Management and Organization: Relational Alternatives to Individualism|pages=157–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Cooperrider and [[Diana Whitney]] published an article outlining the five principles of AI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cooperrider, D.L. |author2=Whitney, D|year=2001|chapter=A positive revolution in change|editor1=Cooperrider, D. L.|editor2=Sorenson, P.|editor3=Whitney, D.|editor4=Yeager, T.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Appreciative Inquiry: An Emerging Direction for Organization Development|pages=9–29|location=Champaign, IL|publisher=Stipes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Cooperrider, Whitney and several of their colleagues became centrally involved using AI to mid-wife the creation of the United Religions Initiative, a global organization dedicated to promoting grassroots interfaith cooperation for peace, justice and healing. This early partnership between URI and AI is chronicled in Birth of a Global Community: Appreciative Inquiry in Action by Charles Gibbs and Sally Mahé.  AI was also used in the first (1999) and subsequent meetings of business leaders that created the UN's Global Compact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://appreciativeinquiry.case.edu/intro/commentFeb05.cfm|title=Current Commentary on AI and Positive Change|author=Cooperrider, David|work=AI Commons|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another of the early applications, Cooperrider and Whitney taught AI to employees of GTE (now part of Verizon) resulting in improvements in employees' support for GTE's business direction and. as a part of continuous process improvement generated both improvements in revenue collection and cost savings earning GTE an [[ASTD]] award for the best organisational change program in the US in 1997."&lt;ref name="Bushe 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bushe, G.R.|author2=Kassam, A.|year=2005|title=When is appreciative inquiry transformational?  A meta-case analysis|journal=Journal of Applied Behavioral Science|volume=41|issue=2|pages=161–181|displayauthors=etal|url=http://www.gervasebushe.ca/ai-meta.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|176}}

On May 8, 2010, Suresh Srivastva died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taosinstitute.net/suresh-srviastva|title=Suresh Srviastva|work=The Taos Institute|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gervase Bushe, a researcher on the topic, published a 2011 review of the model, including its processes, critiques, and evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bushe, G. R.|layurl=http://www.gervasebushe.ca/AITC.pdf|chapter=Appreciative Inquiry: Theory and Critique|year=2011|editor1=Boje, D.|editor2=Burnes, B. |editor3=Hassard, J.|title=The Routledge Companion To Organizational Change |pages=87–103|location=Oxford, UK|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also published a history of the model in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.gervasebushe.ca/Foundations_AI.pdf|title = Foundations of Appreciative Inquiry|date = 2012|website = Bushe's website|publisher = Appreciative Practitioner|last = Bushe|first = Gervase}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis and principles ==

According to Bushe, AI "advocates collective inquiry into the best of what is, in order to imagine what could be, followed by collective design of a desired future state that is compelling and thus, does not require the use of incentives, coercion or persuasion for planned change to occur."&lt;ref name="Bushe, G.R. 2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bushe, G.R.|year=2013|url=http://www.gervasebushe.ca/the_AI_model.pdf|title=The Appreciative Inquiry Model|editor= Kessler, E.|work=The Encyclopedia of Management Theory|publisher= Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model is based on the assumption that the questions we ask will tend to focus our attention in a particular direction, that organizations evolve in the direction of the questions they most persistently and passionately ask.&lt;ref&gt;Cooperrider, D.L. &amp; Whitney, D (2005) A positive revolution in change: Appreciative inquiry. In Cooperrider, D. L. Sorenson, P., Yeager, T. &amp; Whitney, D. (eds.) Appreciative Inquiry: Foundations in Positive Organization Development (pp.9-33).  Champaign, IL: Stipes.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 80's most methods of assessing and evaluating a situation and then proposing solutions were based on a ''deficiency'' model, predominantly asking questions such as "What are the problems?", "What's wrong?" or "What needs to be fixed?".  Instead of asking "What's the problem?", others couched the question in terms of "challenges", which still focused on deficiency, on what needs to be fixed or solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Case Western Reserve University's Weatherhead School of Management|url=http://appreciativeinquiry.case.edu/|title=The Appreciative Inquiry Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Appreciative Inquiry was the first serious managerial method to refocus attention on what works, the positive core, and on what people really care about.  Today, these ways of approaching organizational change are common&lt;ref&gt;Bushe, G.R. &amp; Marhsak, R.M. (2015) ''Dialogic Organization Development: The Theory and Practice of Organizational Transformation.''  Oakdland, CA: Berrett-Koehler.&lt;/ref&gt;

The five principles of AI are:&lt;ref name="Bushe, G.R. 2013" /&gt;
# The ''constructionist principle'' proposes that what we believe to be true determines what we do, and thought and action emerge from relationships.  Through the language and discourse of day to day interactions, people co-construct the organizations they inhabit.  The purpose of inquiry is to stimulate new ideas, stories and images that generate new possibilities for action.
# The ''principle of simultaneity'' proposes that as we inquire into human systems we change them and the seeds of change, the things people think and talk about, what they discover and learn, are implicit in the very first questions asked.  Questions are never neutral, they are fateful, and social systems move in the direction of the questions they most persistently and passionately discuss.
# The ''poetic principle'' proposes that organizational life is expressed in the stories people tell each other every day, and the story of the organization is constantly being co-authored.  The words and topics chosen for inquiry have an impact far beyond just the words themselves.  They invoke sentiments, understandings, and worlds of meaning. In all phases of the inquiry effort is put into using words that point to, enliven and inspire the best in people.
# The ''anticipatory principle'' posits that what we do today is guided by our image of the future.  Human systems are forever projecting ahead of themselves a horizon of expectation that brings the future powerfully into the present as a mobilizing agent. Appreciative inquiry uses artful creation of positive imagery on a collective basis to refashion anticipatory reality.
# The ''positive principle'' proposes that momentum and sustainable change requires positive affect and social bonding.  Sentiments like hope, excitement, inspiration, camaraderie and joy increase creativity, openness to new ideas and people, and cognitive flexibility.  They also promote the strong connections and relationships between people, particularly between groups in conflict, required for collective inquiry and change.

Some researchers believe that excessive focus on dysfunctions can actually cause them to become worse or fail to become better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wallis, Claudia|date=January 17, 2005|work=Time Magazine|title=The Science of Happiness|url=http://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/images/TimeMagazine/Time-Happiness.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060711093607/http://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/images/timemagazine/Time-Happiness.pdf|archivedate=July 11, 2006 |deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, AI argues, when all members of an organization are motivated to understand and value the most favourable features of its culture, it can make rapid improvements.&lt;ref name="new-paradigm.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Background|url=http://www.new-paradigm.co.uk/Appreciative.htm|work=New Paradigm|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strength-based methods are used in the creation of organizational development strategy and implementation of organizational effectiveness tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mt-online.com/component/content/article/77-february2007/228-building-strength-based-organizations.html|title=Building Strength-Based Organizations|first=Scott|last=Franklin|date=February 1, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928205741/http://www.mt-online.com/component/content/article/77-february2007/228-building-strength-based-organizations.html|archivedate=September 28, 2011|deadurl=y|work=Maintenance Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''appreciative'' mode of inquiry often relies on interviews to qualitatively understand the organization's potential strengths by looking at an organization's experience and its potential; the objective is to elucidate the assets and personal motivations that are its strengths.

Bushe has argued that mainstream proponents of AI focus too much attention on "the positive" and not enough on the transformation that AI can bring about through generating new ideas and the will to act on them.&lt;ref name="Bushe 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bushe, G.R.|year=2007|title=Appreciative inquiry is not (just) about the positive|journal=Organization Development Practitioner|volume=39|issue=4|pages=30–35|url=http://www.gervasebushe.ca/AI_pos.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.gervasebushe.ca/AI_generativity.pdf|title=Generative process, generative outcome: The transformational potential of appreciative inquiry|last=|first=|work=Organizational Generativity: The Appreciative Inquiry Summit and a Scholarship of Transformation|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|year=2013|isbn=|series=Advances in Appreciative Inquiry|volume=4|location=Bingley, UK|pages=|via=|author=Bushe, G.R.|editor1=D.L. Cooperrider|editor2=D.P. Zandee|editor3=L.N. Godwin|editor4=M. Avital|editor5=B. Boland|pp=89–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2010 comparative study in a school district he found that even in cases where no change occurred participants were highly positive during the AI process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bushe, G.R.|year=2010|url=http://www.gervasebushe.ca/comparative_case.pdf|title=A comparative case study of appreciative inquiries in one organization: Implications for practice|journal=Revista de Cercetare si Interventie Sociala / Review of Research and Social Intervention|series=Special Issue on Appreciative Inquiry|volume=29|pages=7–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  What distinguished those sites that experienced transformational changes was the creation of new ideas that gave people new ways to address old problems.  He argues that for transformational change to occur, AI must address problems that concern people enough to want to change.  However, AI addresses them not through problem-solving, but through generative images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bushe, G.R.|year=2013|title= Dialogic OD: A theory of practice|journal=Organization Development Practitioner, special issue on advances in Dialogic Organization Development|volume=45|issue=1|pages= 10–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this is covered in a 90-minute discussion about AI, positivity and generativity by Bushe and Dr. Ron Fry of Case Western, at the 2012 World Appreciative Inquiry Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Webcast Plenary Session 6: Prof. Dr. Ronald Fry and Prof. Dr. Gervase Bushe|url=http://www.2012waic.com/webcast-plenary-session-6-prof-dr-ronald-fry-and-prof-dr-gervase-bushe/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinguishing features ==

The following table comes from the Cooperrider and Whitney (2001){{full|date=September 2018}} article and is used to describe some of the distinctions between AI and approaches to organizational development not based on what they call positive potential:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Case Western Reserve University|work=Appreciative Inquiry Commons|url=http://appreciativeinquiry.case.edu/intro/whatisai.cfm|title=What is Appreciative Inquiry?|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appreciative inquiry attempts to use ways of asking questions and envisioning the future in order to foster positive relationships and build on the present potential of a given person, organization or situation.  The most common model utilizes a cycle of four processes, which focus on what it calls:
#''DISCOVER:'' The identification of organizational processes that work well.
#''DREAM:'' The envisioning of processes that would work well in the future.
#''DESIGN:'' Planning and prioritizing processes that would work well.
#''DESTINY'' (or ''DEPLOY''): The implementation (execution) of the proposed design.&lt;ref name="new-paradigm.co.uk"/&gt;

The aim is to build – or rebuild – organizations around what works, rather than trying to fix what doesn't. AI practitioners try to convey this approach as the opposite of problem solving.

==Implementing AI==

There are a variety of approaches to implementing appreciative inquiry, including mass-mobilised interviews and a large, diverse gathering called an Appreciative Inquiry Summit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.positivechange.org/downloads/AI_and_Spiritual_ResonanceV.Final.pdf{{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These approaches involve bringing large, diverse groups of people together to study and build upon the ''best'' in an organization or community.

== Uses ==

AI is used in organizational development and as a [[Management consulting|consultancy]] tool in an attempt to bring about strategic change. It has been applied in businesses, health care bodies, social non-profit organizations, educational institutions, and government operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appreciativeinquiry.case.edu/join/easySubmit.cfm|title=Easy Submit: Do you have a story, document, tool, event to share?|work= AI Commons|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although originating in the US, it is also used in the UK – for example in the  [[National Support Teams]] and around the world.  Since 2000, ''The AI Practitioner'', a quarterly publication, has described applications in a variety of settings around the world.

AI has various business applications and can effectively be used to elicit information from stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fe15/76385b5e4767493f3d51224c721494b6ec10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Positivity is paired with a group consensus to envision and begin producing an optimistic future based on existing strengths and successes. As seen in [[Harbarian process modeling]], AI has been used in [[Business process modeling]] to elicit information about an organization's present state and desired future state.

In Vancouver, AI is being used by the [[Dalai Lama Center for Peace and Education]]. The Center, which was founded by the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] and [[Victor Chan]], is using AI to facilitate compassionate communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heart-Mind Inquiry|work=Dalai Lama Center|url=http://dalailamacenter.org/programs/programs-development/appreciative-inquiry|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4678">'''Artificial empathy''' ('''AE''') is the development of AI systems − such as companion robots − that are able to detect and respond to human [[emotion]]s. According to scientists, although the technology can be perceived as scary or threatening by many people,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Jan-Philipp Stein|author2=Peter Ohler|date=2017|title=Venturing into the uncanny valley of mind—The influence of mind attribution on the acceptance of human-like characters in a virtual reality setting|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027716303055|journal=Cognition|language=en|volume=160|pages=43–50|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2016.12.010|issn=0010-0277|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it could also have a significant advantage over humans in professions which are traditionally involved in emotional role-playing such as the health care sector.&lt;ref name="Baumgaertner"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Do Emotions Matter in the Ethics of Human-Robot Interaction? |work=Artificial Empathy and Companion Robots |author=Bert Baumgaertner |author2=Astrid Weiss |publisher=European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement No. 288146 (“HOBBIT”); and the Austrian Science Foundation (FWF) under grant agreement T623-N23 (“V4HRC”) |url=http://doc.gold.ac.uk/aisb50/AISB50-S19/AISB50-S19-Baumgaertner-paper.pdf |format=PDF |via=direct download |date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the care-giver perspective for instance, performing emotional labor above and beyond the requirements of paid labor often results in chronic stress or burnout, and the development of a feeling of being desensitized to patients. However, it is argued that the emotional role-playing between the care-receiver and a robot can actually have a more positive outcome in terms of creating the conditions of less fear and concern for one's own predicament best exemplified by the phrase: "if it is just a robot taking care of me it cannot be that critical." Scholars debate the possible outcome of such technology using two different perspectives. Either, the AE could help the socialization of care-givers, or serve as role model for emotional detachment.&lt;ref name="Baumgaertner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Asada"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Affective Developmental Robotics |work=How can we design the development of artifcial empathy? |author=Minoru Asada |publisher=Dept. of Adaptive Machine Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University |location=Osaka, Japan |url=http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~kl360/HRI2014W/submission/S7.pdf |format=PDF |via=direct download |date=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of research ==
{{Main|Philosophy of artificial intelligence|Ethics of artificial intelligence}}
There are a variety of philosophical, theoretical, and applicative questions related to AE. For example:
# Which conditions would have to be met for a robot to respond competently to a human emotion?
# What models of empathy can or should be applied to Social and Assistive Robotics?
# Does the interaction of humans with robots have to imitate affective interaction between humans?
# Can a robot help science learn about affective development of humans?
# Would robots create unforeseen categories of inauthentic relations?
# What relations with robots can be considered truly authentic? &lt;ref name="Damiano"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Artificial Empathy: An Interdisciplinary Investigation |publisher=IJSR |work=Special issue |author=Luisa Damiano |author2=Paul Dumouchel |author3=Hagen Lehmann |url=http://www00.unibg.it/dati/persone/1931/7067-IJSR_Special_Issue_Damiano_et_al.pdf |format=PDF |via=direct download |date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4084">'''Communication ethics''' is the notion that  an individual's or group's behavior are governed by their morals which in turn affects [[communication]].  Generally speaking communication ethics deals with the [[moral good]] present in any form of human communication.  This includes interpersonal communication, [[mass media]]ted communication, and [[digital communication]].

==Overview==
Communication ethics concerns not only the individual, but is of great concern to businesses, corporations, and professional entities.  A business with unethical communication practices is not as effective as one with ethical communication practices. For example, a business with unethical communication practices &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Police Who Suppress Free Speech|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2014/06/filming-the-watchmen-why-the-first-amendment-protects-your-right-to-film-the-police-in-public-places}}&lt;/ref&gt; may withhold evidence that it is harming the environment or breaking a law through a lack of transparence; while a business with ethical communication practices will immediately press a release to the affected parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surgeon General on Tobacco|url=http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/initiatives/tobacco/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fearless, Adversarial Journalism|url=http://www.firstlook.org/theintercept/about/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, transparency makes the business more effective because it notifies its clients, prospective or established, providers/suppliers, or other affiliates of the potential [[environmental hazard]] or law violation. In other words, in this example, transparency will encourage trust and good faith, that the effective business will not conceal what is in the interest of its audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Locking In Public Access to Scientific Knowledge by Unlocking Scholarly Research|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/03/locking-public-access-scientific-knowledge-unlocking-scholarly-research}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the sake of counterexample, there may be a time when censorship is the more effective business practice: take the case of trade secrets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amendment to Economic Espionage Act|url=https://www.chillingeffects.org/blog_entries/742}}&lt;/ref&gt; when a design method or management tactic is not openly revealed in the name of competitive advantage;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Software Foundation Privacy Policy|url=http://www.fsf.org/about/free-software-foundation-privacy-policy}}&lt;/ref&gt; or when terms of agreement/use that a business may have with a service provider forbids transparency. In the latter counterexample, a business may use social media to advertise, but the social media service provider may limit the conduct of its users. Here, if the business considers social media to be a valuable service to achieve its advertising, it may have to censor its product or service to preserve its agreement with the social media provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facebook Terms of Agreement|url=http://www.facebook.com/terms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication ethics is also a division &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NCA|title=Communication Ethics Division|url=http://commethics.org/news/}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the NCA (National Communication Association) which was established by Western Michigan University in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCA Communication Ethics Commission - Newsletter|url=http://wmich.edu/ethics/docs/85_newsletter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well the NCA has adopted a Credo for Ethical Communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCA Credo|url=http://www.dinfosalum.org/credo2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Communication Ethics Conference has been held every year for the last 13 years, and has various speakers from Communication Studies backgrounds.

'''Communication quotient''', '''communication intelligence''', or '''CQ''' is a [[Business philosophy|theory]] that [[communication]] is a [[behaviour]] based skill that can be measured and trained.  CQ measures the ability of people to communicate effectively with one another.  The first scholarly article referring to CQ was by Robert Service in CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals.  The article was published in 2005 in the Journal of [[Information Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Service|first=Robert|title=CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals|url=http://www.uk.sagepub.com/journalsProdDesc.nav?prodId=Journal201676&amp;crossRegion=antiPod|work=CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals|publisher=Journal of Information Science|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 at [[TED conference|TED]] Women, Clare Munn spoke about the importance of our Communication Quotient in an increasingly digital world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Munn|first=Clare|title=Clare Munn at TEDWomen|url=http://www.tedwomen.aol.com/2010/10/03/clare-munn/|work=Clare Munn at TEDWomen|publisher=TEDWomen|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The development of CQ as a theory and a concept can be traced back to the challenging of [[IQ]] as fully explaining cognitive ability in 1983, by [[Howard Gardner]] with his [[Theory of multiple intelligences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gardner|first=Howard|title=Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences|url=https://www.amazon.com/Frames-Mind-Theory-Multiple-Intelligences/dp/0465025102|work=Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences|publisher=New York|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Gardner's view, traditional types of [[intelligence]], such as IQ, fail to fully explain [[cognitive ability]].  The development of CQ is part of the trend to analyse and fully understand [[Intelligence#Human intelligence|human intelligence]], a trend led by [[Daniel Goleman]]’s [[emotional intelligence]] and social intelligence.

==Definition==
''[[The Times of India]]'' in 2005 , in an article entitled A Shift from IQ, referred to CQ as an ability multi-national corporations were testing for amongst Indian graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Shift from IQ|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/A-Shift-from-IQ/articleshow/1010684.cms|work=A Shift from IQ|publisher=The Times of India|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Craig Harrison in Improving Your Communication Quotient described CQ skills specifically in terms of workplace communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Craig|title=Improving Your Communication Quotient|url=http://www.expressionsofexcellence.com/ARTICLES/CQ.htm.|work=Improving Your Communication Quotient|publisher=Expressions of Excellence|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Clare Munn and [[Maria Bello]] defined CQ as "Expressive &amp; Receptive Intelligence" the communication bridge between IQ and EQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Munn|first=Clare|title=Social Media's Value Proposition Might Just be CQ|url=http://claremunn.com/2009/04/cq-social-medias-value-proposition/|work=CQ: Expressive and Receptive Intelligence|publisher=Clare Munn|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011 Alistair Gordon and Steve Kimmens in ''The CQ Manifesto'' defined CQ as  "saying the right thing in the right way to the right people at the right time in a such a way that the message is received and understood as it was intended".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CQ Institute - What is CQ?|url=http://www.cqinstitute.com/CQ/what_is_cq.htm|work=The CQ Manifesto - Communication Intelligence: the 5 professional personas that will transform your work life and super-charge your organisation|publisher=CQ Institute|accessdate=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Robert Service’s 2005 article he presented the communication quotient as a measurable and improvable type of intelligence, specifically for IT and IS professionals.  Service argues that the improvement of communication ability will allow individuals the opportunity to move up in the organisational ranks.  The article presents two models to explain communication, the first is the model of two-way communications and the second is the CQ measurement and improvement matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Service|first=Robert|title=CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals|url=http://www.uk.sagepub.com/journalsProdDesc.nav?prodId=Journal201676&amp;crossRegion=antiPod|work=CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals|publisher=Journal of Information Science|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conflict resolution''' is conceptualized as the methods and processes involved in facilitating the peaceful ending of [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] and [[Retribution (disambiguation)|retribution]]. Committed  group members attempt to resolve group conflicts by actively communicating information about their conflicting motives or ideologies to the rest of the group (e.g., intentions; reasons for holding certain beliefs) and by engaging in collective [[negotiation]].&lt;ref name=F&gt;{{cite book |last1=Forsyth |first1=Donelson R. |date=19 March 2009 |title=Group Dynamics |edition=5th |url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Wadsworth [[Cengage Learning]] |page= |isbn=978-0495599524 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dimensions of resolution typically parallel the dimensions of conflict in the way the conflict is processed. Cognitive resolution is the way disputants understand and view the conflict, with beliefs, perspectives, understandings and attitudes. Emotional resolution is in the way disputants feel about a conflict, the emotional energy. Behavioral resolution is reflective of how the disputants act, their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mayer |first1=Bernard |date=27 March 2012 |title=The Dynamics of Conflict: A Guide to Engagement and Intervention |edition=2nd |url= |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=978-0470613535 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately a wide range of methods and procedures for addressing conflict exist, including [[negotiation]], [[mediation]], mediation-arbitration,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-the-different-types-of-conflict-resolution.htm|title=Conflict Resolution|last=Methods|first=Conflict Resolution|date=14 March 2016|work=14 March 2016|access-date=14 March 2016|via=wisegeek}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[diplomacy]], and creative [[peacebuilding]].

The term ''conflict resolution'' may also be used interchangeably with ''[[dispute resolution]]'', where arbitration and litigation processes are critically involved. The concept of conflict resolution can be thought to encompass the use of nonviolent resistance measures by conflicted parties in an attempt to promote effective resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Roberts |editor1-first=Adam |editor2-last=Ash |editor2-first=Timothy Garton |date=3 September 2009 |title=Civil Resistance and Power Politics:The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present |edition= |url= |location=Oxford, UK |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780199552016 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories and models==

===Dual concern model===

The dual concern model of conflict resolution is a conceptual perspective that assumes individuals’ preferred method of dealing with conflict is based on two underlying themes or dimensions: concern for self ([[assertiveness]]) and concern for others ([[empathy]]).&lt;ref name=F/&gt;

According to the model, group members balance their concern for satisfying personal needs and interests with their concern for satisfying the needs and interests of others in different ways. The intersection of these two dimensions ultimately leads individuals towards exhibiting different styles of conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldfien |first1=Jeffrey H. |last2=Robbennolt |first2=Jennifer K. |date=2007 |title=What if the lawyers have their way? An empirical assessment of conflict strategies and attitudes toward mediation styles. |url= |journal=Ohio State Journal on Dispute Resolution |publisher= [[Ohio State University]] [[Moritz College of Law]] |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=277–320 |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dual model identifies five [[group conflict|conflict]] resolution styles/strategies that individuals may use depending on their dispositions toward pro-self or [[prosocial behavior|pro-social]] goals.
 
; Avoidance conflict style
: Characterized by joking, changing or avoiding the topic, or even denying that a problem exists, the [[conflict avoidance]] style is used when an individual has withdrawn in dealing with the other party, when one is uncomfortable with conflict, or due to cultural contexts.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;For example, in Chinese culture, reasons for avoidance include sustaining a good mood, protecting the avoider, and other philosophical and spiritual reasonings (Feng and Wilson 2011).{{full citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During conflict, these avoiders adopt a “wait and see” attitude, often allowing conflict to phase out on its own without any personal involvement.&lt;ref name=J&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bayazit |first1=Mahmut |last2=Mannix |first2=Elizabeth A |date=2003 |title=Should I stay or should I go? Predicting team members intent to remain in the team. |url=http://sgr.sagepub.com/content/34/3/290.full.pdf |journal=Small Group Research |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=290–321 |doi=10.1177/1046496403034003002 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By neglecting to address high-conflict situations, avoiders risk allowing problems to fester or spin out of control.
; Yielding conflict style
: In contrast, yielding, “accommodating”, smoothing or [[thought suppression|suppression]] conflict styles are characterized by a high level of concern for others and a low level of concern for oneself. This passive pro-social approach emerges when individuals derive personal satisfaction from meeting the needs of others and have a general concern for maintaining stable, positive social relationships.&lt;ref name=F/&gt; When faced with conflict, individuals with a yielding conflict style tend to harmonize into others’ demands out of respect for the social relationship.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
; Competitive conflict style
: The [[Competition|competitive]], “fighting” or forcing conflict style maximizes individual assertiveness (i.e., concern for self) and minimizes empathy (i.e., concern for others). Groups consisting of competitive members generally enjoy seeking domination over others, and typically see conflict as a “win or lose” predicament.&lt;ref name=F/&gt; Fighters tend to force others to accept their personal views by employing competitive power tactics (arguments, insults, accusations or even violence) that foster intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morrill |first1=Calvin|year=1995 |title=The Executive Way: Conflict Management in Corporations |edition= |url= |location=Chicago, US |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |isbn=0-226-53873-7 |lccn=94033344}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Conciliation conflict style
: The [[conciliation]], “compromising”, bargaining or negotiation conflict style is typical of individuals who possess an intermediate level of concern for both personal and others’ outcomes. Compromisers value fairness and, in doing so, anticipate mutual give-and-take interactions.&lt;ref name=J/&gt; By accepting some demands put forth by others, compromisers believe this agreeableness will encourage others to meet them halfway, thus promoting conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van de Vliert |first1=Evert |last2=Euwema |first2=Martin C. |date=1994 |title=Agreeableness and activeness as components of conflict behaviors. |url= |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=674–687 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.4.674 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conflict style can be considered an extension of both “yielding” and “cooperative” strategies.&lt;ref name=F/&gt;
;Cooperation conflict style
:Characterized by an active concern for both pro-social and pro-self behavior, the [[cooperation]], integration, confrontation or problem-solving conflict style is typically used when an individual has elevated interests in their own outcomes as well as in the outcomes of others. During conflict, cooperators collaborate with others in an effort to find an amicable solution that satisfies all parties involved in the conflict. Individuals using this type of conflict style tend to be both highly assertive and highly empathetic.&lt;ref name=J/&gt; By seeing conflict as a creative opportunity, collaborators willingly invest time and resources into finding a “win-win” solution.&lt;ref name=F/&gt; According to the literature on conflict resolution, a cooperative conflict resolution style is recommended above all others. This resolution may be achieved by lowering the aggressor's guard while raising the ego.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fitness365academy.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sternberg |first1=Robert J. |last2=Dobson |first2=Diane M. |date=1987 |title=Resolving interpersonal conflicts: An analysis of stylistic consistency. |url= |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=794–812 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.4.794 |issn=0022-3514 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jarboe |first1=Susan C. |last2=Witteman |first2=Hal R. |date=1996 |title=Intragroup conflict management in task-oriented groups: The influence of problem sources and problem analyses. |url= |journal=Small Group Research |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=316–338 |doi=10.1177/1046496496272007 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict resolution curve==

There are many examples of conflict resolution in history, and there has been a debate about the ways to conflict resolution: whether it should be forced or peaceful. Conflict resolution by peaceful means is always a better option. The conflict resolution curve derived from an analytical model offers a peaceful solution by motivating conflicting entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Das |first1=Tuhin K. |title=Regret Analysis Towards Conflict Resolution |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |date=2018 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.3173490 |ssrn=3173490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forced resolution of conflict might invoke another conflict in future.

Conflict resolution curve (CRC) separates conflict styles into two separate domains: domain of competing entities and domain of accommodating entities([https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Conflict-resolution-curve_fig1_325262817 Image of CRC ]). There is a sort of agreement between targets and aggressors on this curve. Their judgements of badness compared to goodness of each other are analogous on CRC. So, arrival of all conflicting entities to some negotiable points on CRC is important before peace building. CRC does not exist (i.e., singular) in reality if the chance of aggression of the aggressor is certain. Under such circumstances it might lead to apocalypse with mutual destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Das |first1=Tuhin K. |title=Conflict Resolution Curve: Concept and Reality |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |date=2018 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.3196791 |ssrn=3196791}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The curve explains why nonviolent struggles ultimately toppled repressive regimes from power and sometimes forced leaders to change the nature of governance. Also, this methodology has been applied to capture the conflict styles in Korean Peninsula and dynamics of negotiation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Das |first1=Tuhin K. |last2=Datta Ray |first2=Ishita |title=North Korea's Peace Building in the Light of Conflict Resolution Curve |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |date=2018 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.3193759 |ssrn=3193759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political conflict resolution in practice==
[[File:Dayan and el Tell.jpg|thumb|[[Moshe Dayan]] and [[Abdullah el Tell]] reach a ceasefire agreement during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] in Jerusalem on 30 November 1948]]
[[Wars]] may occur between parties who contest an incompatibility. The nature of an incompatibility can be [[territory (country subdivision)|territorial]] or [[governmental]], but a warring party must be a "government of a state or any opposition organization or alliance of organizations that uses [[armed force]] to promote its position in the incompatibility in an intrastate or an interstate armed conflict".&lt;ref&gt;[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]]. "[http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/#Warring_party_2 Definitions: Warring party]". Accessed April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Wars can conclude with a [[peace agreement]], which is a "formal agreement... which addresses the disputed incompatibility, either by settling all or part of it, or by clearly outlining a process for how... to regulate the incompatibility."&lt;ref&gt;[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]]. "[http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/#Peace_agreement Definitions: Peace agreement]". Accessed April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[ceasefire]] is another form of agreement made by warring parties; unlike a peace agreement, it only "regulates the conflict behaviour of warring parties", and does not resolve the issue that brought the parties to war in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]]. "[http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/#Ceasefire_agreements Ceasefire agreements]". Accessed April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peacekeeping]] measures may be deployed to avoid violence in solving such incompatibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellamy|first1=Alex J.|last2=Williams|first2=Paul|title=Understanding Peacekeeping|date=29 March 2010|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-4186-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the last century, political theorists have been developing the theory of a [[global peace system]] that relies upon broad social and political measures to avoid war in the interest of achieving [[world peace]].&lt;ref name="RamSummy2007"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McElwee|first=Timothy A. |editor1-first=Senthil |editor1-last=Ram |editor2-first=Ralph |editor2-last=Summy|encyclopedia=Nonviolence: An Alternative for Defeating Global Terror(ism) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yopi-nCzQF8C&amp;pg=PA187&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2007 |publisher=[[Nova Science Publishers]] |isbn=978-1-60021-812-5 |title=The Role of UN Police in Nonviolently Countering Terrorism |pages=187–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blue Peace approach developed by [[Strategic Foresight Group]] facilitates cooperation between countries over shared water resources, thus reducing the risk of war and enabling sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/28458Lessons%20Learnt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflict resolution is an expanding field of professional practice, both in the U.S. and around the world. The escalating costs of conflict have increased use of third parties who may serve as a conflict specialists to resolve conflicts. In fact, relief and development organizations have added peace-building specialists to their teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2016|title=Conflict management capabilities of peace-brokering international organizations, 1945–2010: A new dataset|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0738894215572757|journal=Conflict Management and Peace Science|publisher=SAGE|volume=33|issue=2|pages=198–223|via=|last1=Lundgren|first1=Magnus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many major international [[non-governmental organizations]] have seen a growing need to hire practitioners trained in conflict analysis and resolution. Furthermore, this expansion has resulted in the need for conflict resolution practitioners to work in a variety of settings such as  in businesses, court systems, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and educational institutions throughout the world.

==Culture-based==
Conflict resolution as both a professional practice and academic field is highly sensitive to [[culture|cultural]] practices. In Western cultural contexts, such as [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], successful conflict resolution usually involves fostering communication among disputants, problem solving, and drafting agreements that meet underlying needs. In these situations, conflict resolvers often talk about finding a mutually satisfying ("[[Win-win game|win-win]]") solution for everyone involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ury |first1=William |last2=Fisher |first2=Roger |date=1981 |title=Getting To Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In |edition=1st |url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co. |page= |isbn=0-395-31757-6 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many non-Western cultural contexts, such as [[Afghanistan]], [[Vietnam]], and [[China]], it is also important to find "win-win" solutions; however, the routes taken to find them may be very different. In these contexts, direct communication between disputants that explicitly addresses the issues at stake in the conflict can be perceived as very rude, making the conflict worse and delaying resolution. It can make sense to involve religious, tribal, or community leaders; communicate difficult truths through a third party; or make suggestions through stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Augsburger |first1=David W. |date=1992 |title=Conflict Mediation Across Cultures:Pathways and Patterns |edition=1st |url= |location=Louisville, KY |publisher=[[Westminster John Knox Press]] |page= |isbn=978-0664219611 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intercultural conflicts are often the most difficult to resolve because the expectations of the disputants can be very different, and there is much occasion for misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Intercultural Conflict in Groups|journal=Journal for Specialists in Group Work|date=December 2016|volume=41|issue=4|pages=350–369|doi=10.1080/01933922.2016.1232769|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In animals==
Conflict resolution has also been studied in non-humans, including dogs, cats, monkeys, snakes, elephants, and [[primates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Waal |first1=Frans B. M. |authorlink=Frans de Waal |date=28 July 2000 |title=Primates—A natural heritage of conflict resolution. |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/289/5479/586.full |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] |volume=289 |issue=5479 |pages=586–590 |doi=10.1126/science.289.5479.586 |issn=0036-8075 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aggression]] is more common among relatives and within a group than between groups. Instead of creating distance between the individuals, primates tend to be more intimate in the period after an aggressive incident. These intimacies consist of [[Personal grooming|grooming]] and various forms of body contact. [[Stress (medicine)|Stress responses]], including increased heart rates, usually decrease after these reconciliatory signals. Different types of primates, as well as many other species who live in groups, display different types of conciliatory behavior. Resolving conflicts that threaten the interaction between individuals in a group is necessary for survival, giving it a strong [[evolution]]ary value.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} These findings contradict previous existing theories about the general function of aggression, i.e. creating space between individuals (first proposed by [[Konrad Lorenz]]), which seems to be more the case in conflicts between groups than it is within groups.

In addition to research in [[primates]], biologists are beginning to explore [[:wikt:reconciliation|reconciliation]] in other animals. Until recently, the literature dealing with reconciliation in non-primates has consisted of anecdotal observations and very little quantitative data. Although peaceful post-conflict behavior had been documented going back to the 1960s, it was not until 1993 that Rowell made the first explicit mention of reconciliation in [[feral]] [[sheep]]. Reconciliation has since been documented in spotted hyenas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wahaj |first1=Sofia A. |last2=Guse |first2=Kevin R. |last3=Holekamp |first3=Kay E. |date=December 2001 |title=Reconciliation in the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta). |url=http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1046/j.1439-0310.2001.00717.x |journal=Ethology |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |volume=107 |issue=12 |pages=1057–1074 |doi=10.1046/j.1439-0310.2001.00717.x |ISSN=0179-1613 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Jennifer E. |last2=Powning |first2=Katherine S. |last3=Dawes |first3=Stephanie E. |last4=Estrada |first4=Jillian R. |last5=Hopper |first5=Adrienne L. |last6=Piotrowski |first6=Stacey L. |last7=Holekamp |first7=Kay E. |date=February 2011 |title=Greetings promote cooperation and reinforce social bonds among spotted hyaenas. |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347210004501 |journal=Animal Behaviour |publisher= |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=401–415 |doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.11.007 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; lions, [[bottlenose dolphin]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weaver |first1=Ann |date=October 2003 |title=Conflict and reconciliation in captive bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus. |url= |journal=Marine Mammal Science |publisher=[[Society for Marine Mammalogy]] |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=836–846 |doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.2003.tb01134.x |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; dwarf mongoose, domestic goats,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schino |first1=Gabriele |date=1998 |title=Reconciliation in domestic goats. |url= |journal=Behaviour |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |volume=135 |issue=3 |pages=343–356 |doi=10.1163/156853998793066302 |jstor=4535531 |issn=0005-7959 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; domestic dogs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cools |first1=Annemieke K.A. |last2=Van Hout |first2=Alain J.-M. |last3=Nelissen |first3=Mark H.

==Education==

Universities worldwide offer programs of study pertaining to conflict research, analysis, and practice. [[Conrad Grebel University College]] at the [[University of Waterloo]] has the oldest-running [[peace and conflict studies]] (PACS) program in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;University at Waterloo. "[https://uwaterloo.ca/peace-conflict-studies/ Peace and Conflict Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; PACS can be taken as an Honors, 4-year general, or 3-year general major, joint major, minor, and diploma. Grebel also offers an interdisciplinary Master of Peace and Conflict Studies professional program. The [[Cornell University]] [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations|ILR School]] houses the Scheinman Institute on Conflict Resolution, which offers undergraduate, graduate, and professional training on conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Cornell ILR Scheinman Institute |url=http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/conflictRes/about/index.html |date= |work= |publisher=[[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]] |accessdate=23 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also offers dispute resolution concentrations for its {{abbr|MILR|Master of Industrial and Labor Relations}}, JD/MILR, [[Master of Professional Studies|MPS]], and [[Master of Science|MS]]/PhD graduate degree programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scheinman Institute on Conflict Resolution – Degrees |url=http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/conflictRes/academic/degrees/index.html |year=2014 |work= |publisher=[[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]] |accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the graduate level, [[Eastern Mennonite University]]'s [[Center for Justice and Peacebuilding]] offers a [[Master of Arts]] in Conflict Transformation, a dual [[Master of Divinity]]/MA in Conflict Transformation degree, and several graduate certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Graduate Program in Conflict Transformation |url=http://www.emu.edu/cjp/grad/ |date= |work= |publisher=[[Eastern Mennonite University]]'s [[Center for Justice and Peacebuilding]] |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; EMU also offers an accelerated 5-year BA in Peacebuilding and Development/MA in Conflict Transformation.

Conflict resolution is a growing area of interest in UK pedagogy, with teachers and students both encouraged to learn about mechanisms that lead to aggressive action and those that lead to peaceful resolution. The [[University of Law]], one of the oldest common law training institutions in the world, offers a legal-focused masters degree in Conflict Resolution as an LL.M. (Conflict resolution).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.ac.uk/postgraduate/llm/|title=LLM Masters in Law Degree {{!}} The University of Law|website=www.law.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tel Aviv University]] offers two graduate degree programs in the field of conflict resolution, including the English-language [[International Program in Conflict Resolution and Mediation]], allowing students to learn in a geographic region which is the subject of much research on international conflict resolution.

The Nelson Mandela Center for Peace &amp; Conflict Resolution at Jamia Millia Islamia University, New Delhi, is one of the first centers for peace and conflict resolution to be established at an Indian university. It offers a two-year full-time MA course in Conflict Analysis and Peace-Building, as well as a PhD in Conflict and Peace Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jmi.ac.in/aboutjamia/centres/conflict-resolution/introduction|title=Jamia - Centres - Nelson Mandela Centre for Peace and Conflict Resolution - Introduction|publisher=Jmi.ac.in|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict management==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2007}}
'''Conflict management''' refers to the long-term management of intractable conflicts. It is the label for the variety of ways by which people handle grievances—standing up for what they consider to be right and against what they consider to be wrong. Those ways include such diverse phenomena as gossip, ridicule, lynching, terrorism, warfare, feuding, genocide, law, mediation, and avoidance.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} Which forms of conflict management will be used in any given situation can be somewhat predicted and explained by the social structure—or social geometry—of the case.

Conflict management is often considered to be distinct from conflict resolution. 
In order for actual conflict to occur, there should be an expression of exclusive patterns which explain why and how the conflict was expressed the way it was. Conflict is often connected to a previous issue. Resolution refers to resolving a dispute to the approval of one or both parties, whereas management is concerned with an ongoing process that may never have a resolution. Neither is considered the same as [[conflict transformation]], which seeks to reframe the positions of the conflict parties.

The role of culture is not always fully appreciated and must be taken into account. In a [http://www.britac.ac.uk/blog/ocean-model-civilization-sustainable-history-theory-and-global-cultural-understanding piece on “the ocean model of civilization”], Prof Nayef Al-Rodhan argues that greater transcultural understanding is critical for global security because it diminishes ‘hierarchies’ and alienation, and avoids dehumanization of the ‘other’.

===Counseling===
When personal conflict leads to [[frustration]] and loss of efficiency, [[counseling]] may prove helpful. Although few [[organization]]s can afford to have professional counselors on staff, given some training, managers may be able to perform this function. Nondirective counseling, or "listening with understanding", is little more than being a good listener—something every manager should be.&lt;ref name="Knowles"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Henry P. |last1=Knowles |first2=Börje O. |last2=Saxberg |title= Personality and Leadership Behavior |publisher= Addison-Wesley Publishing Co.|location=Reading, MA |year=1971 |asin=B0014O4YN0 |oclc=118832 |doi= |nopp=true |chapter=Chapter 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes simply being able to express one's feelings to a concerned and understanding listener is enough to relieve frustration and make it possible for an individual to advance to a problem-solving frame of mind. The nondirective approach is one effective way for managers to deal with frustrated subordinates and coworkers.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard Arvid |last=Johnson |title=Management, Systems, and Society: An Introduction |publisher=Goodyear Pub. Co. |date=January 1976 |location=Pacific Palisades, Calif.  |pages=148–142 |isbn=978-0-87620-540-2 |oclc=2299496 |ol=8091729M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other, more direct and more diagnostic, methods that could be used in appropriate circumstances. However, the great strength of the nondirective approach&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Nondirective counseling is based on the [[client-centered therapy]] of [[Carl Rogers]].&lt;/ref&gt; lies in its simplicity, its effectiveness, and that it deliberately avoids the manager-counselor's diagnosing and interpreting emotional problems, which would call for special psychological training. Listening to staff with sympathy and understanding is unlikely to escalate the problem, and is a widely-used approach for helping people cope with problems that interfere with their effectiveness in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

====Steps to conflict resolution in the classroom====

Step 1: Clarifying and focusing: problem ownership

Negative feelings such as annoyance, anger and discomfort can interfere with understanding exactly what is wrong in situations of confrontation and how to set things right again. Gaining a bit of distance from negative feelings is exactly what such moments call for, especially on the part of the person with (presumably) the greatest maturity. ''Problem ownership'' is defined as deciding who should take ownership of the behavior or conflict in the issue (Gordon, 2003). The main person who is bothered by the root problem is also the “owner” of the problem, and thus the owner of a problem needs to be the one who takes primary responsibility for solving the issue. Identifying ownership makes a difference in how behavior is dealt with, as well as how the problem is effectively solved. It is important to ask clarifying questions to really understand the root causes of the conflict.

Step 2: Active listening

Several strategies help with distinguishing who has a problem with a behavior and who takes ownership. One of those strategies is active listening. Active listening is attending carefully to all aspects of what a student says and attempting to understand or empathize as much as one can (Seifert &amp; Sutton). Active listening consists of continually asking questions in order to test your understanding. It also requires giving encouragement to the student by letting them tell their story, and paraphrasing what the student says so you can form an unbiased conclusion. It is key not to move too quickly at solving the problem by just giving advice, instructions, or scolding. Responding too soon with solutions can shut down the student’s communication and leave you with inaccurate impressions of the source or nature of the problem (Seifert &amp; Sutton).

Step 3: Assertive discipline and I-messages

Once you, as the teacher, have taken in the student’s point of view, form your comments around how the student’s behavior affects your role. Your comments should be assertive, emphasize I-messages, and encourage the student to think about the effects of his or her behavior. They should not be passive, apologetic, hostile or aggressive, but matter-of-fact, such as, “Charlie, you are talking while I am talking.” The comments should emphasize I-messages that focus on how the behavior is affecting the teacher’s teaching and the other students' learning (Seifert &amp; Sutton). An example of this would be, “You are making it hard for me to focus on teaching this math lesson.” Lastly, you should ask the student more open-ended questions that make him or her think about the consequences of his or her behavior, such as, “How do the other kids feel when you yell in the middle of class?” (Seifert &amp; Sutton). 
* The comments should encourage the student to think about the effects of his or her actions on others—-a strategy that in effect encourages the student to consider the ethical implications of the actions (Gibbs, 2003). Instead of simply saying, “When you cut in line ahead of the other kids, that was not fair to them”, you can try asking, “How do you think the other kids feel when you cut in line ahead of them?”

Step 4: Negotiation

Seifert and Sutton state that the first three steps describe desirable ways of handling situations that are specific and last for only a short time. These steps by themselves could potentially not be enough when conflicts persist over extended periods of time. Often it is better to negotiate a solution in these situations. Negotiating is defined as methodically deliberating various options and deciding on one if possible (Seifert &amp; Sutton). Even though negotiation demands time and energy, it often demands less time or effort ultimately than continuing to cope with the problem. The results of negotiation can be valuable to everyone involved in the situation. Various experts on conflict resolution have suggested different ways to negotiate with students about problems that are continual (Seifert &amp; Sutton). The theories differ in specifics, but typically are generally similar to the steps we previously discussed:
* Determine what the problem is—involves active listening 
* Discuss and share possible solutions, consider their efficacy
* Attempt to reach a consensus: Total agreement on the subject will not always be possible, but should be set as your end goal
* Assess the success of the decision: Renegotiation might be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Classroom Management and the Learning Environment|last=Seifert|first=K|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cyprus Civil Society Awards''' were established in 2008 as part of a [[United Nations]]-funded project aiming to strengthen the role of civil society in Cyprus. One organization from the [[Greek Cypriot]] and one organization from the [[Turkish Cypriot]] community was each presented an award for their contribution to social development in six unique categories:

# education and culture
# environment
# gender issues
# health
# youth
# social inclusion

The awards have been established in order to promote reconciliation and facilitate interactions between the non-governmental organization between the two conflicting communities on the island. The awards are managed and presented by a consortium consisting of [http://www.mc-med.eu/ The Management Centre] from the Turkish Cypriot community, the [http://www.ngo-sc.org/ NGO Support Centre]&lt; from the Greek Cypriot community and INTRAC from the UK.

'''Digital phobic''' is an informal phrase used to describe a reluctance to become fully immersed in the [[digital age]] for being fearful of how it might negatively change or alter everyday life.
 
The fast-paced development of the [[digital world]] in the twenty-first century has contributed to the [[digital divide]] becoming a very real problem for a segment of the population for whom a lack of education of, interest in, or access to [[digital device]]s has left them excluded from the technological world and fearful of its growing omnipresence.

Digital phobic is part of a growing dictionary of digital vocabulary exploring the [[social influence|social impact]] of the [[technological age]].  The phrase considers the fears associated with [[technological evolution]] and change, and acknowledges the possibility of exclusion as a result of a rising reliance on technology in day-to-day life.

==Discourse==
Everyday use of technology has increased dramatically since the turn of the century, significantly impacting both those embracing [[technological change]] as well as those reluctant to be a part of it.

A sharp rise in technological innovations during the 21st century has been responsible for changing much of the way we work, socialize, and learn – all of which can be at the foundation of distrust in the technological age.  Psychologists, academics and researchers have begun to consider the base of these fears and consider the social, cultural and environmental circumstances which might catalyze someone to becoming 'digital phobic'.

[[Technophobia]] is used to discuss a fear of advanced technology in a formal capacity and can stem from a number, and combination of, concerns.  With the oncoming of the [[digital age]], worries have broadened from the very earliest fears that technology would eradicate artisanship to concerns over [[data protection]], [[Economic security|financial security]], [[identity theft]], [[technical inability]] and [[invasion of privacy]].

There is no exhaustible list of reasons cited for fearing the digital world and, whilst research into both the cause and consequence of developing a digital phobia remains in its infancy, the presence of digital phobia regardless contributes towards an increasingly comprehensive picture of a series of profiles among digital users.
 
Recent research from Foresters, an international financial services organization, found 2% of the UK population to fall into this category of [[internet user]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/digital-addict--or-just-checking-your-facebook-page-a-quarter-of-all-men-and-women-spend-an-unhealthy-amount-of-time-online-9506966.html Paul Gallagher.  Digital Addict – or just checking your Facebook page?  A quarter of all men and women spend an 'unhealthy amount of time online'.  The Independent.  8 June 2014.  Accessed: 27 August 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;   A further breakdown of this statistic, sees the percentage of users in development of a digital phobia increase, with 4% fearful of [[online shopping]] for worrying that someone will steal their card details, and 12% fearful that using social media will make it easier for people to find their personal details.

When asked to reason their attitude towards technology as part of this survey, a larger percentage of the UK population were revealed to be fearful of the impact it could be having on more traditional means of doing things. 31% believed technology was preventing us from communicating properly, while 32% thought advances in technology will result in long-held [[loss of tradition|traditions being lost]].

This fear has only been exacerbated over time as more and more data-holding, services and opportunities are transferred to the digital realm, and both the perceived and real nature of security and vulnerability risks increases.  Worrying levels of time spent on devices, the invasion of privacy or the possible misuse or [[data abuse|abuse]] of [[personal data]] entrusted to online sources are all contributing towards the development of a digital phobia among a proportion of the population.

Concerns about the negative, exclusionary or divisive consequences of living within a digital society are being voiced from various global platforms. April 2014 research conducted by [[Pew Research Center]], in association with [[Smithsonian Magazine]], revealed concerns about anticipated technological developments over the next half-century.  30% of Americans surveyed feared that technological changes would lead to a future in which people are worse off than they are at the time of being surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Aaron|last=Smith|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/04/17/us-views-of-technology-and-the-future/|title=Future of Technology - Pew Research Center|date=17 April 2014|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considered amid reports of dis-interest in the internet among Japan's residents despite its reputation as a high-tech nation, these reports contribute towards a growing understanding that high-tech advancements are not universally celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10543126.  Michael Fitzpatrick.  Revealing Japan's Low Tech Belly.  BBC News.  13 July 2010.  Accessed: 20 August 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the May 2014 "[[right to be forgotten]]" ruling put in place in the European Union which allows internet users to request for their internet history to be un-searchable if deemed incorrect, outdated or irrelevant, and the thousands of requests received in the first few days following its announcement documents a, perhaps previously hidden, widespread fear of leaving a digital footprint and/or being falsely represented online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/26/google-removing-right-to-be-forgotten-links|author=Charles Arthur|title=Google removing 'right to be forgotten' search links in Europe|journal=The Guardian|date=27 June 2014|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Digital phobia is part of a wider societal conversation on how we relate to, trust in, and interact with technology and considers the potentially negative implications of what otherwise appears to be a positive advancement of the modern world. 
 
This phrase has been developed by Foresters, the international financial services organisation, for the purpose of describing attitudes to technology among the UK population.

Developed within a digital vocabulary consisting of four other phrases ([[digital addict]], [[digital omnivore]], digital agnostic, digital denier), digital phobic is part of a scale of social description for online behavior within the digital age.

The phrase has been used as part of discussion on the more general use of technology within the 21st century and the importance of striking a balance between time spent on and offline.  Research conducted by Foresters in association with Tech Timeout,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techtimeout.com/|title=Tech Timeout|work=Tech Timeout|accessdate=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a social communications initiative considering the role of technology in contemporary society, formed the basis of the descriptor and identified the key traits of each type of digital user based on answers from over 1,000 UK respondents. 
 
Both anecdotal and research-based evidence suggests categories of internet use, whilst they cannot be linearly divided, are able to loosely describe attitudes to technology in society.  The developed phrases are able to be used to greater understand and contextualize how new and existing technology is viewed and have been cited in international [[online newspaper]]s and [[blog post]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/technology/news/article.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=11270004.|title=Digital addict - spending an 'unhealthy' amount of time online|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=June 8, 2014|accessdate=August 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst this phrase and definition were developed specifically from research on UK technology-users, the phrase is not UK-specific and is designed to be indicative of a global community of technology users who share in these characteristics.

==Social and cultural impact==
Digital phobia presents a real and pressing problem in the modern world where technology has become a central and essential resource.  [[Internet culture]] has developed to become a part of the fabric of [[everyday life]] and is now even considered part of the make-up of [[national identity]] with a country's internet use and [[digital footprint]] an important modern index for international comparison, often associated with development and [[modernity]].

The consequences of [[non-participation]] in the digital world are far reaching, and can affect the economic, cultural, social, occupational and educational life of a non-user.  For example, in 2009 [[Price Waterhouse Coopers]] estimated that UK households offline are missing out on savings of £560 a year which could be saved if shopping or paying for bills online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalbirmingham.co.uk/downloads/pwc_report.pdf |format=PDF |work=Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP. |title=Champion for Digital Inclusion: The Economic Case for Digital Inclusion |date=October 2009 |accessdate=August 27, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329114456/http://www.digitalbirmingham.co.uk/downloads/pwc_report.pdf |archivedate=March 29, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, in the United States older people without internet access or the skills to make the most of it are considered a disadvantaged proportion of the population as, amongst other important resources, vital healthcare information and initiatives conducted online are unavailable to those not a part of the digital world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kaitlin |last=Roberts|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/262309/how-the-digital-divide-hurts-the-elderly-in-times-of-crisis|title=How the digital divide hurts the elderly in times of crisis|work=theweek.com|date=May 30, 2014|accessdate=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heightened fears of how technology may be affecting the human population stems from a, for some very logical, fear of how technology is adapting the world we live in and at the pace and price with which it is doing so.  With such a significance placed on [[online participation]], concerns about the role of the internet in everyday life are not unfounded and not exclusive to those who prefer to stay away from the internet, avoid certain activities online, or use the internet without enthusiasm and only as necessitated.

A survey conducted by security firm [[Avira]] identified 84% of people fear [[social networking site]]s will steal or misuse their personal information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matt |last=Liebowitz|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/47264062/ns/technology_and_science-security/t/people-fear-social-media/%20-%20.U5rM8yxOXL8#.U6rR8SxOXL8|title=84% of People Fear Social Media|work=msnbc.com|date= February 5, 2012|accessdate=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating the net majority of internet users share, at least partially, in distrusting the digital world. Whilst many will, despite this fear, adopt cautious optimism and still use social networking as part of their everyday lives this high percentage serves to demonstrate that a fear significant enough for some to avoid readily using online and [[digital service]]s is a fear shared by a large number of internet users.

Whilst some digital phobics have preferred to remain distanced from technology due to hypothetical concerns others have attempted to join in societal interest but find themselves unable to stay caught up with new technology or would like to see its progression halted as evolution of the [[digital world]] has reached new speeds. The 2013 [[Oxford Internet Survey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxis.oii.ox.ac.uk/sites/oxis.oii.ox.ac.uk/files/content/files/publications/OxIS_2013.pdf |format=PDF |first1=William H. |last1=Dutton |first2=Grant |last2=Blank |title=Cultures of the Internet: The Internet in Britain |work=The Oxford Internet Survey 2013 |accessdate=June 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602045751/http://oxis.oii.ox.ac.uk/sites/oxis.oii.ox.ac.uk/files/content/files/publications/OxIS_2013.pdf |archivedate=June 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; recognizes this concern among UK users, identifying distinct categories of both non-users and ex-users of internet-based technology who, for a variety of reasons, have discontinued or refuse to access the online world.  This is further supported by results from a 2013 survey of internet use in America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kathryn |last=Zickuhr|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/09/25/whos-not-online-and-why/|title=Who's Not Online and Why|date=25 September 2013|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|accessdate=August 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which found 32% of non-internet users avoiding the online world because of finding the internet difficult or frustrating to use, being physically unable or worried about other issues such as viruses, threat of hacking or spam – a figure considerably higher than in earlier years.

Concern over the presence of a [[digital divide]], whether locally or globally, is only exacerbated by the knowledge that access to many government and council services, [[job application]]s, and social and cultural resources are now largely internet based. [[Internet access]] has become a hurdle in contemporary society which, for those without the necessary desire to learn or knowledge of internet-based systems, can be difficult to navigate around, often resulting in key services and vital resources being less easily accessible, leaving non-users feeling isolated.  Private and government campaigns to tackle this issue further demonstrate the severity and long-lasting impact of having a proportion of the population disinclined or disinterested in going online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jenny |last=Hirschkon|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/finance/your-bank/10890366/elderly-help-internet.html|title=Connecting the elderly with internet know-how|date=June 12, 2014|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kathy |last=Settle|url=https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/04/14/digital-inclusion-strategy-launches-today/|title=Digital Inclusion Strategy launches today|work=blog.gov.uk|date=April 14, 2014| accessdate=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the online world becomes saturated, device options for connecting to the internet vary and news of technological inventions goes [[viral marketing|viral]] the [[exponential growth]] of the technological world is only contributing towards a growing number of 'digital phobic' tech-users amongst the [[global population]].

== Education ==
Digital phobia has had a negative impact on the field of education. Some teachers have expressed a fear that new and advanced technology is supplanting them as the masters of their fields of study and a study of teachers in Wilmington, Delaware has shown that educators in this area are acclimating to the new technology in their classrooms at a slower pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/06/11/why-ed-tech-is-not-transforming-how.html|title=Why Ed Tech Is Not Transforming How Teachers Teach|work=Education Week|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local researchers believe that there are many factors why that is the case and some of the things they have found are things such as a lack of technological education by the teachers, and also the lack of time, or incentive to adjust to the new technology. University Larry Cuban has stated that "The introduction of computers into school was supposed to improve academic achievement , and alter how teachers taught. Neither has occurred."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/06/11/why-ed-tech-is-not-transforming-how.html|title=Why Ed Tech Is Not Transforming How Teachers Teach|work=Education Week|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constant infusion of new technology has many teachers fearing that they are losing their classroom. This new technology is essentially diminishing the role of a teacher in the classroom.

Researchers believe that educators are slow to adapt to technology because they aren't given time to acclimate to the new technology, causing them to hesitate to use it in the classroom and express fear that these technologies may interfere with genuine learning particularly in humanities and creative subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/sep/13/schools.news1|title=Report reveals teachers' fear of classroom technology|last=Curtis|first=Polly|date=2005-09-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-06|last2=correspondent|first2=education|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for the ''New Media Reader,'' Theodor H. Nelson wrote that people are opposed to the computer because they believe it is "cold" and "inhuman", but a human can be just as inhuman and maybe even more so than the actual machine itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50096832|title=The NewMediaReader|date=2003|publisher=MIT Press|others=Wardrip-Fruin, Noah., Montfort, Nick.|isbn=9780262232272|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=50096832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''El Sueño de Arquímedes''' was a Spanish science podcast and radio program which was broadcast by [[Radio Nacional de España|Radio Nacional de España (RNE)]] from September 2006 until June, 2007. The program was created by [[Ángel Rodríguez Lozano]]. A total of 35 programs are still available for download. In addition to El Sueño de Arquímedes, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano also hosted [[Vanguardia de la Ciencia]], which was broadcast weekly without interruption from April 1995 until June 2007. The name of the program means "the dream of [[Archimedes]]", and alludes to Archimedes' statement that given a [[lever]] and a fixed point, he could move the world. To Ángel Rodríguez Lozano, the dream was moving the world by popularizing and sharing knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dimetu.com/2008/02/20/retropodcast-12-entrevista-a-angel-rodriguez-lozano/ ¡DIME TÚ! – Entrevista a Ángel Rodríguez Lozano.] First published 30 June 2007.''"Arquímedes, lo que propuso fue que con una palanca podía mover el mundo. Para mi, El sueño de Arquímedes era simplemente mover el mundo divulgando y repartiendo conocimiento."''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Before the startup of El Sueño de Arquímedes, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano had been hosting Vanguardia de la Ciencia for more than a decade. When RNE
asked if he would host a second popular science program, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano realised that the scheduled timing, Sundays between 3 and 4 p.m, meant that it would be sandwiched between sports broadcasts. Therefore, he would have to capture the attention of listeners who were not looking for this type of program. The intention was therefore to make the program even more accessible than Vanguardia de la Ciencia, with shorter interviews and more music. Ángel Rodríguez Lozano stated that it had been a marvellous experience, and that the response had been tremendous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dimetu.com/2008/02/20/retropodcast-12-entrevista-a-angel-rodriguez-lozano/ |title=¡DIME TÚ! – Entrevista a Ángel Rodríguez Lozano |publisher=Dimetu.com |date=20 February 2008 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program included science news, interviews, and biographies of great scientists, written by [http://www.rtve.es/?go=111b735a516af85c9c789c7a4fd3f107a35c62168843087fd36ba7aa2d2b605dceedec15a322702dd41da976ac96c4395def1e9f8e232e7869bb1c304bb715731b852947013e5ad675ccaeddfc4875cdea9bcd15f8880681 Carmen Buergo]. In the final, humorous section of the program, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano paid a visit to the archetypical [[mad scientist]]
[http://www.ciencia.rne.es/?go=111b735a516af85c9c789c7a4fd3f107a35c62168843087fd36ba7aa2d2b605d5391d7ca78deb60dc51e84fc79f34cf020766f1ed143c396b5d1b644b9b60d9d0e1aa0b6615df94332359e92d8b381cbb51cf1d8bab454cc Alejandro Laguna], who supposedly lived and worked in a hidden laboratory in the basements of Radio Nacional de España, seven floors below ground level. Alejandro would demonstrate one of his latest inventions, which usually defied the laws of physics, and Ángel played the role of a rather gullible spectator. Alejandro then explained the physics of the corresponding real-world device. Finally, the demonstration of his invention usually had some highly unpleasant consequence for Ángel.

==Termination of El Sueño de Arquímedes==

In June 2007, El Sueño de Arquímedes and Vanguardia de la Ciencia were abruptly terminated. In the correspondence section of one of the last programs of Vangurardia de la Ciencia, Ángel Rodríguez Lozano explained, in response to a letter from an outraged listener, that the decision to terminate the program was made due to a re-structuration of RNE, and that he was but one of 4,150 employees who had to leave.&lt;ref&gt;
Correspondence section at the end of the program [[Vanguardia de la Ciencia]] of 9 June 2007. {{cite web |url=http://www.vanguardia.rne.es/FRONT_PROGRAMAS?go=111b735a516af85ccdc4135d9df82c2e123009d61eb00f778b60af793b191c3165595f12f857fccf8fc4680324c44c505f04bbcd924eb3a14791bd690da53e204c2a972065f8551b |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121209052256/http://www.vanguardia.rne.es/FRONT_PROGRAMAS?go=111b735a516af85ccdc4135d9df82c2e123009d61eb00f778b60af793b191c3165595f12f857fccf8fc4680324c44c505f04bbcd924eb3a14791bd690da53e204c2a972065f8551b |archivedate=9 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In the previously referenced interview, he explained that everyone older than 52 years had to retire early, and that he was 54 years old at the time.

The decision to terminate the programs was widely criticized in Spanish-speaking blogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Angel |url=http://golemp.blogspot.com/2007/06/una-oscuridad-que-crece.html |title=GOLEM Blog: Una oscuridad que crece |publisher=Golemp.blogspot.com |date=11 July 2006 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://napalfoto.blogspot.com/2007/06/vanguardia-de-la-ciencia-se-despide.html |title=Napalius: Vanguardia de la ciencia se despide |publisher=Napalfoto.blogspot.com |date=26 June 2007 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sqysublog.blogspot.com/2007/06/el-fin-de-un-hermoso-sueo.html Bienvenido a mi mundo...: El fin de un hermoso sueño] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620002521/http://sqysublog.blogspot.com/2007/06/el-fin-de-un-hermoso-sueo.html |date=20 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lacasito |url=http://oncoloxiamolecular.blogspot.com/2007/06/el-sueo-de-arqumedes.html |title=Grupo de Oncoloxía Molecular: El sueño de Arquímedes |publisher=Oncoloxiamolecular.blogspot.com |date=28 February 2004 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rvr.blogalia.com/historias/50510 |title=Cuaderno de bitácora – Menos ciencia en RNE |publisher=Rvr.blogalia.com |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Francisco José Martinez |url=http://lectorblogs.blogspot.com/2007/06/el-sueo-de-arqu-y-vanguardia-de-la.html |title=Diario de un lector de blogs: El sueño de Arquímides y Vanguardia de la Ciencia |publisher=Lectorblogs.blogspot.com |date=27 February 2004 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/podcast-es/browse_thread/thread/e7ec10776dd535b5/7befce50149e9778?lnk=raot |title=Fin de un podcast – podcast-es &amp;#124; Google Groups |publisher=Google  |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Escrito por Josemi |url=http://www.zentolos.com/?p=331 |title=Blog Archive » Reestructuración de empresa |publisher=Zentolos |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Publicado por --3nder |url=http://binarybots.blogspot.com/2007/07/dime-que-es-un-sueo.html |title=BinaryBots: Dime que es un sueño |publisher=Binarybots.blogspot.com |date=11 July 2006 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Entertainment technology''' is the discipline of using manufactured or created components to enhance or make possible any sort of [[entertainment]] experience.  Because entertainment categories are so broad, and because entertainment models the world in many ways, the types of implemented technology are derived from a variety of sources.  Thus, in theatre, for example, entertainment technology practitioners must be able to design and construct [[scenery]], install electrical systems, build clothing, use motors if there is [[scenery automation]],{{clarify|date=January 2018}} provide plumbing (if functioning kitchen fixtures are required, or if "singing in the rain"), etc. In this way, the entertainment technology field intersects with most other types of technology.

Traditionally, entertainment technology is derived from theatrical [[stagecraft]], and stagecraft is an important subset of the discipline. However, the rise of new types and venues for entertainment, as well as rapidly advancing technological development, has increased the range and scope of its practice.

Entertainment technology includes:

*[[Scenery]] [[Manufacturing|fabrication]]
*[[Theatrical property|Properties]]
*[[Costume]]
*[[Lighting]]
*[[Sound]]
*[[Video]]
*[[Show control]]
*[[Automation]]
*[[Animatronics]]
*Interactive environments
*[[Computer simulation]]

In animation and game design, the phrase "entertainment technology" refers to a very real world of [[entertainment]] experiences made possible by the advent of primarily computer-mediated digital technologies.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

== History ==
Entertainment Technology can be traced back to the “Pre-digital Age.” The invention of the first phonograph machine, which is used to record and playback sound, dates back to 1877 by inventor Thomas Edison. There has been a significant progression from that antiquated modality of entertainment. From silent films (which also gave way to the art of creative storytelling using moving pictures) to the digital age, in which we now see growth on a global scale and, relative to earlier inventions, an extremely fast pace. By comparison, from the invention of the phonograph machine in 1877 to the invention of the first motion picture camera by Louis Lumiere in 1895 shows a gap of 18 years between significant entertainment technology inventions. Whereas compact discs were introduced in the 1980’s and within the next 10 years, satellite television was introduced. More recent developments in entertainment technology are sometimes considered to be a “race” in terms of which company will develop and distribute their product first. Knowing what we have available to us and where it all began can be used as a footnote in our ever-increasing development of entertainment and other technological advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6182692|title=IEEE Xplore Full-Text PDF:|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on Society ==
Society has completely been changed and advanced in many different ways by all the advancements in entertainment technology. Ranging from how companies get their product name out and get customers to buy into that product, to how people come into contact with one another and how we converse. Media and entertainment have become such a huge part of everyone’s life. We are all invested in some kind of media whether it is a tv show or a vlog and the producer of those are all very aware of the consumption of their product and will try to advertise it in as many ways as possible. They will reach out and promote their form of entertainment by having it on multiple platforms. Media companies will share their product on many different popular websites and forms of social media and ask its consumers to share it as well, generating more views and continuously advancing their products notoriety. Millions of dollars have been spent on Artificial Intelligence. Companies use AI because it is so detailed and precise with all of its obtained knowledge, they will use it to help market their brand because AI knows exactly what people like and what they want to see and will put together the final product that will succeed the most. Entertainment websites and websites that sell goods maintain and expand their viewers and customers by advertising something new you haven’t seen before when you are done with what you originally visited the website for. A big reason why a company became so successful and became so popular is that they bundled everything people want into a smaller collection, instead of having a much larger bundle that only included a couple items a consumer wants. Virtual reality is giving us a new way to experience the world. You can travel to see your favorite live event anywhere in the world without even having to leave your house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2017/04/25/top-six-digital-transformation-trends-in-media-and-entertainment/#311c80936729|title=Top Six Digital Transformation Trends In Media And Entertainment|last=Newman|first=Daniel|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-bringing-tv-life-digital-video-transformation-strategies|title=Digital Transformation in Media and Entertainment - Accenture|website=www.accenture.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples  ==

===== Virtual Reality =====
A three dimensional, computer generated simulation of a real seeming environment brought on by the use of special electronic equipment. This technology is used to replace the user’s entire real world environment with a computer generated (or simulated) one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.Overview.html|title=VIRTUAL REALITY - Overview|website=archive.ncsa.illinois.edu|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Augmented Reality   =====
An interactive technology that intertwines computer generated images with real world objects. These artificial images can align with or block the real world environment. This technology is used to alter the user’s perception of the real world which should not to be confused with virtual reality in which the user’s whole perception is changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macmillandictionary.com/buzzword/entries/augmented-reality.html|title=Augmented Reality - definition of Augmented Reality, Meaning of Augmented Reality, BuzzWord from Macmillan Dictionary.|website=www.macmillandictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== High Dynamic Range =====
A rich visual and audio experience that provides a greater contrast than standard dynamic range. This technology is most associated with display devices, sound recording, 3D rendering, and photography. Technology like this provides a more lifelike image in the visual aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/dynamic-range.htm|title=Understanding Dynamic Range in Digital Photography|website=www.cambridgeincolour.com|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Light Field Devices   =====
A device (usually a camera) that captures information about the light field that is emerging from a real life scene which is; the direction of the light rays in space and the intensity of the light in the actual environment/scene. This technology will someday surpass Virtual Reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117075834/http://www.time4.com/time4/microsites/popsci/howitworks/lightfield_camera.html|title=PopSci's How It Works - 100 Megapixel Camera|date=2008-01-17|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future Developments ==
Video streaming is becoming a huge part of society in this day and age and it’s only beginning to expand. Video streaming brought in a revenue of $30.29 billion in 2016 and based on projections conducted by Research and Markets, will reach an astonishing $70.05 billion in the year 2021. This projected drastic increase has caused there to be more competition in streaming, which has led to rapid growth, development, and a large increase in the amount of users. Technology is a data based driven field, and with this rapid growth the future is bright for this field. Technology has been enhancing discoveries for as long as it’s been invented. It holds the digital power to entertain, inform, and persuade. Technology will continue to provide all of these sentiments and will continue to do so for as long as developments keep forthcoming. Rapid growth and development does not only affect the consumers, but the producers. Large technology companies will have improve content quality of all while extracting maximum value of the product. Challenges for development in the media industry are how to maximize content, brands, and advertising. While also created tailoring consumers needs to enhance their experience. Consumers drive this field, companies are constantly running data about consumers preferences, relationships, habits, and locations. Technology is a growing field and with companies beginning to care more about the consumers, and with rapid growing development in this field, expect technology to take bigger steps forward in years to come.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/media-and-entertainment-industry-outlook-trends.html|title=2018 Media and Entertainment Industry Trends {{!}} Deloitte US|website=Deloitte United States|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-mission/technology-to-shape-the-future-of-media-entertainment-a1e3acd3b3ac|title=Technology to Shape the Future of Media &amp; Entertainment.|last=DataArt|date=2018-01-09|website=Medium|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Schools that offer programs or degrees in entertainment technology include:

* [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Entertainment Technology Center]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etc.cmu.edu/ Entertainment Technology Center].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[New York City College of Technology]], Department of Entertainment Technology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entertainmenttechnology.org/ Entertainment Technology], [[New York City College of Technology]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[University of Southern California]], Entertainment Technology Center&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinema.usc.edu/programs/entertainment-technology-center/ Entertainment Technology Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526035103/https://cinema.usc.edu/programs/entertainment-technology-center/ |date=2009-05-26 }}, [[University of Southern California]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tshwane University of Technology]], Pretoria, South Africa&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tut.ac.za/ Tshwane University of Technology], South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Entertainment Technology Training, New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toiwhakaari.ac.nz/study-at-toi-whakaari/entertainment-technology Entertainment Technology Training], New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently,{{when|date=January 2018}} the only university offering a degree specifically in Entertainment Engineering and Design (EED) is the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (UNLV).{{fact|date=January 2018}} Because UNLV's program is in its infancy, current entertainment technologists come from a wide variety of educational backgrounds, the most prevalent of which are theater and mechanical technology. Several other institutions of higher education offer similar programs for entertainment-related ventures.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

A bachelor's degree in these areas will typically have a difference of only a few specialized classes.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

Traditionally, people interested in careers in this field either presented themselves as apprentices within craft unions, or attended college programs in theatre technology. Although both are appropriate in limited ways, the growing world of entertainment technology encompasses many different types of performance and display environments than the theatre. To this end, newer opportunities have arisen that provide a wider educational base than these more traditional environments. An article "Rethinking Entertainment Technology Education" by John Huntington describes new teaching philosophies that resonate with the need for a richer and more flexible educational environment:&lt;ref name="huntington02"&gt;{{cite journal

{{quote|"We need to bridge the worlds of ivory-tower theatre education with the commercial world of live entertainment production. I believe this bridge would be beneficial not just to the technical students, but to the whole art of performance. When high-tech systems such as video, moving lights, computerized sound, mechanized scenery and show control are mastered by even average entertainment technicians, they can advance the state of their craft, which will allow artists to advance the state of their art."&lt;ref name="huntington02" /&gt;}}

'''Frances Elizabeth Hoggan''' (''née'' '''Morgan'''; 20 December 1843 – 5 February 1927) was a Welsh doctor and the first British woman to receive a doctorate in [[medicine]] from any university in [[Europe]]. She was also a pioneering medical practitioner, researcher and social reformer – and the first female doctor to be registered in [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr Frances Hoggan|url=https://www.learnedsociety.wales/medals/hoggan-medal/frances_hoggan/|website=Learned Society of Wales|accessdate=20 December 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025133745/https://www.learnedsociety.wales/medals/hoggan-medal/frances_hoggan/|archivedate=2017-10-25|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and her husband opened the first husband-and-wife medical practice in Britain.

==Life==
Frances Hoggan was born in [[Brecon]], [[Wales]], where her father, Richard Morgan, was a curate.  She was brought up and educated at [[Cowbridge]] in Glamorgan and later at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]].  During her teens, she gave birth to an illegitimate daughter, who was brought up with her mother and passed off as Frances' sister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/women/pages/mothers_of_industry.shtml BBC – Wales History – Mothers of Industry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  She went on to study at [[Paris]] and [[Düsseldorf]]. 

She obtained her medical doctorate from the [[University of Zurich]] in March 1870, completing the six-year course in three years, becoming the first British woman to obtain a European MD degree.&lt;ref&gt;Elston&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874 she married Dr George Hoggan.  She later practised in London as a specialist in women's and children's diseases, including a period at [[North London Collegiate School]].  Together with her husband, she opened the first husband-and-wife general medical practice in the UK.  

In 1882, she called for a publicly funded women's medical service for female patients in India. This helped pave the way for the [[Countess of Dufferin Fund|Dufferin Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medical Women for India|last=Hoggan|first=Frances|publisher=J.W. Arrowsmith|year=1882|isbn=|location=Bristol|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoggan became a campaigner and social reformer, and toured the [[United States]] lecturing. She had a particular interest in racial issues, and was a speaker at the Universal Race Congress in London in 1911.

Her cremated remains are buried, with her husband's, in [[Woking]] cemetery.

== Education ==
Upon the exclusion of women by the Council of the [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries]] from its professional exams in 1867, Frances Elizabeth Morgan sought her medical education at the [[University of Zurich]], whence [[Nadezhda Suslova]], Russia's first woman physician, had received her degree in December 1867. There, Morgan completed the medical course in three years rather than the expected five, and in March 1870 became only the second woman to gain an MD (with a thesis on progressive muscular atrophy) at Zürich University.&lt;ref&gt;Elston&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, at a clinic in Vienna she undertook study on operative midwifery and became a pupil of surgeon Gustav Braun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Frances Elizabeth Hoggan|last = Thomas|first = Onfel|publisher = R.

[[Israel]], the [[Palestinian territories]], and the [[Golan Heights]] also appear on the map, although they are not highlighted. Frozen conflict zones elsewhere in the world do not appear.]]
In [[international relations]], a '''frozen conflict''' is a situation in which [[war|active armed conflict]] has been brought to an end, but no [[peace treaty]] or other political framework resolves the conflict to the satisfaction of the combatants. Therefore, legally the conflict can start again at any moment, creating an environment of insecurity and instability.

The term has been commonly used for [[post-Soviet conflicts]], but it has also often been applied to other perennial [[territorial dispute]]s.&lt;ref name="tisdall"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/sep/22/frozen-conflict-spreads-across-globe |title=This dangerous new world of self-interested nations |author=Simon Tisdall |publisher=The Guardian |date=2010-09-22 |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?ots591=0c54e3b3-1e9c-be1e-2c24-a6a8c7060233&amp;lng=en&amp;id=133740 |title=North and South Korea: A Frozen Conflict on the Verge of Unfreezing? |publisher=Isn.ethz.ch |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/12494503 |title=Europe: Frozen conflicts |publisher=The Economist |date=2008-11-19 |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[de facto]]'' situation that emerges may match the ''[[de jure]]'' position asserted by one party to the conflict; for example, [[Russia]] claims and effectively controls [[Crimea]] following the [[2014 Crimean crisis]] despite [[Ukraine]]'s continuing claim to the region. Alternatively, the ''de facto'' situation may not match either side's official claim. The [[division of Korea]] is an example of the latter situation: both the [[Republic of Korea]] and the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] officially assert claims to the entire peninsula; however, there exists a well-defined border between the two countries' areas of control.

Frozen conflicts sometimes result in [[partially recognized state]]s. For example, the [[Republic of South Ossetia]], a product of the frozen [[Georgian–Ossetian conflict]], is [[International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia|recognized]] by eight other states, including five UN members; the other three of these entities are partially recognized states themselves.

==Examples==
{{History Of The Cold War}}
===In post-Soviet territories===
{{main|Post-Soviet conflicts}}
Following the [[breakup of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, a number of [[Post-Soviet conflicts|conflicts]] arose in areas of some of the [[post-Soviet states]], usually where the new international borders did not match the [[ethnic]] affiliations of local populations. These conflicts have largely remained "frozen", with disputed areas under the ''de facto'' control of entities other than the countries to which they are internationally recognized as belonging, and which still consider those areas to be part of their territory.

Since the ceasefire which ended the [[Transnistria War]] (1990–1992), the [[Russia]]n-influenced breakaway republic of [[Transnistria]] has controlled the easternmost strip of the territory of [[Moldova]]. The republic is internationally unrecognized, and Moldova continues to claim the territory.

Nagorno-Karabakh is a [[List of territorial disputes|disputed territory]], internationally recognized as part of [[Azerbaijan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://www.un.org/press/en/2008/ga10693.doc.htm|title=General Assembly adopts resolution reaffirming territorial integrity of Azerbaijan, demanding withdrawal of all Armenian forces|publisher=United Nations| date=14 March 2008| accessdate =30 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most of the region is governed by the [[Republic of Artsakh]] (formerly named Nagorno-Karabakh Republic), a ''de facto'' independent state with Armenian ethnic majority established on the basis of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] of the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]]. Azerbaijan has not exercised political authority over the region since the advent of the [[Karabakh movement]] in 1988. Since the end of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] in 1994, representatives of the governments of [[Armenia]] and Azerbaijan have been holding peace talks mediated by the [[OSCE Minsk Group]] on the region's disputed status.

The [[Abkhaz–Georgian conflict]] and [[Georgian–Ossetian conflict]] have led to the creation of two largely unrecognized states within the internationally recognized territory of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. The [[1991–92 South Ossetia War]] and the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–93)]], followed by the [[Russo-Georgian War]] of August 2008, have left the Russian-backed [[Republic of South Ossetia]] and [[Republic of Abkhazia]] in ''de facto'' control of the South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions in north and northwest Georgia.

In 2014, [[Crimea]] was occupied by the Russian troops without insignia while [[Ukraine]] was still recovering from large scale violence in the capital, and soon afterwards was admitted into the [[Russian Federation]]. This is widely regarded as an [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of the peninsula by Russia]], and is considered likely to result in another post-Soviet frozen conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/27/opinion/ukraine-crimea-russia/ Will Ukraine's Crimea region be Europe's next 'frozen' conflict?], CNN, Feb 28, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; While there are similarities between Transnistria, Abkhazia and the 2014–2015 [[War in Donbass]], where the unrecognized [[Donetsk People's Republic]] and [[Lugansk People's Republic]] have taken ''de facto'' control of areas in the [[Donbass]] region in eastern Ukraine, the conflict in Donbass is not a frozen conflict yet as ceasefire violations are keeping the fighting on a low burner. However, some experts predict a frozen future for this conflict as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepoliticon.net/analytics/291-ukraine-towards-a-frozen-future.html Rusif Huseynov.

===Others in Asia===
[[India]] and [[Pakistan]] have fought at least three wars over the disputed region of [[Kashmir]] in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], and [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1999|1999]]. India claims the entire area of the former princely state of [[Kashmir and Jammu (princely state)|Kashmir and Jammu]], of which it administers approximately 43%. Its claims are contested by Pakistan, which controls approximately 37% of the region and urges for plebiscite in Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1209319 | title=PM Nawaz urges Ban Ki-moon for plebiscite in Kashmir | date=28 September 2015 | work=Dawn | accessdate=23 March 2017 | author=Irfan Haider}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pkkh"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.defence.pk/forums/central-south-asia/233237-pak-india-dialogue-single-point-agenda-kashmir-pkkh-tv.html| title=PAK-INDIA Dialogue: Single-Point-Agenda: KASHMIR | date=4 February 2013 | agency=PKKH | accessdate=18 August 2013 | author=Durrani, Atiq}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining territory is controlled by the People's Republic of China, with which India is again in dispute and have fought the [[Sino-Indian War]].

The [[Cross-Strait relations|conflict between mainland China and Taiwan]] remains frozen since 1949. Both the [[People's Republic of China]] in the Mainland and the [[Republic of China]] in [[Taiwan]] consider the other to be part of its territory. While the latter especially is not recognized by a majority of countries and states internationally, it remains a ''de facto'' independent administration in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, and PRC's ''de facto'' administration remains in the Mainland.

The [[division of Korea]] was frozen from 1953, when a ceasefire ended the [[Korean War]]; until 27 April 2018, when the two countries agreed to [[April 2018 inter-Korean summit|end the war]] formally. Both [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] governments claim the entire peninsula, while ''de facto'' control is divided along the military demarcation line in the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]].

Hostilities of the 1991 [[Gulf War]] ended when the [[United Nations]] and [[Iraq]] signed a [[ceasefire]] agreement on April 3, 1991; Kuwait was liberated from being annexed by Iraq and its sovereignty was recognized by the latter. Due to sporadic conflicts through the [[Iraqi no-fly zones]], the war remained frozen for the time being until 12 years later when the [[United States]] and its "[[Coalition of the willing]]" launched the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] and removed dictator [[Saddam Hussein]] from power over the non-compliance with [[List of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning Iraq|UN Resolutions passed against Iraq]] following the 1991 war.

The [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] is a perennial conflict between [[Israel]] and its Arab neighbours, including the [[Palestinian territories]]. Israel refuses to recognize [[Palestinian statehood]] without an assured peace deal, while some Arab countries and groups refuse to recognize Israel. Israel has ''de facto'' control of [[East Jerusalem]] and claims it as its integral territory, although it is not internationally recognized as such. Similarly most of the [[Golan Heights]] are currently under ''de facto'' Israeli control and civil administration, whereas the international community rejects that claim.

===Others in Europe and Africa===
The dispute over the [[Kosovo status process|status of Kosovo]] remains frozen since the end of the [[Kosovo War]], fought in 1998–1999 between Yugoslav forces ([[Serbia and Montenegro|FR Yugoslavia]]) and the ethnically Albanian [[Kosovo Liberation Army]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5208">'''Global civics''' suggests to understand [[civics]] in a global sense as a [[social contract]] among all [[world citizen]]s in an age of interdependence and interaction. The disseminators of the concept define it as the notion that we have certain rights and responsibilities towards each other by the mere fact of being human on Earth.&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altinay |first=Hakan |title=The Case for Global Civics |journal=Global Economy and Development at Brookings |year=2010 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603104201/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |archivedate=2010-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advocates of the notion attempt to demonstrate that it is possible to imagine global civics. According to this notion, in an increasingly interdependent world, the [[world citizen]]s need a compass that would frame mindsets on a global scale, and create a shared consciousness and sense of global responsibility related to specific world issues such as environmental problems and nuclear proliferation.&lt;ref name = feasible&gt;{{cite journal | last = Altinay| first = Hakan| title= A Global Civics: Necessary? Feasible?| journal = Global Policy| date = June 2010| url = http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/articles/international-law-and-human-rights/global-civics-necessary-feasible}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==

The term '''global civics''' was first coined by Hakan Altinay, a nonresident senior fellow with the Global Economy and Development program at the [[Brookings Institution]], in a working paper published in March 2010. The concept builds upon the basic tenets behind [[global ethics]], [[global justice]] and [[world citizenship]], inviting everyone to question their increasingly important role in a highly interdependent world. In early 2011, Altinay published ''Global Civics: Responsibilities and Rights in an Interdependent World,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title =Global Civics: Rights and Responsibilities in an Interdependent World| last=Altinay| first=Hakan| year = 2011 | publisher= Brookings Institution Press | location= Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a book of articles on global civics put forth by academics and intellectuals all around the world.

==Objections to the concept==
Opponents of the global civics concept argue that even a modest level of exercising responsibility towards all the people living in the world is so overwhelming and nearly impossible to achieve. These arguments also posit that [[civics]] assumes an effective state and enforcement. The claim goes that since there is no such thing as a [[world government]], global civics implementation is not feasible. Also, it has been suggested that superpowers of the world are selfish and dangerous nations, and that they do not feel constrained by international legitimacy and laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Dangerous Nations|last= Kagan|first= Robert|year= 2006 | publisher= Alfred A. Knopf | location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the critics claim that any experience of pan-global solidarity among human beings cannot form the basis of constellation of rights and responsibilities as it is nascent at best and the experience of being a global citizen is a privilege restricted to international elites and a few activists.&lt;ref name = feasible/&gt;

==The role of universities==

The proponents of global civics also suggest that university campuses play a vital role in spreading a thorough understanding of how today's global world functions and contributes toward preparation of future generations for life in an interdependent world. This view calls for visionary universities that could successfully "provide their students with the forums and the tools to discuss and figure out what their responsibilities are to their fellow human beings." &lt;ref name = case/&gt;

The '''Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research''' ('''HIIK''') is an independent and interdisciplinary registered association located at the Department of Political Science at the [[University of Heidelberg]]. Since 1991, the HIIK has been committed to the distribution of knowledge about the emergence, course and settlement of interstate and intrastate political conflicts. The Conflict Barometer is published annually and contains the current research results.

== Conflict Barometer ==
The HIIK's annual publication '''Conflict Barometer''' describes the recent trends in global conflict developments, escalations, de-escalations, and settlements. [[Coup d'état]], attempted coups d'états, as well as implemented measures of conflict resolution are also reported. It is subdivided into five world regions and presents all present conflicts in detailed charts and short descriptions. The methodological approach consists of the conflict definition and the measuring of the conflict intensity.

== Methodology after 2011 ==
Following a methodological revision in 2011, changes in the Heidelberg methodology included allocating intensities not only based on state units and calendar years, but also on the level of subnational units and calendar months. Furthermore, the establishment of intensities now follows an analysis of clearly conceived proxy indicators, used for the assessment of means and consequences of a conflict measure. This analysis continues to be based on the actions of conflict actors, as well as the communication between them. Through the conceptual refinement and standardization of data collection and documentation, the HIIK data achieves a higher degree of precision, reliability, and comprehensibility regarding information on political conflicts.

== Conflict definition ==
A political conflict is a positional difference between at least two assertive and directly involved actors regarding values relevant to a society (the conflict items including (territory, [[secession]], [[decolonization]], [[autonomy]], [[Ideology|system/ideology]], [[national power]], [[regional predominance]], [[international power]], [[Resource (economics)|resources]], other)) which is carried out using observable and interrelated conflict measures that lie outside established regulatory procedures and threaten core state functions, the international order, or hold the prospect of doing so.
	According to the Heidelberg (1998) methodology and ideology, the essence of a political conflict lies in a contradiction, adequately represented by the concept of a “positional difference”: a positional difference is a perceived incompatibility of ideas and beliefs. It presupposes the presence of the following elements:
(1) There must be at least two entities possessing intellectual capacity and vision, and who are capable of communicating. Such an entity is called an actor.
(2) In order for the actors to sense incompatibility between their ideas and beliefs, there must be reciprocal actions and acts of communication between said actors. These actions and acts of communication are called measures.
(3) A communicating act always refers to a specific issue, an action always refers to a certain object. The subject behind a measure is called item.
For the purpose of defining the term political conflict more precisely, the three elements aforementioned shall be further defined. These elements are necessary requirements for the existence of a political conflict.

== Conflict intensities ==

| A political conflict is classified as a non-violent crisis if physical violence is being implicitly or explicitly threatened to persons or property by at least one of the actors, or if one actor uses physical violence against property, without regarding the injury of people as acceptable. A threat of force is understood as a verbally or non-verbally communicated prospect of violent measures that is based on the conflict item. An acceptance of the injury of persons is present when the use of force against property includes the possibility of the injury of people but the violator is indifferent to this possibility.

Throughout history and in many cultures, children have been extensively involved in military campaigns.&lt;ref name="Wessells" /&gt;

The earliest mentions of minors being involved in wars come from antiquity. It was customary for youths in the Mediterranean basin to serve as aides, charioteers and armor bearers to adult warriors. Examples of this practice can be found in the Bible, such as David's service to King Saul, in Hittite and ancient Egyptian art, and in ancient Greek [[Greek mythology|mythology]] (such as the story of Hercules and Hylas), philosophy and literature.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In a practice dating back to antiquity, children were routinely taken on a campaign, together with the rest of a military man's family, as part of the baggage.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The Roman Empire made use of youths in war, though it was understood that it was unwise and cruel to use children in war, and Plutarch implies that regulations required youths to be at least sixteen years of age.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Despite this, several Roman [[Legionary|legionaries]] were known to have enlisted aged 14 in the [[Imperial Roman army]], such as Quintus Postunius Solus who completed 21 years of service in [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix]], and Caecilius Donatus who served 26 years in the Legio XX and died shortly before his honorable discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cowan |first=Ross |authorlink=Ross Cowan |ref=harv |title=Roman Legionary AD 69–161 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKudCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=de#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date=2013 |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |location=[[Oxford]] |isbn=978-1780965871 |page=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval Europe young boys from about twelve years of age were used as military aides ("[[squires]]"), though in theory their role in actual combat was limited. The so-called [[Children's Crusade]] in 1212 recruited thousands of children as untrained soldiers under the assumption that divine power would enable them to conquer the enemy, although none of the children entered combat. According to the legend, they were instead sold into slavery. While most scholars no longer believe that the Children's Crusade consisted solely, or even mostly, of children, it nonetheless exemplifies an era in which entire families took part in a war effort.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Young boys often took part in battles during early modern warfare. When Napoleon was faced with invasion by a massive Allied force in 1814 he conscripted many teenagers for his armies. Orphans of the Imperial Guard fought in the Netherlands with Marshal MacDonald and were between the ages of 14 and 17.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Leggiere, The Fall of Napoleon: The Allied Invasion of France 1813–1814, pg.99–100&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the conscripts who reported to the ranks in 1814 were referred to as Marie Louises after the Empress Marie Louise of France; they were also known as "The Infants of the Emperor". These soldiers were in their mid-teens.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Pope, Dictionary of the Napoleonic Wars, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; One of their more visible roles was as the ubiquitous "[[Drummer boy (military)|drummer boy]]".

During the age of sail, young boys formed part of the crew of British Royal Navy ships and were responsible for many essential tasks including bringing powder and shot from the [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazines|ship's magazine]] to the gun crews. These children were called "powder monkeys."{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

[[File:Child soldier in the US Civil War.jpg|thumb|upright|Drummer boy [[John Clem]] during the American Civil War.]]

By a law signed by Nicholas I of Russia in 1827 a disproportionate number of Jewish boys, known as the [[cantonist]]s, were forced into military training establishments to serve in the army. The 25-year conscription term officially commenced at the age of 18, but boys as young as eight were routinely taken to fulfill the quota. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In the final stages of the Paraguayan War, children fought in the Battle of Acosta Ñu against the Allied forces of Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. The day is commemorated as a national holiday in Paraguay.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

During the Boshin War, the pro-''shōgun'' Aizu Domain formed the {{nihongo|''[[Byakkotai]]''|白虎隊|extra="[[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|White Tiger]] Force"}}, which was made up of the 16 to 17-year-old sons of Aizu samurai. During the Battle of Bonari Pass and the Battle of Aizu they fought the Satcho forces who supported the Imperial cause. A detached unit of Byakkotai was cut off from the rest of the unit and retreated to Iimori Hill, which overlooked Aizu-Wakamatsu Castle. From there, they saw what they thought was the castle on fire. 20 of the detached unit committed ''seppuku'' while [[Iinuma Sadakichi|one was unsuccessful]]. He was saved by a local peasant.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In the West, boys [[Youngest British soldier in World War I|as young as 12]] were caught up in the overwhelming tide of patriotism and in huge numbers enlisted for active service. Others enlisted to avoid harsh and dreary lives. Typically many were able to pass themselves off as older men, such as George Thomas Paget, who at 17 joined a [[Bantam (military)|Bantam]] battalion in the Welsh Regiment. The last surviving combat veteran of the War was [[Claude Choules]], who enlisted in the [[Royal Navy]] at age 14 and saw his first action at the Battle of Jutland at 15.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In the Gallipoli campaign, otherwise known as "Çanakkale", children as young as 15 fought in the trenches. 120 children fought in the "15'liler" or "The 15s" company, with no known survivors.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Spanish Civil War==
Many child soldiers fought in the Spanish Civil War:
{{quote|The centuria was an untrained mob composed mostly of boys in their teens. Here and there in the militia you came across children as young as eleven or twelve, usually refugees from Fascist territory who had been enlisted as militiamen as the easiest way of providing for them. As a rule, they were employed on light work in the rear, but sometimes they managed to worm their way to the front line, where they were a public menace. I remember one little brute throwing a hand-grenade into the dug-out fire 'for a joke'. At Monte Pocero I do not think there was anyone younger than fifteen, but the average age must have been well under twenty. Boys of this age ought never to be used in the front line, because they cannot stand the lack of sleep which is inseparable from trench warfare. At the beginning it was almost impossible to keep our position properly guarded at night. The wretched children of my section could only be roused by dragging them out of their dug-outs feet foremost, and as soon as your back was turned they left their posts and slipped into shelter; or they would even, in spite of the frightful cold, lean up against the wall of the trench and fall fast asleep.|||George Orwell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=George |last=Orwell |title=Homage to Catalonia {{!}} Chapter 3 |url=http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/2.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318152354/http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/2.html |archivedate=18 March 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{main|Military use of children in World War II}}

In [[World War II]] children under the age of 18 were widely used by all sides in formal and informal military roles. Children were readily indoctrinated into the prevailing ideology of the warring parties, quickly trained, and often sent to the front line; many were wounded or killed. The lack of a legal definition of a child, combined with the absence of a system for verifying the ages of prospective child recruits, contributed to the extensive use of children in the war.

==== Algeria ====
During the [[Algerian Civil War|Algerian civil war]] (1991–2002) children were recruited frequently by [[Islamism|Islamist]] armed groups fighting the government.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=adc88bff-1916-4317-b184-d9079e7b0bb8|title=Global Report on Child Soldiers|last=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers|first=|date=2001|website=child-soldiers.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A government-allied militia—the Legitimate Defence Groups (LDG)—also used children, according to some reports.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=c5f157d3-4b56-457c-a2d8-31601ffc1b9e|title=Child Soldiers Global Report 2004|last=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers|first=|date=2004|website=child-soldiers.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rules for joining the LDG were the same as the army, in which only adults were recruited (by [[conscription]]) the LDG applied no safeguards to ensure that children could not join up.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The extent of child recruitment during the war remains unknown.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

By 2006, a [[Disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration|reintegration program]] organized by [[UNICEF]] had led to the release of 3,000 children from the military and armed groups.&lt;ref name=":37" /&gt; According to Child Soldiers International:&lt;blockquote&gt;The majority of those [children] who took part in the program returned to farm and fish in their local communities, but nearly 600 returned to school.

Between 2007 and 2012, children were used extensively by the Chadian military as participants in armed conflict.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://childsoldiersworldindex.org/view/TD|title=Child Soldiers World Index: Chad|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2018|website=childsoldiersworldindex.org|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330013128/http://childsoldiersworldindex.org/view/TD|archive-date=30 March 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-03-29|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also integrated into various rebel forces, including the [[United Front for Democratic Change]] (''Front Uni pour le Changement'', FUC), local self-defense forces known as ''Tora Boro'' militias, and two Sudanese rebel movements operating in Chad: the [[Justice and Equality Movement]] (JEM) and the G-19 faction of the Sudanese Liberation Army (SLA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2007/chad0107/|title=They Came Here to Kill Us|date=January 2007|publisher=Human Rights Watch|access-date=29 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328114459/https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/chad0107//|archive-date=28 March 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2007/chad0707/|title=Early To War|date=July 2007|publisher=Human Rights Watch|access-date=29 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016121224/https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/chad0707/|archive-date=16 October 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the government signed an action plan with the United Nations, children were released from service and were no longer recruited. By 2014, Chad had been removed from the UN list of countries that use child soldiers in war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Côte d'Ivoire ====
During [[First Ivorian Civil War|Côte d’Ivoire’s civil war]] of 2002–2004, "children were recruited, often forcibly, by both sides",&lt;ref name="CSUCS-1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091226221427/http://www.child-soldiers.org/document/get?id=743 Child soldiers global report 2004: Africa Regional overview], [http://www.child-soldiers.org/contact/contact Child Soldiers International] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070703045854/http://www.child-soldiers.org/contact/contact|date=3 July 2007}}.&lt;!--Retrieved April 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and were also abducted by armed groups fighting the civil war in Liberia between 1999 and 2003.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The ''Patriotic Youth –'' armed groups that included children in large numbers – received the active support of the government.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Thousands of children saw membership of an armed group on either side of the war as a way to earn a living,&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=26c0549d-aa35-4f1a-8e34-5956f8e2ec51|title=Child Soldiers Global Report 2008|last=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers|first=|date=2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they were often unpaid, having to acquire money through extortion or begging.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; They were provided with automatic weapons, and girls were frequently abducted as sex slaves.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Attempts to reach a peace agreement repeatedly failed, and although after 2006 children were gradually released from military groups, approximately 2,000 children remained.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; After President [[Laurent Gbagbo]] refused to recognise the 2010 election result, fighting flared up again and child recruitment increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2013/245&amp;Lang=E&amp;Area=UNDOC|title=Report of the Secretary-General: Children and armed conflict (2013)|last=UN General Assembly|first=|date=2013|website=www.un.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the new government, however, the UN brokered an Action Plan that included the release of all children and, in 2015, the UN reported that children were no longer recruited in the country.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2015/409&amp;Lang=E&amp;Area=UNDOC|title=Report of the Secretary-General: Children and armed conflict|last=UN General Assembly|first=|date=2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Eritrea ====
During its [[Eritrean War of Independence|30-year war for independence with Ethiopia]] (1961–1991) the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front|Eritrean People’s Liberation Front]] was "widely acknowledged" to have used children extensively as soldiers, according to the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers (now [[Child Soldiers International]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/global-report-2001|title=Child Soldiers Global Report: 2001|last=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers|first=|date=2001|website=|page=162|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402040002/https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/global-report-2001|archive-date=2 April 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-05-24|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Once independence had been won, the Eritrean armed forces recruited and used children again during the [[Eritrean–Ethiopian War|two-year border war]] with Ethiopia in 1998.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There were many reports of child recruitment and use (including conscription from age 15)&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;, but there is little information today about the extent of the practice, which is due in part to the absence of effective birth registration and age-verification system at the time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The UN reported in 2002 that children were no longer being used systematically by the Eritrean armed forces,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2002/03/30852-un-envoy-reports-no-evidence-child-soldiering-ethiopia-and-eritrea|title=UN envoy reports no evidence of ‘child soldiering’ in Ethiopia and Eritrea|last=|first=|date=2002-03-26|work=UN News|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180708074728/https://news.un.org/en/story/2002/03/30852-un-envoy-reports-no-evidence-child-soldiering-ethiopia-and-eritrea|archive-date=8 July 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the government acceded to the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict in 2005. Child recruitment continued, however; Human Rights Concern Eritrea reported in 2013 that all schoolchildren in 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade (approx. age 16) were made to spend the year at a military training camp, after which they were routinely recruited into the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hrc-eritrea.org/report-on-child-rights-violations-in-eritrea/|title=Report on Child Rights Violations in Eritrea|last=Human Rights Concern Eritrea|first=|date=19 November 2013|website=hrc-eritrea.org|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718154539/http://hrc-eritrea.org/report-on-child-rights-violations-in-eritrea/|archive-date=18 July 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-05-24|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ethiopia ====
According to the [[Child Soldiers International|Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers]] in 2001 there were "credible reports" that the Ethiopian armed forces used thousands of children in its [[Eritrean–Ethiopian War|two-year border war]] with Eritrea between 1998 and 2000:&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/global-report-2001|title=Child Soldiers Global Report: 2001|last=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers|first=|date=2001|website=|page=165|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402040002/https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/global-report-2001|archive-date=2 April 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-05-24|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Testimonies of former child soldiers, NGOs and journalists provide evidence of child deployment on the [[Front line|front lines]] and in [[Human wave attack|massive waves]] across mine fields... Recruitment reportedly focused on Oromos and Somalis... and on grades 9 to 12 of secondary schools.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Children were also forcibly recruited in groups from public places.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The lack of a functioning birth registration system has made it difficult to estimate the number of children affected, but it is clear that the use of children was widespread; for example, most Ethiopian prisoners of war in one large [[prisoner of war]] camp in Eritrea were estimated to be aged 14–18.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The main opposition group in the 1990s, the [[Oromo Liberation Front]], also systematically recruited children, including by force.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 2008 it was reported that children were no longer used for military purposes in Ethiopia,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and in 2014 the government ratified the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://childsoldiersworldindex.org/view/ET|title=Child Soldiers World Index: Ethiopia|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2017|website=childsoldiersworldindex.org|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525062600/http://childsoldiersworldindex.org/view/ET|archive-date=25 May 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-05-24|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Liberia’s civil wars (1989–1995, 1999–2003) all factions abducted children for direct combat, forced labour, and sexual slavery.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It was the common practice of commanders to give children drugs and threaten them with execution in order to enhance their obedience; for example, soldiers were frequently given [[Diazepam|valium]] before a battle, known as "bubbles" or "10-10".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?verb=sr&amp;csi=5774&amp;sr=HEADLINE(Boy+soldiers)%2BAND%2BDATE%2BIS%2B1995|title=Boy Soldiers|last=Frankel|first=Mark|date=14 August 1995|work=Newsweek|access-date=19 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220033458/http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?verb=sr&amp;csi=5774&amp;sr=HEADLINE(Boy+soldiers)%2BAND%2BDATE%2BIS%2B1995|archive-date=20 February 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children were often persuaded or forced to commit grave human rights violations against civilians, including rape, torture, and the abduction of other children for military use.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Children as young as 10 were used in direct combat.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

United Nations [[Rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers|disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration]] programs repeatedly failed when children quitted them, often to return to their former military unit, and after fighters rioted in protest at the absence of a financial reward for being disarmed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A chronic lack of resources for reintegration also prompted child soldiers to enrol in other armed groups as a means of gainful employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Children and families affected by armed conflicts in Africa|last=Corbin|first=Joanne|publisher=NASW Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004 more than 20,000 children needed to be demobilised and reunited with their communities.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, by October 2004 10,000 children had been released from their military units and were part of reintegration programs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

By 2006 children were no longer being used by any military groups in the country, although armed groups from Côte d'Ivoire and Guinea continued to abduct Liberian children.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; {{As of|2018}}, children were no longer being used for military purposes in Liberia, and its armed forces were recruiting only adults over the age of 18.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://childsoldiersworldindex.org/view/SL|title=Child Soldiers World Index: Sierra Leone|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2018|website=childsoldiersworldindex.org|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180517010103/http://childsoldiersworldindex.org/view/SL|archive-date=17 May 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-05-16|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 20,000 children took part in hostilities during the 1990s, including the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide|Rwanda genocide]] when many children were involved in committing atrocities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 5,000 children were in the national army,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; while others, including many street children, joined or were made to join armed groups.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; After the genocide, 4,500 children were detained on suspicion of participating in atrocities, and were incarcerated for several years without charge or trial;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; some were sent to the Gitagata Re-Education Centre for males below 14 years of age.&lt;ref name=":101"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/The%20Use%20of%20Children%20as%20Soldiers%20in%20Africa%20report.pdf|title=The Use of Children as Soldiers in Africa report|last=Jaffré|first=Françoise|date=21 January 2015|website=ReliefWeb|access-date=18 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220092236/https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/The%20Use%20of%20Children%20as%20Soldiers%20in%20Africa%20report.pdf|archive-date=20 February 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, children were widely recruited again, often by force, to fight in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).&lt;ref name="CSUCS-12"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091226221427/http://www.child-soldiers.org/document/get?id=743 Child soldiers global report 2004: Africa Regional overview], [http://www.child-soldiers.org/contact/contact Child Soldiers International] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070703045854/http://www.child-soldiers.org/contact/contact|date=3 July 2007}}.&lt;!--Retrieved April 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial demobilisation and reintegration programmes failed after many schools banned former child soldiers&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and a high rate of unemployment rendered them vulnerable to re-recruitment by militia groups.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In 2003, as the Rwandan military presence in the DRC reduced, so did the demand for child soldiers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The government introduced new legislation to raise the minimum enlistment age 18 and the armed forces stopped recruiting children.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Nonetheless, armed groups continued to do so, albeit to a reduced extent, for their operations in the DRC.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

====Sierra Leone====
{{Main|Child soldiers in Sierra Leone}}
During the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] (1991–2002) thousands of children were recruited by government armed forces and non-government armed groups, particularly the anti-government [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF) and the [[Armed Forces Revolutionary Council]] (AFRC), and the pro-government [[Civil Defence Forces]] (CDF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/04/11/armed-conflict-sierra-leone|title=The Armed Conflict in Sierra Leone|last=Human Rights Watch|first=|date=2012-04-11|work=|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022164329/https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/04/11/armed-conflict-sierra-leone|archive-date=22 October 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children were often forcibly recruited, given drugs and used to commit atrocities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Thousands of girls were also recruited as soldiers and often subjected to sexual exploitation. Many of the children were survivors of attacks on villages, which were routinely ordered to hand over their children to armed groups.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; By 2001, an estimated 10,000 children were being used for military purposes by government armed forces and various armed groups, particularly the RUF.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

After 2002, when the war was declared over, an extensive United Nations [[Rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers|disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration]] programme reunited most former child soldiers with their communities, although it drew criticism for neglecting the needs of women and girls.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In June 2007 the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]] found three men from the rebel Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other serious violations of international humanitarian law, including the recruitment of children under the age of 15 years into the armed forces. With this the Special Court became the first ever UN-backed tribunal to secure a conviction for the military conscription of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sc-sl.org/Press/pressrelease-062007.pdf|title="Guilty Verdicts in the Trial of the AFRC Accused"|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029201800/http://www.sc-sl.org/Press/pressrelease-062007.pdf|archivedate=29 October 2008|deadurl=yes|df=}}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(104&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, press release from the Special Court for Sierra Leone, 20 June 2007; [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/20/AR2007062000952.html?hpid=moreheadlines "Sierra Leone Convicts 3 of War Crimes"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003183441/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/20/AR2007062000952.html?hpid=moreheadlines |date=3 October 2018 }}, ''[[Associated Press]]'', 20 June 2007 (hosted by ''[[The Washington Post]]''); {{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6221112.stm|title=First S Leone war crimes verdicts|date=20 June 2007|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=21 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122151146/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6221112.stm|archive-date=22 November 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Salvadoran Civil War|civil war between 1980 and 1992]] the Salvadoran military and the main opposition group, the ''[[Frente Farabundo Martí de Liberación Nacional|Frente Farabundo Martí de Liberación National]]'' (FMLN)'','' recruited children extensively. The recruitment was frequently carried out by force and focused on economically suppressed regions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A fifth of the army’s personnel were aged under 18, as were a quarter of the FMLN.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/experiences-and-psychocial-impact-of-the-el-salvador-civil-war-on-child-soldiers|title=Experiences and psychocial impact of the El Salvador civil war on child soldiers|last=Santacruz|first=Maria|last2=Arana|first2=Rubi|date=2002|website=Child Soldiers International|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180522043014/https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/experiences-and-psychocial-impact-of-the-el-salvador-civil-war-on-child-soldiers|archive-date=22 May 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-05-21|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a group of 278 former FMLN child soldiers interviewed for a study, the average age of recruitment was 10 years.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The large majority of child recruits on both sides were living in poverty, and had been largely deprived of formal education.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Many children who were not recruited by force joined of their own volition, mainly either to improve their circumstances or because they believed in the cause.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

After the civil war came to a close, [[Rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers|rehabilitation and reintegration programmes]] for children mostly failed; the majority of FMLN children were not involved in them, and the large majority of those who were dropped out of them.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; A decade after the peace accord former child soldiers were still experiencing nightmares, depression, anxiety, and related signs of psychiatric trauma.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

[[File:Khmer Rouge.JPG|thumb|Child dressed as ''[[Khmer Rouge]]'' soldier.]]
In the 1970s the ''[[Khmer Rouge]]'' exploited thousands of desensitised, conscripted children in their early teens to commit mass murder and other atrocities during the [[Cambodian Civil War|Cambodian civil war]] and [[Cambodian genocide|subsequent genocide]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/features/blogs/cambodiablog/blog6_cambodia_southerland-20060720.html|title=Cambodia Diary 6: Child Soldiers — Driven by Fear and Hate|last=Southerland|first=D|date=2006-07-20|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320105641/https://www.rfa.org/english/features/blogs/cambodiablog/blog6_cambodia_southerland-20060720.html|archive-date=20 March 2018|dead-url=no|accessdate=2018-03-28|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indoctrinated children were taught to follow any order without hesitation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; After it was deposed in 1979, the ''Khmer Rouge'' fought a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] against the new government, and until at least 1998 relied heavily on child recruits, including forced recruitment by abduction.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; During this period, the children were deployed mainly in unpaid support roles, such as ammunition-carriers, and also as combatants.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Cambodia's state armed forces also recruited children widely. Throughout the 1990s the army was recruiting children from the age of 10 and using them in armed conflict, mainly as porters and spies, and also as combatants.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Four percent of the army were children, according to an estimate in the ''[[The Cambodia Daily|Cambodia Daily]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=adc88bff-1916-4317-b184-d9079e7b0bb8|title=Cambodia Daily|last=|first=|date=2001|work=Cambodia Daily|access-date=2018-05-21|via=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers: 'Child Soldiers Global Report: 2001'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many children had fled the ''Khmer Rouge'' without a means to feed themselves and hoped that joining the government forces would enable them to survive, although local commanders frequently denied them any pay.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Children often capitalised on the lack of an effective birth registration system to lie about their age in order to enlist.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Other children, some as young as 8, were forced to join.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

By 2000, the Cambodian government had signed the [[Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict]] and its armed forces resolved to recruit adults only.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Meanwhile, the ''Khmer Rouge'' had collapsed with the death of its leader, [[Pol Pot]], in 1998.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; By 2004, children were no longer being recruited in the country, although the [[Rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers|demobilisation programmes]] were inadequate, according to [[UNICEF]], failing to offer appropriate rehabilitative support to released children.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Between 1983 and 2009 Sri Lanka’s government fought a civil war with the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (Tamil Tigers). For its entire duration the Tamil Tigers and other armed groups made routine use of child recruits, typically aged 14–17 and sometimes under 10.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ZN"&gt;Bureau Report ''[http://www.zeenews.com/znnew/articles.asp?aid=331811&amp;sid=SAS LTTE rebels make child recruitment illegal: Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930205926/http://www.zeenews.com/znnew/articles.asp?aid=331811&amp;sid=SAS |date=30 September 2007 }}'', [[Zee News]] 27 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Some children enlisted to escape deprivation or racism, or during compulsory military training at their school when they were exposed to recruitment propaganda.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Others were recruited by force when walking home from school or after the Tigers pressurised families to surrender one child, as per its policy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In 2001, international sources estimated that 40 percent of Tamil Tiger personnel were children, contrary to official statements insisting that the organisation did not use them.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Sri Lankan soldiers nicknamed one unit the "Baby Battalion", due to the number of children in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928090515/http://www.lankaeverything.com/printnews.php?pid=20060918001845.php|title=Sri Lanka Tamil Tigers abduct teens to fight|last=LankaEverything.com|first=|date=2006-09-18|website=web.archive.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although state armed forces recruited only adults over the age of 18, they supported the [[Karuna group]], a Tamil splinter organisation opposed to the Tamil Tigers, to recruit children by force.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The government also used detained Tamil Tiger children for propaganda by exposing them to the media.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The first international initiative to demobilise and reintegrate children into their communities began in 2003, but was halted in 2004 because the Tigers failed to keep their commitment to release children from their ranks.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The organisation began to release children in 2004, but continued to enlist several thousand, albeit in progressively smaller numbers, until at least 2007.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The Tamil Tigers were defeated in 2009 and all other parties to the conflict stopped recruiting children in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2011/250&amp;Lang=E&amp;Area=UNDOC|title=Children and Armed Conflict: Annual Report of the Secretary-General, 2011|last=UN General Assembly|first=|date=2011|website=www.un.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180518200355/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S%2F2011%2F250&amp;Lang=E&amp;Area=UNDOC|archive-date=18 May 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-05-25|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of the [[family]]''' is a branch of [[social history]] that concerns the [[sociocultural evolution]] of [[kinship]] groups from prehistoric to modern times.&lt;ref name="Hareven 1991, p. 95."&gt;Hareven 1991, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The family has a universal and basic role in all societies.&lt;ref&gt;van den Berghe 1979, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Research on the history of the family crosses disciplines and cultures, aiming to understand the structure and function of the family from many viewpoints.  For example, [[sociological]], [[ecological]] or [[economical]] perspectives are used to view the interrelationships between the individual, their relatives, and the historical time.&lt;ref name="Hareven 1991, p. 95." /&gt; The study of family history has shown that family systems are flexible, culturally diverse and adaptive to ecological and economical conditions.&lt;ref&gt;van den Berghe 1979, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Definition of family==
Family defined as the co-residence and the organization by kinship are both integral in the development of the concept of the family. A co-residential group that makes up a household may share general survival goals and a residence, but may not fulfill the varied and sometimes ambiguous requirements for the definition of a family.

==Historiography==
The history of the family emerged as a separate field of history in the 1970s, with close ties to anthropology and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Tamara K. Hareven, "The history of the family and the complexity of social change," ''American Historical Review,'' Feb 1991, Vol. 96 Issue 1, pp. 95-124&lt;/ref&gt; The trend was especially pronounced in the U.S. and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Comacchio, "'The History  of Us': Social Science, History, and the Relations of Family in Canada," ''Labour / Le Travail,'' Fall 2000, Vol. 46, pp. 167-220, with very thorough coverage.&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasizes demographic patterns and public policy.  It is quite separate from [[genealogy]], although, it often draws on the same primary sources such as censuses and family records.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://jfh.sagepub.com/ ''Journal of Family History'', quarterly since 1976]&lt;/ref&gt; According to an influential pioneering study in 1978 called: ''Women, Work, and Family''. The authors, [[Louise A. Tilly]] and [[Joan W. Scott]], broke new ground with their broad interpretive framework and emphasis on the variable factors shaping the women's place in the family and economy in France and England. It has considered the interaction of production and reproduction in an analysis of the women's wage labor and thus helped to bring together labor and family history.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Dublin, "Women, Work, and Family: The View from the United States," ''Journal of Women's History,'' Autumn 99, Vol. 11 Issue 3, pp 17-21&lt;/ref&gt;  Much work has been done on the dichotomy in women's lives between the private sphere and the public.&lt;ref&gt;D'Ann Campbell, ''Women at War with America: Private Lives in a Patriotic Era'' (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; For a recent worldwide overview covering 7000 years see Maynes and Waltner (2012).&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jo Maynes and Ann Beth Waltner, ''The Family: A World History'' (Oxford University Press, 2012) [https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=38304 online review]&lt;/ref&gt;
===History of childhood===
The [[history of childhood]] is a growing subfield.&lt;ref&gt;Peter N. Stearns, "Social History and World History: Prospects for Collaboration." ''Journal of World History'' 2007 18(1): 43-52. in  [[Project Muse]], deals with the history of childhood worldwide. See Peter N. Stearns, ''Childhood in World History'' (2005), A.R. Colon with P. A. Colon, ''A History of Children: A Socio-Cultural Survey across Millennia'' (2001), and Steven Mintz, ''[[Huck's Raft: A History of American Childhood]]'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph M. Hawes and N. Ray Hiner, "Hidden in Plain View: The History of Children (and Childhood) in the Twenty-First Century," ''Journal of the History of Childhood &amp; Youth,'' Jan 2008, Vol. 1 Issue 1, pp 43-49&lt;/ref&gt;

Early scholars of family history applied [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s biological [[theory of evolution]] in their theory of the evolution of family systems.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |title=Sociology/Founding the discipline |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=2009-07-26 |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/551887/sociology/222961/Founding-the-discipline#ref=ref748622}}&lt;/ref&gt;  American anthropologist, [[Lewis H. Morgan]], published ''[[Ancient Society]]'' in 1877, based on his theory of the three stages of human progress, from [[Primitive culture|savagery]] through [[barbarian|barbarism]], to [[civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1877&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan's book was the "inspiration for [[Friedrich Engels]]' book", ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State|The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State]]'', published in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Encyclopedia| first = Britannica| title = Cultural Anthropology| accessdate = 2009-07-22| url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/146165/cultural-anthropology/38786/Marxism-and-the-collectors#ref=ref423234
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Engels expanded Morgan's hypothesis that economic factors caused the transformation of primitive community into a class-divided society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = | first =| title = The Marxists Internet Archive| accessdate = 2009-07-17| url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Engels' theory of [[resource]] control and later that of [[Karl Marx]] was used to explain the cause and effect of the change in family structure and function.  The popularity of this theory was largely unmatched until the 1980s, when other sociological theories, particularly [[structural functionalism]], gained acceptance.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt;

The book, ''[[Centuries of Childhood]]'' by [[Philippe Ariès]], published in France in 1960, had a great influence on the revival of the field of family history studies.&lt;ref name="Hareven 1991, p. 95." /&gt;  Ariès used the analysis of [[demographic]] data to draw the conclusion that the concept of childhood was a concept that emerged in modern [[nuclear families]].&lt;ref name="Hareven 1991, p. 95." /&gt;

===Research methodology===
Since the early 20th century, scholars have begun to unify methods of gathering data.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt;  One notable book by W.I. Thomas and Florian Znaniecki, ''Polish Peasant in Europe and America'' (1918), was influential in establishing the precedence of a systematic [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal]] data analysis.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt;  Gathering church files, court records,  letters, architectural and archeological evidence, art and iconography, and food and material culture increased the objectivity and reproducibility of the family reconstruction studies.&lt;ref&gt;Wrigley 1977, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies of current family systems additionally employ qualitative observations, interviews, focus groups, and quantitative surveys.&lt;ref&gt;Daly 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bengston 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family of origin==

In most cultures of the world, the beginning of family history is set in [[creation myth]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg 1986&lt;/ref&gt; In  ''[[Works and Days]]'', the ancient Greek poet [[Hesiod]] describes the epic destruction of four previous [[Ages of Man]].&lt;ref name="Hesiod 1985"&gt;Hesiod 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[utopia]] that was the [[Golden Age]] was eventually replaced by the current [[Iron Age]]; a time when gods made man live in "hopeless misery and toil."&lt;ref name="Hesiod 1985" /&gt; Hesiod's second poem [[Theogony]], described the Greek gods' relationships and family ties.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greeks believed that among them, were descendants of gods who qualified for priesthood or other privileged social status.&lt;ref name="Family Chronicle"&gt;{{cite web|last=Potter-Phillips |first=Donna |title=History of Genealogy |publisher=Family Chronicle |accessdate=2009-07-26 |url=http://www.familychronicle.com/HistoryOfGenealogy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Judeo-Christian tradition originates in the [[Bible]]'s [[Book of Genesis]].  The first man and woman created by God gave rise to all of the humanity.  The Bible reflects the patriarchal worldview and often refers to the practice of [[polygamy]], a common marital practice in ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;Ellens 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In biblical times, men sought to prove their descent from the family of the prophet Moses in order to be accepted into the priesthood.&lt;ref name="Family Chronicle"/&gt;

[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] families would include everyone within a household under the authoritarian role of the father, the [[pater familias]]; this included grown children and the slaves of the household.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = | first = | title = The Illustrated History of the Roman Empire | accessdate = 2009-07-17| url =http://www.roman-empire.net/society/society.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children born outside of marriage, from common and legal [[concubinage]], could not inherit the father's property or name; instead, they belong to the social group and family of their mothers'.&lt;ref name="Letourneau 1904"&gt;Letourneau 1904.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most ancient cultures like those of [[Assyria]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt,]] and [[China]], kept records of successors in the ruling [[dynasties]] to legitimize their power as [[Divinity|divine]] in origin.&lt;ref name="Family Chronicle"/&gt; Both the [[Inca]] king and the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]] claimed that they were direct descendants of the [[Sun God]].&lt;ref name="Family Chronicle"/&gt;  Many cultures, such as the Inca of South America, the [[Kinte]] of Africa, and the [[Māori people|Māori]] of New Zealand, did not have a written language and kept the history of their descent as an oral tradition.&lt;ref name="Family Chronicle"/&gt;

Many cultures used other symbols to document their history of descent.&lt;ref name="Family Chronicle"/&gt;  The [[totem poles]] are indigenous to the people of the [[Pacific Northwest]]. The symbolic representation of the pole goes back to the history of their [[ancestors]] and the family identity, in addition to being tied with the spiritual world.&lt;ref name="Family Chronicle"/&gt;

European [[nobility]] had long and well-documented kinship relationships, sometimes taking their roots in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Family Chronicle"/&gt;  In 1538, King [[Henry VIII of England]] mandated that churches begin the record-keeping practice that soon spread throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="Family Chronicle"/&gt;  Britain's ''[[Domesday Book]]'' from 1086, is one of the oldest European genealogy records. In ancient and medieval times, the history of one's ancestors guaranteed religious and secular prestige.&lt;ref name="Family Chronicle"/&gt;

There were two distinct family patterns that emerged in Christian Europe throughout the Middle Ages.  In most of Southern and Eastern Europe, marriage occurred between two individuals who had lived with their parents for a long period of time.  The man involved was older, usually in his late twenties, and the girl was often still a teenager.  Their household would contain several generations, an occurrence demographers denote as a "complex" household.  In contrast, areas in Northwestern Europe gave rise to a familial structure that was unique for the time period.  The man and woman were typically around the same age, and would wait until they were in their early twenties to marry.  Following the marriage, the couple would set up their own independent household (termed a "nuclear" household structure).  This led to a lower birthrate, as well as greater levels of economic stability for the new couple.  This also served as a check on the increasing population in Europe.  Many women in this region during this time period would never marry at all.&lt;ref&gt;Wiesner, Merry E. “The Family.” ''Gender in History: Global Perspectives'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2011, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1632, [[Virginia]] was the first state in the [[New World]] mandating a civil law that christenings, marriages, and burials were to be recorded.&lt;ref name="Family Chronicle"/&gt; Some modern Americans of European descent belong to organizations for early immigrants to the United States, like the [http://openlibrary.org/a/OL1778316A/National-Society-of-Old-Plymouth-Colony-Descendants National Society of Old Plymouth Colony Descendants], [http://www.themayflowersociety.com The Society of Mayflower Descendants], [http://www.dar.org/ Daughters of the American Revolution], [http://www.sar.org/ National Society Sons of the American Revolution], and [http://www.societyct.org/societies/dffne.php Society of the Descendants of the Founding Fathers of New England].

==Evolution of household==
The organization of the pre-industrial family is now believed to be similar to modern types of family.&lt;ref name="Hareven 1991"&gt;Hareven 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Many sociologists used to believe that the nuclear family was the product of [[industrialization]], but evidence highlighted by historian [[Peter Laslett]] suggests that the causality is reversed and that industrialization was so effective in North-western Europe specifically because the pre-existence of the nuclear family fostered its development.&lt;ref name="Kretzer 2002"&gt;Kretzer 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Family types of pre-industrial Europe belonged into two basic groups, the "simple household system" (the [[nuclear family]]), and the "joint family system" (the [[extended family]]).&lt;ref name="Kretzer 2002" /&gt; A simple household system featured a relatively late age of marriage for both men and women and the establishment of a separate household after the marriage or [[neolocality]].&lt;ref name="Kretzer 2002" /&gt;  A joint family household system was characterized by earlier marriage for women, co-residence with the husband's family or [[patrilocality]], and co-residing of multiple generations. Many households consisted of unrelated [[servant]]s and [[apprentice]]s residing for periods of years, and at that time, belonging to the family.&lt;ref name="Hareven 1991"/&gt; Due to shorter life expectancy and high mortality rates in the pre-industrialized world, much of the structure of a family depended on the average age of the marriage of women. Late marriages, as occurred in the simple household system, left little time for three-generation families to form. Conversely, in the joint family household system, early marriages allowed for multi-generational families to form.&lt;ref name="Kretzer 2002" /&gt;

The pre-industrial family had many functions including food production, [[landholding]], regulation of [[inheritance]], reproduction, socialization and education of its members.  External roles allowed for participation in religion and politics.&lt;ref name="Hareven 1991, p. 96"&gt;Hareven 1991, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;  Social status was also strictly connected to one's family.&lt;ref&gt;Wrigley 1977, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, in the absence of government institutions, the family was the only resource to cope with sickness and aging.&lt;ref name="Hareven 1991, p. 96" /&gt;  Because of the industrial revolution and new work and living conditions, families changed, transferring to public institutions responsibility for food production and the education and welfare of its aging and sick members.&lt;ref name="Hareven 1991, p. 120"&gt;Hareven 1991, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;  Post-industrial families became more private, nuclear, domestic and based on the emotional bonding between husband and wife, and between parents and children.&lt;ref name="Hareven 1991, p. 120" /&gt;

Historian [[Lawrence Stone]] identifies three major types of family structure in England: in about 1450-1630, the [[open lineage family]] dominated. The Renaissance era, 1550-1700, brought the restricted patriarchal nuclear family. The early modern world 1640-1800 emphasized the closed domesticated nuclear family.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Stone, ''The Family, Sex, and Marriage in England 1500-1800'' (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; Stone's conclusions have been disputed by other historians;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanmacfarlane.com/TEXTS/stonesex.pdf Review by of Stone's book by Alan Macfarlane, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Laslett and Alan MacFarlane believe the nuclear family became common in England beginning in the thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-real-roots-of-the-nuclear-family/ The Real Roots of the Nuclear Family]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Labor history''' or '''labour history''' is a sub-discipline of [[social history]] which specialises on the history of the [[working class]]es and the [[labor movement]]. The central concerns of labor historians include [[industrial relations]] and forms of labor protest (strikes, lock-outs), the rise of [[mass politics]] (especially the rise of [[socialism]]) and the social and cultural history of the [[Proletariat|industrial working classes]]. Labor historians may also concern themselves with issues of gender, race, ethnicity and other factors besides class but chiefly focus on urban or industrial societies which distinguishes it from [[rural history]].

==Working-class movement==
Labor history developed in tandem with the growth of a self-conscious working-class political movement in many Western countries in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Whilst early labor historians were drawn to protest movements such as [[Luddism]] and [[Chartism]], the focus of labor history was often on institutions: chiefly the labor unions and political parties. Exponents of this ''institutional'' approach included [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]]. The work of the Webbs, and other pioneers of the discipline, was marked by optimism about the capacity of the labor movement to effect fundamental social change and a tendency to see its development as a process of steady, inevitable and unstoppable progress. As two contemporary labor historians have noted, early work in the field was "designed to service and celebrate the Labour movement."&lt;ref&gt;Mike Savage and Andrew Miles, ''The Remaking of the British Working Class, 1840-1940,'' Routledge, 1994, p. 1. {{ISBN|0-415-07320-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marxist influence==
{{Further|Historiography of the United Kingdom#Marxist historians}}

In the 1950s to 1970s, labor history was redefined and expanded in focus by a number of historians, amongst whom the most prominent and influential figures were [[E. P. Thompson]] and [[Eric Hobsbawm]]. The motivation came from current left-wing politics in Britain and the United States and reached red-hot intensity. [[Kenneth O. Morgan]], a more traditional liberal historian, explains the dynamic:
:the ferocity of argument owed more to current politics, the unions’ [[winter of discontent]] [in 1979], and rise of a hard-left militant tendency within the world of academic history as well as within the [[History of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The new history was often strongly Marxist, which fed through the work of brilliant evangelists like [[Raphael Samuel]] into the [[New Left Review]], a famous journal like [[Past &amp; Present (journal)|Past and Present]], the Society of Labour History and the work of a large number of younger scholars engaged in the field. Non-scholars like [[Tony Benn]] joined in. The new influence of Marxism upon Labour studies came to affect the study of history as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth O. Morgan, ''My Histories'' (University of Wales Press, 2015) p 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan sees benefits: 
:In many ways, this was highly beneficial: it encouraged the study of the dynamics of social history rather than a narrow formal institutional view of labour and the history of the Labour Party; it sought to place the experience of working people within a wider technical and ideological context; it encouraged a more adventurous range of sources, [[People's history|‘history from below’ so-called,]] and rescued them from what Thompson memorably called the ‘condescension of posterity’; it brought the idea of class centre-stage in the treatment of working-class history, where I had always felt it belonged; it shed new light on the poor and dispossessed for whom the source materials were far more scrappy than those for the bourgeoisie, and made original use of popular evidence like oral history, not much used before.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''My Histories'' (2015) p 86.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Morgan tells of the downside as well:
: But the Marxist – or sometimes Trotskyist – emphasis in Labour studies was too often doctrinaire and intolerant of non-Marxist dissent–it was also too often plain wrong, distorting the evidence within a narrow doctrinaire framework. I felt it incumbent upon me to help rescue it. But this was not always fun. I recall addressing a history meeting in Cardiff...when, for the only time in my life, I was subjected to an incoherent series of attacks of a highly personal kind, playing the man not the ball, focusing on my accent, my being at Oxford and the supposedly reactionary tendencies of my empiricist colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''My Histories'' (2015) p 86. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/j.ctt17w8h53.9.pdf?_=1467168515247 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson and Hobsbawm were Marxists who were critical of the existing labour movement in Britain. They were concerned to approach history "from below" and to explore the agency and activity of working people at the workplace, in protest movements and in social and cultural activities. Thompson's seminal study ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]''&lt;ref&gt;E.P. Thompson, ''The Making of the English Working Class,'' Victor Gollancz Ltd., 1963. {{ISBN|0-14-013603-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; was particularly influential in setting a new agenda for labor historians and locating the importance of the study of labor for [[social history]] in general. Also in the 1950s and 1960s, historians began to give serious attention to groups who had previously been largely neglected, such as women and non-caucasian ethnic groups. Some historians situated their studies of gender and race within a class analysis: for example, [[C. L. R. James]], a [[Marxism|Marxist]] who wrote about the struggles of blacks in the [[Haitian Revolution]]. Others questioned whether class was a more important social category than gender or race and pointed to racism, patriarchy and other examples of division and oppression ''within'' the working class.

Labor history remains centered on two fundamental sets of interest: institutional histories of workers' organizations, and the "history from below" approach of the Marxist historians.

Despite the influence of the Marxists, many labor historians rejected the revolutionary implications implicit in the work of Thompson, Hobsbawm et al. In the 1980s, the importance of [[social class|class]] itself, as an historical social relationship and explanatory concept, began to be widely challenged. Some notable labor historians turned from Marxism to embrace a [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] approach, emphasizing the importance of language and questioning whether classes could be so considered if they did not use a "language of class". Other historians emphasized the weaknesses and moderation of the historic labor movement, arguing that social development had been characterized more by accommodation, acceptance of the social order and cross-class collaboration than by conflict and dramatic change.

==United States==
{{Main article|Labor history of the United States}}
Labor history in the United States is primarily based in history departments, with occasional representation inside labor unions. The scholarship  deals with the institutional history of labor unions and the social history of workers. In recent years there's been special attention to historically marginal groups, especially blacks, women, Hispanics and Asians.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Walkowitz and Donna T. Haverty-Stacke, eds. ''Rethinking U.S. Labor History: Essays on the Working-Class Experience, 1756-2009'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
The Study Group on International Labor and Working-Class History was established: 1971 and has a membership of 1000.  It publishes ''International Labor and Working-Class History''.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.newschool.edu/gf/history/ilwch/ Study Group on International Labor and Working-Class History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518111017/http://www.newschool.edu/gf/history/ilwch/ |date=2015-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; H-LABOR is a daily email-based discussion group formed in 1993 that reaches over a thousand scholars and advanced students.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.h-net.org/~labor/ H-LABOR website]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Labor and Working-Class History Association]] formed in 1988 and publishes ''[[Labor: Studies in Working-Class History of the Americas]]''.

==Historiography==
Kirk (2010) surveys labor historiography in Britain since the formation of the Society for the Study of Labour History in 1960. He reports that labor history has been mostly pragmatic, eclectic and empirical; it has played an important role in historiographical debates, such as those revolving around history from below, institutionalism versus the social history of labor, class, populism, gender, language, postmodernism and the turn to politics. Kirk rejects suggestions that the field is declining, and stresses its innovation, modification and renewal. Kirk also detects a move into conservative insularity and academicism. He recommends a more extensive and critical engagement with the kinds of comparative, transnational and global concerns increasingly popular among labor historians elsewhere, and calls for a revival of public and political interest in the topics.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Kirk, "Challenge, Crisis, and Renewal? Themes in the Labour History of Britain, 1960–2010," ''Labour History Review,'' Aug 2010, Vol. 75 Issue 2, pp 162-180&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Navickas, (2011) examines recent scholarship including the histories of collective action, environment and human ecology, and gender issues, with a focus on work by James Epstein, Malcolm Chase, and Peter Jones.&lt;ref&gt;Katrina Navickas, "What happened to class? New histories of labour and collective action in Britain," ''Social History,'' May 2011, Vol. 36 Issue 2, pp 192-204&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the Marxist orbit, social historians paid a good deal of attention to labour history as well.&lt;ref&gt;John McIlroy, "Asa Briggs and the Emergence of Labour History in Post-War Britain." ''Labour History Review'' 77.2 (2012): 211-242.&lt;/ref&gt;

Addison notes that in Britain by the 1990s, labour history was, "in sharp decline," because:
:there was no longer much interest in history of the white, male working-class.  Instead the 'cultural turn' encouraged historians to explore wartime constructions of gender, race, citizenship and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Addison and Harriet Jones, eds. '' A Companion to Contemporary Britain: 1939-2000'' (2005) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonora Beck Ellis''' (née, '''Leonora Beck'''; 1862-1951) was a 19th-century American educator, author, poet, and Southern social reformer,{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=49}} from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. She served as president of the Woman’s Press Association of Georgia,{{sfn|Southern Historical Association|1895|p=690}} and for five years, was president of the Capital Female College of [[Atlanta]].{{sfn|American Publishers' Association|1915|p=95}}

==Early years and education==
Leonora Beck was born near [[Augusta, Georgia]], in 1862. Her father, Rev. James W. Beck (born [[Wilkes County, Georgia]], October 23, 1831), was among the first teachers at Jackson Institute. Her mother was Margaret Willis, of [[Meriwether County, Georgia]]. There were two brothers: Marcus W., judge of the Flint circuit court; and Walter L., business manager of the Griffin Wheel company, of Chicago.{{sfn|Southern Historical Association|1895|p=690}}

At an early age, she showed an unusual aptitude for linguistic study, speaking several modern languages when nine years old. She was well grounded in Latin and Greek when 15 years old. Ellis was educated at Oxford College, in [[Alabama]], the only college for men in the South which received women. There, she studied and trained for the teaching profession, graduating at the age of 16 years with A.M. distinction.{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=69}}

==Career== 
===Educator===
At once, Ellis accepted the position of young lady principal in the college at [[Bowdon, Georgia]], which she held for two and a half years. During her connection with that institution, Ellis instructed in [[metaphysics]], Latin and Greek about 100 students, ranging from the ages of 15 to 30 years. Her success as an educator becoming more generally known, she was urged to accept many positions of trust and honor, but declined them. Next, she taught at the Jackson Institute in [[Jackson, Georgia]]. In 1889, Ellis removed to [[Atlanta]] to engage in founding the Capital Female College, later known as the Leonora Beck College.{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=69}} 

===Writer and social reformer===
After her marriage to Richard Abbey Ellis, editor of the Atlanta ''Illustrator'',{{sfn|Bohemian Publishing Company|1896|p=60}} on June 2, 1896, she devoted herself to literature. Ellis' earliest articles appeared in ''Munsey's'', ''Leslie's'', the ''Bachelor of Arts'', and the ''New England Magazine'', in 1896 and 1897. Afterwards, she contributed stories, essays, travel sketches, and occasional verse to many different periodicals, but her chief writing was upon economic and sociological themes, and her thoughtful papers upon such subjects appeared from time to time in the ''Forum'', the ''Arena'', the ''Independent'', the ''Review of Reviews'', among others. Especially, she devoted herself to the varying phases of the great industrial revolution in the South, and her papers treating of social, educational, and material conditions in the manufacturing population of that section were accepted as high authority.{{sfn|Hills|Luce|1901|p=73}} Besides a volume of stories entitled 'Star Heights', and an occasional poem, a series of essays on [[Robert Browning]] was, perhaps, her most enduring contribution to literature.{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=69}}

Ellis was the author of a number of articles bearing upon economic and sociological conditions in the [[Southern United States|South]]. The [[Library of Congress]] listed her series of articles on child labor, because of the interest which they possess for students of this problem. Ellis spent much of her time in [[Aripeka, Florida]]. She was engaged in making investigations among the sponge fishers of the Florida coast.{{sfn|Alderman|Harris|Kent|1910|p=137}}

'''''Marshall v Southampton and South West Hampshire Area Health Authority ''''' (1986) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61984CJ0152 Case 152/84] is an [[EU law]] case, concerning the conflict of law between a national legal system and European Union law.

==Facts==
Helen Marshall, a senior dietitian, claimed that her dismissal on grounds of being old violated the [[Equal Treatment Directive 1976]]. She was an employee of an Area Health Authority (or "AHA"), a body established by the UK government under the [[National Health Service Act 1977]], as amended by the [[Health Services Act 1980]].

Marshall was dismissed after 14 years on 31 March 1980, approximately four weeks after attaining the age of 62, despite her expressing a willingness to continue in employment until the age of 65 (4 February 1983). The sole reason for her dismissal was that she had passed 'the retirement age'; the AHA’s policy was to make women compulsorily retire at 60, but men at 65.

Section 27 (1) and 28 (1) of the Social Security Act 1975 provided state pensions were to be granted to men at 65 and woman at 60, though notably did not impose any obligation to retire at the age at which the state pension becomes payable. 

The AHA were able to waive the term, which was deemed an implied term of Marshall's contract of employment and had done so for a further two years after she attained the age of 60. 

Given Marshall suffered financial loss, namely the difference between her earnings as an employee and her pension, and since she lost the satisfaction gained from work she initiated proceedings before an industrial tribunal, contending her dismissal constituted discriminatory treatment on the ground of sex, contrary to the sexual discrimination act and community law. The tribunal dismissed the claim in so far as it was based on infringement of the sexual discrimination act, since s 6 (4) permits discrimination of the grounds of sex in regards to retirement. However the claim on the basis that the principle of equal treatment laid down by directive 76/207 was upheld. 

The employment appeal tribunal affirmed the industrial tribunal on the first point, yet set aside the decision on the second point, on the basis that an individual had no ''[[locus standi]]'' and could not rely upon such a violation in proceedings before a United Kingdom court or tribunal. 

The English Court of Appeal found the Area Health Authority an ‘emanation of the State’, observing that the AHA respondent was constituted under s.8(1) of the [[National Health Service Act 1977]]. The Court made reference of two questions for [[preliminary ruling]] to the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ): 
*First, whether the respondent's dismissal on the grounds that she was a woman who had passed the normal retiring age was an act of discrimination prohibited by the Directive. 
*Secondly, if the answer to the first is affirmative, whether or not the equal treatment directive can be relied upon by the appellant in the circumstances in national courts or tribunals, not withstanding the inconsistency, if any, between the Directive and the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]].

==Judgment==

===Advocate General Opinion===
[[Advocate General#Other European jurisdictions|Advocate General]] [[Lord Slynn|Slynn]] argued the ‘state’ should be construed broadly, to cover all organs, saying that insinuating ‘[[Direct effect of European Union law#Varieties of direct effect|horizontal effect]]’&lt;ref&gt;Horizontal direct effect concerns the relationship between individuals (including companies). If a certain provision of EU law is horizontally directly effective, then citizens are able to rely on it in actions against each other. Directives are usually incapable of being horizontally directly effective. Certain provisions of the treaties and legislative acts such as regulations are capable of being directly enforced horizontally.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vertical direct effect concerns the relationship between EU law and national law – specifically, the state's obligation to ensure its observance and its compatibility with EU law, thereby enabling citizens to rely on it in actions against the state or against public bodies; an "emanation of the state" as defined in [[Foster v. British Gas plc]].&lt;/ref&gt; into directives would ‘totally blur the distinction between EU directives and regulations'.

===Court of Justice===
The [[ECJ]], in a full court of 13 judges, held there was no horizontal direct effect. It does not matter what capacity a state is acting. Thus it fell to enquire whether the NHS should be deemed an "independent legal person" or an "arm of the state"; and that was a matter for the national court.

{{Cquote|48. ... according to article 189 of the EEC Treaty the binding nature of a directive, which constitutes the basis for the possibility of relying on the directive before a national court, exists only in relation to 'each member state to which it is addressed'. It follows that a directive may not of itself impose obligations on an individual and that a provision of a directive may not be relied on as such against such a person.
 
49. ... In either case it is necessary to prevent the State from taking advantage of its own failure to comply with Union law.}}

===English Court of Appeal===
This case involved an application for a preliminary ruling. Once the ECJ had answered the question, their decision was remitted to the reconvened Court of Appeal (which in the interim had adjourned this case). The Court of Appeal was then obliged to reach a decision in the light of the ECJ ruling.

'''Maurice Maignen''', (1822–1890),  was a [[France|French]] [[Social movement|Social Reformer]] and a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Brother (Catholic)|Religious Brother]] during the nineteenth century. He was the founder of the Catholic Circle of Montparnasse to prevent future tragedies from happening, like the [[Paris Commune]].

==Biography==
Maurice Maignen (Jules-Charles-Maurice Maignen) was born in [[Paris]], on March 3, 1822, to Charles-Desire-Adelaide Maignen and Cecile-Josephine (née Chamigner), before the [[French Revolution of 1848|Revolution]].  He was baptized at [[Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois]] three days later.&lt;ref&gt;http://uiddkon.archive.org/stream/mauricemaignenle00maro#page/n9/mode/2up Maurice Maignene: The Social Apostolate (1895)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1818, his father, an artist, graduated from [[École des Beaux-Arts|Académie des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]], before joining the Military House of the King, as a bodyguard. His father returned to painting only after two years of service.

Maurice was schooled for only six years. At fifteen, he started working, to provide for his family because of his father's illness. He started working on the newly formed railroad, Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris à Saint-Germain, the predecessor to [[Chemins de Fer de l'Ouest|Compagnie des chemins de fer de l'Ouest]], where he remained until 1843, before becoming a draftsman at the [[Minister of Defence (France)|Ministry of War]]. He found, with Jean-Léon Le Prevost and Clement Myionnet, the [[Congregation of the Mission|Congregation of the Brothers of St. Vincent de Paul]] with the [[Apostolates|apostolate]] of education of the youth and evangelisation of the poor and workers.

In 1855, at the age of 33, Brother Maurice created an "Association of Young Workers" and, in 1865, it evolved into the "Circle of Young Workers", better known as "Catholic Circle of Montparnasse".&lt;ref&gt;http://tuisp.online.fr/2004/2004_dumont.pdf Maurice Maignen et la contre-révolution, pensée et action d'un catholique social 1871–1890, Submission by Michèle Cointet, UFR Arts and Humanities Department of History University of Tours in 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter of 1871, he met two officers, former prisoners of war, [[Albert de Mun]] and [[François-René de La Tour du Pin, Chambly de La Charce|René de la Tour du Pin]], who remained lifelong friends with him.  Both Albert and René found the [[Society of Catholic Worker Circles]], through the inspiration of Brother Maurice.

Maurice Maignen died on December 7, 1890. He body was interred in the Chapel at the Montparnasse Circle and his heart was encased in a reliquary in the Motherhouse of his "Congregation of the Brothers of St. Vincent de Paul."

==History==

The first Mundo Lingo event was an initiative of UK born Benji Moreira when he was an immigrant in [[Buenos Aires]] ([[Argentina]]). It took place on July 7, 2011 and was aimed for local Argentines to learn foreign languages and for internationals to practice Spanish.
After a while, around 50 people per week were attending and the flag system was introduced. In 2014 the event grew increasingly popular and was exported to Cologne, London, Montreal, and then Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mundolingo.org/history |title= History of Mundo Lingo|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 2016|website= mundolingo.org  |access-date= 5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(1998). Technophobia: the psychological impact of Information Technology. pg 155. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The name is based on the historical legacy of the English [[Luddite]]s, who were active between 1811 and 1816.&lt;ref name="jonesagainstechnology"/&gt;

Neo-Luddism is a leaderless movement of non-affiliated groups who resist modern technologies and dictate a return of some or all technologies to a more primitive level.&lt;ref name = Sale&gt;Sale, Kirkpatrick, America’s new Luddites. URL=http://mondediplo.com/1997/02/20luddites&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Luddites are characterized by one or more of the following practices: passively abandoning the use of technology, harming those who produce technology, advocating [[simple living]], or [[monkeywrenching|sabotaging]] technology. The modern neo-Luddite movement has connections with the [[anti-globalization movement]], [[antiscience|anti-science movement]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[radical environmentalism]], and [[deep ecology]].&lt;ref name = Sale /&gt;

Neo-Luddism is based on the concern of the technological impact on individuals, their communities, and/or the environment,&lt;ref name=christensenencyclopedia&gt;{{cite book  | last = Christensen  | first = Karen  |author2=David Levinson  | title = Encyclopedia of community: from the village to the virtual world, Volume 3  | publisher = SAGE  | year = 2003  | location =   | pages = 886  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=t1geOjQ6R0MC&amp;dq=Neo-Luddism| isbn = 978-0-7619-2598-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Luddism stipulates the use of the [[precautionary principle]] for all new technologies, insisting that technologies be proven safe before adoption, due to the unknown effects that new technologies might inspire.

==Philosophy==
Neo-Luddism  calls for slowing or stopping the development of new technologies. Neo-Luddism prescribes a lifestyle that abandons specific technologies, because of its belief that this is the best prospect for the future. As Robin and Webster put it, "a return to nature and what are imagined as more natural communities." In the place of industrial capitalism, neo-Luddism prescribes small-scale agricultural communities such as those of the Amish and the [[Chipko movement]] in Nepal and India&lt;ref name="Basney" /&gt; as models for the future.

Neo-Luddism denies the ability of any new technology to solve current problems, such as [[environmental degradation]],&lt;ref name="Basney" /&gt; [[nuclear warfare]] and [[biological weapons]], without creating more, potentially dangerous problems.&lt;ref name=grahaminternet&gt;{{cite book  | last = Graham  | first = Gordon  | title = The Internet: a philosophical inquiry  | publisher = Routledge  | year = 1999  | location =   | page = 9  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NDr8Fh4rNQAC&amp;dq=Neo-Luddism| isbn = 978-0-415-19749-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Luddites are generally opposed to [[anthropocentrism]], [[globalization]] and [[industrial capitalism]].

In 1990, attempting to reclaim the term 'Luddite' and found a unified movement, [[Chellis Glendinning]] published her "Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto". In this paper, Glendinning describes neo-Luddites as "20th century citizens—activists, workers, neighbors, social critics, and scholars—who question the predominant modern worldview, which preaches that unbridled technology represents [[Idea of Progress|progress]]."&lt;ref name="GlendinningChellis"&gt;[[Chellis Glendinning|Glendinning, Chellis]]. ''[https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/chellis-glendinning-notes-toward-a-neo-luddite-manifesto Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto]''. Utne Reader, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Glendinning voices an opposition to technologies that she deems destructive to communities or are materialistic and rationalistic. She proposes that technology encourages biases, and therefore should question if technologies have been created for specific interests, to perpetuate their specific values including short-term efficiency, ease of production and marketing, as well as profit. Glendinning also says that secondary aspects of technology, including social, economic and ecological implications, and not personal benefit need to be considered before adoption of technology into the technological system.&lt;ref name="GlendinningChellis" /&gt;

===Vision of the future without intervention===
Neo-Luddism often establishes stark predictions about the effect of new technologies. 
Although there is not a cohesive vision of the ramifications of technology, neo-Luddism predicts that a future without technological reform has dire consequences. Neo-Luddites believe that current technologies are a threat to humanity and to the natural world in general, and that a future [[societal collapse]] is possible or even probable. 

Neo-Luddite [[Ted Kaczynski]] predicted a world with a depleted environment, an increase in [[Causes of schizophrenia#Urbanicity|psychological disorders]], with either "leftists" who aim to control humanity through technology, or technology directly controlling humanity.&lt;ref name="Kaczynski" /&gt; According to Sale, "The industrial civilization so well served by its potent technologies cannot last, and will not last; its collapse is certain within not more than a few decades.".&lt;ref name="jour" /&gt; [[Stephen Hawking]], a famous astrophysicist, predicted that the means of production will be controlled by the "machine owner" class and that without redistribution of wealth technology will create more economic inequality.&lt;ref name=HuffPo&gt;Stephen Hawking Says We Should Really, 2016 | http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-hawking-capitalism-robots_us_5616c20ce4b0dbb8000d9f15&lt;/ref&gt;

These predictions include changes in humanity's place in the future due to replacement of humans by computers, genetic decay of humans due to lack of natural selection, biological engineering of humans, misuse of technological power including disasters caused by [[genetically modified organism]]s, [[nuclear warfare]], and [[biological weapons]]; control of humanity using surveillance, propaganda, pharmacological control, and psychological control; humanity failing to adapt to the future manifesting as an increase in psychological disorders, widening economic and political [[Economic inequality|inequality]], widespread [[social alienation]], a loss of community, and massive [[unemployment]]; technology causing [[environmental degradation]] due to shortsightedness, overpopulation, and overcrowding.&lt;ref name="Basney" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theodore J. Kaczynski, David Skrbina; ''Technological Slavery, The Collected Writings of Theodore J. Kaczynski, a.k.a. "The Unabomber."''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of intervention===
In 1990, attempting to reclaim the term 'Luddite' and found a unified movement, [[Chellis Glendinning]] published her "Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto". In this paper, Glendinning proposes destroying the following technologies: electromagnetic technologies (this includes communications, computers, appliances, and refrigeration), chemical technologies (this includes synthetic materials and medicine), [[Nuclear technology|nuclear technologies]] (this includes weapons and power as well as cancer treatment, sterilization, and smoke detection), [[genetic engineering]] (this includes crops as well as insulin production).&lt;ref name="GlendinningChellis" /&gt; She argues in favor of the "search for new technological forms" which are local in scale and promote social and political freedom.

[[File:Young theodore kaczynski.jpeg|thumb|Kaczynski as a young professor at [[University of California, Berkeley|U.C. Berkeley]], 1968|alt=A man in a suit faces the camera while he stands in front of a building.]]
In "The coming revolution", Kaczynski outlined what he saw as changes humanity will have to make in order to make society functional, "new values that will free them from the yoke of the present technoindustrial system", including:
* Rejection of all modern technology  –  "This is logically necessary, because modern technology is a whole in which all parts are interconnected; you can’t get rid of the bad parts without also giving up those parts that seem good."
* Rejection of civilization itself
* Rejection of [[Economic materialism|materialism]] and its replacement with a conception of life that values moderation and self-sufficiency while deprecating the acquisition of property or of status.
* Love and reverence toward nature or even worship of nature
* Exaltation of freedom
* Punishment of those responsible for the present situation. "Scientists, engineers, corporation executives, politicians, and so forth to make the cost of improving technology too great for anyone to try"

==Movement==
Contemporary neo-Luddites are a widely diverse group of loosely affiliated or non-affiliated groups which includes "writers, academics, students, families, [[Amish]], [[Mennonites]], [[Quakers]], [[environmentalists]], "fallen-away [[yuppies]]," "ageing [[flower children]]" and "young idealists seeking a technology-free environment."&lt;ref name="jour"&gt;Doresa Banning, Modern Day Luddites, November 30, 2001, URL=http://www.jour.unr.edu/j705/RP.BANNING.LUDDITE.HTML&lt;/ref&gt; Some Luddites see themselves as victims of technology trying to prevent further victimization (such as Citizens Against Pesticide Misuse and Parents Against Underage Smartphones). Others see themselves as advocates for the natural order and resist environmental degradation by technology (such as [[Earth First!]]).&lt;ref name="jour" /&gt;

One neo-Luddite assembly was the "Second Neo-Luddite Congress", held April 13–15, 1996, at a Quaker meeting hall in [[Barnesville, Ohio]]. On February 24, 2001, the "Teach-In on Technology and Globalization" was held at [[Hunter College]] in New York city with the purpose to bring together critics of technology and globalization.&lt;ref name="jour" /&gt; The two figures who are seen as the movement's founders are [[Chellis Glendinning]] and [[Kirkpatrick Sale]]. Prominent neo-Luddites include educator S. D. George, ecologist Stephanie Mills, [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]], [[Scott Savage]], [[Clifford Stoll]], [[Bill McKibben]], [[Neil Postman]], [[Wendell Berry]], [[Alan Marshall (New Zealand author)|Alan Marshall]] and [[Gene Logsdon]].&lt;ref name="Basney" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jour" /&gt; Postman, however, did not consider himself a Luddite and loathed being associated with the term.{{citation_needed|date=July 2017}}

===Relationship to violence and vandalism===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Theodore Kaczynski at Unabomber trial.jpg|thumb|left|Theodore Kaczynski at Unabomber trial]] --&gt;
Some neo-Luddites use vandalism and or violence to achieve social change and promote their cause.&lt;ref name=bellmcgraw&gt;{{cite book  | last = Bell  | first = David  | title = Science, technology and culture  | publisher = McGraw-Hill International   | year = 2005  | location =   | page = 55  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pEcqiii4MOUC&amp;dq=Neo-Luddism| isbn = 978-0-335-21326-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, credit for the shooting of Roberto Adinolfi, an [[Ansaldo Nucleare]] executive, was claimed by an [[anarchist]] group who targeted him for stating that none of the deaths following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] were caused by the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] itself: &lt;blockquote&gt;Adinolfi knows well that it is only a matter of time before a European Fukushima kills on our continent [...] Science in centuries past promised us a golden age, but it is pushing us towards self destruction and slavery [...] With our action we give back to you a small part of the suffering that you scientists are bringing to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Italian anarchists kneecap nuclear executive and threaten more shootings |author=Tom Kington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/11/italian-anarchists-kneecap-nuclear-executive |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=11 May 2012 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kaczynski, also known as the ''Unabomber'', initially sabotaged developments near his cabin but dedicated himself to getting back at the system after discovering a road had been built over a plateau he had considered beautiful. Between 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski engaged in a nationwide bombing campaign against modern technology, planting or mailing numerous home-made bombs, killing three people and injuring 23 others. In his 1995 manifesto, ''Industrial Society and Its Future'',&lt;ref name="Kaczynski" /&gt; Kaczynski states: &lt;blockquote&gt;The kind of revolution we have in mind will not necessarily involve an armed uprising against any government. It may or may not involve physical violence, but it will not be a POLITICAL revolution. Its focus will be on technology and economics, not politics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In August 2011 in [[Mexico]] a group or person calling itself [[Individuals Tending Towards the Wild]] perpetrated an attack with a bomb at the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, State of Mexico Campus]], intended for the coordinator of its Business Development Center and Technology Transfer. The attack was accompanied by the publication of a [[manifesto]] criticizing [[nanotechnology]] and [[computer science]].

Sale says that neo-Luddites are not motivated to commit violence or vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with the Luddite, Wired magazine, Issue 3.06, Jun 1995. URL=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/saleskelly.html&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto of the 'Second Luddite Congress', which Sale took a major part in defining, attempts to redefine neo-Luddites as people who reject violent action.&lt;ref name="jour" /&gt;

==History==
===Origins of contemporary critiques of technology in literature===
According to Julian Young, [[Martin Heidegger]] was a Luddite in his early philosophical phase and believed in the destruction of modern technology and a return to an earlier agrarian world.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Julian. ''Heidegger's Later Philosophy'', p. 80. Cambridge University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Martin Heidegger#Later works: The Turn|later Heidegger]] did not see technology as wholly negative and did not call for its abandonment or destruction.&lt;ref name=Wheeler /&gt; In ''The Question Concerning Technology'' (1953), Heidegger posited that the modern technological "mode of Being" was one which viewed the natural world, plants, animals, and even human beings as a "standing-reserve"—resources to be exploited as means to an end.&lt;ref name=Wheeler&gt;Wheeler, Michael, "Martin Heidegger", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2013 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/heidegger/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate this "monstrousness", Heidegger uses the example of a [[hydroelectric plant]] on the [[Rhine river]] which turns the river from an unspoiled natural wonder to just a supplier of [[hydropower]]. In this sense, technology is not just the collection of tools, but a way of being in the world and of understanding the world which is instrumental and grotesque. According to Heidegger, this way of being defines the modern way of living in the West.&lt;ref name=Wheeler /&gt; For Heidegger, this technological process ends up reducing beings to not-beings, which Heidegger calls 'the abandonment of being' and involves the loss of any sense of awe and wonder, as well as an indifference to that loss.&lt;ref name=Wheeler /&gt;

One of the first major contemporary anti-technological thinkers was French philosopher [[Jacques Ellul]]. In his ''The Technological Society'' (1964), Ellul argued that the rationality of technology enforces logical and mechanical organization which "eliminates or subordinates the natural world." Ellul defined ''technique'' as the entire totality of organizational methods and technology with a goal toward maximum rational efficiency. According to Ellul, technique has an impetus which tends to drown out human concerns: "The only thing that matters technically is yield, production. This is the law of ''technique''; this yield can only be obtained by the total mobilization of human beings, body and soul, and this implies the exploitation of all human psychic forces."&lt;ref&gt;Ellul, ''The Technological Society'' p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic of political and technological expansion was [[Lewis Mumford]], who wrote ''[[The Myth of the Machine]]''. The views of Ellul influenced the ideas of the infamous American neo-Luddite Kaczynski. The opening of Kaczynski's manifesto reads: "The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race."&lt;ref name=Kaczynski&gt;[[The Washington Post]]: Unabomber Special Report: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm Industrial Society and Its Future by Theodore Kaczynski]&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[philosophy of technology|philosophers of technology]] who have questioned the validity of technological progress include [[Albert Borgmann]], [[Don Ihde]] and [[Hubert Dreyfus]].&lt;ref name=Basney&gt;Basney, Lionel. Questioning Progress, Books and Culture magazine, 1998. URL=http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/1998/sepoct/8b5018.html?paging=off&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See: Dreyfus, H.

W. (1998). [http://mcq.sagepub.com/content/12/2/183.short Development and Validation of the Organizational Dissent Scale]&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[dissent]] involves [[disagreement]] it can lead to [[Organizational conflict|conflict]], which if not resolved, can lead to [[violence]] and struggle. As a result, many organizations send the message – [[Linguistics|verbally]] or [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbally]] – that [[dissent]] is discouraged. However, recent studies have shown that [[dissent]] serves as an important monitoring force within [[organizations]]. Dissent can be a [[warning sign]] for employee dissatisfaction or organizational decline. Redding (1985) found that receptiveness to dissent allows for corrective [[feedback]] to monitor [[unethical]] and [[immoral]] [[behavior]], impractical and ineffectual organizational practices and policies, poor and unfavorable [[decision making]], and insensitivity to employees' [[wikt:workplace|workplace]] needs and desires. Furthermore, Eilerman&lt;ref name="Eilerman 2006"&gt;Eilerman, D. (January 2006).

Perlow (2003) found that employee [[resentment]] can lead to a decrease in [[productivity]] and [[creativity]] which can result in the organization losing [[money]], [[time]], and [[Resource (economics)|resources]].

==Types of dissent==
There are three types of dissent: articulated, latent, and displaced (Kassing, 1998).

===Articulated===
Involves expressing dissent openly and clearly in a constructive fashion to members of an organization that can effectively influence organization adjustment. This may include [[supervisor]]s, [[management]], and [[corporate officer]]s.

===Latent===
Employees resort to expressing dissent to either their coworkers or other ineffectual [[audience]]s within the organization. Employees employ this route when they desire to [[voice]] their [[opinions]] but lack sufficient avenues to effectively express themselves.

===Displaced===
Involves expressing dissent to external audiences, such as [[family]] and [[friend]]s, rather than [[News media|media]] or [[political]] sources sought out by whistle-blowers.

==Factors influencing dissent expression==
Kassing (1997) states there are three factors that influence which dissent [[strategy]] an [[employee]] will decide to use:
# [[Individual]]
# [[Interpersonal relationship|Relational]]
# [[Organization]]al

===Individual influences===
Individual influences concern qualities that employees bring to the organization, expectations they have acquired, and [[behaviors]] they enact within organizations.

===Preference to avoid conflict===
Roberto (2005) claims that employees may have a preference for avoiding [[Organizational conflict|conflict]]. Therefore, they find confrontation in a public setting uncomfortable. Individual's sense of powerlessness and senses of right and wrong are contributing factors (Kassing &amp; Avtgis, 1999).

===Verbal aggressiveness and argumentativeness===
Kassing and Avtgis (1999) demonstrated that an individual's verbal [[aggressiveness]] and [[argumentative]]ness influence the manner in which an individual will approach expressing dissent. Verbal aggressiveness involves attacking another person's [[self concept]]. This may include character attacks, [[Skill|competence]] attacks, [[ridicule]], and [[threats]]. Argumentativeness, on the other hand, is when an individual argues about [[controversial]] issues.

Individuals will choose their [[strategy]] for expressing dissent based on the strength of their [[arguments]]. Kassing and Avtgis (1999) found an individual who is more argumentative and less verbally aggressive is prone to use articulated dissent. On the other hand, an individual who lacks argumentative skills will resort to using a less direct and more aggressive strategy, latent dissent.

===Work locus of control===
Work [[locus of control]] can also be a contributing influence. An individual with an internal locus of control orientation believes that they have control over their [[destiny]]. They feel the only way to bring about a desired outcome is to act. Individuals who see their lives as being controlled by outside forces demonstrate an external locus of control (Robbins, 2005). Kassing's (2001) study demonstrated that employees with an internal locus of control used articulated dissent whereas an employee with an external locus of control preferred to use latent dissent.

===Relational influences===
Relational influences include the types and qualities of relationships people maintain within their organization.

''Employee relationships''&lt;br&gt;
[[Employees]] develop and maintain various relationships within organizations. These relationships can influence the choices employees make about expressing dissent. Employees may feel uncomfortable voicing their dissenting [[opinions]] in the presence of others because they feel the best way to preserve relationships is to keep quiet. Homogeneous groups also place pressure on individuals to [[conform]]. Since many people fear being [[embarrassed]] in front of their [[peer group|peers]], they can easily be lulled into [[consensus]] (Roberto, 2005).

''Superior–subordinate relationship''&lt;br&gt;
The [[Superior (hierarchy)|superior]]–[[subordinate]] relationship is an important relational factor. Employees who perceive they have a higher-quality relationship with their [[supervisor]]s are more often to use articulated dissent. They feel their supervisors respect their opinions and that they have mutual influence and [[persuasion]] over the outcome of organizational decisions. Conversely, employees that perceive their relationship with their supervisor as low-quality will resort to latent dissent. They feel that there is no room to voice their opinions (Kassing, 2000).

[[Management]] which models the use of articulated dissent contributes to the use of articulated dissent among its employees (Kassing &amp; Avtgis, 1999). Subordinates who witness their supervisors successfully articulating dissent may be more likely and more willing to adopt similar [[strategies]]. However, a supervisor must keep in mind that expressing dissent can be very difficult and uncomfortable for lower-level managers and employees. Therefore, supervisors should not only take actions to encourage dissent, they must be willing to seek out individuals willing to say no to them (Roberto, 2005).

===Organizational influences===
Organizational influences concern how organizations relate to their employees.

====Organizational norms====
Once an employee joins an organization, it is through [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] that they learn the [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] of the organization. Perlow (2003) states that organizations placing "high value on being [[Politeness|polite]] and avoiding confrontation" can cause employees to be uncomfortable expressing their differences. Employees make assessments about [[Motivation|motives]] and [[restraints]] when others dissent and use this [[knowledge]] to inform their own decisions about when and how to use dissent (Kassing, 2001). Furthermore, some corporate assumptions are accepted without questioning. For example, employees will defer to the expert's opinion (Roberto, 2005).

====Organizational identification====
Organizational identification and workplace [[freedom of speech]] has an effect on an individual's choice of expressing dissent (Kassing, 2000). If an individual highly identifies himself or herself with the organization, they are more likely to use the dissent strategy that mirrors the organization's [[values]]. If the organization demonstrates it values dissent and promotes workplace freedom of speech, the highly identified employee will demonstrate articulate dissent.

====Openness====
An organization that limits the opportunities for employees to voice their opinions, demonstrates contradictory expectations, and gives the perception that [[openness]] is not favored, will lead employees to select latent dissent strategies (Kassing &amp; Avtgis, 1999).

==Perceptions of organizational dissenters==
The [[perceptions]] of supervisors and coworkers can be used to further determine an individual's choice of dissent strategy. Employees will take notice of other [[dissenter]]s and the consequences of their actions and will use this information to refine their "sense of organizational tolerance for dissent, to determine what issues merit dissent, and to inform their future dissent strategy choices" (Kassing, 2001).

Kassing (2001) found that articulated and latent dissenters were perceived differently. People perceived articulated dissenters to be more satisfied, more committed, possess higher quality relationships with their supervisors, and seen as employees who believed they have influence within their organizations than latent dissenters. Furthermore, articulated dissenters, compared to latent dissenters, were perceived to be less verbally [[aggressive]].

==Triggering events==
Organizational dissent begins with a triggering event. This triggering event is what propels individuals to speak out and share their [[opinions]] about organizational practices or [[politics]]. An individual will consider the issue of dissent and whom it concerns before deciding what dissent strategy to use. The types of issues that cause employees to dissent vary. The majority of [[employees]] expressed dissent due to resistance of organizational change. Other factors include employee treatment, [[decision making]] [[Tactic (method)|tactics]], [[inefficiency]], [[role]]/[[Moral responsibility|responsibility]], [[Resource (economics)|resources]], [[ethics]], [[performance management|performance]] [[evaluation]]s, and preventing harm (Kassing, 2002).

In addition to the dissent-triggering event, the focus of the issues can be relevant to how one expresses dissent. Kassing (2002) believed individuals may focus on improving matters within the organization that affect themselves (self-focused), they may focus on the welfare of the organization of the whole (other-focused) or they may focus on issues concerning their co-workers (neutral).

===Articulated dissent===
An individual will use upward articulate dissent in response to functional and other-focused dissent-triggering events. [[Organizations]] are more attractive to upward articulate dissenting when it is in regards to functional aspects. This type of dissent gives the perception that dissenters are being constructive and are concerned with issues of "principle rather than personal-advantage." It allows the employee to signal their commitment to [[cooperative]] [[goal]]s.

===Latent dissent===
Individuals may also express latent dissent in response to functional and other-focused dissent-triggering. They determine to use latent instead of articulate when they believe that [[management]] is not receptive to employee dissent. This indicates that individuals would use articulate dissent if they feel those channels are not available and accessible. Latent dissent is also used in protective dissent–triggering events.

===Displaced dissent===
Individuals will readily used displaced dissent regardless of the focus or triggering event. External [[audiences]] provide individuals with a low-[[risk]] alternative to express dissent. The downfall for organizations, however, is the loss of employee [[feedback]]. If an employee expresses their dissent to outsiders, the organization will not hear about it and will assume that less dissent exists within the organization. When an organization fails to address potential issues, employees may then view the organization as discouraging dissent and will resort to using either latent or displaced dissent in the future.

==Benefits of upward dissent==
In 2002, Kassing's research found upward dissent can be beneficial to both the organization and the individuals involved.

===Organizational benefits===
Upward dissent serves as an important monitoring force and allows the organization to identify problems and issues before they become damaging.

===Individual benefits===
Employees who express upward dissent seem more satisfied, to have better work relationships, and to identify with their organization.

==Upward dissent strategies==
Not all [[organizations]] are designed to recognize and respond to employee dissent. Furthermore, employees consider expressing upward dissent as a "risky proposition." In several studies Kassing (1997, 1998) found that employees decided to express dissent by considering whether or not they will be perceived as constructive or adversarial, as well as the risk of retaliation associated with dissenting. In 2002, Kassing found that once an individual decides to [[strategically]] express dissent, they use five different categories: direct-factual [[appeal]], [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]], [[solution]] [[presentation]], circumvention, and threatening [[resignation]].

===Direct-factual appeal===
When an employee uses factual information derived from [[physical evidence]], knowledge of organizational policies and practices, and personal [[work experience]], they use the direct-factual appeal strategy.  This strategy is considered active and constructive because the employees seek evidence and base their assumptions on facts, [[evidence]], and first-hand [[experience]]. Employees avoid using [[verbal abuse|verbal attacks]] and unsupported [[data]].

===Repetition===
[[Repetition (rhetorical device)|Repetition]] involves expressing dissent about a topic/issue repeatedly at different points in time. This strategy is often used when an employee feels nothing is being done to correct the original articulated [[problem]]/issue and feel that the issue warrants being repeated. The problem with this strategy is that repetition in a short period can be seen as [[Counterproductive work behavior|destructive]]. Especially if the abbreviated [[time frame]] does not allow the supervisor enough time to respond. However, if repetition is used over an extended time period it may be considered active–constructive since it may serve as a reminder to the supervisor.

===Solution presentation strategy===
The solution presentation strategy is deemed as active–constructive since an employee will provide [[solutions]], with or without supporting [[evidence]]. This allows the supervisor to be receptive to the expressed dissent and indicates that effort has been put into solving the problem/issue.

===Circumvention===
If an employee feels their immediate supervisors are not responsive to dissent, they may employ the circumvention strategy. This entails the employee choosing to dissent to an audience higher in the organizational [[hierarchy]]. If an employee uses this strategy before giving their supervisor they opportunity to handle the situation first, this strategy can be deemed active–destructive. However, when used to express dissent regarding [[unethical]] practices it is considered active–constructive since the dissent is issue driven.

===Threatening resignation===
Threatening [[resignation]] can also be seen as both active–constructive and active–destructive. This strategy involves the employee threatening to resign as a "form of leverage for obtaining responsiveness and action from supervisors and management." When used to express your concerns about unsafe and intolerable [[work conditions]] it is deemed constructive. However, this strategy will appear to be destructive when the managers view the threat as "[[wikt:antagonistic|antagonistic]] and unprincipled."

==Encouraging dissent in the workplace==
There are some "[[Illusion|tricks]]" that leaders can utilize to develop their employees' [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[knowledge]], and [[skills]] that are needed to foster constructive dissent.

===Change decision-making focus===
Leaders should focus on "How I should make the decision" instead of "What decision should I make." In the end, if they perform the following steps the decision the leader should make will be obvious.

===Encourage constructive conflict===
Leaders need to ensure that [[Organizational conflict|conflict]] remains constructive. That is, they must stimulate task-oriented [[disagreement]] and [[debate]] while trying to minimize [[interpersonal]] conflict. Eilerman (2006) claims that the way conflict is handled will determine whether the outcome is constructive or destructive. According to Roberto (2005) leaders can create constructive conflict by taking concrete steps before, during, and after a critical [[decision process]].

===Establish ground rules===
Before the process begins, leaders can establish ground rules for how people should interact during the [[deliberations]], clarify the [[role]] that each individual will play in the discussions, and build mutual [[respect]]. Asking individuals to [[role play]] or to become the [[devil's advocate]] ahead of time can help reduce affective conflict while also stimulating constructive conflict (Roberto, 2005).   Macy and Neal (1995) claim that since the role of the devil's advocate is to present convincing [[counterargument]]s and to challenge the main position, its benefit lies in the fact that it automatically builds conflict into the [[decision-making process]].

===Intervene when necessary===
During [[deliberations]], leaders can intervene when [[debates]] get heated. They might redirect people's attention and frame the debate in a different light, redescribe the ideas and data in novel ways so as to enhance [[understanding]] and spark new branches of [[discussion]] or may revisit ideas in hopes of finding common ground (Roberto, 2005). Deutsch and Coleman (2000) explain that reframing allows conflicting parties to see themselves as being in a [[collaborative]], while producing a positive atmosphere that is conductive to [[creativity]] and one that increases the potential solutions available.

===Reflect on the process===
After a decision process ends, leaders should reflect on the process and try to derive [[lessons]] learned regarding how to manage conflict constructively. Since reflections can lead to new [[insight]], individuals must take time to critically assess the [[experience]]. They also must address and repair any hurt feelings and damaged relationships that may not have been apparent during the process itself. If these relationships are not repaired, [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] could be lost which could negatively affect the effort of the next collaboration. Additionally, leaders should celebrate constructive conflict management and help others to remember the success of the process (Roberto, 2005).

===Establish a supportive climate===
Bennis (2004) emphasizes that corporate leaders must promise their followers that they will never be [[devalued]] or [[punish]]ed because they express dissent. All too often in the past, organizations would marginalize or [[termination of employment|terminate]] any employee who voiced an opposing view. Additionally, leaders should reward dissent and [[punish]] conflict avoiders. Anyone who clearly withholds a dissenting view only to obstruct the implementation later should be held responsible.

When leaders establish a climate of [[openness]], they make constructive conflict a habit in the organization and develop behaviors which can be sustained over time. Kassing's (2000) research found that when leaders emphasize workplace [[freedom of speech]], employees openly and clearly express dissent to audiences that are responsible for "organizational adjustment." However, for leaders to ensure this type of sustainability, they need to not only change the way they make decisions, but they must develop a pipeline of leaders who approach decision-making differently (Roberto, 2005).

==Situations that may undermine a leader's efforts==
Even if a leader takes all the steps indicated above they must be aware of four situations that can undermine their efforts (Roberto, 2005).

===Crowding out response time===
Leaders should avoid crowding out opportunities to respond or discuss policies. Overloading an [[agenda (meeting)|agenda]] can decrease the amount of time that is available for an individual to express their view.

===Appointing the same devil's advocate every time===
Employing the same person as [[devil's advocate]] can cause the view that it is an "empty [[ritual]]." It is seen as being done for procedural reasons instead of seeking dissenting views.

===Allowing too much time for subgroups===
Leaders should not allow employee [[subgroups]] to have too much time before coming together as a [[Groups of people|group]]. Doing so can cause the employees to become attached to an [[argument]] and as a result they may not be open to other ideas.

===Focusing on qualitative data===
Leaders should avoid focusing on qualitative data. The employees may become more focused on the [[data]] than the real issue(s).

==Whistle-blowing==
[[Whistle-blowing]] is a [[subset]] of [[dissent]]. It involves the expression of dissent to external organizations such as [[News media|media]] and [[political]] avenues that have the power to take corrective action. Kassing (2000) believes that the whistle-blowing process begins at the superior–subordinate relationship. If a superior response to an employee's effort to dissent is negative this may cause the employee to seek other avenues of dissent. In fact, evidence indicates that only as a last resort do the dissendents finally go public with their tales (Bennis, 2004, Kassing, 2000).

Whistle-blowers are often high-performing employees who believe they are doing their job (Martin, 2005). They just want to bring people's attention to a problem that is potentially harmful or [[unethical]].  Despite this, whistle-blowers are perceived negatively and suffer grave consequences. They are often [[ostracized]], [[harass]]ed, and attacked by their superiors and coworkers. They face [[Termination of employment|termination]], [[Finance|financial losses]], [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], relationship breakdown, and [[health]] problems. Even worse, few whistle-blowers seem to bring about any change. The organization seems to put all their efforts into destroying the whistle-blower while ignoring the original problem. The organization will take great measures to [[cover-up]] the problem, [[devalue]] the target, reinterpret the events, and [[Intimidation|intimidate]] and/or [[bribe]] the whistle-blowers (Martin, 2005).

Organizations need to realize that internal dissent is not itself a [[crisis]], but rather priceless [[insurance]] against [[disaster]]. Until the ugly headlines appear and the consequences are unavoidable, companies too often forget that they will suffer far more for ignoring their principled dissendents than by giving them a hearing (Bennis, 2004).

'''Pederasty''' or '''paederasty''' ({{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|p|ɛ|d|ər|æ|s|t|i}} or {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|p|iː|d|ər|æ|s|t|i}}) is a (usually erotic) [[homosexual]] relationship between an adult male and a [[Puberty|pubescent]] or [[Adolescence|adolescent]] male. The word ''pederasty'' derives from Greek {{lang|grc|παιδεραστία}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|paiderastia}}'') "love of boys",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition: Pederasty|url=http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/pederasty|website=websters-online-dictionary.org|publisher=Websters Online Dictionary|accessdate=19 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211132000/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/pederasty|archivedate=11 December 2006|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; a compound derived from {{lang|grc|παῖς}} (''pais'') "child, boy" and {{lang|grc|ἐραστής}} (''erastēs'') "lover". In French, however, "pédérastie" has been used as a synonym for homosexuality between adult males (see ''[[:fr:Histoire du mot pédérastie|Histoire du mot pédérastie]]'').

Historically, pederasty has existed as a variety of customs and practices within different cultures. The status of pederasty has changed over the course of history, at times accepted and at other times a crime. In the history of Europe, its most structured cultural manifestation was [[Athenian pederasty]], and became most prominent in the 6th century [[Before Christ|BC]]. [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|Greek pederasty's]] various forms were the subject of philosophic debates in which the purely [[Hubris#Ancient Greek origin|carnal type]] was unfavorably compared with erotic friendships and moderate forms, known as ''[[Sophrosyne]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Symposium by Plato&lt;/ref&gt;

In most countries today, the local [[age of consent]] determines whether or not a person is considered legally competent to consent to sexual acts, and whether such contact is [[Child sexual abuse|abusive to the young person]], under the law.

Anthropologists propose three subdivisions of [[homosexuality]]: age-structured, egalitarian and gender-structured.&lt;ref name="www2.fmg.uva.nl"&gt;[http://www2.fmg.uva.nl/gl/queerant.html ''Queering Anthropology'' [[Theo Sandfort]] e.a. (eds) ''Lesbian and Gay Studies,'' London/NY, Routledge, 2000 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Greenberg, David F. |title=The construction of homosexuality |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1990 |page=25|isbn=0-226-30628-3 |oclc= |doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pederasty is the archetypal example of male age-structured homosexuality.&lt;ref name="www2.fmg.uva.nl"/&gt;
[[Geoffrey Gorer]] and others distinguish pederasty from pedophilia, which he defined as a separate, fourth type that he described as "grossly pathological in all societies of which we have record." According to Gorer, the main characteristic of homosexual pederasty is the age difference (either of generation or age-group) between the partners. In his study of native cultures pederasty appears typically as a passing stage in which the adolescent is the beloved of an older male, remains as such until he reaches a certain developmental threshold, after which he in turn takes on an adolescent beloved of his own. This model is judged by Gorer as socially viable, i.e. not likely to give rise to psychological discomfort or neuroses for all or most males. He adds that in many societies, pederasty has been the main subject of the arts and the main source of tender and elevated emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Gorer, ''The Danger of Equality and other Essays'' pp.186–187&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age range===

Some modern observers restrict the age of the younger partner to "generally between twelve and seventeen",&lt;ref name=GLBTQ/&gt; though historically the spread was somewhat greater. The younger partner must, in some sense, not be fully mature; this could include young men in their late teens or early twenties.&lt;ref&gt;David Menasco, "Pederasty" in the ''Encyclopedia of Gay Histories and Cultures:'' Volume 2; p.672&lt;/ref&gt;

While relationships in ancient Greece involved boys from 12 to about 17 or 18,&lt;ref&gt;Cantarella, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; in Renaissance Italy they typically involved boys between 14 and 19,&lt;ref&gt;Pederasts and others: urban culture and sexual identity in nineteenth ...

==History==
[[File:Cretan hunters Louvre Br93.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Man and youth. Cretan ex-voto from Hermes and Aphrodite shrine at Kato Syme; Bronze, c. 670–650 BC]]

In antiquity, pederasty was seen as an [[educational institution]] for the inculcation of moral and cultural values in some cultures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Greek Achievement: The Foundation of the Western World|last= Freeman|first= Charles|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1999|publisher= Allen Lane|location= |isbn= 0-7139-9224-7|pages= 299–300|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a form of sexual expression. Its practice dates from the Archaic period onwards in [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|Ancient Greece]], but [[Cretan pederasty|Cretan ritual objects]] that reflect an already-formalised practice date to the late [[Minoan civilization]], in around 1650 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce L. Gerig, "Homosexuality in the Ancient Near East, beyond Egypt", in ''HOMOSEXUALITY AND THE BIBLE,'' Supplement 11A, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Plato]],&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Phaedrus''; passim&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ancient Greece]], pederasty was a [[intimate relationship|relationship]] and bond, whether sexual or chaste, between an [[adolescent]] [[boy]] and an [[adult]] [[man]] outside of his immediate family. While most Greek men engaged in relations with both girls and boys,&lt;ref&gt;J.K. Dover, ''Greek Homosexuality''; passim&lt;/ref&gt; exceptions to the rule were known, some avoiding relations with women, and others rejecting relations with boys. In [[Ancient Rome]], relations with boys took a more informal and less civic path, men taking advantage of dominant social status to extract sexual favors from their social inferiors or carrying on illicit relationships with freeborn boys.&lt;ref&gt;Crompton, op.cit., pp.79–82&lt;/ref&gt;

Analogous relations were documented among other ancient peoples, such as the [[Thrace|Thracians]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses,'' 10.67–85&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Celts]] ([[Posidonius]]). According to [[Plutarch]], the ancient [[Persian Empire|Persians]] had long practiced it as well, an opinion seconded by [[Sextus Empiricus]] who asserted that the laws of the Persians "recommended" the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/eresources/exhibitions/sw25/bentham/index.html#01 |author=Jeremy Bentham |title=Offences Against One's Self |journal=Journal of Homosexuality |orig-year=1978 |pages=389–405 |via=Columbia.edu |date=2010-06-11 |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]], however, asserts they learned copulation with boys ''(παισὶ μίσγονται)'' from the Greeks,&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories,'' I.135&lt;/ref&gt; by the use of that term reducing their practice to what [[John Addington Symonds]] describes as the "vicious form" of pederasty,&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Symonds, ''A Problem in Greek Ethics;'' V.&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the more restrained and cultured one valued by the Greeks. Plutarch, however, counters Herodotus by pointing out that the Persians had been castrating boys long before being exposed to the mores of the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''On the Malice of Herodotus;''13&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to the carnal aspects of pederasty existed concurrently with the practice, both inside and outside of the cultures in which it was found. Among the Greeks, a few cities prohibited it, and in others, such as [[Spartan pederasty|Sparta]], only the chaste form of pederasty was permitted, according to Xenophon&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''Constitution of the Lacedaemonians,'' 2.12–14&lt;/ref&gt; and others. Likewise, Plato's writings devalue and then condemn sexual intercourse with the boys one loved, and he valued the self-disciplined lover who abstained from consummating the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Phaedrus'', passim&lt;/ref&gt;

Judaism and Christianity also condemned [[sodomy]] (while defining that term variously), a theme that would be promulgated by Islam and, later still, by the [[Homosexuality and Bahá'í Faith|Baha'i Faith]]. Within the Baha'i faith, pederasty is the only type of homosexuality mentioned by [[Bahá'u'lláh]]. "We shrink, for very shame, from treating of the subject of boys.... Commit not that which is forbidden you in Our Holy Tablet, and be not of those who rove distractedly in the wilderness of their desires."&lt;ref&gt;Bahá'u'lláh, ''The Kitab-i-Aqdas,'' p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The word translated here as 'boys' has, in this context, in the Arabic original, the implication of paederasty. Shoghi Effendi has interpreted this reference as a prohibition on all homosexual relations." [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-151.html.iso8859-1?query=boys&amp;action=highlight#]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the blanket condemnation of sodomy, pederasty was a particular target. The 2nd-century preacher [[Clement of Alexandria]] used divine pederasty as an indictment of [[religion in ancient Greece|Greek religion]] and the [[Greek mythology|mythological]] figures of [[Herakles]], [[Apollo]], [[Poseidon]], [[Laius]], and [[Zeus]]: "For your gods did not abstain even from boys. One loved [[Hylas]], another [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinth]]us, another [[Pelops]], another [[Chrysippus (mythology)|Chrysippus]], another [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymedes]]. These are the gods your wives are to worship!"&lt;ref&gt;Clement of Alexandria, Exhortation to the Greeks 2.28P&lt;/ref&gt; Early legal codes prescribed harsh penalties for violators. The law code of the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] king [[Chindasuinth]] called for both partners to be "[[emasculation|emasculated]] without delay, and be delivered up to the [[bishop]] of the [[diocese]] where the deed was committed to be placed in solitary confinement in a prison."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ed. S. P. Scott |url=http://libro.uca.edu/vcode/vg3-5.htm |title=The Library of Iberian Resources, The Visigothic Code: (Forum judicum) ed. S. P. Scott, Book III: Concerning Marriage, Title V: Concerning Incest, Apostasy, and Pederasty |publisher=Libro.uca.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; These punishments were often linked to the penance given after the [[Sacrament of Confession]]. At [[Rome]], the punishment was burning at the stake since the time of [[Theodosius I]] (390). Nonetheless, the practice continued to surface, giving rise to proverbs such as ''With wine and boys around, the monks have no need of the Devil to tempt them,'' an early Christian saying from the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, E., ''A History of Celibacy,'' New York, 2000; p.101&lt;/ref&gt;

Pederasty was notable in [[Moorish Spain]],&lt;ref&gt;Arié, Rachel. ''España musulmana'' (Siglos VIII-XV) in ''Historia de España,'' ed. Manuel Tuñón de Lara, III. Barcelona: Labor, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tuscany]] and northern [[Italy]] during the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Rocke, ''Forbidden Friendships: Homosexuality and male Culture in Renaissance Florence,'' Oxford, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guido Ruggiero, ''The Boundaries of Eros: Sex Crime and Sexuality in Renaissance Venice,'' Oxford, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; and also medieval and [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.gay.ru/life/history/queermoscow/1600-1861TraditionalMasculinitiesAndLoveBetweenMen.html |title='&amp;#39;Urban Gay Histories up to 1600 |publisher=English.gay.ru |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere, it was practiced in [[Shudo|pre-Modern Japan]] until the [[Meiji restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Watanabe &amp; J. Iwata, ''The Love of the Samurai: A Thousand Years of Japanese Homosexuality,'' London: GMP Publishers, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

In many societies, such as Ancient Greece, it was justified on the grounds that love was the best foundation for teaching courage as well as civic and cultural values and that homoerotic love between males was superior to other forms of love.&lt;ref name=livius.org /&gt;

==Etymology and usage==
''Pederasty'' derives from the combination of ''{{lang|grc|παίδ-}}'' (the Greek stem for ''boy''&lt;ref&gt;Marguerite Johnson, Terry Ryan''Sexuality in Greek and Roman Society and Literature: A Sourcebook'' p.110&lt;/ref&gt; or ''child'')&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott, 1968 p.585&lt;/ref&gt; with ''{{lang|grc|ἐραστής}}'' (Greek for ''lover''; cf. ''[[eros (love)|eros]]''). Late [[Latin]] ''pæderasta'' was borrowed in the 16th century directly from Plato's classical Greek in ''The Symposium.'' (Latin transliterates ''{{lang|grc|αί}}'' as ''æ''.) The word first appeared in the English language during the [[Renaissance]], as ''pæderastie'' (e.g. in [[Samuel Purchas]]' ''Pilgrimes''), in the sense of sexual relations between men and boys. Beside its use in the classical sense, the term has also been used as a synonym for [[anal sex]], irrespective of the nature of the partner. A 19th-century sexological treatise discusses men practicing the "insertion of the penis into the anus of women," as "pederasty with their wives."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Krafft-Ebing, ''Psychopathia Sexualis.'' p.397; Arcade, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the term has been used to refer to any homosexual activity, regardless of the participants' ages. Jeremy Bentham used the term in this broader sense in an essay dating from the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bentham, Jeremy. [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/eresources/exhibitions/sw25/bentham/index.html "Offences Against One's Self"], first published in Journal of Homosexuality, v.3:4(1978), p.389–405; continued in v.4:1(1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

The commonly accepted reference definitions of pederasty refer to a sexual relationship, or to copulation, between older and younger males. The OED offers: "Homosexual relations between a man and a boy; homosexual anal intercourse, usually with a boy or younger man as the passive partner."&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, "pederasty".&lt;/ref&gt; The concise OED has: "Sexual intercourse between a man and a boy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/pederasty?view=uk|title=Oxford Dictionaries – Dictionary, Thesaurus, &amp; Grammar|work=askoxford.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When describing pederasts, some focus solely on the mechanics of copulation, such as the ''Merriam-Webster'' (on-line edition): "one who practices anal intercourse especially with a boy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pederasty |title='&amp;#39;Definition of Pederasty'&amp;#39;, Merriam Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other dictionaries offer a more general definition, such as "homosexual relations between men and boys"&lt;ref&gt;''Collins English Dictionary,'' Desktop edition; Harper Collins Publishers, Glasgow 2004&lt;/ref&gt; or "homosexual relations, especially between a male adult and a boy or young man."&lt;ref&gt;''American Heritage Illustrated Encyclopedic Dictionary,'' Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; The limitation of pederasty to anal sex with a boy is contested by sexologists. Francoeur regards it as "common but incorrect,"&lt;ref&gt;Robert T. Francoeur, Ed. ''The Complete Dictionary of Sexology'' p.470; Continuum Publishing, NY 1995&lt;/ref&gt; while Haeberle describes it as "a modern usage resulting from a misunderstanding of the original term and ignorance of its historical implications."&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Haeberle, ''Critical Dictionary of Sexology''[http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/CDS.HTM#P] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025055956/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/CDS.HTM |date=2008-10-25 }}; accessed 10/12/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic and social studies sources propose more expansive definitions of the term. The Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender &amp; Queer Culture defines the term as: "The erotic relationship between an adult male and a youth, generally one between the ages of twelve and seventeen, in which the older partner is attracted to the younger one who returns his affection."&lt;ref name="GLBTQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/pederasty.html |title='&amp;#39;Pederasty'&amp;#39;, An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender &amp; Queer Culture, Vern L.

==Social class factors==

In Athens, the slaves were expressly forbidden from entering into pederastic relations with the free-born boys. In medieval Islamic civilization, pederastic relations "were so readily accepted in upper-class circles that there was often little or no effort to conceal their existence."&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam,'' Chicago and London, 1974; 2:146&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Greeks===

:''Main articles: [[Pederasty in ancient Greece]]''

Plato was an early critic of sexual intercourse in pederastic relationships, proposing that men's love of boys avoid all carnal expression and instead progress from admiration of the lover's specific virtues to love of virtue itself in abstract form. While copulation with boys was often criticized and seen as shameful and brutish,&lt;ref&gt;Aeschines, "Against Timarchos" 127&lt;/ref&gt;{{By whom|date=July 2018}} other aspects of the relationship were considered beneficial, as indicated in proverbs such as ''A lover is the best friend a boy will ever have.''&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]],'' 231&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Art grècia.jpg|thumb|left|'''At the [[palaestra]]'''&lt;br&gt;Youth, holding a net shopping bag filled with walnuts, a love gift, draws close to a man who reaches out to fondle him; Attic red-figure plate 530–430 BC; [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]].]]

Pederastic art shows seduction scenes as well as sexual relations. In the seduction scenes the man is standing, grasping the boy's chin with one hand and reaching to fondle his genitals with the other. In the sexual scenes, the partners stand embracing face to face, the older of the two engaged in [[intercrural sex]] with the younger, who (usually but not always) does not show arousal. Anal sex is almost never shown, and then only as something eliciting surprise in the observers. The practice was ostensibly disparaged, the Athenians often naming it jocularly after their Dorian neighbors ("cretanize," "laconize," "chalcidize"). While historians such as Dover and Halperin hold that only the man experienced pleasure, art and poetry indicate reciprocation of desire, and other historians assert that it is "a modern fairy tale that the younger eromenos was never aroused."&lt;ref name=livius.org&gt;{{cite web|author=Hein van Dolen |url=http://www.livius.org/ho-hz/homosexuality/homosexuality.html |title='&amp;#39;Greek homosexuality'&amp;#39;, Hein van Dolen |publisher=Livius.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pederastic couples were also said to be feared by tyrants, because the bond between the friends was stronger than that of obedience to a tyrannical ruler. Plutarch gives as examples the Athenians [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton]]. Others, such as Aristotle, claimed that the Cretan lawgivers encouraged pederasty as a means of [[population control]], by directing love and sexual desire into relations with males.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politics'' 2.1272a 22–24 "and the lawgiver has devised many wise measures to secure the benefit of moderation at table, and the segregation of the women in order that they may not bear many children, for which purpose he instituted association with the male sex."&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Romans===

{{Main|Homosexuality in ancient Rome}}

[[File:Rilievo con ganimede, fine I sec. dc. 01.JPG|thumb|Jupiter abducting Ganymede; 1st-century AD Roman statue]]

From the early Republican times of [[Ancient Rome]], it was perfectly normal for an older man to desire and pursue boys.&lt;ref&gt;Craig A. Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'' p.23&lt;/ref&gt; However, penetration was illegal for free-born youths; the only boys who were legally allowed to perform as a passive sexual partner were slaves or former slaves known as "freedmen", and then only with regard to their former masters. For slaves there was no protection under the law even against rape.&lt;ref name= Prioreschi&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Medicine |first=Plinio |last=Prioreschi |year=1996 |publisher=Horatius Press |pages=21–23, 29 |isbn=1-888456-03-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was that in [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] times, pederasty largely lost its function as a ritual part of education and was instead seen as an activity primarily driven by one's sexual desires and competing with desire for women. The social acceptance of pederastic relations waxed and waned during the centuries. Conservative thinkers condemned it – along with other forms of indulgence. [[Tacitus]] attacks the Greek customs of ''gymnasia et otia et turpes amores'' ([[palaestra]]e, idleness, and shameful loves).&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annales,'' 14.20&lt;/ref&gt; The emperors, however, indulged in male love – most of it of a pederastic nature. As [[Edward Gibbon]] mentions, of the first fifteen emperors, "[[Claudius]] was the only one whose taste in love was entirely correct", the implication being that he was the only one not to take men or boys as lovers.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,'' footnote on p. 76, vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers spent no effort censuring pederasty ''per se'', but praised or blamed its various aspects. [[Martial]] appears to have favored it, going as far as to essentialize not the sexual use of the [[catamite]] but his nature as a boy: upon being discovered by his wife "inside a boy" and offered the "same thing" by her, he retorts with a list of mythological personages who, despite being married, took young male lovers, and concludes by rejecting her offer since "a woman merely has two vaginas."&lt;ref&gt;Martial, ''Epigrams,'' XI.43&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other venues===

Pederasty in ancient times was not the exclusive domain of the Greeks and Romans. Athenaeus in the ''Deipnosophists'' states that the [[Celts]] also partook and despite the beauty of their women, preferred the love of boys. Some would regularly bed down on their animal skins with a lover on each side. Other writers also attest to Celtic pederasty: [[Aristotle]] (Politics, II 6.6. Athen. XIII 603a.), Strabo (iv. 199), and [[Diodorus Siculus]] (v. 32)). Some moderns have interpreted Athenaeus as meaning that the Celts had a boy on each side, but that interpretation is questioned by Hubbard, who reads it as meaning that they had a boy one side and a woman on the other. (Hubbard, 2003; p.&amp;nbsp;79) The [[Sibylline oracles]] claim that only the Jews were free from this impurity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[The Jews] are mindful of holy wedlock,&lt;br&gt;
and they do not engage in impious intercourse with male children,&lt;br&gt;
as do Phoenicians, Egyptians and Romans,&lt;br&gt;
spacious Greece and many nations of other,&lt;br&gt;
Persians and Galatians and all Asia, transgressing&lt;br&gt;
the holy law of immortal God, which they transgressed.&lt;ref&gt;Where is boasting? By Simon J. Gathercole; p.175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Persian pederasty and its origins was debated even in ancient times. [[Herodotus]] claimed they had learned it from the Greeks: "From the Greeks they have learned to lie with boys."&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories,'' I.135, tr. David Grene; p.97&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Plutarch]] asserts that the Persians used eunuch boys to that end long before contact between the cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''De Malig. Herod.'' xiii.ll&lt;/ref&gt; In either case, Plato claimed they saw fit to forbid it to the inhabitants of the lands they occupied, since "It does not suit the rulers that their subjects should think noble thoughts, nor that they should form the strong friendships and attachments which these activities, and in particular love, tend to produce."&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Symposium,'' 182c, trans. Tom Griffith&lt;/ref&gt;

In pre-modern Islam there was a "widespread conviction that beardless youths possessed a temptation to adult men as a whole, and not merely to a small minority of deviants".&lt;ref&gt;El-Rouayheb, 2005. Op.cit. p.115&lt;/ref&gt; This was despite the widespread belief of pederastic relations being immoral.&lt;ref&gt;Holy Qur'an, surah Al A'raf verses 80 – 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Osman Agha of [[Timişoara|Temeşvar]] who fell captive to the [[Austrian people|Austrians]] in 1688 wrote in his memoirs that one night an Austrian boy approached him for sex, telling him "for I know all Turks are pederasts".&lt;ref&gt;Temeşvarlı Osman Ağa, ''Gâvurların Esiri'', Istanbul, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1770s, Âşık Sadık the poet wrote, in an address to the Sultan: ''Lût kavmi döğüşür, put kavmi bozar. Askerin lûtîdir, bil Padişahım'' ("The people of Lot fight, the people of idolatry spoil. Know, my Sultan, that your soldiers are sodomites").&lt;ref&gt;Hulki Aktunç, ''Erotologya'', Istanbul, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of Ottoman criminal law, which is based on the [[Sharia]], reveal that persistent sodomy with non-consenting boys was a serious offense and those convicted faced [[capital punishment]].

===China===

Men's sexual interest in youths was reflected in prostitution, with young male sex workers fetching higher prices than their female counterparts as recently as the beginning of the 20th century. In [[Tianjin]] there were thirty-five male brothels, housing 800 boys. Although the superintendent of trade at [[Guangzhou]] issued an annual warning to the population against permitting Westerners access to boy prostitutes ("do not indulge the Western barbarian with all our best favors"), Europeans were increasingly welcomed in the boy brothels.&lt;ref&gt;''Empire and Sexuality: The British Experience,'' Ronald Hyam; p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

In 10th-century China courting male couples consisted of the older qi xiong (契兄) and the younger qi di. (契弟) (The terms mean, literally, sworn elder brother and younger brother. It is very common in the Chinese culture to conceptualize many kinds of alliances as fictive kinship relationships). Boy marriages, which lasted for a set period after which the younger partner would find a wife (often with the help of the older one) appear to have been part of the culture in the province of Fujian in pre-modern times. The marriages were said to have been celebrated by the two families in traditional fashion, including the ritual "nine cups of tea".{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The popularity of these pederastic relationships in [[Chang'an]]{{'}}s gay quarters gave rise to one of the euphemistic expressions for same-sex love in China, "the southern custom". Along with the concentration of Chang'an{{'}}s gay community here, the North Hamlet was also heavily concentrated with many of the city's entertaining courtesans, as well as its notorious brothel houses for prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Benn, Charles (2002). ''China's Golden Age: Everyday Life in the Tang Dynasty''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-517665-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was another term in ancient China, ''luan tong'' ({{CJKV|s=娈童|t=孌童}}), which means a beautiful little boy who has sexual attraction to an adult man. Some emperors in ancient China had some ''luan tong'' in their palaces for sexual intercourse or making fun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[:s:zh:閱微草堂筆記/卷12|閱微草堂筆記·槐西雜志二]]|quote=雜說稱孌童始黃帝|author=紀曉嵐}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[:s:zh:北史/卷007|北史·齊本紀中第七·廢帝]]|quote=散愁自少以來，不登孌童之牀，不入季女之室|author=李延壽}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===

{{Main|Shudo}}

In Japan, the practice of '''shudō''' (衆道), "the Way of the Young", paralleled closely the course of [[Europe]]an pederasty. It was prevalent in the religious community and [[samurai]] society from the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] period on, and eventually grew to permeate all of society. It fell out of favor around the end of the 19th century, concurrently with the growing European influence.

Its legendary founder is [[Kūkai]], also known as Kōbō Daishi, the founder of the [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]] school of [[Buddhism]], who is said to have brought the teachings of male love over from China, together with the teachings of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. Monks often entered into love relationships with beautiful youths known as ''chigo'' (稚児), which were recorded in literary works known as ''chigo monogatari'' (稚児物語).&lt;ref&gt;T. Watanabe &amp; J. Iwata, ''The Love of the Samurai. A Thousand Years of Japanese Homosexuality,'' pp.31–2&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Japanese [[manga]], attraction to young boys is called [[shotacon]], while relationships involving older adolescents and adults is called [[yaoi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pandey|first=Ashish|title=Dictionary of Fiction|publisher=Gyan Books|year=2005|page=234|isbn=81-8205-262-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===

Late 19th-century historian [[Hubert Howe Bancroft]] reported in his study of the native culture of [[Kodiak Island]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'The most repugnant of all their practices is that of male [[concubinage]]. A Kodiak mother will select her handsomest and most promising boy, and dress and rear him as a girl, teaching him only domestic duties, keeping him at women's work, associating him with women and girls, in order to render his effeminacy complete. Arriving at the age of ten or fifteen years, he is married to some wealthy man who regards such a companion as a great acquisition. These male concubines are called Achnutschik or Schopans' (the authorities quoted being Holmberg, Langsdorff, Billing, Choris, Lisiansky and Marchand). The same is the case in [[Nootka Sound]] and the [[Aleutian Islands]], where 'male concubinage obtains throughout, but not to the same extent as amongst the Koniagas.' The male concubines have their beards carefully plucked out as soon as the face-hair begins to grow, and their chins are tattooed like those of the women. In [[California]] the first missionaries found the same practice, the youths being called Joya.&lt;ref&gt;(Bancroft, i. 415 and authorities Palon, Crespi, Boscana, Motras, Torquemada, Duflot and Fages). (R. F. Burton, ''Terminal Essay)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Central America===

Though early [[Mayans]] are thought to have been strongly antagonistic to same-sex relationships, later Mayan states employed pederastic practices. Their introduction was ascribed to the god [[Chin (Mayan god)|Chin]]. One aspect was that of the father procuring a younger lover for his son. [[Fray Juan de Torquemada|Juan de Torquemada]] mentions that if the (younger) boy was seduced by a stranger, the penalty was equivalent to that for adultery. [[Bernal Diaz]] reported statues of male pairs making love in the temples at [[Cape Catoche]], [[Yucatan]].&lt;ref&gt;Pete Sigal, "The Politicization of Pederasty among the Colonial Yucatecan Maya" in ''Journal of the History of Sexuality,'' Vol. 8, No. 1 (Jul., 1997), pp. 1–24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

Pederastic eros in the Christian West, while remaining mostly hidden, has nevertheless revealed itself in a variety of settings. Legal records are one of the more important windows into this secret world, since for much of the time pederastic relations, like other forms of homosexual relations, were illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Rocke, Forbidden Friendships, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; The expression of desire through literature and art, albeit in coded fashion, can also afford a view of the pederastic interests of the author.

Reflecting the conflicted outlook on male loves, some northern European writers ascribed pederastic tendencies to populations in southern latitudes. [[Richard Francis Burton]] evolved his theory of the ''[[Sotadic zone]]'', an area bounded roughly by N. Lat. 43° N. Lat. 30°, stretching from the western shores of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Burton, ''Arabian Nights'' "Terminal Essay"&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Wilhelm Kroll]], writing in the [[Pauly-Wissowa]] encyclopaedia in 1906, asserted that "The roots of pederasty are found first of all in the existence of a contrary sexual feeling that is probably more frequent in southern regions than in countries with moderate climates."&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Kroll, "Knabenliebe" [boy-love or pederasty], article in Pauly-Wissowa, Realencyclopaedie der klassischen Altertumswissenschaft, vol. 11, cols. 897–906&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Renaissance====

{{Main|Pederasty in the Renaissance}}

According to [[glbtq.com]], during [[the Renaissance]], "The most conventional object of homoerotic desire was the adolescent youth, usually imagined as beardless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/eur_art7_renaissance,3.html |title=An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender &amp; Queer Culture, '&amp;#39;European Art: Renaissance'&amp;#39;, Patricia Simmons |publisher=Glbtq.com |date=2006-09-15 |accessdate=2014-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226222818/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/eur_art7_renaissance,3.html |archivedate=2013-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====England====

[[File:Tuke, Henry Scott (1858–1929) - 1911 - Bathing group (Noonday heat).jpg|thumb|190px|'''Noonday Heat''' (1911)&lt;br/&gt;By [[Henry Scott Tuke]] (1858–1929). Many of Tuke's best-known works are nudes of young men and boys, and the artist is closely associated with the [[Uranian]] movement.]]

In [[England]], public [[boarding schools]], with their [[homosocial]] environment, often encouraged an [[homoerotic]] atmosphere, due to the emphasis on the Classics, and homosexual relations were formed and quietly accepted, both between older and younger boys and even between teachers and pupils; however, some scandals arose around such relationships.  In the mid-19th century, [[William Johnson Cory]], a renowned master at Eton from 1845 until his forced resignation in 1872, evolved a style of pedagogic pederasty which influenced a number of his pupils.  His ''Ionica,'' a work of poetry reflecting his pederastic sensibilities, was read in intellectual circles and "made a stir" at Oxford in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Reade, ''Sexual Heretics;'' p.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oscar Browning]], another Eton master and former student of Cory, followed in his tutor's footsteps, only to be likewise dismissed in 1875.  Both are thought to have influenced Oxford don [[Walter Pater]], whose aesthetics promoted pederasty as the truest expression of classical culture.&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Wood, "Creating the Sensual Child: Paterian Aesthetics, Pederasty, and Oscar Wilde's Fairy Tales" in ''Marvels &amp; Tales'' – Volume 16, Number 2, 2002, pp. 156–170&lt;/ref&gt;

Pederasty also was a theme in the work of several nineteenth-century English writers known as the "[[Uranian poets]]".  Most now are considered no more than minor literary figures, but the most prominent [[Uranian]] representatives – [[Walter Pater]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]], and [[Oscar Wilde]] – are renowned worldwide.  Both Wilde and Hopkins were deeply influenced by Pater's work.  Wilde wrote of pederastic and homoerotic culture – though not in the "elevated" pederastic sense that it held for Pater and Hopkins&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kaylor, ''Secreted Desires: The Major Uranians: Hopkins, Pater and Wilde'', 2006, pp. 292–295&lt;/ref&gt; – in a number of works.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Reade, 1970, op.cit., p.28&lt;/ref&gt;  And though "Hopkins often was, it must be admitted, strikingly Ruskinian in his love of Aristotelian particulars and their arrangements . . . , it was at the foot of Pater – the foremost Victorian unifier of 'eros, pedagogy, and aesthetics' – that Hopkins would ever remain."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kaylor, ''Secreted Desires'', 2006, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;  Another notable late-nineteenth-century writer on pederasty was [[John Addington Symonds]], whose essays, "A Problem in Greek Ethics" and "A Problem in Modern Ethics", were amongst the first defenses of [[homosexuality]] made in the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/lgbt/pge/index.htm |title=A Problem in Greek Ethics Index |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reaction and retrenchment====
The end of the 19th century saw increasing conflict over the issue of social acceptance of pederasty. A number of other pederastic scandals erupted around this time, such as the one involving the [[Germany|German]] industrialist [[Krupp#Friedrich Alfred's era|Friedrich Alfred Krupp]], which drove him to suicide.

This strife also involved the [[Wandervogel]] movement, a youth organization emphasizing a romantic view of nature. Wandervogel took flight in 1896, the same year that the journal ''[[Der Eigene]]'' went to press. It was published by a twenty-two-year-old German, [[Adolf Brand]], and it advocated classical pederasty as a cure for the moral flabbiness of German youth. Influenced by the ideas of [[Gustav Wyneken]], the Wandervogel movement was quite open about its homoerotic tendencies, although this kind of affection was supposed to be expressed in a nonsexual way. The founding of Young Wandervogel happened largely as a reaction to the public scandal about these erotic tendencies, which were said to alienate young men from women.

Until the 1970s, English "[[Public school (UK)|public schools]]" were walled boarding schools, educating adolescent boys only, with a strong concentration on Greek and Latin classics. They continued to be "hotbeds of pederasty" into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;H. Montgomery Hyde, ''The Love That Dared Not Speak Its Name,'' pp.110–112; Boston: Little, Brown, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. S. Lewis]] when talking about his life at [[Malvern College]], an [[Public school (UK)|English public school]], acknowledged that pederasty "was the only counterpoise to the social struggle; the one oasis (though green only with weeds and moist only with foetid water) in the burning desert of competitive ambition."&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Lewis, ''Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life'' Harvest Books (1966) p.106&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
===The Aeneid===
{{Main|The Aeneid}}

In the [[Aeneid]] of [[Vergil]], Nisus, a Trojan soldier, is in a relationship with Euryalus, a younger Trojan soldier.&lt;ref&gt;Vergil Aeneid http://classics.mit.edu/Virgil/aeneid.html&lt;/ref&gt; Although Vergil avoids directly describing the nature of their relationship due to the decorum of the [[epic poem]], the nature of their relationship has been the source of academic discourse. While some believe the relationship to be platonic,&lt;ref&gt;Makowski, John F. "Nisus and Euryalus: A Platonic Relationship." The Classical Journal 85.1 (1989): 1–15.&lt;/ref&gt; others describe it as pederastic.

==Modern expressions==
In modern thought, same-sex relations with adolescents is regarded as an abuse of power when the older partner is in a position of [[Academic seduction|educational]], [[Spiritual abuse|religious]], [[Sexual harassment|economic]], or other form of institutional authority over the younger partner. Pederasty therefore remains widely censured and instances of it have had severe political repercussions (for example, the [[Mark Foley scandal]], or "Pagegate",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fortier|first1=John|title=Pagegate to cost GOP a seat|url=http://thehill.com/john-fortier/pagegate-to-cost-gop-a-seat-2006-10-04.html|website=thehill.com|publisher=The Hill|accessdate=19 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206040349/http://thehill.com/john-fortier/pagegate-to-cost-gop-a-seat-2006-10-04.html|archivedate=6 December 2008|date=4 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which broke out in the [[United States]] in 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/article/40840 |title="Warning Signs;" '&amp;#39;New York Sun'&amp;#39; Editorial, October 4, 2006 |publisher=Nysun.com |date=2006-10-04 |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some "gay-positive" writers, in their work of interpreting [[Christian]] teachings, have concluded that [[Paul (apostle)|Paul's]] criticism of same-sex love do not target those for whom such affections come naturally, but rather those who indulge such pleasures by choice, with the example given being "the Hellenistic practice of erotic behavior with young males." Their work suggests that religious opposition to same sex relations should restrict itself to pederastic relationships, with their presumed abuse of power. But a position paper of the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] rejects that contention, claiming that,

{{quote|The Graeco-Roman "ideal" did not entail erotic love of children, but of young (teenage) males, of the same age that young woman would be given in marriage. Frequently the more mature male was only slightly older than the partner. Had Paul intended to proscribe pederasty by using these terms (such as we understand pederasty today), he had recourse to many other more precise terms. In fact, the discussion in Romans, with its inclusion of female homoerotic behaviour, indicates that exploitation and victimisation were not the issue. (Paul has a lot to say about the abuse of power elsewhere).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augustinecollege.org/papers/EH_00_3.htm Position paper: "How Is Homosexuality Understood in Scripture, Tradition, and in Contemporary Theology?"], AugustineCollege.org (retrieved 28 Oct 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On February 2, 1961 the [[Holy See|Vatican]] issued a document, ''Instruction on the Careful Selection and Training of Candidates for the States of Perfection and Sacred Orders'', barring from the priesthood anyone who has "perverse inclinations to homosexuality or pederasty."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9436430/ "Vatican document reaffirms policy on gays"], msnbc.com (retrieved 28 Oct 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, [[social guidance film]] director [[Sid Davis]] released his now infamous film, ''[[Boys Beware]]''. [[Timothy Farrell]] narrates the film; ironically, Farrell had appeared earlier in another [[LGBT film]], ''[[Glen or Glenda]]''. Davis plays the role of the first pederast.&lt;ref&gt;''Boys Beware - 1961 Educational Film - S88TV1.'' Dir. [[Sid Davis]]. YouTube. Online Video Media. YouTube.com. Retrieved 15 July. 2017. &lt;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8NZvtvt2JqA&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child abuse issues===

Though pederasty was once accepted in many cultures, some modern observers have retrospectively labeled it [[sexual abuse|abusive]]. Enid Bloch argues that many Greek boys who were involved in paederastic relationships may have been harmed by the experience, if the relationship included [[anal sex]]. Bloch writes that the boy may have been [[psychological trauma|traumatized]] by knowing that he was violating social customs. According to her, the "most shameful thing that could happen to any Greek male was penetration by another male." In this respect Bloch is in accord with Greek sexual morality, which also recognized a difference between ethical pederasty which excluded anal sex and "hubristic" pederasty which was believed to debase the boy as well as the man who penetrated him.&lt;ref&gt;David Cohen, "Sexuality, Violence, and the Athenian Law of 'Hubris'"; ''Greece and Rome,'' Second Series, V.38;#2; Oct. 1991pp.171–188&lt;/ref&gt;
	 	
Bloch further argues that vases showing "a boy standing perfectly still as a man reaches out for his genitals" indicate the boy may have been "psychologically immobilized, unable to move or run away."&lt;ref name=Bloch&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sex between Men and Boys in Classical Greece: Was It Education for Citizenship or Child Abuse?|journal=The Journal of Men's Studies |url=http://mensstudies.metapress.com/content/j24001m18032108j/|author=Enid Bloch |publisher=Men's Studies Press |volume= 9,Number 2 / Winter 2001 |pages=183–204 |date=March 21, 2007|doi=10.3149/jms.0902.183|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other vases show the boy running away.&lt;ref&gt;"For this lust is not entirely free of violence, and there can be something slightly frightening about it (after all, the boy in Ill. 19 is running away)" Glenn W. Most "The Athlete's Body in Ancient Greece" in ''Stanford Humanities Review'' V.6.2 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic controversy==

An unofficial ban of talking about pederasty in academia was broken only in 1905 by the German historian Erich Bethe with his study ''Dorian Boy-Love: Its Ethic, Its Idea.''&lt;ref&gt;Georges Dumézil, Preface in ''Homosexuality in Greek Myth'' by Bernard Sergent, Boston, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, {{citation needed span|text=as late as 2005,|date=June 2015}} Haworth Press withdrew from publication a volume on homosexuality in classical antiquity titled ''Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition of the West.'' This was in response to criticism from "certain sectors" that objected a line in the abstract of the academic [[Bruce Rind]]'s [[Rind et al. controversy|controversial paper]], which they said advocated [[pedophilia]].&lt;ref name="VerstraeteProvencal2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Beerte C. Verstraete|author2=Vernon L. Provencal|title=Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition of the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GJJ9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP11|date=1 May 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-95337-1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publisher, in a letter to the editors, attempted to exonerate Rind from the accusation and conceded that the article was sound, but stood by his decision to withdraw it "to avoid negative press" and "economic repercussions."&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Rutz, vice president for editorial development at Haworth, said in an e-mail message that the press had received about 20 e-mail messages in the 24–36 hours after the WorldNetDaily article appeared, and that the flurry of messages prompted a "vigorous" discussion among the press' top officials.
	 	 	
"Issues on the table," she said, "included freedom of speech, consequences of negative publicity, personal objections to the subject matter, and resistance to what might appear to be caving in to a particular group with its own right-wing agenda."

Ultimately, Rutz said, the decision to cancel the book was based on the fact that "the final article by Bruce Rind is construed by some as being sympathetic to pederasty,” which she emphasized that the press does not "in any way support or endorse."
	 	
Rutz said the decision "can on one level be considered a business decision. Our customer base is large and the number of disciplines we cover is large. Because 95 percent of our customers would likely be opposed to anything even remotely construed as sexual abuse apologetics, publishing this paper would be a bad business decision.""Doug Lederman,"Pressure Prompts Publisher to Punt," in ''Inside Higher Ed'' Sept. 27,2005 [http://insidehighered.com/news/2005/09/27/publish]&lt;/ref&gt; Later Haworth reversed course and announced that the book and journal would be published, but without Rind's controversial essay. Mr. Rind's essay is to be published in a future "supplementary volume" of ''The Journal of Homosexuality'', together with counterarguments advanced by his critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Glenn|first1=David|title=Book on Homosexuality in Antiquity and Essay on Pederasty Will Be Printed After All, Publisher Says|url=http://chronicle.com/daily/2005/10/2005101202n.htm|website=chronicle.com|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=19 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110024722/http://chronicle.com/daily/2005/10/2005101202n.htm |archivedate=January 10, 2009 |date=26 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was originally suggested by [[Ben Hammersley]] as a [[portmanteau]] of "[[iPod]]" (a brand of [[portable media player|media player]]) and "[[broadcast]]".&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/podcast |title=Definition of podcast in English |website=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=padding&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p038m811|title=The man who accidentally invented the word 'podcast' |last=Sawyer |first=Miranda |authorlink=Miranda Sawyer |date=November 20, 2015 |website=[[BBC Radio 4]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017|format=MP3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The files distributed are in audio format, but may sometimes include other file formats such as [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] or [[EPUB]]. Videos which are shared following a podcast model are sometimes called [[Podcast#Video podcasts|video podcasts]] or vodcasts.

The generator of a podcast maintains a central list of the files on a [[server (computing)|server]] as a [[web feed]] that can be accessed through the [[Internet]]. The listener or viewer uses special [[client (computing)|client]] [[application software|application]] [[software]] on a computer or media player, known as a [[List of podcatchers|podcatcher]], which accesses this web feed, checks it for updates, and downloads any new files in the series. This process can be automated to download new files automatically, which may seem to users as though new episodes are broadcast or "[[Push technology|pushed]]" to them. Files are stored locally on the user's device, ready for [[Online and offline|offline]] use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k1967&amp;pageid=icb.page23750 |title=Podcast Production |website=[[Harvard Graduate School of Education]] |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710232048/http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k1967&amp;pageid=icb.page23750 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 10, 2012 |quote=...&amp;nbsp;This code enables specially designed software to locate and track new versions or episodes of a particular podcast&amp;nbsp;... |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different mobile applications available for people to use to subscribe and to listen to podcasts. Many of these applications allow users to download podcasts or to stream them on demand as an alternative to downloading. Many podcast players (apps as well as dedicated devices) allow listeners to skip around the podcast and control the playback speed.

Some have labeled podcasting as a [[Technological convergence|converged medium]] bringing together audio, [[World Wide Web|the web]], and [[portable media player]]s, as well as a [[Disruptive innovation|disruptive technology]] that has caused some individuals in the radio business to reconsider established practices and preconceptions about audiences, consumption, production, and distribution.&lt;ref name="Willipod"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berry |first=Richard |date=May 1, 2006 |title=Will the iPod Kill the Radio Star?

Podcasts are usually free of charge to listeners and can often be created for little to no cost, which sets them apart from the traditional model of "[[Gatekeeper|gate-kept]]" media and production tools. Podcast creators can monetize their podcasts by allowing companies to purchase [[advertising|ad]] time, as well as via sites such as [[Patreon]], which provides special extras and content to listeners for a fee. Podcasting is very much a [[Horizontalidad|horizontal]] media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freshminds.net/2011/07/horizontal-media-how-social-media-has-changed-journalism/ |title='Horizontal media' - how social media has changed journalism |last=Stratmann |first=Jo |date=July 20, 2011 |website=[[FreshMinds]] |accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; form – producers are consumers, consumers may become producers, and both can engage in conversations with each other.&lt;ref name="Willipod" /&gt;

==Name==
"Podcast" is a [[portmanteau]] word, formed by combining "[[iPod]]" and "[[Broadcasting|broadcast]]".&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; The term "podcasting" as a name for the nascent technology was first suggested by [[The Guardian]] columnist and [[BBC]] journalist [[Ben Hammersley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/feb/12/broadcasting.digitalmedia |title=Why online radio is booming |last=Hammersley |first=Ben  |authorlink=Ben Hammersley |date=February 12, 2004 |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who invented it in early February 2004 while "[[wikt:pad out|padding out]]" an article for The Guardian newspaper.&lt;ref name= padding/&gt; Despite the etymology, the content can be accessed using any computer or similar device that can play media files. Use of the term "podcast" predated Apple's addition of formal support for podcasting to the iPod, or its [[iTunes]] software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4631051.stm |title=Apple brings podcasts into iTunes |date=June 28, 2005 |website=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other names for podcasting include "net cast", intended as a vendor-neutral term without the loose reference to the Apple iPod. This name is used by shows from the [[TWiT.tv]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.twit.tv/wiki/FAQ |title=FAQ - The Official TWiT Wiki |website=[[TWiT.tv]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources have also suggested the [[backronym]] "portable on demand" or "POD", for similar reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows-vista/create-your-own-podcast-what-you-need-to-know-to-be-a-podcaster |title=Create your own podcast: What you need to know to be a podcaster |website=[[Microsoft Windows]] |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225095312/http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows-vista/create-your-own-podcast-what-you-need-to-know-to-be-a-podcaster |archivedate=2015-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of podcasting}}

Former [[MTV]] [[VJ (media personality)|video jockey]] [[Adam Curry]], in collaboration with [[Dave Winer]] – co-author of the [[RSS]] specification – is credited with coming up with the idea to automate the delivery and syncing of textual content to portable audio players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/21/entertainment/ca-podfather21 |title='Podfather' plots a radio hit of his own |last=Miller |first=Martin |date=May 21, 2006 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Origins"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.voices.com/resources/articles/podcasting/history-of-podcasting |title=The Origins of Podcasting |last=Ciccarelli |first=Stephanie |date=April 4, 2015 |website=[[Voices.com]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Podcasting History"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/podcasting1.htm |title=How Podcasting Works § Podcasting History |last=Watson |first=Stephanie |date=March 26, 2005 |website=[[HowStuffWorks]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Podcasting, once an obscure method of spreading information, has become a recognized medium for distributing audio content, whether for corporate or personal use. Podcasts are similar to [[radio program]]s, but they are audio files. Listeners can play them at their convenience, using devices that have become more common than portable broadcast receivers.

The first application to make this process feasible was iPodderX, developed by August Trometer and Ray Slakinski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redorbit.com/education/reference_library/technology_1/internet/1112804661/podcast/ |title=Podcast |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130630060559/http://www.redorbit.com/education/reference_library/technology_1/internet/1112804661/podcast/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 30, 2013 |website=redOrbit |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, audio podcasts were doing what was historically accomplished via radio broadcasts, which had been the source of radio [[Talk radio|talk shows]] and [[All-news radio|news programs]] since the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Podcasting History" /&gt; This shift occurred as a result of the evolution of internet capabilities along with increased consumer access to cheaper hardware and software for audio recording and editing.

In October 2003, Matt Schichter launched his weekly chat show ''The BackStage Pass''. [[B.B. King]], [[Third Eye Blind]], [[Gavin DeGraw]], [[The Beach Boys]], and [[Jason Mraz]] were notable guests the first season. The hour long radio show was recorded live, transcoded to 16kbit/s audio for dial-up online streaming. Despite a lack of a commonly accepted identifying name for the medium at the time of its creation, ''The Backstage Pass'' which became known as ''Matt Schichter Interviews''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/matt-schichter-interviews/id1110551911?mt=2|title=Matt Schichter Interviews by Scared Goose Productions on Apple Podcasts|website=Apple Podcasts|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly believed to be the first podcast to be published online.

In August 2004, Adam Curry launched his show ''[[Daily Source Code]]''. It was a show focused on chronicling his everyday life, delivering news, and discussions about the development of podcasting, as well as promoting new and emerging podcasts. Curry published it in an attempt to gain traction in the development of what would come to be known as podcasting and as a means of testing the software outside of a lab setting. The name ''Daily Source Code'' was chosen in the hope that it would attract an audience with an interest in technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Geoghegan |first1=Michael W.|last2=Klass |first2=Dan |date=November 4, 2007 |title=Podcast Solutions: The Complete Guide to Audio and Video Podcasting |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WkAzn9TfL9gC&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage |publisher=[[Apress]] |location=New York |isbn=978-1-59059-905-1 |page=4 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Daily Source Code'' started at a grassroots level of production and was initially directed at podcast developers. As its audience became interested in the format, these developers were inspired to create and produce their own projects and, as a result, they improved the code used to create podcasts. As more people learned how easy it was to produce podcasts, a community of pioneer podcasters quickly appeared.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;

In June 2005, [[Apple Inc|Apple]] released [[iTunes]] 4.9 which added formal support for podcasts, thus negating the need to use a separate program in order to download and transfer them to a mobile device. While this made access to podcasts more convenient and widespread, it also effectively ended advancement of podcatchers by independent developers. Additionally, Apple issued [[cease and desist]] orders to many podcast application developers and service providers for using the term "iPod" or "Pod" in their products' names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/09/24/with-pod-on-lockdown-apple-goes-after-podcast/ |title=With "pod" on lockdown, Apple goes after "podcast" |last=Blass |first=Evan |date=September 24, 2006 |website=[[Engadget]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Podcasting icon.svg|thumb|The logo used by Apple to represent podcasting in its iTunes software.]]

Within a year, many podcasts from public radio networks like the [[BBC]], [[CBC Radio One]], [[NPR]], and [[Public Radio International]] placed many of their radio shows on the iTunes platform. In addition, major local radio stations like [[WNYC]] in New York City and [[WHYY-FM]] radio in Philadelphia, [[KCRW]] in Los Angeles placed their programs on their websites and later on the iTunes platform.

Concurrently, [[CNET]], ''[[This Week in Tech]]'', and later [[Bloomberg Radio]], the ''[[Financial Times]]'', and other for-profit companies provided podcast content, some using podcasting as their only distribution system.

===IP issues in trademark and patent law===
====Trademark applications====
Between February 10 and 25 March 2005, Shae Spencer Management, LLC of [[Fairport, New York]] filed a trademark application to register the term "podcast" for an "online prerecorded radio program over the internet". On September 9, 2005, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) rejected the application, citing [[Wikipedia]]'s podcast entry as describing the history of the term. The company amended their application in March 2006, but the USPTO rejected the amended application as not sufficiently differentiated from the original. In November 2006, the application was marked as abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=78564869&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=documentSearch |title=Podcast trademark rejection documents |website=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office|USPTO]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 20, 2005, known trademarks that attempted to capitalize on podcast included: ePodcast, GodCast, GuidePod, MyPod, Pod-Casting, Podango, PodCabin, Podcast, Podcast Realty, Podcaster, PodcastPeople, Podgram PodKitchen, PodShop, and Podvertiser.&lt;ref name="Podcasting History" /&gt;

By February 2007, there had been 24 attempts to register trademarks containing the word "PODCAST" in the United States, but only "PODCAST READY" from ''Podcast Ready, Inc.'' was approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?state=4810:al4odh.4.1&amp;f=toc&amp;a_search=&amp;p_s_ALL=PODCAST |title=List of US podcast trademarks |website=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office|USPTO]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apple trademark protections====
On September 26, 2004, it was reported that [[Apple Inc.]] had started to crack down on businesses using the string "POD", in product and company names. Apple sent a [[cease and desist]] letter that week to Podcast Ready, Inc., which markets an application known as "myPodder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.podcastready.com/info.php?section=8&amp;page=41 |title=Podcast Ready Receives Cease &amp; Desist from Apple Computer |last=Holliman |first=Russell |date=September 26, 2006 |website=Podcast Ready |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005015828/http://www.podcastready.com/info.php?section=8&amp;page=41 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers for Apple contended that the term "pod" has been used by the public to refer to Apple's music player so extensively that it falls under Apple's trademark cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2343732,00.asp |title=Apple's Legal Team Going After 'Pod' People |last=Heater |first=Brian |date=March 24, 2009 |website=[[PC Magazine]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such activity was speculated to be part of a bigger campaign for Apple to expand the scope of its existing [[iPod]] trademark, which included trademarking "IPOD", "IPODCAST", and "POD".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2006/09/25/podcast-trademark-controversy/ |title=Podcast Trademark Controversy |last=Longo |first=Jeffrey |date=September 25, 2006 |website=[[MacRumors]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 16, 2006, the Apple Trademark Department stated that "Apple does not object to third-party usage of the generic term 'podcast' to accurately refer to podcasting services" and that "Apple does not license the term". However, no statement was made as to whether or not Apple believed they held rights to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/theglobalgeekpodcast/309396084/sizes/l/ |title=Copy of the letter from Apple Trademark Department |author=Global Geek Podcast |website=[[Flickr]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personal Audio lawsuits====
[[Personal Audio LLC (patent holding company)|Personal Audio]], a company referred to as a "[[patent troll]]" by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]],&lt;ref name="EFF"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/help-save-podcasting |title=Help Save Podcasting! |last=Nazer |first=Daniel |date=May 30, 2013 |website=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; filed a patent on podcasting in 2009 for a claimed invention in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/patents/US8112504 |title=System for disseminating media content representing episodes in a serialized sequence |website=[[Google Patents]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, Personal Audio started suing high-profile podcasters for royalties,&lt;ref name="EFF" /&gt; including ''[[The Adam Carolla Show (podcast)|The Adam Carolla Show]]'' and the ''[[HowStuffWorks]]'' podcast. US Congressman [[Peter DeFazio]]'s previously proposed "SHIELD Act" intended to curb patent trolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/02/podcasting-community-faces-patent-troll-threat-eff-wants-help |title=Podcasting Community Faces Patent Troll Threat; EFF Wants to Help |last=Samuels |first=Julie |date=February 5, 2013 |website=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017 |quote=Personal Audio is claiming that it owns a patent that covers podcasting technology.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] filed a petition with the US Trademark Office to invalidate the Personal Audio patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/cases/eff-v-personal-audio-llc |title=EFF v. Personal Audio LLC |website=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 2014, the Electronic Frontier Foundation announced that Adam Carolla had settled with Personal Audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/08/good-bad-and-ugly-adam-carollas-settlement-podcasting-troll |title=The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Adam Carolla’s Settlement with the Podcasting Troll |last=Nazer |first=Daniel |date=August 18, 2014 |website=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10, 2015, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office invalidated five provisions of Personal Audio's podcasting patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/04/10/how-the-government-just-protected-your-favorite-podcasts/ |title=How the government just protected some of your favorite podcasts |last=Fung |first=Brian |date=April 10, 2015 |website=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
===Enhanced podcasts===
An '''enhanced podcast''' can display images synchronized with audio. These can contain chapter markers, [[hyperlink]]s, and artwork, all of which is synced to a specific program or device. When an enhanced podcast is played within its specific program or device, all the appropriate information should be displayed at the same time and in the same window, making it easier to display materials.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Podcast novels===
A '''podcast novel''' (also known as a '''serialized audiobook''' or '''podcast audiobook''') is a [[Literature|literary]] format that combines the concepts of a podcast and an [[audiobook]]. Like a traditional [[novel]], a podcast novel is a work of long literary fiction; however, this form of the novel is recorded into episodes that are delivered online over a period of time and in the end available as a complete work for download. The episodes may be delivered automatically via [[RSS]], through a website, blog, or another syndication method. These files are either listened to directly on a user's computer or loaded onto a portable media device to be listened to later.

The types of novels that are podcasted vary from new works from new authors that have never been [[Printing|printed]],&lt;ref name="myb"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ki0pE7i7FM |title=Marketing your book in the internet age |author=Creative Choices |date=August 6, 2009 |website=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aftv"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/01/books/01podb.html |title=Authors Find Their Voice, and Audience, in Podcasts |last=Newman |first=Andrew Adam |date=March 1, 2007 |website=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to well-established authors that have been around for years,{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} to classic works of literature that have been in print for over a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4532526.stm |title=Christmas Carol gets free podcast |date=December 15, 2005 |website=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://librivox.org/short-story-collection-001/ |title=Short Story Collection Vol. 001 |website=[[LibriVox]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same style as an audiobook, podcast novels may be elaborately narrated with separate voice actors for each character and sound effects, similar to a [[Radio drama|radio play]]. Other podcast novels have a single narrator reading the text of the story with little or no sound effects.

Podcast novels are distributed over the [[Internet]], commonly on a [[Blog|weblog]]. Podcast novels are released in episodes on a regular schedule (e.g., once a week) or irregularly as each episode is released when completed. They can either be downloaded manually from a website or blog or be delivered automatically via [[RSS]] or another method of syndication.  Ultimately, a serialized podcast novel becomes a completed [[audiobook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1872381,00.html |title=Podcasting Your Novel: Publishing's Next Wave? |last=Florin |first=Hector |date=January 31, 2009 |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some podcast novelists give away a free podcast version of their book as a form of promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Take-my-book-It-s-free-3288454.php |title=Take my book. It's free |last=Cadelago |first=Chris |date=April 5, 2008 |website=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some such novelists have even secured publishing contracts to have their novels printed.&lt;ref name="myb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aftv" /&gt; Podcast novelists have commented that podcasting their novels lets them build audiences even if they cannot get a publisher to buy their books. These audiences then make it easier to secure a printing deal with a publisher at a later date. These podcast novelists also claim the exposure that releasing a free podcast gains them makes up for the fact that they are giving away their work for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/09/05/free-really-can-make-you-money-a-dialogue-with-moses-siregar-iii/ |title="Free" Really Can Make You Money – A Dialogue With Moses Siregar III |last=Gaughran |first=David |date=September 5, 2011  |website=Let’s Get Digital |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video podcasts===
[[File:The Crab Nebula NASA.ogv|thumb|A video podcast on the [[Crab Nebula]] by [[NASA]]]]

A '''video podcast''' (sometimes shortened to "'''vodcast'''") includes [[video clip]]s. [[Web television]] series are often distributed as video podcasts.

''[[Dead End Days]]'' (2003–2004) is commonly believed to be the first video podcast. That serialized [[Black comedy|dark comedy]] about zombies was broadcast from 31 October 2003 through 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-video-podcast.htm |title=What is a Video Podcast? |website=wiseGEEK |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the spread of the [[Internet]] and the use of Internet broadband connection [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]], which helps to identify various applications, a faster connection to the Internet has been created and a wide amount of communication has been created. Video podcasts have become extremely popular online and are often presented as short video clips, usually excerpts of a longer recording. Video clips are being used on pre-established websites, and increasing numbers of websites are being created solely for the purpose of hosting video clips and podcasts. Video podcasts are being streamed on intranets and extranets, and private and public networks, and are taking communication through the Internet to new levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.inxpo.com/from-association-meetings-to-corporate-events-video-is-everywhere/ |title=From Association Meetings to Corporate Events, Video is Everywhere |last=Shiao |first=Dennis |date=March 17, 2011 |website=INXPO |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most video clips are now submitted and produced by individuals.{{Nonspecific|date=December 2012}} Video podcasts are also being used for web television, commonly referred to as Web TV, a rapidly growing genre of digital entertainment that uses various forms of [[new media]] to deliver to an audience both reruns of shows or series and content created or delivered originally online via broadband and mobile networks, web television shows, or web series. Examples include [[Amazon Video]], [[Hulu]], and [[Netflix]].  Other types of video podcasts used for web television may be short-form, anywhere from 2–9 minutes per episode, typically used for advertising, video blogs, amateur filming, journalism, and convergence with traditional media.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Video podcasting is also helping build businesses, especially in the sales and marketing sectors. Through video podcasts, businesses both large and small can advertise their wares and services in a modern, cost-effective way. In the past, big businesses had better access to expensive studios where sophisticated advertisements were produced, but now even the smallest businesses can create high-quality media with just a camera, editing software, and the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/podcasting4.htm |title=How Podcasting Works § Video Podcasts |last=Watson |first=Stephanie |date=March 26, 2005 |website=[[HowStuffWorks]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a two-year study, 2012-2013, conducted by a South African university a question was raised; over the years of podcast development, is podcasting socially inclusive. The results of this study concluded with minor quarks, podcasting is socially inclusive.&lt;ref name="Golden Age"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berry |first=Richard |date=November 2015 |title=A Golden Age of Podcasting?

===Oggcast===
An '''oggcast''' is a podcast recorded and distributed exclusively in the [[Vorbis]] audio codec with the [[Ogg]] [[Digital container format|container format]], and/or other similarly free codecs/formats.&lt;ref name="Djere"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://djere.com/node/183 |title=The Definition of An Oggcast |last=Djere |first=Rex |date=December 25, 2011 |website=Djere |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426072050/https://djere.com/node/183 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a podcast distributed both in the non-free [[MP3]] format and the free [[Ogg]] format would not technically meet the definition of an oggcast. In contrast, a podcast distributed in both the Vorbis and [[Speex]] codecs would meet the strict definition of an oggcast. The term oggcast is a combination of the word "ogg" from the term [[Ogg Vorbis]], and the syllable "cast", from "[[Broadcasting|broadcast]]".

The term was coined for the fifth season of the ''Gnu World Order'' by [[Klaatu (podcaster)|Klaatu]] in 2010, when the show declared itself "the world's first oggcast".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnuworldorder.info/audiophile/archive/season5/index5.html |title=The Bad Apples - The World's First OGGcast! |website=Gnu World Order |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, the show was one of the few that released only in free formats, with no MP3 feed as an option. This gave way to other shows using the term, with hosts gathering in the {{Freenode|oggcastplanet}} [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] channel on the [[Freenode]] network to compare notes.

''[[The Linux Link Tech Show]]'', one of the longer running Linux podcasts still in production, has a program in the Ogg Vorbis format in its archives from January 7, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tlltsarchive.org/archives/tllts_14-01-07-04.ogg |title=The Linux Link Tech Show |last=Washko |first=Dann |last2=Fessenden |first2=Linc |date=January 7, 2004 |website=TLLTS Archive |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oggcasters tend to be broadcasters who prefer not to use audio and video codecs that have patent and/or licensing restrictions, such as the [[MP3]] codec.&lt;ref name="Djere" /&gt;

Recording and distributing podcasts in the Ogg Vorbis audio format has advantages. [[Mozilla]] [[Firefox]] and [[Google Chrome]] web browsers both support playing Vorbis files directly in the browser without requiring plugins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Mozilla-Firefox-3-1-on-It-039-s-Way-to-Setting-Web-Video-Standard-91432.shtml |title=Mozilla Firefox 3.1 on Its Way to Setting Web Video Standard |last=Constantin |first=Lucian |date=August 5, 2008 |website=[[Softpedia]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-chrome-gets-html-video-support/ |title=Google Chrome gets HTML video support |last=Shankland |first=Stephen |date=May 28, 2009 |website=[[CNET]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vorbis may produce better audio quality with a smaller file size than alternative codecs such as [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] or MP3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eskimo.com/~nanook/knowledge/oggvorbis.html |title=Ogg Vorbis - An Alternative to MP3 |website=Eskimo |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040202172710/http://www.eskimo.com/~nanook/knowledge/oggvorbis.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this has not been proven conclusively. Ogg Vorbis is not bound by patents and is considered "free software" in the sense that no corporate entity owns the rights to the format. Some people feel that this is a safer container for their multimedia content for this reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/playogg/en/ |title=PlayOgg! |website=[[Free Software Foundation]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, oggcasters can generally not reach as wide of an audience as more traditional podcasters. This is mainly due to the lack of native Ogg Vorbis support in [[Microsoft]]'s [[Internet Explorer]] and Apple's [[Safari web browser]], and the lack of Ogg Vorbis support in many mobile audio devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wewantogg.com/ |title=Ogg Vorbis Support for Internet Explorer and Safari |website=We Want Ogg |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120918203524/http://www.wewantogg.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political podcast===
{{Further|Political podcast}}

A '''political podcast''' focuses on current events, lasts usually a half hour to an hour, often with a relaxed and conversational tone, and features journalists and politicians and pollsters and writers and others with credentials in the [[public sphere]]. Most political podcasts have a host-guest interview format and are broadcast each week based on the news cycle. Political podcasts have blossomed in the past few years in the [[United States]] because of the long election cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/07/conservative-podcasts-ricochet/ |title=You Heard Right: Conservatives Get Their Very Own Podcast Network |last=Locke |first=Charley |date=July 6, 2016 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017 |quote= ...&amp;nbsp;this election cycle is bringing listeners an unprecedented spate of opinionated incredulity.

===Podguide===
A '''podguide''' is an enhanced [[audio tour]] podcast.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} It is a single [[audio file]] where each chapter displays a picture and a number of what to look at a certain stopover. The numbers correspond to the numbers on a map that can be downloaded via the link incorporated into the artwork of the chapters in the podguide. Podguides are in the [[m4a]] format and can only be listened to through [[iTunes]] or an [[iPod]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} It is like a soundseeing tour but with pictures and a map, so users can take the tour themselves.

==Uses==
{{Main|Uses of podcasting}}

Communities use collaborative podcasts to support multiple contributors podcasting through generally simplified processes, and without having to host their own individual feeds. A community podcast can also allow members of the community (related to the podcast topic) to contribute to the podcast in many different ways. This method was first used for a series of podcasts hosted by the Regional Educational Technology Center at [[Fordham University]] in 2005.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} [[Anders Gronstedt]] explores how businesses like [[IBM]] and [[Dell EMC|EMC]] use podcasts as an employee training and communication channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gronstedt |first=Anders |date=June 2007 |title=Employees Get an Earful |url=https://hbr.org/2007/06/employees-get-an-earful |journal=[[Harvard Business Review]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gronstedt |first=Anders |date=May 3, 2007 |title=Basics of Podcasting |url=http://gronstedtgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Infoline_Gronstedt_Basics_of_Podcasting.pdf |publisher=[[Association for Talent Development|ASTD]] |isbn=1-56286-488-2 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The podcast industry is very profitable. Over 50 million people listen to podcasts each month. A small, yet efficient number of listeners are also podcast creators. Creating a podcast is reasonably inexpensive. It requires just a microphone, laptop or other personal computer, and a room with some sound blocking. Podcast creators tend to have a good listener base because of their relationships with the listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Smith |first=Steve |date=November 22, 2016 |title=Podcasts: Can They Hear Us Now |url=http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/Column/Follow-the-Money/Podcasts-Can-They-Hear-Us-Now-114172.htm |magazine=EContent |publisher=[[Information Today, Inc.]] |volume=39 |issue=8 |page=9 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23370">'''Public interest law''' loosely, refers to legal practices undertaken to help poor or marginalized people, or to effect change in social policies in the public interest, on 'not for profit' terms ([[pro bono|''pro bono publico'']]). In general terms it means a legal action initiated in the court of law for the protection of Public Interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learningthelaw.in/2016/07/nature-and-importance-of-public.html Nature and Importance of Public Interest Litigation], available at Learning the Law.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not a body of law or a legal field, matters lawyers work on. Rather, it denotes the clientele they represent. Instead of serving powerful economic interests, it stands for the advocacy of otherwise under-represented or vulnerable individuals, especially those living in poverty. It has grown to encompass a broader range of activities, typically the field of non-lawyers like civil rights, civil liberties, women's rights, consumer rights, environmental protection, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forster|first1=Christine M. (University of New South Wales, Sydney)|last2=Jivan|first2=Vedna (University of Technology Sydney, Sydney)|title=Public Interest Litigation and Human Rights Implementation: The Indian and Australian Experience|url=https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/research/bitstream/handle/10453/10475/2007005097OK.pdf#page=4|page=3|journal=Asian Journal of Comparative Law|publisher=The Berkeley Electronic Press|year=2008|accessdate=8 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210072159/https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/research/bitstream/handle/10453/10475/2007005097OK.pdf#page=4|archivedate=10 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a common ethic for public-interest lawyers in a growing number of countries remains “fighting for the little guy”.&lt;ref name=Cummings&gt;Scott L. Cummings &amp; Ingrid V. Eagly, After Public Interest Law, NWU L. Rev. 1251, 1251-1259, 2075-2077(2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central and Eastern Europe ==
At the end of the communist period in the early 1990s, the national legal systems of Central and Eastern Europe were still in a formative stage. The most important source of legal authority for the new human rights groups came from outside the region: the [[Council of Europe]], with its [[European Convention on Human Rights]], and the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=Rekosh&gt;Edwin Rekosh, Constructing Public Interest Law: Transnational Collaboration and Exchange in Central and Eastern Europe, 13 UCLA J. Int'l L.&amp; For. Aff.55, 80-82&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, in the mid-1990s, U.S. experiences became more relevant. The Council of Europe's prerequisite that lawyers use their own country's courts first to seek legal remedies before turning to the European bodies gradually became more than a pro forma exercise, and civil society organizations began to make more effective use of domestic means of adjudication. But by the time local activists were ready to consider the utility of [[impact litigation]], test cases, and other tactics familiar from the U.S. experience, they already understood that their ultimate tactical weapon in any piece of litigation was to use the threat or reality of a supportive decision at the European Court of Human Rights. With this background in mind, it made more sense for the promoters of public interest law in Central and Eastern Europe to talk about "strategic litigation" than about public interest litigation. Using the instrumentality of the European Court of Human Rights effectively required a strategic approach. Not all human rights cases were likely to receive a favorable ruling; a negative ruling could produce more damage to the human rights cause than no ruling at all. The European Court had a rich case law that could provide clues to how a future case might be decided, and there were procedural aspects, such as the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies, to consider.

The core lesson from the U.S. experience for local activists was how courts could be used effectively as a tool for civil society engagement in governance.&lt;ref name=Rekosh /&gt;
== Italy ==
The changes to the Italian electoral law from 2014 to 2017 were both "caused by actions born from the bottom (...) the result of a methodical, studied and concerted action. It has been featured by university professors, constitutional and electoral law-makers, parliamentarians and other elected representatives (...), representatives of civil society and ordinary citizens. Their names are, as voters, in more than twenty introductory pleadings (quotations or appeals)"&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://www.nomos-leattualitaneldiritto.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/maestri-2.pdf Gabriele Maestri, ''ORIZZONTI DI TECNICA ELETTORALE: PROBLEMI SUPERATI, IRRISOLTI ED EMERSI ALLA LUCE DELLA SENTENZA N. 35 DEL 2017'', Nomos, n. 2/2017].&lt;/ref&gt;, all of them brought [[pro bono]].

==China==
Public interest law (公益法, pronounced Gong Yi Fa) is an accepted term in China, where the basic institutions supporting the rule of law are still extremely nascent. China does not have a common-law system in which lawyers are expected to play a key role in “making law.”  Nevertheless, a small but effective community of lawyers has gained acceptance of public interest litigation as a legitimate means of resolving social issues and contributing to a harmonious society, and non-governmental actors have significantly improved the enforcement of rights for migrant workers, women, children and those suffering from environmental degradation, among others. For example, public interest lawyers in China have filed lawsuits in court successfully challenging workplace sexual harassment and the involuntary confinement of healthy people to mental hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional-Executive Commission on China, 2011 Annual Report, Parts II and III (October 10, 2011), available at {{cite web |url=http://www.cecc.gov/pages/annualRpt/annualRpt11/AR2011final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213223223/http://www.cecc.gov/pages/annualRpt/annualRpt11/AR2011final.pdf |archivedate=2013-02-13 |df= }}; see generally R.P. Peerenboom, China's Long March toward Rule of Law (Cambridge University Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese reformers believe that one avenue for speeding the development of public interest law is implementing an associational standing rule by which organizations can instigate lawsuits to protect the interests of its members. Currently, China’s Civil Procedure Law is undergoing revision. One of the proposed amendments would create a form of associational standing. In theory, the new law would give domestic NGOs the power to file lawsuits in their own name on behalf of their members, but the proposed amendment has engendered spirited debate and its fate is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Draft limits scale of class-action lawsuits|work= [[China Daily]]|date= April 24, 2012|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-04/25/content_15131945.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hong Kong==
{{main|Public interest law in Hong Kong}}
In Hong Kong public interest law is an emerging field. The chief vehicle for pursuing public interest claims is judicial review. This is the process by which decisions of the government are challenged in the courts. There has been a surge in judicial review cases since 2000. Environmental issues&lt;ref&gt;See for example, [http://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/2004/27.html?stem=&amp;synonyms=&amp;query=title(Society%20for%20Protection%20of%20the%20Harbour%20Ltd%20and%20Town%20Planning%20Board) Society for Protection of the Harbour Ltd v Town Planning Board] [2004] 1 HKLRD 396; [http://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2007/757.html?stem=&amp;synonyms=&amp;query=Clean%20Air%20Foundation%20Ltd Clean Air Foundation Ltd v The Government of the HKSAR] [2007] HKEC 1356.&lt;/ref&gt; and minority rights&lt;ref&gt;See for example, [http://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/2013/39.html?stem=&amp;synonyms=&amp;query=title(W%20and%20Registrar%20of%20Marriages) W v Registrar of Marriages] [2013] HKCFA 39; [http://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/2013/17.html?stem=&amp;synonyms=&amp;query=Vallejos%20Evangeline%20Banao Vallejos Evangeline Banao v Commissioner of Registration &amp; Anor] [2013] HKCFA 17.&lt;/ref&gt; are among the most litigated areas.

One of the pioneers in public interest law in Hong Kong was Pamela Baker. In the late 1980s she litigated a series of landmark courtroom cases challenging the government’s treatment of Vietnamese refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Geoffrey. [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/apr/27/guardianobituaries ''"Pam Baker"''], ''"[[The Guardian]]"'', Saturday 27 April 2002. Retrieved 4 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the [[Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor]] was established with the aim of promoting better human rights protection in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkhrm.org.hk|title=基本法第廿三條|website=www.hkhrm.org.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the majority of [[Cause lawyering | cause lawyers]] who represent citizens and social groups in human rights and public policy litigation on a consistent basis in Hong Kong are also members of political parties or active participants in social movements outside the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Tam, Waikeung. ''"Political Transition and the Rise of Cause lawyering: The Case of Hong Kong"'' 3 [2010] 35 Law &amp; Social Inquiry 663, 664.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hong Kong, the [[Legal Aid Department]] provides funding to legal services for those who pass the means and merits test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lad.gov.hk/eng/las/overview.html|title=Legal Aid Department - Legal Aid Schemes - Overview|website=www.lad.gov.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two Legal Aid Schemes that it operates, namely the Ordinary Legal Aid Scheme (OLAS) and the Supplementary Legal Aid Scheme (SLAS) have facilitated the practice of public interest law through narrowing the resource inequality between economically disadvantaged litigants and the government.&lt;ref&gt;Tam, Waikeung. ''"Political Transition and the Rise of Cause Lawyering: The Case of Hong Kong"'' 3 [2010] 35 Law &amp; Social Inquiry 663, 673.&lt;/ref&gt; However, NGOs and charitable organizations are not eligible to get legal aid.&lt;ref name="karen"&gt;Kong, Karen. "Costs in Public Interest Litigation: Whose Pocket Should be Picked?" 39 HKLJ 767, 768.&lt;/ref&gt; The NGOs and Charitable organizations contributed to opening of avenues for people who deserved justice but lacked interest to approach courts and helped them in becoming petitioners to get justice.

Apart from legal aid, the [[Hong Kong Bar Association]] and [[The Law Society of Hong Kong]] jointly provides the Duty Lawyer Scheme which offers free legal representation to eligible defendants on the first day of court appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutylawyer.org.hk/en/duty/duty.asp|title=The Duty Lawyer Service : Duty Lawyer Scheme : The Duty Lawyer Scheme|website=www.dutylawyer.org.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also run the Free Legal Advice Scheme at their Legal Advice Centres within nine District Offices in Hong Kong with the aim to provide one-off preliminary legal advice to the general public without imposing any means test.&lt;ref name="duty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutylawyer.org.hk/en/free/free.asp|title=The Duty Lawyer Service : Free Legal Advice Scheme : Free Legal Advice Scheme|website=www.dutylawyer.org.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hong Kong Bar Association and The Law Society of Hong Kong operate their own Bar Free Legal Service Scheme&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkba.org/the-bar/free-legal-service/ archived] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407073406/http://www.hkba.org/the-bar/free-legal-service/ |date=2014-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Free Legal Consultation Scheme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.choosehklawyer.org/en/search_fl_start.asp|title=ChooseHKLawyer|website=www.choosehklawyer.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively where enrolled law firms and barristers specializing in different fields volunteer to give consultations on a pro bono basis.&lt;ref name="chung"&gt;Chung, Eugenie. "Why Hong Kong Needs a Pro Bono Clearinghouse" 40 [2010] HKLJ 719, 731-732.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, unlike in the United States where NGOs and public interest law groups routinely bring public interest lawsuits on behalf of aggrieved individuals, in-house counsel working in NGOs and charities in Hong Kong are not allowed to directly represent the people these organizations serve.&lt;ref&gt;Precht, Robert. [http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1310978/more-public-interest-lawyers-can-help-ease-hong-kongs-social "More public interest lawyers can help ease Hong Kong's social tensions], ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' (17 September 2013). Retrieved 4 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators believe that the inability of NGOs to directly represent clients in legal proceedings has dampened the growth of public interest law in Hong Kong.

Law schools in Hong Kong also organize various programs to promote the idea of ''pro bono'' legal service to students.&lt;ref name="hkuscheme"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ke.hku.hk/eng/highlights/2010/legal|title=KE Spotlight - Community Engagement - HKU Knowledge Exchange|website=www.ke.hku.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro bono committees of law firms in Hong Kong also meet on a bimonthly basis in the Hong Kong Legal Community Roundtable, a forum for international law firms to discuss development of pro bono work in Hong Kong and the region.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer Brown LLP, [http://www.mayerbrown.com/files/Publication/d3066e31-ce28-4bef-8230-0ae6dc5897d2/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/575b4443-1989-4db6-be21-19736d732225/ProBonoUpdate_042010.pdf "Pro Bono Update" (Spring 2010)], page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was introduced in India around 1979-80 by the Supreme Court judges, Justice [[V. R. Krishna Iyer]] along with Justice [[P. N. Bhagwati]]. And since then there had been instances when the Courts are keen to decide the matters of public importance without delay, as the case in Shyam sundar where the court accepted the matter even when the application was made by a letter sent through post.

“Public interest law” is a term that became widely adopted in the United States during and after the social turmoil of the 1960s. It built on a tradition exemplified by [[Louis Brandeis]], who before becoming a U.S. Supreme Court justice incorporated advocacy for the interests of the general public into his legal practice. In a celebrated 1905 speech, Brandeis decried the legal profession, complaining that “able lawyers have to a large extent allowed themselves to become adjuncts of great corporations and have neglected their obligation to use their powers for the protection of the people.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pilnet.org/component/docman/doc_download/35-pursuing-the-public-interest-a-handbook-for-legal.html Edwin Rekosh, et al.,ed. "Pursuing the Public Interest, A Handbook for Legal Professionals and Activists"] (Scott L. Cummings, The Politics of Pro Bono, 52 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 13-14 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s and 1970s, large numbers of American law school graduates began to seek “relevance” in their work—wishing to affect the social issues that were so visibly and hotly debated within American society at that time. They defined themselves as public interest lawyers in order to distinguish themselves from the “corporate adjuncts” referred to by Brandeis.&lt;ref&gt;Rekosh, supra; See also Joel F. Handler, Ellen Jane Hollingsworth &amp; Howard S. Erlanger, Lawyers and the Pursuit of Legal Rights 24-39 (1978); Note, The New Public Interest lawyers, 79 Yale L.J. 1069, 1069-70 (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

Summing up the movement's history in the United States, Stanford University Law Professor Deborah Rhode writes: "Public interest lawyers have saved lives, protected fundamental rights, established crucial principles, transformed institutions, and ensured essential benefits for those who need them most....In virtually every major American social reform movement of the last half century, public interest lawyers have played an important role."&lt;ref&gt;Deborah L.Rhode, Public Interest Law: the Movement and Midlife, 60 Stan.L.Rev. 1, 13-14 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Public interest law is institutionalized in the United States(USA). Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that work to promote and protect human rights using the U.S. legal system, fight to protect the environment, or advocate on behalf of consumers, call themselves public interest law organizations. A large community of lawyers practices public interest law in the form of providing [[legal aid]] free of charge to those who cannot afford to pay for it. However, the grim reality remains that lawyers are underpaid and grossly overworked,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Andrew|title=How Americans Lost the Right to Counsel, 50 Years After 'Gideon' (March, 2013)|url=http://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/how-americans-lost-right-counsel-50-years-after-gideon|publisher=The Brennan Center for Justice (NYU School of Law)|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering perfunctory representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bright|first1=Stephen B.|last2=Sanneh|first2=Sia M.|title=Fifty Years of Defiance and Resistance After Gideon v.

Some law schools have public interest law centers, which advise law students interested in pursuing public interest law careers. [[Pro bono]] programs at bar associations and law firms provide opportunities for commercial lawyers to donate time to public interest law activities.&lt;ref name=Cummings/&gt;

==United Kingdom(UK)==
In law, public interest is a defence against certain lawsuits (for instance some [[libel]] suits in the United Kingdom) and an exemption from certain laws or regulations (for instance [[freedom of information]] laws in the UK). Also, judges in [[common law]] systems can make judgements on the grounds of [[public policy (law)|public policy]], a related term.

'''Public science''' is an increasingly popular term for research that is conducted amongst, or includes, the [[public]]. Two traditions of public science have emerged, one based on [[participatory action research]] and another based on [[science outreach]].

The [[participatory action research]] approach seeks to develop  a critical framework for making systematic inquiry and analysis a public enterprise. It is committed to valuing knowledges that have been historically marginalized and delegitimized (i.e., youth, prisoner, immigrant, farmer) alongside traditionally recognized knowledges (i.e., scholarly). Through the formation of research collectives, it aims to share the various knowledges and resources held by its individual members so members can participate as equally as possible. The choice of appropriate research questions, design, methods and analysis as well as useful research products are decided collectively. Centres for this form of public science include the  [http://publicscienceproject.org/ Public Science Project] and the Society for Participation, Engagement, Action and Knowledge Sharing. 

Examples of public science projects in the [[participatory action research]] tradition include the [http://morrisjustice.org/ Morris Justice Project] and [http://ourfood.org.uk/ Our Food].

The [[science outreach]] approach has some similarities to [[citizen science]] but typically describes projects that are conducted outdoors or in another type of public or accessible space such as a public park, metro stop, library, university campus, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Arcand, K.K., Watzke, M., “Creating Public Science with the From Earth to the Universe Project” Science Communication. September 2011. 33 (3) http://scx.sagepub.com/content/33/3/398.abstract. &lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to [[public art]], there are aspects of collaboration, community support and involvement, and even site specificity&lt;ref&gt;Watzke, M., Arcand, K.K., “The Universe Brought Down to the Streets: The “From Earth to the Universe” Project”. Mercury magazine. Volume 39 #1. Spring 2010.  (excerpt: http://www.astrosociety.org/pubs/mercury/39_02/watzke.html)&lt;/ref&gt; involved.   

Public science efforts in the [[science outreach]] tradition include Science on the Buses, in which city buses in many major European Union cities were decorated with large informational science posters in November 2002.  Likewise, a project in Toronto placed “advertisements” with science facts on [http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/06/busing-in-astronomy/] buses in Toronto during July 2009.

"Science City" is another example of a public science initiative that ran from June 1994 through May 1995. Created by staff and consultants from the New York Hall of Science, "Science City" was an outdoor exhibition that utilized the street, fences, buildings and other public structures in New York City to attract the "non-museum-going" public to the science in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, P.R. &amp; Cutting, J.M., 1996, “The Inside Story of Science City - An Outdoor Public Science Exhibition”. [[Curator: The Museum Journal]]. Volume 39 #4, p.245-261.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition asked questions such as "Why is it warmer in the city?", "What pulses under the street?" and "What's under the sidewalk?" to help increase public awareness about the science and technology that runs invisibly underneath modern urban life. 

[[Science Cafe]]s, founded by the public science pioneer [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/apr/24/duncan-dallas/ Duncan Dallas] are a further public science effort that initiates a discussion on a science topic in pubs or cafes, usually with a local researcher in attendance to answer questions and present information.

[[Science festival]]s can also be grouped into this category of public science efforts, with modern incarnations of festivals including a range of learner-centered activities and events conducted in public spaces. 

Public science initiatives often attempt to reach new audiences (particularly, non-experts who might not actively seek out science), in addition to existing science outreach audiences, by hosting events in alternative [[informal learning]] environments.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, P., Lewenstein, B., Shouse, A. W., Feder, M. A.(Eds). 2009, Learning science in informal environments: People, places and pursuits. Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; By definition, such public science projects are outside the walls of the [[Science museum#Science_center|science center]] or [[science museum]], where the main focus of the particular space is not typically science outreach.&lt;ref&gt;Norsted, B. A., 2010, “Take Me Out to the Ball Game: Science Outreach to Non-traditional Audiences” Science Education and Outreach: Forging a Path to the Future. ASP Conference Series, Vol. 431, p.170-173.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a specific public science initiative in astronomy is “[http://www.fromearthtotheuniverse.org/ From Earth to the Universe]” (FETTU), a project of the [[International Year of Astronomy]] 2009 (IYA2009).&lt;ref&gt;Russo, P. and Christensen, L.L. (Eds.), 2010 “International Year of Astronomy 2009 Final Report” International Astronomical Union, {{ISBN|978-3-923524-65-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; FETTU displayed large-scale images of astronomical objects with contextual information and supplementary materials and activities in non-traditional and mostly public locations such as parks, airports, art festivals, shopping malls, and others (see examples at http://www.fromearthtotheuniverse.org/event_photos.php). By 2011, FETTU had been exhibited at about 1000 sites worldwide, with 50 sites in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Arcand, K.K., Watzke, M., 2010, “Bringing the Universe to the Street: A Preliminary Look at Informal Learning Implications for a Large-Scale Non-traditional Science Outreach Project”. JCOM Journal of Science Communication. Vol. 09, Issue 02, 1. http://jcom.sissa.it/archive/09/02/Jcom0902%282010%29A01/&lt;/ref&gt; One result from FETTU demonstrated a trend towards more non-self-selective audiences for science communications in these public spaces.

Tory Higgins]] regarding people's [[perceptions]] in the [[decision making]] process. RFT examines the relationship between the [[motivation]] of a person and the way in which they go about achieving their [[goal]].&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, E: "Making a Good Decision: Value From Fit", ''American Psychologist'' 55(11):1217&lt;/ref&gt; RFT posits two separate and independent self-regulatory orientations: prevention and promotion (Higgins, 1997).

This psychological [[theory]], like many others, is applied in [[communication]], specifically in the subfields of [[nonverbal communication]] and [[persuasion]].Chronic regulatory focus is measured using the Regulatory Focus Questionnaire (Higgins et al., 2001) or the Regulatory Strength measure. Momentary regulatory focus can be primed or induced.

==Background==

===Regulatory fit theory===
To understand RFT, it is important to understand another of [[E. Tory Higgins]]' [[theories]]: regulatory fit theory. When a person believes that there is "fit", they will involve themselves more in what they are doing and "feel right" about it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Higgins, E. T. (2005). Value From Regulatory Fit. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 14(4), 209–213. {{doi|10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00366.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|209}}  Regulatory fit should not directly affect the [[hedonic]] occurrence of a thing or occasion, but should influence a person's assurance in their reaction to the [[Object (philosophy)|object]] or event.

Regulatory fit theory suggests that a match between orientation to a goal and the means used to approach that goal produces a state of regulatory fit that both creates a feeling of rightness about the goal pursuit and increases task engagement (Higgins, 2001, 2005). Regulatory fit intensifies responses, such as the value of a chosen object, persuasion, and job satisfaction&lt;ref&gt;Kruglanski, A. W., Pierro, A., &amp; Higgins, E. T. (2007). Regulatory Mode and Preferred Leadership Styles: How Fit Increases Job Satisfaction. Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 29(2), 137–149. {{doi|10.1080/01973530701331700}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Regulatory fit does not increase the assessment of a [[decision making|decision]]; instead when someone feels "right" about their decision, the [[experience]] of "correctness and importance" is transferred to the ensuing assessment of the chosen [[Object (philosophy)|object]], increasing its superficial worth.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Avnet, T: "Locomotion, assessment, and regulatory fit: Value transfer from 'how' to 'what'", Journal of Experimental Psychology 39(5):525&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that the "feeling right" [[experience]] can then sway [[retrospective]] or prospective evaluations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Regulatory fit can be manipulated incidentally (outside the context of interest) or integrally (within the context of interest).

===Definition===
RFT refers to when a person pursues a [[goal]] in a way that maintains the person's own personal [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s and [[beliefs]], also known as ''regulatory orientation''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; This [[theory]] operates on the basic [[principle]] that people embrace [[pleasure]] but avoid [[suffering|pain]], and they then maintain their regulatory fit based on this standard.

The ''regulatory focus'' is basically the way in which someone approaches pleasure but avoids pain. An individual's regulatory focus concentrates on desired end-states, and the approach [[motivation]] used to go from the current state to the desired end-state. This theory differentiates between a ''promotion-focus'' on [[hope]]s and accomplishments, also known as gains. This focus is more concerned with higher level gains such as advancement and accomplishment.&lt;ref name=Higgins&gt;Higgins, E: "Achievement orientations from subjective histories of success: promotion pride versus prevention pride", ''European Journal of Social Psychology''. 31(1):4&lt;/ref&gt;

Another focus is the ''prevention-focus'' based on [[safety]] and [[moral responsibility|responsibilities]], also known as non-losses. This focus emphasizes security and safety by following the guidelines and the rules.&lt;ref name=Higgins/&gt;

These two regulatory focuses regulate the influences that a person would be exposed to in the [[decision-making]] process, and determine the different ways they achieve their goal, as discussed by RFT. An individual's regulatory orientation is not necessarily fixed. While individuals have [[Habit (psychology)|chronic]] tendencies towards either promotion or prevention, these preferences may not hold for all situations. Furthermore, a specific regulatory focus can be [[wikt:induce|induced]].

The [[Value (ethics)|value]] taken from interaction and goal attainment can be either positive or negative. The decision has positive value when people attempt to attain their goal in a way that fits their regulatory orientation and it will have negative value when people attempt to attain their goal in a way that does not fit their regulatory orientation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Regulatory fit allows value to be created by intensifying the commitment, based on one of the regulatory focus orientations. Making [[choices]] and fulfilling [[objective (goal)|objective]]s are considered as activities, and with any activity, people can be more or less involved. When this involvement is strong, it can intensify the feelings and values about this activity, and the approach to the activity determines whether they are or are not satisfied with the outcome and method of achieving the outcome.

This theory has noteworthy implications for increasing the value of life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} For example, in [[interpersonal]] conflict, if each person experiences "fit", each one will be satisfied with and committed to the outcome. In the broad sense, for people to appreciate their own lives, they need to be satisfied and "feel right" about what they are doing, and the way they are doing it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|210}} If it is not satisfying, it is known as "non-fit", and they will not reach their desired goal.

===Goal attainment and motivation===
Regulatory focus theory, according to Higgins, views motivation in a way that allows an understanding of the foundational ways we approach a task or a [[goal]].&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, E. (1997, December) Beyond pleasure and pain. ''American Psychologist'', 52(12):1281&lt;/ref&gt; Different factors can motivate people during goal pursuit, and we self-regulate our methods and processes during our goal pursuit. RFT proposes that motivational strength is enhanced when the manner in which people work toward a goal sustains their regulatory orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Spiegel, S: "How regulatory fit enhances motivational strength during goal pursuit", European Journal of Social Psychology. 34(1):40&lt;/ref&gt; Achieving a goal in a way that is consistent to a person's regulatory orientation leads to an [[individual]] sense of importance to the event. The impact of [[motivation]] is considered calculated and this creates a greater sense of commitment to the goal. The more strongly an individual is engaged (i.e., involved, occupied, fully engrossed) in an activity, the more intense the motivational force experienced. Engagement is of great importance to attain and motivate in order to reach a goal. Engagement serves as intensifier of the directional component of the value experience. An individual who is strongly engaged in a goal pursuits will experience a positive target more positively and a negative target more negatively.

Individuals can pursue different goals with diverse regulatory orientations and in unlike ways. There are two different kinds of regulatory orientations that people use to obtain their goals: ''promotion-focus orientation'' and ''prevention-focus orientation''. These terms are derived from [[E. Tory Higgins]]'s Theory of Regulatory Focus. In which, he adds to the notion that people regulate their goal-oriented behavior in two very distinct ways, coined ''promotion-focus orientation'' and ''prevention-focus orientation''

[[E. Tory Higgins]] uses this example: there is Student A and Student B, and they both have the shared goal to make an ''A'' in a class they are both taking in college. Student A uses a ''promotion-focus orientation'' which slants them towards achieving their goal and towards advancement, growth and life accomplishment. This would cause Student A to view the goal as an [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]] that satisfies their need for accomplishment. Student B uses a ''prevention-focus orientation'' where the goal is something that should be realized because it fulfills their need for [[security]], [[Safety|protection]] and prevention of negative outcomes. Student A uses an eager approach where they read extra materials to obtain their goal of an ''A''. Student B uses a vigilant approach where they become more detail oriented and pay careful attention to completing all of the course requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, R., &amp; Buss, D. (2009). Personality psychology: domains of knowledge about human nature. (4th ed., p. 388).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Completed RFT flowchart 3.jpg]]

Both forms of regulatory orientation can work to fulfill goals, but the choice of [[orientation (mental)|orientation]] is based on individual [[preference]]s and style. When a person pursues their goal in the focus that fits their regulatory orientation, they are more likely to pursue their goal more eagerly and aggressively than if they were using the other focus.In this case each student has different styles. They both feel more comfortable in persuading their goal. The outcome in this experiment would have been different if the students were given an undesirable choice.

When people make decisions, they often envision the possible "[[pleasure]] or [[suffering|pain]]" of the possible outcomes that the focus orientation will produce.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|209}} A person imagining making a pleasing choice is more likely to engage in promotion-focus orientation because envisioning the possible outcome of success maintains eagerness about the outcome but does not place importance on [[Vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]]. A person imagining the possible [[suffering|pain]] by making an undesirable choice maintains more vigilance but less eagerness.

A person with promotion-focus orientation is more likely to remember the occasions where the goal is pursued by using eagerness approaches and less likely to remember occasions where the goal is pursued by vigilance approaches. A person with prevention-focus orientation is more likely to remember events where the goal is pursued by means of vigilance than if it was pursued using eagerness approaches.

==Application==

===Regulatory focus theory and persuasion===
When relating regulatory focus theory to [[persuasion]], it is important to remember that RFT is a [[goal]]-attainment [[theory]], and that RFT can spawn feelings of rightness/wrongness which in turn may produce formulations for [[judgment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn, A: "'This story is right on': The impact of regulatory fit on narrative engagement and persuasion", European Journal of Social Psychology. 39:448&lt;/ref&gt;

The feelings of rightness give an [[individual]] more commitment to the [[information]] coming in and therefore can avoid endangering their regulatory fit which in turn changes their regulatory focus and accepting a probable motive to change. If a person experiences feelings of wrongness they will suffer negative [[emotion]]s and deem the [[experience]] 
and information as a [[threat]] to their regulatory fit and therefore a threat to their regulatory focus and their [[goal]].

Studies have been done where fit and focus have been applied to show their applicability to [[consumer]] [[purchasing]], health advisories, and [[social policy]] issues.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|446}} To be persuaded is to change your prior feelings, actions, and/or beliefs on a matter to where you agree with the persuader.

The "fit" involved in RFT plays a large role in such issues and stories because it can be a device to help an [[individual]] receive and review the experience during a particular [[message]] delivery. [[Positive reinforcement]] and [[feeling]]s of rightness while decoding the [[message]] creates a stronger engagement and relationship with processing the [[message]], and [[negative reinforcement]] and feelings of wrongness lessens the engagement and [[Attachment theory|attachment]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|449}}

[[Researcher]]s found that targeting the two different regulatory focus orientations, and their coinciding types of fit, works as an effective process to aid in [[persuasive]] charm or pull when they introduced a manner of [[persuasion]] where the framing of the [[message]] was everything and the content was [[irrelevant]] to uphold or interrupt a person's regulatory fit and follow the pattern of logic used in regulatory orientation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|446}}

Lee and Aaker (2004) conducted an [[experiment]] that involved whether or not to give their information in a prevention-focus- or promotion-focus-concerning way. The study involved an [[advertisement]] for a grape juice drink, which they split into two to create prevention-focus concerns (disease-preventing) and then promotion-focus concerns (energy enhancement).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|449}} In doing so, they demonstrated that rather than trying to know each [[individual]] recipient's qualities, one needs only to start by nailing the focus (prevention/promotion) and then framing the [[message]] so that it creates that "rightness".

Some may confuse RFT with regulatory fit, regulatory relevance, message matching, and source attractiveness in such an example. The extent of similarities between closely related [[theories]] of RFT, such as ones stated above, make it hard to clarify when this theory is applicable or apparent in respect to the [[persuasion]] process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|444–5}}

===Regulatory focus theory and nonverbal communication===
RFT can be a useful outline for a better understanding of the effects of [[nonverbal]] cues in [[persuasion]] and [[impression formation]]. Regulatory Fit Theory suggests that the effect of a cue cannot be understood without remembering what the cue means given a recipient's focus orientation.&lt;ref name="Cesario 2008"&gt;Cesario, J., Higgins, E. (2008 May) Making Message Recipients "Feel Right": How Nonverbal Cues Can Increase Persuasion. Psychological Science, 19(5)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|419}}

[[Nonverbal]] cues can be used by the [[message]] source to vary delivery style, more specifically to convey eagerness or vigilance, of a given message in a way that will produce regulatory fit in message recipients of different focus orientations.

Advancement implies eager movement forward, so eagerness is conveyed by gestures that involve animated, broad opening movements such as hand movements projecting outward, forward leaning body positions, fast body movement, and fast [[speech]] rate. Caution implies vigilant carefulness, so vigilance should be conveyed by [[gesture]]s that show precision like slightly backward-leaning body positions, slower body movement, and slower speech rate.

An eager [[nonverbal]] delivery style will result in greater [[message]] effectiveness for promotion-focus recipients than for prevention-focus recipients, while the opposite is true for a vigilant [[nonverbal]] style.

There are various aspects, which may contribute to whether or not a [[message]]'s [[persuasive]] element is successful. One aspect is the effect of [[nonverbal]] cues and their association with [[persuasive]] appeals based on the [[message]] recipient's [[motivation]]al regulatory orientation. This determines the recipient's impression of the source during [[impression formation]].

Research has found that [[nonverbal]] cues are an essential element of most [[persuasive]] appeals. RFT creates the background that allows a [[prediction]] for when and for whom a [[nonverbal]] cue can have an effect on [[persuasion]]. When [[nonverbal]] cues and signals are used appropriately, they increase the effectiveness of [[persuasion]].&lt;ref name="Cesario 2008"/&gt;{{rp|415}}

A '''sex symbol''' is a [[Celebrity|famous person]] or fictional character widely regarded to be very [[sexual attractiveness|sexually attractive]].&lt;ref name=pam&gt;[[Pam Cook]], "The trouble with sex: Diana Dors and the Blonde bombshell phenomenon", In: Bruce Babinigton (ed.), ''British Stars and Stardom: From Alma Taylor to Sean Connery'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=vxmQJRr0vL8C&amp;pg=PA169 pp. 169–171]. Quote: "– the sex symbol is usually defined in terms of her excessive sexuality"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The term ''sex symbol'' was first used in the mid-1950s in relation to the popularity of certain film stars and [[Pin-up model|pin-up models]], including [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Brigitte Bardot]], and [[Raquel Welch]].&lt;ref name=Flexner&gt;{{cite book |title=Speaking freely: a guided tour of American English from Plymouth Rock to Silicon Valley |first=Stuart Berg |last=Flexner |authorlink=Stuart Berg Flexner |first2=Anne H. |last2=Soukhanov |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1997 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FlANAQAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22sex+symbol%22 373] |isbn=0-19-510692-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was a reflection of the post-[[World War II]] increase of sexual and economic emancipation of women.&lt;ref name=pam/&gt; 

In the 20th century, sex symbols could be male as well as female: actors such as the romantic [[Sessue Hayakawa]] and the athletic [[Douglas Fairbanks]] were popular in the 1910s and 1920s. Archetypal screen lover [[Rudolph Valentino]]'s death in 1926 caused mass hysteria among his female fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hutchinson |first1=Pamela |title=Last of the red-hot myths: what gossip over Rudolph Valentino's sex life says about the silents |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/22/silent-but-deadly-rudolph-valentino-ken-russell-film-blu-ray |newspaper=The Guardian |date=22 February 2016 |accessdate=12 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--staff writers, no byline--&gt; |title=The Queen at 90: The key events of 1926, in pictures |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/21/the-queen-at-90-the-key-events-of-1926-in-pictures/hollywood-heart-throb-rudolph-valentino-died-unexpectedly-at-the/ |newspaper=The DailyTelegraph |date=21 April 2016 |accessdate=12 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hollywood, many film stars were seen as sex symbols, such as [[Errol Flynn]], [[Gary Cooper]], and [[Clark Gable]]. The "bad boy" image of the 1950s was epitomized by sex symbols such as [[James Dean]] and [[Marlon Brando]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editors=Weinberg, Thomas S.; Newmahr, Staci|year=2014|title=Selves, Symbols, and Sexualities: An Interactionist Anthology: An Interactionist Anthology|location=Los Angeles|publisher=Sage Publications|ISBN=1483323897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[Elvis Presley]] obituary, [[Lester Bangs]] credited him as "the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America,"{{sfn|Rodman|1996|pp=58–59}} in the 1950s and 1960s, through his overtly suggestive dance moves.

==Fictional sex symbols==
With regard to fiction, [[Rotten Tomatoes]] states that the 1930s cartoon character [[Betty Boop]] is "the first and most famous sex symbol on animated screen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/betty_boop_boop_oop_a_doop/|title=Betty Boop: Boop Oop a Doop|publisher=Rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jessica Rabbit]] (voiced by [[Kathleen Turner]]) from the 1988 live-action/animation crossover film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' has been described as a sex symbol as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/home/world-news/article/16078068|title=Amanda Knox Is Like Jessica Rabbit|publisher=[[Sky News]]|date=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Toot Braunstein]] (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) from the adult animated sitcom [[Drawn Together]] is also considered as a sex symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=EGtTOAGYSWQC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=toot+braunstein+"sex+symbol"&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3abbT4WQvz&amp;sig=E11aFCGxuMVcueMdEAyuMO4QItA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiw1r6Y0cTdAhWJQY8KHTogDlQ4ChDoATAGegQIABAB#v=onepage&amp;q=toot%20braunstein%20"sex%20symbol"&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video games have had a few characters that are considered sex symbols; one example would be [[Lara Croft]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E1DF1238F93AA25752C0A96E958260|title=Video World Is Smitten by a Gun-Toting, Tomb-Raiding Sex Symbol|work=[[The New York Times]] | first=David|last=Barboza|date=19 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="channel4_poll"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/film/newsfeatures/microsites/S/sexsymbols/results/10-1.html |title=Channel 4 Top 100 Sex Symbols internet poll |publisher=Channel4.com |accessdate=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2001/06/24/do10.xml|title=Boom Raider|work=Telegraph|accessdate=March 5, 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has had several appearances in mainstream media.

'''Sexecology''' (also ecosexuality) is a radical form of [[environmental activism]] based around nature fetishism, the idea of the earth as a lover. It invites people to treat the earth with love rather than see it as an infinite resource to exploit.&lt;ref name="Lechner"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lechner|first=Marie|title=Annie Sprinkle, un cas d'écolo-sexe|url=http://next.liberation.fr/arts/2013/09/25/annie-sprinkle-un-cas-d-ecolo-sexe_934661|publisher=Next Libération|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by [[Elizabeth Stephens]] and [[Annie Sprinkle]], who describe themselves as "two ecosexual artists-in-love", whose manifesto is to make environment activism "more sexy, fun, and diverse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=sexecology.org|title=Sex Ecology|url=http://sexecology.org/|accessdate=22 October 2013| date=n.d.|publisher=Elizabeth Stephens and Annie Sprinkle.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexecology employs [[absurdist humor]], [[performance art]] and [[sex-positivity]], which Stephens claims "may produce new forms of knowledge that hold potential to alter the future by privileging our desire for the Earth to function with as many diverse, intact and flourishing ecological systems as possible."&lt;ref name=ES&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Elizabeth Stephens|website=elizabethstephens.org|title=PAR: ''Goodbye Gauley Mountain: An Ecosexual Love Story''|url=http://elizabethstephens.org/par-goodbye-gauley-mountain-an-ecosexual-love-story/|accessdate=22 October 2013|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corinne|first=Van Houten|title=Goodbye Gauley Mountain: An Ecosexual Love Story: Beth Stephens and Annie Sprinkle Marry A Mountain| journal=Artcore| date=July 21, 2013|volume=2|issue=1|url=http://artcorejournal.net/2013/07/21/goodbye-gauley-mountain-an-ecosexual-love-story-beth-stephens-and-annie-sprinkle-marry-a-mountain-by-corinne-van-houten/}}&lt;/ref&gt; "&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Reed |first=Jennifer J. |year=2015 |editor-last=Anderlini-D’Onofrio   |editor-first=SerenaGaia  |editor2-last=Hagamen |editor2-first=Lindsay  |title=From Ecofeminism to Ecosexuality: Queering the Environmental Movement |url=https://www.academia.edu/6147985/From_Ecofeminism_to_Ecosexuality_Queering_the_Environmental_Movement |journal=Ecosexuality: When Nature Inspires the Arts of Love |pages=92–102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple promote education, events such as the ecosex symposium, and activism, such as protecting the Appalachian Mountains from [[Mountaintop removal mining|mountain top removal]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Difference from ecofeminism ==
Sexecology conceives of the earth not as a mother, but as a lover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elizabeth Stephens|url=http://art.ucsc.edu/faculty/elizabeth-stephens|work=Faculty List|publisher=Art Faculty UC Santa Cruz|accessdate=22 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101000948/http://art.ucsc.edu/faculty/elizabeth-stephens |archivedate=1 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conceptual shift invites people to engage their bodies and senses in acts of environmental preservation.&lt;ref name="ES"/&gt;

Unlike [[ecofeminism]], sexecology does not see an intrinsic link between women and nature; some of the limitations of ecofeminism which sex ecology indirectly addresses are "the reliance on women's biological functions to establish a connection between women and nature, the uncritical over-privileging of women's experiences, the inappropriateness of designating ideal female characteristics, and the regressive political implications of associating women with nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Archambault|first=Anne|title=A Critique of Ecofeminism|journal=Canadian Woman Studies|volume=13|issue=3|page=21|url=http://pi.library.yorku.ca/ojs/index.php/cws/article/download/10403/9492|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The formulation of an Eco-Sexual identity is a practice of an erotic eco-logic, deconstructing heteronormative constructions of gender, sex, sexuality, and nature in order to continually queer and destabilize identities, actively form and retain spaces of lack that necessitate interdependency, and engage a permeable sensuous self in perpetual sensorial reciprocity with the sensing and sensible more-than-human environment. It is an identity identified by desire rather than a stable essence or being, and it is a desire for the more-than-human environment in which the human subject is sensorially implicit."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Ecosexuals==

Proponents of this movement are called "ecosexuals"; they are unafraid to engage in and embrace their erotic experience with the earth, such as bathing naked, having sex with vegetables or having an orgasm in a waterfall.&lt;ref name="Lechner"/&gt; Stephens describes ecosexuals as people who "... are related to [[cyborgs]] and are not afraid of engaging in intercourse with nature and/or with technology for that matter. We make love with the Earth through our senses."&lt;ref name="ES"/&gt;

Ecosexuals range from those who use sustainable sex products and like being nude in nature to those who "roll around in the dirt having an orgasm covered in potting soil" and those who "masturbate under a waterfall"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/read/ecosexuals-believe-having-sex-with-the-earth-could-save-it|title=Ecosexuals Believe Having Sex with the Earth Could Save It {{!}} VICE {{!}} United States|date=2016-11-02|newspaper=VICE|language=en-us|access-date=2016-12-02|author=Neil McArthur}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[Sprinkle and Stephens] have officiated wedding ceremonies where they and fellow ecosexuals marry the earth, the moon, and other natural entities" &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  They have also stated that they believe there are over 100,000 people who identify as ecosexual worldwide&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
Stefanie Iris Weiss wrote a book about using sustainable sex products called ''Eco-sex: Go Green Between the Sheets and Make Your Love Life Sustainable''. She brings up the environmental impact and the carbon footprint we leave behind when using condoms, lube, and other sex products. The overall purpose of the book is to bring awareness of the environmental impact of current sex products while introducing more eco-friendly alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecosex.net/ecosex-the-book-2/|title=Eco-Sex: The Book {{!}} Eco-Sex|website=ecosex.net|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human/nonhuman relationships ==

Sexecology seeks to direct attention towards “the ways in which sex and sexuality affect the larger nonhuman world.” Ecosexuality is an orientation directed toward the non-human material world. With this direction, ecosexuality makes a bold statement that “these human bodies are part of the nonhuman material world.” The blur between human and non-human entities is essential to Sprinkles and Stephens’ demonstration of sexecology.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Michael. "Material Entanglements With the Nonhuman World: Theorizing Ecosexualities in Performance." Electronic Thesis or Dissertation. Ohio State University, 2015.OhioLINK Electronic Theses and Dissertations Center. 02 Dec 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexecology was influenced by contemporary theories around [[posthumanism]] and the relationships between humans and nonhumans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haraway|first=Donna|title=When Species Meet|year=2008|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|pages=360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Donna Haraway|Haraway]]’s work has guided my understanding of the material consequences and the theoretical underpinnings embedded in human/nonhuman relationships that matrix our world. This has helped me understand how [[human exceptionalism]] has been constructed and privileged throughout the history of religion and science as well as in other secular practices in western culture. Human exceptionalism, in collaboration with [[global capitalism]], has created the isolated space necessary for the ongoing practices that have produced the dangerously degraded environmental conditions in which we now live. The belief systems and ideologies that allow some people to think that they have the [[Darwinian fitness|Darwinian survival skill]] and the rights that accompany those skills to use or destroy other human and non humans is now causing the kind of [[environmental degradation]] that affects the whole system sooner or later."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elizabethstephens.org/par-goodbye-gauley-mountain-an-ecosexual-love-story/|title=PAR: Goodbye Gauley Mountain:An Ecosexual Love Story|last=Stephens|first=Elizabeth|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performances and workshops==

“The Love Art Lab projects aim to instill hope, create an antidote to fear, and act as a call for action.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anniesprinkle.org/projects/current-projects/assuming-the-ecosexual-position-adventures-of-the-love-art-lab/|title=Assuming the Ecosexual Position: Adventures of the Love Art Lab |website=anniesprinkle.org|date=n.d.|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a private demonstration into the work of the two founders of the movement, Sprinkles and Stephens, as the research how to become "lovers with the earth. The performances can be privately booked by contacting the two and are meant to be demonstrational, informative, and "radical."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Sprinkles and Stephens have performed a number of "weddings to the earth" across the world intended to break the barrier between human sexuality and nature. The performances include "Wedding to the Dirt, Wedding to Lake Kallavesi, Wedding to the Coal, Wedding to the Rocks, Wedding to the Snow, Wedding to the Moon, Wedding to the Appalachian Mountains, Wedding to the Earth, and Wedding to the Sea", to date. The intention, according to Sprinkles, is to "…shift the metaphor from ‘Earth as Mother’ to ‘Earth as Lover´" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sexecology.org/ecosex-weddings/|title=Ecosex Weddings, weddings with nonhuman natural elements| website=sexecology.org| date=n.d.|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sprinkles and Stephens have performed a two women show 25 Ways to Make Love to the Earth (Theatre Piece) at the Kosmos Theatre in Vienna in 2010 to demonstrate how to "make love with the earth", including talking, singing, dancing, and stroking natural objects. The performances are educational as well as self-promoting of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sexecology.org/projects/dirty-sexecology-25-ways-to-make-love-to-the-earth/|title=Dirty Sexecology: 25 Ways to Make Love to the Earth (Theater Piece)|website=sexecology.org|date=n.d.|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aesthetic strategies of sexecology are influenced by [[Joseph Beuys]]' concept of [[social sculpture]], which sees art as having the potential to transform society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beuys|first=Joseph|title=What is Art?|year=2004|publisher=Clairview|location=Forest Row|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beuys|first=Joseph|title=Joseph Beuys in America : Energy Plan for the Western Man : Writings by and Interviews with the Artist|year=1990|publisher=Four Walls Eight Windows|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"... the production of visible art may effect the production of invisible ideological and class relations. For Joseph Beuys, sculpture and artistic creativity hold the potential to reshape the educational and governmental institutions that produce ideological subjects, as well as social, political, and economic systems. Art, Beuys argues, is the necessary condition for the production of a revolutionary society because it can both unravel the old order and engage everyone in the production of a new social order."&lt;ref name=ES/&gt;

Ecosexuals have held a number of educational workshops.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} They have engaged in on-site environmental activism, such as "Occupy Bernal"{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} and protests against mountaintop removal, as shown in the film "Goodbye Gauley Mountain: An Ecosexual Love Story."

===''Goodbye Gauley Mountain: An Ecosexual Love Story'' (film) ===

''Goodbye Gauley Mountain: An Ecosexual Love Story'' (2013) is a [[autoethnographic]] documentary film by Elizabeth Stephens with Annie Sprinkle about the environmental issue of [[Mountaintop removal]] in [[West Virginia, United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/greg-archer/mountaintop-removal-two-e_b_4312730.html|title=Mountaintop Removal: Two Ecosexuals Fight Back Hard.|last=Archer|first=Greg|date=20 November 2013|website=|publisher=Huffington Post|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Virginia native Stephens returns to her childhood home to create a film that incorporates autobiography, a brief history of the coal industry, an inventory of activist strategies, an eco-sexual mini-manifesto, and finally, an example of the performance art Stephens and Sprinkle often employ to express their ecosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clemons|first=Tammy|year=2014|title=Goodbye Gauley Mountain: An Ecosexual Love Story|url=https://www.academia.edu/9744023/Film_Review_of_Goodbye_Gauley_Mountain_An_Ecosexual_Love_Story_|journal=Journal of Appalachian Studies|volume= 20| issue = 1|pages=91–93|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephens presents a community struggling to rectify their love of their natural mountainous environment with the fact that its destruction via MTR provides the local economy. The piece explores the negative consequences of mountaintop removal, both cosmetic and environmental, and culminates in an exploration of ecosexuality, followed by wedding ceremony in which Stephens and Sprinkle "marry" the mountain. “Ecosexuality inserts an ‘erotic’ humor that plays against the horrific subject matter. So far the feedback that I’ve received at film previews makes me realize that these are effective strategies for creating space to briefly cut the feeling of despair that MTR evokes.”

[[File:Public opinion of interracial marriage in the United States.png|thumb|526x526px|Graph indicating the extent to which US citizens agree or disagree with [[interracial marriage]], spanning 1958-2007.]]
'''Sexual racial preference''' is the individual's sexual preference of specific races. It is an inclination towards potential sexual or romantic partners on the basis of perceived racial identity. Not everyone agrees that this should be classified as racism, some argue that distinguishing among partners on the basis of perceived race is not racism at all but a justifiable personal preference.&lt;ref&gt;Callander, D., Newman, C. E., &amp; Holt, M. (2015). Is sexual racism really racism? Distinguishing attitudes toward sexual racism and generic racism among gay and bisexual men. Archives of sexual behavior, 44(7), 1991-2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of sexual racism can be explained by looking at its history, especially in the US, where the abolition of slavery and the [[Reconstruction Era]] had significant impacts on interracial mixing. Attitudes towards interracial relationships, and indeed marriage, have increased in positivity in the last 50 years. In 1968, 73% of US citizens disapproved of the right to marry inter-racially, whereas this figure dropped to 17% by 2007, this illustrating the reduction in discriminatory attitudes towards interracial dating.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, J. (2007, August 16). Most Americans approve of interracial marriages. Retrieved from http:// www.gallup.com/poll/28417/most-americansapprove-interracial-marriages.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Irrespective of this, there still remains the issue of sexual racism in the [[Online dating service|online dating]] world, in that preferences appear to follow a racial hierarchy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}  Sharing the basic premise, originating from the '[[taboo]]' nature of interracial relations, individuals of other racial groups are classified as forbidden sexual objects; the result of a [[Racial fetishism|racial fetish]].

== History ==

=== United States of America ===

After the abolition of [[slavery]] in 1865, the white Americans showed an increasing fear of racial mixture.&lt;ref&gt;Yancey, G. (2007). "Experiencing Racism: Differences in the Experiences of Whites Married to Blacks and Non-Black Racial Minorities". Journal of Comparative Family Studies. University of Calgary: Social Sciences. 38 (2): 197–213.&lt;/ref&gt;  The remnants of the racial divide became stronger post-slavery as the concept of [[Whiteness studies|whiteness]] developed. There was a widely held belief that uncontrollable lust threatens the purity of the nation.  This increased white anxiety about interracial sex, and has been described through [[Montesquieu]]'s climatic theory in his book the [[The Spirit of the Laws|Spirit of the Laws]], which explains how people from different climates have different temperaments, "The inhabitants of warm countries are, like old men, timorous; the people in cold countries are, like young men, brave."&lt;ref&gt;De Montesquieu, C. (1989). Montesquieu: The Spirit of the Laws. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, black women held the jezebel stereotype, which claimed black women often initiated sex outside of marriage and were generally sexually promiscuous.&lt;ref&gt;West, C. M. (1995). Mammy, Sapphire, and Jezebel: Historical images of Black women and their implications for psychotherapy. Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training, 32(3), 458.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea stemmed from the first encounters between European men and African women. As the men were not used to the extremely hot climate they misinterpreted the women's lack of clothing for vulgarity.&lt;ref&gt;White, D. B. (1999). Ar'n't I a Woman. W.W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, black men were stereotyped for having a specific lust for white women. This created tension, as if white men were having sex with black women because they were more lustful, this meant black men would lust after white women in the same way, this threatened the white male dominance that was apparent at the time, increasing the fear of interracial interactions.

There are a few potential reasons as to why such strong ideas on interracial sex developed. The [[Reconstruction Era]] following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] started to disassemble traditional aspects of Southern society. The Southerners who were used to being dominant were now no longer legally allowed to run their farms using slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, E. and Mahoney O. (2003). America's Reconstruction: People and Politics After the Civil War.&lt;/ref&gt; Many whites struggled with this reformation and attempted to find loopholes to continue the exploitation of black labour. Additionally, the white Democrats were not pleased with the outcome and felt a sense of inadequacy among white men. This led to them taking out their frustration on the black population. This radical reconstruction of the South was deeply unpopular and slowly unravelled leading to the introduction of the [[Jim Crow laws]].&lt;ref&gt;Kousser, J. M. (2003). Jim Crow Laws. Dictionary of American History, 4, 479-480.&lt;/ref&gt; There was an increased the sense of white dominance and sexual racism among the Southern people.

There were general heightened tensions following the end of the failed civil war in 1865, and this increased the sexual anxiety in the population. Races did not want to mix, the whites were feeling inadequate and wanted to take back control. The [[Ku Klux Klan]] then formed in 1867, which led to violence and terrorism targeting the black population.&lt;ref&gt;Wade, W. C. (1998). The Fiery Cross: The Ku Klux Klan in America. Oxford University Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a rise in [[Lynching|lynch]] mob violence where many black men were accused of rape. This was not just senseless violence, but an attempt to preserve 'whiteness' and prevent racial blur, the whites wanted to remain dominant and make sure there was no interracial sexual activity. For example, mixed race couples that chose to live together were sought out and lynched by the KKK. The famous case of Emmett Till who was lynched at the age of fourteen for supposedly whistling at a white women shows the prominence of white male anxiety in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield, S. J. (1991). A death in the delta: The story of Emmett Till. JHU Press.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Jim Crow laws were eventually overturned, it took years for the court to resolve the numerous acts of discrimination.

==Heterosexual community==
Sexual racism exists in both the heterosexual and homosexual communities across the globe. The prevalence of interracial couples demonstrate how attitudes have changed in the last 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelsohn, G. A., Taylor, L. S., Fiore, A. T. &amp; Cheshire, C. (2014). Black/White Dating Online: Interracial Courtship in the 21st Century. Psychology of Popular Media Culture, 3, 2-18.&lt;/ref&gt; A case that has perhaps received heightened publicity is that of [[Loving v. Virginia|Mildred and Richard Loving]]. The couple lived in Virginia yet had to marry outside the state due to the [[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States|anti-miscegenation]] laws present in nearly half of the US states in 1958. Once married, the pair returned to Virginia, and were both arrested in their home for the infringement of the [[Racial Integrity Act of 1924|Racial Integrity Act]], and each sentenced to a year in prison. Prior to the repeal of these laws in 2000, several attempts were made to void the sentence, ultimately the couple resorted to relocation to avoid further prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;Moran, R. F. (2007). Loving and the Legacy of Unintended Consequences. Wis. L. Rev, 239, 240-281.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Bill de Blasio family 2012.jpg|thumb|204x204px|[[Bill de Blasio]] and [[Chirlane McCray]] with their two children in 2012, attending a silent march.]]
Around a similar time was the controversy surrounding [[Seretse Khama|Seretse and Ruth Khama]]. Seretse was the chief of an eminent Botswanan tribe, and Ruth an English student. The pair married in 1948 but experienced frequent discrimination from the onset of the relationship, including Seretse's removal from his tribal responsibilities as chief. For nearly 10 years, Seretse and Ruth lived as exiles in Britain, as the racism towards their relationship remained strong. British officials hoped that their asylum in the country would reduce their desire to continue the marriage. Once the couple were allowed to return home in 1956, they became prominent figures the movement for racial and social justice, contributing to Seretse's election as president of Botswana in 1966. Later, they both continued to fight laws surrounding interracial marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, N. (1993). The impact of Seretse Khama on British public opinion 1948-56 and 1978. Historical Studies in Ethnicity, Migration and Diaspora, 12, 195-219.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent examples portray the increasingly accepting attitudes of the majority to interracial relationships and marriage. In 2013, [[Bill de Blasio]] was elected as Mayor of New York City, accompanied by his wife, [[Chirlane McCray]]. The pair are one of the first interracial couples to stand in power side by side. Both de Blasio and McCray are active political figures, and although they are not exempt from racial discrimination, the attitudes of the world to interracial marriage are much more positive and optimistic than in previous decades.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, D. &amp; Mahler, H. (2014). Primary health care: The Return of Health for All. World Nutrition, 5(4), 336-365.&lt;/ref&gt; Across much of the world, it is ever increasingly the situation that interracial couples can live, marry and have children without prosecution that was previously rife, due to major changes in law along with reductions in discriminatory attitudes. Sexual racism also exists in the [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] community in [[Online dating service|online dating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/issue-sections/features-issue-sections/11404/online-dating-tinder-racism/|title=The Weird Racial Politics of Online Dating|last=Sankin|first=Aaron|date=January 18, 2015|work=[[The Kernel]]|publisher=The Daily Dot|accessdate=April 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/09/no-blacks-is-not-a-sexual-preference-it-s-racism.html|title='No Blacks' Is Not a Sexual Preference.

=== Online dating ===
[[File:OnLineDating World 201602.png|thumb|373x373px|Monthly visitors to different [[Online dating service|Online Dating services]] globally in February 2016]]
In the last 15 years, online dating has overtaken previously preferred methods of meeting with potential partners, surpassing both the occupational setting and area of residence as chosen locations. This spike is consistent with an increase in access to the internet in homes across the globe, in addition to the number of dating sites available to individuals differing in [[ageing|age]], [[gender]], [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[sexual orientation]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnic background]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, M. J. &amp; Thomas, R. J. (2012). Searching for a Mate: The Rise of the Internet as a Social Intermediary. American Sociological Review, 77(4), 523-547.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with this, there has been a rise in online sexual racism, whereby partner race is now the most highly selected preference chosen by users when creating their online profiles, displacing both educational and religious characteristics.&lt;ref name="Hitsch2006"&gt;Hitsch, G. J., Hortacsu, A. &amp; Ariely, D. (2006). What makes you click? Partner preferences and matching outcomes in online dating. MIT Sloan Research Paper No. 4603-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has indicated a progressive acceptance of interracial relationships by White individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Schuman, H., Steeh, C., Bobo, L &amp; Krysan, M. (1997). Racial Attitudes in America: Trends and Interpretations (revised edition): Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of White Americans are not against interracial relationships and marriage,&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig, J.

Retrieved from http://www.gallup.com/poll/11836/acceptance-interracial-marriage-record-high.aspx, 23.11.2016, 20:00pm.&lt;/ref&gt; however these [[belief]]s are not illustrated in subsequent marital rates between interracial couples, such that no more than 4% of White Americans will wed outside their own race.&lt;ref&gt;Qian, Z., &amp; Lichter, D. L. (2007). Social boundaries and marital assimilation: Interpreting trends in racial and ethnic intermarriage. American Sociological Review, 72, 68-94.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, less than 46% of White Americans are willing to date an individual of any other race.&lt;ref name="Yancey20092"&gt;Yancey, G. (2009). Cross-racial differences in the racial preferences of potential dating partners: A test of the alienation of African Americans and Social Dominance Orientation. The Sociology Quarterly, 50, 121-143.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, African Americans appear to be the most open to interracial relationships,&lt;ref name="Robnett20112"&gt;Robnett, B., &amp; Feliciano, C. (2011). Patterns of racial-ethnic exclusion by internet daters. Social Forces, 89, 807-828.&lt;/ref&gt; yet are the least preferred partner by other racial groups.&lt;ref name="Yancey20092"/&gt; However, regardless of stated preferences, [[Discrimination|racial discrimination]] still occurs in online dating.&lt;ref name="Hitsch2006" /&gt;

Each group significantly prefers to date intra-racially. [[White Americans]] are the least open to interracial dating, and select preferences in the order of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic Americans]], [[Asian Americans]] and then [[African Americans|African American]] individuals last at 60.5%, 58.5% and 49.4% respectively.&lt;ref name="Robnett20112"/&gt; African American preferences follow a similar pattern, with the most preferred partner belonging to the Hispanic group (61%), followed by White individuals (59.6%) and then Asian Americans (43.5%). Both Hispanic and Asian Americans prefer to date a White individual (80.3% and 87.3%, respectively), and both are least willing to date African Americans (56.5% and 69.5%).&lt;ref name="Yancey20092"/&gt; In all significant cases, Hispanic Americans are preferred to Asian Americans, and Asian Americans are significantly preferred over African Americans.&lt;ref name="Robnett20112" /&gt; Hispanic Americans are less likely to be excluded in online dating [[partner preferences|partner preferences]] by whites seeking a partner, as Latinos are often viewed as a racial group that is increasingly assimilating more into White American [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Yancey, G. (2003). Who Is White? Latinos, Asians, And the New Black/nonblack Divide: Lynne Rienner Pub.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to general racism in online dating, there is further exclusion differences between certain genders within racial groups, such that women of any race are significantly less likely to date inter-racially than a male of any race.&lt;ref&gt;Fisman, R., Sheena S. I., Emir K. &amp; Itamar S. (2006). "Gender differences in mate selection: Evidence from a speed dating experiment." Quarterly Journal of Economics, 121, 673-697.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Asian men and Black women face more obstacles to acceptance online.&lt;ref&gt;Spell, S. A. (2016). Not just black and white: how race/ethnicity and gender intersect in hookup culture. Sociology of Race and Ethnicity, 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt; White women are most likely to exclude Asian men, likely due to their amplified [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] portrayal in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, E. (1986). "Asian Americans and American Popular Culture." P. 99-114 in Asian American History Dictionary, edited by R. H. Kim. New York: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Espiritu, Y. L. (1997).

"Lives at the centre of the periphery, lives at the periphery of the centre - Chinese American masculinities and bargaining with hegemony." Gender &amp; Society, 13, 584-607.&lt;/ref&gt; This exclusion remains present even when considering high earning Asian individuals with an advanced educational background.&lt;ref name="Robnett20112" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barringer, H. R., Takeuchi, D. T. &amp; Xenos, P. (1990). "Education, Occupational Prestige, and Income of Asian Americans." Sociology of Education, 63, 27-43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massey, D. S. &amp; Denton, N. A. (1992). "Residential Segregation of Asian-Origin Groups in United-States Metropolitan Areas." Sociology and Social Research, 76, 170-177.&lt;/ref&gt; Increased education does however influence choices in the other direction, such that a higher level of schooling is associated with more optimistic feelings towards interracial relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Bobo, L. D. &amp; Massagli, M. P. (2001). "Stereotyping and Urban Inequality." P. 89-162 in Urban Inequality, edited by a M. P. M. Lawrence D. Bobo. New York: Russell Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; White men are most likely to exclude Black women, as opposed to women of another race. High levels of previous exposure to a variety of racial groups creates a more accepting attitude.&lt;ref&gt;Potârcă, G &amp; Mills, M. (2015). Racial preferences in online dating across European countries. European Sociological Review, 31(3), 326-341.&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual racism in online dating, in addition to the outside world, is also influenced by the partner selectors area of residence. Those residing in more Southern regions, particularly in American states, are less likely to have been in an interracial relationship, and are unlikely to inter-racially date in the future.&lt;ref name="Perry20142"&gt;Perry, S. L. (2014). Religious Socialisation and Interracial Dating: The effects of childhood religious salience, practice, and parents' tradition. Journal of Family Issues, 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Location is also related to the individuals current and previous religious practices; those who engaged in regular religious customs at age 12 are less likely to inter-racially date. Moreover, those from a [[Judaism|Jewish]] background are significantly more likely to enter an interracial relationship than those from a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] background, indicating differences in levels of sexual racism present, which translate into the virtual world of online dating.&lt;ref name="Perry20142" /&gt;

Currently, there are websites specifically targeted to different couple matches, such that singles can sign up online and focus on one particular partner quality, such as race, religious beliefs or ethnicity. In addition to this, there are online dating services that target race-specific partner choices, and a selection of pages dedicated to interracial dating that allow users to select partners based on age, gender and particularly race. Online dating services experience controversy in this context as debate is cast over whether statements such as "no Asians" or "not attracted to Asians" in user profiles, are racist or just signify individual preference.&lt;ref&gt;Callander, D., Newman, C. E. &amp; Holt, M. (2015). Is Sexual Racism Really Racism? Distinguishing Attitudes Toward Sexual Racism and Generic Racism Among Gay and Bisexual Men. Archives of Sexual Behaviour, 44(7), 1991-2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic minorities who feel they lack dating prospects as a result of their race, sometimes refer to themselves as ''ethnicels''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/star-columnists/2018/05/01/the-foundational-misogyny-of-incels-overlaps-with-racism.html|title=The foundational misogyny of incels overlaps with racism - The Star|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Homosexual community ==
[[Asian people|Asian]] men are often represented in media, both mainstream and [[LGBT]], as being feminized and desexualized.{{sfn|Nguyen|2014}} LGBT Asian men often report sexual [[racism]] from [[white people|white]] LGBT men. The [[homosexual|gay]] [[Asian Canadians|Asian-Canadian]] author [[Richard Fung]] has written that while [[black people|black]] men are portrayed as [[sexualization|hypersexualized]], gay Asian men are portrayed as being undersexed.{{sfn|Gross|Woods|1999|pp=235–253}} Fung also wrote about feminizing depictions of Asian men in [[gay pornography]], which often focuses on gay Asian men's submission to the pleasure of white men. According to Fung, gay Asian men tend to ignore or display displeasure with races such as [[Arabs]], blacks, and other Asians but seemingly give sexual acceptance and approval to gay white men. White gay men are more frequently than other racial groups to state "No Asians" when seeking partners. In [[interracial pornography|interracial]] gay male pornography, Asian men are usually portrayed as submissive "[[Top, bottom and versatile#Bottom|bottoms]]".{{sfn|Nguyen|2004|pp=223–228}}

Asian American women also report similar discrimination in lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB) communities. According to a study by Sung, Szymanski, and Henrichs-Beck (2015), Asian American participants who identified as lesbian or bisexual often reported invisibility, stereotyping, and fetishism in LGB circles and the larger U.S. culture. This is in addition to the heterosexism and invisibility they felt in Asian American communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sung|first=Mi Ra|last2=Szymanski|first2=Dawn M.|last3=Henrichs-Beck|first3=Christy|title=Challenges, coping, and benefits of being an Asian American lesbian or bisexual woman.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/sgd0000085|journal=Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity|volume=2|issue=1|pages=52–64|doi=10.1037/sgd0000085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial sexism is also prevalent in gay online dating. Phua and Kaufman (2003) noted that men seeking men online were more likely than men seeking women to look at racial traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phua|first=Voon C.|last2=Kaufman|first2=Gayle|title=The Crossroads of Race and Sexuality: Date Selection among Men in Internet "Personal" Ads|url=http://www.ingentaselect.com/rpsv/cgi-bin/cgi?ini=xref&amp;body=linker&amp;reqdoi=10.1177/0192513X03256607|journal=Journal of Family Issues|volume=24|issue=8|pages=981–994|doi=10.1177/0192513x03256607}}&lt;/ref&gt; Race is often used to advertise oneself or as a criterion in seeking a partner, according to a study looking at Manhunt profiles. In Callander, Newman, and Holt's (2012) study, White participants self-disclosed their racial identity less often than non-White participants, with the implication that Whiteness was the norm and non-Whites expected to self-disclose their racial identity. They cite one profile description as an example: "I shouldn't have to ask for a picture, or your age, or your ethnicity. Have it available straight away or I'll just pass over your profile."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callander|first=Denton|last2=Holt|first2=Martin|last3=Newman|first3=Christy E.|date=2012-10-01|title=Just a preference: racialised language in the sex-seeking profiles of gay and bisexual men|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13691058.2012.714799|journal=Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality|volume=14|issue=9|pages=1049–1063|doi=10.1080/13691058.2012.714799|issn=1369-1058|pmid=22943583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a qualitative study conducted by Paul, Ayala, and Choi (2010) with Asian and Pacific Islanders (API), Latino, and African American men seeking men, participants interviewed endorsed racial preference as a common criteria in online dating partner selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paul|first=Jay P.|last2=Ayala|first2=George|last3=Choi|first3=Kyung-Hee|date=2010-11-02|title=Internet Sex Ads for MSM and Partner Selection Criteria: The Potency of Race/Ethnicity Online|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00224490903244575|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|volume=47|issue=6|pages=528–538|doi=10.1080/00224490903244575|issn=0022-4499|pmc=3065858|pmid=21322176}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the racist power hierarchies often seen in broader spheres of society where Eurocentric discourses are often the standard, and non-Eurocentric discourses are the exceptions.

In another study by Callander, Newman, and Holts, researchers found that attitudes towards sexual racism was often tolerated, with many participants feeling that racial preference was not racism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callander|first=Denton|last2=Newman|first2=Christy E.|last3=Holt|first3=Martin|date=2015-07-07|title=Is Sexual Racism Really Racism? Distinguishing Attitudes Toward Sexual Racism and Generic Racism Among Gay and Bisexual Men|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-015-0487-3|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|language=en|volume=44|issue=7|pages=1991–2000|doi=10.1007/s10508-015-0487-3|issn=0004-0002}}&lt;/ref&gt; They quoted Watts from the Huffington Post, who argued that sexual attraction and racism are not the same:
{{quote|Just because someone isn't sexually attracted to someone of Asian origin does not mean they wouldn't want to work, live next to, or socialize with him or her, or that they believe they are somehow naturally superior to them.|as cited in Callander, Newman, &amp; Holts, 2015, p. 1992}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laurence-watts/gay-racism_b_1307819.html|title=Gay Men And Women Are Not More Racist|last=Author|first=Laurence Watts|last2=News|first2=Features Writer for Pink|date=2012-02-29|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This suggests that people find it possible to view larger systemic racial preference as problematic, while viewing racial preferences in romantic or sexual personal relationships as not problematic. Researchers noted that there is a general hesitation to call racial preference "racist", with many defending racial preference as saving time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In that same study,  researchers found that attitudes towards sexual racism were similar to attitudes about generic racism. That is, patterns of sexual racism seems to follow similar patterns of general racism. For example, they found that higher levels of education was associated with more positive attitudes about multiculturalism and less positive attitudes about racial sexism. They also found that experiences of exclusion online due to race was correlated with more accepting views of multiculturalism and less accepting attitudes about sexual racism, regardless of racial identity. These findings suggest that being more aware of racism in general, due to experience or education, and racism's impact had an effect on racial preference such that it was seen as less desirable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Fetishisation ==
[[File:Asian woman tied in red rope.png|thumb|Asian woman tied in red rope from the [[Folsom Street Fair]] 2007]]
As well as race-based sexual rejection, sexual racism also manifests in the form of the hypersexualisation of specific ethnic groups. Freudians theorize that [[sexual fetishism]], people of one race can form sexual fixations towards individuals of a separate generalised racial group. This collective [[Racial stereotype|stereotype]] is established through the perception that an individual's sexual appeal derives entirely from their race, and is therefore subject to the [[prejudice]]s that follow.

Racial fetishism as a culture is often perceived, in this context, as an act or belief motivated by sexual racism. The objectification and reductionist perception of different races, for example, East Asian women, or African American men, relies greatly on their portrayal in forms of media that depict them as sexual objects. An example of such a medium includes [[pornography]]. An instance of this hypersexualisation is commented upon in Artist and Designer Donna Choi's illustrative series targeting the specific fetishisation of Asian women, named, ''Does Your Man Suffer From Yellow Fever?'' (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.donnachoi.com/work/yellow-fever.html|title=Does Your Man Suffer From Yellow Fever? {{!}} Donna Choi|website=www.donnachoi.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In said illustration, Choi uses satire to depict a white man's harmful perception of a "[[Asian stereotypes|china doll stereotype]]" towards Asian woman and how she is an object to his desires. Choi's intention comes across through implying the presence of an obvious dehumanisation of Asian women in the eyes of another race. This is a deliberate commentary on the fetishisation rooted within the social issue of sexual racism.{{Third-party inline|date=May 2017}}

The effects of Racial Fetishism as a form of Sexual Racism, is discussed in research conducted by Plummer.&lt;ref&gt;Plummer, M. D. (2008). Sexual racism in gay communities: Negotiating the ethnosexual marketplace.&lt;/ref&gt; Plummer used qualitative interviews within given focus groups, and found that specific social locations came up as areas in which sexual racism commonly manifest. These mentioned social locations included pornographic media, gay clubs and bars, [[Casual sex|casual sex encounters]] as well as [[romantic relationship]]s. This high prevalence was recorded within Plummer's research to be consequentially related to the recorded lower self-esteem, internalised sexual racism, and increased psychological distress in participants of colour. People subject to this form of racial discernment are targeted in a manner well put by Hook.&lt;ref&gt;Hook, D. (2005). The racial stereotype, colonial discourse, fetishism, and racism. Psychoanalytic Review, 92(5), 702-734.&lt;/ref&gt; Hook's historical overview of [[J.M. Coetzee|J.M. Coetzee's]] novel, largely addressed Coetzee's depictions of racial otherness within South Africa. Additionally, Coetzee goes on to write about how the otherness and social detachment from the colonials was what fabricated present racial stereotypes. Such stereotypes are what is said to encourage the perception of other racial groups as ''fantasmatic objects''; a degrading and generalising view of different racial populations.

'''Sexual rituals''' fall into two categories: [[culture]]-created, and natural behaviour, the human animal having developed ''[[Human sexual behavior|sex]] rituals'' from evolutionary instincts for [[reproduction]], which are then integrated into [[society]], and elaborated to include aspects such as marriage rites, dances, etc. Arguably indeed, 'sex in its more ritualized and symbolic varieties...has moulded the shape of civilization'.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Morris, ''The Naked Ape Trilogy'' (London 1994) p. 246 and p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes sexual rituals are highly formalized and/or part of religious activity, as in the cases of [[Hieros gamos]], the [[hierodule]] and the [[Ordo Templi Orientis|OTO]]. Contemporary sacred sexual rituals have been tagged as 'structured, symbolic, manifestation, ceremonies, tradition, everyday, habit, grounding, magic, solemn'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boston.sexspirit.net/ss-rituals-script.pdf "Sacred Sexual Rituals" p. 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225001208/http://boston.sexspirit.net/ss-rituals-script.pdf |date=2010-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rites of passage==

Part of the [[rites of passage]] of growing up are what have been termed 'rites of separation from the asexual world...followed by rites of incorporation into the world of sexuality'.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold van Gennep, ''The Rites of Passage'' (1977) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; These may be formal or semi-formal—'for some students, going to college is partly a sexual ritual, like the ceremonial dances of the [[whooping crane]]'&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frue et al, ''Northrop Frye's Writing on Education'' (2000) p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;—or take the form of a more private induction: 'formal and artificial...the impression that a long-established rite was to be enacted, among Staffordshire figurs and ''papier-mâché'' trays, with the compelling, detached formality of nightmare'.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Powell, ''A Buyer's Market'' (1981 )p. 267-8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freud]] was particularly interested in [[Ethnological]] accounts of 'the "ceremonial" (purely formal, ritual, or official) [[coitus]], which takes place' in connection with 'the [[taboo]] of virginity'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 268-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wedding as orgy===

Freud also noted that in 'numerous examples of marriage ceremonies there can be no doubt that people other than the bridegroom, for example his assistants and companions (our traditional "groomsmen"),  granted full sexual access to the bride'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Sexuality'' p. 269n&lt;/ref&gt; To his followers, 'the ''wedding as orgy'', with the bride taking on all the men present, is the clear historical reality behind the modern jokes...and the climactic line-up or "gang"-kissing of the bride, by all the men present'.&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman, ''The Rationale of the Dirty Joke'' Vol II (1973) p. 90-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In such a view, 'other examples of sacred or permitted public coitus of all women with all men do survive, in similarly modified "kissing" form', as under the [[Mistletoe#Culture, folklore, and mythology|mistletoe]] 'to revive the dying sun at the winter solstice, when the strongest human "life-magic", namely ritual intercourse, is to be deployed'.&lt;ref&gt;Legman, ''Rationale'' p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interaction ritual==

To the [[sociologist]] looking upon 'sexual intercourse as interaction ritual...sexual intercourse is the ritual of love; it both creates and recreates the social tie (since [[Durkheim]]ian rituals need to be repeated periodically, as solidarity runs down), and symbolizes it'.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, ''Interaction Ritual Chains'' (Princeton 2004) p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; In similar fashion, [[Margot Anand]] has pointed out that 'rituals pervade our daily life and give it a sense of ceremony and celebration(...)a ritual, through your own unique symbolic gestures...will help you transform your lovemaking into a special and sacred act'.&lt;ref&gt;Margo Anand, ''The Art of Sexual Ecstasy'' (1990) p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erving Goffman]] has noted however 'the considerable informational delicacy of this form of interaction', and how 'individuals may use darkness to ensure strategic ambiguity'.&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (Penguin 1972) p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compulsions==

In [[perversion]], sexual rituals may emerge as a necessary part of sexual activity. For the [[criminologist]], 'sexual ritual involves repeatedly engaging in an act or series of acts in a certain manner because of a sexual need'.&lt;ref&gt;J. E. Douglas et al, ''Crime Classification Manual'' (2006) p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; Within a relationship, 'the Compulsive [[libido]] type takes advantages of opportunities to use the specific sexual ritual that causes intense arousal, and in its stronger form, the Compulsive lover can only arouse using the sexual object or ritual''.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Pertot, ''When Your Sex Drives Don't Match'' (2007) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In any relationship however, 'a sexual habit that becomes routine or stylised...can lead to a sexual ritual', so that 'if you don't have a way to talk to your partner about your sexual relationship, you may find yourself...stuck in sexual rituals that could be limiting your sexual enjoyment':&lt;ref&gt;G. Anderson/B. K. Weinhold, ''Connective Bargaining'' (1981) p. 53 and p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; as a wife might say, '"Same old technique, same old Lewis. It's you all right, I'd know that old routine anywhere'.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Stewart, ''Airs Above the Ground'' (1967) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Thus one's sex life may all 'be about rituals: the ritual of sex in the morning, or the ritual of sex at night; and the ritual of sex at anniversaries, and the ritual of sex at Christmas'.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (1970) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tibetan art==
In the [[Tibetan art|Buddhist art]] of [[India]], [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]] and [[Tibet]], [[yab-yum]] is the male [[deity]] in sexual union with his female [[wikt:consort|consort]]. The symbolism is associated with [[Anuttarayoga tantra]] where the male figure is usually linked to compassion (''{{IAST|karuṇā}}'') and skillful means (''[[upaya|upāya-kauśalya]]''), and the female partner to 'insight' (''prajñā'').&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien. (2003). ''A Dictionary of Buddhism'',  p. 338. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-860560-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbolism of union and sexual polarity is a central teaching in [[Tantric Buddhism]], especially in Tibet. The union is realised by the practitioner as a mystical experience within one's own body.&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann-Pfandt, Adelheid. "Yab Yum Iconography and the Role of Women in Tibetan Tantric Buddhism." ''The Tibet Journal''. Vol. XXII, No. 1. Spring 1997, pp. 12-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Yab-yum is generally understood to represent the primordial (or mystical) union of wisdom and compassion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seriousseekers.com/News%20and%20Articles/pallis_marriagewisdommethod.pdf The Marriage of Wisdom and Method] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617051023/http://www.seriousseekers.com/News%20and%20Articles/pallis_marriagewisdommethod.pdf |date=2011-06-17 }} By Marco Pallis&lt;/ref&gt;

Tantric Buddhism is itself an outcrop of [[Tantra|Tantrism]], advanced techniques of which included 'the ritual sex act ([[Maithuna]]) which was a feature of Tantric yoga'.&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Hoare, ''Yoga'' (London 1977) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Given that 'sex is holy to a Tantric...Tantric art, writings and religious rituals glorify sex'.&lt;ref&gt;K. Devi, in Margo Anand, ''The Art of Sexual Ecstasy'' (1990) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private worship==

A sex organ 'makes an admirable fertility symbol, and has been worshipped as such privately from time to time, or even publicly...gives dramatic promise of productivity and protection'.&lt;ref&gt;Berne, p. 78-80&lt;/ref&gt; Such "worship" may only become more common in [[late modernity]], as 'in our secular culture sexuality often replaces religion as a means of pursuing the meaning of life'.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Sheehy, ''New Passages'' (London 1996) p. 328-9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Watts]] maintains that 'when you are [[falling in love|in love]] with someone, you do indeed see them as a divine being...through a tremendous outpouring of psychic energy in total devotion and worship for this other person'.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, in Anand, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; A woman may 'want someone who adores me...like he was adoring my breasts with his hands'.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Cann, ''Sea Change'' (London 2007) p. 48 and p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; A man (more ambivalently) may muse on 'the white breasts he worships; adores; is scared of; detests'.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Thomas, ''the cheek perforation dance'' (London 2003) p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Shakespeare]], 'this is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity, a green goose a goddess; pure, pure idolatry'.&lt;ref&gt;G. Blakemore Evans ed., ''The Riverside Shakespeare'' (1997) p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

In the further reaches of [[chick lit]], ' the male organ...becomes a tower of strength, a tree trunk in girth, the pillar that sustains the universe...a Pillar of Hercules, sustaining heaven'&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Hemingway, ''Soulfire'' (London 1994) p. 277 and p. 437&lt;/ref&gt;—evidence perhaps that 'the phallic religious tendency is alive in the modern and the civilized...a compulsive fascination'&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Aldrich, ''The Primitive Mind and Modern Civilization'' (1999) p. 153 and p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; with what [[Jung]] termed 'the phallus as the quintessence of life and fruitfulness'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Psychology of the Unconscious'' 9London 1944) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, the Western adept may borrow, in the quest 'to create a Sacred Space...names given to the vagina in the East, including Valley of Joy, Great Jewel, Pearl, Lotus Blossom, Moist Cave, Ripe Peach, Enchanted Garden, and Full Moon'.&lt;ref&gt;Anand, p. 72 and p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==

In the ''[[Satyricon]]'', the hero is throughout 'hounded by the mighty rage of [[Priapus]] of Hellespont'—almost certainly because early on he 'has offended Priapus...by impersonating him in some sexual ceremonies'.&lt;ref&gt;Petronius, ''The Satyricon'' (Penguin 1986) p. 157 and p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''snuff film''', or '''snuff movie''', is "a movie in a purported genre of movies in which a person is actually [[murder]]ed or commits [[suicide]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[American Heritage Dictionary]], ''s.v.''&lt;/ref&gt; It may or may not be made for financial gain, but is supposedly "circulated amongst a jaded few for the purpose of entertainment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Snuff films false |url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/madmen/snuff.asp |date=October 31, 2006 |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some filmed records of executions and murders exist, but in those cases, the death was not specifically staged for financial gain or entertainment.&lt;ref name=snopes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/madmen/snuff.htm|title=Barbara Mikkelson, "A Pinch of Snuff", Snopes.com, 31 Oct 2006, accessed 8 April 2007|work=snopes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first known use of the term ''snuff movie'' is in a 1971 book by [[Ed Sanders]], ''The Family: The Story of Charles Manson's Dune Buggy Attack Battalion''. He alleges that [[Charles Manson|The Manson Family]] was involved in making such a film in California to record their murders.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LloT4dmu7xMC extract from book]&lt;/ref&gt;

The noun ''snuff'' originally meant the part of a candle wick that has already burned; the verb ''snuff'' meant to cut this off, and by extension to extinguish or kill.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 1st ed, 1913&lt;/ref&gt; The word has been used in this sense in English slang for hundreds of years. It was defined in 1874 as a "term very common among the lower orders of London, meaning to die from disease or accident".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Camden Hotten]], ''[[A Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant, and Vulgar Words]]'', 5th edition&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Geoffrey O'Brien]], "whether or not commercially distributed 'snuff' movies actually exist, the possibility of such movies is implicit in the stock [[B-movie]] motif of the mad artist killing his models, as in ''[[A Bucket of Blood]]'' [1959], ''[[Color Me Blood Red]]'' [1965], or ''Decoy for Terror'' [1967]" also known as ''Playgirl Killer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Geoffrey O’Brien|O’Brien, Geoffrey]] |date=1993|title=Horror for Pleasure|work=[[The New York Review of Books]]}} (April 22 issue), n.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of "snuff films" being made for profit became more widely known with the commercial film ''[[Snuff (film)|Snuff]]'' (1976).&lt;ref name="csicop.org"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/snuff_film_the_making_of_an_urban_legend/ |author=Stine, Scott Aaron |title=The Snuff Film: The Making of an Urban Legend |work=Skeptical Inquirer |volume=23.3 |date=1999 |accessdate=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2p7i4oL6Dk |title=Do snuff movies exist? |series=Documentary, part 1 |publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cook, David A. |title=Lost Illusions: American Cinema in The Shadow of Watergate and Vietnam |page=233 |publisher=University of California Press |date=2000 |isbn= 0-520-23265-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This low-budget [[exploitation film|exploitation]] horror film, originally titled ''Slaughter'', was directed by [[Michael and Roberta Findlay]]. In an interview decades later, Roberta Findlay said the film's distributor Allan Shackleton had read about snuff films being imported from [[South America]] and retitled ''Slaughter'' to ''Snuff'', to exploit the idea;&lt;ref name="Press"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nypress.com/article-11831-the-curse-of-her-filmography.html |title=The Curse of Her Filmography: Roberta Findlay's grindhouse legacy |work=New York Press |date=July 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; he also added a new ending that depicted an actress being murdered on a film set.&lt;ref name="Lees"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.martinalees.co.uk/?p=43 |author=Lees, Martina |title=Death robe of secrecy hangs around snuff films |work=Beeld |date=October 18, 2003 |accessdate=December 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303094140/http://www.martinalees.co.uk/?p=43 |archivedate=March 3, 2012 |df=mdy-all }} (originally in [[Afrikaans]])&lt;/ref&gt; The promotion of ''Snuff'' on its second release suggested it featured the murder of an actress: "The film that could only be made in South America... where life is CHEAP",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hawkins, Joan |title=Cutting Edge: Art-Horror and The Horrific Avant-Garde |page=136 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |date=2000 |isbn=0-8166-3413-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt; but that was false advertising.&lt;ref name="Lees" /&gt; Shackleton put out false newspaper clippings that reported a citizens group's crusading against the film&lt;ref name="csicop.org" /&gt; and hired people to act as protesters to picket screenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/23189619/Snuff |title=Snuff |website=Britannica Online Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==False snuff films==

===The ''Guinea Pig'' films===
{{Main article|Guinea Pig (film series)}}
The first two films in the Japanese ''Guinea Pig'' series are designed to look like snuff films; the video is grainy and unsteady, as if recorded by amateurs. The sixth film in the series, ''Mermaid in a Manhole'', allegedly served as an inspiration for Japanese serial killer [[Tsutomu Miyazaki]], who murdered several preschool girls in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, actor [[Charlie Sheen]] became convinced that ''[[Flower of Flesh and Blood]]'' (1985), the second film in the series, depicted an actual homicide and contacted the [[FBI]].&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;  The Bureau initiated an investigation but closed it after the series'  producers released a "making of" film demonstrating the special effects used to simulate the murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=McDowell, R. |title=Movies to Die For|work= The San Francisco Chronicle|date=August 7, 1994|page= A5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Cannibal Holocaust''===
{{Main article|Cannibal Holocaust}}
The Italian director [[Ruggero Deodato]] was charged after rumors that the depictions of the killing of the main actors in his film ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'' (1980) were real. He was able to clear himself of the charges after the actors made an appearance in court.&lt;ref name="In the Jungle"&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Ruggero Deodato (interviewee) |date=2003 | title=In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | medium=Documentary | location=Italy | publisher=Alan Young Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than graphic gore, the film contains several scenes of sexual violence and the genuine deaths of six animals onscreen and one off screen, issues which find ''Cannibal Holocaust'' in the midst of controversy to this day. It has also been claimed that ''Cannibal Holocaust'' is banned in over 50 countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=Cannibal Holocaust 25th Anniversary Edition |orig-year=1980 |others=[[Ruggero Deodato]] |page=back cover |publisher=[[VIPCO (Video Instant Picture Company)]] |location=UK |id=VIP666SE |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this has never been verified. In 2006, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine named ''Cannibal Holocaust'' as the 20th most controversial film of all-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1202224.html | title=The 25 Most Controversial Films of All-Time | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | accessdate=September 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social innovations''' are new [[strategies]], [[concept]]s, [[idea]]s and organizations that aim to meet [[social]] needs resulting from [[working condition]]s, [[education]], [[community development]], and [[health]]. These ideas are created with the goal of extending and strengthening [[civil society]]. Social innovation includes the social ''processes'' of innovation, such as open source methods and techniques and also the [[innovation]]s which have a [[social purpose]]—like [[activism]], [[online volunteering]], [[microcredit]], or [[Distance education|distance learning]].

Prominent innovators associated with the term include Pakistani [[Akhter Hameed Khan]], Bangladeshi [[Muhammad Yunus (economist)|Muhammad Yunus]], the founder of [[Grameen Bank]] which pioneered the concept of [[microcredit]] for supporting innovations in many developing countries such as Asia, Africa and Latin America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Domanski, Monge, Quitiaquez, Rocha|title=Innovación Social en Latinoamérica|date=2016|publisher=Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios|isbn=978-958-763-196-8|url=http://sfs.tu-dortmund.de/Publikationen/Innovacion_Social_en_Latinoamerica.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inspired programs like the [[Infolady Social Entrepreneurship Programme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foreign |first=Mail |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2226809/Info-Ladies-bringing-internet-bike-remote-villages-Bangladesh.html |title=Info Ladies bringing the internet by bike to the remote villages of Bangladesh &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2012-11-02 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asafeworldforwomen.org/global-news/asia/bangladesh/3284-internet-info-ladies.html |title=Internet rolls into Bangladesh villages on a bike |publisher=Asafeworldforwomen.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amaderkotha.com.bd/2012/11/08/info-ladies-riding-internet-into-rural-bangladesh |title=Info Ladies – Riding Internet into Rural Bangladesh! |publisher=Amader Kotha |date=2012-11-08 |accessdate=2014-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317182454/http://amaderkotha.com.bd/2012/11/08/info-ladies-riding-internet-into-rural-bangladesh/ |archivedate=2014-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Dnet (A Social Enterprise)]]. 

==Focus and application==
Social Innovation has an inter-sectoral approach and is universally applicable. Social Innovations are launched by a variety of actors, including research institutions, companies and independent organizations, which tend to use their respective definitions of Social Innovation. Therefore, it is worth discussing what distinguishes it from other forms of social work or [[innovation]]. 

Social Innovation focuses on the process of innovation, how innovation and change take shape (as opposed to the more traditional definition of innovation, giving priority to the internal organization of firms and their productivity). It likewise centers on new work and new forms of cooperation (business models),&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;Klievink, B., &amp; Janssen, M. (2014). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10580530.2014.923268 "Developing multi-layer information infrastructures: advancing social innovation through public-private governance"]  "Information Systems Management" 31:240–249&lt;/ref&gt; especially on those that work towards the attainment of a sustainable society.

The Young Foundation, in order to distinguish between social and business innovation, stressed that social innovation is developed and diffused via organisations, whose primary purposes are not centred on mere profit maximisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Innovation. What it is, why it matters and how it can be accelerated|last=Mulgan|first=Tucker|publisher=The Young Foundation|year=2007|isbn=|location=London|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of European Policy Advisers more precisely defined social innovation as socially oriented in both ends and means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=). Empowering People, Driving Change: Social Innovation in the European Union|last=Hubert|first=A,|publisher=BEPA – Bureau of European Policy Advisers|year=2010|isbn=|location=Brussels|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these influential definitions, social innovation is characterised by: the capacity to address social needs that traditional policy seems increasingly unable to tackle; the empowerment of groups and individuals; and the willingness to change social relations. Hence, social innovation is often presented as a way to increase the quality of social services and their cost-effectiveness, offering equivalent, if not superior, outcomes despite considerable budget constraints.

Social innovation can take place within [[government]]; the for-profit sector, the [[nonprofit]] sector (also known as the third sector), or in the spaces between them. Research has focused on the types of platforms needed to facilitate such cross-sector collaborative social innovation.

[[Social entrepreneurship]], like social enterprise, is typically in the nonprofit sector excluding both for-profit and public organizations. Both social entrepreneurship and social enterprise are important contributions to social innovation by creating social value and introducing new ways of achieving goals. Social entrepreneurship brings "new patterns and possibilities for innovation" and are willing to do things that existing organizations are not willing to do.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"&gt;James A. Phills Jr., Kriss Deiglmeier, &amp; Dale T. Miller "Rediscovering Social Innovation", Stanford Social Innovation Review Fall 2008.[http://innovationsociale.lu/sites/default/files/2008_Rediscovering%20Social%20Innovation_Phills%26al.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social innovation is often an effort of mental [[creativity]] which involves fluency and flexibility from a wide range of disciplines. The act of social innovation in a sector is mostly connected with diverse disciplines within the society. The social innovation theory of 'connected difference' emphasizes three key dimensions to social innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Mulgan. Geoff. [http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/centres/skoll/research/Pages/socialinnovationpaper.aspx "Social Innovation: What it is, why it matters and how it can be accelerated: Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, University of Oxford"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902021840/http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/centres/skoll/research/Pages/socialinnovationpaper.aspx |date=2012-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First, innovations are usually new combinations or hybrids of existing elements, rather than completely new. Second, their practice involves cutting across organizational or disciplinary boundaries. Lastly, they leave behind compelling new relationships between previously separate individuals and groups.&lt;ref&gt;Nambisan, S. [http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/platforms_for_collaboration "Platforms for Collaboration"], Stanford Social Innovation Review, Summer 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Social innovation is also gaining visibility within academia.&lt;ref&gt;Howaldt, J./ Schwarz, M.
[http://www.internationalmonitoring.de/fileadmin/Downloads/Trendstudien/Trends_V2/IMO-MAG%20Howaldt_final_mit_cover.pdf "Social Innovation: Concepts, research fields and international trends"], IMO international monitoring, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014, a subdomain of social innovation has been defined in relation to the introduction of digital technologies. The subdomain is called digital social innovation and refers to "a type of social and collaborative innovation in which innovators, users and communities collaborate using digital technologies to co-create knowledge and solutions for a wide range of social needs and at a scale and speed that was unimaginable before the rise of the Internet".&lt;ref&gt;F. Bria, DSI4EU final report, 2015, available at: http://www.nesta.org.uk/sites/default/files/dsireport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Social innovation was discussed in the writings of figures such as [[Peter Drucker]] and [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]] (founder of the [[Open University]] and dozens of other organizations) in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;see for example Gavron, Dench e ds ''Young at 80'', Carcanet Press, London, 1995 for a comprehensive overview of one of the world's most successful social innovators&lt;/ref&gt; It also appeared in the work of French writers in the 1970s, such as [[Pierre Rosanvallon]], [[Jacques Fournier]], and [[Jacques Attali]].&lt;ref&gt;Chambon, J.-L, David, A. and Devevey, J.-M (1982), Les Innovations Sociales, Presses Universitaires de France, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; However, the themes and concepts in social innovation existed long before. [[Benjamin Franklin]], for example, talked about small modifications within the social organization of communities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leaonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15326934CRJ1402_11 |title=Mumford, M.D. (2002) Social Innovation: Ten Cases from Benjamin Franklin, '&amp;#39;Creativity Research Journal'&amp;#39;, 14(2), 253-266 |publisher=Leaonline.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; that could help to solve everyday problems. Many radical 19th century [[reform]]ers like [[Robert Owen]], founder of the cooperative movement, promoted innovation in the social field and all of the great sociologists including [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] focused attention on broader processes of [[social change]].  Other theories of innovation became prominent in the 20th century, many of which had social implications, without putting social progress at the center of the theory. [[Joseph Schumpeter]], for example, addressed the process of [[innovation]] directly with his theory of [[creative destruction]] and his definition of entrepreneurs as people who combined existing elements in new ways to create a new product or service. Beginning in the 1980s, writers on technological change increasingly addressed how social factors affect technology diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;notably in the writings of [[Christopher Freeman]], Carlotta Perez, Ian Miles and others&lt;/ref&gt;

The article "Rediscovering Social Innovation" mentions how social innovations are dependent on history and the change in institutions. The article discusses the ten recent social innovations reflecting current change to include:
* '''Charter Schools:''' Charter schools are a social innovation that provides an alternative avenue for students to continue to develop and build upon their educational foundation without many of the issues prominent in the public school system. These primary and secondary schools are publicly funded and operate independently, which allows the teachers and parents to collaboratively develop alternative teaching methods for their students as related regulations are less stringent for Charter Schools.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Charter School." Wikipedia. Wikimedia Foundation, n.d. Web. Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Community-Centered Planning:''' This social innovation allows communities to plan and develop systems that cater solutions to their specific local needs by using their historical knowledge and other local resources.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Emissions Trading:''' The Emissions Trading program was designed to address issues associated with the continuous increase in pollution. The program provides solutions such as setting a cap on the amount that certain pollutants can be emitted, and implementing a permit system to control the amount of pollution produced by each participating business. If a business needs to use more pollution than permitted, it can purchase credits from a business that has not emitted its maximum permitted amount. The goal of the Emissions Trading program is that, over time and with increased awareness, society will limit the types and the numbers of pollutants emitted to what is only necessary.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Fair Trade:''' Products including coffee, sugar, and chocolate are currently being traded without high standards that result in tough conditions for farmers and a less sustainable environment. Fair trade is a movement that certifies traders to exchange with the farmers that produce these products. The idea behind this movement is that by being paid a living-wage, being able to meet social and environmental standards and promoting "environmental sustainability, the lives of these farmers will be improved.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Habitat Conservation Plans:''' Habitat Conservation Plans is an effort by the US Fish and Wild Life Service and the Environmental Protection Agency to protect species and their endangerment by providing economical incentives to conserve their habitats and protect these species from endangerment.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Individual Development Accounts:''' This social innovation is made to support the working poor with saving decisions that they have made to better enhance their lives. This initiative will give $2 per every $1 saved by the working poor for College tuition, purchasing a home, starting a business, and other similar and productive initiatives. This is made possible by philanthropic, government and corporate sponsors that donate to this cause.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''International Labor Standards:''' Labor standards differ country-to-country, with some agreeably better than others. In effort to internationally align these, the International Labor Organization, participating governments, and employees contributed to the development of standards that protect workers’ rights to freedom, equity, security, and human dignity".&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Microfinance:''' This social innovation is created to support those financially unable to gain access to financial services such as banking, lending, and insurance. The ultimate goal of Microfinance is to enable an escape from poverty by helping to improve the living conditions and financial viability among the impoverished program participants.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Socially Responsible Investing:''' "An investment strategy that attempts to maximize both financial and social returns. Investors generally favor businesses and other organizations whose practices support environmental sustainability, human rights, and consumer protection."&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Supported Employment:''' Supported Employment is a social innovation geared towards helping disabled or disadvantaged workers who are un- or under-employed due to their condition obtain suitable employment. The Support Employment service provides access to job coaches, transportation, assistive technology, specialized job training, and individual tailored supervision in effort to help program participants become more competitive applicants and better prepared overall for the job market.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
Over the last two decades social innovation has gained significant popularity as a strategy to tackle new social risks including population ageing and its health correlates (Hubert, 2010; Mulgan et al., 2007, 2010; Murray, Caulier-Grice and Mulgan, 2010). However, as other concepts recently developed within the academic debate – among them, [[social capital]] (Ferragina, 2012) – social innovation might soon turn out to be simply another way to juxtapose the qualifier "social" to the private sector jargon, in order to avoid heated discussions on structural inequalities (Grisolia and Ferragina, 2015).&lt;ref name="Grisolia and Ferragina 2000"&gt;Grisolia, Francesco and Ferragina, Emanuele. (2015), "Social Innovation on the Rise: yet another buzzword in a time of austerity?" (Salute e società, Vol. 1(2015), pp. 169-179).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of ‘neoliberal austerity’, a strong call in favour of social innovation might hide the attempt to shift public attention from structural deficiencies and disparities to individual and group responsibility, following the vision: "doing more with less". In order to guarantee universal coverage and universal social rights, however, the welfare state system cannot be managed with the logic of mere cost-effectiveness alone (Grisolia and Ferragina, 2015).&lt;ref name="Grisolia and Ferragina 2000"/&gt; A Universal coverage is the precondition for any well-functioning economy, not the other way around. As such, the enhancement of "politically motivated policies under the pretence of budget cuts" can be particularly dangerous in its consequences for population health (Kleinert and Horton, 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;1074). Social innovation per se might not be able to substantially tackle pressing social needs. Rather, the all-innovating and self-empowering jargon currently in vogue might disguise a dangerous inattention to structural inequalities, adversely affecting health outcomes across the board, but especially of the poorest. Among the therapies prescribed by the neoliberal orthodoxy – liberalisation, deregulation, devolution, individual or group empowerment – social innovation might soon reveal itself as a convenient buzzword, an eclectic concept to dissimulate political choices, legitimated by the doctrine of budgetary constraints.&lt;ref name="Grisolia and Ferragina 2000"/&gt; The redistribution of resources "from past to present generations" – keeping constant the overall public spending – and the shift from a "transfer-based" to a "service-based" welfare state would represent a truly innovative approach to social policy, offering a credible and responsible alternative to the magic wand of social innovation.

== Developments since 2000 ==
Academic research, [[blogs]] and websites feature social innovation, along with organizations working on the boundaries of research and practical action. Topics include:

===Institutional support===
The US created an Office for Social Innovation in the White House, which is funding projects that combine public and private resources.&lt;ref name=economist810/&gt; with foundations that support social innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Kohli, J. and Geoff Mulgan (2007) [http://www.youngfoundation.org/publications/reports/capital-ideas-july-2010 Capital Ideas. How to Generate Innovation in the Public Sector]. The Young Foundation and Center for American Progress&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the US government listed 11 investments made by its '[[Social Innovation Fund]]', with public funding more than matched by philanthropic organizations. This fund focuses on partnerships with charities, social enterprises, and business.&lt;ref name="economist810"&gt;{{cite news

In addition to pioneered efforts by institutions such as the Harvard Business School's Initiative on Social Enterprise (launched 1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbs.edu/socialenterprise/ |title=The Social Enterprise Initiative at Harvard Business School |publisher=Hbs.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Said Business School's Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship (launched 2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/ideas-impact/skoll |title=The Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, Said Business School, University of Oxford |publisher=Sbs.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  INSEAD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/centres/social_entrepreneurship/ |title=INSEAD Social Entrepreneurship Programme |publisher=Insead.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other universities now offer short-term programs in Social Innovation, and a few such as [https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/programmes/professional-practice/mst-social-innovation/ Cambridge Judge Business School], University of Cambridge and Goldsmiths, University of London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/ma-social-entrepreneurship/ |title=The Goldsmiths MA Programme in Social Entrepreneurship, University of London |publisher=Gold.ac.uk |date=2014-04-16 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer Masters courses dedicated entirely to the study of theory and practice in relation to social entrepreneurship and innovation.

Public policy makers support social innovation in the UK, Australia, China and Denmark, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Mulgan, Ali, Tucker; ''Social innovation: what it is, why it matters, how it can be accelerated, published by Said Business School, Oxford, 2007''&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union’s innovation strategy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/innovation-union/index_en.cfm |title=Home page - Innovation Union - European Commission |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2014-05-13 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first well-funded research and development strategy to emphasize social innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, R., Caulier- Grice and Geoff Mulgan (2010) [http://www.youngfoundation.org/publications/reports/the-open-book-social-innovation-march-2010 The Open Book of Social Innovation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008044055/http://www.youngfoundation.org/publications/reports/the-open-book-social-innovation-march-2010 |date=2010-10-08 }}. The Young Foundation and NESTA&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the South Australian government, led by Premier and Social Inclusion Minister Mike Rann, embraced a ten-year social innovation strategy with big investments and a focus on reform in areas such as homelessness, school retention, mental health and disability services.

The Common Ground&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commonground.org.au&lt;/ref&gt; and Street to Home homelessness initiatives and the Australian Centre for Social Innovation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tacsi.org,au&lt;/ref&gt; were established in Adelaide and many reforms trialed in South Australia have been adopted nationally throughout Australia. This initiative, headed by Monsignor David Cappo, South Australia's Social Inclusion Commissioner, was advised by 'Thinkers in Residence' [[Geoff Mulgan]] and New York social entrepreneur [[Rosanne Haggerty]].

== Role in curbing corruption ==
Lin and Chen, in "The Impact of Societal and Social innovation: a case-based approach" have argued that social innovation's goal is to produce actions that are "socially valuable and good for many".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/956953682|title=The impact of societal and social innovation : a case-based approach|last=Yeh-Yun,|first=Lin, Carol|others=Chen, Jeffrey,|isbn=9789811017667|location=Singapore|oclc=956953682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In governance, its main role is to enhance and maximize the trust of citizens through active involvement in society, whether in the public or private sphere.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Social innovation's role in curbing corruption is carried out through two main mediums. Firstly, it is institutionalized through actors (in the public and the private sectors), and secondly, it is executed with new tools available, specifically ICTs.

=== Public participation, governmental action and the private sector against corruption ===

==== Grassroots involvement ====
"Corruption cannot be tackled from the top, it has to be confronted from the grassroots"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/06/corruption-confronted-grassroots-john-githongo-kenya|title='Corruption has to be confronted from the grassroots' {{!}} Madeleine Bunting|last=Bunting|first=Madeleine|date=2011-05-06|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[John Githongo]], a Kenyan member of [[Transparency International]]. The Stanford Social Innovation Review develops that grassroots innovations emerge through a combination of social and ethical capital. That is especially true when the system in which they lie fails to accommodate to people's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/tapping_the_entrepreneurial_potential_of_grassroots_innovation|title=Tapping the Entrepreneurial Potential of Grassroots Innovation (SSIR)|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fight against corruption, individuals or groups of citizens have used their position to lead battles against corruption. An example is the case of RosPil.net, a [[crowdsourcing]] website relying on anonymous tips and alerts to uncover and expose corruption in Russia,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://carnegie.ru/2010/12/08/navalny-effect-rospil.net-pub-42105|title=The Navalny Effect: RosPil.net|last=Petrov|first=Nikolay|work=Carnegie Moscow Center|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; whether in the private or the public sector. The collective action permits a growing flow of information and offers, on a daily basis, around three promising tip-offs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another example is the initiative Agenda Pública, a Civil Society [[Civil society organisation|Organisation]], which is paving way for transparent governance in Brazil by relying on the education of the country's public administrators,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/06/where-inequality-persists-social-entrepreneurs-can-step-in-to-bridge-the-gap/|title=Where inequality persists, social entrepreneurs can step in to bridge the gap|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically in more remote and isolated rural areas. Agenda Pública trained more than 5,000 administrators in policy development and basic infrastructure, in order to promote effective parameters for transparency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They do so by making sure that environmental needs and basic financial, education and overall health are met to circumvent bribing.

===== Women and corruption =====
A [[UNDP]] study conducted amongst women grassroots organization around the world demonstrated that "79% of women are better able to stand up against corruption if affiliated with a community group".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/Democratic%20Governance/Anti-corruption/Grassroots%20women%20and%20anti-corruption.pdf|title=Grassroots, Women and Anti-Corruption|last=UNDP|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another poll suggested that electing women into power in countries heavily affected by corruption should be strongly accompanied by an affiliation to a mobilized grassroots women's group. Moreover, 83% of female respondents gave preferences to organized women's leadership to pursue anti-corruption policies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Innovation lies mainly in the introduction of programmes facilitating access to information as well as a governance agenda designed to augment women's engagement in [[participatory monitoring]].

==== Private sector ====
Rich and Moberg in "Beyond Governments" claim that companies need to take the largest step against corruption and must engage in collective governance in order to include public policy and standards in their core business. It would be way to promote good practices, specifically socially responsible investing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781351286077|title=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|website=www.taylorfrancis.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in 2006, the corporate sector fully funded and instigated the creation and development of the Business Code of Conduct for Combating Corruption in Malawi. It is considered an anti-corruption task force which works hand in hand with local groups, members of governments, civil society and the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/august-2010/african-business-ending-corruption-%E2%80%98priority-number-one%E2%80%99|title=For African business, ending corruption is ‘priority number one’ {{!}} Africa Renewal Online|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Governmental action ====
Anderson, Wu and Cho argue that good governance and its benefits can be extrapolated through effective e-governance. The simplification of administrative task and open data transparency, coupled with a clear policy on corruption can have a substantial impact.They also advocate for the strengthening of the delivery of services by the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/934513454|title=E-government strategy, ICT and innovation for citizen engagement|others=Anderson, Dennis (College teacher),, Wu, Robert (College teacher),, Cho, June-Suh, 1966-, Schroeder, Katja (Social media strategist),|isbn=9781493933501|location=New York, NY|oclc=934513454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the government introduced in 2016 the Open Government National Action Plan with one of the main aim being improved transparency. One of the main commitments is the establishment of an Anti-Corruption Innovation Hub. It is the use of social innovation to mobilize social actors and entrepreneurs against corruption. It is perceived that it will "catalyze and connect [an] innovation approach" while promoting the sharing of good practices.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-open-government-national-action-plan-2016-18/uk-open-government-national-action-plan-2016-18#commitment-4-anti-corruption-innovation-hub|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their plan of action has been supported by Switzerland, Indonesia, Spain, Georgia, Australia, the UAE, France and Norway.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In Kosovo, Support to Anti-Corruption Efforts in Kosovo (SAEK) has been developed in order to strengthen the capacities of the Kosovo Anti-Corruption Agency (KAA). They are using innovative [[Information and communications technology|ICT]], web2.0 and social media technologies as a way to connect the government and younger generations by utilizing the potential of new technologies as well as "giving citizens the opportunity to voice concerns, share observations online and to make these visible to the public while raising the awareness  on the level and form of corruption occurring in Kosovo".&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://undp.akvoapp.org/en/project/936/|title=Support to Anti-Corruption Efforts in Kosovo|last=UNDP|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAEK is considered a success as in the year it was launched, more than 1024 cases of corruption were reported (with half of them now resolved).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Information and communications technology as a tool for transparency ===
According to the Inter-Agency Task Force on Financing for Development (part of the [[United Nations]]): "in addition to being an important technology sector in its own right, information and communication technology (ICT) is important for linking agents in the innovation system".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://developmentfinance.un.org/promoting-information-and-communication-technology-access-to-technology-for-all-and-social-innovation|title=Promoting information and communication technology, access to technology for all and social innovation {{!}} Inter-agency Task Force on Financing for Development|website=developmentfinance.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Open data and data mining ====
Open data is currently arising as a corruption-fighting mechanism. Indeed, as transparency in government data increases and becomes accessible to all, there will be opportunities for better accountability as it will increase the odds of uncovering governmental misconduct (specifically in government activities, budgets and expenditures for citizens). Its applications are various, including but not restricted to: following the money, open contracting, changing incentives and enabling cross-sector collaboration.

In 2015, one of the [[G20]] priorities was to reduce corruption and to promote good governance.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.g20.utoronto.ca/2015/G20-Anti-Corruption-Open-Data-Principles.pdf|title=G20 Anti-Corruption Open Data Principles|last=G20|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anti-Corruption Working Group (ACWG) developed the Anti-Corruption Open Data Principles in order to leverage open data as one of the key actions to create and foster accountability and transparency. The principles are directly derived from the International Open Data Charter, which specifies the release and use of government data to reduce the reach of corruption.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Transparency International]] and the Web Foundation carried out a study on certain member countries of the G20 (Brazil, France, Germany, Indonesia and South Africa) to evaluate the effect of the principles on their fight against corruption.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/open_data_and_the_fight_against_corruption_in_indonesia|title=TI Publication - Open data and the fight against corruption in Indonesia|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|website=www.transparency.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia, for example ([[Corruption in Indonesia]]), it is estimated that corruption has cost up to IDR 31,077 trillion to the country.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Through public information availability, the country has tried to foster and promote its anti-corruption actions by utilizing its legal and institutional frameworks. Nonetheless, the access to datasets remains scarce while the lack of education amongst staff and citizens impedes the use of data as a tool against corruption.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[Data mining]] was a crucial tool used in the famous anti-corruption investigation of the [[Panama Papers]] by way of the initiative of the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/|title=The Panama Papers: Exposing the Rogue Offshore Finance Industry - ICIJ|work=ICIJ|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of data reached was 2.6 terabytes or 11.5 billion documents.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The implementation of a [[graph database]] allowed for better efficiency in the research and analysis of the documents as it found hidden links between accounts and owners that would have been hard to dig up otherwise. Mar Cabra, ICIJ Data Editor, claimed that the software used made them feel like: "we [had] superpowers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Neo4j|title=How the ICIJ Used Neo4j to Unravel the Panama Papers|date=2016-05-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAlu3ud2k_A|accessdate=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social media ====
[[Social media]] is amongst the newest factors that has been shown by researchers to reduce the impact of corruption.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/968551831|title=Political scandal, corruption, and legitimacy in the age of social media|others=Çakır-Demirhan, Derya,, Demirhan, Kamil,|isbn=9781522520191|location=Hershey, Pennsylvania|oclc=968551831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media platforms have created a multi-way communication which contradicts the one-way channel of traditional media. It enables individuals to share experiences in a quick and cheap manner through its platforms. It facilitates exchanges of geographically separated individuals which makes it an important tool as a dialogue platform.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In many countries, cases of human rights violations and corruption have started to come out publicly. They challenge the status quo of the government holding the monopoly over information.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The World Economic Forum established in 2014 that social media could be a useful tool to drive anti-corruption because of its ability to advance commentary and information provision to the population.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2014/12/how-to-use-social-media-to-fight-corruption/|title=How to use social media to fight corruption|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also useful because of its key role in investigating through collective action participation. They use the example of I Paid A Bribe, an Indian website inviting users to input their daily contact with corruption and whether they paid a bribe or not to a public servant.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Mobile banking ====
[[Petty corruption]] can be fought by the emergence of cashless payments, and more generally in a cashless economy.

In Kenya, [[M-Pesa]] was launched to allow people to transfer money through mobile phones.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/21/africa/mpesa-10th-anniversary/index.html|title=M-Pesa: Kenya's mobile success story turns 10|last=CNN|first=Kieron Monks,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used by almost two-thirds of the population and is gaining momentum as it is opening its technology to other countries (Tanzania for example).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

As traffic police is seen as one of the most notorious sources of corruption,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000189201/i-saw-traffic-officers-extort-bribes-president-tells-top-police-bosses|title=I saw traffic officers extort bribes, President tells top police bosses|last=Reporter|first=Standard|work=The Standard|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; M-Pesa proposed to create cashless payments on public buses to avoid the extortion of bribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-28106004|title=Kenya's buses to go cashless|date=2014-07-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are currently some logistical and regulatory problems preventing it from getting traction, [[mobile banking]] is seen as a potential tool to fight petty corruption, specifically if it is accompanied by the proper framework for legislative action and [[good governance]].
==Local and regional development==
Literature on social innovation in relation to territorial/[[Regional development|regional]] development covers innovation in the [[social economy]], i.e. strategies for satisfaction of human needs; and innovation in the sense of transforming and/or sustaining [[social relations]], especially [[governance]] relations at the regional and local level. Beginning in the late 1980s, Jean-Louis Laville and [[Frank Moulaert]] researched social innovation.&lt;ref name="Laville, J 1994"&gt;Laville, J.-L. (Ed.) (1994) L’économie solidaire, une perspective internationale, Desclée de Brouwer, Paris&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylorandfrancis.metapress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;eissn=1360-0591&amp;volume=37&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=289 |title=Moulaert, F. and Sekia, F. (2003) Territorial Innovation Models: a Critical Survey, '&amp;#39;Regional Studies'&amp;#39;, 37(3), 289-302 |publisher=Taylorandfrancis.metapress.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada]] CRISES&lt;ref name="CRISES"&gt;[http://www.crises.uqam.ca/pages/en/ CRISES] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214164731/http://www.crises.uqam.ca/pages/en/ |date=December 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; initiated this type of research. Another, larger project was SINGOCOM&lt;ref name="users.skynet.be"&gt;[http://users.skynet.be/bk368453/singocom/index2.html Social Innovation, Governance, and Community Building] (2002–2004)&lt;/ref&gt; a [[European Commission]] [[FP5|Framework 5]] project, which pioneered so-called "Alternative Models for Local Innovation" (ALMOLIN). These models were further elaborated through community actions covered by KATARSIS&lt;ref name="KATARSIS Homepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://katarsis.ncl.ac.uk/ |title=KATARSIS Homepage |publisher=Katarsis.ncl.ac.uk |date=2009-10-07 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SOCIAL POLIS.&lt;ref name="Social Polis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialpolis.eu/ |title=Social Polis |publisher=Socialpolis.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent works focus on the societal role of the economic life in terms of innovations in social practices and social relations at the local and regional levels. Social Innovation, therefore, is increasingly seen as a process and a strategy to foster human development through solidarity, cooperation, and cultural diversity.&lt;ref name="MacCallum, D. 2009"&gt;MacCallum, D., Moulaert, F., Hillier, J. and S. Vicari (Eds) (2009) ''Social Innovation and Territorial Development''. Ashgate, Aldershot. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-7233-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masselin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Masselin |first=Matthieu |url=http://www.paristechreview.com/2011/12/16/social-innovation-future-economy/ |title='&amp;#39;Is Social Innovation the Future of Economy?'&amp;#39;, ParisTech Review, Dec. 2011 |publisher=Paristechreview.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU funded URBACT programme is designed to help cities to exchange and learn around urban policies.  The URBACT methodology can be seen as a social innovation action planning approach. A typical URBACT network would have ten cities working on a specific theme such as active inclusion or regenerating disadvantaged neighbourhoods.  They examine good practice and then working through a local support group use the results to inform their local action plan.&lt;ref&gt;Jegou F., Bonneau M., (2015) [http://urbact.eu/sites/default/files/03_socialinn-web.pdf Social Innovation in Cities - Urbact II Capitalisation.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Social Innovation Europe&lt;ref name="Socialinnovationeurope.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialinnovationeurope.eu |title=Home &amp;#124; Social Innovation Europe |publisher=Socialinnovationeurope.eu |date=2014-05-15 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; initiative, funded by the European Commission's Directorate General for Enterprise and Industry, was set up to map social innovation at a European level, by creating a directory of grass-roots examples of social innovation from across the 27 member states.

The European Commission funded the SELUSI study between 2008 - 2013 that looked at over 550 social ventures and examined how these insights can spark change and innovation at a much larger scale. It looked at business models of social ventures in five countries - UK being one of them – identifying which specific practices evolved by social ventures are particularly successful, and how and by whom – be it social enterprise, public sector body or mainstream business – they can be most effectively scaled-up.

The European Commission has launched a new initiative (project) in 2013 under FP7 funding, with the aim to build a network of incubators for social innovation across regions and countries. This network facilitates identification of 300 social innovation examples and facilitates its scaling. The network is organised in a way to identify new models for scaling of social innovations across various geographical clusters in collaboration with each other, communicating the ideas, finding the tools and funds, developing business plans and models in order to promote the new promising ideas throughout Europe.

* A guide also exists that provides a way to promote social innovations at a local or regional level.&lt;ref name="s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu"&gt;''The Guide to Social Innovation''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1098">'''Technological escalation''' describes the situation where two parties in competition tend to employ continual technological improvements in their attempt to defeat each other.  Technology is defined here as a creative invention, either in the form of an object or a methodology. An example is the mutual escalation seen between [[e-mail spam]]mers and the programmers of spam filters and other anti-spam techniques. Although [[Conflict escalation|escalation]] is usually meant negatively, if two companies are in an escalating competition to produce the best [[Widget (economics)|widget]], the consumer benefits because they get a choice between better and better widgets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23422">'''Technological utopianism''' (often called '''techno-utopianism''' or '''technoutopianism''') is any [[ideology]] based on the premise that advances in science and technology could and should bring about a [[utopia]], or at least help to fulfill one or another utopian ideal.

A '''techno-utopia''' is therefore an ideal [[society]], in which laws, government, and social conditions are solely operating for the benefit and well-being of all its citizens, set in the near- or far-[[future]], as advanced science and technology will allow these ideal living standards to exist; for example, [[post-scarcity]], [[Trans-human|transformations in human nature]], the avoidance or prevention of suffering and even the [[immortality|end of death]].

Technological utopianism is often connected with other discourses presenting technologies as agents of social and cultural change, such as [[technological determinism]] or [[Media imaginary|media imaginaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Natale|first=Simone|last2=Balbi|first2=Gabriele|date=2014-04-03|title=Media and the Imaginary in History|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13688804.2014.898904|journal=Media History|volume=20|issue=2|pages=203–218|doi=10.1080/13688804.2014.898904|issn=1368-8804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Douglas Rushkoff]], a leading theorist on [[technology]] and [[cyberculture]] claims that technology gives everyone a chance to voice their own opinions, fosters individualistic thinking, and dilutes hierarchy and power structures by giving the power to the people.&lt;ref&gt;Rushkoff, Douglas. EME: Explorations in Media Ecology, “Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative”. Hampton Press, 2002, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; He says that the whole world is in the middle of a new Renaissance, one that is centered on technology and self-expression. However, Rushkoff makes it clear that “people don’t live their lives behind a desk with their hands on a keyboard” &lt;ref&gt;Rushkoff, Douglas. “Douglas Rushkoff - Articles - 21st Century Renaissance.” Douglas Rushkoff - Articles - 21st Century Renaissance. Web. 02 March 2015. http://www.rushkoff.com/articles-individual/2008/3/31/21st-century-renaissance.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A tech-utopia does not disregard any problems that technology may cause,&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Howard P. Imagining Tomorrow: History, Technology and The American Future, "The Technological Utopians", Cambridge: MIT Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; but strongly believes that technology allows mankind to make social, economic, political, and cultural advancements.&lt;ref&gt;Rushkoff, Douglas. EME: Explorations in Media Ecology, “Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative”. Hampton Press, 2002, p. 41-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Technological Utopianism views technology’s impacts as extremely positive.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, several ideologies and movements, such as the [[cyberdelic]] counterculture, the [[Californian Ideology]], [[transhumanism]],&lt;ref name="Hughes 2003"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Hughes, James | title = Rediscovering Utopia | year=  2003 | url = http://archives.betterhumans.com/Columns/Column/tabid/79/Column/232/Default.aspx  | accessdate=2007-02-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204653/http://archives.betterhumans.com/Columns/Column/tabid/79/Column/232/Default.aspx |archivedate = 2007-09-27 | authorlink = James Hughes (sociologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[singularitarianism]], have emerged promoting a form of techno-utopia as a reachable goal. Cultural critic [[Imre Szeman]] argues technological utopianism is an irrational [[metanarrative|social narrative]] because there is no evidence to support it. He concludes that it shows the extent to which [[Modernity|modern]] societies place faith in [[Idea of Progress|narratives of progress and technology]] overcoming things, despite all evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily.com"&gt;{{Cite news |title=People Generally Do Not Act on Information on the Effects of Oil on the Environment |date=May 28, 2010 |accessdate=17 Nov 2010 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100528150833.htm |work=ScienceDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===From the 19th to mid-20th centuries===

[[Karl Marx]] believed that [[science]] and [[democracy]] were the right and left hands of what he called the move from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom. He argued that advances in science helped delegitimize the rule of kings and the power of the [[Christian Church]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"&gt;{{cite book| author = Hughes, James | title = Citizen Cyborg: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future | publisher = Westview Press | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8133-4198-1 | authorlink = James Hughes (sociologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

19th-century [[Classical liberalism|liberals]], [[Socialism|socialists]], and [[Republicanism|republicans]] often embraced techno-utopianism. [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicals]] like [[Joseph Priestley]] pursued scientific investigation while advocating democracy. [[Robert Owen]], [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]] in the early 19th century inspired [[Communalism|communalists]] with their visions of a future scientific and [[technological evolution]] of humanity using reason. Radicals seized on [[Darwinism|Darwinian evolution]] to validate the idea of [[social progress]]. [[Edward Bellamy]]’s [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]] in ''[[Looking Backward]]'', which inspired hundreds of socialist clubs in the late 19th century [[United States]] and a national political party, was as highly technological as Bellamy’s imagination. For Bellamy and the [[Fabian Society|Fabian Socialist]]s, socialism was to be brought about as a painless corollary of industrial development.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

Marx and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] saw more pain and conflict involved, but agreed about the inevitable end. [[Marxism|Marxists]] argued that the advance of technology laid the groundwork not only for the creation of a new society, with [[Mutualism (economic theory)|different property relations]], but also for the emergence of new human beings reconnected to nature and themselves. At the top of the agenda for [[Empowerment|empowered]] [[proletarian]]s was "to increase the total [[productive forces]] as rapidly as possible". The 19th and early 20th century Left, from [[Social democracy|social democrats]] to [[Communism|communists]], were focused on [[industrialization]], [[economic development]] and the promotion of reason, science, and the idea of [[Progress (history)|progress]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

Some technological utopians promoted [[eugenics]]. Holding that in studies of families, such as the [[The Jukes family|Jukes]] and [[Kallikaks]], science had proven that many traits such as criminality and alcoholism were hereditary, many advocated the sterilization of those displaying negative traits. Forcible sterilization programs were implemented in several states in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Haller, Mark ''Eugenics: Hereditarian attitudes in American thought'' (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H.G. Wells]] in works such as ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'' promoted technological utopianism.

The horrors of the 20th century – namely fascist dictatorships and the world wars – caused many to abandon optimism. The [[Holocaust]], as [[Theodor Adorno]] underlined, seemed to shatter the ideal of [[Condorcet]] and other thinkers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which commonly equated [[scientific progress]] with social progress.&lt;ref name="Adorno1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adorno|first=Theodor W.|title=Prisms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f1y_dX04yBgC|accessdate=31 March 2011|date=29 March 1983|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-51025-7|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===From late 20th and early 21st centuries===

A movement of techno-utopianism began to flourish again in the [[dot-com company|dot-com]] culture of the 1990s, particularly in the West Coast of the United States, especially based around [[Silicon Valley]]. The [[Californian Ideology]] was a set of beliefs combining [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] and [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] attitudes from the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] with techno-utopianism and support for [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] economic policies. It was reflected in, reported on, and even actively promoted in the pages of ''[[Wired Magazine|Wired]]'' magazine, which was founded in San Francisco in 1993 and served for a number years as the "bible" of its adherents.&lt;ref name="Borsook 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Borsook, Paulina|authorlink = Paulina Borsook|title = Cyberselfishness|year = 1996|url = https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/1996/07/borsook.html?welcome=true|accessdate = 2007-02-06|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125249/https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/1996/07/borsook.html?welcome=true|archivedate = 2007-09-29|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"&gt;{{cite book|author = Borsook, Paulina|title = Cyberselfish: A Critical Romp Through the Terribly Libertarian Culture of High-Tech| publisher = PublicAffairs|year = 2000|isbn = 1-891620-78-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Barbrook, Richard |author2=Cameron, Andy |title = The California Ideology|year = 2000 |url = http://www.hrc.wmin.ac.uk/theory-californianideology.html| accessdate=2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of techno-utopianism reflected a belief that technological change revolutionizes human affairs, and that digital technology in particular – of which the [[Internet]] was but a modest harbinger – would increase personal freedom by freeing the individual from the rigid embrace of bureaucratic big government. "Self-empowered knowledge workers" would render traditional hierarchies redundant; digital communications would allow them to escape the modern city, an "obsolete remnant of the [[industrial age]]".&lt;ref name="Borsook 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"/&gt;

Similar forms of "digital utopianism" has often entered in the political messages of party and social movements that point to the [[World Wide Web|Web]] or more broadly to [[new media]] as harbingers of political and social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Natale|first=Simone|last2=Ballatore|first2=Andrea|date=2014-01-01|title=The web will kill them all: new media, digital utopia, and political struggle in the Italian 5-Star Movement|url=http://mcs.sagepub.com/content/36/1/105|journal=Media, Culture &amp; Society|language=en|volume=36|issue=1|pages=105–121|doi=10.1177/0163443713511902|issn=0163-4437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its adherents claim it transcended conventional "[[Left–right politics|right/left]]" distinctions in [[politics]] by rendering politics obsolete. However, techno-utopianism disproportionately attracted adherents from the [[Right-libertarianism|libertarian right]] end of the political spectrum. Therefore, techno-utopians often have a [[Economic liberalism|hostility toward government regulation]] and a belief in the superiority of the [[free market]] system. Prominent "[[oracles]]" of techno-utopianism included [[George Gilder]] and [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]], an editor of ''Wired'' who also published several books.&lt;ref name="Borsook 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"/&gt;

During the late 1990s dot-com boom, when the [[Dot-com bubble|speculative bubble]] gave rise to claims that an era of "permanent prosperity" had arrived, techno-utopianism flourished, typically among the small percentage of the population who were employees of Internet [[Startup company|startups]] and/or owned large quantities of high-tech stocks. With the subsequent [[Stock market crash|crash]], many of these dot-com techno-utopians had to rein in some of their beliefs in the face of the clear return of traditional economic reality.&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"/&gt;

In the late 1990s and especially during the first decade of the 21st century, [[technorealism]] and [[techno-progressivism]] are stances that have risen among advocates of [[technological change]] as critical alternatives to techno-utopianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technorealism|url=http://technorealism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = Carrico, Dale|    title =  Technoprogressivism Beyond Technophilia and Technophobia|    year = 2005 |   url = http://amormundi.blogspot.com/2005/06/technoprogressivism-beyond.html| accessdate=2007-01-28|    authorlink = Dale Carrico}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, technological utopianism persists in the 21st century as a result of new technological developments and their impact on society. For example, several [[Technical journalism|technical journalists]] and social commentators, such as [[Mark Pesce]], have interpreted the [[WikiLeaks]] phenomenon and the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]] in early December 2010 as a precursor to, or an incentive for, the creation of a techno-utopian [[Freedom of information laws by country|transparent society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/42148.html |title=The state, the press and a hyperdemocracy |work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |author=Mark Pesce |date=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyber-utopianism]], first coined by [[Evgeny Morozov]], is another manifestation of this, in particular in relation to the [[Internet]] and [[social networking]].

==Principles==
Bernard Gendron, a professor of philosophy at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, defines the four principles of modern technological utopians in the late 20th and early 21st centuries as follows:&lt;ref name="Gendron 1977"&gt;{{cite book|    author = Gendron, Bernard|     title = Technology and the Human Condition| publisher = St.Martin's Press|      year = 1977|        isbn = 0-312-78890-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#We are presently undergoing a ([[post-industrial]]) revolution in technology;
#In the post-industrial age, [[technological change|technological growth]] will be sustained (at least);
#In the post-industrial age, technological growth will lead to the [[post scarcity|end of economic scarcity]];
#The elimination of economic scarcity will lead to the elimination of every major [[social issues|social evil]].

Rushkoff presents us with multiple claims that surround the basic principles of Technological Utopianism:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rushkoff|first1=Douglas|title=Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|date=2002|volume=1|issue=1|pages=21–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''Technology reflects and encourages the best aspects of human nature''', fostering “communication, collaboration, sharing, helpfulness, and community.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rushkoff|first1=Douglas|title=Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|date=2002|volume=1|issue=1|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Technology improves our interpersonal communication, relationships, and communities.''' Early Internet users shared their knowledge of the Internet with others around them.
#'''Technology democratizes society.''' The expansion of access to knowledge and skills led to the connection of people and information. The broadening of freedom of expression created “the online world...in which we are allowed to voice our own opinions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rushkoff|first1=Douglas|title=Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|date=2002|volume=1|issue=1|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction of the inequalities of power and wealth meant that everyone has an equal status on the internet and is allowed to do as much as the next person.
#'''Technology inevitably progresses.''' The interactivity that came from the inventions of the TV [[remote control]], video game [[joystick]], [[computer mouse]] and [[computer keyboard]] allowed for much more progress.
#'''Unforeseen impacts of technology are positive.''' As more people discovered the Internet, they took advantage of being linked to millions of people, and turned the Internet into a social revolution. The government released it to the public, and its “social side effect… [became] its main feature.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
#'''Technology increases efficiency and consumer choice.''' The creation of the TV remote, video game joystick, and computer mouse liberated these technologies and allowed users to manipulate and control them, giving them many more choices.
#'''New technology can solve the problems created by old technology.''' Social networks and blogs were created out of the collapse of [[dot.com bubble]] businesses’ attempts to run pyramid schemes on users.

==Criticisms==

Critics claim that techno-utopianism's identification of [[social progress]] with [[scientific progress]] is a form of [[positivism]] and [[scientism]]. Critics of modern libertarian techno-utopianism point out that it tends to focus on "government interference" while dismissing the positive effects of the [[regulation]] of [[business]]. They also point out that it has little to say about the [[Technology#Environmental|environmental impact of technology]]&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; and that its ideas have little relevance for much of the rest of the world that are still relatively quite poor (see [[global digital divide]]).&lt;ref name="Borsook 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"/&gt;

In his 2010 study ''System Failure: Oil, Futurity, and the Anticipation of Disaster'', [[Canada Research Chair]]holder in cultural studies Imre Szeman argues that technological utopianism is one of the social narratives that prevent people from acting on the knowledge they have concerning the [[environmental issues with petroleum|effects of oil on the environment]].&lt;ref name="sciencedaily.com"/&gt;

In a controversial article "Techno-Utopians are Mugged by Reality", [[Wall Street Journal]] explores the concept of the violation of free speech by shutting down social media to stop violence. As a result of British cities being looted consecutively, Prime British Minister David Cameron argued that the government should have the ability to shut down social media during crime sprees so that the situation could be contained. A poll was conducted to see if Twitter users would prefer to let the service be closed temporarily or keep it open so they can chat about the famous television show X-Factor. The end report showed that every Tweet opted for X-Factor. The negative social effects of technological utopia is that society is so addicted to technology that we simply can't be parted even for the greater good. While many Techno-Utopians would like to believe that digital technology is for the greater good, it can also be used negatively to bring harm to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903918104576506393735675856.html#articleTabs%3Darticle|title= Techno-Utopians Are Mugged by Reality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics of a techno-utopia include the worry of the human element. Critics suggest that a techno-utopia may lessen human contact, leading to a distant society. Another concern is the amount of reliance society may place on their technologies in these techno-utopia settings.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], ”Technological Dependency and Loss of Freedom”, pp. 245, New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These criticisms are sometimes referred to as a technological anti-utopian view or a techno-dystopia.

Even today, the negative social effects of a technological utopia can be seen. Mediated communication such as phone calls, instant messaging and text messaging are steps towards a utopian world in which one can easily contact another regardless of time or location. However, mediated communication removes many aspects that are helpful in transferring messages. As it stands today, most text, email, and instant messages offer fewer nonverbal cues about the speaker’s feelings than do face-to-face encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adler &amp; Proctor II|first=Ronald B. &amp; Russell F.|title=Looking Out Looking In|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth Cenage Learning|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-0-495-79621-3|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it so that mediated communication can easily be misconstrued and the intended message is not properly conveyed. With the absence of tone, body language, and environmental context, the chance of a misunderstanding is much higher, rendering the communication ineffective. In fact, mediated technology can be seen from a dystopian view because it can be detrimental to effective interpersonal communication.  These criticisms would only apply to messages that are prone to misinterpretation as not every text based communication requires contextual cues.  The limitations of lacking tone and body language in text based communication are likely to be mitigated by [[videotelephony|video]] and [[augmented reality]] versions of digital communication technologies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tcworld.info/e-magazine/technical-communication/article/augmented-reality-in-technical-communication/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teen dating violence''' is the [[physical abuse|physical]], [[sexual abuse|sexual]], or [[psychological abuse|psychological]] / [[emotional abuse|emotional]] [[abuse]] (or [[violence]]) within a dating relationship among adolescents.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web | last = CDC | author-link = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | title = Teen dating violence | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | date = June 29, 2015 | accessdate = November 15, 2015 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/intimatepartnerviolence/teen_dating_violence.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Intimate partner violence]] (IPV) has been a well examined and documented phenomenon in adults; however, there has not been nearly as much study on violence in adolescent dating relationships, and it is therefore not as well understood. The research has mainly focused on Caucasian youth, and there are yet no studies which focus specifically on IPV in adolescent same-sex romantic relationships.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Chu | first1 = Ann T. | last2 = Sundermann | first2 = Jane M. | last3 = DePrince | first3 = Anne P. | contribution = Intimate partner violence in adolescent romantic relationships | editor-last1 = Donohue | editor-first1 = William T. | editor-last2 = Benuto | editor-first2 = Lorraine T. | editor-last3 = Woodward Tolle | editor-first3 = Lauren | title = Handbook of adolescent health psychology | page = 193 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | location = New York, New York | year = 2013 | isbn = 9781461466338 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=KX29BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA193 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intimate partner violence (IPV) in adolescents is an important realm of study as, in addition to the usual negative effects of abuse, this violence occurs at a critical period in the social and mental development of a person.  This is also an important topic from a [[gender studies]] perspective as almost 32% of male adolescents engage in some form of violence, whether sexual, physical or emotional, towards their partners while adolescent violence from females is nearly half of that rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bachman | first1 = Ronet | last2 = Peralta | first2 = Robert | title = The relationship between drinking and violence in an adolescent population: does gender matter? | journal = [[Deviant Behavior (journal)|Deviant Behavior]] | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–19 | doi = 10.1080/016396202317192008 | date = January 2002 | ref = harv }} [http://www3.uakron.edu/publications/relationshiprp.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to the United States public health authority, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), "[a]dolescents and adults are often unaware that teens experience dating violence."&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;

==Gender differences==
{{see also|Domestic violence#Gender differences}}
The literature on IPV among adolescents indicates that the rates are similar for the number of girls and boys in heterosexual relationships who report experiencing IPV, or that girls in heterosexual relationships are more likely than their male counterparts to report perpetrating IPV.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Knox | first1 = Lyndee | last2 = Lomonaco | first2 = Carmela | last3 = Alpert | first3 = Elaine | contribution = Adolescent relationship violence | editor-last1 = Mitchell | editor-first1 = Connie | editor-last2 = Anglin | editor-first2 = Deirdre | title = Intimate partner violence: a health-based perspective | pages = 514, 516 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = Oxford New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780199720729 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q04QO7UmyowC&amp;pg=PA514 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = Jessica R. | last2 = Ghandour | first2 = Reem M. | last3 = Kub | first3 = Joan E. | title = Female perpetration of violence in heterosexual intimate relationships: adolescence through adulthood | journal = [[Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse]] | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 227–249 | doi = 10.1177/1524838008324418 | pmc = 2663360 | date = October 2008 | ref = harv | pmid=18936281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ely et al. stated that, unlike domestic violence in general, equal rates of IPV perpetration is a unique characteristic with regard adolescent dating violence, and that this is "perhaps because the period of adolescence, a special developmental state, is accompanied by sexual characteristics that are distinctly different from the characteristics of adult."&lt;ref name="Rapp-Paglicci"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Ely | first1 = Gretchen | last2 = Dulmus | first2 = Catherine N. | last3 = Wodarski | first3 = John S. | contribution = Adolescent dating violence | editor-last1 = Rapp-Paglicci | editor-first1 = Lisa A. | editor-last2 = Roberts | editor-first2 = Albert R. | editor-last3 = Wodarski | editor-first3 = John S. | title = Handbook of violence | page = 36 | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780471214441 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=YtOvUULaNZEC&amp;pg=PA36 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; Wekerle and Wolfe theorized that "a mutually coercive and violent dynamic may form during adolescence, a time when males and females are more equal on a physical level" and that this "physical equality allows girls to assert more power through physical violence than is possible for an adult female attacked by a fully physically mature man."&lt;ref name="Rapp-Paglicci"/&gt;

Regarding studies that indicate that girls are as likely or more likely than boys to commit IPV, the authors emphasize that substantial differences exist between the genders, including that girls are significantly more likely than boys to report having experienced severe IPV, such as being threatened with a weapon, punched, strangled, beaten, burned, or raped, and are also substantially more likely than boys to need  psychological help or experience physical injuries that require medical help for the abuse, and to report sexual violence as a part of dating violence. They are also more likely to take IPV more seriously. By contrast, boys are more likely to report experiencing less severe acts, such as being pinched, slapped, scratched or kicked. Girls are more likely to report committing less serious forms of IPV, including as a means of self-defense, whereas boys are more likely to report committing more severe acts of IPV, including threats, physical violence and controlling a partner.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; That girls are more likely to engage in IPV as a result of self-defense is supported by findings that previous victimization is a stronger predictor of perpetration in females than in males.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;{{citation | last1 = Edwards | first1 = Katie M. | last2 = Dardis | first2 = Christina M. | last3 = Gidycz | first3 = Christine A. | contribution = The role of victimization experiences in adolescent girls and young women's aggression in dating relationships | editor-last = Paludi | editor-first = Michele A. | title = The psychology of teen violence and victimization, volume 2, Part I.

==Controversies and arguments==
There is a common misconception that aggression is stable over time. That is, young people who are labeled as or considered to be violent and aggressive at any point in time are then assumed to be dangerous for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Loeber | first1 = Rolf | last2 = Stouthamer-Loeber | first2 = Magda | title = Development of juvenile aggression and violence: some common misconceptions and controversies | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 242–259 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.53.2.242 | pmid = 9491750 | date = February 1998 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a contentious issue because there is a desire to protect both parties involved (or that have the potential to become involved) in teen dating violence. While classifying the perpetrator as a threat may be detrimental to his or her life and future relationships, not classifying the perpetrator this way may put future partners at risk.

There is considerable debate over whether we as a society have an accurate picture of the prevalence and severity of teen dating violence by gender. It is important to note that although male and female adolescents do not differ in "overall frequency of violence in dating relationships," females are subject to "significantly higher levels of severe violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Molidor | first1 = Christian | last2 = Tolman | first2 = Richard M. | title = Gender and contextual factors in adolescent dating violence | journal = [[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 180–194 | doi = 10.1177/1077801298004002004 | pmid = 12295440 | date = April 1998 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact begs the question of whether abuse should be evaluated based on “severity” and how that can and should be measured, or if all abuse should be considered equally harmful.

[[Age of consent]] is an issue that cannot be ignored in the discussion of teenage dating violence. Teenage sex is regulated in such a way that "age of consent laws render teenagers below a certain age incapable of consent to sexual activity with adults, and sometimes with peers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sutherland | first = Kate | title = From jailbird to jailbait: age of consent laws and the construction of teenage sexualities | journal = [[William &amp; Mary Law School#Law journals|William &amp; Mary Journal of Women and the Law]] | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 313–349 | ssrn = 1586883 | date = Spring 2003 | url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/wmjwl9&amp;div=20 | ref = harv }} [http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1167&amp;context=wmjowl Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the adult may be just a few months older than the minor. There are a number of states in which "age of consent statutes are used to prosecute consensual sex between two persons both under the age of consent." This type of prosecution has been deemed unconstitutional in some states by citing violation of privacy rights, but remains in effect in other states. Sexual behavior and aggression can be so deeply intertwined that the legality of underage consensual sex is sure to have an effect on teen dating violence.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Nature vs. nurture==
{{OR section|date=September 2015}}
Significant research has been done on the causes behind violent behavior in adolescent dating relationships with the intention of guiding the creation of dating violence prevention programs, and in turn has provided findings on the roles of nature and nurture in the development of such behavior with a strong favor towards nurture factors. A study published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health examined the potential association between a spectrum of childhood adverse experiences and physical violence in relationships before age 21 for both members. The subjects were asked questions about violence in their adolescent relationships, as either victim or perpetrator, and their childhood surrounding twelve different adversities: parental death, parental divorce, long-term separation from parent, parental mental illness, parental substance abuse disorder, parental criminality, inter-parental violence, serious physical illness in childhood, physical abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, and family economic adversity. The results demonstrated a strong positive correlation between ten out of the twelve childhood adversities and physically violent behavior in a teen relationship, with 13.8% responding with experiences of sexual violence, and 11.6% experiencing inter-parental violence. This points to a strong influence of experience, or nature, on violent tendencies in adolescent relationships. Multiple other studies corroborate these findings, citing childhood bullying, assault, and maltreatment as significant indicators for future violence in adolescent dating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = Elizabeth | last2 = Breslau | first2 = Joshua | last3 = Chung | first3 = W.J. Joanie | last4 = Green | first4 = Jennifer Greif | last5 = McLaughlin | first5 = Katie A. | last6 = Kessler | first6 = Ronald C. | title = Adverse childhood experiences and risk of physical violence in adolescent dating relationships | journal = [[Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health]] | volume = 65 | issue = 11 | pages = 1006–1013 | doi = 10.1136/jech.2009.105429 | pmid = 21321063 | date = November 2011 | ref = harv | pmc=3686487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there has been little explicit study of the relationship between nature and teen dating violence, there has been proven correlation between testosterone levels and violent tendencies that could come to fruition in adolescent dating relationships. Higher testosterone levels “manifests itself in various intensities and forms from; thoughts, anger, verbal aggressiveness, competition, dominance behavior, to physical violence.”  A study published in the International Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism reported, “Testosterone plays a significant role in the arousal of these behavioral manifestations in the brain centers involved in aggression and on the development of the muscular system that enables their realization. There is evidence that testosterone levels are higher in individuals with aggressive behavior, such as prisoners who have committed violent crimes.” However, the study also noted that many cases of high testosterone levels are disarmed through socialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Batrinos | first = Menelaos L. | title = Testosterone and aggressive behavior in man | journal = International Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 563–568 | doi = 10.5812/ijem.3661 | pmc = 3693622 | date = June 2012 | ref = harv | pmid=23843821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, because children are exposed to relationships early in their life through their parents and being so malleable at a young age, most evidence points to an adverse experience or experiences in childhood as fodder for such behavior in adolescence.

==Prevalence and approaches==
The literature on IPV among adolescents primarily focuses on Caucasian youth, and there are yet no studies which focus specifically on IPV in adolescent same-sex romantic relationships.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"/&gt;

====Statistics====
While dating, domestic and sexual violence affect women regardless of their age, teens and young women are especially vulnerable. Young people ages 12 to 19 experience the highest rates of rape and sexual assault,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Truman | first1 = Jennifer L. | last2 = Rand | first2 = Michael R. | title = Criminal victimization, 2009 | url = http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv09.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] | location = Washington, D.C. | date = October 2010 }} {{NCJ|231327}}&lt;/ref&gt; and people age 18 and 19 experience the highest rates of stalking. Approximately one in three adolescent girls in the United States is a victim of physical, emotional, or verbal abuse from a dating partner—a figure that far exceeds victimization rates for other types of violence affecting youth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Davis | first = Antoinette | title = Interpersonal and physical dating violence among teens | journal = The National Council on Crime and Delinquency Focus | date = September 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120425153501/http://www.nccd-crc.org/nccd/pubs/2008_focus_teen_dating_violence.pdf | archive-date = 25 April 2012 | url = http://www.nccd-crc.org/nccd/pubs/2008_focus_teen_dating_violence.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Andrew Green|Mark Green]], former Wisconsin Representative said "if the numbers we see in domestic violence (dating violence) were applied to terrorism or gang violence, the entire country would be up in arms, and it would be the lead story on the news every night".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Savacool | first = Julia | title = Our most important mission ever: stop violence against women now | url = http://www.marieclaire.com/world-reports/news/domestic-violence-stop | work = [[Marie Claire]] | publisher = [[Hearst Corporation]] | date = 10 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Women's Health'', "81% of parents surveyed either believed dating violence is not an issue or admit they don't know if it's an issue",&lt;ref name=UMHS&gt;{{cite journal | last = Staff writer | title = Who's affected by dating violence? | journal = Women's Health | page = 3 | date = June–July 2004 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080905041051/http://www.med.umich.edu/whp/newsletters/summer04/p03-dating.html | archive-date = 5 September 2008 | url = http://www.med.umich.edu/whp/newsletters/summer04/p03-dating.html | ref = harv }} Sources: [[Futures Without Violence|Family Violence Prevention Fund]] and [[Advocates for Youth]]&lt;/ref&gt; this is concerning because of the growth of dating abuse in teenagers relationships.&lt;ref name=UMHS /&gt; Dating violence has advanced{{Clarify|date=September 2015}} through the years by the means of communication technology.  A survey conducted by Teenage Research Unlimited stated that "[10] percent of teens have been threatened physically via e-mail, IM, text messaging, chat rooms, etc."

A 2008 [[meta-analysis]], which examined 62 [[empirical research]] studies between 1996 and 2006, relating to domestic violence in heterosexual intimate relationships from adolescence through to adulthood in the United States, reported on research findings that consistently show that adolescent females commit significantly more acts of domestic violence in intimate relationships than adolescent males. It stated, however, that the "data also suggest that females who commit acts of domestic violence may experience more violent or frequent IPV victimization than males" and that "[t]he highest rates [for female-perpetrated IPV] were found for emotional violence, followed by physical and sexual violence. Prevalence rates varied widely within each population, most likely due to methodological and sampling differences across studies." The authors added, "Few longitudinal studies existed, limiting the extent to which we could identify developmental patterns associated with female perpetrated intimate partner violence." They found a few studies which reported prevalence rates of IPV perpetration among females at two or more time points, which they stated made "it difficult to obtain a clear picture of the developmental patterns associated with this type of violence." There was also only one study that reported on prevalence rates over time for female perpetrated IPV among adolescents. "This study found a significant increase in prevalence over a six month period; however, they measured lifetime perpetration of IPV, therefore, it is unclear if there was an actual increase or simply an accumulation of violence," stated the authors. "Together, these studies provide very limited evidence that female perpetration of IPV may follow a similar developmental trajectory as other forms of violence. [...] Unfortunately, many of the studies included in this review used modified or alternative instruments making it difficult to accurately compare prevalence estimates."&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

In a 2009 survey, the CDC found that 9.8% of high school students in the U.S. reported having been intentionally physically hurt by their boyfriend or girlfriend in the preceding 12&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; A 2011 CDC nationwide survey of the U.S. population reported that 23% of females and 14% of males who ever experienced rape, other physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner first experienced some form of partner violence between 11 and 17 years of age.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; The ages between 16 and 24 are when youth are the most susceptible to dating violence. Also, according to the CDC, one in ten teens will be physically abused between seventh and twelfth grade. Because of this abuse, victims are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol, employ precarious sexual conduct, develop eating disorders, and attempt suicide.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; The above numbers are notable in their magnitude and in their discrepancy, indicating that at some point between birth and high school a huge number of males are learning that it is useful and acceptable to abuse their dating partners in some way. The reciprocal of males learning violent behaviors is that women are not learning this fact and are instead learning through our culture and through violence directed at them that they are to be submissive. Males learning violent behaviors coupled with females thinking it normative creates a cycle of women being abused, learning to accept it and imparting this idea to their children and repeating the process. According to a study conducted by Susan M. Sanders she found that many adolescents do not always view aggressive behavior as violent or abusive and roughly 77.6% young girls agreed that after a physical altercation such as being kicked by their partner that they would cease to date them. The study conducted demonstrated that many adolescents, primarily females were more susceptible to leave only after a physical altercation took place. With these studies it was found that once a physical altercation took place the victim  would then view it as abusive and eventually desire to leave the relationship.&lt;ref&gt; Susan, M. S.(2003) Teen Dating Violence: The Invisible Peril. New York. Peter Lang Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescent dating violence is a subject which must be understood in order for true equality between the sexes to be achieved and to help stop partner violence in adults before it occurs.

====Legislation====
In the United States, the National Conference of State Legislators (NCSL) states that "[p]olicymakers can play a role in preventing teen dating violence".&lt;ref name=NCSL&gt;{{cite web | title = Teen dating violence | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120609073629/http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/health/teen-dating-violence.aspx | archive-date = 9 June 2012 | url = http://www.ncsl.org/?tabid=17582 | website = ncsl.org | publisher = [[National Conference of State Legislatures]] | date = May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and lists those states that currently have laws requiring school boards to develop and adopt programs to address this issue. Further, according to NCSL "[i]n 2011 at least eight states have introduced legislation to address teen dating violence".&lt;ref name=NCSL/&gt; On January 31, 2011, President Obama proclaimed February 2011 to be "National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = President of the United States | author-link = President of the United States | title = Presidential proclamation--National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, 2011 | url = http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/01/31/presidential-proclamation-national-teen-dating-violence-awareness-and-pr | website = whitehouse.gov | publisher = [[White House]] | date = 31 January 2011 | access-date = 13 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the U.S. first recognized "National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Week", sponsored by Senator [[Mike Crapo]], to "increase public awareness and education of the prevalence of teen dating violence among our nation's teens".&lt;ref name=Crapo&gt;{{cite web | last = Crapo | first = Mike (Sen.) | author-link = Mike Crapo | title = Teen dating violence awareness week | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130219164115/http://www.crapo.senate.gov/issues/teen_dating_violence.cfm | archive-date = 19 February 2013 | url = http://www.crapo.senate.gov/issues/teen_dating_violence.cfm | website = crapo.senate.gov | date = 19 February 2013 | access-date = 13 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first week in February was so recognized through 2009. Beginning in 2010, Senator Crapo joined the Department of Justice in recognizing the month of February as Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month.&lt;ref name=Crapo/&gt;

====National helpline and organizations====
The National Dating Abuse Helpline, created by [[National Domestic Violence Hotline]], is a 24-hour nationwide Web-based and telephone resource created to help teens and young people who are experiencing dating abuse. They offer information on building healthy relationships and how to recognize warning signs. It is the only helpline in the country serving all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hingorani | first = Jitin | title = New national teen dating abuse helpline to provide urgent support for teens | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090214073216/http://www.jwi.org/site/c.okLWJ3MPKtH/b.2541101/k.7124/New_National_Teen_Dating_Abuse_Helpline_to_Provide_Urgent_Support_for_Teens.htm | archive-date = 14 February 2009 | url = http://www.jwi.org/site/c.okLWJ3MPKtH/b.2541101/k.7124/New_National_Teen_Dating_Abuse_Helpline_to_Provide_Urgent_Support_for_Teens.htm | website = jwi.org | publisher = Resources, Training &amp; Education: Domestic Violence Newsletters, Jewish Women International | date = March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cool Stuff Collective''''' is a British children's television programme, which was produced for three series that aired on the [[ITV Network]] and [[CITV]] respectively from 13 September 2010 to 24 December 2011. The show featured reviews of the latest and forthcoming video games, gadgets, films and music. CITV also broadcast a similar format programme called "Play The Game" in 2004. [[Sy Thomas]] presented the programme for the majority of its run, with Vicky Letch and The Blowfish later taking over for the final series.

==Controversy==
In 2011, the programme was found to have breached [[Ofcom]]'s rules on [[product placement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jun/07/itv-kids-show-plugging-games | title=ITV kids' show rapped for plugging games |work=The Guardian | date=7 June 2011 | accessdate=16 September 2011 | author=Sweney, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ofcom stated that many of the items featured on the show ended with "overt encouragements" to consider purchase of the product.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

'''Volunteer Centers''' or '''Volunteer Centres''' exist primarily to foster and develop [[volunteerism]] in the community as a whole. In general they do 4 things: Promote volunteerism, capacity building for effective local volunteering, provide leadership on issues relating to volunteerism, provide leadership on issues relating to volunteerism and connect people with opportunities to serve.&lt;ref&gt;This part of the definition was formally adapted by the Board of Directors of Volunteer Canada on September 30, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

"Volunteer Centres" in the UK are sometimes known as "volunteer bureaux" or "volunteer development agencies". Working to a national model they provide support at a local level for individual volunteers and volunteer involving organisations. They have six core functions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volunteering.org.uk/WhatWeDo/Local+and+Regional/whatdovolunteerdevelopmentagenciesdo.htm Core Functions of a Volunteer Centre in England]&lt;/ref&gt; which combined seek to promote and develop volunteering in local communities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/Article/906458/Volunteer-centres-struggle-tidal-wave-demand/ Third Sector Magazine article on increasing demand for Volunteer Centre Services]&lt;/ref&gt; and link potential volunteers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article401328.ece The Times article on volunteering through Volunteer Centres using a national volunteering database]&lt;/ref&gt; with volunteer involving organisations.

Publishing whisper networks to the public has been widely criticized for spreading unsubstantiated rumors which can damage reputations,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/post-weinstein-new-apps-aim-to-out-predators-before-they-become-serial-abusers-2018-01-24|title=These apps help victims of sexual harassment to file anonymous reports|last=Paul|first=Kari|work=MarketWatch|access-date=2018-01-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; though there continues to be debate on the best alternatives to anonymous sharing for women who have been punished or ignored by official channels yet would still like to warn other women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/01/katha-pollitt-on-second-wave-feminism-harassment-and-progress.html|title=How Second-Wave Feminism Inexplicably Became a Villain in the #MeToo Debate|last=Chotiner|first=Isaac|work=Slate Magazine|access-date=2018-01-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that certain vulnerable groups rarely get access to these private lists, for example women who are young and women of color.
