      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27237">In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical computer science]], '''analysis of Boolean functions'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Donnell|first=Ryan|date=2014|title=Analysis of Boolean functions|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-03832-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the study of real-valued functions on &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; from a spectral perspective (such functions are sometimes known as [[pseudo-Boolean function]]s). The functions studied are often, but not always, Boolean-valued, making them [[Boolean function]]s. The area has found many applications in [[combinatorics]], [[social choice theory]], [[random graph]]s, and theoretical computer science, especially in [[hardness of approximation]], [[property testing]] and [[probably approximately correct learning|PAC learning]].

==Basic concepts==

We will mostly consider functions defined on the domain &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Sometimes it is more convenient to work with the domain &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; instead. If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is defined on &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;, then the corresponding function defined on &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;f_{01}(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = f((-1)^{x_1},\ldots,(-1)^{x_n}).&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for us a Boolean function is a &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt;-valued function, though often it is more convenient to consider &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;-valued functions instead.

===Fourier expansion===

Every real-valued function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; has a unique expansion as a multilinear polynomial:

:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \hat{f}(S) \chi_S(x), \quad \chi_S(x) = \prod_{i \in S} x_i. &lt;/math&gt;

This is the [[Hadamard transform]] of the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, which is the [[Fourier transform]] in the [[group (mathematics)|group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_2^n&lt;/math&gt;. The coefficients &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(S)&lt;/math&gt; are known as ''Fourier coefficients'', and the entire sum is known as the ''Fourier expansion'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. The functions &lt;math&gt;\chi_S&lt;/math&gt; are known as ''Fourier characters'', and they form an orthonormal basis for the space of all functions over &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;, with respect to the inner product &lt;math&gt;\langle f,g \rangle = 2^{-n} \sum_{x \in \{-1,1\}^n} f(x) g(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

The Fourier coefficients can be calculated using an inner product:

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{f}(S) = \langle f, \chi_S \rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

In particular, this shows that &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(\emptyset) = \mathbb{E}[f].&lt;/math&gt; Parseval's identity states that

:&lt;math&gt; \|f\|^2 = \mathbb{E}[f^2] = \sum_S \hat{f}(S)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

If we skip &lt;math&gt;S = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, then we get the variance of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbb{V}[f] = \sum_{S \neq \emptyset} \hat{f}(S)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Fourier degree and Fourier levels ===

The ''degree'' of a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(S) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; for some set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of size &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, the degree of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is its degree as a multilinear polynomial.

It is convenient to decompose the Fourier expansion into ''levels'': the Fourier coefficient &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(S)&lt;/math&gt; is on level &lt;math&gt;|S|&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;'' part of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; f^{=d} = \sum_{|S| = d} \hat{f}(S) \chi_S. &lt;/math&gt;

It is obtained from &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; by zeroing out all Fourier coefficients not on level &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

We similarly define &lt;math&gt;f^{&gt;d},f^{&lt;d},f^{\geq d},f^{\leq d}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Influence===

The &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'th influence of a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; can be defined in two equivalent ways:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = \mathbb{E}\left[ \left(\frac{f - f^{\oplus i}}{2} \right)^2 \right] = \sum_{S \ni i} \hat{f}(S)^2, \\[5pt]
&amp; f^{\oplus i}(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = f(x_1,\ldots,x_{i-1},-x_i,x_{i+1},\ldots,x_n).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Boolean then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}_i[f]&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that flipping the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'th coordinate flips the value of the function:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = \Pr[f(x) \neq f^{\oplus i}(x)]. &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = 0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; doesn't depend on the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'th coordinate.

The ''total influence'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of all of its influences:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}[f] = \sum_{i=1}^n \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = \sum_S |S| \hat{f}(S)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

The total influence of a Boolean function is also the ''average sensitivity'' of the function. The ''sensitivity'' of a Boolean function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at a given point is the number of coordinates &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; such that if we flip the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'th coordinate, the value of the function changes. The average value of this quantity is exactly the total influence.

The total influence can also be defined using the [[Discrete Laplace operator#Graph Laplacians|discrete Laplacian]] of the [[Hamming graph]], suitably normalized:  &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}[f] = \langle f,Lf \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

===Noise stability===

Given &lt;math&gt;-1 \leq \rho \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, we say that two random vectors &lt;math&gt;x,y \in \{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; are ''&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;-correlated'' if the marginal distributions of &lt;math&gt;x,y&lt;/math&gt; are uniform, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}[x_iy_i] = \rho&lt;/math&gt;. Concretely, we can generate a pair of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;-correlated random variables by first choosing &lt;math&gt;x,z \in \{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; uniformly at random, and then choosing &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; according to one of the following two equivalent rules, applied independently to each coordinate:

:&lt;math&gt; y_i = \begin{cases} x_i &amp; \text{w.p. } \rho, \\ z_i &amp; \text{w.p. } 1-\rho. \end{cases} \quad \text{or} \quad y_i = \begin{cases} x_i &amp; \text{w.p. } \frac{1+\rho}{2}, \\ -x_i &amp; \text{w.p. } \frac{1-\rho}{2}. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

We denote this distribution by &lt;math&gt; y \sim N_\rho(x) &lt;/math&gt;.

The ''noise stability'' of a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; can be defined in two equivalent ways:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Stab}_\rho[f] = \operatorname{\mathbb{E}}_{x; y \sim N_\rho(x)}[f(x) f(y)] = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \rho^{|S|} \hat{f}(S)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \delta \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, the ''noise sensitivity'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{NS}_\delta[f] = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{Stab}_{1-2\delta}[f]. &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Boolean, then this is the probability that the value of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; changes if we flip each coordinate with probability &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, independently.

===Noise operator===

The ''noise operator'' &lt;math&gt;T_\rho&lt;/math&gt; is an operator taking a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and returning another function &lt;math&gt;T_\rho f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt; (T_\rho f)(x) = \mathbb{E}_{y \sim N_\rho(x)}[f(y)] = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \rho^{|S|} \hat{f}(S) \chi_S. &lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;\rho &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the noise operator can also be defined using a [[continuous-time Markov chain]] in which each bit is flipped independently with rate 1. The operator &lt;math&gt;T_\rho&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to running this Markov chain for &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\log\frac{1}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt; steps starting at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and taking the average value of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at the final state. This Markov chain is generated by the Laplacian of the Hamming graph, and this relates total influence to the noise operator.

Noise stability can be defined in terms of the noise operator: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Stab}_\rho[f] = \langle f, T_\rho f \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.

===Hypercontractivity===

For &lt;math&gt;1 \leq q &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Lp space#Lp spaces|&lt;math&gt;L_q&lt;/math&gt;-norm]] of a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \|f\|_q = \sqrt[q]{\mathbb{E}[|f|^q]}. &lt;/math&gt;

We also define &lt;math&gt;\|f\|_\infty = \max_{x \in \{-1,1\}^n} |f(x)|.&lt;/math&gt;

The hypercontractivity theorem states that for any &lt;math&gt;q &gt; 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q' = 1/(1-1/q)&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \|T_\rho f\|_q \leq \|f\|_2 \quad \text{and} \quad \|T_\rho f\|_2 \leq \|f\|_{q'}. &lt;/math&gt;

Hypercontractivity is closely related to the [[logarithmic Sobolev inequalities]] of [[functional analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diaconis|first1=Persi|last2=Saloff-Coste|first2=Laurent|date=1996|title=Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities for finite Markov chains|journal=Ann. Appl. Probab.|volume=6|number=3|pages=695–750|doi=10.1214/aoap/1034968224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar result for &lt;math&gt;q &lt; 2&lt;/math&gt; is known as ''reverse hypercontractivity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mossel|first1=Elchanan|last2=Oleszkiewicz|first2=Krzysztof|last3=Sen|first3=Arnab|date=2013|title=On reverse hypercontractivity|journal=GAFA|volume=23|number=3|pages=1062–1097|doi=10.1007/s00039-013-0229-4|arxiv=1108.1210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''p''-Biased analysis===

In many situations the input to the function is not uniformly distributed over &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;, but instead has a bias toward &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. In these situations it is customary to consider functions over the domain &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; p &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, the ''p''-biased measure &lt;math&gt;\mu_p&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \mu_p(x) = p^{\sum_i x_i} (1-p)^{\sum_i (1-x_i)}. &lt;/math&gt;

This measure can be generated by choosing each coordinate independently to be 1 with probability &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and 0 with probability &lt;math&gt;1-p&lt;/math&gt;.

The classical Fourier characters are no longer orthogonal with respect to this measure. Instead, we use the following characters:

:&lt;math&gt; \omega_S(x) = \left(\sqrt{\frac{p}{1-p}}\right)^{|\{i \in S : x_i = 0\}|} \left(-\sqrt{\frac{1-p}{p}}\right)^{|\{i \in S : x_i = 1\}|}. &lt;/math&gt;

The ''p''-biased Fourier expansion of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the expansion of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; as a linear combination of ''p''-biased characters:

:&lt;math&gt; f = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \hat{f}(S) \omega_S. &lt;/math&gt;

We can extend the definitions of influence and the noise operator to the ''p''-biased setting by using their spectral definitions.

====Influence====

The &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'s influence is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = \sum_{S \ni i} \hat{f}(S)^2 = p(1-p) \mathbb{E}[(f-f^{\oplus i})^2]. &lt;/math&gt;

The total influence is the sum of the individual influences:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}[f] = \sum_{i=1}^n \operatorname{Inf}_i[f].&lt;/math&gt;

====Noise operator====

A pair of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;-correlated random variables can be obtained by choosing &lt;math&gt;x,z \sim \mu_p&lt;/math&gt; independently and &lt;math&gt;y \sim N_\rho(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;N_\rho&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt; y_i = \begin{cases} x_i &amp; \text{w.p. } \rho, \\ z_i &amp; \text{w.p. } 1-\rho. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

The noise operator is then given by

:&lt;math&gt; (T_\rho f)(x) = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \rho^{|S|} \hat{f}(S) \omega_S(x) = \operatorname{\mathbb{E}}_{y \sim N_\rho(x)} [f(y)]. &lt;/math&gt;

Using this we can define the noise stability and the noise sensitivity, as before.

====Russo–Margulis formula====

The Russo–Margulis formula states that for monotone Boolean functions &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dp} \operatorname{\mathbb{E}}_{x \sim \mu_p} [f(x)] = \frac{\operatorname{Inf}[f]}{p(1-p)} = \sum_{i=1}^n \Pr[f \neq f^{\oplus i}]. &lt;/math&gt;

Both the influence and the probabilities are taken with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mu_p&lt;/math&gt;, and on the right-hand side we have the average sensitivity of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. If we think of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; as a property, then the formula states that as &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; varies, the derivative of the probability that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; occurs at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; equals the average sensitivity at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

The Russo–Margulis formula is key for proving sharp threshold theorems such as [[#Friedgut's sharp threshold theorem|Friedgut's]].

===Gaussian space===

One of the deepest results in the area, the [[#Invariance principle|invariance principle]], connects the distribution of functions on the Boolean cube &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; to their distribution on ''Gaussian space'', which is the space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; endowed with the standard &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Gaussian measure]].

Many of the basic concepts of Fourier analysis on the Boolean cube have counterparts in Gaussian space:

* The counterpart of the Fourier expansion in Gaussian space is the Hermite expansion, which is an expansion to an infinite sum (converging in &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt;) of multivariate [[Hermite polynomials]].
* The counterpart of total influence or average sensitivity for the indicator function of a set is Gaussian surface area, which is the Minkowski content of the boundary of the set.
* The counterpart of the noise operator is the [[Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process|Ornstein–Uhlenbeck operator]] (related to the [[Mehler kernel|Mehler transform]]), given by &lt;math&gt;(U_\rho f)(x) = \operatorname{\mathbb{E}}_{z \sim N(0,1)}[f(\rho x + \sqrt{1-\rho^2}z)]&lt;/math&gt;, or alternatively by &lt;math&gt;(U_\rho f)(x) = \operatorname{\mathbb{E}}[f(y)]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x,y&lt;/math&gt; is a pair of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;-correlated standard Gaussians.
* Hypercontractivity holds (with appropriate parameters) in Gaussian space as well.

Gaussian space is more symmetric than the Boolean cube (for example, it is rotation invariant), and supports continuous arguments which may be harder to get through in the discrete setting of the Boolean cube. The invariance principle links the two settings, and allows deducing results on the Boolean cube from results on Gaussian space.

==Basic results==

===Friedgut–Kalai–Naor theorem===

If &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; has degree at most 1, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is either constant, equal to a coordinate, or equal to the negation of a coordinate. In particular, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a ''dictatorship'': a function depending on at most one coordinate.

The Friedgut–Kalai–Naor theorem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Friedgut |first1=Ehud |last2=Kalai |first2=Gil |last3=Naor |first3=Assaf |date=2002 |title=Boolean functions whose Fourier transform is concentrated on the first two levels |journal=Adv. Appl. Math. |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=427–437 |doi=10.1016/S0196-8858(02)00024-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the ''FKN theorem'', states that if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; ''almost'' has degree 1 then it is ''close'' to a dictatorship. Quantitatively, if &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|f^{&gt;1}\|^2 &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;O(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;-close to a dictatorship, that is, &lt;math&gt;\|f - g\|^2 = O(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; for some Boolean dictatorship &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently, &lt;math&gt;\Pr[f \neq g] = O(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; for some Boolean dictatorship &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, a Boolean function of degree at most &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; depends on at most &lt;math&gt;d2^{d-1}&lt;/math&gt; coordinates, making it a ''junta'' (a function depending on a constant number of coordinates). The Kindler–Safra theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Kindler |first=Guy |date=2002 |title=Property testing, PCP, and juntas |chapter=16 |publisher=Tel Aviv University}}&lt;/ref&gt; generalizes the Friedgut–Kalai–Naor theorem to this setting. It states that if &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\|f^{&gt;d}\|^2 &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;O(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;-close to a Boolean function of degree at most &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

===Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem===

The Poincaré inequality for the Boolean cube (which follows from formulas appearing above) states that for a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{V}[f] \leq \operatorname{Inf}[f] \leq \deg f \cdot \mathbb{V}[f]. &lt;/math&gt;

This implies that &lt;math&gt;\max_i \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] \geq \frac{\mathbb{V}[f]}{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

The Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=The influence of variables on Boolean functions. |last1=Kahn |first1=Jeff |last2=Kalai |first2=Gil |last3=Linial |first3=Nati |date=1988 |publisher=IEEE |book-title=Proc. 29th Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science |pages=68–80 |location=White Plains |conference=SFCS'88 |doi=10.1109/SFCS.1988.2192 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the ''KKL theorem'', states that if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Boolean then &lt;math&gt;\max_i \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = \Omega\left(\frac{\log n}{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

The bound given by the Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem is tight, and is achieved by the ''Tribes'' function of Ben-Or and Linial:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=Collective coin flipping, robust voting schemes and minima of Banzhaf values |last1=Ben-Or |first1=Michael |last2=Linial |first2=Nathan |date=1985 |publisher=IEEE |book-title=Proc. 26th Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science |pages=408–416 |location=Portland, Oregon |conference=SFCS'85 |doi=10.1109/SFCS.1985.15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; (x_{1,1} \land \cdots \land x_{1,w}) \lor \cdots \lor (x_{2^w,1} \land \cdots \land x_{2^w,w}). &lt;/math&gt;

The Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem was one of the first results in the area, and was the one introducing hypercontractivity into the context of Boolean functions.

===Friedgut's junta theorem===

If &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;-junta (a function depending on at most &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; coordinates) then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}[f] \leq M&lt;/math&gt; according to the Poincaré inequality.

Friedgut's theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedgut |first=Ehud |date=1998 |title=Boolean functions with low average sensitivity depend on few coordinates |journal=Combinatorica |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=474–483 |doi=10.1007/PL00009809}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a converse to this result. It states that for any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-close to a Boolean junta depending on &lt;math&gt;\exp (\operatorname{Inf}[f]/\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; coordinates.

Combined with the Russo–Margulis lemma, Friedgut's junta theorem implies that for every &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, every monotone function is close to a junta with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mu_q&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;q \approx p&lt;/math&gt;.

===Invariance principle===

The invariance principle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mossel |first1=Elchanan |last2=O'Donnell |first2=Ryan |last3=Oleszkiewicz |first3=Krzysztof |date=2010 |title=Noise stability of functions with low influences: Invariance and optimality |journal=Ann. Math. |volume=171 |issue=1 |pages=295–341 |doi=10.4007/annals.2010.171.295|arxiv=math/0503503 }}&lt;/ref&gt; generalizes the [[Berry–Esseen theorem]] to non-linear functions.

The Berry–Esseen theorem states (among else) that if &lt;math&gt;f = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i x_i&lt;/math&gt; and no &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; is too large compared to the rest, then the distribution of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is close to a normal distribution with the same mean and variance.

The invariance principle (in a special case) informally states that if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a multilinear polynomial of bounded degree over &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; and all influences of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; are small, then the distribution of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; under the uniform measure over &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is close to its distribution in Gaussian space.

More formally, let &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; be a univariate [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz function]], let &lt;math&gt;f = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \hat{f}(S) \chi_S&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;k=\deg f&lt;/math&gt;, and let
&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon = \max_i \sum_{S \ni i} \hat{f}(S)^2&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{S \neq \emptyset} \hat{f}(S)^2 \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;. Then

:&lt;math&gt; \left| \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \{-1,1\}^n} [\psi(f(x))] - \mathbb{E}_{g \sim N(0,I)} [\psi(f(g))] \right| = O(k9^k \varepsilon). &lt;/math&gt;

By choosing appropriate &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, this implies that the distributions of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; under both measures are close in [[Cumulative distribution function|CDF distance]], which is given by &lt;math&gt;\sup_t |\Pr[f(x)&lt;t] - \Pr[f(g)&lt;t]|&lt;/math&gt;.

The invariance principle was the key ingredient in the original proof of the [[#Majority is Stablest|''Majority is Stablest'' theorem]].

==Some applications==

===Linearity testing===

A Boolean function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; is ''linear'' if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;f(xy) = f(x)f(y)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;xy = (x_1y_1,\ldots,x_ny_n)&lt;/math&gt;. It is not hard to show that the Boolean linear functions are exactly the characters &lt;math&gt;\chi_S&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[property testing]] we want to test whether a given function is linear. It is natural to try the following test: choose &lt;math&gt;x,y \in \{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; uniformly at random, and check that &lt;math&gt;f(xy) = f(x)f(y)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is linear then it always passes the test. Blum, Luby and Rubinfeld&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blum |first1=Manuel |last2=Luby |first2=Michael |last3=Rubinfeld |first3=Ronitt |date=1993 |title=Self-testing/correcting with applications to numerical problems |journal=J. Comput. Syst. Sci. |volume=47 |number=3 |pages=549–595 |doi=10.1016/0022-0000(93)90044-W}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that if the test passes with probability &lt;math&gt;1-\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;O(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;-close to a Fourier character. Their proof was combinatorial.

Bellare et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Bellare |first1=Mihir |last2=Coppersmith |first2=Don |last3=Håstad |first3=Johan |last4=Kiwi |first4=Marcos |last5=Sudan |first5=Madhu |date=1995 |title= Linearity testing in characteristic two |booktitle = Proc. 36th Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science |conference=FOCS'95}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave an extremely simple Fourier-analytic proof, that also shows that if the test succeeds with probability &lt;math&gt;1/2 + \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is correlated with a Fourier character. Their proof relies on the following formula for the success probability of the test:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \hat{f}(S)^3. &lt;/math&gt;

===Arrow's theorem===

[[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] states that for three and more candidates, the only unanimous voting rule for which there is always a [[Condorcet criterion|Condorcet winner]] is a dictatorship.

The usual proof of Arrow's theorem is combinatorial. Kalai&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kalai |first=Gil |date=2002 |title=A Fourier-theoretic perspective on the Condorcet paradox and Arrow's theorem |journal=Adv. Appl. Math. |volume=29 |number=3 |pages=412–426 |doi=10.1016/S0196-8858(02)00023-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave an alternative proof of this result in the case of three candidates using Fourier analysis. If &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; is the rule that assigns a winner among two candidates given their relative orders in the votes, then the probability that there is a Condorcet winner given a uniformly random vote is &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{4} - \frac{3}{4} \operatorname{Stab}_{-1/3}[f]&lt;/math&gt;, from which the theorem easily follows.

The [[#Friedgut–Kalai–Naor theorem|FKN theorem]] implies that if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a rule for which there is almost always a Condorcet winner, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is close to a dictatorship.

===Sharp thresholds===

A classical result in the theory of [[random graph]]s states that the probability that a &lt;math&gt;G(n,p)&lt;/math&gt; random graph is connected tends to &lt;math&gt;e^{-e^{-c}}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;p \sim \frac{\log n + c}{n}&lt;/math&gt;. This is an example of a ''sharp threshold'': the width of the "threshold window", which is &lt;math&gt;O(1/n)&lt;/math&gt;, is asymptotically smaller than the threshold itself, which is roughly &lt;math&gt;\frac{\log n}{n}&lt;/math&gt;. In contrast, the probability that a &lt;math&gt;G(n,p)&lt;/math&gt; graph contains a triangle tends to &lt;math&gt;e^{-c^3/6}&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;p \sim \frac{c}{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Here both the threshold window and the threshold itself are &lt;math&gt;\Theta(1/n)&lt;/math&gt;, and so this is a ''coarse threshold''.

Friedgut's sharp threshold theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedgut |first=Ehud |date=1999 |title=Sharp thresholds of graph properties and the k-SAT problem |journal=J. Am. Math. Soc. |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=1017–1054 |doi=10.1090/S0894-0347-99-00305-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; states, roughly speaking, that a monotone graph property (a graph property is a property which doesn't depend on the names of the vertices) has a sharp threshold unless it is correlated with the appearance of small subgraphs. This theorem has been widely applied to analyze random graphs and [[percolation]].

On a related note, the [[#Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem|KKL theorem]] implies that the width of threshold window is always at most &lt;math&gt;O(1/\log n)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Friedgut |first1=Ehud |last2=Kalai |first2=Gil |date=1996 |title=Every monotone graph property has a sharp threshold |journal= Proc. Am. Math. Soc. |volume=124 |issue=10 |pages=2993–3002 |doi=10.1090/S0002-9939-96-03732-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Majority is Stablest===

Let &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Maj}_n\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; denote the majority function on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; coordinates. Sheppard's formula gives the asymptotic noise stability of majority:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Stab}_\rho[\operatorname{Maj}_n] \longrightarrow 1 - \frac{2}{\pi} \arccos \rho. &lt;/math&gt;

This is related to the probability that if we choose &lt;math&gt;x \in \{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; uniformly at random and form &lt;math&gt;y \in \{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; by flipping each bit of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;\frac{1-\rho}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, then the majority stays the same:
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Stab}_\rho[\operatorname{Maj}_n] = 2\Pr[\operatorname{Maj}_n(x) = \operatorname{Maj}_n(y)]-1&lt;/math&gt;.

There are Boolean functions with larger noise stability. For example, a dictatorship &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; has noise stability &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;.

The Majority is Stablest theorem states, informally, then the only functions having noise stability larger than majority have influential coordinates. Formally, for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;\tau &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that if &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; has expectation zero and &lt;math&gt;\max_i \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] \leq \tau&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Stab}_\rho[f] \leq 1 - \frac{2}{\pi} \arccos \rho + \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

The first proof of this theorem used the [[#Invariance principle|invariance principle]] in conjunction with an isoperimetric theorem of Borell in Gaussian space; since then more direct proofs were devised.

Majority is Stablest implies that the [[Semidefinite programming#Example 3 .28Goemans-Williamson MAX CUT approximation algorithm.29|Goemans–Williamson approximation algorithm]] for [[Maximum cut|MAX-CUT]] is optimal, assuming the [[unique games conjecture]]. This implication, due to Khot et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5353">In [[mathematical logic]], especially [[set theory]] and [[model theory]], the '''back-and-forth method''' is a method for showing [[isomorphism]] between [[countably infinite]] structures satisfying specified conditions. In particular:

* It can be used to prove that any two [[countably infinite]] [[dense order|densely ordered]] sets (i.e., linearly ordered in such a way that between any two members there is another) without endpoints are isomorphic. An isomorphism between [[linear order]]s is simply a strictly increasing [[bijection]]. This result implies, for example, that there exists a strictly increasing bijection between the set of all [[rational number]]s and the set of all [[real number|real]] [[algebraic number]]s.
* It can be used to prove that any two countably infinite atomless [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebras]] are isomorphic to each other.
* It can be used to prove that any two equivalent countable [[atomic model (mathematical logic)|atomic models]] of a theory are isomorphic.
* It can be used to prove that the [[Erdős–Rényi model]] of [[random graph]]s, when applied to countably infinite graphs, always produces a unique graph, the [[Rado graph]].
* It can be used to prove that any two [[m-complete]] [[recursively enumerable]] sets are [[computable function|recursively]] isomorphic.

== Application to densely ordered sets ==
Suppose that

* (''A'', ≤&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''B'', ≤&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;) are linearly ordered sets;
* They are both unbounded, in other words neither ''A'' nor ''B'' has either a maximum or a minimum;
* They are densely ordered, i.e. between any two members there is another;
* They are countably infinite.

Fix enumerations (without repetition) of the underlying sets:

:''A'' = { ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, … },
:''B'' = { ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, … }.

Now we construct a one-to-one correspondence between ''A'' and ''B'' that is strictly increasing. Initially no member of ''A'' is paired with any member of ''B''.

: '''(1)''' Let ''i'' be the smallest index such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is not yet paired with any member of ''B''. Let ''j'' be some index such that ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is not yet paired with any member of ''A'' '''and''' ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can be paired with ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; consistently with the requirement that the pairing be strictly increasing. Pair ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;.

: '''(2)''' Let ''j'' be the smallest index such that ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is not yet paired with any member of ''A''. Let ''i'' be some index such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is not yet paired with any member of ''B'' '''and''' ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; can be paired with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; consistently with the requirement that the pairing be strictly increasing. Pair ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

: '''(3)''' Go back to step '''(1)'''.

It still has to be checked that the choice required in step '''(1)''' and '''(2)''' can actually be made in accordance to the requirements. Using step '''(1)''' as an example:

If there are already ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''A'' corresponding to ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''B'' respectively such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;, we choose ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; in between ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; using density. Otherwise, we choose a suitable large or small element of ''B'' using the fact that ''B'' has neither a maximum nor a minimum. Choices made in step '''(2)''' are dually possible. Finally, the construction ends after countably many steps because ''A'' and ''B'' are countably infinite. Note that we had to use all the prerequisites.

== History ==
According to Hodges (1993):
:''Back-and-forth methods are often ascribed to [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Cooper Harold Langford|C. H. Langford]] […], but there is no evidence to support any of these attributions.''
While the theorem on countable densely ordered sets is due to Cantor (1895), the back-and-forth method with which it is now proved was developed by Huntington (1904) and Hausdorff (1914). Later it was applied in other situations, most notably by [[Roland Fraïssé]] in [[model theory]].

The '''chamfered dodecahedron''' is a [[convex set|convex]] [[polyhedron]] with 80 vertices, 120 edges, and 42 faces: 30 hexagons and 12 pentagons. It is constructed as a [[chamfer (geometry)]] (edge-truncation) of a [[regular dodecahedron]]. The pentagons are reduced in size and new hexagonal faces are added in place of all the original edges. Its dual is the [[pentakis icosidodecahedron]].

It is also called a '''truncated rhombic triacontahedron''', constructed as a [[Truncation (geometry)|truncation]] of the [[rhombic triacontahedron]]. It can more accurately be called an '''order-5 truncated rhombic triacontahedron''' because only the order-5 vertices are truncated.

== Structure==
These 12 order-5 vertices can be truncated such that all edges are equal length. The original 30 [[rhombus|rhombic]] faces become non-regular hexagons, and the truncated vertices become regular pentagons.

The hexagon faces can be [[equilateral]] but not [[regular polygon|regular]] with D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry. The angles at the two vertices with [[vertex configuration]] ''6.6.6'' are arccos(-1/sqrt(5)) = 116.565 degrees, and at the remaining four vertices with ''5.6.6'', they are 121.717 degrees each.

It is the [[Goldberg polyhedron]] G&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;(2,0), containing pentagonal and hexagonal faces.

It also represents the exterior envelope of a cell-centered [[orthogonal projection]] of the [[120-cell]], one of  six ([[Convex regular 4-polytope#Visualizations|convex regular 4-polytopes]]).

=== Chemistry ===

This is the shape of the [[fullerene]] C&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;; sometimes this shape is denoted C&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;(I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) to describe its icosahedral symmetry and distinguish it from other less-symmetric 80-vertex fullerenes. It is one of only four fullerenes found by {{harvtxt|Deza|Deza|Grishukhin|1998}} to have a [[skeleton (topology)|skeleton]] that can be isometrically embeddable into an [[Taxicab geometry|L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space]].

== Related polyhedra==
This polyhedron looks very similar to the uniform [[truncated icosahedron]] which has 12 pentagons, but only 20 hexagons.

The chamfered dodecahedron creates more polyhedra by basic [[Conway polyhedron notation]]. The zip chamfered dodecahedron makes a chamfered truncated icosahedron, and Goldberg (2,2).

In [[geometry]], the '''chamfered truncated icosahedron''' is a [[convex polygon|convex]] [[polyhedron]] with 240 vertices, 360 edges, and 122 faces, 110 hexagons and 12 pentagons.

It is constructed by a chamfer operation to the [[truncated icosahedron]], adding new hexagons in place of original edges. It can also be constructed as a zip (= dk = dual of kis of) operation from the ''chamfered dodecahedron''. In other words, raising pentagonal and hexagonal pyramids on a chamfered dodecahedron (kis operation) will yield the (2,2) [[geodesic polyhedron]]. Taking the dual of that yields the (2,2) [[Goldberg polyhedron]], which is the chamfered truncated icosahedron, and is also [[Fullerene]] C&lt;sub&gt;240&lt;/sub&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="739">In [[mathematics]], '''d'Alembert's equation''' is a first order nonlinear [[ordinary differential equation]], named after the French mathematician [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]].

:&lt;math&gt;y = x f(p) + g(p)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p=dy/dx&lt;/math&gt;. After differentiating once, and rearranging we have

The above equation is linear.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1760">Physics often deals with classical models where the dynamical variables are a collection of functions 
{''φ''&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt; over a d-dimensional space/spacetime [[manifold]] ''M'' where ''α'' is the "[[flavor (particle physics)|flavor]]" index. This involves [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]s over the ''φ'''s, [[functional derivative]]s, [[functional integral]]s, etc. From a functional point of view this is equivalent to working with an infinite-dimensional [[smooth manifold]] where its points are an assignment of a function for each ''α'', and the procedure is in analogy with [[differential geometry]] where the coordinates for a point ''x'' of the manifold ''M'' are ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'').

In the '''DeWitt notation''' (named after [[theoretical physicist]] [[Bryce DeWitt]]), φ&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') is written as φ&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; where ''i'' is now understood as an index covering both ''α'' and ''x''.

So, given a smooth functional ''A'', ''A''&lt;sub&gt;,''i''&lt;/sub&gt; stands for the [[functional derivative]]

:&lt;math&gt;A_{,i}[\phi] \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \frac{\delta}{\delta \phi^\alpha(x)}A[\phi]&lt;/math&gt;

as a functional of ''φ''. In other words, a "[[1-form]]" field over the infinite dimensional "functional manifold".

In integrals, the [[Einstein summation convention]] is used. Alternatively,

:&lt;math&gt;A^i B_i \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \int_M  \sum_\alpha A^\alpha(x) B_\alpha(x) d^dx&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1991">In the area of [[abstract algebra]] known as [[group theory]], the '''diameter''' of a [[finite group]] is a measure of its complexity.

Consider a finite group &lt;math&gt;\left(G,\circ\right)&lt;/math&gt;, and any [[generating set of a group|set of generators]] {{mvar|S}}. Define &lt;math&gt;D_S&lt;/math&gt; to be the [[graph diameter]] of the [[Cayley graph]] &lt;math&gt;\Lambda=\left(G,S\right)&lt;/math&gt;.  Then the diameter of &lt;math&gt;\left(G,\circ\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the largest value of &lt;math&gt;D_S&lt;/math&gt; taken over all generating sets {{mvar|S}}.

For instance, every finite [[cyclic group]] of order {{mvar|s}}, the Cayley graph for a generating set with one generator is an {{mvar|s}}-vertex [[cycle graph]]. The diameter of this graph, and of the group, is &lt;math&gt;\lfloor s/2\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{diam}(G) \leqslant \left(\log|G|\right)^{\mathcal{O}(1)}.

'''''Foundations of Differential Geometry''''' is an influential 2-volume mathematics book on [[differential geometry]] written by [[Shoshichi Kobayashi]] and [[Katsumi Nomizu]]. The first volume was published in 1963 and the second in 1969, by Interscience Publishers. Both were published again in 1996 as Wiley Classics Library.

The first volume considers [[manifold]]s, [[fiber bundle]]s, [[tensor analysis]], [[connection (mathematics)|connections in bundles]], and the role of [[Lie group]]s. It also covers [[holonomy]], the [[de Rham decomposition theorem]] and the [[Hopf–Rinow theorem]]. According to the review of [[James Eells]], it has a "fine expositional style" and consists of a "special blend of algebraic, analytic, and geometric concepts". Eells says it is "essentially a [[textbook]] (even though there are no [[exercise (mathematics)|exercise]]s)". An advanced text, it has a "pace geared to a [one] term graduate course".

The second volume considers [[submanifold]]s of [[Riemannian manifold]]s, the [[Gauss map]], and the [[second fundamental form]]. It continues with [[geodesic]]s on Riemannian manifolds, [[Jacobi field]]s, the [[Morse index]], the [[Rauch comparison theorem]]s, and the [[Cartan–Hadamard theorem]]. Then it ascends to [[complex manifold]]s, [[Kähler manifold]]s, [[homogeneous space]]s, and [[symmetric space]]s. In a discussion of [[Riemann curvature tensor|curvature]]  representation of [[characteristic class]]es of [[principal bundle]]s ([[Chern–Weil theory]]), it covers [[Euler class]]es, [[Chern class]]es, and [[Pontryagin class]]es. The second volume also received a favorable review by J. Eells in ''Mathematical Reviews''.

'''Foundations of mathematics''' is the study of the [[philosophy|philosophical]] and logical&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/369221/foundations-of-mathematics Joachim Lambek (2007), "Foundations of mathematics", ''Encyc. Britannica'']&lt;/ref&gt; and/or [[Algorithm|algorithmic]] basis of [[mathematics]], or, in a broader sense, the mathematical investigation of what underlies the philosophical theories concerning the nature of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philosophy-mathematics/#MatLogFouMat Leon Horsten (2007, rev. 2012), "Philosophy of Mathematics" ''SEP'']&lt;/ref&gt; In this latter sense, the distinction between foundations of mathematics and [[philosophy of mathematics]] turns out to be quite vague.
Foundations of mathematics can be conceived as the study of the basic mathematical concepts (set, function, geometrical figure, number, etc.) and how they form hierarchies of more complex structures and concepts, especially the fundamentally important structures that form the [[language of mathematics]] (formulas, theories and their [[model theory|models]] giving a meaning to formulas, definitions, proofs, algorithms, etc.) also called [[metamathematics|metamathematical concepts]], with an eye to the philosophical aspects and the unity of mathematics. The search for foundations of mathematics is a central question of the philosophy of mathematics; the abstract nature of mathematical objects presents special philosophical challenges.

The foundations of mathematics as a whole does not aim to contain the foundations of every mathematical topic.
Generally, the ''foundations'' of a field of study refers to a more-or-less systematic analysis of its most basic or fundamental concepts, its conceptual unity and its natural ordering or hierarchy of concepts, which may help to connect it with the rest of human knowledge. The development, emergence and clarification of the foundations can come late in the history of a field, and may not be viewed by everyone as its most interesting part.

Mathematics always played a special role in scientific thought, serving since ancient times as a model of truth and rigor for rational inquiry, and giving tools or even a foundation for other sciences (especially physics). Mathematics' many developments towards higher abstractions in the 19th century brought new challenges and paradoxes, urging for a deeper and more systematic examination of the nature and criteria of mathematical truth, as well as a unification of the diverse branches of mathematics into a coherent whole.

The systematic search for the foundations of mathematics started at the end of the 19th century and formed a new mathematical discipline called [[mathematical logic]], with strong links to [[theoretical computer science]].
It went through a series of crises with paradoxical results, until the discoveries stabilized during the 20th century as a large and coherent body of mathematical knowledge with several aspects or components ([[set theory]], [[model theory]], [[proof theory]], etc.), whose detailed properties and possible variants are still an active research field.
Its high level of technical sophistication inspired many philosophers to conjecture that it can serve as a model or pattern for the foundations of other sciences.

== Historical context ==
{{See also|History of logic|History of mathematics}}

=== Ancient Greek mathematics ===
{{Further|Ancient Greek mathematics}}

While the practice of mathematics had previously developed in other civilizations, special interest in its theoretical and foundational aspects was clearly evident in the work of the Ancient Greeks.

Early Greek philosophers disputed as to which is more basic, arithmetic or geometry.
[[Zeno of Elea]] (490{{snd}} c. 430&amp;nbsp;BC) produced four paradoxes that seem to show the impossibility of change. The [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean school of mathematics]] originally insisted that only natural and rational numbers exist. The discovery of the [[irrational number|irrationality]] of {{radic|2}}, the ratio of the diagonal of a square to its side (around 5th century&amp;nbsp;BC), was a shock to them which they only reluctantly accepted. The discrepancy between rationals and reals was finally resolved by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] (408–355&amp;nbsp;BC), a student of [[Plato]], who reduced the comparison of irrational ratios to comparisons of multiples (rational ratios), thus anticipating the definition of real numbers by [[Richard Dedekind]] (1831&amp;ndash;1916).

In the ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'', [[Aristotle]] (384–322&amp;nbsp;BC) laid down the [[axiomatic method]] for organizing a field of knowledge logically by means of primitive concepts, axioms, postulates, definitions, and theorems. Aristotle took a majority of his examples for this from arithmetic and from geometry.
This method reached its high point with [[Euclid]]'s [[Euclid's Elements|''Elements'']] (300&amp;nbsp;BC), a treatise on mathematics structured with very high standards of rigor: Euclid justifies each proposition by a demonstration in the form of chains of [[syllogisms]] (though they do not always conform strictly to Aristotelian templates).
Aristotle's syllogistic logic, together with the axiomatic method exemplified by Euclid's ''Elements'', are recognized as scientific achievements of ancient Greece.

=== Platonism as a traditional philosophy of mathematics ===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
{{Further|Platonism (mathematics)}}

Starting from the end of the 19th century, a Platonist view of mathematics became common among practicing mathematicians.

The ''concepts'' or, as Platonists would have it, the ''objects'' of mathematics are abstract and remote from everyday perceptual experience: geometrical figures are conceived as idealities to be distinguished from effective drawings and shapes of objects, and numbers are not confused with the counting of concrete objects. Their existence and nature present special philosophical challenges: How do mathematical objects differ from their concrete representation? Are they located in their representation, or in our minds, or somewhere else? How can we know them?

The ancient Greek philosophers took such questions very seriously. Indeed, many of their general philosophical discussions were carried on with extensive reference to geometry and arithmetic. [[Plato]] (424/423&amp;nbsp;BC{{snd}} 348/347&amp;nbsp;BC) insisted that mathematical objects, like other platonic ''Ideas'' (forms or essences), must be perfectly abstract and have a separate, non-material kind of existence, in a world of mathematical objects independent of humans. He believed that the truths about these objects also exist independently of the human mind, but is ''discovered'' by humans. In the ''[[Meno]]'' Plato's teacher Socrates asserts that it is possible to come to know this truth by a process akin to memory retrieval.

Above the gateway to Plato's academy appeared a famous inscription: "Let no one who is ignorant of geometry enter here". In this way Plato indicated his high opinion of geometry. He regarded geometry as "the first essential in the training of philosophers", because of its abstract character.

This philosophy of ''[[Platonism (mathematics)|Platonist mathematical realism]]'' is shared by many mathematicians. It can be argued that Platonism somehow comes as a necessary assumption underlying any mathematical work.&lt;ref name="Podnieks"&gt;Karlis Podnieks, [http://www.ltn.lv/~podnieks/gt1.html#BM1_1 Platonism, intuition and the nature of mathematics: 1. Platonism - the Philosophy of Working Mathematicians]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this view, the laws of nature and the laws of mathematics have a similar status, and the [[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences|effectiveness]] ceases to be unreasonable. Not our axioms, but the very real world of mathematical objects forms the foundation.

Aristotle dissected and rejected this view in his [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]. These questions provide much fuel for philosophical analysis and debate.

=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===
For over 2,000 years, Euclid's Elements stood as a perfectly solid foundation for mathematics, as its methodology of rational exploration guided mathematicians, philosophers, and scientists well into the 19th century.

The Middle Ages saw a dispute over the ontological status of the universals (platonic Ideas): [[Philosophical realism|Realism]] asserted their existence independently of perception; [[conceptualism]] asserted their existence within the mind only; [[nominalism]] denied either, only seeing universals as names of collections of individual objects (following older speculations that they are words, "''logoi''").

[[René Descartes]] published ''[[La Géométrie]]'' (1637), aimed at reducing geometry to algebra by means of coordinate systems, giving algebra a more foundational role (while the Greeks embedded arithmetic into geometry by identifying whole numbers with evenly spaced points on a line). Descartes' book became famous after 1649 and paved the way to infinitesimal calculus.

[[Isaac Newton]] (1642–1727) in England and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] (1646–1716) in Germany independently developed the [[infinitesimal calculus]] based on heuristic methods greatly efficient, but direly lacking rigorous justifications. Leibniz even went on to explicitly describe infinitesimals as actual infinitely small numbers (close to zero). Leibniz also worked on formal logic but most of his writings on it remained unpublished until 1903.

The Protestant philosopher [[George Berkeley]] (1685–1753), in his campaign against the religious implications of Newtonian mechanics, wrote a pamphlet on the lack of rational justifications of infinitesimal calculus:&lt;ref name="berkeley"&gt;''[[The Analyst]], A Discourse Addressed to an Infidel Mathematician''&lt;/ref&gt; "They are neither finite quantities, nor quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we not call them the ghosts of departed quantities?"

Then mathematics developed very rapidly and successfully in physical applications, but with little attention to logical foundations.

=== 19th century ===
In the [[History of mathematics#19th century|19th century]], mathematics became increasingly abstract. Concerns about logical gaps and inconsistencies in different fields led to the development of axiomatic systems.

==== Real analysis ====
{{See also|Mathematical analysis#History}}

[[Cauchy]] (1789–1857) started the project of formulating and proving the theorems of [[infinitesimal calculus]] in a rigorous manner, rejecting the heuristic principle of the [[generality of algebra]] exploited by earlier authors. In his 1821 work ''[[Cours d'Analyse]]'' he defines [[infinitesimal|infinitely small quantities]] in terms of decreasing sequences that converge to 0, which he then used to define continuity. But he did not formalize his notion of convergence.

The modern [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]] and [[continuous functions]] was first developed by [[Bernard Bolzano|Bolzano]] in 1817, but remained relatively unknown. It gives a rigorous foundation of infinitesimal calculus based on the set of real numbers, arguably resolving the Zeno paradoxes and Berkeley's arguments.

Mathematicians such as [[Karl Weierstrass]] (1815–1897) discovered pathological functions such as [[Weierstrass function|continuous, nowhere-differentiable functions]]. Previous conceptions of a function as a rule for computation, or a smooth graph, were no longer adequate. Weierstrass began to advocate the [[arithmetization of analysis]], to axiomatize analysis using properties of the natural numbers.

In 1858, [[Dedekind]] proposed a definition of the real numbers as [[Dedekind cuts|cuts]] of rational numbers. This reduction of real numbers and continuous functions in terms of rational numbers, and thus of natural numbers, was later integrated by [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]] in his set theory, and axiomatized in terms of [[second order arithmetic]] by Hilbert and Bernays.

==== Group theory ====
{{See also|History of group theory}}

For the first time, the limits of mathematics were explored. [[Niels Henrik Abel]] (1802–1829), a Norwegian, and [[Évariste Galois]], (1811–1832) a Frenchman, investigated the solutions of various polynomial equations, and proved that there is no general algebraic solution to equations of degree greater than four ([[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]). With these concepts, [[Pierre Wantzel]] (1837) proved that straightedge and compass alone cannot [[trisect an arbitrary angle]] nor [[Doubling the cube|double a cube]]. In 1882, [[Ferdinand von Lindemann|Lindemann]] building on the work of [[Charles Hermite|Hermite]] showed that a straightedge and compass [[quadrature of the circle]] (construction of a square equal in area to a given circle) was also impossible by proving that [[Pi|{{pi}}]] is a [[transcendental number]]. Mathematicians had attempted to solve all of these problems in vain since the time of the ancient Greeks.

Abel and Galois's works opened the way for the developments of [[group theory]] (which would later be used to study [[symmetry]] in physics and other fields), and [[abstract algebra]]. Concepts of [[vector spaces]] emerged from the conception of [[barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|barycentric coordinates]] by [[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]] in 1827, to the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps by Peano in 1888. Geometry was no more limited to three dimensions.
These concepts did not generalize numbers but combined notions of functions and sets which were not yet formalized, breaking away from familiar mathematical objects.

==== Non-Euclidean geometries ====
{{See also|Non-Euclidean geometry#History}}

After many failed attempts to derive the [[parallel postulate]] from other axioms, the study of the still hypothetical [[hyperbolic geometry]] by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] (1728–1777) led him to introduce the [[hyperbolic functions]] and compute the area of a [[hyperbolic triangle]] (where the sum of angles is less than 180°). Then the Russian mathematician [[Nikolai Lobachevsky]] (1792–1856) established in 1826 (and published in 1829) the coherence of this geometry (thus the independence of the [[parallel postulate]]), in parallel with the Hungarian mathematician [[János Bolyai]] (1802–1860) in 1832, and with [[Gauss]].
Later in the 19th century, the German mathematician [[Bernhard Riemann]] developed [[Elliptic geometry]], another [[non-Euclidean geometry]] where no parallel can be found and the sum of angles in a triangle is more than 180°. It was proved consistent by defining point to mean a pair of antipodal points on a fixed sphere and line to mean a [[great circle]] on the sphere. At that time, the main method for proving the consistency of a set of axioms was to provide a [[model (mathematical logic)|model]] for it.

==== Projective geometry ====
One of the traps in a [[deductive system]] is [[circular reasoning]], a problem that seemed to befall [[projective geometry]] until it was resolved by [[Karl von Staudt]]. As explained by Russian historians:&lt;ref&gt;Laptev, B.L. &amp; B.A. Rozenfel'd (1996) ''Mathematics of the 19th Century: Geometry'', page 40, [[Springer Science+Business Media|Birkhäuser]] {{ISBN|3-7643-5048-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In the mid-nineteenth century there was an acrimonious controversy between the proponents of synthetic and analytic methods in projective geometry, the two sides accusing each other of mixing projective and metric concepts. Indeed the basic concept that is applied in the synthetic presentation of projective geometry, the [[cross-ratio]] of four points of a line, was introduced through consideration of the lengths of intervals.}}

The purely geometric approach of von Staudt was based on the [[complete quadrilateral]] to express the relation of [[projective harmonic conjugate]]s. Then he created a means of expressing the familiar numeric properties with his [[Karl von Staudt#Algebra of throws|Algebra of Throws]]. English language versions of this process of deducing the properties of a [[field (mathematics)|field]] can be found in either the book by [[Oswald Veblen]] and John Young, ''Projective Geometry'' (1938), or more recently in [[John Stillwell]]'s ''Four Pillars of Geometry'' (2005). Stillwell writes on page 120

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;projective geometry is ''simpler'' than algebra in a certain sense, because we use only five geometric axioms to derive the nine field axioms.}}

The algebra of throws is commonly seen as a feature of cross-ratios since students ordinarily rely upon [[number]]s without worry about their basis. However, cross-ratio calculations use [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] features of geometry, features not admitted by purists. For instance, in 1961 [[Coxeter]] wrote ''Introduction to Geometry'' without mention of cross-ratio.

==== Boolean algebra and logic ====
Attempts of formal treatment of mathematics had started with Leibniz and [[Johann Heinrich Lambert|Lambert]] (1728–1777), and continued with works by algebraists such as [[George Peacock]] (1791–1858).
Systematic mathematical treatments of logic came with the British mathematician [[George Boole]] (1847) who devised an algebra that soon evolved into what is now called [[Boolean algebra]], in which the only numbers were 0 and 1 and logical combinations (conjunction, disjunction, implication and negation) are operations similar to the addition and multiplication of integers. Additionally, [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]] published his [[De Morgan's laws|laws]] in 1847. Logic thus became a branch of mathematics. Boolean algebra is the starting point of mathematical logic and has important applications in [[computer science]].

[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] built upon the work of Boole to develop a logical system for [[Relation (logic)|relations]] and [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]], which he published in several papers from 1870 to 1885.

The German mathematician [[Gottlob Frege]] (1848–1925) presented an independent development of logic with quantifiers in his [[Begriffsschrift]] (formula language) published in 1879, a work generally considered as marking a turning point in the history of logic. He exposed deficiencies in Aristotle's ''Logic'', and pointed out the three expected properties of a mathematical theory:

# [[Consistency]]: impossibility of proving contradictory statements.
# [[Completeness (logic)|Completeness]]: any statement is either provable or refutable (i.e. its negation is provable).
# [[Decidability (logic)|Decidability]]: there is a decision procedure to test any statement in the theory.

He then showed in ''Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (Basic Laws of Arithmetic)'' how arithmetic could be formalised in his new logic.

Frege's work was popularized by [[Bertrand Russell]] near the turn of the century. But Frege's two-dimensional notation had no success. Popular notations were (x) for universal and (∃x) for existential quantifiers, coming from [[Giuseppe Peano]] and [[William Ernest Johnson]] until the ∀ symbol was introduced by [[Gerhard Gentzen]] in 1935 and became canonical in the 1960s.

From 1890 to 1905, [[Ernst Schröder]] published ''Vorlesungen über die Algebra der Logik'' in three volumes. This work summarized and extended the work of Boole, De Morgan, and Peirce, and was a comprehensive reference to [[Mathematical_logic#Symbolic_logic|symbolic logic]] as it was understood at the end of the 19th century.

==== Peano arithmetic ====
{{Main|Peano arithmetic}}

The formalization of [[arithmetic]] (the theory of [[natural numbers]]) as an axiomatic theory started with Peirce in 1881 and continued with Richard Dedekind and [[Giuseppe Peano]] in 1888. This was still a [[Second-order logic|second-order]] axiomatization (expressing induction in terms of arbitrary subsets, thus with an implicit use of [[set theory]]) as concerns for expressing theories in [[first-order logic]] were not yet understood. In Dedekind's work, this approach appears as completely characterizing natural numbers and providing recursive definitions of addition and multiplication from the [[successor function]] and [[mathematical induction]].

== Foundational crisis&lt;!-- 'Foundational crisis of mathematics' redirects here --&gt; ==
The '''foundational crisis of mathematics'''&lt;!-- boldface per WP:R#PLA --&gt; (in [[German language|German]] ''Grundlagenkrise der Mathematik'') was the early 20th century's term for the search for proper foundations of mathematics.

Several schools of the [[philosophy of mathematics]] ran into difficulties one after the other in the 20th century, as the assumption that mathematics had any foundation that could be [[consistent]]ly stated within mathematics itself was heavily challenged by the discovery of various [[paradox]]es (such as [[Russell's paradox]]).

The name ''"paradox"'' should not be confused with ''contradiction''. A [[contradiction]] in a formal theory is a formal proof of an absurdity inside the theory (such as {{math|1=2 + 2 = 5}}), showing that this theory is [[inconsistent]] and must be rejected. But a paradox may be either a surprising but true result in a given formal theory, or an informal argument leading to a contradiction, so that a candidate theory, if it is to be formalized, must disallow at least one of its steps; in this case the problem is to find a satisfying theory without contradiction. Both meanings may apply if the formalized version of the argument forms the proof of a surprising truth. For instance, Russell's paradox may be expressed as "there is no set of all sets" (except in some marginal axiomatic set theories).

Various schools of thought opposed each other. The leading school was that of the [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist]] approach, of which [[David Hilbert]] was the foremost proponent, culminating in what is known as [[Hilbert's program]], which thought to ground mathematics on a small basis of a logical system proved sound by [[Metamathematics|metamathematical]] [[Finitism|finitistic]] means. The main opponent was the [[intuitionism|intuitionist]] school, led by [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], which resolutely discarded formalism as a meaningless game with symbols (van Dalen, 2008). The fight was acrimonious. In 1920 Hilbert succeeded in having Brouwer, whom he considered a threat to mathematics, removed from the editorial board of ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]'', the leading mathematical journal of the time.

=== Philosophical views ===
{{Main|Philosophy of mathematics}}

At the beginning of the 20th century, three schools of philosophy of mathematics opposed each other: Formalism, Intuitionism and Logicism.

==== Formalism ====
{{Main|Formalism (mathematics)}}

It has been claimed that formalists, such as [[David Hilbert]] (1862&amp;ndash;1943), hold that mathematics is only a language and a series of games. Indeed, he used the words "formula game" in his 1927 response to [[L. E. J. Brouwer]]'s criticisms:

{{quote|And to what extent has the formula game thus made possible been successful? This formula game enables us to express the entire thought-content of the science of mathematics in a uniform manner and develop it in such a way that, at the same time, the interconnections between the individual propositions and facts become clear ... The formula game that Brouwer so deprecates has, besides its mathematical value, an important general philosophical significance. For this formula game is carried out according to certain definite rules, in which the ''technique of our thinking'' is expressed. These rules form a closed system that can be discovered and definitively stated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Hilbert 1927 ''The Foundations of Mathematics'' in van Heijenoort 1967:475&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus Hilbert is insisting that mathematics is not an ''arbitrary'' game with ''arbitrary'' rules; rather it must agree with how our thinking, and then our speaking and writing, proceeds.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

{{quote|We are not speaking here of arbitrariness in any sense. Mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules. Rather, it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;p. 14 in Hilbert, D. (1919–20), Natur und Mathematisches Erkennen: Vorlesungen, gehalten 1919–1920 in Göttingen. Nach der Ausarbeitung von Paul Bernays (Edited and with an English introduction by David E. Rowe), Basel, Birkhauser (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The foundational philosophy of formalism, as exemplified by [[David Hilbert]], is a response to the paradoxes of [[set theory]], and is based on [[formal logic]]. Virtually all mathematical [[theorem]]s today can be formulated as theorems of set theory. The truth of a mathematical statement, in this view, is represented by the fact that the statement can be derived from the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|axioms of set theory]] using the rules of formal logic.

Merely the use of formalism alone does not explain several issues: why we should use the axioms we do and not some others, why we should employ the logical rules we do and not some others, why do "true" mathematical statements (e.g., the [[Peano axioms|laws of arithmetic]]) appear to be true, and so on. [[Hermann Weyl]] would ask these very questions of Hilbert:

{{quote|What "truth" or objectivity can be ascribed to this theoretic construction of the world, which presses far beyond the given, is a profound philosophical problem. It is closely connected with the further question: what impels us to take as a basis precisely the particular axiom system developed by Hilbert? Consistency is indeed a necessary but not a sufficient condition. For the time being we probably cannot answer this question ...&lt;ref&gt;Weyl 1927 ''Comments on Hilbert's second lecture on the foundations of mathematics'' in van Heijenoort 1967:484. Although Weyl the intuitionist believed that "Hilbert's view" would ultimately prevail, this would come with a significant loss to philosophy: "''I see in this a decisive defeat of the philosophical attitude of pure phenomenology'', which thus proves to be insufficient for the understanding of creative science even in the area of cognition that is most primal and most readily open to evidence{{snd}} mathematics" (ibid).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In some cases these questions may be sufficiently answered through the study of formal theories, in disciplines such as [[reverse mathematics]] and [[computational complexity theory]]. As noted by Weyl, [[formal logical system]]s also run the risk of [[consistency proof|inconsistency]]; in [[Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]], this arguably has already been settled with several proofs of [[consistency proof|consistency]], but there is debate over whether or not they are sufficiently [[finitism|finitary]] to be meaningful. [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|Gödel's second incompleteness theorem]] establishes that logical systems of arithmetic can never contain a valid proof of their own [[consistency proof|consistency]]. What Hilbert wanted to do was prove a logical system ''S'' was consistent, based on principles ''P'' that only made up a small part of ''S''. But Gödel proved that the principles ''P'' could not even prove ''P'' to be consistent, let alone ''S''.

==== Intuitionism ====
{{Main|Intuitionism|Constructivism (mathematics)}}

Intuitionists, such as [[L. E. J. Brouwer]] (1882–1966), hold that mathematics is a creation of the human mind. Numbers, like fairy tale characters, are merely mental entities, which would not exist if there were never any human minds to think about them.

The foundational philosophy of ''[[intuitionism]]'' or ''[[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]]'', as exemplified in the extreme by [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]] and [[Stephen Kleene]], requires proofs to be "constructive" in nature{{snd}} the existence of an object must be demonstrated rather than inferred from a demonstration of the impossibility of its non-existence. For example, as a consequence of this the form of proof known as [[reductio ad absurdum]] is suspect.

Some modern [[theory|theories]] in the philosophy of mathematics deny the existence of foundations in the original sense.  Some theories tend to focus on [[mathematical practice]], and aim to describe and analyze the actual working of mathematicians as a [[social group]]. Others try to create a [[cognitive science of mathematics]], focusing on human cognition as the origin of the reliability of mathematics when applied to the real world. These theories would propose to find foundations only in human thought, not in any objective outside construct. The matter remains controversial.

==== Logicism ====
{{Main|Logicism}}

[[Logicism]] is a school of thought, and research programme, in the philosophy of mathematics, based on the thesis that mathematics is an extension of a logic or that some or all mathematics may be derived in a suitable formal system whose axioms and rules of inference are 'logical' in nature . [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] championed this theory initiated by [[Gottlob Frege]] and influenced by [[Richard Dedekind]]

==== Set-theoretic Platonism ====
{{main|Set-theoretic Platonism}}
Many researchers in [[axiomatic set theory]] have subscribed to what is known as set-theoretic [[Platonism#Modern Platonism|Platonism]], exemplified by [[Kurt Gödel]].

Several set theorists followed this approach and actively searched for axioms that may be considered as true for heuristic reasons and that would decide the [[continuum hypothesis]]. Many [[large cardinal]] axioms were studied, but the hypothesis always remained [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] from them and it is now considered unlikely that CH can be resolved by a new large cardinal axiom. Other types of axioms were considered, but none of them has reached consensus on the continuum hypothesis yet. Recent work by [[Joel David Hamkins|Hamkins]] proposes a more flexible alternative: a set-theoretic [[multiverse]] allowing free passage between set-theoretic universes that satisfy the continuum hypothesis and other universes that do not.

==== Indispensability argument for realism ====
This [[Quine–Putnam indispensability thesis|argument]] by [[Willard Quine]] and [[Hilary Putnam]] says (in Putnam's shorter words),

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;quantification over mathematical entities is [[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences|indispensable for science]]&amp;nbsp;...; therefore we should accept such quantification; but this commits us to accepting the existence of the mathematical entities in question.}}

However Putnam was not a Platonist.

==== Rough-and-ready realism ====
Few mathematicians are typically concerned on a daily, working basis over logicism, formalism or any other philosophical position. Instead, their primary concern is that the mathematical enterprise as a whole always remains productive. Typically, they see this as insured by remaining open-minded, practical and busy; as potentially threatened by becoming overly-ideological, fanatically reductionistic or lazy. 

Such a view was has also been expressed by some well-known physicists.

For example, the Physics Nobel Prize laureate [[Richard Feynman]] said

{{quote|People say to me, "Are you looking for the ultimate laws of physics?" No, I'm not ... If it turns out there is a simple ultimate law which explains everything, so be it&amp;nbsp;– that would be very nice to discover. If it turns out it's like an onion with millions of layers ... then that's the way it is. But either way there's Nature and she's going to come out the way She is. So therefore when we go to investigate we shouldn't predecide what it is we're looking for only to find out more about it.&lt;ref name="fey1"&gt;Richard Feynman, ''The Pleasure of Finding Things Out'' p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And [[Steven Weinberg]]:&lt;ref name="weinberg"&gt;Steven Weinberg, chapter ''[http://libcom.org/library/unexpected-uselessness-philosophy Against Philosophy]'' wrote, in ''Dreams of a final theory&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The insights of philosophers have occasionally benefited physicists, but generally in a negative fashion – by protecting them from the preconceptions of other philosophers. ... without some guidance from our preconceptions one could do nothing at all. It is just that philosophical principles have not generally provided us with the right preconceptions.}}

Weinberg believed that any undecidability in mathematics, such as the continuum hypothesis, could be potentially resolved despite the incompleteness theorem, by finding suitable further axioms to add to set theory.

==== Philosophical consequences of Gödel's completeness theorem ====
{{Main|Gödel's completeness theorem}}

Gödel's completeness theorem establishes an equivalence in first-order logic between the formal provability of a formula and its truth in all possible models. Precisely, for any consistent first-order theory it gives an "explicit construction" of a model described by the theory; this model will be countable if the language of the theory is countable. However this "explicit construction" is not algorithmic. It is based on an iterative process of completion of the theory, where each step of the iteration consists in adding a formula to the axioms if it keeps the theory consistent; but this consistency question is only semi-decidable (an algorithm is available to find any contradiction but if there is none this consistency fact can remain unprovable).

This can be seen as a giving a sort of justification to the Platonist view that the objects of our mathematical theories are real. More precisely, it shows that the mere assumption of the existence of the set of natural numbers as a totality (an actual infinity) suffices to imply the existence of a model (a world of objects) of any consistent theory. However several difficulties remain:

* For any consistent theory this usually does not give just one world of objects, but an infinity of possible worlds that the theory might equally describe, with a possible diversity of truths between them.
* In the case of set theory, none of the models obtained by this construction resemble the intended model, as they are countable while set theory intends to describe uncountable infinities. Similar remarks can be made in many other cases. For example, with theories that include arithmetic, such constructions generally give models that include non-standard numbers, unless the construction method was specifically designed to avoid them.
* As it gives models to all consistent theories without distinction, it gives no reason to accept or reject any axiom as long as the theory remains consistent, but regards all consistent axiomatic theories as referring to equally existing worlds. It gives no indication on which axiomatic system should be preferred as a foundation of mathematics.
* As claims of consistency are usually unprovable, they remain a matter of belief or non-rigorous kinds of justifications. Hence the existence of models as given by the completeness theorem needs in fact two philosophical assumptions: the actual infinity of natural numbers and the consistency of the theory.

Another consequence of the completeness theorem is that it justifies the conception of infinitesimals as actual infinitely small nonzero quantities, based on the existence of non-standard models as equally legitimate to standard ones. This idea was formalized by [[Abraham Robinson]] into the theory of [[nonstandard analysis]].

=== More paradoxes ===
{{See also|List of statements independent of ZFC|List of paradoxes}}

*1920: [[Thoralf Skolem]] corrected [[Leopold Löwenheim]]'s proof of what is now called the [[downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]], leading to [[Skolem's paradox]] discussed in 1922, namely the existence of countable models of ZF, making infinite cardinalities a relative property.
*1922: Proof by [[Abraham Fraenkel]] that the [[axiom of choice]] cannot be proved from the axioms of [[Zermelo set theory]] with [[urelement]]s.
*1931: Publication of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]], showing that essential aspects of Hilbert's program could not be attained. It showed how to construct, for any sufficiently powerful and consistent recursively axiomatizable system{{snd}} such as necessary to axiomatize the elementary theory of [[arithmetic]] on the (infinite) set of natural numbers{{snd}} a statement that formally expresses its own unprovability, which he then proved equivalent to the claim of consistency of the theory; so that (assuming the consistency as true), the system is not powerful enough for proving its own consistency, let alone that a simpler system could do the job. It thus became clear that the notion of mathematical truth can not be completely determined and reduced to a purely [[formal system]] as envisaged in Hilbert's program. This dealt a final blow to the heart of Hilbert's program, the hope that consistency could be established by finitistic means (it was never made clear exactly what axioms were the "finitistic" ones, but whatever axiomatic system was being referred to, it was a 'weaker' system than the system whose consistency it was supposed to prove).
*1936: [[Alfred Tarski]] proved his [[Tarski's undefinability theorem|truth undefinability theorem]].
*1936: [[Alan Turing]] proved that a general algorithm to solve the [[halting problem]] for all possible program-input pairs cannot exist.
*1938: Gödel proved the [[Constructible universe|consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum hypothesis]].
*1936–1937: [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]], respectively, published independent papers showing that a general solution to the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] is impossible: the universal validity of statements in first-order logic is not decidable (it is only [[semi-decidable]] as given by the [[completeness theorem]]).
*1955: [[Pyotr Novikov]] showed that there exists a finitely presented group G such that the word problem for G is undecidable.
*1963: [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] showed that the Continuum Hypothesis is unprovable from [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]]. Cohen's proof developed the method of [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]], which is now an important tool for establishing [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independence]] results in set theory.
*1964: Inspired by the fundamental randomness in physics, [[Gregory Chaitin]] starts publishing results on algorithmic information theory (measuring incompleteness and randomness in mathematics).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Gregory |last=Chaitin |authorlink=Gregory Chaitin |url=https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~chaitin/sciamer3.pdf |title=The Limits Of Reason |year=2006 |accessdate=2016-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192140/https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~chaitin/sciamer3.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1966: Paul Cohen showed that the axiom of choice is unprovable in ZF even without [[urelements]].
*1970: [[Hilbert's tenth problem]] is proven unsolvable: there is no recursive solution to decide whether a [[Diophantine equation]] (multivariable polynomial equation) has a solution in integers.
*1971: [[Suslin's problem]] is proven to be independent from ZFC.

== Partial resolution of the crisis ==
Starting in 1935, the [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] group of French mathematicians started publishing a series of books to formalize many areas of mathematics on the new foundation of set theory.

The intuitionistic school did not attract many adherents, and it was not until [[Errett Bishop|Bishop]]'s work in 1967 that [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructive mathematics]] was placed on a sounder footing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Five stages of accepting constructive mathematics | author = Andrej Bauer | journal = Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. | volume = 54 | year = 2017 | doi = 10.1090/bull/1556 | page = 485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One may consider that [[Hilbert's program#Hilbert's program after Gödel|Hilbert's program has been partially completed]], so that the crisis is essentially resolved, satisfying ourselves with lower requirements than Hilbert's original ambitions. His ambitions were expressed in a time when nothing was clear: it was not clear whether mathematics could have a rigorous foundation at all.

There are many possible variants of set theory, which differ in consistency strength, where stronger versions (postulating higher types of infinities) contain formal proofs of the consistency of weaker versions, but none contains a formal proof of its own consistency. Thus the only thing we don't have is a formal proof of consistency of whatever version of set theory we may prefer, such as ZF.

In practice, most mathematicians either do not work from axiomatic systems, or if they do, do not doubt the consistency of [[ZFC]], generally their preferred axiomatic system. In most of mathematics as it is practiced, the incompleteness and paradoxes of the underlying formal theories never played a role anyway, and in those branches in which they do or whose formalization attempts would run the risk of forming inconsistent theories (such as logic and category theory), they may be treated carefully.

The development of [[category theory]] in the middle of the 20th century showed the usefulness of set theories guaranteeing the existence of larger classes than does ZFC, such as [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] or [[Tarski–Grothendieck set theory]], albeit that in very many cases the use of large cardinal axioms or Grothendieck Universes is formally eliminable.

One goal of the [[Reverse Mathematics]] program is to identify whether there are areas of 'core mathematics' in which foundational issues may again provoke a crisis.

There are three historical roots of [[group theory]]: the theory of [[algebraic equation]]s, [[number theory]] and [[geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Wussing|year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Kleiner|year = 1986|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Smith|year = 1906|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], [[Niels Henrik Abel]] and [[Évariste Galois]] were early researchers in the field of group theory.
&lt;!--
include summary of the post 1870 work here --&gt;

==Early 19th century==
The earliest study of groups as such probably goes back to the work of Lagrange in the late 18th century.  However, this work was somewhat isolated, and 1846 publications of [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] and Galois are more commonly referred to as the beginning of group theory.  The theory did not develop in a vacuum, and so three important threads in its pre-history are developed here.

===Development of permutation groups===
One foundational root of group theory was the quest of solutions of [[polynomial equation]]s of degree higher than 4. 

An early source occurs in the problem of forming an equation of degree ''m'' having as its roots ''m'' of the roots of a given equation of degree &lt;math&gt;n &gt; m&lt;/math&gt;. For simple cases the problem goes back to [[Johann van Waveren Hudde]] (1659). [[Nicholas Saunderson]] (1740) noted that the determination of the quadratic factors of a biquadratic expression necessarily leads to a sextic equation, and [[Le Sœur]]{{Ambiguous|date=August 2018}} (1748) and [[Edward Waring]] (1762 to 1782) still further elaborated the idea.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

A common foundation for the theory of equations on the basis of the group of [[permutations]] was found by Lagrange (1770, 1771), and on this was built the theory of substitutions. He discovered that the roots of all resolvents (''résolvantes, réduites'') which he examined are rational functions of the roots of the respective equations. To study the properties of these functions he invented a ''Calcul des Combinaisons''. The contemporary work of [[Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde]] (1770) also foreshadowed the coming theory.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

[[Paolo Ruffini]] (1799) attempted a proof of the impossibility of solving the [[Quintic equation|quintic]] and higher equations. Ruffini distinguished what are now called intransitive and  [[Group action#Types of actions|transitive]], and imprimitive and [[primitive permutation group|primitive]] groups, and (1801) uses the group of an equation under the name ''l'assieme delle permutazioni''. He also published a letter from [[Pietro Abbati]] to himself, in which the group idea is prominent.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

[[Image:Evariste galois.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Galois age fifteen, drawn by a classmate.]]
Galois found that if &lt;math&gt;r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n&lt;/math&gt; are the ''n'' roots of an equation, there is always a group of permutations of the ''r'''s such that 
*every function of the roots invariable by the substitutions of the group is rationally known, and
*conversely, every rationally determinable function of the roots is invariant under the substitutions of the group.
In modern terms, the [[solvable group|solvability]] of the Galois group attached to the equation determines the solvability of the equation with radicals.

Galois is the first to use the words ''group'' (''groupe'' in French) and ''primitive'' in their modern meanings. He did not use ''primitive group'' but called ''equation primitive'' an equation whose Galois group is [[primitive group|primitive]]. He discovered the notion of [[normal subgroup]]s and found that a solvable primitive group may be identified to a subgroup of the [[affine group]] of an [[affine space]] over a [[finite field]] of prime order.&lt;ref&gt;Galois last letter:http://www.galois.ihp.fr/ressources/vie-et-oeuvre-de-galois/lettres/lettre-testament&lt;/ref&gt;

Galois also contributed to the theory of [[modular equation]]s and to that of [[elliptic function]]s. His first publication on group theory was made at the age of eighteen (1829), but his contributions attracted little attention until the publication of his collected papers in 1846 (Liouville, Vol. XI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Galois|year = 1908|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Kleiner|year = 1986|loc = p. 202|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galois is honored as the first mathematician linking group theory and [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], with the theory that is now called [[Galois theory]].&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

Groups similar to Galois groups are (today) called [[permutation group]]s, a concept investigated in particular by Cauchy. A number of important theorems in early group theory are due to Cauchy. [[Arthur Cayley]]'s ''On the theory of groups, as depending on the symbolic equation &lt;math&gt;\theta^n = 1&lt;/math&gt;'' (1854) gives the first abstract definition of [[finite group]]s.

===Groups related to geometry===
[[Image:Felix Klein.jpeg|right|thumb|150px|Felix Klein]]
[[Image:Sophus Lie.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Sophus Lie]]
Secondly, the systematic use of groups in geometry, mainly in the guise of [[symmetry group]]s, was initiated by [[Felix Klein]]'s 1872 [[Erlangen program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Wussing|year = 2007|loc = &amp;#xa7;III.2|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of what are now called [[Lie group]]s started systematically in 1884 with [[Sophus Lie]], followed by work of [[Wilhelm Killing]], [[Eduard Study]], [[Issai Schur]], [[Ludwig Maurer]], and [[Élie Cartan]]. The discontinuous ([[discrete group]]) theory was built up by Klein, Lie, [[Henri Poincaré]], and [[Charles Émile Picard]], in connection in particular with [[modular form]]s and [[monodromy]].

===Appearance of groups in number theory===
[[Image:ErnstKummer.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Ernst Kummer]]
The third root of group theory was [[number theory]]. Certain [[abelian group]] structures had been implicitly used in [[number theory|number-theoretical]] work by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], and more explicitly by [[Leopold Kronecker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Kleiner|year = 1986|loc = p. 204|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early attempts to prove [[Fermat's last theorem]] were led to a climax by [[Ernst Kummer]] by introducing [[class group|groups describing factorization]] into [[prime number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Wussing|year = 2007|loc = &amp;#xa7;I.3.4|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convergence===
[[Image:Jordan 4.jpeg|left|thumb|150px|Camille Jordan]]
Group theory as an increasingly independent subject was popularized by [[Joseph Alfred Serret|Serret]], who devoted section IV of his algebra to the theory; by [[Camille Jordan]], whose ''[[List_of_important_publications_in_mathematics#Trait.C3.A9_des_substitutions_et_des_.C3.A9quations_alg.C3.A9briques|Traité des substitutions et des équations algébriques]]'' (1870) is a classic; and to [[Eugen Netto]] (1882), whose ''Theory of Substitutions and its Applications to Algebra'' was translated into English by Cole (1892). Other group theorists of the 19th century were [[Joseph Louis François Bertrand]], [[Charles Hermite]], [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius]], Kronecker, and [[Émile Léonard Mathieu|Émile Mathieu]];&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; as well as [[William Burnside]], [[Leonard Eugene Dickson]], [[Otto Hölder]], [[E. H. Moore]], [[Peter Ludwig Mejdell Sylow|Ludwig Sylow]], and [[Heinrich Martin Weber]].

The convergence of the above three sources into a uniform theory started with Jordan's ''Traité'' and [[Walther von Dyck]] (1882) who first defined a group in the full modern sense.  The textbooks of Weber and Burnside helped establish group theory as a discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon writes in Burnside's Collected Works, "The effect of [Burnside's book] was broader and more pervasive, influencing the entire course of non-commutative algebra in the twentieth century."&lt;/ref&gt;  The abstract group formulation did not apply to a large portion of 19th century group theory, and an alternative formalism was given in terms of [[Lie algebra]]s.

==Late 19th century==
Groups in the 1870-1900 period were described as the continuous groups of Lie, the discontinuous groups, finite groups of substitutions of roots (gradually being called permutations), and finite groups of linear substitutions (usually of finite fields).  During the 1880-1920 period, groups described by presentations came into a life of their own through the work of Cayley, [[Walther von Dyck]], [[Max Dehn]], [[Jakob Nielsen (mathematician)|Jakob Nielsen]], [[Otto Schreier]], and continued in the 1920-1940 period with the work of [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H. S. M. Coxeter]], [[Wilhelm Magnus]], and others to form the field of [[combinatorial group theory]].

Finite groups in the 1870-1900 period saw such highlights as the [[Sylow theorem]]s, Hölder's classification of groups of square-free order, and the early beginnings of the [[character theory]] of Frobenius. Already by 1860, the groups of automorphisms of the finite projective planes had been studied (by Mathieu), and in the 1870s Klein's group-theoretic vision of geometry was being realized in his [[Erlangen program]].  The automorphism groups of higher dimensional projective spaces were studied by Jordan in his ''Traité'' and included composition series for most of the so-called [[classical group]]s, though he avoided non-prime fields and omitted the [[unitary group]]s. The study was continued by Moore and Burnside, and brought into comprehensive textbook form by [[Leonard Dickson]] in 1901. The role of [[simple group]]s was emphasized by Jordan, and criteria for non-simplicity were developed by Hölder until he was able to classify the simple groups of order less than 200.  The study was continued by [[Frank Nelson Cole]] (up to 660) and Burnside (up to 1092), and finally in an early "millennium project", up to 2001 by Miller and Ling in 1900.

Continuous groups in the 1870-1900 period developed rapidly. Killing and Lie's foundational papers were published, Hilbert's theorem in invariant theory 1882, etc.  &lt;!-- When was the classification of semisimple Lie algebras finished? Here or in the next period?  Check Borel or Springer. --&gt;

==Early 20th century==
In the period 1900-1940, infinite "discontinuous" (now called [[discrete group]]s) groups gained life of their own.  Burnside's famous [[Burnside problem|problem]] ushered in the study of arbitrary subgroups of finite-dimensional linear groups over arbitrary fields, and indeed arbitrary groups.  [[Fundamental group]]s and [[reflection group]]s encouraged the developments of [[J. A. Todd]] and Coxeter, such as the [[Todd–Coxeter algorithm]] in combinatorial group theory.  [[Algebraic group]]s, defined as solutions of polynomial equations (rather than acting on them, as in the earlier century), benefited heavily from the continuous theory of Lie. [[Bernard Neumann]] and [[Hanna Neumann]] produced their study of [[Variety (universal algebra)|varieties of group]]s, groups defined by group theoretic equations rather than polynomial ones. &lt;!-- Baer also did some frightening stuff during this time.  Maybe also mention the developments of Abelian group theory during this time. --&gt;

Continuous groups also had explosive growth in the 1900-1940 period.  Topological groups began to be studied as such.  There were many great achievements in continuous groups: Cartan's classification of semisimple Lie algebras, [[Hermann Weyl]]'s theory of representations of compact groups, [[Alfréd Haar]]'s work in the locally compact case.

Finite groups in the 1900-1940 grew immensely.  This period witnessed the birth of [[character theory]] by Frobenius, Burnside, and Schur which helped answer many of the 19th century questions in permutation groups, and opened the way to entirely new techniques in abstract finite groups. This period saw the work of [[Philip Hall]]: on a generalization of Sylow's theorem to arbitrary sets of primes which revolutionized the study of finite soluble groups, and on the power-commutator structure of [[p-group]]s, including the ideas of [[regular p-group]]s and [[isoclinism of groups]], which revolutionized the study of p-groups and was the first major result in this area since Sylow. This period saw [[Hans Zassenhaus]]'s famous [[Schur-Zassenhaus theorem]] on the existence of complements to Hall's generalization of Sylow subgroups, as well as his progress on [[Frobenius group]]s, and a near classification of [[Zassenhaus group]]s. &lt;!-- Transfer results of Burnside, Frobenius, Schur, Grün.  Probably tons of other important things missing.  Check Wehrfritz for finite soluble. --&gt;

==Mid-20th century==
&lt;!-- 1940-1960 works well for several topics:
* finite groups:
** simple: includes Brauer but not Janko, missing at least some of Feit-Thompson-Suzki
** solbule: includes Wielandt, but not Carter,
* algebraic: includes Chevalley+Zariski, but I think not Tits,
* infinite:
** soluble: includes Hall, but I think not the more serious Grünberg stuff, with group rings and cohomology, check Robinson-Lennox
** check on when profinite got popular
** burnside problem: includes some progress
* continuous:
** locally compact: includes Mackey
** Lie: includes the Montgomery, Zippin regularity result

--&gt;

Both depth, breadth and also the impact of group theory subsequently grew. The domain started branching out into areas such as [[algebraic group]]s, [[group extension]]s, and [[representation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Curtis |year = 2003|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 1950s, in a huge collaborative effort, group theorists succeeded to [[classification of finite simple groups|classify]] all finite [[simple group]]s in 1982. Completing and simplifying the proof of the classification are areas of active research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Aschbacher|year = 2004|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anatoly Maltsev]] also made important contributions to group theory during this time; his early work was in logic in the 1930s, but in the 1940s he proved important embedding properties of semigroups into groups, studied the isomorphism problem of group rings, established the Malçev correspondence for polycyclic groups, and in the 1960s return to logic proving various theories within the study of groups to be undecidable.  Earlier, [[Alfred Tarski]] proved elementary group theory [[decision problem|undecidable]].&lt;ref&gt;Tarski, Alfred (1953) "Undecidability of the elementary theory of groups" in Tarski, Mostowski, and [[Raphael Robinson]] ''Undecidable Theories''. North-Holland: 77-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- 1960-1980
* Finite:
** Simple: all the sporadics, odd-order, full Feit, Thompson, Suzuki, Glauberman glory
** Soluble: Carter, Schunk, classes of groups
** ModCharTh: Green, Janusz, more Brauer
* Discrete:
** algebraic: Tits, Lang
** burnside: mostly finished I think
** combinatorial: Mal'cev
* Continuous:
** Profinite: definitely around, coclass conjectures made
** analytic: ?, check Mackey's history for the early part
** 

--&gt;
The period of 1960-1980 was one of excitement in many areas of group theory.

In finite groups, there were many independent milestones.  One had the discovery of 22 new sporadic groups, and the completion of the first generation of the [[classification of finite simple groups]].  One had the influential idea of the [[Carter subgroup]], and the subsequent creation of formation theory and the theory of classes of groups.  One had the remarkable extensions of Clifford theory by Green to the indecomposable modules of group algebras.  During this era, the field of [[computational group theory]] became a recognized field of study, due in part to its tremendous success during the first generation classification.

In discrete groups, the geometric methods of [[Jacques Tits]] and the availability the surjectivity of [[Serge Lang]]'s map allowed a revolution in algebraic groups.  The [[Burnside problem]] had tremendous progress, with better counterexamples constructed in the 1960s and early 1980s, but the finishing touches "for all but finitely many" were not completed until the 1990s.  The work on the Burnside problem increased interest in Lie algebras in exponent ''p'', and the methods of [[Michel Lazard]] began to see a wider impact, especially in the study of ''p''-groups.

Continuous groups broadened considerably, with ''p''-adic analytic questions becoming important.  Many conjectures were made during this time, including the coclass conjectures.

==Late 20th century==
&lt;!-- 1980-2000
* Finite:
** Simple/ModRepTh: fusion systems, Puig's nilpotent blocks, amalgamation, post classification results
** Soluble: Doerk-Hawkes
** p-groups: completion of coclass proof
** CGT: grows from beginnings in the 70s to a full fledged discipline
** finite geometries: some important work here in this period
* Discrete: have to check some references. lots of progress on group rings of discrete groups
** geometry: Thurston's geometrization, orbifolds in general, knot theory in general
** combinatorial: automatic groups
** geometric: hyperbolic groups
* Continuous: have to check with an expert
--&gt;

The last twenty years of the 20th century enjoyed the successes of over one hundred years of study in group theory.

In finite groups, post classification results included the [[O'Nan–Scott theorem]], the Aschbacher classification, the classification of multiply transitive finite groups, the determination of the maximal subgroups of the simple groups and the corresponding classifications of [[primitive group]]s.  In finite geometry and combinatorics, many problems could now be settled.&lt;!-- list a few, should be a few in that 1981 proceedings, and in Cameron's textbook, and in the Design theory encyclopedia--&gt;  The modular representation theory entered a new era as the techniques of the classification were axiomatized, including fusion systems, Luis Puig's theory of pairs and nilpotent blocks.  The theory of finite soluble groups was likewise transformed by the influential book of Klaus Doerk and Trevor Hawkes which brought the theory of projectors and injectors to a wider audience.

In discrete groups, several areas of geometry came together to produce exciting new fields.  Work on [[knot theory]], [[orbifold]]s, [[hyperbolic manifold]]s, and groups acting on trees (the [[Bass–Serre theory]]), much enlivened the study of [[hyperbolic group]]s, [[automatic group]]s.  Questions such as [[William Thurston]]'s 1982 [[geometrization conjecture]], inspired entirely new techniques in [[geometric group theory]] and [[low-dimensional topology]], and was involved in the solution of one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]], the [[Poincaré conjecture]].

Continuous groups saw the solution of the problem of [[hearing the shape of a drum]] in 1992 using symmetry groups of the [[laplacian operator]].  Continuous techniques were applied to many aspects of group theory using [[function space]]s and [[quantum group]]s.  Many 18th and 19th century problems are now revisited in this more general setting, and many questions in the theory of the representations of groups have answers.

==Today==
&lt;!-- 2000-today
This part should not contain any details, but just indicate that group theory's history is still being written.
--&gt;

Group theory continues to be an intensely studied matter. Its importance to contemporary mathematics as a whole may be seen from the 2008 [[Abel Prize]], awarded to [[John Griggs Thompson]] and [[Jacques Tits]] for their contributions to group theory.

The '''Indiana Pi Bill''' is the popular name for bill #246 of the 1897 sitting of the [[Indiana General Assembly]], one of the most notorious attempts to establish [[mathematical truth]] by [[legislative fiat]]. Despite its name, the main result claimed by the bill is a method to [[Squaring the circle|square the circle]], rather than to establish a certain value for the mathematical constant [[pi|{{pi}}]], the ratio of the [[circumference]] of a circle to its [[diameter]]. The bill, written by amateur mathematician Edward J. Goodwin, does imply various incorrect values of {{pi}}, such as 3.2.

The bill never became law, due to the intervention of Professor [[C. A. Waldo]] of [[Purdue University]], who happened to be present in the legislature on the day it went up for a vote.

The impossibility of squaring the circle using only [[compass and straightedge constructions]], suspected since ancient times, was rigorously proven in 1882 by [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]]. Better approximations of {{pi}} than those implied by the bill have been known since ancient times.

== Legislative history ==
In 1894, [[Indiana]] physician and amateur mathematician Edward J. Goodwin (ca. 1825–1902&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dudley|1992|p=195}}, citing an obituary&lt;/ref&gt;) believed that he had discovered a correct way of squaring the circle.&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Goodwin (July 1894) "Quadrature of the circle," ''American Mathematical Monthly'', '''1'''(7):  246–248.
*  See: [http://www.agecon.purdue.edu/crd/localgov/Topics/Materials/Pi_Goodwin_AmMathMonthly_1894.pdf Purdue Agricultural Economics].
*  Reprinted in:  Lennart Berggren, Jonathan Borwein, and Peter Borwein, ''Pi:  A Source Book'', 3rd ed. (New York, New York:  Springer-Verlag, 2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=QlbzjN_5pDoC&amp;pg=PA230#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 230.]
*  See also:  Edward J. Goodwin (1895) "(A) The trisection of an angle; (B) Duplication of the cube," ''American Mathematical Monthly'', '''2''': 337.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a bill to state representative Taylor I. Record, which Record introduced in the House under the long title "A Bill for an act introducing a new mathematical truth and offered as a contribution to education to be used only by the State of Indiana free of cost by paying any royalties whatever on the same, provided it is accepted and adopted by the official action of the Legislature of 1897".

The text of the bill consists of a series of mathematical claims (detailed below), followed by a recitation of Goodwin's previous accomplishments:

{{quote|... his solutions of the [[trisection of the angle]], [[doubling the cube]] and [[squaring the circle|quadrature of the circle]] having been already accepted as contributions to science by the ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'' ... And be it remembered that these noted problems had been long since given up by scientific bodies as unsolvable mysteries and above man's ability to comprehend.}} 

Goodwin's "solutions" were indeed published in the ''American Mathematical Monthly'', though with a disclaimer of "published by request of the author".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/mamarim/mamarimhtml/ClearAFJ "Clearing the Misunderstanding Re My April Fool's `Joke'"], math.rutgers.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon its introduction in the [[Indiana House of Representatives]], the bill's language and topic occasioned confusion among the membership; a member from [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] proposed that it be referred to the Finance Committee, but the Speaker accepted another member's recommendation to refer the bill to the Committee on Swamplands, where the bill could "find a deserved grave".&lt;ref name=hallerburg&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://journals.iupui.edu/index.php/ias/article/download/8180/8139 |title=House Bill No. 246 Revisited|first=Arthur E.|last=Hallenberg|journal=Proceedings of the Indiana Academy of Science|pages=376–399|year=1974|volume=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|385}}  It was transferred to the Committee on Education, which reported favorably;&lt;ref name=purdue&gt;[http://www.agecon.purdue.edu/crd/Localgov/Second%20Level%20pages/Indiana_Pi_Story.htm Indiana pi story] at a Purdue server&lt;/ref&gt; following a motion to [[Suspension of the rules|suspend the rules]], the bill passed on February 6,&lt;ref name=hallerburg /&gt;{{rp|390}} without a dissenting vote.&lt;ref name=purdue /&gt;  The news of the bill occasioned an alarmed response from ''Der Tägliche Telegraph'', a [[German language|German-language]] newspaper in Indianapolis, which viewed the event with significantly less favor than its English-speaking competitors.&lt;ref name=hallerburg /&gt;{{rp|385}}  As this debate concluded, [[Purdue University]] Professor [[C. A. Waldo]] arrived in [[Indianapolis]] to secure the annual appropriation for the [[Indiana Academy of Science]]. An assemblyman handed him the bill, offering to introduce him to the genius who wrote it. He declined, saying that he already met as many crazy people as he cared to.&lt;ref name=purdue /&gt;&lt;ref name="waldo-ref"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waldo|first1=C. A.|title=What Might Have Been|journal=Proceedings of the Indiana Academy of Science|date=1916|pages=445–446|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/14641808#page/455/|accessdate=24 April 2017|ref=waldo-ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it reached the [[Indiana Senate]], the bill was not treated so kindly, for Waldo had coached the senators previously.  The committee to which it had been assigned reported it unfavorably, and the Senate [[Table (parliamentary procedure)|tabled]] it on February 12;&lt;ref name=hallerburg /&gt;{{rp|386}} it was nearly passed, but opinion changed when one senator observed that the General Assembly lacked the power to define mathematical truth.&lt;ref name=hallerburg /&gt;{{rp|391}}  Influencing some of the senators was a report that major newspapers, such as the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', had begun to ridicule the situation.&lt;ref name=hallerburg /&gt;{{rp|390}}

According to the ''Indianapolis News'' article of February 13, page 11, column 3:&lt;ref name="indianapolis-news"&gt;{{cite news|title=THE MATHEMATICAL BILL. Fun-Making In the Senate Yester-day Afternoon--Other Action.|url=https://newspapers.library.in.gov/cgi-bin/indiana?a=d&amp;d=INN18970213-01.1.11|accessdate=24 April 2017|work=Indianapolis News|date=13 February 1897|ref=indianapolis-news}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;... the bill was brought up and made fun of.  The Senators made bad puns about it, ridiculed it and laughed over it.  The fun lasted half an hour.  Senator Hubbell said that it was not meet for the Senate, which was costing the State $250 a day, to waste its time in such frivolity.  He said that in reading the leading newspapers of Chicago and the East, he found that the Indiana State Legislature had laid itself open to ridicule by the action already taken on the bill.  He thought consideration of such a proposition was not dignified or worthy of the Senate.  He moved the indefinite postponement of the bill, and the motion carried.&lt;ref name=purdue /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Mathematics ==

=== Approximation of π ===

Although the bill has become known as the "Pi Bill", its text does not mention the name "pi" at all, and Goodwin appears to have thought of the ratio between the circumference and diameter of a circle as distinctly secondary to his main aim of squaring the circle. Towards the end of Section 2 the following passage appears:

{{quote|Furthermore, it has revealed the ratio of the chord and arc of ninety degrees, which is as seven to eight, and also the ratio of the diagonal and one side of a square which is as ten to seven, disclosing the fourth important fact, that the ratio of the diameter and circumference is as five-fourths to four[.]&lt;ref name="bill_text"&gt;[http://www.agecon.purdue.edu/crd/Localgov/Second%20Level%20pages/indiana_pi_bill.htm Text of the bill]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This comes close to an explicit claim that &lt;math&gt;\pi = \frac{4}{1.25} = 3.2&lt;/math&gt;, and that &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{2} = \frac{10}{7} \approx 1.429&lt;/math&gt;.

This quotation is often read as three mutually incompatible assertions, but they fit together well if the statement about {{radic|2}} is taken to be about the inscribed square (with the circle's diameter as diagonal) rather than the square on the radius (with the chord of 90° as diagonal). Together they describe the circle shown in the figure, whose diameter is 10 and circumference is 32; the chord of 90° is taken to be 7. Both of the values 7 and 32 are within a few percent of the true lengths for a diameter-10 circle (which does not justify Goodwin's presentation of them as exact). The circumference should be nearer to 31.4159 and the diagonal "7" should be the [[square root]] of 50 (=25+25), or nearer to 7.071.

=== Area of the circle ===

Goodwin's main goal was not to measure lengths in the circle but to ''square'' it, which he interpreted literally as finding a square with the same area as the circle. He knew that [[Archimedes]]' formula for the area of a circle, which calls for multiplying the diameter by one fourth of the circumference, is not considered a solution to the ancient problem of [[squaring the circle]]. This is because the problem is to ''construct'' the area using [[compass and straightedge]] only, and Archimedes did not give a method for constructing a straight line with the same length as the circumference. Apparently, Goodwin was unaware of this central requirement; he believed that the problem with the Archimedean formula is that it gives wrong numerical results, and that a solution of the ancient problem should consist of replacing it with a "correct" formula. In the bill he proposed, without argument, his own method:

{{quote|It has been found that a circular area is to the square on a line equal to the quadrant of the circumference, as the area of an equilateral rectangle is to the square on one side.&lt;ref name="bill_text" /&gt;}}

This appears needlessly convoluted, as an "[[equilateral]] rectangle" is, by definition, a [[square]]. In simple terms, the assertion is that the area of a circle is the same as that of a square with the same perimeter. This claim results in other mathematical contradictions to which Goodwin attempts to respond. For example, right after the above quote the bill goes on to say:

{{quote|The diameter employed as the linear unit according to the present rule in computing the circle's area is entirely wrong, as it represents the circle's area one and one-fifth times the area of a square whose perimeter is equal to the circumference of the circle.}}

In the model circle above, the Archimedean area (accepting Goodwin's values for the circumference and diameter) would be 80, whereas Goodwin's proposed rule leads to an area of 64. Now, 80 exceeds 64 by one fifth ''of 80'', and Goodwin appears to confuse 64 = 80×(1−{{frac|5}}) with 80 = 64×(1+{{frac|5}}), an approximation that works only for fractions much smaller than {{frac|5}}.

The area found by Goodwin's rule is {{frac|{{pi}}|4}} times the true area of the circle, which in many accounts of the Pi Bill is interpreted as a claim that {{pi}} = 4. However, there is no internal evidence in the bill that Goodwin intended to make such a claim; on the contrary, he repeatedly denies that the area of the circle has anything to do with its diameter.

The relative ''area'' error of 1−{{frac|{{pi}}|4}} works out to about 21 percent, which is much more grave than the approximations of the ''lengths'' in the model circle of the previous section. It is unknown what made Goodwin believe that his rule could be correct. In general, figures with identical perimeters do not have identical area (see [[isoperimetry]]); the typical demonstration of this fact is to compare a long thin shape with a small enclosed area (the area approaching zero as the width decreases) to one of the same perimeter that is approximately as tall as it is wide (the area approaching the square of the width), obviously of much greater area.

In relation with the history of [[mathematics]], the '''Italian school of [[algebraic geometry]]''' refers to the work over half a century or more (flourishing roughly 1885–1935) done internationally in [[birational geometry]], particularly on [[algebraic surface]]s. There were in the region of 30 to 40 leading mathematicians who made major contributions, about half of those being in fact Italian. The leadership fell to the group in [[Rome]] of [[Guido Castelnuovo]], [[Federigo Enriques]] and [[Francesco Severi]], who were involved in some of the deepest discoveries, as well as setting the style.

==Algebraic surfaces==
The emphasis on [[algebraic surface]]s&amp;mdash;[[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] of [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]] two&amp;mdash;followed on from an essentially complete geometric theory of [[algebraic curve]]s (dimension 1). The position in around 1870 was that the curve theory had incorporated with [[Brill–Noether theory]] the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]] in all its refinements (via the detailed geometry of the [[theta-divisor]]).

The [[classification of algebraic surfaces]] was a bold and successful attempt to repeat the division of curves by their [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] ''g''. It corresponds to the rough classification into the three types: ''g'' = 0 (projective line); ''g'' = 1 ([[elliptic curve]]); and ''g'' &gt; 1 ([[Riemann surface]]s with independent holomorphic differentials). In the case of surfaces, the Enriques classification was into five similar big classes, with three of those being analogues of the curve cases, and two more (elliptic fibrations, and [[K3 surface]]s, as they would now be called) being with the case of two-dimension [[abelian variety|abelian varieties]] in the 'middle' territory. This was an essentially sound, breakthrough set of insights, recovered in modern [[complex manifold]] language by [[Kunihiko Kodaira]] in the 1950s, and refined to include mod p phenomena by [[Zariski]], the [[Shafarevich]] school and others by around 1960. The form of the [[Riemann–Roch theorem on a surface]] was also worked out.

==Foundational issues==
Some proofs produced by the school are not considered satisfactory because of foundational difficulties. These included frequent use of birational models in dimension three of surfaces that can have non-singular models only when embedded in higher-dimensional [[projective space]]. In order to avoid these issues, a sophisticated theory of handling a [[linear system of divisors]] was developed (in effect, a [[line bundle]] theory for hyperplane sections of putative embeddings in projective space). Many modern techniques were found, in embryonic form, and in some cases the articulation of these ideas exceeded the available technical language.

==The geometers==
According to Guerraggio &amp; Nastasi (page 9, 2005) [[Luigi Cremona]] is "considered the founder of the Italian school of algebraic geometry". Later they explain that in [[Turin]] the collaboration of [[Enrico D'Ovidio]] and [[Corrado Segre]] "would bring, either by their own efforts or those of their students, Italian algebraic geometry to full maturity". A one-time student of Segre, [[H.F. Baker]] wrote (1926, page 269), [Corrado Segre] "may probably be said to be the father of that wonderful Italian school which has achieved so much in the birational theory of algebraical loci." On this topic, Brigaglia &amp; Ciliberto (2004) say "Segre had headed and maintained the school of geometry that Luigi Cremona had established in 1860." Reference to the [[Mathematics Genealogy Project]] shows that, in terms of ''Italian doctorates'', the real productivity of the school began with [[Guido Castelnuovo]] and [[Federigo Enriques]]. In the USA [[Oscar Zariski]] inspired many Ph.D.s.

The roll of honour of the school includes the following other Italians: [[Giacomo Albanese]], [[Eugenio Bertini]], Luigi Campedelli, [[Oscar Chisini]], [[Michele De Franchis]], [[Pasquale del Pezzo]], [[Beniamino Segre]], [[Francesco Severi]], [[Guido Zappa]] (with contributions also from [[Gino Fano]], Carlo Rosati, Giuseppe Torelli, [[Giuseppe Veronese]]).

Elsewhere it involved [[H. F. Baker]] and [[Patrick du Val]] (UK), [[Arthur Byron Coble]] (USA), [[Georges Humbert]] and [[Charles Émile Picard]] (France), [[Lucien Godeaux]] (Belgium), [[Hermann Schubert]] and [[Max Noether]], and later [[Erich Kähler]] (Germany), [[H. G. Zeuthen]] (Denmark).

These figures were all involved in algebraic geometry, rather than the pursuit of [[projective geometry]] as [[synthetic geometry]], which during the period under discussion was a huge (in volume terms) but secondary subject (when judged by its importance as research).

==Advent of topology==
The new algebraic geometry that would succeed the Italian school was distinguished also by the intensive use of [[algebraic topology]]. The founder of that tendency was [[Henri Poincaré]]; during the 1930s it was developed by [[Lefschetz]], [[W. V. D. Hodge|Hodge]] and [[J. A. Todd|Todd]]. The modern synthesis brought together their work, that of the [[Henri Cartan|Cartan]] school, and of [[W.L. Chow]] and [[Kunihiko Kodaira]], with the traditional material.

==Collapse of the school==

{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}

In the earlier years of the Italian school under Castelnuovo, the standards of rigor were as high as most areas of mathematics. Under Enriques it gradually became acceptable to use somewhat more informal arguments instead of complete rigorous proofs, such as the "principle of continuity" saying that what is true up to the limit is true at the limit, a claim that had neither a rigorous proof nor even a precise statement. At first this did not matter too much, as Enriques's intuition was so good that essentially all the results he claimed were in fact correct, and using this more informal style of argument allowed him to produce spectacular results about algebraic surfaces. 
Unfortunately, from about 1930 onwards under Severi's leadership the standards of accuracy declined further, to the point where some of the claimed results were not just inadequately proved, but were hopelessly wrong. 
For example, in 1934 Severi claimed that the space of rational equivalence classes of cycles on an algebraic surface is finite-dimensional, but {{harvtxt|Mumford|1968}} showed that this is false for surfaces of positive geometric genus, and in 1946 Severi published a paper claiming to prove that a degree-6 surface in 3-dimensional projective space has at most 52 nodes, but the [[Barth sextic]] has 65 nodes.
Severi did not accept that his arguments were inadequate, leading to some acrimonious disputes as to the status of some results.

By about 1950 it had become too difficult to tell which of the results claimed were correct, and the informal intuitive school of algebraic geometry simply collapsed due to its inadequate foundations.
From about 1950 to 1980 there was  considerable effort to salvage as much as possible from the wreckage, and convert it into the rigorous algebraic style of algebraic geometry set up by Weil and Zariski. In particular in the 1960s Kodaira and Shafarevich and his students rewrote the [[Enriques classification]] of algebraic surfaces in a more rigorous style, and also extended it to all compact complex surfaces, while in the 1970s Fulton and MacPherson put the classical calculations of [[intersection theory]] on rigorous foundations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11834">'''[[Abstract algebra]]''' is the subject area of [[mathematics]] that studies [[algebraic structure]]s, such as [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[module (mathematics)|modules]], [[vector space]]s, and [[algebra over a field|algebras]]. The phrase '''abstract algebra''' was coined at the turn of the 20th century to distinguish this area from what was normally referred to as '''algebra''', the study of the rules for manipulating formulae and algebraic expressions involving unknowns and [[real numbers|real]] or [[complex number]]s, often now called ''[[elementary algebra]]''. The distinction is rarely made in more recent writings.

==Basic language==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1236">This is a '''list of exceptional set concepts'''. In [[mathematics]], and in particular in [[mathematical analysis]], it is very useful to be able to characterise [[subset]]s of a given set ''X'' as 'small', in some definite sense, or 'large' if their [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] in ''X'' is small. There are numerous concepts that have been introduced to study 'small' or 'exceptional' subsets. In the case of sets of [[natural number]]s, it is possible to define more than one concept of 'density', for example. See also [[list of properties of sets of reals]].

The following is a list of [[indefinite integral]]s ([[antiderivative]]s) of expressions involving the [[inverse trigonometric function]]s. For a complete list of integral formulas, see [[lists of integrals]].

* The inverse trigonometric functions are also known as the "arc functions".
* ''C'' is used for the arbitrary [[constant of integration]] that can only be determined if something about the value of the integral at some point is known. Thus each function has an infinite number of antiderivatives.
* There are three common notations for inverse trigonometric functions.  The arcsine function, for instance, could be written as ''sin&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''asin'', or, as is used on this page, ''arcsin''.
* For each inverse trigonometric integration formula below there is a corresponding formula in the [[list of integrals of inverse hyperbolic functions]].

A number of different formulae, more than hundred, have been proposed as means of calculating [[price index]]es.  While price index formulae all use price and possibly quantity data, they aggregate these in different ways.  A price index aggregates various combinations of base period prices (&lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt;), later period prices (&lt;math&gt;p_t&lt;/math&gt;), base period quantities (&lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt;), and later period quantities (&lt;math&gt;q_t&lt;/math&gt;). Price index numbers are usually defined either in terms of (actual or hypothetical) expenditures (expenditure = price * quantity) or as different weighted averages of price relatives (&lt;math&gt;p_t/p_0&lt;/math&gt;). These tell the relative change of the price in question. Two of the most commonly used price index formulae were defined by German economists and statisticians [[Étienne Laspeyres]] and [[Hermann Paasche]], both around 1875 when investigating price changes in Germany.

==Laspeyres==
Developed in 1871 by [[Étienne Laspeyres|Laspeyres]], the formula:
:&lt;math&gt; P_{L}=\frac{\sum\left(p_{t}\cdot q_{0}\right)}{\sum\left(p_{0}\cdot q_{0}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

compares the total cost of the same basket of goods &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt; at the old and new prices.

==Paasche==
Developed in 1874&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/cpi/1587.htm|title=Q&amp;A about the Consumer Price Index|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Hermann Paasche|Paasche]], the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;P_{P}=\frac{\sum\left(p_{t}\cdot q_{t}\right)}{\sum\left(p_{0}\cdot q_{t}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

compares the total cost of a new basket of goods &lt;math&gt;q_t&lt;/math&gt; at the old and new prices.

==Geometric means==
The geometric means index:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{GM}=\prod_{i=1}^{n}\left(\frac{p_{i,t}}{p_{i,0}}\right)^\frac{p_{i,0}\cdot q_{i,0}}{\sum\left(p_{0}\cdot q_{0}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

incorporates quantity information through the share of expenditure in the base period.

==Unweighted indices==
Unweighted, or "elementary", price indices only compare prices of a single type of good between two periods. They do not make any use of quantities or expenditure weights. They are called "elementary" because they are often used at the lower levels of aggregation for more comprehensive price indices.&lt;ref&gt;PPI manual, 598.&lt;/ref&gt; In such a case, they are not indices but merely an intermediate stage in the calculation of an index. At these lower levels, it is argued that weighting is not necessary since only one type of good is being aggregated. However this implicitly assumes that only one type of the good is available (e.g. only one brand and one package size of frozen peas) and that it has not changed in quality etc between time periods.

===Carli===
Developed in 1764 by [[Giovanni Rinaldo|Carli]], an Italian economist, this formula is the [[arithmetic mean]] of the price relative between a period ''t'' and a base period ''0''.{{Fix|text=The formula does not make clear over what the summation is done.}}
:&lt;math&gt;P_{C}=\frac{1}{n}\cdot\sum\frac{p_{t}}{p_{0}}&lt;/math&gt;

On 17 August 2012 the BBC Radio 4 program "More or Less" noted that the Carli index, used in part in the British Retail Price Index measure, has a built-in bias towards recording inflation even when over successive periods there is no increase in prices overall.{{clarifyme|date=November 2017}}{{Fix|text=Explain why}}

===Dutot===
In 1738 French economist Dutot&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagofed.org/~/media/publications/working-papers/2009/wp2009-10-pdf|title=The Life and Times of Nicolas Dutot|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed using an index calculated by dividing the average price in period ''t'' by the average price in period ''0''.
:&lt;math&gt;P_{D}=\frac{\frac{1}{n}\cdot\sum p_{t}}{\frac{1}{n}\cdot\sum p_{0}}=\frac{\sum p_{t}}{\sum p_{0}} &lt;/math&gt;

===Jevons===
In 1863, English economist [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]] proposed taking the [[geometric average]] of the price relative of period ''t'' and base period ''0''.&lt;ref&gt;PPI manual, 602.&lt;/ref&gt; When used as an elementary aggregate, the Jevons index is considered a constant elasticity of substitution index since it allows for product substitution between time periods.&lt;ref&gt;PPI manual, 596.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_{J}=\left(\prod\frac{p_{t}}{p_{0}}\right)^{1/n}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the formula that was used for the old Financial Times stock market index (the predecessor of the [[FTSE 100 Index]]). It was inadequate for that purpose. In particular, if the price of any of the constituents were to fall to zero, the whole index would fall to zero. That is an extreme case; in general the formula will understate the total cost of a basket of goods (or of any subset of that basket) unless their prices all change at the same rate. Also, as the index is unweighted, large price changes in selected constituents can transmit to the index to an extent not representing their importance in the average portfolio.

===Harmonic mean of price relatives===
The harmonic average counterpart to the Carli index.&lt;ref name="PPI manual, 600"&gt;PPI manual, 600.&lt;/ref&gt;  The index was proposed by Jevons in 1865 and by Coggeshall in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Export and Import manual, Chapter 20 p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_{HR}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{n}\cdot\sum\frac{p_{0}}{p_{t}}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Carruthers, Sellwood, Ward, Dalén index===
Is the geometric mean of the Carli and the harmonic price indexes.&lt;ref&gt;PPI manual, 597.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1922 Fisher wrote that this and the Jevons were the two best unweighted indexes based on Fisher's test approach to index number theory.&lt;ref&gt;Export and Import manual, Chapter 20, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_{CSWD}=\sqrt{P_{C}\cdot P_{HR}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Ratio of harmonic means===
The ratio of harmonic means or "Harmonic means" price index is the harmonic average counterpart to the Dutot index.&lt;ref name="PPI manual, 600"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_{RH}=\frac{\sum\frac{n}{p_{0}}}{\sum\frac{n}{p_{t}}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Bilateral formulae==

=== Marshall-Edgeworth ===
The Marshall-Edgeworth index, credited to [[Alfred Marshall|Marshall]] (1887) and [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth|Edgeworth]] (1925),&lt;ref&gt;PPI manual, Chapter 15, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; is a weighted relative of current period to base period sets of prices. This index uses the arithmetic average of the current and based period quantities for weighting. It is considered a pseudo-superlative formula and is symmetric.&lt;ref&gt;PPI manual, 620.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the Marshall-Edgeworth index can be problematic in cases such as a comparison of the price level of a large country to a small one.  In such instances, the set of quantities of the large country will overwhelm those of the small one.&lt;ref&gt;PPI manual, Chapter 15, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_{ME}=\frac{\sum\left[p_{t}\cdot \frac{1}{2}\left(q_{0}+q_{t}\right)\right]}{\sum\left[p_{0}\cdot \frac{1}{2}(q_{0}+q_{t})\right]}=\frac{\sum\left[p_{t}\cdot\left(q_{0}+q_{t}\right)\right]}{\sum\left[p_{0}\cdot\left(q_{0}+q_{t}\right)\right]}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Superlative indices ===
Superlative indices treat prices and quantities equally across periods. They are symmetrical and provide close approximations of [[cost of living index|cost of living indices]] and other theoretical indices used to provide guidelines for constructing price indices.  All superlative indices produce similar results and are generally the favored formulas for calculating price indices.&lt;ref&gt;ILO CPI manual, Chapter 1, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  A superlative index is defined technically as "an index that is exact for a flexible functional form that can provide a [[order of approximation|second-order approximation]] to other twice-differentiable functions around the same point."&lt;ref&gt;Export and Import manual, Chapter 18, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fisher ====
The change in a Fisher index from one period to the next is the [[geometric mean]] of the changes in Laspeyres's and Paasche's indexes between those periods, and these are chained together to make comparisons over many periods:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{F}=\sqrt{P_{L}\cdot P_{P}}&lt;/math&gt;

This is also called Fisher's "ideal" price index.

==== Törnqvist ====
{{further|Törnqvist index}}
The Törnqvist or Törnqvist-Theil index is the geometric average of the n price relatives of the current to base period prices (for n goods) weighted by the arithmetic average of the value shares for the two periods.&lt;ref&gt;PPI manual, p. 610&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.stats.govt.nz/domino/external/omni/omni.nsf/wwwglsry/tornqvist+index+and+other+log-change+index+numbers "Tornqvist Index and other Log-change Index Numbers"], Statistics New Zealand Glossary of Common Terms.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P_{T}=\prod_{i=1}^{n}\left(\frac{p_{i,t}}{p_{i,0}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{p_{i,0}\cdot q_{i,0}}{\sum\left(p_{0}\cdot q_{0}\right)}+\frac{p_{i,t}\cdot q_{i,t}}{\sum\left(p_{t}\cdot q_{t}\right)}\right]}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Walsh ====
The Walsh price index is the weighted sum of the current period prices divided by the weighted sum of the base period prices with the geometric average of both period quantities serving as the weighting mechanism:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{W}=\frac{\sum\left(p_{t}\cdot\sqrt{q_{0}\cdot q_{t}}\right)}{\sum\left(p_{0}\cdot\sqrt{q_{0}\cdot q_{t}}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Pythagorean proof (1).svg|300px|right|thumb|An example of "beauty in method"—a simple and elegant proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]].]]

'''Mathematical beauty''' describes the notion that some [[mathematician]]s may derive [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] pleasure from their work, and from [[mathematics]] in general. They express this pleasure by describing mathematics (or, at least, some aspect of mathematics) as ''beautiful''. Mathematicians describe mathematics as an [[art]] form or, at a minimum, as a [[creativity|creative activity]]. Comparisons are often made with [[music]] and [[poetry]].

[[Bertrand Russell]] expressed his sense of mathematical beauty in these words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|authorlink=Bertrand Russell|title=Mysticism and Logic: And Other Essays|publisher=[[Longman]]|year=1919|page=60|chapter=The Study of Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zwMQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=Mathematics+rightly+viewed+possesses+not+only+truth+but+supreme+beauty+a+beauty+cold+and+austere+like+that+of+sculpture+without+appeal+to+any+part+of+our+weaker+nature+without+the+gorgeous+trappings+inauthor:Russell|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Paul Erdős]] expressed his views on the [[ineffability]] of mathematics when he said, "Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] beautiful. If you don't see why, someone can't tell you. I ''know'' numbers are beautiful. If they aren't beautiful, nothing is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Devlin|first=Keith|title=The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved And Why Numbers Are Like Gossip|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|year=2000|page=140|chapter=Do Mathematicians Have Different Brains?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJdmfYEaLG4C|accessdate=2008-08-22|isbn=978-0-465-01619-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beauty in method==
Mathematicians describe an especially pleasing method of [[Mathematical proof|proof]] as ''[[Elegance|elegant]]''. Depending on context, this may mean:

* A proof that uses a minimum of additional assumptions or previous results.
* A proof that is unusually succinct.
* A proof that derives a result in a surprising way (e.g., from an apparently unrelated [[theorem]] or collection of theorems).
* A proof that is based on new and original insights.
* A method of proof that can be easily generalized to solve a family of similar problems.

In the search for an elegant proof, mathematicians often look for different independent ways to prove a result—the first proof that is found may not be the best. The theorem for which the greatest number of different proofs have been discovered is possibly the [[Pythagorean theorem]], with hundreds of proofs having been published.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elisha Scott Loomis]] published over 360 proofs in his book Pythagorean Proposition ({{isbn|0-873-53036-5}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Another theorem that has been proved in many different ways is the theorem of [[quadratic reciprocity]]—[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] alone published eight different proofs of this theorem.

Conversely, results that are logically correct but involve laborious calculations, over-elaborate methods, very conventional approaches, or that rely on a large number of particularly powerful [[axiom]]s or previous results are not usually considered to be elegant, and may be called ''ugly'' or ''clumsy''.

==Beauty in results==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Fermat's last theorem]] --&gt;
[[File:EulerIdentity2.svg|thumb|right|Starting at ''e''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, travelling at the velocity ''i'' relative to one's position for the length of time π, and adding 1, one arrives at 0. (The diagram is an [[Argand diagram]])]]
Some mathematicians{{sfnp|Rota|1997|p=173}} see beauty in mathematical results that establish connections between two areas of mathematics that at first sight appear to be unrelated. These results are often described as ''deep''.

While it is difficult to find universal agreement on whether a result is deep, some examples are often cited. One is [[Euler's identity]]:&lt;ref name=Gallagher2014&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=James|title=Mathematics: Why the brain sees maths as beauty|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26151062|accessdate=13 February 2014|newspaper=BBC News online|date=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math display=block&gt;\displaystyle e^{i \pi} +1 = 0\, .&lt;/math&gt;

This is a special case of [[Euler's formula]], which the physicist [[Richard Feynman]] called "our jewel" and "the most remarkable formula in mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard P.|last= Feynman|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics |volume=I|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1977|isbn=0-201-02010-6|pages=22–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern examples include the [[modularity theorem]], which establishes an important connection between [[elliptic curve]]s and [[modular form]]s (work on which led to the awarding of the [[Wolf Prize]] to [[Andrew Wiles]] and [[Robert Langlands]]), and "[[monstrous moonshine]]", which connects the [[Monster group]] to [[modular function]]s via [[string theory]] for which [[Richard Borcherds]] was awarded the [[Fields Medal]].

Other examples of deep results include unexpected insights into mathematical structures. For example, Gauss's [[Theorema Egregium]] is a deep theorem which relates a local phenomenon ([[curvature]]) to a global phenomenon ([[area]]) in a surprising way. In particular, the area of a triangle on a curved surface is proportional to the excess of the triangle and the proportionality is curvature. Another example is the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] (and its vector versions including [[Green's theorem]] and [[Stokes' theorem]]).

The opposite of ''deep'' is ''trivial''. A trivial theorem may be a result that can be derived in an obvious and straightforward way from other known results, or which applies only to a specific set of particular objects such as the [[empty set]]. Sometimes, however, a statement of a theorem can be original enough to be considered deep, even though its proof is fairly obvious.

In his ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'', [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]] suggests that a beautiful proof or result possesses "inevitability", "unexpectedness", and "economy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A Mathematician's Apology|author=Hardy, G.H. | chapter = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gian-Carlo Rota|Rota]], however, disagrees with unexpectedness as a sufficient condition for beauty and proposes a counterexample:
{{quote|A great many theorems of mathematics, when first published, appear to be surprising; thus for example some twenty years ago [from 1977] the proof of the existence of [[Exotic sphere|non-equivalent differentiable structures]] on spheres of high dimension was thought to be surprising, but it did not occur to anyone to call such a fact beautiful, then or now.{{sfnp|Rota|1997|p=172}} }}
Perhaps ironically, Monastyrsky writes:
{{quote|It is very difficult to find an analogous invention in the past to [[Milnor]]'s beautiful construction of the different differential structures on the seven-dimensional sphere... The original proof of Milnor was not very constructive, but later E. Briscorn showed that these differential structures can be described in an extremely explicit and beautiful form.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last = Monastyrsky|title=Some Trends in Modern Mathematics and the Fields Medal|year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This disagreement illustrates both the subjective nature of mathematical beauty and its connection with mathematical results: in this case, not only the existence of exotic spheres, but also a particular realization of them.

==Beauty in experience==
[[File:Compound of five cubes.png|thumb|222px|A "cold and austere beauty" has been attributed to the [[compound of five cubes]]]]
{{tone|section|date=March 2013}}
Interest in [[pure mathematics]] separate from [[Empirical research|empirical]] study has been part of the experience [[History of mathematics|of various civilizations]], including that of the [[Greek mathematics|ancient Greeks]], who "did mathematics for the beauty of it".&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetic pleasure that [[mathematical physicist]]s tend to experience in Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]] has been attributed (by [[Paul Dirac]], among others) to its "great mathematical beauty".&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; The beauty of mathematics is experienced when the [[reality|physical reality]] of objects are represented by [[mathematical models]]. [[Group theory]], developed in the early 1800s for the sole purpose of solving [[polynomial]] equations, became a fruitful way of categorizing [[elementary particle]]s—the building blocks of matter. Similarly, the study of [[knot theory|knots]] provides important insights into [[string theory]] and [[loop quantum gravity]].

Some believe that in order to appreciate mathematics, one must engage in doing mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=George|title=Mathematics Is Not a Spectator Sport|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|year=2005|chapter=Preface|isbn=0-387-25528-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=psFwdN6V6icC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;dq=there+is+nothing+in+the+world+of+mathematics+that+corresponds+to+an+audience+in+a+concert+hall,+where+the+passive+listen+to+the+active.+Happily,+mathematicians+are+all+doers,+not+spectators.|accessdate=2008-08-22|quote="...there is nothing in the world of mathematics that corresponds to an audience in a concert hall, where the passive listen to the active. Happily, mathematicians are all ''doers'', not spectators.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are some teachers that encourage [[student engagement]] by teaching mathematics in a kinesthetic way (see [[kinesthetic learning]]). For example, [[Math Circle]] is an afterschool enrichment program where students do mathematics through games and activities; in a general Math Circle lesson, students use pattern finding, observation, and exploration to make their own mathematical discoveries. For example, mathematical beauty arises in a Math Circle activity on [[symmetry]] designed for 2nd and 3rd graders. In this activity, students create their own snowflakes by folding a square piece of paper and cutting out designs of their choice along the edges of the folded paper. When the paper is unfolded, a symmetrical design reveals itself. In a day to day elementary school mathematics class, symmetry can be presented as such in an artistic manner where students see aesthetically pleasing results in mathematics.

Some teachers prefer to use [[mathematical manipulatives]] to present mathematics in an aesthetically pleasing way. Examples of a manipulative include [[algebra tiles]], [[cuisenaire rods]], and [[pattern blocks]]. For example, one can teach the method of [[completing the square]] by using algebra tiles. Cuisenaire rods can be used to teach fractions, and pattern blocks can be used to teach geometry. Using mathematical manipulatives helps students gain a conceptual understanding that might not be seen immediately in written mathematical formulas.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, E. (1989). Effects of Manipulative Materials in Mathematics Instruction. Journal for Research in Mathematics Education, 20, 498–505.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another example involves [[origami]]. Origami, the art of paper folding, has aesthetic qualities and many mathematical connections. One can study the [[mathematics of paper folding]] by observing the [[crease pattern]] on unfolded origami pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Hull, Thomas. "Project Origami: Activities for Exploring Mathematics". Taylor &amp; Francis, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Combinatorics]] (the study of counting) has artistic representations that some find mathematically beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;Brualdi, Richard. "Introductory Combinatorics." Pearson, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many visual examples that illustrate combinatorial concepts. Here are some topics and objects seen in combinatorics courses with visual representations:
* [[Four color theorem]]
* [[Young tableau]]
* [[Permutohedron]]
* [[Graph theory]]
* [[Partition of a set]]

==Beauty and philosophy==
Some mathematicians are of the opinion that the doing of mathematics is closer to discovery than invention, for example:
{{quote|There is no scientific discoverer, no poet, no painter, no musician, who will not tell you that he found ready made his discovery or poem or picture – that it came to him from outside, and that he did not consciously create it from within.
|[[William Kingdon Clifford]], from a lecture to the Royal Institution titled "Some of the conditions of mental development"}}
These mathematicians believe that the detailed and precise results of mathematics may be reasonably taken to be true without any dependence on the universe in which we live. For example, they would argue that the theory of the [[natural numbers]] is fundamentally valid, in a way that does not require any specific context. Some mathematicians have extrapolated this viewpoint that mathematical beauty is truth further, in some cases becoming [[mysticism]].

[[Pythagoras#Mathematics|Pythagorean mathematicians]] believed in the literal reality of numbers. The discovery of the existence of [[irrational number]]s was a shock to them, since they considered the existence of numbers not expressible as the ratio of two natural numbers to be a flaw in nature (the Pythagorean [[world view]] did not contemplate the [[Limit of a sequence|limits of infinite sequences]] of ratios of natural numbers—the modern notion of a [[real number]]). From a modern perspective, their mystical approach to numbers may be viewed as [[numerology]].

In [[Plato]]'s philosophy there were two worlds, the physical one in which we live and another abstract world which contained unchanging truth, including mathematics. He believed that the physical world was a mere reflection of the more perfect abstract world.

[[Hungary|Hungarian]] mathematician [[Paul Erdős]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Schechter, Bruce | title=My brain is open: The mathematical journeys of Paul Erdős | publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | location=New York | year=2000 | pages=70–71 | isbn = 0-684-85980-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; spoke of an imaginary book, in which God has written down all the most beautiful mathematical proofs. When Erdős wanted to express particular appreciation of a proof, he would exclaim "This one's from The Book!"

Twentieth-century French philosopher [[Alain Badiou]] claims that [[ontology]] is mathematics. Badiou also believes in deep connections between mathematics, poetry and philosophy.

In some cases, natural philosophers and other scientists who have made extensive use of mathematics have made leaps of inference between beauty and physical truth in ways that turned out to be erroneous. For example, at one stage in his life, [[Johannes Kepler]] believed that the proportions of the orbits of the then-known planets in the [[Solar System]] have been arranged by [[God]] to correspond to a concentric arrangement of the five [[Platonic solid]]s, each orbit lying on the [[Circumscribed sphere|circumsphere]] of one [[polyhedron]] and the [[Inscribed sphere|insphere]] of another. As there are exactly five Platonic solids, Kepler's hypothesis could only accommodate six planetary orbits and was disproved by the subsequent discovery of [[Uranus]].

==Beauty and mathematical information theory==
In the 1970s, [[Abraham Moles]] and [[Frieder Nake]] analyzed links between beauty, [[information processing]], and [[information theory]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Moles: ''Théorie de l'information et perception esthétique'', Paris, Denoël, 1973 ([[Information Theory]] and aesthetical perception)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F Nake (1974). Ästhetik als Informationsverarbeitung. ([[Aesthetics]] as information processing). Grundlagen und Anwendungen der Informatik im Bereich ästhetischer Produktion und Kritik. Springer, 1974, {{isbn|3-211-81216-4}}, {{isbn|978-3-211-81216-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] formulated a mathematical theory of observer-dependent subjective beauty based on [[algorithmic information theory]]: the most beautiful objects among subjectively comparable objects have short [[algorithmic information theory|algorithmic]] descriptions (i.e., [[Kolmogorov complexity]]) relative to what the observer already knows.&lt;ref&gt;J. Schmidhuber. [[Low-complexity art]]. [[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]], Journal of the International Society for the Arts, Sciences, and Technology ([[Leonardo, The International Society of the Arts, Sciences and Technology|Leonardo/ISAST]]), 30(2):97–103, 1997. {{doi|10.2307/1576418}}. {{JSTOR|1576418}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Schmidhuber. Papers on the theory of beauty and [[low-complexity art]] since 1994: http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/beauty.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Schmidhuber. Simple Algorithmic Principles of Discovery, Subjective Beauty, Selective Attention, Curiosity &amp; Creativity. Proc. 10th Intl. Conf. on Discovery Science (DS 2007) pp. 26–38, LNAI 4755, Springer, 2007. Also in Proc. 18th Intl. Conf. on Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT 2007) p. 32, LNAI 4754, Springer, 2007. Joint invited lecture for DS 2007 and ALT 2007, Sendai, Japan, 2007. {{arXiv|0709.0674}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Schmidhuber explicitly distinguishes between beautiful and interesting. The latter corresponds to the [[first derivative]] of subjectively perceived beauty:
the observer continually tries to improve the [[predictability]] and [[Data compression|compressibility]] of the observations by discovering regularities such as repetitions and [[symmetries]] and [[fractal]] [[self-similarity]]. Whenever the observer's learning process (possibly a predictive artificial [[neural network]]) leads to improved data compression such that the observation sequence can be described by fewer [[bit]]s than before, the temporary interestingness of the data corresponds to the compression progress, and is proportional to the observer's internal curiosity reward.&lt;ref&gt;.J.

===Music===
Examples of the use of mathematics in music include the [[stochastic music]] of [[Iannis Xenakis]], [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci]] in [[Tool (band)|Tool]]'s [[Lateralus (song)|Lateralus]], counterpoint of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[polyrhythm]]ic structures (as in [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]''), the [[Metric modulation]] of [[Elliott Carter]], [[permutation]] theory in [[serialism]] beginning with [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and application of Shepard tones in [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]'s ''[[Hymnen]]''.

===Visual arts===

{{Refimprove|date=May 2008}} 
A '''mathematical model''' is a description of a [[system]] using [[mathematics|mathematical]] concepts and [[Language of mathematics|language]]. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed '''mathematical modeling'''. Mathematical models are used in the [[natural science]]s (such as [[physics]], [[biology]], [[earth science]], [[chemistry]]) and [[engineering]] disciplines (such as [[computer science]], [[electrical engineering]]), as well      as in the [[social sciences]] (such as [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]]). 

A model may help to explain a system and to study the effects of different components, and to make predictions about behaviour.

== Elements of a mathematical model ==

Mathematical models can take many forms, including [[dynamical systems]], [[statistical model]]s, [[differential equations]], or [[Game theory|game theoretic models]].  These and other types of models can overlap, with a given  model involving a variety of abstract structures. In general, mathematical models may include [[model theory|logical models]].  In many cases, the quality of a scientific field depends on how well the mathematical models developed on the theoretical side agree with results of repeatable experiments.  Lack of agreement between theoretical mathematical models and experimental measurements often leads to important advances as better theories are developed.

In the [[physical sciences]], a traditional mathematical model contains most of the following elements:
# [[Governing equation|Governing equations]]
# Supplementary sub-models
## [[Defining equation (physics)|Defining equations]]
## [[Constitutive equation|Constitutive equations]]
# Assumptions and constraints
## [[Initial condition|Initial]] and [[Boundary condition|boundary conditions]]
## [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|Classical constraints]] and [[Kinematics|kinematic equations]]

== Classifications ==
Mathematical models are usually composed of relationships and ''[[variable (mathematics)|variables]]''. Relationships can be described by ''[[Operator (mathematics)|operators]]'', such as algebraic operators, functions, differential operators, etc. Variables are abstractions of system [[parameter (computer programming)|parameters]] of interest, that can be [[Quantification (science)|quantified]]. Several classification criteria can be used for mathematical models according to their structure:
* '''Linear vs. nonlinear:''' If all the operators in a mathematical model exhibit [[linear]]ity, the resulting mathematical model is defined as linear. A model is considered to be nonlinear otherwise. The definition of linearity and nonlinearity is dependent on context, and linear models may have nonlinear expressions in them.  For example, in a [[Linear model|statistical linear model]], it is assumed that a relationship is linear in the parameters, but it may be nonlinear in the predictor variables.  Similarly, a differential equation is said to be linear if it can be written with linear [[differential operator]]s, but it can still have nonlinear expressions in it.  In a [[Optimization (mathematics)|mathematical programming]] model, if the objective functions and constraints are represented entirely by [[linear equation]]s, then the model is regarded as a linear model.  If one or more of the objective functions or constraints are represented with a [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] equation, then the model is known as a nonlinear model.&lt;br&gt;Nonlinearity, even in fairly simple systems, is often associated with phenomena such as [[Chaos theory|chaos]] and [[irreversibility]].  Although there are exceptions, nonlinear systems and models tend to be more difficult to study than linear ones.  A common approach to nonlinear problems is [[linearization]], but this can be problematic if one is trying to study aspects such as irreversibility, which are strongly tied to nonlinearity.
* '''Static vs. dynamic:''' A ''dynamic'' model  accounts for time-dependent changes in the state of the system, while a ''static'' (or steady-state) model calculates the system in equilibrium, and thus is time-invariant.  Dynamic models typically are represented by [[differential equation]]s or [[difference equation]]s.
* '''Explicit vs. implicit:''' If all of the input parameters of the overall model are known, and the output parameters can be calculated by a finite series of computations, the model is said to be ''explicit''. But sometimes it is the ''output'' parameters which are known, and the corresponding inputs must be solved for by an iterative procedure, such as [[Newton's method]] (if the model is linear) or [[Broyden's method]] (if non-linear). In such a case the model is said to be ''implicit''. For example, a [[jet engine]]'s physical properties such as turbine and nozzle throat areas can be explicitly calculated given a design [[thermodynamic cycle]] (air and fuel flow rates, pressures, and temperatures) at a specific flight condition and power setting, but the engine's operating cycles at other flight conditions and power settings cannot be explicitly calculated from the constant physical properties.
* '''Discrete vs. continuous:''' A [[discrete modeling|discrete model]] treats objects as discrete, such as the particles in a [[molecular model]] or the states in a [[statistical model]]; while a [[continuous model]] represents the objects in a continuous manner, such as the velocity field of fluid in pipe flows, temperatures and stresses in a solid, and electric field that applies continuously over the entire model due to a point charge.
* '''Deterministic vs. probabilistic (stochastic):''' A [[deterministic system|deterministic]] model is one in which every set of variable states is uniquely determined by parameters in the model and by sets of previous states of these variables; therefore, a deterministic model always performs the same way for a given set of initial conditions. Conversely, in a stochastic model—usually called a "[[statistical model]]"—randomness is present, and variable states are not described by unique values, but rather by [[probability]] distributions.
* '''Deductive, inductive, or floating:''' A deductive model is a logical structure based on a theory. An inductive model arises from empirical findings and generalization from them. The floating model rests on neither theory nor observation, but is merely the invocation of expected structure. Application of mathematics in social sciences outside of economics has been criticized for unfounded models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Stanislav Andreski |first=Stanislav |last=Andreski |year=1972 |title=Social Sciences as Sorcery |publisher=[[St. Martin’s Press]] |isbn=0-14-021816-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Application of [[catastrophe theory]] in science has been characterized as a floating model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Clifford Truesdell |first=Clifford |last=Truesdell |year=1984 |title=An Idiot’s Fugitive Essays on Science |pages=121–7 |publisher=Springer |isbn=3-540-90703-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance in the natural sciences ==
Mathematical models are of great importance in the natural sciences, particularly in [[physics]]. Physical [[theory|theories]] are almost invariably expressed using mathematical models.

Throughout history, more and more accurate mathematical models have been developed. [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's laws]] accurately describe many everyday phenomena, but at certain limits [[relativity theory]] and [[quantum mechanics]] must be used; even these do not apply to all situations and need further refinement{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{Examples|date=September 2017}}. It is possible to obtain the less accurate models in appropriate limits, for example relativistic mechanics reduces to Newtonian mechanics at speeds much less than the [[speed of light]]. Quantum mechanics reduces to classical physics when the quantum numbers are high. For example, the [[de Broglie wavelength]] of a tennis ball is insignificantly small, so classical physics is a good approximation to use in this case.

It is common to use idealized models in physics to simplify things. Massless ropes, point particles, [[ideal gases]] and the [[particle in a box]] are among the many simplified models used in physics. The laws of physics are represented with simple equations such as Newton's laws, [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Schrödinger equation]]. These laws are such as a basis for making mathematical models of real situations. Many real situations are very complex and thus modeled approximate on a computer, a model that is computationally feasible to compute is made from the basic laws or from approximate models made from the basic laws. For example, molecules can be modeled by [[molecular orbital]] models that are approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation. In [[engineering]], physics models are often made by mathematical methods such as [[finite element analysis]].

Different mathematical models use different geometries that are not necessarily accurate descriptions of the geometry of the universe. [[Euclidean geometry]] is much used in classical physics, while [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]] are examples of theories that use [[geometry|geometries]] which are not Euclidean.

== Some applications==&lt;!--whatever this section is, it isn't background (original heading), and isn't general--&gt;
Since [[prehistory|prehistorical times]] simple models such as [[map]]s and [[Mathematical diagram|diagrams]] have been used.

Often when engineers analyze a system to be controlled or optimized, they use a mathematical model. In analysis, engineers can build a descriptive model of the system as a hypothesis of how the system could work, or try to estimate how an unforeseeable event could affect the system. Similarly, in control of a system, engineers can try out different control approaches in [[simulation]]s.

A mathematical model usually describes a system by a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of variables and a set of equations that establish relationships between the variables. Variables may be of many types; [[Real number|real]] or [[integer]] numbers, [[Boolean data type|boolean]] values or [[String (computing)|strings]], for example. The variables represent some properties of the system, for example, measured system outputs often in the form of [[Signal (electronics)|signals]], [[Chronometry|timing data]], counters, and event occurrence (yes/no). The actual model is the set of functions that describe the relations between the different variables.

== Building blocks ==
In [[business]] and [[engineering]], mathematical models may be used to maximize a certain output. The system under consideration will require certain inputs. The system relating inputs to outputs depends on other variables too: [[decision theory|decision variables]], [[state variable]]s, [[Exogeny|exogenous]] variables, and [[random variable]]s.

Decision variables are sometimes known as independent variables.  Exogenous variables are sometimes known as [[parameter]]s or [[constant (mathematics)|constant]]s.
The variables are not independent of each other as the state variables are dependent on the decision, input, random, and exogenous variables.  Furthermore, the output variables are dependent on the state of the system (represented by the state variables).

[[Goal|Objective]]s and [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s of the system and its users can be represented as [[function (mathematics)|function]]s of the output variables or state variables.  The [[objective function]]s will depend on the perspective of the model's user.  Depending on the context, an objective function is also known as an ''index of performance'', as it is some measure of interest to the user.  Although there is no limit to the number of objective functions and constraints a model can have, using or optimizing the model becomes more involved (computationally) as the number increases.

For example, [[economist]]s often apply [[linear algebra]] when using [[input-output model]]s. Complicated mathematical models that have many variables may be consolidated by use of [[vector space|vectors]] where one symbol represents several variables.

== A priori information ==
[[File:Blackbox3D-withGraphs.png|thumb|480px|To analyse something with a typical "black box approach", only  the behavior of the stimulus/response will be accounted for, to infer the (unknown) ''box''. The usual representation of this ''black box system''  is a [[data flow diagram]] centered in the box.]]

Mathematical modeling problems are often classified into [[black box]] or [[White box (software engineering)|white box]] models, according to how much [[a priori (philosophy)|a priori]] information on the system is available. A black-box model is a system of which there is no a priori information available. A white-box model (also called glass box or clear box) is a system where all necessary information is available. Practically all systems are somewhere between the black-box and white-box models, so this concept is useful only as an intuitive guide for deciding which approach to take.

Usually it is preferable to use as much a priori information as possible to make the model more accurate. Therefore, the white-box models are usually considered easier, because if you have used the information correctly, then the model will behave correctly. Often the a priori information comes in forms of knowing the type of functions relating different variables. For example, if we make a model of how a medicine works in a human system, we know that usually the amount of medicine in the blood is an [[exponential decay|exponentially decaying]] function. But we are still left with several unknown parameters; how rapidly does the medicine amount decay, and what is the initial amount of medicine in blood? This example is therefore not a completely white-box model. These parameters have to be estimated through some means before one can use the model.

In black-box models one tries to estimate both the functional form of relations between variables and the numerical parameters in those functions. Using a priori information we could end up, for example, with a set of functions that probably could describe the system adequately. If there is no a priori information we would try to use functions as general as possible to cover all different models. An often used approach for black-box models are [[artificial neural network|neural networks]] which usually do not make assumptions about incoming data. Alternatively the NARMAX (Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average model with eXogenous inputs) algorithms which were developed as part of [[nonlinear system identification]] &lt;ref name="SAB1"&gt;Billings S.A. (2013), ''Nonlinear System Identification: NARMAX Methods in the Time, Frequency, and Spatio-Temporal Domains'', Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to select the model terms, determine the model structure, and estimate the unknown parameters in the presence of correlated and nonlinear noise. The advantage of NARMAX models compared to neural networks is that NARMAX produces models that can be written down and related to the underlying process, whereas neural networks produce an approximation that is opaque.

=== Subjective information ===
Sometimes it is useful to incorporate subjective information into a mathematical model.  This can be done based on [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], [[experience]], or [[expert opinion]], or based on convenience of mathematical form.  [[Bayesian statistics]] provides a theoretical framework for incorporating such subjectivity into a rigorous analysis: we specify a [[prior probability distribution]] (which can be subjective), and then update this distribution based on empirical data.

An example of when such approach would be necessary is a situation in which an experimenter bends a coin slightly and tosses it once, recording whether it comes up heads, and is then given the task of predicting the probability that the next flip comes up heads.  After bending the coin, the true probability that the coin will come up heads is unknown; so the experimenter would need to make a decision (perhaps by looking at the shape of the coin) about what prior distribution to use.  Incorporation of such subjective information might be important to get an accurate estimate of the probability.

== Complexity ==
In general, model complexity involves a trade-off between simplicity and accuracy of the model.  [[Occam's razor]] is a principle particularly relevant to modeling, its essential idea being that among models with roughly equal predictive power, the simplest one is the most desirable.  While added complexity usually improves the realism of a model, it can make the model difficult to understand and analyze, and can also pose computational problems, including [[numerical instability]].  [[Thomas Kuhn]] argues that as science progresses, explanations tend to become more complex before a [[paradigm shift]] offers radical simplification {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

For example, when modeling the flight of an aircraft, we could embed each mechanical part of the aircraft into our model and would thus acquire an almost white-box model of the system. However, the computational cost of adding such a huge amount of detail would effectively inhibit the usage of such a model. Additionally, the uncertainty would increase due to an overly complex system, because each separate part induces some amount of variance into the model. It is therefore usually appropriate to make some approximations to reduce the model to a sensible size. Engineers often can accept some approximations in order to get a more robust and simple model. For example, [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[classical mechanics]] is an approximated model of the real world. Still, Newton's model is quite sufficient for most ordinary-life situations, that is, as long as particle speeds are well below the [[speed of light]], and we study macro-particles only.

== Training and tuning ==
Any model which is not pure white-box contains some [[parameter]]s that can be used to fit the model to the system it is intended to describe. If the modeling is done by an [[artificial neural network]] or other [[machine learning]], the optimization of parameters is called ''training''{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{Why|date=September 2017}}, while the optimization of model hyperparameters is called ''tuning'' and often uses [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. In more conventional modeling through explicitly given mathematical functions, parameters are often determined by ''[[curve fitting]]''{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

== Model evaluation ==
A crucial part of the modeling process is the evaluation of whether or not a given mathematical model describes a system accurately.  This question can be difficult to answer as it involves several different types of evaluation.

=== Fit to empirical data ===
Usually the easiest part of model evaluation is checking whether a model fits experimental measurements or other empirical data.  In models with parameters, a common approach to test this fit is to split the data into two disjoint subsets: training data and verification data. The training data are used to estimate the model parameters.  An accurate model will closely match the verification data even though these data were not used to set the model's parameters. This practice is referred to as [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] in statistics.

Defining a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] to measure distances between observed and predicted data is a useful tool of assessing model fit.  In statistics, decision theory, and some [[economic model]]s, a [[loss function]] plays a similar role.

While it is rather straightforward to test the appropriateness of parameters, it can be more difficult to test the validity of the general mathematical form of a model.  In general, more mathematical tools have been developed to test the fit of [[statistical model]]s than models involving [[differential equations]].  Tools from [[non-parametric statistics]] can sometimes be used to evaluate how well the data fit a known distribution or to come up with a general model that makes only minimal assumptions about the model's mathematical form.

=== Scope of the model ===
Assessing the scope of a model, that is, determining what situations the model is applicable to, can be less straightforward.  If the model was constructed based on a set of data, one must determine for which systems or situations the known data is a "typical" set of data.

The question of whether the model describes well the properties of the system between data points is called [[interpolation]], and the same question for events or data points outside the observed data is called [[extrapolation]].

As an example of the typical limitations of the scope of a model, in evaluating Newtonian [[classical mechanics]], we can note that Newton made his measurements without advanced equipment, so he could not measure properties of particles travelling at speeds close to the speed of light.  Likewise, he did not measure the movements of molecules and other small particles, but macro particles only. It is then not surprising that his model does not extrapolate well into these domains, even though his model is quite sufficient for ordinary life physics.

=== Philosophical considerations ===
Many types of modeling implicitly involve claims about [[causality]].  This is usually (but not always) true of models involving differential equations.  As the purpose of modeling is to increase our understanding of the world, the validity of a model rests not only on its fit to empirical observations, but also on its ability to extrapolate to situations or data beyond those originally described in the model. One can think of this as the differentiation between qualitative and quantitative predictions. One can also argue that a model is worthless unless it provides some insight which goes beyond what is already known from direct investigation of the phenomenon being studied.

An example of such criticism is the argument that the mathematical models of [[optimal foraging theory]] do not offer insight that goes beyond the common-sense conclusions of [[evolution]] and other basic principles of ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pyke | first1 = G. H. | doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.002515 | title = Optimal Foraging Theory: A Critical Review | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 15 | pages = 523–575 | year = 1984 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
* One of the popular examples in [[computer science]] is the mathematical models of various machines, an example is the [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA) which is defined as an abstract mathematical concept, but due to the deterministic nature of a DFA, it is implementable in hardware and software for solving various specific problems. For example, the following is a DFA M with a binary alphabet, which requires that the input contains an even number of 0s.

[[File:DFAexample.svg|right|thumb|250px|The [[state diagram]] for ''M'']]
''M'' = (''Q'', Σ, δ, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F'') where
*''Q'' = {''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;},
*Σ = {0, 1},
*''q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,
*''F'' = {''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}, and
*δ is defined by the following [[state transition table]]:
:{| border="1" cell padding="1" cell spacing="0"
| || &lt;center&gt;'''0'''&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;'''1'''&lt;/center&gt;
|-
|'''''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|'''''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

The state ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; represents that there has been an even number of 0s in the input so far, while ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; signifies an odd number. A 1 in the input does not change the state of the automaton. When the input ends, the state will show whether the input contained an even number of 0s or not. If the input did contain an even number of 0s, ''M'' will finish in state ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, an accepting state, so the input string will be accepted.

The language recognized by ''M'' is the [[regular language]] given by the [[regular expression]] 1*( 0 (1*) 0 (1*) )*, where "*" is the [[Kleene star]], e.g., 1* denotes any non-negative number (possibly zero) of symbols "1".

* Many everyday activities carried out without a thought are uses of mathematical models. A geographical [[map projection]] of a region of the earth onto a small, plane surface  is a model&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landinfo.com/resources_dictionaryMP.htm landinfo.com, definition of map projection]&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used for many purposes such as planning travel.
* Another simple activity is predicting the position of a vehicle from its initial position, direction and speed of travel, using the equation that distance traveled is the product of time and speed. This is known as [[dead reckoning]] when used more formally. Mathematical modeling in this way does not necessarily require formal mathematics; animals have been shown to use dead reckoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gallistel |first= |title=The Organization of Learning |location=Cambridge |publisher=The MIT Press |year=1990 |ISBN=0-262-07113-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Whishaw | first1 = I.

* ''[[Population]] Growth''. A simple (though approximate) model of population growth is the [[Malthusian growth model]]. A slightly more realistic and largely used population growth model is the [[logistic function]], and its extensions. 
* ''Model of a particle  in a potential-field''. In this model we consider a particle as being a point of mass which describes a trajectory in space which is modeled by a function giving its coordinates in space as a function of time. The potential field is given by a function &lt;math&gt;V\!:\mathbb{R}^3\!\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and the trajectory, that is a function &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}\!:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, is the solution of the [[differential equation]]:

::&lt;math&gt; -\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2}m=\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial x}\mathbf{\hat{x}}+\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial y}\mathbf{\hat{y}}+\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial z}\mathbf{\hat{z}}, &lt;/math&gt;

that can be written also as:

::&lt;math&gt; m\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2}=-\nabla V[\mathbf{r}(t)]. &lt;/math&gt;

:Note this model assumes  the particle is a point mass, which is certainly known to be false in many cases in which we use this model; for example, as a model of planetary motion.

* ''Model of rational behavior for a consumer''.  In this model we assume a consumer faces a choice of ''n'' commodities labeled 1,2,...,''n'' each with a market price ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. The consumer is assumed to have an [[ordinal utility]] function ''U'' (ordinal in the sense that only the sign of the differences between two utilities, and not the level of each utility, is meaningful), depending on the amounts of commodities ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; consumed.  The model further assumes that the consumer has a budget ''M'' which is used to purchase a vector ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in such a way as to maximize ''U''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).  The problem of rational behavior in this model then becomes an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problem, that is:
:: &lt;math&gt; \max U(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n) &lt;/math&gt;
:: subject to:
:: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n p_i x_i \leq M.&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; x_{i} \geq 0   \; \; \; \forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n \} &lt;/math&gt;
: This model has been used in a wide variety of economic contexts, such as in [[general equilibrium theory]] to show existence and [[Pareto efficiency]] of economic equilibria.

A '''mathematical theory''' is a subfield of mathematics that is an area of mathematical research. A theory can be a [[body of knowledge]], and so in this sense a "mathematical theory" refers to an area of mathematical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esotericka.org/cmc/tth.html | title=Theorems and Theories | first=Sam | last=Nelson | website=www.esotericka.org | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819090102/http://www.esotericka.org/cmc/tth.html | archivedate=2014-08-19 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Mark C. | last=Chu-Carroll | date=March 13, 2007 | url=http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/03/13/theories-theorems-lemmas-and-c-1/Theories | title=Theorems, Lemmas, and Corollaries | work=Good Math, Bad Math blog }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is distinct from the idea of [[mathematical model]]s.

'''Mathematics and art''' are related in a variety of ways. [[Mathematics]] has itself been described as an [[art]] [[mathematical beauty|motivated by beauty]]. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as [[Music and mathematics|music]], [[dance]], [[painting]], [[Mathematics and architecture|architecture]], [[sculpture]], and [[Mathematics and fiber arts|textiles]]. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.

Mathematics and art have a long historical relationship. [[List of mathematical artists|Artists have used mathematics]] since the 4th century BC when the Greek [[sculpture|sculptor]] [[Polykleitos]] wrote his ''Canon'', prescribing proportions based on the ratio 1:{{radic|2}} for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the [[golden ratio]] in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian [[Renaissance]], [[Luca Pacioli]] wrote the influential treatise ''[[De Divina Proportione]]'' (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, [[Piero della Francesca]], developed [[Euclid]]'s ideas on [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] in treatises such as ''De Prospectiva Pingendi'', and in his paintings. The engraver [[Albrecht Dürer]] made many references to mathematics in his work ''[[Melencolia I]]''. In modern times, the [[graphic artist]] [[M. C. Escher]] made intensive use of [[tessellation]] and [[hyperbolic geometry]], with the help of the mathematician [[H. S. M. Coxeter]], while the [[De Stijl]] movement led by [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as [[quilting]], [[knitting]], [[cross-stitch]], [[crochet]], [[embroidery]], [[weaving]], [[Turkish carpet|Turkish]] and other [[carpet]]-making, as well as [[kilim]]. In [[Islamic art]], symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian [[girih]] and Moroccan [[zellige]] tilework, [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]] [[jali]] pierced stone screens, and widespread [[muqarnas]] vaulting.

Mathematics has directly influenced art with conceptual tools such as [[linear perspective]], the analysis of [[symmetry]], and mathematical objects such as [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] and the [[Möbius strip]]. [[Magnus Wenninger]] creates colourful [[stellation|stellated polyhedra]], originally as models for teaching. Mathematical concepts such as [[recursion]] and logical paradox can be seen in paintings by [[Rene Magritte]] and in engravings by M. C. Escher. [[Computer art]] often makes use of [[fractal]]s including the [[Mandelbrot set]], and sometimes explores other mathematical objects such as [[cellular automata]]. Controversially, the artist [[David Hockney]] has argued that artists from the Renaissance onwards made use of the [[camera lucida]] to draw precise representations of scenes; the architect Philip Steadman similarly argued that [[Vermeer]] used the [[camera obscura]] in his distinctively observed paintings.

Other relationships include the algorithmic analysis of artworks by [[X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy]], the finding that traditional [[batik]]s from different regions of [[Java]] have distinct [[fractal dimension]]s, and stimuli to mathematics research, especially [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s theory of perspective, which eventually led to [[Girard Desargues]]'s [[projective geometry]]. A persistent view, based ultimately on the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] notion of harmony in music, holds that everything was arranged by Number, that God is the geometer of the world, and that therefore the world's [[sacred geometry|geometry is sacred]], as seen in artworks such as [[William Blake]]'s ''[[The Ancient of Days]]''.

==Origins: from Ancient Greece to the Renaissance==

{{Anchor|Polykleitos}}

===Polykleitos's ''Canon'' and ''symmetria''===
[[File:Doryphoros MAN Napoli Inv6011-2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Roman copy in marble of ''[[Doryphoros]]'', originally a bronze by [[Polykleitos]]]]
{{further information|Polykleitos}}

[[Polykleitos]] the elder (c.450–420 BC) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[sculptor]] from the school of [[Argos]], and a contemporary of [[Phidias]]. His works and statues consisted mainly of bronze and were of athletes. According to the philosopher and mathematician [[Xenocrates]], Polykleitos is ranked as one of the most important sculptors of [[Classical antiquity]] for his work on the ''[[Doryphorus]]'' and the statue of [[Hera]] in the [[Heraion of Argos]].&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stewart |first1=Andrew |title=Polykleitos of Argos," One Hundred Greek Sculptors: Their Careers and Extant Works |journal=[[Journal of Hellenic Studies]] |date=November 1978 |volume=98 |pages=122–131 |doi=10.2307/630196|jstor=630196}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his sculptures may not be as famous as those of Phidias, they are much admired. In the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos, a treatise he wrote designed to document the "perfect" [[anatomy|anatomical]] proportions of the male nude, Polykleitos gives us a mathematical approach towards sculpturing the human body.&lt;ref name=Stewart/&gt;

Polykleitos uses the [[distal phalanges|distal phalanx]] of the [[little finger]] as the basic module for determining the proportions of the human body.&lt;ref name=Tobin&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tobin, Richard |title=The ''Canon'' of Polykleitos |journal=[[American Journal of Archaeology]] |volume=79 |issue=4 |date=October 1975 |pages=307–321 |doi=10.2307/503064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polykleitos multiplies the length of the distal phalanx by the [[square root of two]] ({{radic|2}}) to get the distance of the [[intermediate phalanges|second phalanges]] and multiplies the length again by {{radic|2}} to get the length of the [[proximal phalanges|third phalanges]]. Next, he takes the [[finger]] length and multiplies that by {{radic|2}} to get the length of the palm from the base of the finger to the [[ulna]]. This [[geometric series]] of measurements progresses until Polykleitos has formed the arm, chest, body, and so on.&lt;ref name=Lawton&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lawton |first1=Arthur J. |title=Pattern, Tradition and Innovation in Vernacular Architecture |journal=Past |date=2013 |volume=36 |url=http://www.pioneeramerica.org/past2013/past2013artlawton.html |quote=The base figure is a square the length and width of the distal phalange of the little finger. Its diagonals rotated to one side transform the square to a 1 : {{radic|2}} root rectangle. In Figure 5 this rectangular figure marks the width and length of the adjacent medial phalange. Rotating the medial diagonal proportions the proximal phalange and similarly from there to the wrist, from wrist to elbow and from elbow to shoulder top. Each new step advances the diagonal's pivot point.|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos is immense in [[Classical Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], and [[Renaissance]] sculpture, many sculptors following Polykleitos's prescription. While none of Polykleitos's original works survive, Roman copies demonstrate his ideal of physical perfection and mathematical precision. Some scholars argue that [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] thought influenced the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos.&lt;ref name=Raven&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Raven |first1=J. E. |title=Polyclitus and Pythagoreanism |journal=[[Classical Quarterly]] |date=1951 |volume=1|issue=3–4 |pages=147– |doi=10.1017/s0009838800004122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Canon'' applies the basic mathematical concepts of Greek geometry, such as the ratio, proportion, and ''symmetria'' (Greek for "harmonious proportions") and turns it into a system capable of describing the human form through a series of continuous [[geometric series|geometric progressions]].&lt;ref name=Tobin/&gt;

===Perspective and proportion===
{{main article|Perspective (graphical)}}

[[File:Brunelleschi's perspective experiment.jpg|thumb|[[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]'s experiment with [[linear perspective]]]]

In classical times, rather than making distant figures smaller with [[linear perspective]], painters sized objects and figures according to their thematic importance. In the Middle Ages, some artists used [[reverse perspective]] for special emphasis. The Muslim mathematician [[Alhazen]] (Ibn al-Haytham) described a theory of optics in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' in 1021, but never applied it to art.&lt;ref name=StAndrews/&gt; The [[Renaissance]] saw a rebirth of [[Classical Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] culture and ideas, among them the study of mathematics to understand [[nature]] and the [[arts]]. Two major motives drove artists in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance towards mathematics. First, painters needed to figure out how to depict three-dimensional scenes on a two-dimensional canvas. Second, philosophers and artists alike were convinced that mathematics was the true essence of the physical world and that the entire universe, including the arts, could be explained in geometric terms.&lt;ref name=Emmer&gt;{{cite book |editor=Emmer, Michelle |title=The Visual Mind II |publisher=MIT Press |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-262-05048-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rudiments of perspective arrived with [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] (1266/7 – 1337), who attempted to draw in perspective using an algebraic method to determine the placement of distant lines. In 1415, the Italian [[architect]] [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and his friend [[Leon Battista Alberti]] demonstrated the geometrical method of applying perspective in Florence, using [[similar triangles]] as formulated by Euclid, to find the apparent height of distant objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vasari, Giorgio |authorlink=Giorgio Vasari |date=1550 |title=[[Lives of the Artists]] |publisher=Torrentino |page=Chapter on Brunelleschi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alberti |first1=Leon Battista |last2=Spencer |first2=John R. |title=On Painting |date=1956 |publisher=Yale University Press |origyear=1435|url=http://www.noteaccess.com/Texts/Alberti/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunelleschi's own perspective paintings are lost, but [[Masaccio]]'s painting of the Holy Trinity shows his principles at work.&lt;ref name=StAndrews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Field |first1=J.

The painter [[Piero della Francesca]] (c.1415–1492) exemplified this new shift in Italian Renaissance thinking. He was an expert [[mathematician]] and [[geometer]], writing books on [[solid geometry]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], including ''[[De Prospectiva Pingendi]] (On Perspective for Painting)'', ''Trattato d'Abaco (Abacus Treatise)'', and ''De corporibus regularibus (On Regular Solids)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=della Francesca, Piero |title=De Prospectiva Pingendi |editor=G.

Milanesi |date=1878 |page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piero's interest in perspective can be seen in his paintings including the [[Polyptych of Perugia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zuffi |first=Stefano  |title=Piero della Francesca |publisher=L'Unità – Mondadori Arte |year=1991 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''San Agostino altarpiece'' and ''[[The Flagellation of Christ]]''. His work on geometry influenced later mathematicians and artists including [[Luca Pacioli]] in his ''De Divina Proportione'' and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Piero studied classical mathematics and the works of [[Archimedes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Heath, T.L. |title=The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1908 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was taught commercial arithmetic in "abacus schools"; his writings are formatted like abacus school textbooks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Grendler, P. |title=What Piero Learned in School: Fifteenth-Century Vernacular Education |work=Piero della Francesca and His Legacy |editor=M.A. Lavin |publisher=University Press of New England |year=1995 |pages=161–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps including Leonardo Pisano ([[Fibonacci]])'s 1202 ''[[Liber Abaci]]''. [[Linear perspective]] was just being introduced into the artistic world. Alberti explained in his 1435 ''[[De pictura]]'': "light rays travel in straight lines from points in the observed scene to the eye, forming a kind of [[pyramid]] with the eye as vertex." A painting constructed with linear perspective is a [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] of that pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alberti, Leon Battista |title=On Painting |editor= Kemp, Martin |author2=Grayson, Cecil (trans.) |publisher=Penguin Classics |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''De Prospectiva Pingendi'', Piero transforms his empirical observations of the way aspects of a figure change with point of view into mathematical proofs. His treatise starts in the vein of Euclid: he defines the point as "the tiniest thing that is possible for the eye to comprehend".{{efn|In Piero's Italian: "una cosa tanto picholina quanto e possible ad ochio comprendere".}}&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt; He uses [[deductive logic]] to lead the reader to the perspective representation of a three-dimensional body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Peterson, Mark |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/mac/Italian/geometry.shtml |title=The Geometry of Piero della Francesca |quote=In Book I, after some elementary constructions to introduce the idea of the apparent size of an object being actually its angle subtended at the eye, and referring to Euclid's Elements Books I and VI, and Euclid's Optics, he turns, in Proposition 13, to the representation of a square lying flat on the ground in front of the viewer. What should the artist actually draw? After this, objects are constructed in the square (tilings, for example, to represent a tiled floor), and corresponding objects are constructed in perspective; in Book II prisms are erected over these planar objects, to represent houses, columns, etc.; but the basis of the method is the original square, from which everything else follows.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[David Hockney]] [[Hockney-Falco thesis|argued]] in his book ''[[Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters]]'' that artists started using a [[camera lucida]] from the 1420s, resulting in a sudden change in precision and realism, and that this practice was continued by major artists including [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], [[Jan van Eyck|Van Eyck]], and [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hockney |first=David |title=Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters |year=2006 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-28638-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics disagree on whether Hockney was correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Van Riper |first1=Frank |title=Hockney's 'Lucid' Bomb At the Art Establishment |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/photo/essays/vanRiper/030220.htm |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marr |first1=Andrew |title=What the eye didn't see |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/oct/07/featuresreview.review1 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=7 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the architect Philip Steadman argued controversially&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Janson |first1=Jonathan |title=An Interview with Philip Steadman |url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/interviews_newsletter/steadman_interview.html#.VeqxKJdUWHg |publisher=Essential Vermeer |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=25 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Vermeer]] had used a different device, the [[camera obscura]], to help him create his distinctively observed paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steadman |first1=Philip |title=Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth Behind the Masterpieces |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-280302-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1509, [[Luca Pacioli]] (c. 1447–1517) published ''[[De divina proportione]]'' on [[mathematical]] and [[artistic]] [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]], including in the human face. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) illustrated the text with woodcuts of regular solids while he studied under Pacioli in the 1490s. Leonardo's drawings are probably the first illustrations of skeletonic solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/pacioli.html |title=Luca Pacioli's Polyhedra |author=Hart, George |authorlink=George W.

As early as the 15th century, [[curvilinear perspective]] found its way into paintings by artists interested in image distortions. [[Jan van Eyck]]'s 1434 ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' contains a convex mirror with reflections of the people in the scene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Criminisi, A. |author2=Kempz, M. |author3=Kang, S.

Three-dimensional space can be represented convincingly in art, as in [[technical drawing]], by means other than perspective. [[Oblique projection]]s, including cavalier perspective (used by French military artists to depict fortifications in the 18th century), were used continuously and ubiquitously by Chinese artists from the first or second centuries until the 18th century. The Chinese acquired the technique from India, which acquired it from Ancient Rome. Oblique projection is seen in Japanese art, such as in the [[Ukiyo-e]] paintings of [[Torii Kiyonaga]] (1752–1815).&lt;ref name=Cucker269&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=269–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

an irrational number which is approximately 1.325.

Many traditional rugs, whether pile carpets or flatweave [[kilim]]s, are divided into a central field and a framing border; both can have symmetries, though in handwoven carpets these are often slightly broken by small details, variations of pattern and shifts in colour introduced by the weaver.&lt;ref name=Cucker89&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=89–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; In kilims from [[Anatolia]], the [[motif (textile arts)|motifs]] used are themselves usually symmetrical. The general layout, too, is usually present, with arrangements such as stripes, stripes alternating with rows of motifs, and packed arrays of roughly hexagonal motifs. The field is commonly laid out as a wallpaper with a [[wallpaper group]] such as pmm, while the border may be laid out as a frieze of [[frieze group]] pm11, pmm2 or pma2. Turkish and Central Asian kilims often have three or more borders in different frieze groups. Weavers certainly had the intention of symmetry, without explicit knowledge of its mathematics.&lt;ref name=Cucker89/&gt;
The mathematician and architectural theorist [[Nikos Salingaros]] suggests that the "powerful presence"&lt;ref name=Salingaros/&gt; (aesthetic effect) of a "great carpet"&lt;ref name=Salingaros/&gt; such as the best Konya two-medallion carpets of the 17th century is created by mathematical techniques related to the theories of the architect [[Christopher Alexander]]. These techniques include making opposites couple; opposing colour values; differentiating areas geometrically, whether by using complementary shapes or balancing the directionality of sharp angles; providing small-scale complexity (from the knot level upwards) and both small- and large-scale symmetry; repeating elements at a hierarchy of different scales (with a ratio of about 2.7 from each level to the next). Salingaros argues that "all successful carpets satisfy at least nine of the above ten rules", and suggests that it might be possible to create a metric from these rules.&lt;ref name=Salingaros&gt;{{cite journal |author=Salingaros, Nikos |title=The 'life' of a carpet: an application of the Alexander rules |url=http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/~yxk833/life.carpet.html |journal=8th International Conference on Oriental Carpets |location=Philadelphia |date=November 1996}} Reprinted in {{cite book |editor1-last=Eiland |editor1-first=M. |editor2-last=Pinner |editor2-first=M. |title=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies V |date=1998 |publisher=Conference on Oriental Carpets |location=Danville, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic art]] [[Islamic geometric patterns|exploits symmetries]] in many of its artforms, notably in [[girih tiles|girih]] tilings. These are formed using a set of five tile shapes, namely a regular decagon, an elongated hexagon, a bow tie, a rhombus, and a regular pentagon. All the sides of these tiles have the same length; and all their angles are multiples of 36° (π/5 [[radian]]s), offering fivefold and tenfold symmetries. The tiles are decorated with [[strapwork]] lines (girih), generally more visible than the tile boundaries. In 2007, the physicists [[Peter Lu]] and [[Paul Steinhardt]]  argued that girih resembled [[quasicrystalline]] [[Penrose tiling]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lu, Peter J. |author2=Steinhardt, Paul J. |year=2007 |title=Decagonal and Quasi-crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=315 |pages=1106–1110 |doi=10.1126/science.1135491 |pmid=17322056 |issue=5815 |bibcode=2007Sci...315.1106L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborate geometric [[zellige]] tilework is a distinctive element in [[Morocco|Moroccan]] architecture.&lt;ref name=Castera&gt;{{cite book |last1=Castera |first1=Jean Marc |last2=Peuriot |first2=Francoise |title=Arabesques.

===Polyhedra===
[[File:Leonardo polyhedra.png|thumb|The first printed illustration of a [[rhombicuboctahedron]], by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], published in ''[[De Divina Proportione]]'', 1509]]

The [[Platonic solid]]s and other [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] are a recurring theme in Western art. They are found, for instance, in a marble mosaic featuring the [[small stellated dodecahedron]], attributed to Paolo Uccello, in the floor of the [[San Marco di Venezia|San Marco Basilica]] in Venice;&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; in Leonardo da Vinci's diagrams of regular polyhedra drawn as illustrations for [[Luca Pacioli]]'s 1509 book ''The Divine Proportion'';&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; as a glass [[rhombicuboctahedron]] in Jacopo de Barbari's portrait of Pacioli, painted in 1495;&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; in the truncated polyhedron (and various other mathematical objects) in [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s engraving [[Melencolia I]];&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; and in [[Salvador Dalí]]'s painting ''The Last Supper'' in which Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant [[dodecahedron]].

[[Albrecht Dürer]] (1471–1528) was a [[German people|German]] [[Renaissance]] [[printmaker]] who made important contributions to polyhedral literature in his 1525 book, ''Underweysung der Messung (Education on Measurement)'', meant to teach the subjects of [[linear perspective]], [[geometry]] in [[architecture]], [[Platonic solids]], and [[regular polygons]]. Dürer was likely influenced by the works of [[Luca Pacioli]] and [[Piero della Francesca]] during his trips to [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Panofsky, E. |title=The Life and Art of Albrecht Durer |publisher=Princeton |year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the examples of perspective in ''Underweysung der Messung'' are underdeveloped and contain inaccuracies, there is a detailed discussion of polyhedra. Dürer is also the first to introduce in text the idea of [[Net (polyhedron)|polyhedral nets]], polyhedra unfolded to lie flat for printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hart, George W. |url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/durer.html |title=Dürer's Polyhedra |accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dürer published another influential book on [[human proportions]] called ''Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion (Four Books on Human Proportion)'' in 1528.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dürer |first1=Albrecht |title=Hierinn sind begriffen vier Bucher von menschlicher Proportion|url=https://archive.org/details/hierinnsindbegri00dure |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=24 June 2015 |location=Nurenberg |date=1528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fractal dimensions===

[[File:Batik pedalaman - parang klithik.JPG|thumb|[[Batik]]s from [[Surakarta]], Java, like this ''parang klithik'' sword pattern, have a [[fractal dimension]] between 1.2 and 1.5.]]

Traditional Indonesian wax-resist [[batik]] designs on cloth combine [[representation (arts)|representational]] motifs (such as floral and vegetal elements) with abstract and somewhat chaotic elements, including imprecision in applying the wax resist, and random variation introduced by cracking of the wax. Batik designs have a [[fractal dimension]] between 1 and 2, varying in different regional styles. For example, the batik of [[Cirebon]] has a fractal dimension of 1.1; the batiks of [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Surakarta]] (Solo) in Central [[Java]] have a fractal dimension of 1.2 to 1.5; and the batiks of [[Rembang Regency|Lasem]] on the north coast of Java and of [[Tasikmalaya]] in West Java have a fractal dimension between 1.5 and 1.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lukman |first1=Muhamad |last2=Hariadi |first2=Yun |last3=Destiarmand |first3=Achmad Haldani |title=Batik Fractal : Traditional Art to Modern Complexity |journal=Proceeding Generative Art X, Milan, Italy |date=2007 |url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/36748400/32.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1474897246&amp;Signature=kXmu3pdTrpZ1pkw8CLV3GHNR%2FVs%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DBatik_Fractal_Traditional_Art_to_Modern.pdf |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[drip painting]] works of the modern artist [[Jackson Pollock]] are similarly distinctive in their fractal dimension. His 1948 ''Number 14'' has a coastline-like dimension of 1.45, while his later paintings had successively higher fractal dimensions and accordingly more elaborate patterns. One of his last works, ''Blue Poles'', took six months to create, and has the fractal dimension of 1.72.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ouellette |first1=Jennifer |title=Pollock's Fractals |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2001/nov/featpollock |accessdate=26 September 2016 |agency=Discover Magazine |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A complex relationship==
The astronomer [[Galileo Galilei]] in his ''[[Il Saggiatore]]'' wrote that "[The universe] is written in [[patterns in nature|the language of mathematics]], and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Galilei, Galileo |authorlink=Galileo Galilei |title=The Assayer |year=1623}}, as translated in {{cite book |author=Drake, Stillman |authorlink=Stillman Drake  |year=1957 |title=Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo |publisher=Doubleday |pages=237–238 |isbn=0-385-09239-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists who strive and seek to study nature must first, in Galileo's view, fully understand mathematics. Mathematicians, conversely, have sought to interpret and analyse art through the lens of geometry and rationality. The mathematician Felipe Cucker suggests that mathematics, and especially geometry, is a source of rules for "rule-driven artistic creation", though not the only one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the many strands of the resulting complex relationship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; are described below.

[[File:Ghhardy@72.jpg|thumb|upright|The mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]] defined a set of criteria for [[mathematical beauty]].]]

===Mathematics as an art===
{{main article|Mathematical beauty}}

The mathematician Jerry P. King describes mathematics as an art, stating that "the keys to mathematics are beauty and elegance and not dullness and technicality", and that beauty is the motivating force for mathematical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Jerry P. |title=The Art of Mathematics |date=1992 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |isbn=0-449-90835-6 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; King cites the mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]]'s 1940 essay ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]''. In it, Hardy discusses why he finds two theorems of [[classical antiquity|classical times]] as first rate, namely [[Euclid]]'s proof there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and the proof that the square root of 2 is [[irrational number|irrational]]. King evaluates this last against Hardy's criteria for [[mathematical beauty|mathematical elegance]]: "''seriousness, depth, generality, unexpectedness, inevitability'', and ''economy''" (King's italics), and describes the proof as "aesthetically pleasing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Jerry P. |title=The Art of Mathematics |date=1992 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |isbn=0-449-90835-6 |pages=135–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] agreed that mathematics possessed beauty but considered the reasons beyond explanation: "Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] beautiful. If you don't see why, someone can't tell you. I ''know'' numbers are beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Devlin |first=Keith |title=The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved And Why Numbers Are Like Gossip |publisher=Basic Books |year=2000 |page=140 |chapter=Do Mathematicians Have Different Brains? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJdmfYEaLG4C |isbn=978-0-465-01619-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[Richard Wright]] argues that mathematical objects that can be constructed can be seen either "as processes to simulate phenomena" or as works of "[[computer art]]". He considers the nature of mathematical thought, observing that [[fractals]] were known to mathematicians for a century before they were recognised as such. Wright concludes by stating that it is appropriate to subject mathematical objects to any methods used to "come to terms with cultural artifacts like art, the tension between objectivity and subjectivity, their metaphorical meanings and the character of representational systems." He gives as instances an image from the [[Mandelbrot set]], an image generated by a [[cellular automaton]] algorithm, and a [[rendering (computer graphics)|computer-rendered]] image, and discusses, with reference to the [[Turing test]], whether [[algorithm]]ic products can be art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=Richard |title=Some Issues in the Development of Computer Art as a Mathematical Art Form |journal=[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]] |date=1988 |volume=1 |issue=Electronic Art, supplemental issue |pages=103–110 |doi=10.2307/1557919 |jstor=1557919}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sasho Kalajdzievski's ''Math and Art: An Introduction to Visual Mathematics'' takes a similar approach, looking at suitably visual mathematics topics such as tilings, fractals and hyperbolic geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kalajdzievski |first1=Sasho |title=Math and Art: An Introduction to Visual Mathematics |date=2008 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |isbn=978-1-58488-913-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematician and [[theoretical physicist]] [[Henri Poincaré]]'s ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]'' was widely read by the [[Cubism|Cubists]], including [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Jean Metzinger]].&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, Arthur I. |title=Insights of Genius: Imagery and Creativity in Science and Art |publisher=Springer |year=2012 |isbn=1-4612-2388-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré viewed [[Euclidean geometry]] as just one of many possible geometric configurations, rather than as an absolute objective truth. The possible existence of a [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth dimension]] inspired artists to question classical [[Perspective (graphical)#Renaissance&amp;nbsp;: Mathematical basis|Renaissance perspective]]: [[non-Euclidean geometry]] became a valid alternative.&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;{{cite book |author=Henderson, Linda D. |title=The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean geometry in Modern Art |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://eres.lndproxy.org/edoc/AH317Antliff-09.pdf |author1=Antliff, Mark |author2=Leighten, Patricia Dee |title=Cubism and Culture |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |year=2001 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Everdell |first=William R. |authorlink=William Everdell |title=The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought |year=1997 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-22480-5 |page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept that painting could be expressed mathematically, in colour and form, contributed to Cubism, the art movement that led to [[abstract art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Green, Christopher |title=Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916–1928 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1987 |pages=13–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metzinger, in 1910, wrote that: "[Picasso] lays out a free, mobile perspective, from which that ingenious mathematician [[Maurice Princet]] has deduced a whole geometry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |date=October–November 1910 |title=Note sur la peinture |journal=Pan |page=60}} in {{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |publisher=Basic Books |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Metzinger wrote in his memoirs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Maurice Princet joined us often&amp;nbsp;... it was as an artist that he conceptualized mathematics, as an aesthetician that he invoked ''n''-dimensional continuums. He loved to get the artists interested in the [[Schlegel diagram|new views on space]] that had been opened up by [[Victor Schlegel|Schlegel]] and some others. He succeeded at that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |title=Le cubisme était né |year=1972 |publisher=Éditions Présence |pages=43–44}} in {{cite book |last=Ferry |first=Luc |authorlink=Luc Ferry |others=Robert De Loaiza, trans. |title=Homo Aestheticus: The Invention of Taste in the Democratic Age |year=1993 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-24459-8 |page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The impulse to make teaching or research models of mathematical forms naturally creates objects that have symmetries and surprising or pleasing shapes. Some of these have inspired artists such as the [[Dadaism|Dadaists]] [[Man Ray]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Man Ray–Human Equations A Journey from Mathematics to Shakespeare.

[[File:Objet mathematique by Man Ray.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Enneper surface]]s as [[Dadaism]]: [[Man Ray]]'s 1934 ''Objet mathematique'']]
Man Ray photographed some of the mathematical models in the [[Institut Henri Poincaré]] in Paris, including ''Objet mathematique'' (Mathematical object). He noted that this represented [[Enneper surface]]s with constant [[negative curvature]], derived from the [[pseudo-sphere]]. This mathematical foundation was important to him, as it allowed him to deny that the object was "abstract", instead claiming that it was as real as the urinal that Duchamp made into a work of art. Man Ray admitted that the object's [Enneper surface] formula "meant nothing to me, but the forms themselves were as varied and authentic as any in nature." He used his photographs of the mathematical models as figures in his series he did on [[Shakespeare]]'s plays, such as his 1934 painting ''Antony and Cleopatra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tubbs |first1=Robert |title=Mathematics in 20th-Century Literature and Art |date=2014 |publisher=Johns Hopkins |isbn=978-1-4214-1380-8 |pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art reporter Jonathan Keats, writing in ''ForbesLife'', argues that Man Ray photographed "the elliptic paraboloids and conic points in the same sensual light as his pictures of [[Kiki de Montparnasse]]", and "ingeniously repurposes the cool calculations of mathematics to reveal the topology of desire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Keats |first1=Jonathon |title=See How Man Ray Made Elliptic Paraboloids Erotic At This Phillips Collection Photography Exhibit |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathonkeats/2015/02/13/see-how-man-ray-made-elliptic-paraboloids-sexy-at-this-phillips-collection-photography-exhibit/ |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=10 September 2015 |date=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twentieth century sculptors such as [[Henry Moore]], [[Barbara Hepworth]] and [[Naum Gabo]] took inspiration from mathematical models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=311–312 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore wrote of his 1938 ''Stringed Mother and Child'': "Undoubtedly the source of my stringed figures was the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]]&amp;nbsp;...

The artists [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] founded the [[De Stijl]] movement, which they wanted to "establish a visual vocabulary {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} elementary geometrical forms comprehensible by all and adaptable to any discipline".&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/d/de-stijl |title=De Stijl |accessdate=11 September 2015 |work=Tate Glossary |publisher=The Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Curl |first=James Stevens |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=2006 |edition=Second |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of their artworks visibly consist of ruled squares and triangles, sometimes also with circles. De Stijl artists worked in painting, furniture, interior design and architecture.&lt;ref name=tate/&gt; After the breakup of De Stijl, Van Doesburg founded the [[Avant-garde]] [[Art Concret]] movement, describing his 1929–1930 ''[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Theo_van_Doesburg_218.jpg Arithmetic Composition]'', a series of four black squares on the diagonal of a squared background, as "a structure that can be controlled, a ''definite'' surface without chance elements or individual caprice", yet "not lacking in spirit, not lacking the universal and not&amp;nbsp;... empty as there is ''everything'' which fits the internal rhythm". The art critic Gladys Fabre observes that two progressions are at work in the painting, namely the growing black squares and the alternating backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tubbs, Robert |title=Mathematics in Twentieth-Century Literature and Art: Content, Form, Meaning  |year=2014 |publisher=JHU Press |pages=44–47 |isbn=978-1-4214-1402-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematics of [[tessellation]], polyhedra, shaping of space, and self-reference provided the graphic artist [[M. C. Escher]] (1898—1972) with a lifetime's worth of materials for his woodcuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/ggescher/ggescher-main1.html |title=Tour: M.C.

Escher used irregular polygons when tiling the plane and often used reflections, [[glide reflection]]s, and [[Translation (geometry)|translations]] to obtain further patterns. Many of his works contain impossible constructions, made using geometrical objects which set up a contradiction between perspective projection and three dimensions, but are pleasant to the human sight. Escher's ''[[Ascending and Descending]]'' is based on the "[[Penrose stairs|impossible staircase]]" created by the medical scientist [[Lionel Penrose]] and his son the mathematician [[Roger Penrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Penrose |first1=L.S. |last2=Penrose |first2=R. |title=Impossible objects: A special type of visual illusion |journal=[[British Journal of Psychology]] |year=1958 |volume=49 |pages=31–33 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1958.tb00634.x |pmid=13536303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kirousis |first1=Lefteris M. |last2=Papadimitriou |first2=Christos H. |author2-link=Christos Papadimitriou |title=The complexity of recognizing polyhedral scenes |doi=10.1109/sfcs.1985.59 |pages=175–185 |work=[[Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science|26th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science]] (FOCS 1985) |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=Martin |contribution=Tractability of Drawing Interpretation |doi=10.1007/978-1-84800-229-6_9 |isbn=978-1-84800-229-6 |pages=217–230 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |title=Line Drawing Interpretation |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Escher's many tessellation drawings were inspired by conversations with the mathematician [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] on [[hyperbolic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Roberts, Siobhan |authorlink=Siobhan Roberts|work=King of Infinite Space: Donald Coxeter, the Man Who Saved Geometry |page=Chapter 11 |title='Coxetering' with M.C. Escher |publisher=Walker |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escher was especially interested in five specific polyhedra, which appear many times in his work. The [[Platonic solids]]—tetrahedrons, cubes, octahedrons, dodecahedrons, and icosahedrons—are especially prominent in ''Order and Chaos'' and ''Four Regular Solids''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Escher, M.C. |title=The World of MC Escher |publisher=Random House |date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stellated figures often reside within another figure which further distorts the viewing angle and conformation of the polyhedrons and provides a multifaceted perspective artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Escher, M.C. |author2=Vermeulen, M.W. |author3=Ford, K. |title=Escher on Escher: Exploring the Infinite |year=1989 |publisher=HN Abrams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The visual intricacy of mathematical structures such as tessellations and polyhedra have inspired a variety of mathematical artworks. [[Stewart Coffin]] makes polyhedral puzzles in rare and beautiful woods; [[George W. Hart]] works on the theory of [[polyhedra]] and sculpts objects inspired by them; [[Magnus Wenninger]] makes "especially beautiful" models of [[List of Wenninger polyhedron models|complex stellated polyhedra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Malkevitch |first1=Joseph |title=Mathematics and Art. 5.

The distorted perspectives of [[anamorphosis]] have been explored in art since the sixteenth century, when [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] incorporated a severely distorted skull in his 1533 painting ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]''. Many artists since then, including Escher, have make use of anamorphic tricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marcolli, Matilde |authorlink=Matilde Marcolli |title=The notion of Space in Mathematics through the lens of Modern Art |publisher=Century Books |date=July 2016 |url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~matilde/SpaceMathArticle.pdf |pages=23–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematics of [[topology]] has inspired several artists in modern times. The sculptor [[John Robinson (sculptor)|John Robinson]] (1935–2007) created works such as ''Gordian Knot'' and ''Bands of Friendship'', displaying [[knot theory]] in polished bronze.&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt; Other works by Robinson explore the topology of [[torus]]es.

Modelling is far from the only possible way to illustrate mathematical concepts. Giotto's ''[[Stefaneschi Triptych]]'', 1320, illustrates [[recursion]] in the form of ''[[mise en abyme]]''; the central panel of the triptych contains, lower left, the kneeling figure of Cardinal Stefaneschi, holding up the triptych as an offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Giotto di Bondone and assistants: Stefaneschi triptych |url=http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/PIN/PIN_Sala02_03.html |publisher=The Vatican |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giorgio Chirico]]'s [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] paintings such as his 1917 ''Great Metaphysical Interior'' explore the question of levels of representation in art by depicting paintings within his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=337–338 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art can exemplify logical paradoxes, as in some paintings by the [[surrealist]] [[René Magritte]], which can be read as [[semiotic]] jokes about confusion between levels. In ''[[The Human Condition (painting)|La condition humaine]]'' (1933), Magritte depicts an easel (on the real canvas), seamlessly supporting a view through a window which is framed by "real" curtains in the painting. Similarly, Escher's ''[[Print Gallery (M. C. Escher)|Print Gallery]]'' (1956) is a print which depicts a distorted city which contains a gallery which [[recursive]]ly contains the picture, and so ''[[ad infinitum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cooper |first1=Jonathan |title=Art and Mathematics |url=http://www.doctordada.com/art/art-and-mathematics/ |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magritte made use of spheres and cuboids to distort reality in a different way, painting them alongside an assortment of houses in his 1931 ''Mental Arithmetic'' as if they were children's building blocks, but house-sized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hofstadter |first1=Douglas R. |authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter |title=Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid |titlelink=Gödel, Escher, Bach |date=1980 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-028920-6 |page=627}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' observed that the "eerie toytown image" prophesied [[Modernism]]'s usurpation of "cosy traditional forms", but also plays with the human tendency to seek [[patterns in nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hall |first1=James |title=René Magritte: The Pleasure Principle – exhibition |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jun/10/rene-magritte-pleasure-principle-exhibition |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salvador Dalí's last painting, ''[[The Swallow's Tail]]'' (1983), was part of a series inspired by [[René Thom]]'s [[catastrophe theory]].&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Elliott |editor1-last=Ades |editor1-first=Dawn |title=Dali |date=2004 |publisher=Bompiani Arte |location=Milan |pages=418–421}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish painter and sculptor [[Pablo Palazuelo]] (1916–2007) focused on the investigation of form. He developed a style that he described as the geometry of life and the geometry of all nature. Consisting of simple geometric shapes with detailed patterning and coloring, in works such as ''Angular I'' and ''Automnes'', Palazuelo expressed himself in geometric transformations.&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt;

Artists, however, do not necessarily take geometry literally. As [[Douglas Hofstadter]] writes in his 1980 reflection on human thought, ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', by way of (among other things) the mathematics of art: "The difference between an Escher drawing and [[non-Euclidean geometry]] is that in the latter, comprehensible interpretations can be found for the undefined terms, resulting in a comprehensible total system, whereas for the former, the end result is not reconcilable with one's conception of the world, no matter how long one stares at the pictures." Hofstadter discusses the seemingly [[paradox]]ical lithograph ''Print Gallery'' by M. C. Escher; it depicts a seaside town containing an art gallery which seems to contain a painting of the seaside town, there being a "strange loop, or tangled hierarchy" to the levels of reality in the image. The artist himself, Hofstadter observes, is not seen; his reality and his relation to the lithograph are not paradoxical.&lt;ref name=GEB&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hofstadter |first1=Douglas R. |authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter |title=Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid |titlelink=Gödel, Escher, Bach |date=1980 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-394-74502-2 |pages=98–99, 690–717}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image's central void has also attracted the interest of mathematicians Bart de Smit and [[Hendrik Lenstra]], who propose that it could contain a [[Droste effect]] copy of itself, rotated and shrunk; this would be a further illustration of recursion beyond that noted by Hofstadter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=de Smit |first=B. |title=The Mathematical Structure of Escher's Print Gallery |year=2003 |journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=446–451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LenstraWebsite&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lenstra |first1=Hendrik |last2=De Smit |first2=Bart |title=Applying mathematics to Escher's Print Gallery |url=http://escherdroste.math.leidenuniv.nl/index.php?menu=intro |publisher=Leiden University |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis of art history===

Algorithmic analysis of images of artworks, for example using [[X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy]], can reveal information about art. Such techniques can uncover images in layers of paint later covered over by an artist; help art historians to visualize an artwork before it cracked or faded; help to tell a copy from an original, or distinguish the brushstroke style of a master from those of his apprentices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stanek |first1=Becca |title=Van Gogh and the Algorithm: How Math Can Save Art |url=http://time.com/2884058/math-art-van-gogh-duke/ |publisher=Time Magazine |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sipics |first1=Michelle |title=The Van Gogh Project: Art Meets Mathematics in Ongoing International Study |url=https://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=1568 |publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is highly unlikely, therefore, that Pollock consciously understood the fractals he was painting. Nevertheless, his introduction of fractals was deliberate. For example, the colour of the anchor layer was chosen to produce the sharpest contrast against the canvas background and this layer also occupies more canvas space than the other layers, suggesting that Pollock wanted this highly fractal anchor layer to visually dominate the painting. Furthermore, after the paintings were completed, he would dock the canvas to remove regions near the canvas edge where the pattern density was less uniform. |doi=10.1088/2058-7058/12/10/21 |volume=12 |pages=25–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Max Ernst painted [[Lissajous figures]] directly by swinging a punctured bucket of paint over a canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0013/12307/WPIAAD_vol2_king.pdf |title=From Max Ernst to Ernst Mach: epistemology in art and science. |last=King |first=M. |date=2002 |accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The computer scientist [[Neil Dodgson]] investigated whether [[Bridget Riley]]'s stripe paintings could be characterised mathematically, concluding that while separation distance could "provide some characterisation" and global [[entropy]] worked on some paintings, [[autocorrelation]] failed as Riley's patterns were irregular. Local entropy worked best, and correlated well with the description given by the art critic Robert Kudielka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dodgson |first1=N. A. |title=Mathematical characterisation of Bridget Riley's stripe paintings |journal=[[Journal of Mathematics and the Arts]] |date=2012 |volume=5 |pages=1–21 |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nad10/pubs/jma12.pdf |quote=over the course [of] the early 1980s, Riley's patterns moved from more regular to more random (as characterised by global entropy), without losing their rhythmic structure (as characterised by local entropy). This reflects Kudielka's description of her artistic development. |doi=10.1080/17513472.2012.679468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American mathematician [[George Birkhoff]]'s 1933 ''Aesthetic Measure'' proposes a quantitative metric of the [[Aesthetics|aesthetic quality]] of an artwork. It does not attempt to measure the connotations of a work, such as what a painting might mean, but is limited to the "elements of order" of a polygonal figure. Birkhoff first combines (as a sum) five such elements: whether there is a vertical axis of symmetry; whether there is optical equilibrium; how many rotational symmetries it has; how wallpaper-like the figure is; and whether there are unsatisfactory features such as having two vertices too close together. This metric, ''O'', takes a value between −3 and 7. The second metric, ''C'', counts elements of the figure, which for a polygon is the number of different straight lines containing at least one of its sides. Birkhoff then defines his aesthetic measure of an object's beauty as ''O/C''. This can be interpreted as a balance between the pleasure looking at the object gives, and the amount of effort needed to take it in. Birkhoff's proposal has been criticized in various ways, not least for trying to put beauty in a formula, but he never claimed to have done that.&lt;ref name=Cucker116&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=116–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stimuli to mathematical research===

[[File:Fraser spiral.svg|thumb|upright|The [[Fraser spiral illusion]], named for Sir James Fraser who discovered it in 1908.]]

[[Optical illusion]]s such as the [[Fraser spiral illusion|Fraser spiral]] strikingly demonstrate limitations in human visual perception, creating what the [[art historian]] [[Ernst Gombrich]] called a "baffling trick." The black and white ropes that appear to form [[spiral]]s are in fact [[concentric circle]]s. The mid-twentieth century [[Op art|Op art or optical art]] style of painting and graphics exploited such effects to create the impression of movement and flashing or vibrating patterns seen in the work of artists such as [[Bridget Riley]]&lt;!--slight overlink seems sensible here--&gt;, Spyros Horemis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=163–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Vasarely]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=406–410 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacred geometry===
{{further information|Sacred geometry|Mathematics and music}}

A strand of art from Ancient Greece onwards sees God as the geometer of the world, and the world's geometry therefore as sacred. The belief that God created the universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins. [[Plutarch]] attributed the belief to [[Plato]], writing that "Plato said God geometrizes continually" (''Convivialium disputationum'', liber 8,2). This image has influenced Western thought ever since. The Platonic concept derived in its turn from a [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] notion of harmony in music, where the notes were spaced in perfect proportions, corresponding to the lengths of the lyre's strings; indeed, the Pythagoreans held that everything was arranged by Number. In the same way, in Platonic thought, the [[Platonic solid|regular or Platonic solids]] dictate the proportions found in nature, and in art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ghyka |first1=Matila |title=The Geometry of Art and Life |date=2003 |publisher=Dover |isbn=978-0-486-23542-4 |pages=ix–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lawlor |first1=Robert |title=Sacred Geometry: Philosophy and Practice |date=1982 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-81030-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Mediaeval manuscript illustration may refer to a verse in the Old Testament: "When he established the heavens I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the deep" (Proverbs 8:27), showing God drawing out the universe with a pair of compasses.&lt;ref name=Calter&gt;{{cite web |last1=Calter |first1=Paul |title=Celestial Themes in Art &amp; Architecture |url=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit10/unit10.html |publisher=Dartmouth College |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1596, the mathematical astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] modelled the universe as a set of nested Platonic solids, determining the relative sizes of the orbits of the planets.&lt;ref name=Calter/&gt; [[William Blake]]'s ''Ancient of Days'' and his painting of the physicist [[Isaac Newton]], naked and drawing with a compass, attempt to depict the contrast between the mathematically perfect spiritual world and the imperfect physical world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Thought of a Thought – Edgar Allan Poe |url=http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath522/kmath522.htm |publisher=MathPages |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in a different way does [[Salvador Dalí]]'s 1954 ''[[Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)]]'', which depicts the cross as a [[hypercube]], representing the divine perspective with four dimensions rather than the usual three.&lt;ref name=CorpusHypercubus /&gt; In Dali's ''[[The Sacrament of the Last Supper]]'' (1955) Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant [[dodecahedron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Livio |first1=Mario |authorlink=Mario Livio |title=The golden ratio and aesthetics |url=https://plus.maths.org/content/golden-ratio-and-aesthetics |accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas from '''[[Mathematics]]''' have been used as inspiration for '''[[fiber art]]s''' including [[quilt]] [[quilting|making]], [[knitting]], [[cross-stitch]], [[crochet]], [[embroidery]] and [[weaving]]. A wide range of mathematical concepts have been used as inspiration including [[topology]], [[graph theory]], [[number theory]] and [[algebra]]. Some techniques such as [[counted-thread embroidery]] are naturally [[geometry|geometrical]]; other kinds of [[textile]] provide a ready means for the colorful [[mathematics and art|physical expression of mathematical concepts]].

==Quilting==
{{main|quilt}}

The [[IEEE Spectrum]] has organized a number of competitions on [[quilt block]] design, and several books have been published on the subject. Notable quiltmakers include Diana Venters and Elaine Ellison, who have written a book on the subject ''Mathematical Quilts: No Sewing Required''. Examples of mathematical ideas used in the book as the basis of a quilt include the [[golden rectangle]], [[conic section]]s, [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s Claw, the [[Koch curve]], the [[Clifford torus]], [[San Gaku]], [[Lorenzo Mascheroni|Mascheroni]]'s [[cardioid]], [[Pythagorean triple]]s, [[spidron]]s, and the six [[trigonometric functions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Ellison | first1=Elaine | last2=Venters | first2=Diana | isbn=1-55953-317-X | publisher=Key Curriculum | title=Mathematical Quilts: No Sewing Required | year=1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knitting and crochet==
[[Image:Cross stitch embroidery.jpg|thumb|[[Cross-stitch]] [[counted-thread embroidery]]]]

Knitted mathematical objects include the [[Platonic solid]]s, [[Klein bottle]]s and [[Boy's surface]].
The [[Lorenz attractor|Lorenz manifold]] and the [[Hyperbolic manifold|hyperbolic plane]] have been crafted using crochet.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Henderson | first1 = David | last2 = Taimina | first2 = Daina | author2-link = Daina Taimina | doi = 10.1007/BF03026623 | issue = 2 | journal = [[Mathematical Intelligencer]]

==Embroidery==

[[File:Florentin.png|thumb|upright|Two [[Bargello (needlework)|Bargello patterns]]]]

Embroidery techniques such as [[counted-thread embroidery]]&lt;ref&gt;Gillow, John, and Bryan Sentance. ''World Textiles'', Little, Brown, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[cross-stitch]] and some [[canvas work]] methods such as [[Bargello (needlework)]] make use of the natural [[pixel]]s of the weave, lending themselves to geometric designs.&lt;ref&gt;Snook, Barbara. ''Florentine Embroidery''. Scribner, Second edition 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Elsa S. ''Bargello: Florentine Canvas Work''. Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weaving==

[[Ada Dietz]] (1882 &amp;ndash; 1950) was an American [[weaving|weaver]] best known for her 1949 monograph ''Algebraic Expressions in Handwoven Textiles'', which defines weaving patterns based on the expansion of multivariate [[polynomial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Dietz | first = Ada K. | location = Louisville, Kentucky

==Spinning==

[[Margaret Greig]] was a mathematician who articulated the mathematics of [[worsted spinning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=International Women in Science |author=Catharine M. C. Haines |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2001 |isbn=9781576070901 |page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion design==

The silk scarves from DMCK Designs' 2013 collection are all based on Douglas McKenna's [[space-filling curve]] patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Space-Filling Curves|url=https://dmck.us/the-company/space-filling-curves/|publisher=DMCK|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designs are either generalized Peano curves, or based on a new space-filling construction technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=McKenna, Douglas |title=The 7 Curve, Carpets, Quilts, and Other Asymmetric, Square-Filling, Threaded Tile Designs |work=Bridges Donostia: Mathematics, Music, Art, Architecture, Culture |url=http://www.bridgesmathart.org/2007/2007-program.html |publisher=The Bridges Organization | date=24 July 2007 |accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McKenna |first1=Douglas |title=Designing Symmetric Peano Curve Tiling Patterns with Escher-esque Foreground/Background Ambiguity |work=Bridges Leeuwarden: Mathematics, Music, Art, Architecture, Culture |url=http://www.bridgesmathart.org/2008/Schedule_V9-1.pdf |publisher=The Bridges Organization |accessdate=15 May 2015|date=28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Issey Miyake]] Fall-Winter 2010–2011 ready-to-wear collection featured designs from a collaboration between fashion designer Dai Fujiwara and mathematician [[William Thurston]]. The designs were inspired by Thurston's [[geometrization conjecture]], the statement that every [[3-manifold]] can be decomposed into pieces with one of eight different uniform geometries, a proof of which had been sketched in 2003 by [[Grigori Perelman]] as part of his proof of the [[Poincaré conjecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | last = Barchfield | first = Jenny | date = March 5, 2010 | publisher = [[ABC News]] | title = Fashion and Advanced Mathematics Meet at Miyake | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=10017982}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Educational research}}{{Merge from|Computer-based mathematics education|date=February 2018}}
In contemporary [[education]], '''mathematics education''' is the practice of [[teaching]] and [[learning]] [[mathematics]], along with the associated scholarly [[research]].

Researchers in mathematics education are primarily concerned with the tools, methods and approaches that facilitate practice or the study of practice; however, [[List of mathematics education journals|mathematics education research]], known on the continent of Europe as the [[didactics]] or [[pedagogy]] of mathematics, has developed into an extensive field of study, with its own concepts, theories, methods, national and international organisations, conferences and literature. This article describes some of the history, influences and recent controversies.

==History==
Elementary mathematics was part of the [[Education|education system]] in most ancient civilisations, including [[Ancient Greece]], the [[Roman Empire]], [[Vedic civilization|Vedic society]] and [[ancient Egypt]]. In most cases, a formal education was only available to [[male]] children with a sufficiently high status, wealth or [[caste]].
[[File:Woman teaching geometry.jpg|left|thumb|Illustration at the beginning of a 14th-century translation of Euclid's ''Elements''.]]

In [[Plato]]'s division of the [[liberal arts]] into the [[trivium (education)|trivium]] and the [[quadrivium]], the quadrivium included the mathematical fields of [[arithmetic]] and [[geometry]]. This structure was continued in the structure of [[Medieval university|classical education]] that was developed in medieval Europe. Teaching of geometry was almost universally based on [[Euclid]]'s ''Elements''. Apprentices to trades such as masons, merchants and money-lenders could expect to learn such practical mathematics as was relevant to their profession.

In the [[Renaissance]], the academic status of mathematics declined, because it was strongly associated with trade and commerce, and considered somewhat un-Christian.&lt;ref name="taboo"&gt;{{ cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=486172977 |title=Why We Learn Math Lessons That Date Back 500 Years |date=23 Jul 2016 |author=Gabrielle Emanuel |publisher=[[National Public Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it continued to be taught in European universities, it was seen as subservient to the study of [[Natural Philosophy|Natural]], [[Metaphysics|Metaphysical]] and [[Moral philosophy|Moral]] Philosophy.  The first modern arithmetic curriculum (starting with addition, then subtraction, multiplication, and division) arose at [[reckoning school]]s in Italy in the 1300s.&lt;ref name="taboo2"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/07/23/486172977/a-history-lesson-when-math-was-taboo Why We Learn Math Lessons That Date Back 500 Years]&lt;/ref&gt;  Spreading along trade routes, these methods were designed to be used in commerce. They contrasted with Platonic math taught at universities, which was more philosophical and concerned numbers as concepts rather than calculating methods.&lt;ref name="taboo2" /&gt;  They also contrasted with mathematical methods learned by [[artisan]] apprentices, which were specific to the tasks and tools at hand. For example, the division of a board into thirds can be accomplished with a piece of string, instead of measuring the length and using the arithmetic operation of division.&lt;ref name="taboo" /&gt;

The first mathematics textbooks to be written in English and French were published by [[Robert Recorde]], beginning with ''The Grounde of Artes'' in 1540. However, there are many different writings on mathematics and mathematics methodology that date back to 1800 BCE.  These were mostly located in Mesopotamia where the Sumerians were practicing multiplication and division.  There are also artifacts demonstrating their own methodology for solving equations like the quadratic equation.  After the Sumerians some of the most famous ancient works on mathematics come from Egypt in the form of the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] and the [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]].  The more famous [[Rhind Papyrus]] has been dated to approximately 1650 BCE but it is thought to be a copy of an even older scroll.  This papyrus was essentially an early textbook for Egyptian students.

The social status of mathematical study was improving by the seventeenth century, with the [[University of Aberdeen]] creating a Mathematics Chair in 1613, followed by the Chair in Geometry being set up in [[University of Oxford]] in 1619 and the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics|Lucasian Chair of Mathematics]] being established by the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1662. However, it was uncommon for mathematics to be taught outside of the universities.{{fact|date=April 2018}} [[Isaac Newton]], for example, received no formal mathematics teaching until he joined [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1661.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the [[Industrial Revolution]] led to an enormous increase in [[urban area|urban]] populations. Basic numeracy skills, such as the ability to tell the time, count money and carry out simple [[arithmetic]], became essential in this new urban lifestyle. Within the new [[public education]] systems, mathematics became a central part of the curriculum from an early age.

By the twentieth century, mathematics was part of the core curriculum in all [[developed country|developed countries]].

During the twentieth century, mathematics education was established as an independent field of research. Here are some of the main events in this development:

* In 1893, a Chair in mathematics education was created at the University of Göttingen, under the administration of [[Felix Klein]]
* The [[International Commission on Mathematical Instruction]] (ICMI) was founded in 1908, and Felix Klein became the first president of the organisation
* The professional [[periodical literature]] on mathematics education in the U.S.A. had generated more than 4000 articles after 1920, so in 1941 William L. Schaaf published a [[subject indexing|classified index]], sorting them into their various subjects.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Schaaf (1941) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b417103;view=1up;seq=11 A Bibliography of Mathematical Education], Forest Hills, N.Y. : Stevinus Press, link from [[HathiTrust]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A renewed interest in mathematics education emerged in the 1960s, and the International Commission was revitalised
* In 1968, the [[Shell Centre for Mathematical Education]] was established in [[Nottingham]]
* The first [[International Congress on Mathematical Education]] (ICME) was held in [[Lyon]] in 1969. The second congress was in [[Exeter]] in 1972, and after that it has been held every four years

In the 20th century, the cultural impact of the "[[Information Age|electronic age]]" (McLuhan) was also taken up by [[educational theory]] and the teaching of mathematics. While previous approach focused on "working with specialized 'problems' in [[arithmetic]]", the emerging structural approach to knowledge had "small children meditating about [[number theory]] and '[[set theory|sets]]'."&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall McLuhan]] (1964) ''[[Understanding Media]]'', p.13 {{cite web|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/McLuhan-Understanding_Media-I-1-7.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208070250/http://georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/McLuhan-Understanding_Media-I-1-7.html |archivedate=2008-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
[[File:ASC Leiden - Coutinho Collection - C 05 - School in Sara, Guinea-Bissau - Boy in front of blackboard - 1974.tif|thumb|Boy doing sums, Guinea-Bissau, 1974.]]
At different times and in different cultures and countries, mathematics education has attempted to achieve a variety of different objectives. These objectives have included:

* The teaching and learning of basic [[numeracy]] skills to all pupils
* The teaching of practical mathematics ([[arithmetic]], [[elementary algebra]], plane and solid [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]]) to most pupils, to equip them to follow a trade or craft
* The teaching of abstract mathematical concepts (such as [[Set (mathematics)|set]] and [[function (mathematics)|function]]) at an early age
* The teaching of selected areas of mathematics (such as [[Euclidean geometry]]) as an example of an [[axiomatic system]] and a model of [[deductive reasoning]]
* The teaching of selected areas of mathematics (such as [[calculus]]) as an example of the intellectual achievements of the [[modern world]]
* The teaching of advanced mathematics to those pupils who wish to follow a career in [[STEM fields|Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)]] fields.
* The teaching of [[heuristics]] and other problem-solving strategies to solve non-routine problems.

==Methods==

The method or methods used in any particular context are largely determined by the objectives that the relevant educational system is trying to achieve. Methods of teaching mathematics include the following:

* '''Classical education''': the teaching of mathematics within the [[quadrivium]], part of the classical education curriculum of the [[Middle Ages]], which was typically based on [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']] taught as a [[paradigm]] of [[deductive reasoning]].
[[File:Number bingo improves math skills LPB Laos.jpg|thumb|Games can motivate students to improve skills that are usually learned by rote. In "Number Bingo," players roll 3 dice, then perform basic mathematical operations on those numbers to get a new number, which they cover on the board trying to cover 4 squares in a row. This game was played at a "Discovery Day" organized by [[Big Brother Mouse]] in Laos.]]
* '''[[Computer-based math]]''' an approach based around use of mathematical software as the primary tool of computation. Mobile applications have also been developed to help students learn mathematics. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techzim.co.zw/2018/06/passing-mathematics-just-got-easier-for-students-with-this-new-platform-mathematica/|title=Passing Mathematics Just Got Easier For Students With This New Platform: Mathematica - Techzim|date=2018-06-16|work=Techzim|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edtechmagazine.com/k12/article/2017/10/5-apps-help-all-students-math|title=5 Apps to Help All Students with Math|date=2017-10-13|work=Technology Solutions That Drive Education|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/22/photomath-app-solve-math-problems_n_6025948.html|title=This Free App Will Solve Math Problems For You|last=Mosbergen|first=Dominique|date=2014-10-22|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Conventional approach''': the gradual and systematic guiding through the hierarchy of mathematical notions, ideas and techniques. Starts with [[arithmetic]] and is followed by [[Euclidean geometry]] and [[elementary algebra]] taught concurrently. Requires the instructor to be well informed about [[elementary mathematics]], since didactic and curriculum decisions are often dictated by the logic of the subject rather than pedagogical considerations. Other methods emerge by emphasizing some aspects of this approach.
* '''[[Exercise (mathematics)|Exercise]]s''': the reinforcement of mathematical skills by completing large numbers of exercises of a similar type, such as adding [[vulgar fraction]]s or solving [[quadratic equation]]s.
* '''Historical method''': teaching the [[history of mathematics|development of mathematics]] within an historical, social and cultural context. Provides more [[human interest]] than the conventional approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bharath |last=Sriraman |title=Crossroads in the History of Mathematics and Mathematics Education |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P38a50_NT8oC |year=2012 |publisher=IAP |isbn=978-1-61735-704-6 |series=Monograph Series in Mathematics Education |volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Mathematics mastery|Mastery]]''': an approach in which most students are expected to achieve a high level of competence before progressing
* '''[[New Math]]''': a method of teaching mathematics which focuses on abstract concepts such as [[set theory]], functions and bases other than ten. Adopted in the US as a response to the challenge of early Soviet technical superiority in space, it began to be challenged in the late 1960s. One of the most influential critiques of the New Math was [[Morris Kline]]'s 1973 book ''[[Why Johnny Can't Add]]''. The New Math method was the topic of one of [[Tom Lehrer]]'s most popular parody songs, with his introductory remarks to the song: "...in the new approach, as you know, the important thing is to understand what you're doing, rather than to get the right answer."
* '''[[Problem solving]]''': the cultivation of mathematical ingenuity, creativity and [[heuristic]] thinking by setting students open-ended, unusual, and sometimes unsolved problems. The problems can range from simple [[word problem (mathematics education)|word problem]]s to problems from international [[mathematics competitions]] such as the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]]. Problem solving is used as a means to build new mathematical knowledge, typically by building on students' prior understandings.
* '''[[Recreational mathematics]]''': Mathematical problems that are fun can motivate students to learn mathematics and can increase enjoyment of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=David Singmaster |first=David |last=Singmaster |title=The Unreasonable Utility of Recreational Mathematics |date=7 September 1993 |work=For First European Congress of Mathematics, Paris, July, 1992 |url=http://anduin.eldar.org/%7Eproblemi/singmast/ecmutil.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Reform mathematics|Standards-based mathematics]]''': a vision for pre-college mathematics education in the [[United States|US]] and [[Canada]], focused on deepening student understanding of mathematical ideas and procedures, and formalized by the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] which created the [[Principles and Standards for School Mathematics]].
* '''Relational approach''': Uses class topics to solve everyday problems and relates the topic to current events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.unl.edu/~s-kfield1/203currentevent.htm%20 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120085344/http://www.math.unl.edu/~s-kfield1/203currentevent.htm |archivedate=2011-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach focuses on the many uses of mathematics and helps students understand why they need to know it as well as helping them to apply mathematics to real world situations outside of the classroom.
* '''[[Rote learning]]''': the teaching of mathematical results, definitions and concepts by repetition and memorisation typically without meaning or supported by mathematical reasoning. A derisory term is ''drill and kill''. In [[traditional education]], rote learning is used to teach [[multiplication table]]s, definitions, formulas, and other aspects of mathematics.

==Content and age levels==
Different levels of mathematics are taught at different ages and in somewhat different sequences in different countries. Sometimes a class may be taught at an earlier age than typical as a special or [[honors class]].

Elementary mathematics in most countries is taught in a similar fashion, though there are differences. In the [[Mathematics education in the United States|United States]] fractions are typically taught starting from 1st grade, whereas in other countries they are usually taught later, since the metric system does not require young children to be familiar with them.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Most countries tend to cover fewer topics in greater depth than in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Foundations for Success: The Final Report of the National Mathematics Advisory Panel |year=2008 |publisher=U.S. Department of Education |url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/mathpanel/report/final-report.pdf |page=20 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  K-12 topics include [[elementary arithmetic]] (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and [[pre-algebra]].

In most of the U.S., [[algebra]], [[geometry]] and analysis ([[pre-calculus]] and [[calculus]]) are taught as separate courses in different years of high school. Mathematics in most other countries (and in a few U.S. states) is integrated, with topics from all branches of mathematics studied every year. Students in many countries choose an option or pre-defined course of study rather than choosing courses ''à la carte'' as in the United States. Students in science-oriented curricula typically study [[differential calculus]] and [[trigonometry]] at age 16–17 and [[integral calculus]], [[complex numbers]], [[analytic geometry]], [[exponential function|exponential]] and [[logarithmic function]]s, and [[infinite series]] in their final year of secondary school. [[Probability]] and [[statistics]] may be taught in secondary education classes.

Science and engineering students in colleges and universities may be required to take [[multivariable calculus]], [[differential equations]], [[linear algebra]].  [[Applied mathematics]] is also used in specific majors; for example, [[civil engineers]] may be required to study [[fluid mechanics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cee.mit.edu/undergraduate/1C-degreerequirements |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714233214/https://cee.mit.edu/undergraduate/1C-degreerequirements |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while "math for computer science" might include [[graph theory]], [[permutation]], probability, and proofs.&lt;ref&gt;http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematics students would continue to study potentially any area.

==Standards==
Throughout most of history, standards for mathematics education were set locally, by individual schools or teachers, depending on the levels of achievement that were relevant to, realistic for, and considered socially appropriate for their pupils.

In modern times, there has been a move towards regional or national standards, usually under the umbrella of a wider standard school curriculum. In [[England]], for example, standards for mathematics education are set as part of the National Curriculum for England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mathematics curriculum |date=17 January 2013 |publisher=UK Department of Education |url=http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/teachingandlearning/curriculum/secondary/b00199003/mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Scotland maintains its own educational system. In the USA, the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices and the Council of Chief State School Officers have published the national mathematics [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]].

Ma (2000) summarised the research of others who found, based on nationwide data, that students with higher scores on standardised mathematics tests had taken more mathematics courses in high school. This led some states to require three years of mathematics instead of two. But because this requirement was often met by taking another lower level mathematics course, the additional courses had a “diluted” effect in raising achievement levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ma, X. |title=A longitudinal assessment of antecedent course work in mathematics and subsequent mathematical attainment |journal=Journal of Educational Research |volume=94 |issue=1 |pages=16–29 |year=2000 |doi=10.1080/00220670009598739 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220670009598739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] has published the [[Principles and Standards for School Mathematics]], which boosted the trend towards [[reform mathematics]]. In 2006, they released ''Curriculum Focal Points'', which recommend the most important mathematical topics for each grade level through grade 8.  However, these standards are enforced as American states and Canadian provinces choose. A US state's adoption of the Common Core State Standards in mathematics is at the discretion of the state, and is not mandated by the Federal Government. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.corestandards.org/about-the-standards/myths-vs-facts/&lt;/ref&gt;"States routinely review their academic standards and may choose to change or add onto the standards to best meet the needs of their students." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.corestandards.org/standards-in-your-state/&lt;/ref&gt; The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics has state affiliates that have different education standards at the state level. For example, Missouri has the Missouri Council of Teachers of Mathematics (MCTM) which has its own pillars and standards of education listed on its website. The MCTM also offers membership opportunities to teachers and future teachers so they can stay up to date on the changes in math educational standards. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.moctm.org/Home.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

"Robust, useful theories of classroom teaching do not yet exist".&lt;ref name=HiebertGrouws&gt;{{Citation | last = Hiebert | first = James | last2 = Grouws | first2 = Douglas | title = The Effects of Classroom Mathematics Teaching on Students' Learning | place = Reston VA | publisher = National Council of Teachers of Mathematics | volume = 1 | year = 2007 | chapter = 9 | pages = 371–404}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are useful theories on how children learn mathematics and much research has been conducted in recent decades to explore how these theories can be applied to teaching. The following results are examples of some of the current findings in the field of mathematics education:

;Important results&lt;ref name=HiebertGrouws/&gt;
:One of the strongest results in recent research is that the most important feature in effective teaching is giving students "opportunity to learn". Teachers can set expectations, time, kinds of tasks, questions, acceptable answers, and type of discussions that will influence students' opportunity to learn. This must involve both skill efficiency and conceptual understanding.

;Conceptual understanding&lt;ref name=HiebertGrouws/&gt;
:Two of the most important features of teaching in the promotion of conceptual understanding are attending explicitly to concepts and allowing students to struggle with important mathematics. Both of these features have been confirmed through a wide variety of studies. Explicit attention to concepts involves making connections between facts, procedures and ideas. (This is often seen as one of the strong points in mathematics teaching in East Asian countries, where teachers typically devote about half of their time to making connections. At the other extreme is the U.S.A., where essentially no connections are made in school classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Institute of Education Sciences | contribution = Highlights From the TIMSS 1999 Video Study of Eighth-Grade Mathematics Teaching | year = 2003 | publisher = U.S. Department of Education | url = http://nces.ed.gov/timss}}&lt;/ref&gt;) These connections can be made through explanation of the meaning of a procedure, questions comparing strategies and solutions of problems, noticing how one problem is a special case of another, reminding students of the main point, discussing how lessons connect, and so on.

:Deliberate, productive struggle with mathematical ideas refers to the fact that when students exert effort with important mathematical ideas, even if this struggle initially involves confusion and errors, the end result is greater learning. This has been shown to be true whether the struggle is due to challenging, well-implemented teaching, or due to faulty teaching the students must struggle to make sense of.
 
;Formative assessment&lt;ref name=BlackWiliam&gt;{{cite journal |last=Black |first=P. |last2=Wiliam |first2=Dylan |title=Assessment and Classroom Learning |journal=Assessment in Education |year=1998 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=7–74 |doi=10.1080/0969595980050102 |url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/t4/learningandteaching/files/PGCTHE/BlackandWiliam1998.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[Formative assessment]] is both the best and cheapest way to boost student achievement, student engagement and teacher professional satisfaction. Results surpass those of reducing class size or increasing teachers' content knowledge. Effective assessment is based on clarifying what students should know, creating appropriate activities to obtain the evidence needed, giving good feedback, encouraging students to take control of their learning and letting students be resources for one another.

;Homework&lt;ref name=ResearchClips&gt;[http://www.nctm.org/news/content.aspx?id=8468 Research clips and briefs]&lt;/ref&gt;
:Homework which leads students to practice past lessons or prepare future lessons are more effective than those going over today's lesson. Students benefit from feedback. Students with learning disabilities or low motivation may profit from rewards. For younger children, homework helps simple skills, but not broader measures of achievement.

;Students with difficulties&lt;ref name=ResearchClips/&gt;
:Students with genuine difficulties (unrelated to motivation or past instruction) struggle with [[Recall of facts|basic facts]], answer impulsively, struggle with mental representations, have poor [[number sense]] and have poor short-term memory. Techniques that have been found productive for helping such students include peer-assisted learning, explicit teaching with visual aids, instruction informed by [[formative assessment]] and encouraging students to think aloud.

;Algebraic reasoning&lt;ref name=ResearchClips/&gt;
:It is important for elementary school children to spend a long time learning to express algebraic properties without symbols before learning algebraic notation. When learning symbols, many students believe letters always represent unknowns and struggle with the concept of [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]. They prefer arithmetic reasoning to algebraic equations for solving word problems. It takes time to move from arithmetic to algebraic generalizations to describe patterns. Students often have trouble with the minus sign and understand the [[equals sign]] to mean "the answer is...."

===Methodology===
As with other educational research (and the social sciences in general), mathematics education research depends on both quantitative and qualitative studies. [[Quantitative research]] includes studies that use [[inferential statistics]] to answer specific questions, such as whether a certain teaching method gives significantly better results than the status quo. The best quantitative studies involve randomized trials where students or classes are randomly assigned different methods in order to test their effects. They depend on large samples to obtain statistically significant results.

[[Qualitative research]], such as [[case studies]], [[action research]], [[discourse analysis]], and [[Jean Piaget|clinical interviews]], depend on small but focused samples in an attempt to understand student learning and to look at how and why a given method gives the results it does. Such studies cannot conclusively establish that one method is better than another, as randomized trials can, but unless it is understood ''why'' treatment X is better than treatment Y, application of results of quantitative studies will often lead to "lethal mutations"&lt;ref name=HiebertGrouws/&gt; of the finding in actual classrooms. Exploratory qualitative research is also useful for suggesting new hypotheses, which can eventually be tested by randomized experiments. Both qualitative and quantitative studies therefore are considered essential in education—just as in the other social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3102/0013189X034005025 | last = Raudenbush | first = Stephen | title = Learning from Attempts to Improve Schooling: The Contribution of Methodological Diversity | journal = Educational Researcher | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 25–31 | year = 2005 | url = http://edr.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/34/5/25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies are “mixed”, simultaneously combining aspects of both quantitative and qualitative research, as appropriate.

====Randomized trials====
There has been some controversy over the relative strengths of different types of research. Because randomized trials provide clear, objective evidence on “what works”, policy makers often take only those studies into consideration. Some scholars have pushed for more random experiments in which teaching methods are randomly assigned to classes.&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thomas D. |last=Cook |title=Randomized Experiments in Educational Policy Research: A Critical Examination of the Reasons the Educational Evaluation Community has Offered for Not Doing Them |journal=Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=175–199 |year=2002 |doi=10.3102/01623737024003175 |url=http://epa.sagepub.com/content/24/3/175.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scheaffer&gt;{{cite web |author=Working Group on Statistics in Mathematics Education Research |title=Using Statistics Effectively in Mathematics Education Research: A report from a series of workshops organized by the American Statistical Association with funding from the National Science Foundation |year=2007 |publisher=The American Statistical Association |url=http://www.amstat.org/research_grants/pdfs/SMERReport.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other disciplines concerned with human subjects, like biomedicine, psychology, and policy evaluation, controlled, randomized experiments remain the preferred method of evaluating treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Shadish, William R. |author2=Cook, Thomas D. |author3=Campbell, Donald T. |year=2002 |title=Experimental and quasi-experimental designs for generalized causal inference |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=0-395-61556-9 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See articles on [[No Child Left Behind|NCLB]], [[National Mathematics Advisory Panel]], [[Scientifically based research]] and [[What Works Clearinghouse]]&lt;/ref&gt; Educational statisticians and some mathematics educators have been working to increase the use of randomized experiments to evaluate teaching methods.&lt;ref name=Scheaffer/&gt; On the other hand, many scholars in educational schools have argued against increasing the number of randomized experiments, often because of philosophical objections, such as the ethical difficulty of randomly assigning students to various treatments when the effects of such treatments are not yet known to be effective,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In the United States, the [[Math_wars#National_Mathematics_Advisory_Panel|National Mathematics Advisory Panel]] (NMAP) published a report in 2008 based on studies, some of which used randomized assignment of treatments to [[experimental unit]]s, such as classrooms or students.  The NMAP report's preference for randomized experiments received criticism from some scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3102/0013189X08329353 | last = Kelly | first = Anthony | title = Reflections on the National Mathematics Advisory Panel Final Report | journal = Educational Researcher | volume = 37 | issue = 9 | pages = 561–4 | year = 2008 | url = http://edr.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/37/9/561 | postscript = .}} This is the introductory article to an issue devoted to this debate on report of the National Mathematics Advisory Panel, particularly on its use of randomized experiments.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the [[What Works Clearinghouse]] (essentially the research arm for the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]]) responded to ongoing controversy by extending its research base to include non-experimental studies, including [[regression discontinuity design]]s and [[Case studies|single-case studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sparks|first=Sarah|title=Federal Criteria For Studies Grow|newspaper=Education Week|date=October 20, 2010|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Microscopic traffic flow models''' are a class of [[Scientific modeling|scientific models]] of [[traffic flow|vehicular traffic dynamics]].

In contrast to [[Macroscopic traffic flow model|macroscopic models]], microscopic traffic flow models simulate single vehicle-driver units, so the dynamic variables of the models represent microscopic properties like the position and velocity of single vehicles.

==Car-following models==
Also known as ''time-continuous models'', all car-following models have in common that they are defined by [[ordinary differential equations]] describing the complete dynamics of the vehicles' positions &lt;math&gt;x_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and velocities &lt;math&gt;v_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. It is assumed that the input stimuli of the drivers are restricted to their own velocity &lt;math&gt;v_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the net distance (bumper-to-bumper distance) &lt;math&gt;s_\alpha = x_{\alpha-1} - x_\alpha - l_{\alpha-1}&lt;/math&gt; to the leading vehicle &lt;math&gt;\alpha-1&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;l_{\alpha-1}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the vehicle length), and the velocity &lt;math&gt;v_{\alpha-1}&lt;/math&gt; of the leading vehicle. The [[equation of motion]] of each vehicle is characterized by an acceleration function that depends on those input stimuli:

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}_\alpha(t) = \dot{v}_\alpha(t) = F(v_\alpha(t), s_\alpha(t), v_{\alpha-1}(t))&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the driving behavior of a single driver-vehicle unit &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; might not merely depend on the immediate leader &lt;math&gt;\alpha-1&lt;/math&gt; but on the &lt;math&gt;n_a&lt;/math&gt; vehicles in front. The equation of motion in this more generalized form reads:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{v}_\alpha(t) = f(x_\alpha(t), v_\alpha(t), x_{\alpha-1}(t), v_{\alpha-1}(t), \ldots, x_{\alpha-n_a}(t), v_{\alpha-n_a}(t))&lt;/math&gt;

===Examples of car-following models===
* [[Optimal velocity model]] (OVM)
* [[Velocity difference model]] (VDIFF)
* [[VISSIM|Wiedemann model]] (1974)
* [[Intelligent driver model]] (IDM, 1999)
** [http://volkhin.com/RoadTrafficSimulator/ RoadTrafficSimulator - visualization of the model]
* [[Gipps' model]] (Gipps, 1981)

==Cellular automaton models==
[[Cellular automaton]] (CA) models use integer variables to describe the dynamical properties of the system. The road is divided into sections of a certain length &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; and the time is [[discretization|discretized]] to steps of &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;. Each road section can either be occupied by a vehicle or empty and the dynamics are given by update rules of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;v_\alpha^{t+1} = f(s_\alpha^t, v_\alpha^t, v_{\alpha-1}^t, \ldots)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_\alpha^{t+1} = x_\alpha^t + v_\alpha^{t+1}&lt;/math&gt;

(the simulation time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is measured in units of &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; and the vehicle positions &lt;math&gt;x_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in units of &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;).

The time scale is typically given by the reaction time of a human driver, &lt;math&gt;\Delta t = 1 \text{s}&lt;/math&gt;. With &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; fixed, the length of the road sections determines the granularity of the model. At a complete standstill, the average road length occupied by one vehicle is approximately 7.5 meters. Setting &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; to this value leads to a model where one vehicle always occupies exactly one section of the road and a velocity of 5 corresponds to &lt;math&gt;5 \Delta x/\Delta t = 135 \text{km/h}&lt;/math&gt;, which is then set to be the maximum velocity a driver wants to drive at. However, in such a model, the smallest possible acceleration would be &lt;math&gt;\Delta x/(\Delta t)^2 = 7.5 \text{m}/\text{s}^2&lt;/math&gt; which is unrealistic. Therefore, many modern CA models use a finer spatial discretization, for example &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = 1.5 \text{m}&lt;/math&gt;, leading to a smallest possible acceleration of &lt;math&gt;1.5 \text{m}/\text{s}^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Although cellular automaton models lack the accuracy of the time-continuous car-following models, they still have the ability to reproduce a wide range of traffic phenomena. Due to the simplicity of the models, they are numerically very efficient and can be used to simulate large road networks in realtime or even faster.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3579">The '''Moschovakis coding lemma''' is a [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] from descriptive [[set theory]] involving sets of [[real number]]s in the [[axiom of determinacy]] (the principle that every two-player integer game is determined). The lemma was developed and named after the mathematician, [[Yiannis N. Moschovakis]].

The lemma may be expressed generally as follows:

Let Γ be a non-selfdual point-class closed under ∃ ω ω and ∧ , and ≺ a Γ well-founded relation on ω ω of rank θ ∈ ON. Let R ⊆ dom( ≺ ) × ω ω be such that ∀ x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∃ y R ( x,y ) . Then there is a Γ set A ⊆ dom( ≺ ) × ω ω which is a choice set for R , that is: 1. ∀ α &lt; θ ∃ x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∃ y [ | x | ≺ = α ∧ A ( x,y )] . 2. ∀ x ∀ y A ( x,y ) → [ x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∧ R ( x,y )] . Proof. We may assume θ is minimal so that the theorem fails, and fix ≺ , R , and a good universal set U ⊆ ( ω ω ) 3 for the Γ subsets of ( ω ω ) 2 . Easily, θ is a limit ordinal. For δ &lt; θ , say u ∈ ω ω codes a δ -choice set provided (1) holds for α ≤ δ using A = U u , and (2) holds for A = U u where we replace x ∈ dom( ≺ ) with x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∧| x | ≺ ≤ δ . By minimality of θ , for all δ &lt; θ there are δ -choice sets. Play the game where I, II play out u,v ∈ ω ω , and II wins provided that if u codes a δ 1 -choice set for some δ 1 &lt; θ , then v codes a δ 2 -choice set for some δ 2 &gt; δ 1 . If I has a winning strategy, we get a Σ 1 1 set B of reals coding δ -choice sets for arbitrarily large δ &lt; θ . Define then A ( x,y ) ↔∃ w ∈ B U ( w,x,y ), which easily works. Suppose now τ is a winning strategy for II. From the s - m - n theorem, let s : ( ω ω ) 2 → ω ω be continuous such that for all {{lang|el|ϵ}},x,t,w, U ( s ({{lang|el|ϵ}},x ) ,t,w ) ↔ ∃ y ∃ z [ y ≺ x ∧ U ({{lang|el|ϵ}},y,z ) ∧ U ( z,t,w )]. By the recursion theorem, let {{lang|el|ϵ}} 0 be such that U ({{lang|el|ϵ}}0 ,x,z ) ↔ z = τ ( s ({{lang|el|ϵ}}0 ,x )). A straightforward induction on | x | ≺ for x ∈ dom( ≺ ) shows that ∀ x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∃ ! z U ( {{lang|el|ϵ}}0 ,x,z ), and ∀ x ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∀ z [ U ( {{lang|el|ϵ}}0 ,x,z ) → z codes a ≥| x | ≺ -choice set]. Let A ( x,y ) ↔∃ z ∈ dom( ≺ ) ∃ w [ U ( {{lang|el|ϵ}}0 ,z,w ) ∧ U ( w,x,y )].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''[[Music theory]]''' has no [[axiomatic]] foundation in modern [[mathematics]], yet the basis of musical [[sound]] can be described mathematically (in [[acoustics]]) and exhibits "a remarkable array of number properties".&lt;ref&gt;[[Reginald Smith Brindle]], ''The New Music'', Oxford University Press, 1987, pp 42-3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elements of music]] such as its [[Musical form|form]], [[rhythm]] and [[Meter (music)|metre]], the [[pitch (music)|pitches]] of its [[Musical note|notes]] and the [[Tempo (music)|tempo]] of its [[Pulse (music)|pulse]] can be related to the [[Chronometry|measurement of time]] and [[frequency]], offering ready [[Analogical models|analogies]] in [[geometry]].   

The attempt to structure and communicate new ways of composing and hearing music has led to musical applications of [[set theory]], [[abstract algebra]] and [[number theory]]. Some composers have incorporated the [[golden ratio]] and [[Fibonacci numbers]] into their work.&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Smith Brindle, ''The New Music'', Oxford University Press, 1987, Chapter 6 ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eric - Math and Music: Harmonious Connections |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=ED388615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Though ancient Chinese, Indians, Egyptians and Mesopotamians are known to have studied the mathematical principles of sound,&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Smith Brindle, ''The New Music'', Oxford University Press, 1987, p 42&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] (in particular [[Philolaus]] and [[Archytas]])&lt;ref name="purwins"&gt;{{cite book|title=Profiles of Pitch Classes Circularity of Relative Pitch and Key-Experiments, Models, Computational Music Analysis, and Perspectives|pages=22-24|year=2005|url=http://ccrma.stanford.edu/~purwins/purwinsPhD.pdf|last1=Purwins | first1=Hendrik}}&lt;/ref&gt; of ancient Greece were the first researchers known to have investigated the expression of [[musical scale]]s in terms of numerical [[ratio]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Plato (trans. Desmond Lee) ''The Republic'', Harmondsworth Penguin 1974, page 340, note.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the ratios of small integers. Their central doctrine was that "all nature consists of [[harmony]] arising out of numbers".&lt;ref&gt;Sir James Jeans, ''Science and Music'', Dover 1968, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of [[Plato]], harmony was considered a fundamental branch of [[physics]], now known as [[musical acoustics]]. Early [[Indian music scale|Indian]] and [[Chinese musicology|Chinese]] theorists show similar approaches: all sought to show that the mathematical laws of [[harmonic]]s and [[rhythm]]s were fundamental not only to our understanding of the world but to human well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Danielou, ''Introduction to the Study of Musical Scales'', Mushiram Manoharlal 1999, Chapter 1 ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Confucius]], like Pythagoras, regarded the small numbers 1,2,3,4 as the source of all perfection.&lt;ref&gt;Sir James Jeans, ''Science and Music'', Dover 1968, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time, rhythm and meter==

Without the boundaries of rhythmic structure – a fundamental equal and regular arrangement of [[Pulse (music)|pulse]] [[Repetition (music)|repetition]], [[Beat (music)|accent]], [[Phrase (music)|phrase]] and duration – music would not be possible.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Whittall, in ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', OUP, 2002, Article: ''Rhythm''&lt;/ref&gt; Modern musical use of terms like [[Meter (music)|meter]] and [[bar (music)|measure]] also reflects the historical importance of music, along with astronomy, in the development of counting, arithmetic and the exact measurement of time and [[Frequency|periodicity]] that is fundamental to physics.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The elements of musical form often build strict proportions or hypermetric structures (powers of the numbers 2 and 3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Александр Виноград, Многообразие проявлений музыкального метра (LAP Lambert Academic Publishing, 2013)|url=https://www.morebooks.de/store/gb/book/%D0%9C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%8F%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE-%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0/isbn/978-3-659-48005-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical form==
{{Main|Musical form}}
Musical form is the plan by which a short piece of music is extended. The term "plan" is also used in architecture, to which musical form is often compared. Like the architect, the composer must take into account the function for which the work is intended and the means available, practicing economy and making use of repetition and order.&lt;ref&gt;Imogen Holst, ''The ABC of Music'', Oxford 1963, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; The common types of form known as [[Binary form|binary]] and [[Ternary form|ternary]] ("twofold" and "threefold") once again demonstrate the importance of small integral values to the intelligibility and appeal of music.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Frequency and harmony==
[[Image:Chladini.Diagrams.for.Quadratic.Plates.svg|thumb|220px|Chladni figures produced by sound vibrations in fine powder on a square plate. ([[Ernst Chladni]], ''Acoustics'', 1802)]]
A [[musical scale]] is a discrete set of [[pitch (music)|pitch]]es used in making or describing music. The most important scale in the Western tradition is the [[diatonic scale]] but many others have been used and proposed in various historical eras and parts of the world. Each pitch corresponds to a particular frequency, expressed in hertz (Hz), sometimes referred to as cycles per second (c.p.s.). A scale has an interval of repetition, normally the [[octave]]. The [[octave]] of any pitch refers to a frequency exactly twice that of the given pitch.

Succeeding superoctaves are pitches found at frequencies four, eight, sixteen times, and so on, of the fundamental frequency. Pitches at frequencies of half, a quarter, an eighth and so on of the fundamental are called suboctaves. There is no case in musical harmony where, if a given pitch be considered accordant, that its octaves are considered otherwise. Therefore, any note and its octaves will generally be found similarly named in musical systems (e.g. all will be called '''doh''' or '''A''' or '''Sa''', as the case may be).

When expressed as a frequency bandwidth an octave '''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' spans from 110&amp;nbsp;Hz to 220&amp;nbsp;Hz (span=110&amp;nbsp;Hz). The next octave will span from 220&amp;nbsp;Hz to 440&amp;nbsp;Hz (span=220&amp;nbsp;Hz). The third octave spans from 440&amp;nbsp;Hz to 880&amp;nbsp;Hz (span=440&amp;nbsp;Hz) and so on. Each successive octave spans twice the frequency range of the previous octave.

[[Image:4Octaves.and.Frequencies.Ears.svg|thumb|500px|center|This diagram presents octaves as they appear in the sense of musical intervals, equally spaced.]]

Because we are often interested in the relations or [[ratio]]s between the pitches (known as [[Interval (music)|intervals]]) rather than the precise pitches themselves in describing a scale, it is usual to refer to all the scale pitches in terms of their ratio from a particular pitch, which is given the value of one (often written '''1/1'''), generally a note which functions as the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] of the scale. For interval size comparison, [[cent (music)|cent]]s are often used.

==Tuning systems==
{{Main|Musical tuning|Musical temperament}}

There are two main families of tuning systems: [[equal temperament]] and [[just tuning]]. Equal temperament scales are built by dividing an octave into intervals which are equal on a [[logarithmic scale]], which results in perfectly evenly divided scales, but with ratios of frequencies which are [[irrational number]]s. Just scales are built by multiplying frequencies by [[rational number]]s, which results in simple ratios between frequencies, but with scale divisions that are uneven.

One major difference between equal temperament tunings and just tunings is differences in [[Beat (acoustics)|acoustical beat]] when two notes are sounded together, which affects the subjective experience of [[consonance and dissonance]]. Both of these systems, and the vast majority of music in general, have scales that repeat on the interval of every [[octave]], which is defined as frequency ratio of 2:1. In other words, every time the frequency is doubled, the given scale repeats.

Below are [[Ogg Vorbis]] files demonstrating the difference between just intonation and equal temperament. You may need to play the samples several times before you can pick the difference.
*[[Media:Comparison 550Hz - 554Hz.ogg|Two sine waves played consecutively]] – this sample has half-step at 550&amp;nbsp;Hz (C{{music|#}} in the just intonation scale), followed by a half-step at 554.37&amp;nbsp;Hz (C{{music|#}} in the equal temperament scale).
*[[Media:Major third comparison.ogg|Same two notes, set against an A440 pedal]] – this sample consists of a "[[Dyad (music)|dyad]]". The lower note is a constant A (440&amp;nbsp;Hz in either scale), the upper note is a C{{music|#}} in the equal-tempered scale for the first 1", and a C{{music|#}} in the just intonation scale for the last 1". [[Beat (acoustics)|Phase]] differences make it easier to pick the transition than in the previous sample.

===Just tunings===
[[5-limit tuning]], the most common form of [[just intonation]], is a system of tuning using tones that are [[regular number]] [[harmonic]]s of a single [[fundamental frequency]]. This was one of the scales [[Johannes Kepler]] presented in his [[Harmonices Mundi]] (1619) in connection with planetary motion. The same scale was given in transposed form by Scottish mathematician and musical theorist, Alexander Malcolm, in 1721 in his 'Treatise of Musick: Speculative, Practical and Historical',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/treatiseofmusick00malc|title=A treatise of musick, speculative, practical and historical|first1=Alexander|last1=Malcolm|first2=Mr (Joseph)|last2=Mitchell|date=25 May 2018|publisher=Edinburgh : Printed for the author|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by theorist [[Jose Wuerschmidt]] in the 20th century. A form of it is used in the music of northern India.

American composer [[Terry Riley]] also made use of the inverted form of it in his "Harp of New Albion". Just intonation gives superior results when there is little or no [[chord progression]]: voices and other instruments gravitate to just intonation whenever possible. However, it gives two different whole tone intervals (9:8 and 10:9) because a fixed tuned instrument, such as a piano, cannot change key.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Montagu, in ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', OUP 2002, Article: ''just intonation''.&lt;/ref&gt; To calculate the frequency of a note in a scale given in terms of ratios, the frequency ratio is multiplied by the tonic frequency. For instance, with a tonic of [[A440 (pitch standard)|A4]] (A natural above middle C), the frequency is 440&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]], and a justly tuned fifth above it (E5) is simply 440×(3:2) = 660&amp;nbsp;Hz.

[[Pythagorean tuning]] is tuning based only on the perfect consonances, the (perfect) octave, perfect fifth, and perfect fourth. Thus the major third is considered not a third but a ditone, literally "two tones", and is (9:8)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 81:64, rather than the independent and harmonic just 5:4 = 80:64 directly below. A whole tone is a secondary interval, being derived from two perfect fifths, (3:2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9:8.

The just major third, 5:4 and minor third, 6:5, are a [[syntonic comma]], 81:80, apart from their Pythagorean equivalents 81:64 and 32:27 respectively. According to [[Carl Dahlhaus|Carl]] {{harvtxt|Dahlhaus|1990|p=187}}, "the dependent third conforms to the Pythagorean, the independent third to the harmonic tuning of intervals."

Western [[common practice period|common practice music]] usually cannot be played in just intonation but requires a systematically tempered scale. The tempering can involve either the irregularities of [[well temperament]] or be constructed as a [[regular tuning and temperament|regular temperament]], either some form of [[equal temperament]] or some other regular meantone, but in all cases will involve the fundamental features of [[meantone temperament]]. For example, the root of chord '''ii''', if tuned to a fifth above the dominant, would be a major whole tone (9:8) above the tonic. If tuned a just minor third (6:5) below a just subdominant degree of 4:3, however, the interval from the tonic would equal a minor whole tone (10:9). Meantone temperament reduces the difference between 9:8 and 10:9. Their ratio, (9:8)/(10:9) = 81:80, is treated as a unison. The interval 81:80, called the [[syntonic comma]] or comma of Didymus, is the key comma of meantone temperament.

===Equal temperament tunings===
In [[equal temperament]], the octave is divided into equal parts on the logarithmic scale. While it is possible to construct equal temperament scale with any number of notes (for example, the 24-tone [[Arab tone system]]), the most common number is 12, which makes up the equal-temperament [[chromatic scale]]. In western music, a division into twelve intervals is commonly assumed unless it is specified otherwise.

For the chromatic scale, the octave is divided into twelve equal parts, each semitone (half-step) is an interval of the [[twelfth root of two]] so that twelve of these equal half steps add up to exactly an octave. With fretted instruments it is very useful to use equal temperament so that the frets align evenly across the strings. In the European music tradition, equal temperament was used for lute and guitar music far earlier than for other instruments, such as [[musical keyboard]]s. Because of this historical force, twelve-tone equal temperament is now the dominant intonation system in the Western, and much of the non-Western, world.

Equally tempered scales have been used and instruments built using various other numbers of equal intervals. The [[19 equal temperament]], first proposed and used by [[Guillaume Costeley]] in the 16th century, uses 19 equally spaced tones, offering better major thirds and far better minor thirds than normal 12-semitone equal temperament at the cost of a flatter fifth. The overall effect is one of greater consonance. [[Quarter tone|Twenty-four equal temperament]], with twenty-four equally spaced tones, is widespread in the pedagogy and [[Arabic maqam#Notation|notation]] of [[Arabic music]]. However, in theory and practice, the intonation of Arabic music conforms to [[Rational number|rational ratios]], as opposed to the [[Irrational number|irrational ratios]] of equally tempered systems.&lt;ref name="Touma 1996 22–24"&gt;{{cite book|last=Touma|first=Habib Hassan|title=The Music of the Arabs|year=1996|publisher=Amadeus Press|location=Portland, OR|isbn=0-931340-88-8|pages=22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While any analog to the equally tempered [[quarter tone]] is entirely absent from Arabic intonation systems, analogs to a three-quarter tone, or [[neutral second]], frequently occur. These neutral seconds, however, vary slightly in their ratios dependent on [[Arabic maqam|maqam]], as well as geography. Indeed, Arabic music historian [[Habib Hassan Touma]] has written that "the breadth of deviation of this musical step is a crucial ingredient in the peculiar flavor of Arabian music. To temper the scale by dividing the octave into twenty-four quarter-tones of equal size would be to surrender one of the most characteristic elements of this musical culture."&lt;ref name="Touma 1996 22–24"/&gt;

==Connections to mathematics==
===Set theory===
{{Main|Set theory (music)}}
Musical set theory uses the language of mathematical [[set theory]] in an elementary way to organize musical objects and describe their relationships. To analyze the structure of a piece of (typically atonal) music using musical set theory, one usually starts with a set of tones, which could form motives or chords. By applying simple operations such as [[transposition (music)|transposition]] and [[Melodic inversion|inversion]], one can discover deep structures in the music. Operations such as transposition and inversion are called [[isometries]] because they preserve the intervals between tones in a set.

===Abstract algebra===
{{Main|Abstract algebra}}
Expanding on the methods of musical set theory, some theorists have used abstract algebra to analyze music. For example, the pitch classes in an equally tempered octave form an [[abelian group]] with 12 elements. It is possible to describe [[just intonation]] in terms of a [[free abelian group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Algebra of Tonal Functions. |url=http://sonantometry.blogspot.com/2007_05_01_archive.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harmonic Limit|url=https://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Harmonic+Limit||}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transformational theory]] is a branch of music theory developed by [[David Lewin]]. The theory allows for great generality because it emphasizes transformations between musical objects, rather than the musical objects themselves.

Theorists have also proposed musical applications of more sophisticated algebraic concepts. The theory of regular temperaments has been extensively developed with a wide range of sophisticated mathematics, for example by associating each regular temperament with a rational point on a [[Grassmannian]].

The [[chromatic scale]] has a free and transitive action of the [[cyclic group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, with the action being defined via [[transposition (music)|transposition]] of notes. So the chromatic scale can be thought of as a [[torsor]] for the group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Real and complex analysis===
Real and complex analysis have also been made use of, for instance by applying the theory of the [[Riemann zeta function]] to the study of equal divisions of the octave.[https://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/The+Riemann+Zeta+Function+and+Tuning]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16192">{{about|the formal terminology in logic|causal meanings of the terms|Causality|the concepts in statistics|Sufficient statistic}}In [[logic]], '''necessity''' and '''sufficiency''' are terms used to describe a [[material conditional|conditional]] or implicational relationship between [[Statement (logic)|statements]]. For example, in the conditional statement "If P then Q", we say that "Q is '''necessary''' for P" because P cannot be true unless Q is true. Similarly, we say that "P is '''sufficient''' for Q" because P being true always implies that Q is true, but P not being true does not always imply that Q is not true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proofs and Fundamentals: A First Course in Abstract Mathematics|last=Bloch|first=Ethan D.|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4419-7126-5|location=|pages=8-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The assertion that a statement is a "necessary ''and'' sufficient" condition of another means that the former statement is true [[if and only if]] the latter is true. That is, the two statements must be either simultaneously true or simultaneously false.&lt;ref name=betz&gt;{{cite book|last=Betz|first=Frederick|title=Managing Science: Methodology and Organization of Research|date=2011|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-7487-7|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Manktelow&gt;{{cite book|last=Manktelow|first=K.

In [[ordinary English]], "necessary" and "sufficient" indicate relations between conditions or states of affairs, not statements. Being a male sibling is a necessary and sufficient condition for being a brother.

==Definitions==

In the conditional statement, "if ''S'', then ''N''", the expression represented by ''S'' is called the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and the expression represented by ''N'' is called the [[consequent]]. This conditional statement may be written in many equivalent ways, for instance, "''N'' if ''S''", "''S'' only if ''N''", "''S'' implies ''N''", "''N'' is implied by ''S''", {{math|''S'' → ''N''}} , {{math|''S'' ⇒ ''N''}}, or "''N'' whenever ''S''".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Keith|last=Devlin|title=Sets, Functions and Logic / An Introduction to Abstract Mathematics|edition=3rd|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall|year=2004|isbn=978-1-58488-449-1|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the above situation, we also say that ''N'' is a '''necessary''' condition for ''S''. In common language this is saying that if the conditional statement is a true statement, then the consequent ''N'' must be true if ''S'' may at all be true (see "[[truth table]]" immediately below). Phrased differently, the antecedent ''S'' cannot be true without ''N'' being true. For example, in order for someone to be called '''''S'''''ocrates, it is necessary for that someone to be '''''N'''''amed.

We also say that ''S'' is a '''sufficient''' condition for ''N''. Consider the truth table again. If the conditional statement is true, then if ''S'' is true, ''N'' must be true; whereas if the conditional statement is true and N is true, then S may be true or  be false. In common terms, "''S'' guarantees ''N''". Continuing the example, knowing that someone is called '''''S'''''ocrates is sufficient to know that someone has a '''''N'''''ame.

A '''''necessary and sufficient''''' condition requires that both of the implications &lt;math&gt;S \Rightarrow N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N \Rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; (which can also be written as &lt;math&gt;S \Leftarrow N&lt;/math&gt;)  hold. From the first of these we see that ''S'' is a sufficient condition for ''N'', and from the second that ''S'' is a necessary condition for ''N''. This is expressed as "''S'' is necessary and sufficient for ''N'' ", "''S'' [[if and only if]] ''N'' ", or &lt;math&gt;S \Leftrightarrow N&lt;/math&gt;.

==Necessity==

[[File:Solar eclipse 1999 4 NR.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The sun being above the horizon is a necessary condition for direct sunlight; but it is not a sufficient condition, as something else may be casting a shadow, e.g., the moon in the case of an [[solar eclipse|eclipse]].]]

The assertion that ''Q'' is necessary for ''P'' is colloquially equivalent to "''P'' cannot be true unless ''Q'' is true" or "if Q is false, then P is false". By [[contraposition]], this is the same thing as "whenever ''P'' is true, so is ''Q''".

The logical relation between ''P'' and ''Q'' is expressed as "if ''P'', then ''Q''" and denoted "''P'' ⇒ ''Q''" (''P'' [[Logical consequence|implies]] ''Q''). It may also be expressed as any of "''P'' only if ''Q''", "''Q'', if ''P''", "''Q'' whenever ''P''", and "''Q'' when ''P''". One often finds, in mathematical prose for instance, several necessary conditions that, taken together, constitute a sufficient condition, as shown in Example 5.

;Example 1: For it to be true that "John is a bachelor", it is necessary that it be also true that he is
:# unmarried,
:# male,
:# adult,
:since to state "John is a bachelor" implies John has each of those three additional [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]].

;Example 2: For the whole numbers greater than two, being odd is necessary to being prime, since two is the only whole number that is both even and prime.

;Example 3: Consider thunder, the sound caused by lightning. We say that thunder is necessary for lightning, since lightning never occurs without thunder. Whenever there's lightning, there's thunder. The thunder ''does not cause'' the lightning (since lightning causes thunder), but because lightning always comes with thunder, we say that thunder is necessary for lightning. (That is, in its formal sense, necessity doesn't imply causality.)

;Example 4: Being at least 30 years old is necessary for serving in the U.S. Senate.  If you are under 30 years old, then it is impossible for you to be a senator.  That is, if you are a senator, it follows that you are at least 30 years old.

;Example 5: In [[algebra]], for some [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' together with an [[Binary operation|operation]] &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; to form a [[group (mathematics)|group]], it is necessary that &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; be [[associative]].  It is also necessary that ''S'' include a special element ''e'' such that for every ''x'' in ''S'' it is the case that ''e'' &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' and ''x'' &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ''e'' both equal ''x''.  It is also necessary that for every ''x'' in ''S'' there exist a corresponding element ''x'' "such that both ''x'' &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' " and ''x''" &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' equal the special element ''e''.  None of these three necessary conditions by itself is sufficient, but the [[conjunction (logic)|conjunction]] of the three is.

==Sufficiency==

[[File:ICE 3 Fahlenbach.jpg|thumb|right|200px|That a train runs on schedule can be a sufficient condition for arriving on time (if one boards the train and it departs on time, then one will arrive on time); but it is not always a necessary condition, since there are other ways to travel (if the train does not run to time, one could still arrive on time through other means of transport).]]

If ''P'' is sufficient for ''Q'', then knowing ''P'' to be true is adequate grounds to conclude that ''Q'' is true; however, knowing ''P'' to be false does not meet a minimal need to conclude that ''Q'' is false.

The logical relation is, as before, expressed as "if ''P'', then ''Q''" or "''P'' ⇒ ''Q''". This can also be expressed as "''P'' only if ''Q''", "''P'' implies ''Q''" or several other variants. It may be the case that several sufficient conditions, when taken together, constitute a single necessary condition, as illustrated in example 5.

;Example 1: "John is a king" implies that John is male. So knowing that it is true that John is a king is sufficient to know that he is a male.

;Example 2: A number's being divisible by 4 is sufficient (but not necessary) for its being even, but being divisible by 2 is both sufficient and necessary.

;Example 3: An occurrence of thunder is a sufficient condition for the occurrence of lightning in the sense that hearing thunder, and unambiguously recognizing it as such, justifies concluding that there has been a lightning bolt.

;Example 4: If the U.S. Congress passes a bill, the president's signature of the bill is sufficient to make it law. Note that the case whereby the president did not sign the bill, e.g. through exercising a presidential [[veto#United States|veto]], does not mean that the bill has not become law (it could still have become law through a congressional [[veto override|override]]).

;Example 5: That the center of a [[playing card]] should be marked with a single large spade (♠) is sufficient for the card to be an ace.  Three other sufficient conditions are that the center of the card be marked with a diamond (♦), heart (♥), or club (♣), respectively.  None of these conditions is necessary to the card's being an ace, but their [[disjunction]] is, since no card can be an ace without fulfilling at least (in fact, exactly) one of the conditions.

==Relationship between necessity and sufficiency==
[[File:Set intersection.svg|thumb|260 px|Being in the purple region is sufficient for being in A, but not necessary. Being in A is necessary for being in the purple region, but not sufficient. Being in A and being in B is necessary and sufficient for being in the purple region.]]

A condition can be either necessary or sufficient without being the other.  For instance, ''being a [[mammal]]'' (''N'') is necessary but not sufficient to ''being human'' (''S''), and that a number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ''is rational'' (''S'') is sufficient but not necessary to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ''being a [[real number]]'' (''N'') (since there are real numbers that are not rational).

A condition can be both necessary and sufficient. For example, at present, "today is the [[Fourth of July]]" is a necessary and sufficient condition for "today is [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] in the [[United States]]".  Similarly, a necessary and sufficient condition for [[Inverse matrix|invertibility]] of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] ''M'' is that ''M'' has a nonzero [[determinant]].

Mathematically speaking, necessity and sufficiency are [[duality (mathematics)|dual]] to one another.  For any statements ''S'' and ''N'', the assertion that "''N'' is necessary for ''S''" is equivalent to the assertion that "''S'' is sufficient for ''N''". Another facet of this duality is that, as illustrated above, conjunctions (using "and") of necessary conditions may achieve sufficiency, while disjunctions (using "or") of sufficient conditions may achieve necessity.  For a third facet, identify every mathematical [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] ''N'' with the set ''T''(''N'') of objects, events, or statements for which ''N'' holds true; then asserting the necessity of ''N'' for ''S'' is equivalent to claiming that ''T''(''N'') is a [[superset]] of ''T''(''S''), while asserting the sufficiency of ''S'' for ''N'' is equivalent to claiming that ''T''(''S'') is a [[subset]] of ''T''(''N'').

==Simultaneous necessity and sufficiency==
{{See also|Material equivalence}}

To say that ''P'' is necessary and sufficient for ''Q'' is to say two things:
# that ''P'' is necessary for ''Q'',  &lt;math&gt;P \Leftarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;, and that ''P'' is sufficient for ''Q'', &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;.  
# equivalently, it may be understood to say that ''P'' and ''Q'' is necessary for the other, &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q \land Q \Rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;, which can also be stated as each ''is sufficient for'' or ''implies'' the other.

One may summarize any, and thus all, of these cases by the statement "''P'' [[if and only if]] ''Q''", which is denoted by &lt;math&gt;P \Leftrightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;, whereas cases tell us that &lt;math&gt;P \Leftrightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is identical to &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q \land Q \Rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, in [[graph theory]] a graph ''G'' is called [[Bipartite graph|bipartite]] if it is possible to assign to each of its vertices the color ''black'' or ''white'' in such a way that every edge of ''G'' has one endpoint of each color.  And for any graph to be bipartite, it is a necessary and sufficient condition that it contain no odd-length [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]].  Thus, discovering whether a graph has any odd cycles tells one whether it is bipartite and conversely.  A philosopher&lt;ref name="stan"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-intensional/ Stanford University primer, 2006].&lt;/ref&gt; might characterize this state of affairs thus: "Although the concepts of bipartiteness and absence of odd cycles differ in [[intension]], they have identical [[extension (semantics)|extension]].&lt;ref&gt;"Meanings, in this sense, are often called ''intensions'', and things designated, ''extensions''. Contexts in which extension is all that matters are, naturally, called ''extensional'', while contexts in which extension is not enough are ''intensional''. Mathematics is typically extensional throughout." [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-intensional/ Stanford University primer, 2006].&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, theorems are often stated in the form "''P'' is true if and only if ''Q'' is true". Their proofs normally first prove sufficiency, e.g. &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;. Secondly, the opposite is proven, &lt;math&gt;Q \Rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;
# either directly, assuming ''Q'' is true and demonstrating that the Q circle is located within P, or 
# [[Proof by contrapositive|contrapositively]], that is demonstrating that stepping outside circle of P, we fall out the ''Q'': ''assuming not P, not Q results''.

This proves that the circles for Q and P match on the Venn diagrams above.

Because, as explained in previous section, necessity of one for the other is equivalent to sufficiency of the other for the first one, e.g. &lt;math&gt;P \Leftarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; is [[Logical equivalence|equivalent to]] &lt;math&gt;Q \Rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;, if ''P'' is necessary and sufficient for ''Q'', then ''Q'' is necessary and sufficient for ''P''. We can write &lt;math&gt;P \Leftrightarrow Q \equiv Q \Leftrightarrow P&lt;/math&gt; and say that the statements "''P'' is true [[if and only if]] ''Q'', is true" and "''Q'' is true if and only if ''P'' is true" are equivalent.

In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], a '''non-perturbative''' [[function (mathematics)|function]] or process is one that cannot be accurately described by [[perturbation theory]]. An example is the function

&lt;math&gt;f(x)=e^{-1/x^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:expinvsq.svg|frame|The function ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−1/''x''²&lt;/sup&gt;. The Taylor series is identically zero, but the function is not.]]

The [[Taylor series]] at x = 0  for this function is exactly zero to all orders in perturbation theory, but the function is non-zero if ''x'' ≠ 0.

The implication of this for physics is that there are some phenomena which are impossible to understand by perturbation theory, regardless of how many orders of perturbation theory we use. [[Instanton]]s are an example.

Therefore, in [[theoretical physics]], a '''non-perturbative''' solution or theory is one that does not require perturbation theory to explicate, or does not simply describe the dynamics of perturbations around some fixed background.  For this reason, non-perturbative solutions and theories yield insights into areas and subjects perturbative methods cannot reveal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11414">The '''Polymath Project''' is a collaboration among [[mathematician]]s to solve important and difficult [[Mathematics|mathematical]] problems by coordinating many mathematicians to communicate with each other on finding the best route to the solution. The project began in January 2009 on [[Timothy Gowers]]' blog when he posted a problem and asked his readers to post partial ideas and partial progress toward a solution.&lt;ref name="reinventing" /&gt; This experiment resulted in a new answer to a difficult problem, and since then the Polymath Project has grown to describe a particular process of using an online collaboration to solve any math problem.

==Origin==
In January 2009, Gowers chose to start a [[social experiment]] on his [[blog]] by choosing an important unsolved mathematical problem and issuing an invitation for other people to help solve it collaboratively in the comments section of his blog.&lt;ref name="reinventing"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nielsen|first=Michael|title=[[Reinventing discovery : the new era of networked science]]|year=2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton NJ|isbn=978-0-691-14890-8|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the math problem itself, Gowers asked a question which was included in the title of his blog post, "is massively collaborative mathematics possible?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gowers|first=Tim|title=Is massively collaborative mathematics possible?|url=http://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/is-massively-collaborative-mathematics-possible/|work=Gowers' weblog|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gowers | first1 = T. | last2 = Nielsen | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1038/461879a | title = Massively collaborative mathematics | journal = Nature | volume = 461 | issue = 7266 | pages = 879–881 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19829354 | pmc = |bibcode = 2009Natur.461..879G }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This post led to his creation of the Polymath Project.

==Projects for high school and college==
Since its inception, it has now sponsored a "[https://artofproblemsolving.com/polymath Crowdmath]" project in collaboration with [[MIT PRIMES]] program and the [[Art of Problem Solving]]. This project is built upon the same idea of the Polymath project that massive collaboration in mathematics is possible and possibly quite fruitful. However, this is specifically aimed at only high school and college students with a goal of creating "a specific opportunity for the upcoming generation of math and science researchers." The problems are original research and unsolved problems in mathematics. All high school and college students from around the world with advanced background of mathematics are encouraged to participate. Older participants are welcomed to participate as mentors and encouraged not to post solutions to the problems. The first Crowdmath project began on March 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Crowdmath" project for high school students opens on March 1|url=http://polymathprojects.org/2016/01/02/crowdmath-project-for-high-school-students-opens-on-march-1/|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CROWDMATH|url=http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/polymath/mitprimes2016/f/c195578h1177036_welcome_to_crowdmath|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial proposed problem for this project, now called Polymath1 by the Polymath community, was to find a new combinatorial proof to the density version of the [[Hales–Jewett theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gowers |first=Tim |title=A combinatorial approach to density Hales-Jewett |date=1 February 2009 |work=Gower's Weblog |url=http://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/02/01/a-combinatorial-approach-to-density-hales-jewett/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the project took form, two main threads of discourse emerged. The first thread, which was carried out in the comments of Gowers's blog, would continue with the original goal of finding a combinatorial proof.  The second thread, which was carried out in the comments of [[Terence Tao]]'s blog, focused on calculating bounds on density of [[Hales-Jewett number]]s and [[Moser number]]s for low dimensions.

After seven weeks, Gowers announced on his blog that the problem was "probably solved",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/?p=584|title=The Polymath project: scope of participation|last=Nielsen|first=Michael|date=2009-03-20|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; though work would continue on both Gowers's thread and Tao's thread well into May 2009, some three months after the initial announcement.  In total over 40 people contributed to the Polymath1 project. Both threads of the Polymath1 project have been successful, producing at least two new papers to be published under the [[pseudonym]] '''D.H.J. Polymath''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1009.3956|author1=Polymath|title=Deterministic methods to find primes|class=math.NT|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1002.0374|author1=Polymath|title=Density Hales-Jewett and Moser numbers|class=math.CO|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=0910.3926|author1=Polymath|title=A new proof of the density Hales-Jewett theorem|class=math.CO|year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the initials refer to the problem itself ('''d'''ensity '''H'''ales-'''J'''ewett).

===Polymath5===
This project was set up in order to try to solve the [[Erdős discrepancy problem]]. It was active for much of 2010 and had a brief revival in 2012, but did not end up solving the problem. However, in September 2015, [[Terence Tao]], one of the participants of Polymath5, solved the problem in a pair of papers. One paper proved an averaged form of the Chowla and Elliott conjectures, making use of recent advances in analytic number theory concerning correlations of values of multiplicative functions. The other paper showed how this new result, combined with some arguments discovered by Polymath5, were enough to give a complete solution to the problem. Thus, Polymath5 ended up making a significant contribution to the solution.

===Polymath8===
The Polymath8 project&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelnielsen.org/polymath1/index.php?title=Bounded_gaps_between_primes Polymath8 project].&lt;/ref&gt; was proposed to improve the bounds for small gaps between primes. It has two components:

* Polymath8a, "Bounded gaps between primes", was a project to improve the bound H=H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the least gap between consecutive primes that was attained infinitely often, by developing the techniques of [[Yitang Zhang]]. This project concluded with a bound of H = 4,680.
* Polymath8b, "Bounded intervals with many primes", was a project to improve the value of H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; further, as well as H&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; (the least gap between primes with m-1 primes between them that is attained infinitely often), by combining the Polymath8a results with the techniques of [[James Maynard (mathematician)|James Maynard]]. This project concluded with a bound of H=246, as well as additional bounds on H&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.

Both components of the Polymath8 project have been successful, producing two new papers, one of which was published under the pseudonym '''D.H.J. Polymath'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Polymath|doi=10.2140/ant.2014.8.2067|title=New equidistribution estimates of Zhang type|year=2014|volume=8|journal=Algebra &amp; Number Theory|pages=2067–2199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Polymath|title=Variants of the Selberg sieve, and bounded intervals containing many primes|doi=10.1186/s40687-014-0012-7|year=2014|volume=1|journal=Research in the Mathematical Sciences|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|A philosophical theory of mathematics}}{{Postmodernism}}

'''Postmodern mathematics''' is a thought developed as a result of postmodernism. The theory asserts that there is no such thing as ‘absolutism’ or ultimate truth in mathematics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moslehian|first=M. S.|date=November 2005|title=Postmodern view of humanistic mathematics|journal=Resonance|language=en|volume=10|issue=11|pages=98–105|doi=10.1007/bf02837651|issn=0971-8044}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also declares that the term ‘mathematics’ can’t be used to define a specific object.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This thought emerged from the post modernistic idea of the relativity of truth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; The thought also maintains that the ideas in mathematics are subjective and that there is no ‘right’ answer to a mathematical question.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Ideas ==
The ideas affirmed in Postmodern Mathematics can be summed up as follows:

=== Plurality ===
The term 'Mathematics', in its singular form, cannot be used to describe any object.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite conference|last=Ernest|first=Paul|date=2015|pages=605–608|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-12688-3_68|isbn=9783319106854|book-title=The Proceedings of the 12th International Congress on Mathematical Education|title=Postmodern Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, mathematics, in its plural form, describes the multiplicity of this term based on the context it is used in. All these various definitions are not necessarily true or false and can be right or wrong based on the context they are defined in.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Rejection of 'universality' and 'absolutism' ===
Postmodernism rejects the idea of universality in mathematics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It claims that there is no such thing as 'absolutism' and asserts the notion of multiplicity in mathematics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This comes from the postmodernist idea that rejects notions of absolutism and the claim that the knowledge we attain as ‘true’ is only a representation constructed by society which is not truer than any other representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Postmodernists also reject the absolutist idea of mathematics being “human free” and objective and instead assert a “humanistic” view of mathematics which is filled with subjective and humane values.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52100009|title=The philosophy of mathematics education|last=Paul.|first=Ernest,|date=1991|publisher=Falmer Press|isbn=020322423X|location=London|oclc=52100009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view sees mathematics as: &lt;blockquote&gt;imbued with moral and social values which play a significant role in the development and applications of mathematics.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Rejection of certainty ===
Certainty in mathematics is not attainable. The answers proposed are perceived as probabilities and not certainties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Postmodernism in mathematics oppose Aristotelian and modernist concept of an object being either true or false and instead asserts the concept of a “degree of truth”. Thus, proclaiming the notion of partial truths and uncertainty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to the Postmodernist thought, theories in mathematics accepted as 'true' and 'certain' are products of society as the criteria for 'certainty' and 'truth' are socially constructed. Therefore, postmodernism rejects the notion of certainty and absolute truth in mathematics as certainties in mathematics are not static and can change throughout time and societies.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This is significant as mathematics is usually perceived as the "most certain part of human knowledge", questioning the certainty of this part of knowledge thus rejects certainty from any form of human knowledge.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Fallibility in mathematics ===
Mathematics is a corrigible discipline as it is subject to the notion of fallibility and is in a state of constant change.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ernest|first=Paul|last2=Izmirli|first2=Ilhan|date=2011|title=Does a Postmodernist Philosophy of Mathematics Make Sense? Is "2 + 2 = 5" Correct as Long as One's Personal Situation or Perspective Requires It?|url=http://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/education/research/centres/stem/publications/pmej/|journal=Philosophy of Mathematics Education Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was first proposed by Lakatos in his book "Proofs and Refutation". It also constitutes the hypothetical-deductive system of mathematics which declares that the discipline of mathematics is fallible and corrigible, the development of theorems require the falsification of “falsifiers” and transmission to hypothetical knowledge. In other words, in order to develop theorems, one must first falsify the premises under which the theorem would be falsified.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This would further constitute that mathematics is connected as a part of the broad human knowledge, including the culture, language and perspectives.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Social [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivism]] in mathematics ===
As theories and laws proclaimed in mathematics are representations made by the society, mathematics is constructed by the needs of societies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hence, holds no other value other than being representations of cultures and societies.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== History ==
Postmodernism was a movement that started against modernism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Modernism values the faith in the existence of an objective and universal truth.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peck|first=Frederick|last2=Sriraman|first2=Bharath|date=2017-06-15|title=Breaking the Constraints of Modernist Psychologizing: Mathematics Education Flirts with the Postmodern|journal=Interchange|language=en|volume=48|issue=4|pages=351–362|doi=10.1007/s10780-017-9306-1|issn=0826-4805}}&lt;/ref&gt; For modernists, knowledge is the use of empirical methodologies in order to discover the ‘ultimate truth’. Postmodernism counters that knowledge isn’t as empirical and logical as modernism persists, rather it is subjective and is open to change.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ernest|first=Paul|date=1997|title=Chapter 3: The Epistemological Basis of Qualitative Research in Mathematics Education: A Postmodern Perspective|journal=Journal for Research in Mathematics Education. Monograph|volume=9|pages=22–177|doi=10.2307/749945|jstor=749945}}&lt;/ref&gt; For postmodernists, knowledge is a construct of the society and is subject to change over time and place.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In mathematics, modernism asserts notions of [[Platonism]] (the view that theories in mathematics are unchangeable and perceives mathematics as perfect and eternal),&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moslehian|first=Mohammad|date=2003|title=A glance at Postmodern pedagogy of mathematics|url=|journal=Philosophy of Mathematics Education Journal|volume=17|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Logicism]] (the view that perceives mathematics as a part of Logic)&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; and [[Formalism (philosophy of mathematics)|Formalism]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These concepts were accepted universally before the introduction of postmodernism. This change in thoughts brought about by the introduction of postmodernism caused a shift of mathematics research and practice from “logical theories” and challenged the notion of objectivity, universality and certainty in mathematics.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Unlike modernist ideas of singularity, postmodernism denotes the idea of plurality and polycentrism.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Postmodernism also promotes the idea of collaboration between the teachers and students of mathematics as it argues for the idea of everyone being an explorer of mathematics.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/education/research/centres/stem/publications/pmej/pome18/tarp_modern_and_poMo_critical_research.htm|title=Modern and Postmodern Critical Research|last=Tarp|first=Allan|date=2018|website=socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modernism, on the other hand, propose no question for the nature of mathematics or education as they contend that the two entities are not related to one another.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In this thought, students in search of education, mathematics in this context, are exploring an “independent world”. This independent world remains unhinged by the student’s exploration and is not changed by the students’ encounter as they are two separate entities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Postmodernism, on the other hand, encourages the transformation of knowledge by the student as they believe that the two only exist “relative to one another”.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Notable figures ==
=== [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] ===
Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) developed a notion against the modernist idea of rationality and claimed that it is isn’t as evident and clear as perceived by modernists.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He claimed that certainty in mathematics is “a collection of language games” and truth and false are based on the their following of “the rules of linguistic games”.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;It is what human beings say that is true and false: and they agree in the language they use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49055907|title=Philosophical investigations : the German text, with a revised English translation|last=1889-1951.|first=Wittgenstein, Ludwig,|date=2001|publisher=Blackwell|others=Anscombe, G. E. M. (Gertrude Elizabeth Margaret)|year=|isbn=0631231277|edition= 3rd|location=Oxford|pages=88|oclc=49055907}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===[[Karl Popper]]===

Karl Popper (1902-1994) introduced the notion of falsification and asserted that to prove theories in sciences, researchers should strive to disprove them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He also asserted that the laws in mathematics are subject to being proven false and hence rejected the idea of ultimate truths.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Citation|title=Karl Popper|date=2018-10-01|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Karl_Popper&amp;oldid=862051499|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Imre Lakatos]] ===
[[File:Professor Imre Lakatos, c1960s (4111988460).jpg|thumb|209x209px|Imre Lakatos, Professor of Mathematics and author of ''Proofs and Refutations'']]
Imre Lakatos (1922-1974) was inspired by Karl Popper's idea of falsification in mathematics and wrote his thesis on the fallibility of mathematics and mathematical theorems.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In his book, titled ‘Proofs and refutations’, Lakatos claimed that all the theorems in mathematics are fallible and the theories that are accepted as ‘true’ or ‘perfect’ are only accepted because there hasn’t been any theorem that counters them.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Citation|title=Imre Lakatos|date=2018-10-07|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Imre_Lakatos&amp;oldid=862877140|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that theories in mathematics have no basis for certainty as they are products of assumptions made by humans and are  hence refutable.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===[[Paul Ernest]]===
Paul Ernest has extensive works on the philosophy of mathematics where he draws upon the works of other postmodern philosophers including Popper and Lakatos.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Citation|title=Paul Ernest|date=2018-10-12|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Ernest&amp;oldid=863756053|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works mainly reflect his belief in the social constructivism of mathematics which illustrates that mathematical theories are a construct of the society and are thus changeable.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; He also published the "Philosophy of Mathematics Education Journal" which contributes to discussions of the philosophy of mathematics and mathematics education and has extensive articles on postmodern mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ernest|first=Paul|date=|title=Philosophy of Mathematics Education Journal|url=http://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/education/research/centres/stem/publications/pmej/|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wilkinson ===
He introduced the idea of 'fuzzy logic'. This idea rejects the Aristotelian Law of Truth and fallibility of an object (the notion that an object is either true or false). He instead proposed the existence of 'degrees of truth', the idea that an object is characterised into various degrees of truth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== [[Thomas Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn:]] ===
Thomas Kuhn (1922-1996) introduced the idea of paradigm shifts in sciences. he asserted that the paradigms and theories in sciences are not fixed but are instead on a continuum and hence are subject to transformations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Thomas Kuhn|date=2018-08-26|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Kuhn&amp;oldid=856611375|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes his theory of paradigms as: &lt;blockquote&gt;''.. each paradigm will be shown to satisfy more or less the criteria that it dictates for itself and to fall short of a few of those dictated by its opponent. .. no paradigm ever solves all the problems it defines ..'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The structure of scientific revolutions|last=S.|first=Kuhn, Thomas|date=1970|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226458038|edition= Second, enlarged|location=Chicago|oclc=93075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to Kuhn, education and knowledge strives to interpret and represent rather than provide an objective explanation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These representations are examples of social constructivism and are products of societies throughout time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Postmodern mathematics in education ==
In the postmodernist view, mathematics is learnt not for knowledge but for utility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to this thought, teachers are not only an ‘authoritative figure’ but are also co-explorers and learners of mathematics&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; or as described by Ernest, “ringmasters of the mathematics circus”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They also assert on the role of students in the teaching mathematics and their role in the shaping of curriculum.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Postmodern mathematics asserts the diminishing of the notion of objectivity and absolutism in mathematics thus asserting that a “notion of 2 + 2 = 1” can be true given certain subjective circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Declining Standards at Michigan Public Universities. How Changes in Curricula and Teaching Affect Academic Achievement, Career Preparation, and K-12 Education.|last=Bertonneau|first=Thomas|publisher=Mackinac Center for Public Policy.|year=1997|isbn=978-0-9647703-9-3|edition= Second|location=|pages=56–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it doesn’t mean that the notion can be used based on any ‘personal situation’ rather it is relative to the mathematical context and situation it is used in such that 2 +2 = 1 is true in mod (3) arithmetic but it would never be true in any other mathematical context.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hence, mathematical theories are corrigible based on the mathematical contexts they are used in.

Unlike the modernist idea of teachers being the authoritative figure and “echo-phrasing” the textbooks, postmodernism encourages collaborative work between the students and the teachers which again relates to the notion of ‘truth’ and ‘knowledge’ being subjective.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This would also emphasise the notion that students should be given the opportunity to exercise alternate methods and solutions to the ones determined by the teachers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

If mathematics education is reshaped according to the postmodernist thought, it opens up windows for the implementation of mathematics by the students to their everyday life, culture and language. It enables them to reshape their knowledge of mathematics and concepts of mathematics.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mathematics becomes responsible for its uses and consequences, in education and society. Those of us in education have a special reason for wanting this more human view of mathematics. Anything else alienates and dis-empowers learners.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Postmodern education also encourages the use of technology and computers in the discovery of new ideas in mathematics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although these ideas are subject to uncertainty as denoted by postmodernism, they can still have the same or higher ‘degree of truth’ as those proven and discovered by classical methods.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The rejection of uncertainty also asserts researchers of mathematics and other knowledge to strive to achieve a higher degree of truth for human knowledge and hence encourages further research and study. This in turn expands the human knowledge vastly.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Postmodern education encourages teachers, students and researchers of mathematics to focus on criticism of the known mathematical facts rather than evaluation.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It asserts that mathematicians should focus not on what ‘mathematics’ is but rather what it could be and what it might be. It encourages constant criticism of the mathematical theories and trying to disprove the theories in order to get a higher degree of truth in mathematics education.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard]] describes this as &lt;blockquote&gt;Reality (certainty in this context) is not expressed by a phrase like X is such but by one like X is such and not such.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/17621488|title=The differend : phrases in dispute|last=1924-1998.|first=Lyotard, Jean-François,|date=1988|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=|isbn=0816616116|location=Minneapolis|pages=48|oclc=17621488}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He also claims that to prove the ‘reality’ or the ‘truth’ of a description of an entity, which in this context would be mathematics, the negation of another description is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rømer|first=Thomas|date=2005-05-25|title=LEARNING AND ASSESSMENT IN POSTMODERN EDUCATION|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1741-5446.2003.00313.x|journal=Educational Theory|volume=53|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2341">A '''quasi-triangular quasi-Hopf algebra''' is a specialized form of a [[quasi-Hopf algebra]] defined by the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] mathematician [[Vladimir Drinfeld]] in 1989. It is also a generalized form of a [[quasi-triangular Hopf algebra]].

A '''quasi-triangular quasi-Hopf algebra''' is a set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H_A} = (\mathcal{A}, R, \Delta, \varepsilon, \Phi) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B_A} = (\mathcal{A}, \Delta, \varepsilon, \Phi)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[quasi-Hopf algebra]] and &lt;math&gt;R \in \mathcal{A \otimes A} &lt;/math&gt; known as the R-matrix, is an invertible element such that 

:&lt;math&gt; R \Delta(a) = \sigma \circ \Delta(a) R, a \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma: \mathcal{A \otimes A} \rightarrow \mathcal{A \otimes A} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x \otimes y \rightarrow y \otimes x &lt;/math&gt;

so that &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; is the switch map and

:&lt;math&gt; (\Delta \otimes \operatorname{id})R = \Phi_{321}R_{13}\Phi_{132}^{-1}R_{23}\Phi_{123} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; (\operatorname{id} \otimes \Delta)R = \Phi_{231}^{-1}R_{13}\Phi_{213}R_{12}\Phi_{123}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{abc} = x_a \otimes x_b \otimes x_c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Phi_{123}= \Phi = x_1 \otimes x_2 \otimes x_3 \in \mathcal{A \otimes A \otimes A}&lt;/math&gt;.

The quasi-Hopf algebra becomes ''triangular'' if in addition, &lt;math&gt;R_{21}R_{12}=1&lt;/math&gt;.

The twisting of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H_A}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;F \in \mathcal{A \otimes A}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as for a quasi-Hopf algebra, with the additional definition of the twisted ''R''-matrix

A quasi-triangular (resp. triangular) quasi-Hopf algebra with &lt;math&gt; \Phi=1&lt;/math&gt; is a [[quasi-triangular Hopf algebra|quasi-triangular (resp. triangular) Hopf algebra]] as the latter two conditions in the definition reduce the conditions of quasi-triangularity of a Hopf algebra.

Similarly to the [[quasi-bialgebra#Twisting|twisting]] properties of the [[quasi-Hopf algebra]], the property of being quasi-triangular or triangular quasi-Hopf algebra is preserved by twisting.

The '''quasispecies model''' is a description of the process of the Darwinian [[evolution]] of certain [[self-replication|self-replicating]] entities within the framework of [[physical chemistry]]. A quasispecies is a large group or "'''cloud'''" of related [[genotype]]s that exist in an environment of high mutation rate (at stationary state&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eigen|first=Manfred|last2=McCaskill|first2=John|last3=Schuster|first3=Peter|title=Molecular quasi-species|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/j100335a010|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry|language=en|volume=92|issue=24|pages=6881–6891|doi=10.1021/j100335a010|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-002C-84A7-C}}&lt;/ref&gt;), where a large fraction of offspring are expected to contain one or more mutations relative to the parent.  This is in contrast to a [[species]], which from an evolutionary perspective is a more-or-less stable single genotype, most of the offspring of which will be genetically accurate copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Biebricher, C.K &amp; Eigen, M.|chapter=What is a Quasispecies|editor=Esteban Domingo|title=Quasispecies: Concept and Implications for Virology |publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=978-3-540-26395-1|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is useful mainly in providing a qualitative understanding of the evolutionary processes of self-replicating macromolecules such as [[RNA]] or [[DNA]] or simple asexual organisms such as [[bacterium|bacteria]] or [[virus]]es (see also [[viral quasispecies]]), and is helpful in explaining something of the early stages of the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]]. Quantitative predictions based on this model are difficult because the parameters that serve as its input are impossible to obtain from actual biological systems. The quasispecies model was put forward by [[Manfred Eigen]] and [[Peter Schuster]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Eigen M, Schuster P |year=1979 |title=The Hypercycle: A Principle of Natural Self-Organization |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin |isbn=0-387-09293-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on initial work done by Eigen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eigen |first=Manfred |date=October 1971 |title=Selforganization of matter and the evolution of biological macromolecules |journal=Die Naturwissenschaften |volume=58 |issue=10 |pages=465–523 |doi=10.1007/BF00623322 |pmid=4942363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simplified explanation==

When evolutionary biologists describe competition between species, they generally assume that each species is a single genotype whose descendants are mostly accurate copies.  (Such genotypes are said to have a high reproductive ''fidelity''.)  Evolutionarily, we are interested in the behavior and fitness of that one species or genotype over time.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Some organisms or genotypes, however, may exist in circumstances of low fidelity, where most descendants contain one or more mutations.  A group of such genotypes is constantly changing, so discussions of which single genotype is the most fit become meaningless.  Importantly, if many closely related genotypes are only one mutation away from each other, then genotypes in the group can mutate back and forth into each other.  For example, with one mutation per generation, a child of the sequence AGGT could be AGTT, and a grandchild could be AGGT again.  Thus we can envision a "'''cloud'''" of related genotypes that is rapidly mutating, with sequences going back and forth among different points in the cloud.  Though the proper definition is mathematical, that cloud, roughly speaking, is a quasispecies.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Quasispecies behavior exists for large numbers of individuals existing at a certain (high) range of mutation rates.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez, MA, Martus G, Capel E, Parera M, Franco S, Nevot M (2012) Quasispecies Dynamics of RNA Viruses. In: Viruses: Essential Agents of Life, Springer, Dordrecht, pp. 21-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quasispecies, fitness, and evolutionary selection===
In a species, though reproduction may be mostly accurate, periodic mutations will give rise to one or more competing genotypes.  If a mutation results in greater replication and survival, the mutant genotype may out-compete the parent genotype and come to dominate the species.  Thus, the individual genotypes (or species) may be seen as the units on which selection acts and biologists will often speak of a single genotype's [[fitness (biology)|fitness]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In a quasispecies, however, mutations are ubiquitous and so the fitness of an individual genotype becomes meaningless: if one particular mutation generates a boost in reproductive success, it can't amount to much because that genotype's offspring are unlikely to be accurate copies with the same properties.  Instead, what matters is the ''connectedness'' of the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Villarreal | first1 = L.P. | last2 = Witzany | first2 = G. | year = 2013 | title = Rethinking quasispecies theory: From fittest type to cooperative consortia | journal = World Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 70–79 | doi = 10.4331/wjbc.v4.i4.79 | pmid = 24340131 | pmc=3856310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the sequence AGGT has 12 (3+3+3+3) possible single point mutants AGGA, AGGG, and so on.  If 10 of those mutants are viable genotypes that may reproduce (and some of whose offspring or grandchildren may mutate back into AGGT again), we would consider that sequence a well-connected node in the cloud.  If instead only two of those mutants are viable, the rest being lethal mutations, then that sequence is poorly connected and most of its descendants will not reproduce. The analog of fitness for a quasispecies is the tendency of nearby relatives within the cloud to be well-connected, meaning that more of the mutant descendants will be viable and give rise to further descendants within the cloud.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

When the fitness of a single genotype becomes meaningless because of the high rate of mutations, the cloud as a whole or quasispecies becomes the natural unit of selection.

===Application to biological research===

Quasispecies represents the evolution of high-mutation-rate viruses such as [[HIV]] and sometimes single genes or molecules within the genomes of other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holland |last2=et. al. |year= |title=RNA virus populations as quasispecies |journal=Genetic Diversity of RNA Viruses}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Domingo |first1=E. |year=2002 |title=Quasispecies theory in virology |journal=Journal of Virology |volume=76 |pages=463–465 |doi= 10.1128/jvi.76.1.463-465.2002|url=http://jvi.asm.org/content/76/1/463.full|pmc=135734 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilke |year=2005 |title=Quasispecies theory in the context of population genetics |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=5 |pages=44 |doi=10.1186/1471-2148-5-44 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/44|pmc=1208876 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quasispecies models have also been proposed by Jose Fontanari and [[Emmanuel David Tannenbaum]] to model the evolution of sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tannenbaum ED, Fontanari JF |year=2008 |title=A quasispecies approach to the evolution of sexual replication in unicellular organisms |journal=Theory Bioscience |volume=127 |pages=53–65 |doi=10.1007/s12064-008-0023-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quasispecies was also shown in compositional replicators (based on the [[Gard model]] for [[abiogenesis]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gross |first1=R. |last2=Fouxon |first2=I. |last3=Lancet |first3=D. |last4=Markovitch |first4=O. |year=2014 |title=Quasispecies in population of compositional assemblies |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=14 |pages=2623 |doi=10.1186/s12862-014-0265-1 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/14/2623/abstract |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102125325/http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/14/2623/abstract |archivedate=January 2, 2015 |pmid=25547629 |pmc=4357159}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also suggested to be applicable to describe cell's replication, which amongst other things requires the maintenance and evolution of the internal composition of the parent and bud.

==Formal background==

The model rests on four assumptions{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}:
# The self-replicating entities can be represented as sequences composed of a small number of building blocks—for example, sequences of RNA consisting of the four bases [[adenine]], [[guanine]], [[cytosine]], and [[uracil]].
# New sequences enter the system solely as the result of a copy process, either correct or erroneous, of other sequences that are already present.
# The substrates, or raw materials, necessary for ongoing replication are always present in sufficient quantity. Excess sequences are washed away in an outgoing flux.
# Sequences may decay into their building blocks. The probability of decay does not depend on the sequences' age; old sequences are just as likely to decay as young sequences.

In the quasispecies model, [[mutation]]s occur through errors made in the process of copying already existing sequences. Further, [[natural selection|selection]] arises because different types of sequences tend to replicate at different rates, which leads to the suppression of sequences that replicate more slowly in favor of sequences that replicate faster. However, the quasispecies model does not predict the ultimate extinction of all but the fastest replicating sequence. Although the sequences that replicate more slowly cannot sustain their abundance level by themselves, they are constantly replenished as sequences that replicate faster mutate into them. At equilibrium, removal of slowly replicating sequences due to decay or outflow is balanced by replenishing, so that even relatively slowly replicating sequences can remain present in finite abundance.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Due to the ongoing production of mutant sequences, selection does not act on single sequences, but on mutational "clouds" of closely related sequences, referred to as ''quasispecies''. In other words, the evolutionary success of a particular sequence depends not only on its own replication rate, but also on the replication rates of the mutant sequences it produces, and on the replication rates of the sequences of which it is a mutant. As a consequence, the sequence that replicates fastest may even disappear completely in selection-mutation equilibrium, in favor of more slowly replicating sequences that are part of a quasispecies with a higher average growth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schuster P, Swetina J |date=November 1988 |title=Stationary mutant distributions and evolutionary optimization |journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biology |volume=50 |issue=6  |pages=635–660 |issn=0092-8240 |doi=10.1007/BF02460094 |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |location=Dordrecht |pmid=3219448}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mutational clouds as predicted by the quasispecies model have been observed in RNA viruses and in ''in vitro'' RNA replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Domingo E, Holland JJ |date=October 1997 |title=RNA virus mutations and fitness for survival |journal=Annual Review of Microbiology |volume=51 |pages=151–178  |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.51.1.151 |pmid=9343347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Burch CL, Chao L |year=2000 |title=Evolvability of an RNA virus is determined by its mutational neighbourhood |journal=Nature |volume=406 |pages=625–628 |doi=10.1038/35020564 |pmid=10949302 |issue=6796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mutation rate and the general fitness of the molecular sequences and their neighbors is crucial to the formation of a quasispecies. If the mutation rate is zero, there is no exchange by mutation, and each sequence is its own species. If the mutation rate is too high, exceeding what is known as the [[Error threshold (evolution)|error threshold]], the quasispecies will break down and be dispersed over the entire range of available sequences.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Mathematical description==

A simple mathematical model for a quasispecies is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eigen|first=Manfred|last2=McCaskill|first2=John|last3=Schuster|first3=Peter|title=Molecular quasi-species|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/j100335a010|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry|language=en|volume=92|issue=24|pages=6881–6891|doi=10.1021/j100335a010|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-002C-84A7-C}}&lt;/ref&gt; let there be  &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;  possible sequences and let there be &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; organisms with sequence ''i''. Let's say that each of these organisms asexually gives rise to &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; offspring. Some are duplicates of their parent, having sequence ''i'', but some are mutant and have some other sequence. Let the mutation rate &lt;math&gt;q_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; correspond to the [[probability]] that a ''j'' type parent will produce an ''i'' type organism. Then the [[Expected value|expected]] fraction of offspring generated by ''j'' type organisms that would be ''i'' type organisms is &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}=A_j q_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\sum_i q_{ij}=1&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the total number of ''i''-type organisms after the first round of reproduction, given as &lt;math&gt;n'_i&lt;/math&gt;, is

:&lt;math&gt;n'_i=\sum_j w_{ij}n_j&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes a death rate term &lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt; is included so that:

:&lt;math&gt;w_{ij}=A_j q_{ij}-D_i\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to 1 when i=j and is zero otherwise. Note that the ''n-th'' generation can be found by just taking the ''n-th'' power of '''W''' substituting it in place of '''W''' in the above formula.

This is just a [[system of linear equations]]. The usual way to solve such a system is to first [[Diagonalizable matrix|diagonalize]] the '''W''' matrix. Its diagonal entries will be [[eigenvalues]] corresponding to certain linear combinations of certain subsets of sequences which will be [[eigenvectors]] of the '''W''' matrix. These subsets of sequences are the quasispecies.  Assuming that the matrix '''W''' is a [[primitive matrix]] ([[Irreducibility (mathematics)|irreducible]] and [[Perron–Frobenius theorem|aperiodic]]), then after very many generations only the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue will prevail, and it is this quasispecies that will eventually dominate. The components of this eigenvector give the relative abundance of each sequence at equilibrium.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

=== Note about primitive matrices ===

'''W''' being primitive means that for some integer &lt;math&gt; n &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, that the &lt;math&gt;n^{th} &lt;/math&gt; power of '''W''' is &gt; 0, i.e. all the entries are positive.  If '''W''' is primitive then each type can, through a sequence of mutations (i.e. powers of '''W''') mutate into all the other types after some number of generations. '''W''' is not primitive if it is periodic, where the population can perpetually cycle through different disjoint sets of compositions, or if it is reducible, where the dominant species (or quasispecies) that develops can depend on the initial population, as is the case in the simple example given below.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Alternative formulations===

The quasispecies formulae may be expressed as a set of linear differential equations. If we consider the difference between the new state &lt;math&gt;n'_i&lt;/math&gt; and the old state &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; to be the state change over one moment of time, then we can state that the time derivative of &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; is given by this difference,   &lt;math&gt;\dot{n}_i = n'_i-n_i&lt;/math&gt; we can write:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{n}_i=\sum_j w_{ij}n_j-n_i&lt;/math&gt;

The quasispecies equations are usually expressed in terms of concentrations &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; where

:&lt;math&gt;x_i\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{n_i}{\sum_j n_j}&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;x'_i\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{n'_i}{\sum_j n'_j}&lt;/math&gt;.

The above equations for the quasispecies then become for the discrete version:

:&lt;math&gt;x'_i = \frac{\sum_j w_{ij}x_j}{\sum_{ij} w_{ij}x_j}&lt;/math&gt;

or, for the continuum version:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_i =\sum_j w_{ij}x_j-x_i\sum_{ij}w_{ij}x_j.&lt;/math&gt;

===Simple example===
The quasispecies concept can be illustrated by a simple system consisting of 4 sequences. Sequences [0,0], [0,1], [1,0], and [1,1] are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Let's say the [0,0] sequence never mutates and always produces a single offspring. Let's say the other 3 sequences all produce, on average, &lt;math&gt;1-k&lt;/math&gt; replicas of themselves, and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of each of the other two types, where &lt;math&gt;0\le k\le 1&lt;/math&gt;. The '''W''' matrix is then:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{W}=
\begin{bmatrix}
1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;1-k&amp;k&amp;k\\
0&amp;k&amp;1-k&amp;k\\
0&amp;k&amp;k&amp;1-k
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;.

The diagonalized matrix is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{W'}=
\begin{bmatrix}
1-2k&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;1-2k&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1+k
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;.

And the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues are:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
![[Eigenvalue]] !! [[Eigenvector]]
|-
|1-2k || [0,-1,0,1]
|-
| 1-2k || [0,-1,1,0]
|-
| 1 || [1,0,0,0]
|-
| 1+k || [0,1,1,1]
|}

Only the eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;1+k&lt;/math&gt; is more than unity. For the n-th generation, the corresponding eigenvalue will be &lt;math&gt;(1+k)^n&lt;/math&gt; and so will increase without bound as time goes by. This eigenvalue corresponds to the eigenvector [0,1,1,1], which represents the quasispecies consisting of sequences 2, 3, and 4, which will be present in equal numbers after a very long time. Since all population numbers must be positive,  the first two quasispecies are not legitimate. The third quasispecies consists of only the non-mutating sequence 1. It's seen that even though sequence 1 is the most fit in the sense that it reproduces more of itself than any other sequence, the quasispecies consisting of the other three sequences will eventually dominate (assuming that the initial population was not homogeneous of the sequence 1 type).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11678">A [[scientific society]], the '''Quaternion Society''' was an "International Association for Promoting the Study of Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics". At its peak it consisted of about 60 mathematicians spread throughout the academic world that were experimenting with [[quaternion]]s and other [[hypercomplex number]] systems. The guiding light was [[Alexander Macfarlane]] who served as its Secretary initially, and became President in 1909. The Association published a ''Bibliography'' in 1904 and a ''Bulletin'' (annual report) from 1900 to 1913.

The ''Bulletin'' became a [[review journal]] for topics in [[vector analysis]] and [[abstract algebra]] such as the theory of [[equipollence (geometry)|equipollence]]. The mathematical work reviewed pertained largely to [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] and [[linear algebra]] as the methods were in rapid development at the time.
==Genesis==
In 1895, Professor P. Molenbroek of The Hague, Holland, and Shinkichi Kimura studying at Yale put out a call for scholars to form the society in widely circulated journals: [[Nature (journal)|Nature]],&lt;ref&gt;S. Kimura &amp; P. Molenbroek (1895) [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v52/n1353/pdf/052545a0.pdf Friends and Fellow Workers in Quaternions] [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 52:545–6 (#1353)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Science (journal)|Science]],&lt;ref&gt;S. Kimura &amp; P. Molenbroek (1895) ''To those Interested in Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics'' [[Science (journal)|Science]] 2nd Ser, 2:524&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;"Notes" [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] 2:53,&amp;nbsp;182; 5:317&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giuseppe Peano]] also announced the society formation in his ''Rivista di Matematica''. 

The call to form an Association was encouraged by Macfarlane in 1896:
:The logical harmony and unification of the whole of mathematical analysis ought to be kept in view. The algebra of space ought to include the algebra of the plane as a special case, just as the algebra of the plane includes the algebra of the line…When vector analysis is developed and presented...we may expect to see many zealous cultivators, many fruitful applications, and, finally, universal diffusion...May the movement initiated by Messrs. Molenbroek and Kimura hasten the realization of this happy result.&lt;ref&gt;A. Macfarlane (1896) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1624707 Quaternions] [[Science (journal)|Science]] (2) 3:99–100, link from [[Jstor]] early content&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897 the [[British Association]] met in [[Toronto]] where vector products were discussed:
:Professor [[Olaus Henrici|Henrici]] proposed a new notation to denote the different products of vectors, which consists in using square brackets for vector products and round brackets for scalar products. He likewise advocated adoption of Heaviside’s term "ort" for vector, the [[tensor of a quaternion|tensor]] of which is the number 1. Prof. A. Macfarlane read a communication on the solution of the cubic equation in which he explained how the two binomials in [[cubic function#Cardano’s method|Cardano’s formula]] may be treated as complex quantities, either circular or hyperbolic, all the roots of the cubic can then be deduced by a general method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v56/n1454/pdf/056461a0.pdf "Physics at the British Association"]  [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 56:461,2 (# 1454)&lt;/ref&gt;

A system of national secretaries was announced in the AMS Bulletin in 1899: [[Alexander MacAulay]] for Australasia, [[Victor Schlegel]] for Germany, Joly for Great Britain and Ireland, Giuseppe Peano for Italy, Kimura for Japan, [[Aleksandr Kotelnikov]] for Russia, [[F. Kraft]] for Switzerland, and [[Arthur Stafford Hathaway]] for the USA. For France the national secretary was Paul Genty, an engineer with the division of Ponts et Chaussees, and a quaternion collaborator with [[Charles-Ange Laisant]], author of ''Methode des Quaterniones'' (1881).

[[Victor Schlegel]] reported&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Schlegel]] (1899) "Internationaler Verein zur Beförderung des Studiums der Quaternionen und verwandter Systeme der Mathematik", [[Monatshefte für Mathematik]] 10(1):376&lt;/ref&gt; on the new institution in the [[Monatshefte für Mathematik]].

==Officers==
When the Society was organized in 1899, [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] was chosen as president, but he declined for reasons of poor health.

The first President was [[Robert Stawell Ball]] and [[Alexander Macfarlane]] served as Secretary and Treasurer. In 1905 [[Charles Jasper Joly]] took over as President and L. van Elfrinkhof as Treasurer while Macfarlane continued as Secretary. In 1909 Macfarlane became President, James Byrnie Shaw became Secretary, and van Elfrinkhof continued as Treasurer. The next year Macfarlane and Shaw continued in their posts while Macfarlane also absorbed the office of Treasurer. When Macfarlane died in 1913 after nearly completing the issue of the Bulletin, Shaw completed it and wound up the Association.

The rules state that the President had the power of veto.

==Bulletin==
The ''Bulletin of the Association Promoting the Study of Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics'' was issued nine times under the editorship of Alexander Macfarlane. Every issue listed the officers of the Association, governing council, rules, members, and a [[financial statement]] from the [[treasurer]]. Today [[HathiTrust]] provides access to these publications that are mainly of historical interest:
&lt;ref&gt;P.R. Girard (1984) "The Quaternion Group and Modern Physics", ''[[European Journal of Physics]]'' 5:25–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Crowe (1967) [[A History of Vector Analysis]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bibliography==
Published in 1904 at Dublin, cradle of quaternions, the 86 page ''Bibliography of Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics''&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Macfarlane]] (1904) [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;cc=math;view=toc;subview=short;idno=03030001 Bibliography of Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics], weblink from [[Cornell University]] ''Historical Math Monographs''.
*[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v69/n1800/pdf/069604a0.pdf Review:''Bibliography of Quaternions''] in ''Nature'' 69:604&lt;/ref&gt; cited some one thousand references. The publication set a professional standard; for instance the ''Manual of Quaternions'' (1905) of Joly has no bibliography beyond citation of Macfarlane.
Furthermore, in 1967 when M.J. Crowe published ''[[A History of Vector Analysis]]'', he wrote in the preface (page ix) :
:''Concerning bibliography''. No formal bibliographical section has been included with this book. ... the need for a bibliography is greatly diminished by the existence of a book that lists nearly all relevant primary documents published to about 1912, this is Alexander Macfarlane’s ''Bibliography'' ...

Every year more papers and books appeared that were of interest to Association members so it was necessary to update the ''Bibliography'' with supplements in the ''Bulletin''. The categories used to group the items in the supplements give a sense of the changing focus of the Association:
* [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000052363498;view=1up;seq=163 1905 Supplement]
* [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000052363498;view=1up;seq=194 1908 Supplement]: Matrices, Linear substitutions, Quadratic forms, Bilinear forms, Complex numbers, Equipollences, Vector analysis, Commutative algebras, Quaternions, Biquaternions, Linear associative algebras, General algebra and operations, Additional.
* [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000052363498;view=1up;seq=277 1909 Supplement]
* [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000052363498;view=1up;seq=306 1910 Supplement]: Matrices, Linear groups, Complex numbers &amp; equipollences, Vector analysis, Ausdehnungslehre, Quaternions, Linear associative algebras.
* [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000052363498;view=1up;seq=402 1912 Supplement]: Equipollences, Commutative systems, Space-analysis, Dyadic systems, Vector analysis, Quaternions.
* [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000052363498;view=1up;seq=494 1913 Supplement]: Commutative systems, Space analysis, Dyadic systems, Vector analysis, Other, Quaternions, Hypercomplex numbers, General algebra.

==Aftermath==

In 1913 Macfarlane died, and as related by [[Dirk Struik]], the Society "became a victim of the first World War".&lt;ref&gt;[[Dirk Struik]] (1967) ''A Concise History of Mathematics'', 3rd edition, page 172, [[Dover Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;

James Byrnie Shaw, the surviving officer, wrote 50 book notices for American mathematical publications.&lt;ref&gt;See author=Shaw, James Byrnie at [[Mathematical Reviews]]&lt;/ref&gt;
The final article review in the ''Bulletin'' was [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000052363498;view=1up;seq=490 The Wilson and Lewis Algebra of Four-Dimensional Space] written by J. B. Shaw. He summarizes,
:This algebra is applied to the representation of the Minkowski time-space world.  It enables all analytical work to be with reals, although the geometry becomes non-Euclidean.
The article reviewed was "The space-time manifold of relativity, the non-euclidean geometry of mechanics, and electromagnetics".&lt;ref&gt;E. B. Wilson &amp; G. N. Lewis (1912) Proceedings of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] 48: 389–507&lt;/ref&gt;
However, when the [[textbook]] ''The Theory of Relativity'' by [[Ludwik Silberstein]] in 1914 was made available as an English understanding of [[Minkowski space]], the algebra of [[biquaternion]]s was applied, but without references to the British background or Macfarlane or other quaternionists of the Society. The language of quaternions had become international, providing content to [[set theory]] and expanded [[mathematical notation]], and expressing [[mathematical physics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22565">In [[classical mechanics]], the '''shell theorem''' gives gravitational simplifications that can be applied to objects inside or outside a spherically [[symmetry|symmetrical]] body. This theorem has particular application to [[astronomy]].

[[Isaac Newton]] proved the shell theorem&lt;ref name="Newton philo"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Isaac|title=Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|date=1687|location=London|pages=Theorem XXXI}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that:
# A [[sphere|spherically]] [[symmetry|symmetric]] body affects external objects gravitationally as though all of its [[mass]] were concentrated at a [[point mass|point]] at its centre.
# If the body is a spherically symmetric shell (i.e., a hollow ball), no net [[gravitational force]] is exerted by the shell on any object inside, regardless of the object's location within the shell.

A corollary is that inside a solid sphere of constant density, the gravitational force within the object varies linearly with distance from the centre, becoming zero by symmetry at the centre of mass. This can be seen as follows: take a point within such a sphere, at a distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from the centre of the sphere. Then you can ignore all the shells of greater radius, according to the shell theorem. So, the remaining mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to &lt;math&gt;r^3&lt;/math&gt; (because it is based on volume), and the gravitational force exerted on it is proportional to &lt;math&gt;m/r^2&lt;/math&gt; (the [[inverse square law]]), so the overall gravitational effect is proportional to &lt;math&gt;r^3/r^2 =r&lt;/math&gt;, so is linear in &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

These results were important to Newton's analysis of planetary motion; they are not immediately obvious, but they can be proven with [[calculus]]. (Alternatively, [[Gauss's law for gravity]] offers a much simpler way to prove the same results.)

In addition to gravity, the shell theorem can also be used to describe the [[electric field]] generated by a static spherically symmetric [[charge density]], or similarly for any other phenomenon that follows an [[inverse square law]]. The derivations below focus on gravity, but the results can easily be generalized to the [[electrostatic force]]. Moreover, the results can be generalized to the case of general ellipsoidal bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv

== Outside a shell ==
A solid, [[sphere|spherically]] [[symmetry|symmetric]] body can be modelled as an infinite number of [[concentric]], infinitesimally thin spherical shells. If one of these shells can be treated as a point mass, then a system of shells (i.e. the sphere) can also be treated as a point mass. Consider one such shell (the diagram shows a cross-section):

[[File:shell-diag-1.svg|center|500px]]

(Note: {{math|''d''{{var|θ}}}} appearing in the diagram refers to the small angle, not the [[arclength]]. The arclength is {{math|{{var|R}} ''d''{{var|θ}}}}.)

Applying [[Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation]], the sum of the forces due to mass elements in the shaded band is

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;dF = \frac{Gm \;dM}{s^2}.&lt;/math&gt;}}

However, since there is partial cancellation due to the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] nature of the force in conjunction with the circular band's symmetry, the leftover [[Vector (geometry)#Vector components|component]] (in the direction pointing toward ''m'') is given by

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;dF_r = \frac{Gm \;dM}{s^2} \cos\phi.&lt;/math&gt;}}

The total force on ''m'', then, is simply the sum of the force exerted by all the bands. By shrinking the width of each band, and increasing the number of bands, the sum becomes an integral expression:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F_r = \int dF_r&lt;/math&gt;}}

Since ''G'' and ''m'' are constants, they may be taken out of the integral:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F_r = Gm \int \frac{dM \cos\phi} {s^2}. &lt;/math&gt;}}

To evaluate this integral, one must first express ''dM'' as a function of ''dθ''

The total surface of a spherical shell is
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;4\pi R^2 &lt;/math&gt;}}
while the surface of the thin slice between ''θ'' and ''θ''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''dθ'' is
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;2\pi R^2\sin\theta \,d\theta &lt;/math&gt;}}

If the mass of the shell is ''M'', one therefore has that

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;dM = \frac {2\pi R^2\sin\theta }{4\pi R^2} M\,d\theta = \textstyle\frac{1}{2} M\sin\theta \,d\theta&lt;/math&gt;}}

and

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F_r = \frac{GMm}{2} \int \frac{\sin\theta \cos\phi} {s^2}\,d\theta &lt;/math&gt;}}

By the [[law of cosines]],

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\cos\phi = \frac{r^2 + s^2 - R^2}{2rs}&lt;/math&gt;}}

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\cos\theta = \frac{r^2 + R^2 - s^2}{2rR}.&lt;/math&gt;}}

These two relations link the three parameters ''θ'', ''ϕ'' and ''s'' that appear in the integral together. When ''θ'' increases from 0 to π radians, ''ϕ'' varies from the initial value 0 to a maximal value to finally return to zero for&amp;nbsp;''θ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;π. ''s'' on the other hand increases from the initial value ''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''R'' to the final value ''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''R'' when ''θ'' increases from 0 to π radians. 
This is illustrated in the following animation:

[[File:Shell-diag-1-anim.gif|center]]

(Note: As viewed from ''m'', the shaded blue band appears as a thin [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] whose inner and outer diameters converge to ''R'' sin ''θ'' as ''dθ'' vanishes.)

To find a [[primitive function]] to the integrand, one has to make ''s'' the independent integration variable instead of ''θ''.

Performing an [[implicit differentiation]] of the second of the "cosine law" expressions above yields

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\sin\theta \;d\theta = \frac{s}{rR} ds.&lt;/math&gt;}}

and one gets that

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F_r = \frac{GMm}{2rR} \int \frac{\cos\phi} {s}\,ds &lt;/math&gt;}}

where the new integration variable ''s'' increases from ''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''R'' to&amp;nbsp;''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''R''.

Inserting the expression for cos(''φ'') using the first of the "cosine law" expressions
above, one finally gets that

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F_r = \frac{GMm}{4r^2 R} \int \left( 1 + \frac{r^2 - R^2}{s^2} \right) \, ds.&lt;/math&gt;}}

A [[primitive function]] to the integrand is

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;s - \frac{r^2 - R^2}{s}&lt;/math&gt;}}

and inserting the bounds ''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''R'', ''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''R'' for the integration variable ''s'' in this primitive function, one gets that

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F_r = \frac{GMm}{r^2},&lt;/math&gt;}}

saying that the gravitational force is the same as that of a point mass in the centre of the shell with the same mass.

Finally, integrate all infinitesimally thin spherical shell with mass of ''dM'', and we can obtain the total gravity contribution of a solid ball to the object outside the ball

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F_{total} = \int dF_r = \frac{Gm}{r^2} \int dM.&lt;/math&gt;}}

Between the radius of ''x'' to ''x'' + ''dx'', ''dM'' can be expressed as a function of ''x'', i.e.,

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;dM = \frac{4 \pi x^2 dx}{\frac{4}{3} \pi R^3} M = \frac{3Mx^2 dx}{R^3}&lt;/math&gt;}}

Therefore, the total gravity is

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F_{total} = \frac{3GMm}{r^2 R^3} \int_{0}^{R} x^2 dx = \frac{GMm}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;}}

which suggests that the gravity of a solid spherical ball to an exterior object can be simplified as that of a point mass in the centre of the ball with the same mass.

== Inside a shell ==
For a point inside the shell, the difference is that when ''θ'' is equal to zero, ''ϕ'' takes the value π radians and ''s'' the value ''R'' - ''r''. When ''θ'' increases from 0 to
π radians, ''ϕ'' decreases from the initial value π radians to zero and ''s'' increases from the initial value ''R'' - ''r'' to the value ''R'' + ''r''.

This can all be seen in the following figure
[[File:shell-diag-2.svg|center|240px]]

Inserting these bounds into the [[primitive function]]

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;s - \frac{r^2 - R^2}{s}&lt;/math&gt;}}

one gets that, in this case

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F_r = 0 &lt;/math&gt;}}

saying that the net gravitational forces acting on the point mass from the mass elements of the shell, outside the measurement point, cancel out.

'''Generalization:''' If &lt;math&gt;f=k / r^p&lt;/math&gt;, the resultant force inside the shell is:
 
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F(r) = \frac{GMm}{4r^2 R} \int_{R-r}^{R+r} \left( \frac{1}{s^{p-2}} + \frac{r^2 - R^2}{s^p} \right) \, ds&lt;/math&gt;}}

The above results into &lt;math&gt;F(r)&lt;/math&gt; being identically zero if and only if &lt;math&gt;p=2&lt;/math&gt;

Outside the shell (i.e. r&gt;R or r&lt;-R):

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F(r) = \frac{GMm}{4r^2 R} \int_{r-R}^{r+R} \left( \frac{1}{s^{p-2}} + \frac{r^2 - R^2}{s^p} \right) \, ds&lt;/math&gt;}}

== Derivation using Gauss's law ==
The shell theorem is an immediate consequence of [[Gauss's law for gravity]] saying that

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\int_S {\mathbf g}\cdot \,d{\mathbf {S}} = -4 \pi GM&lt;/math&gt;}}

where ''M'' is the mass of the part of the spherically symmetric mass distribution that is inside the sphere with radius ''r'' and

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\int_S {\mathbf g}\cdot \,d{\mathbf {S}} = \int_S {\mathbf g}\cdot {\mathbf{\hat n}}\,dS&lt;/math&gt;}}
is the [[surface integral]] of the [[gravitational field]] '''g''' over any [[closed surface]] inside which the total mass is ''M'', the [[unit vector]] &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{ \hat n}&lt;/math&gt; being the outward normal to the surface.

The gravitational field of a spherically symmetric mass distribution like a mass point, a spherical shell or a homogenous sphere must also be spherically symmetric. If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{ \hat n}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector in the direction from the point of symmetry to another point the gravitational field at this other point must therefore be

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; \mathbf g = g(r)\mathbf{ \hat n }&lt;/math&gt;}}

where ''g''(''r'') only depends on the distance ''r'' to the point of symmetry

Selecting the closed surface as a sphere with radius ''r'' with center at the point of symmetry the outward normal to a point on the surface, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{ \hat n }&lt;/math&gt;, is precisely the direction pointing away from the point of symmetry of the mass distribution.

One, therefore, has that

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; \mathbf {g} = g(r)\mathbf{ \hat n }&lt;/math&gt;}}

and

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\int_S \mathbf g \cdot \,d{\mathbf {S}} = g(r) \int_S \,d{S} = g(r) 4\pi r^2 &lt;/math&gt;}}

as the area of the sphere is 4π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

From Gauss's law it then follows that
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; g(r) 4\pi r^2 = -4 \pi GM &lt;/math&gt;}}

i.e. that
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; g(r) = -\frac {GM}{r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;}}

== Converses and generalizations ==

It is natural to ask whether the [[Theorem#Converse|converse]] of the shell theorem is true, namely whether the result of the theorem implies the law of universal gravitation, or if there is some more general force law for which the theorem holds. More specifically, one may ask the question:

{{block indent|Suppose there is a force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; between masses ''M'' and ''m'', separated by a distance ''r'' of the form &lt;math&gt;F = M m f(r)&lt;/math&gt; such that any spherically symmetric body affects external bodies as if its mass were concentrated at its centre. Then what form can the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; take?}}

In fact, this allows exactly one more class of force than the (Newtonian) inverse square.&lt;ref name=Gurzadyan&gt;{{cite journal| last=Gurzadyan |first=Vahe |authorlink=vahe Gurzadyan|title=The cosmological constant in McCrea-Milne cosmological scheme|journal=The Observatory|date= 1985|volume=105|pages=42–43|bibcode=1985Obs...105...42G}} http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1985Obs...105...42G&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arens&gt;{{cite journal| last=Arens| first=Richard| authorlink=Richard Friederich Arens|title=Newton's observations about the field of a uniform thin spherical shell|journal=Note di Matematica|date=January 1, 1990|volume=X|issue=Suppl. n. 1|pages=39–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most general force as derived in &lt;ref name="Gurzadyan"/&gt; is:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; F = -\frac{G M m}{r^2} - \frac{\Lambda M m r}{3} &lt;/math&gt;}}

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; can be constants taking any value. The first term is the familiar law of universal gravitation; the second is an additional force, analogous to the [[cosmological constant]] term in [[general relativity]].

If we further constrain the force by requiring that the second part of the theorem also holds, namely that there is no force inside a hollow ball, we exclude the possibility of the additional term, and the inverse square law is indeed the unique force law satisfying the theorem.

On the other hand, if we relax the conditions, and require only that the field everywhere outside a spherically symmetric body is the same as the field from some point mass at the centre (of any mass), we allow a new class of solutions given by the [[Yukawa potential]], of which the inverse square law is a special case.

Another generalization can be made for a disc by observing that 

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;dM=\frac{R^2}{2} \frac{d\theta \sin^2{\theta}}{\pi R^2}M=\frac{ \sin^2{\theta}}{2 \pi}M d\theta &lt;/math&gt;}}

so:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F_r = \frac{GMm}{2 \pi} \int \frac{ \sin^2{\theta} \cos\phi} {s^2}d\theta,&lt;/math&gt;}}

where &lt;math&gt;M=\pi R^2 \rho.&lt;/math&gt;

Doing all the intermediate calculations we get:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F(r) = \frac{Gm \rho}{8r^3} \int_{R-r}^{R+r} { \frac{(r^2+s^2-R^2)\sqrt{2(r^2R^2+r^2s^2+R^2s^2)-s^4-r^4-R^4}}{s^2} } \, ds&lt;/math&gt;}}

Note that &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; in this example is expressed in &lt;math&gt;\frac{kg}{m^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Newton's proofs ==

=== Introduction ===

Propositions 70 and 71 consider the force acting on a particle from a hollow sphere with an infinitesimally thin surface, whose mass density is constant over the surface. The force on the particle from a small area of the surface of the sphere is proportional to the mass of the area and inversely as the square of its distance from the particle. The first proposition considers the case when the particle is inside the sphere, the second when it is outside. The use of infinitesimals and limiting processes in geometrical constructions are simple and elegant and avoid the need for any integrations. They well illustrate Newton's method of proving many of the propositions in the ''Principia''.	

His proof of Propositions 70 is trivial. In the following, it is considered in slightly greater detail than Newton provides.

The proof of Proposition 71 is more historically significant. It forms the first part of his proof that the gravitational force of a solid sphere acting on a particle outside it is inversely proportional to the square of its distance from the centre of the sphere, provided the density at any point inside the sphere is a function only of its distance from the centre of the sphere.

Although the following are completely faithful to Newton's proofs, very minor changes have been made to attempt to make them clearer.

=== Force on a point inside a hollow sphere ===

[[File:Attraction Interior Sphere.png|Attraction interior sphere]]

Fig. 2 is a cross-section of the hollow sphere through the centre, S and an arbitrary point, P, inside the sphere. Through P draw two lines IL and HK such that the angle KPL is very small. JM is the line through P that bisects that angle. From the geometry of circles, the triangles IPH and KPL are similar. 
The lines KH and IL are rotated about the axis JM to form 2 cones that intersect the sphere in 2 closed curves. In Fig. 1 the sphere is seen from a distance along the line PE and is assumed transparent so both curves can be seen. 

The surface of the sphere that the cones intersect can be considered to be flat, and angles &lt;math&gt; PJI = PMK &lt;/math&gt;

Since the intersection of a cone with a plane is an ellipse, in this case the intersections form two ellipses with major axes IH and KL, where &lt;math&gt; \frac{IH}{KL} = \frac{PJ}{PM} &lt;/math&gt;

By a similar argument, the minor axes are in the same ratio. This is clear if the sphere is viewed from above. Therefore the two ellipses are similar, so their areas are as the squares of their major axes. As the mass of any section of the surface is proportional to the area of that section, for the 2 elliptical areas the ratios of their masses &lt;math&gt; \propto \frac{PJ^2}{PM^2} &lt;/math&gt;.

Since the force of attraction on P in the direction JM from either of the elliptic areas, is direct as the mass of the area and inversely as the square of its distance from P, it is independent of the distance of P from the sphere. Hence, the forces on P from the 2 infinitesimal elliptical areas are equal and opposite and there is no net force in the direction JM.  

As the position of P and the direction of JM are both arbitrary, it follows that any particle inside a hollow sphere experiences no net force from the mass of the sphere.

Note: Newton simply describes the arcs IH and KL as 'minimally small' and the areas traced out by the lines IL and HK can be any shape, not necessarily elliptic, but they will always be similar.

=== Force on a point outside a hollow sphere ===

[[File:Attraction Exterior Sphere.png|Attraction exterior sphere]]

Fig. 1 is a cross-section of the hollow sphere through the centre, S with an arbitrary point, P, outside the sphere. PT is the tangent to the circle at T which passes through P. HI is a small arc on the surface such that PH is less than PT. Extend PI to intersect the sphere at L and draw SF to the point F that bisects IL. Extend PH to intersect the sphere at K and draw SE to the point E that bisects HK, and extend SF to intersect HK at D. Drop a perpendicular IQ on to the line PS joining P to the centre S. Let the radius of the sphere be a and the distance PS be D.

Let arc IH be extended perpendicularly out of the plane of the diagram, by a small distance ζ. The area of the figure generated is IH.ζ, and its mass is proportional to this product.

The force due to this mass on the particle at P &lt;math&gt; \propto \frac{IH.\zeta}{PI^2} &lt;/math&gt; and is along the line PI. 

The component of this force towards the centre &lt;math&gt; \propto \frac{IH.\zeta.PQ}{PI^3} &lt;/math&gt;.

If now the arc HI is rotated completely about the line PS to form a ring of width HI and radius IQ, the length of the ring is 2π.IQ and its area is 2π.IQ.IH. The component of the force due to this ring on the particle at P in the direction PS becomes &lt;math&gt; \propto \frac{IH.IQ.PQ}{PI^3} &lt;/math&gt;.

The perpendicular components of the force directed towards PS cancel out since the mass in the ring is distributed symmetrically about PS. Therefore, the component in the direction PS is the total force on P due to the ring formed by rotating arc HI about PS.

From similar triangles: &lt;math&gt; \frac{IQ}{PI} = \frac{FS}{D}&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt; \frac{PQ}{PI} = \frac{PF}{D}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \frac{RI}{PI} = \frac{DF}{PF}&lt;/math&gt;

If HI is sufficiently small that it can be taken as a straight line, SIH is a right angle, and the angles &lt;math&gt; RIH = FIS &lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt; \frac{HI}{RI} = \frac{a}{IF}&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence the force on P due to the ring &lt;math&gt; \propto \frac{IH.IQ.PQ}{PI^3} = \frac{a.DF.FS.PF}{IF.PF.D.D} = \frac{a.DF.FS}{IF.D^2} &lt;/math&gt;.

Assume now in Fig. 2 that another particle is outside the sphere at a point, p, a different distance, d, from the centre of the sphere, with corresponding points lettered in lower case. For easy comparison, the construction of P in Fig. 1 is also shown in Fig. 2. As before, ph is less than pt.

Generate a ring with width ih and radius iq by making angle &lt;math&gt; fiS = FIS &lt;/math&gt; and the slightly larger Angle &lt;math&gt; dhS = DHS &lt;/math&gt;, so that the distance PS is subtended by the same angle at I as is pS at i. The same holds for H and h, respectively.

The total force on p due to this ring is 

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; \propto \frac{ih.iq.pq}{pi^3} = \frac{a.df.fS}{if.d^2} &lt;/math&gt;}}

Clearly &lt;math&gt; fS = FS &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; if = IF &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; eS = ES &lt;/math&gt;.

Newton claims that DF and df can be taken as equal in the limit as the angles DPF and dpf 'vanish together'. Note that angles DPF and dpf are not equal. Although DS and dS become equal in the limit, this does not imply that the ratio of DF to df becomes equal to unity, when DF and df both approach zero. In the finite case DF depends on D, and df on d, so they are not equal.
 
Since the ratio of DF to df in the limit is crucial, more detailed analysis is required. From the similar right triangles, &lt;math&gt; \frac {DF}{PF} = \frac{ED}{ES}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; ED^2 = (DF + FS)^2 - ES^2 &lt;/math&gt;, giving &lt;math&gt; \frac {(PF^2 - ES^2)DF^2}{PF^2} +  2.FS.DF + FS^2 - ES^2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. Solving the quadratic for DF, in the limit as ES approaches FS, the smaller root, &lt;math&gt; DF = ES - FS &lt;/math&gt;. More simply, as DF approaches zero, in the limit the &lt;math&gt; DF^2 &lt;/math&gt; term can be ignored: &lt;math&gt; 2.FS.DF + FS^2 - ES^2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt; leading to the same result. Clearly df has the same limit, justifying Newton’s claim.

Comparing the force from the ring HI rotated about PS to the ring hi about pS, the ratio of these 2 forces equals &lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2}{D^2} &lt;/math&gt;.

By dividing up the arcs AT and Bt into corresponding infinitesimal rings, it follows that the ratio of the force due to the arc AT rotated about PS to that of Bt rotated about pS is in the same ratio, and similarly, the ratio of the forces due to arc TB to that of tA both rotated are in the same ratio.

Therefore, the force on a particle any distance D from the centre of the hollow sphere is inversely proportional to &lt;math&gt; D^2 &lt;/math&gt;, which proves the proposition.

== Shell theorem in general relativity ==
There is an analog of the shell theorem in general relativity (GR). The shell theorem shows that the gravitational potential outside a spherically symmetric body is given by -GM/r—whether or not the body is changing with time. In general relativity, there is a similar theorem that demonstrating that the spacetime geometry ''outside'' a spherically symmetric mass-energy distribution is the time-independent Schwarzschild geometry—even if the central mass is undergoing gravitational collapse (Misner et al. 1973). 

This equivalent of the shell theorem in GR is very useful because it allows to use the machinery of the Schwarzschild metric to understand the gravitational collapse leading to a black hole, and its effect on the motion of light-rays and particles outside and inside the event horizon (Hartle 2003, chapter 12).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2175">In mathematics, a '''supersingular variety''' is (usually) a smooth [[projective variety]] in nonzero [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] such that for all ''n'' the [[slope]]s of the [[F-crystal|Newton polygon]] of the ''n''th [[crystalline cohomology]] are all&amp;nbsp;''n''/2 {{harv|de Jong|2014}}. For special classes of varieties such as elliptic curves it is common to use various ad hoc definitions of "supersingular", which are (usually) equivalent to the one given above.

The term "singular elliptic curve" (or "singular ''j''-invariant") was at one times used to refer to complex [[elliptic curve]]s whose ring of [[endomorphism]]s has rank&amp;nbsp;2, the maximum possible. [[Helmut Hasse]] discovered that, in finite characteristic, elliptic curves can have larger rings of endomorphisms of rank&amp;nbsp;4, and these were called "supersingular elliptic curves". Supersingular elliptic curves can also be characterized by the slopes of their crystalline cohomology, and the term "supersingular" was later extended to other varieties whose cohomology has similar properties. The terms "supersingular" or "singular" do not mean that the variety has singularites.

Examples include:
*[[Supersingular elliptic curve]]. Elliptic curves in non-zero characteristic with an unusually large ring of endomorphisms of rank 4. 
*[[Supersingular Abelian variety]] Sometimes defined to be an abelian variety isogenous to a product of supersingular elliptic curves, and sometimes defined to be an abelian variety of some rank ''g''  whose endomorphism ring has rank (2''g'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  
*[[Supersingular K3 surface]]. Certain K3 surfaces in non-zero characteristic. 
*[[Supersingular Enriques surface]]. Certain Enriques surfaces in characteristic 2.
*A surface is called '''Shioda supersingular''' if the rank of its Néron–Severi group is equal to its second Betti number.
*A surface is called '''Artin supersingular''' if its formal Brauer group has infinite height.

In [[mathematics]], a '''theorem''' is a [[statement (logic)|statement]] that has been [[Mathematical proof|proven]] on the basis of previously established statements, such as other theorems, and generally accepted statements, such as [[axiom]]s. A theorem is a [[logical consequence]] of the axioms. The proof of a mathematical theorem is a logical argument for the theorem statement given in accord with the rules of a [[deductive system]]. The proof of a theorem is often interpreted as justification of the truth of the theorem statement. In light of the requirement that theorems be proved, the concept of a theorem is fundamentally ''[[deductive]]'', in contrast to the notion of a [[scientific law]], which is ''[[experimental]]''.&lt;ref&gt;However, both theorems and scientific law are the result of investigations. See {{harvnb|Heath|1897}} Introduction, The terminology of [[Archimedes]], p. clxxxii:"theorem (θεὼρνμα) from θεωρεἳν to investigate"&lt;/ref&gt;

Many mathematical theorems are conditional statements. In this case, the proof deduces the conclusion from conditions called '''hypotheses''' or [[premise]]s. In light of the interpretation of proof as justification of truth, the conclusion is often viewed as a necessary consequence of the [[hypotheses]], namely, that the conclusion is true in case the hypotheses are true, without any further assumptions. However, the conditional could be interpreted differently in certain [[deductive system]]s, depending on the meanings assigned to the derivation rules and the conditional symbol.

Although they can be written in a completely symbolic form, for example, within the [[propositional calculus]], theorems are often expressed in a natural language such as English. The same is true of proofs, which are often expressed as logically organized and clearly worded informal arguments, intended to convince readers of the truth of the statement of the theorem beyond any doubt, and from which a formal symbolic proof can in principle be constructed. Such arguments are typically easier to check than purely symbolic ones—indeed, many mathematicians would express a preference for a proof that not only demonstrates the validity of a theorem, but also explains in some way ''why'' it is obviously true. In some cases, a picture alone may be sufficient to prove a theorem. Because theorems lie at the core of mathematics, they are also central to its aesthetics. Theorems are often described as being "trivial", or "difficult", or "deep", or even "beautiful". These subjective judgments vary not only from person to person, but also with time: for example, as a proof is simplified or better understood, a theorem that was once difficult may become trivial. On the other hand, a deep theorem may be stated simply, but its proof may involve surprising and subtle connections between disparate areas of mathematics. [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] is a particularly well-known example of such a theorem.

== Informal account of theorems ==

[[Logically]], many theorems are of the form of an [[indicative conditional]]: ''if A, then B''. Such a theorem does not assert ''B'', only that ''B'' is a necessary consequence of ''A''. In this case ''A'' is called the '''[[hypothesis]]''' of the theorem ("hypothesis" here is something very different from a [[conjecture]]) and ''B'' the '''conclusion''' (formally, ''A'' and ''B'' are termed the ''antecedent'' and ''consequent''). The theorem "If ''n'' is an even [[natural number]] then ''n''/2 is a natural number" is a typical example in which the hypothesis is "''n'' is an even natural number" and the conclusion is "''n''/2 is also a natural number".

To be proved, a theorem must be expressible as a precise, formal statement. Nevertheless, theorems are usually expressed in natural language rather than in a completely symbolic form, with the intention that the reader can produce a formal statement from the informal one.

It is common in mathematics to choose a number of hypotheses within a given language and declare that the theory consists of all statements provable from these hypotheses. These hypotheses form the foundational basis of the theory and are called axioms or postulates. The field of mathematics known as [[proof theory]] studies formal languages, axioms and the structure of proofs.

[[File:4CT Non-Counterexample 1.svg|frame|right|A [[Plane (mathematics)|planar]] map with five colors such that no two regions with the same color meet. It can actually be colored in this way with only four colors. The [[four color theorem]] states that such colorings are possible for any planar map, but every known proof involves a computational search that is too long to check by hand.]]
Some theorems are "trivial", in the sense that they follow from definitions, axioms, and other theorems in obvious ways and do not contain any surprising insights. Some, on the other hand, may be called "deep", because their proofs may be long and difficult, involve areas of mathematics superficially distinct from the statement of the theorem itself, or show surprising connections between disparate areas of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Deep Theorem|urlname=DeepTheorem}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theorem might be simple to state and yet be deep. An excellent example is [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], and there are many other examples of simple yet deep theorems in [[number theory]] and [[combinatorics]], among other areas.

Other theorems have a known proof that cannot easily be written down. The most prominent examples are the four color theorem and the [[Kepler conjecture]]. Both of these theorems are only known to be true by reducing them to a computational search that is then verified by a computer program. Initially, many mathematicians did not accept this form of proof, but it has become more widely accepted. The mathematician [[Doron Zeilberger]] has even gone so far as to claim that these are possibly the only nontrivial results that mathematicians have ever proved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Doron Zeilberger|authorlink=Doron Zeilberger|title=Opinion 51|url=http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/Opinion51.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many mathematical theorems can be reduced to more straightforward computation, including polynomial identities, trigonometric identities and hypergeometric identities.&lt;ref&gt;Petkovsek et al. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2010}}

==Provability and theoremhood==

To establish a mathematical statement as a theorem, a proof is required, that is, a line of reasoning from axioms in the system (and other, already established theorems) to the given statement must be demonstrated. However, the proof is usually considered as separate from the theorem statement. Although more than one proof may be known for a single theorem, only one proof is required to establish the status of a statement as a theorem. The [[Pythagorean theorem]] and the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]] are contenders for the title of theorem with the greatest number of distinct proofs.

==Relation with scientific theories==
{{unreferenced-section|date=February 2018}}
Theorems in mathematics and theories in science are fundamentally different in their [[epistemology]]. A scientific theory cannot be proved; its key attribute is that it is [[falsifiable]], that is, it makes predictions about the natural world that are testable by [[experiment]]s. Any disagreement between prediction and experiment demonstrates the incorrectness of the scientific theory, or at least limits its accuracy or domain of validity. Mathematical theorems, on the other hand, are purely abstract formal statements: the proof of a theorem cannot involve experiments or other empirical evidence in the same way such evidence is used to support scientific theories.

[[File:CollatzFractal.png|thumb|250px|right|The [[Collatz conjecture]]: one way to illustrate its complexity is to extend the iteration from the natural numbers to the complex numbers. The result is a [[fractal]], which (in accordance with [[universality (dynamical systems)|universality]]) resembles the [[Mandelbrot set]].]]
Nonetheless, there is some degree of empiricism and data collection involved in the discovery of mathematical theorems. By establishing a pattern, sometimes with the use of a powerful computer, mathematicians may have an idea of what to prove, and in some cases even a plan for how to set about doing the proof. For example, the [[Collatz conjecture]] has been verified for start values up to about 2.88&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[Riemann hypothesis]] has been verified for the first 10 trillion zeroes of the [[Riemann zeta function|zeta function]]. Neither of these statements is considered proved.

Such evidence does not constitute proof. For example, the [[Mertens conjecture]] is a statement about natural numbers that is now known to be false, but no explicit counterexample (i.e., a natural number ''n'' for which the Mertens function ''M''(''n'') equals or exceeds the square root of ''n'') is known: all numbers less than 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; have the Mertens property, and the smallest number that does not have this property is only known to be less than the [[exponential function|exponential]] of 1.59&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;, which is approximately 10 to the power 4.3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;. Since the number of particles in the universe is generally considered less than 10 to the power 100 (a [[googol]]), there is no hope to find an explicit counterexample by [[exhaustive search]].

The word "theory" also exists in mathematics, to denote a body of mathematical axioms, definitions and theorems, as in, for example, [[group theory]]. There are also "theorems" in science, particularly physics, and in engineering, but they often have statements and proofs in which physical assumptions and intuition play an important role; the physical axioms on which such "theorems" are based are themselves falsifiable.

==Terminology==
A number of different terms for mathematical statements exist; these terms indicate the role statements play in a particular subject. The distinction between different terms is sometimes rather arbitrary and the usage of some terms has evolved over time.

* An '''[[axiom]]''' or '''postulate''' is a statement that is accepted without proof and regarded as fundamental to a subject. Historically these have been regarded as "self-evident", but more recently they are considered assumptions that characterize the subject of study. In classical geometry, axioms are general statements, while postulates are statements about geometrical objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Plane Geometry
|first1=G.|last1=Wentworth|first2=D.E.|last2=Smith|publisher=Ginn &amp; Co.
|year=1913|chapter=Art. 46, 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[definition]] is also accepted without proof since it simply gives the meaning of a word or phrase in terms of known concepts.

* An unproved statement that is believed true is called a '''conjecture''' (or sometimes a '''hypothesis''', but with a different meaning from the one discussed above). To be considered a conjecture, a statement must usually be proposed publicly, at which point the name of the proponent may be attached to the conjecture, as with [[Goldbach's conjecture]]. Other famous conjectures include the [[Collatz conjecture]] and the [[Riemann hypothesis]]. On the other hand, [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] has always been known by that name, even before it was proved; it was never known as "Fermat's conjecture".
* A '''[[proposition]]''' is a theorem of lesser importance. This term sometimes connotes a statement with a simple proof, while the term '''theorem''' is usually reserved for the most important results or those with long or difficult proofs. Some authors never use "proposition", while some others use "theorem" only for fundamental results. In classical geometry, this term was used differently: In [[Euclid's Elements]] (c. 300 BCE), all theorems and geometric constructions were called "propositions" regardless of their importance.
* A '''[[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]]''' is a "helping theorem", a proposition with little applicability except that it forms part of the proof of a larger theorem. In some cases, as the relative importance of different theorems becomes more clear, what was once considered a lemma is now considered a theorem, though the word "lemma" remains in the name. Examples include [[Gauss's lemma (polynomial)|Gauss's lemma]], [[Zorn's lemma]], and the [[Fundamental lemma (Langlands program)|fundamental lemma]].
* A '''[[corollary]]''' is a proposition that follows with little proof from another theorem or definition.&lt;ref&gt;Wentworth &amp; Smith Art. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Also a corollary can be a theorem restated for a more restricted [[special case]]. For example, the theorem that all angles in a [[rectangle]] are [[right angle]]s has as corollary that all angles in a [[square]] (a [[special case]] of a rectangle) are [[right angle]]s.
* {{anchor|Converse}}A '''[[Converse (logic)|converse]]''' of a theorem is a statement formed by interchanging what is given in a theorem and what is to be proved. For example, the [[isosceles triangle theorem]] states that if two sides of a triangle are equal then two angles are equal. In the converse, the given (that two sides are equal) and what is to be proved (that two angles are equal) are swapped, so the converse is the statement that if two angles of a triangle are equal then two sides are equal. In this example, the converse can be proved as another theorem, but this is often not the case. For example, the converse to the theorem that two right angles are equal angles is the statement that two equal angles must be right angles, and this is clearly not always the case.&lt;ref&gt;Follows Wentworth &amp; Smith Art. 79&lt;/ref&gt;
* A '''[[generalization]]''' is a theorem which includes a previously proved theorem as a [[special case]] and hence as a corollary.

There are other terms, less commonly used, that are conventionally attached to proved statements, so that certain theorems are referred to by historical or customary names. For example:

* An '''[[Identity (mathematics)|identity]]''' is an equality, contained in a theorem, between two mathematical expressions that holds regardless of what values are used for any [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] or [[parameter]]s appearing in the expressions. Examples include [[Euler's formula]] and [[Vandermonde's identity]].
* A '''rule''' is a theorem, such as [[Bayes' rule]] and [[Cramer's rule]], that establishes a useful formula.
* A '''[[Laws of science|law]]''' or a '''[[principle]]''' is a theorem that applies in a wide range of circumstances. Examples include the [[law of large numbers]], the [[law of cosines]], [[Kolmogorov's zero–one law]], [[Harnack's principle]], the [[least-upper-bound principle]], and the [[pigeonhole principle]].&lt;ref&gt;The word ''law'' can also refer to an axiom, a [[rule of inference]], or, in [[probability theory]], a [[probability distribution]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A few well-known theorems have even more idiosyncratic names. The '''division algorithm''' (see [[Euclidean division]]) is a theorem expressing the outcome of division in the natural numbers and more general rings. '''[[Bézout's identity]]''' is a theorem asserting that the greatest common divisor of two numbers may be written as a linear combination of these numbers. The '''[[Banach–Tarski paradox]]''' is a theorem in [[measure (mathematics)|measure theory]] that is [[paradox]]ical in the sense that it contradicts common intuitions about volume in three-dimensional space.

==Layout==

A theorem and its proof are typically laid out as follows:

:'''Theorem''' (name of person who proved it and year of discovery, proof or publication).
:''Statement of theorem (sometimes called the ''proposition'').''
:'''Proof'''.
:''Description of proof.''
:''End''

The end of the proof may be signalled by the letters [[Q.E.D.]] (''quod erat demonstrandum'') or by one of the [[Tombstone (typography)|tombstone]] marks "□" or "∎" meaning "End of Proof", introduced by [[Paul Halmos]] following their usage in magazine articles.

The exact style depends on the author or publication. Many publications provide instructions or [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] for typesetting in the [[Style guide|house style]].

It is common for a theorem to be preceded by [[definition]]s describing the exact meaning of the terms used in the theorem. It is also common for a theorem to be preceded by a number of propositions or lemmas which are then used in the proof. However, lemmas are sometimes embedded in the proof of a theorem, either with nested proofs, or with their proofs presented after the proof of the theorem.

Corollaries to a theorem are either presented between the theorem and the proof, or directly after the proof. Sometimes, corollaries have proofs of their own that explain why they follow from the theorem.

==Lore==

It has been estimated that over a quarter of a million theorems are proved every year.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998,  p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

The well-known [[aphorism]], [[q:Paul Erdős|"A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems"]], is probably due to [[Alfréd Rényi]], although it is often attributed to Rényi's colleague [[Paul Erdős]] (and Rényi may have been thinking of Erdős), who was famous for the many theorems he produced, the [[Erdős number|number]] of his collaborations, and his coffee drinking.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[classification of finite simple groups]] is regarded by some to be the longest proof of a theorem. It comprises tens of thousands of pages in 500 journal articles by some 100 authors. These papers are together believed to give a complete proof, and several ongoing projects hope to shorten and simplify this proof.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plus.maths.org/issue41/features/elwes/index.html An enormous theorem: the classification of finite simple groups], Richard Elwes, Plus Magazine, Issue 41 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Another theorem of this type is the [[four color theorem]] whose computer generated proof is too long for a human to read. It is certainly the longest known proof of a theorem whose statement can be easily understood by a layman.

==Theorems in logic==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}
[[Logic]], especially in the field of proof theory, considers theorems as statements (called '''[[formula]]s''' or '''[[well formed formula]]s''') of a formal language. The statements of the language are strings of symbols and  may be broadly divided into [[nonsense]] and well-formed formulas. A set of '''deduction rules''', also called '''transformation rules''' or [[rules of inference]], must be provided. These deduction rules tell exactly when a formula can be derived from a set of premises. The set of well-formed formulas may be broadly divided into theorems and non-theorems. However, according to [[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter]], a formal system often simply defines all its well-formed formula as theorems.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter 1980&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|Also need to know the edition, and verify that in the references.  There are at least 4 English language editions of the book, in 1979, 1980, and two in 1999.|date=October 2010}}

Different sets of derivation rules give rise to different interpretations of what it means for an expression to be a theorem. Some derivation rules and formal languages are intended to capture mathematical reasoning; the most common examples use [[first-order logic]]. Other deductive systems describe [[term rewriting]], such as the reduction rules for [[lambda calculus|λ calculus]].

The definition of theorems as elements of a formal language allows for results in proof theory that study the structure of formal proofs and the structure of provable formulas. The most famous result is Gödel's incompleteness theorem; by representing theorems about basic number theory as expressions in a formal language, and then representing this language within number theory itself, Gödel constructed examples of statements that are neither provable nor disprovable from axiomatizations of number theory.

[[File:Formal languages.svg|thumb|300px|right|This diagram shows the [[Syntax (logic)|syntactic entities]] that can be constructed from [[formal language]]s. The [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] and [[string (computer science)|strings of symbols]] may be broadly divided into [[nonsense]] and [[well-formed formula]]s. A formal language can be thought of as identical to the set of its well-formed formulas. The set of well-formed formulas may be broadly divided into theorems and non-theorems.]]
A theorem may be expressed in a [[formal language]] (or "formalized"). A formal theorem is the purely formal analogue of a theorem. In general, a formal theorem is a type of [[well-formed formula]] that satisfies certain logical and syntactic conditions. The notation {{tee}} &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is often used to indicate that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a theorem.

Formal theorems consist of [[Formula (mathematical logic)|formulas]] of a formal language and the [[transformation rule]]s of a formal system. Specifically, a formal theorem is always the last formula of a [[formal proof|derivation]] in some formal system each formula of which is a [[logical consequence]] of the formulas that came before it in the derivation. The initially accepted formulas in the derivation are called its '''axioms''', and are the basis on which the theorem is derived. A [[set (mathematics)|set]] of theorems is called a '''theory'''.

What makes formal theorems useful and of interest is that they can be [[interpretation (logic)|interpreted]] as true [[proposition]]s and their derivations may be interpreted as a proof of the [[truth]] of the resulting expression. A set of formal theorems may be referred to as a '''[[theory (mathematical logic)|formal theory]]'''. A theorem whose interpretation is a true statement about a formal system is called a '''[[metatheorem]]'''.

=== Syntax and semantics ===
{{Main|Syntax (logic)|Formal semantics (logic)}}

The concept of a formal theorem is fundamentally syntactic, in contrast to the notion of a ''true proposition,'' which introduces [[semantics]]. Different deductive systems can yield other interpretations, depending on the presumptions of the derivation rules (i.e. [[belief]], [[Theory of justification|justification]] or other [[Modal logic|modalities]]). The [[soundness]] of a formal system depends on whether or not all of its theorems are also [[Validity (logic)|validities]]. A validity is a formula that is true under any possible interpretation, e.g. in classical propositional logic validities are [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]]. A formal system is considered [[completeness (logic)|semantically complete]] when all of its tautologies are also theorems.

=== Derivation of a theorem ===
{{Main|Formal proof}}

The notion of a theorem is very closely connected to its formal proof (also called a "derivation"). To illustrate how derivations are done, we will work in a very simplified formal system. Let us call ours &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; Its alphabet consists only of two symbols { '''A''', '''B''' } and its formation rule for formulas is:
:Any string of symbols of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; that is at least three symbols long, and is not infinitely long, is a formula. Nothing else is a formula.

The single axiom of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; is:
:'''ABBA'''.

The only [[rule of inference]] (transformation rule) for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; is:
:Any occurrence of "'''A'''" in a theorem may be replaced by an occurrence of the string "'''AB'''" and the result is a theorem.

Theorems in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; are defined as those formulae that have a derivation ending with that formula. For example,

#'''ABBA''' (Given as axiom)
#'''ABBBA''' (by applying the transformation rule)
#'''ABBBAB''' (by applying the transformation rule)

is a derivation. Therefore, "'''ABBBAB'''" is a theorem of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS} \,.&lt;/math&gt; The notion of truth (or falsity) cannot be applied to the formula "'''ABBBAB'''" until an interpretation is given to its symbols. Thus in this example, the formula does not yet represent a proposition, but is merely an empty abstraction.

Two metatheorems of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; are:
:Every theorem begins with "'''A'''".
:Every theorem has exactly two "'''A'''"s.
