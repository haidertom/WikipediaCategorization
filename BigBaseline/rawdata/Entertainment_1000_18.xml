      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7223">A {{nihongo|'''2.5 dimensional musical'''|2.5次元ミュージカル|2.5 jigen myujikaru}} (abbrievated into '''2.5D musical'''), also known as an '''anime musical''', is a type of modern Japanese [[Theatre of Japan|theatre production]] based exclusively on popular Japanese anime, manga, or video games. The term "2.5D musical" was coined to describe stories presented in two-dimensional medium being brought to real life.&lt;ref name="japantimes1"&gt;{{cite news | author=Nobuko Tanaka | url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2015/03/31/stage/tenimyu-2-5-d-shows-net-2-million-tickets-sold/#.W3C9LsInbIU | title=‘Tenimyu’ 2.5-D shows net over 2 million tickets sold | work=[[The Japan Times]] | date=2015-03-31 | accessdate=2018-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 70 2.5D musicals were produced in 2013 and attracted at least 1.6 million people, most of them young women in their teens and 20s. 2.5D musicals are often seen as the starting point of many young actors in Japan.&lt;ref name="japanbullet1"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.japanbullet.com/news/2-5-d-musicals-based-on-manga-and-anime-popular-with-young-women | title=‘2.5 - D’ Musicals, Based On Manga And Anime, Popular With Young Women | work=Japan Bullet | date=2015-08-13 | accessdate=2018-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

2.5D musicals are defined through make-up and costuming that accurately depicts the actor as the original character, along with exaggerated acting that mimics the original expressions in the original work. It also include special effects and stunts that reenact the setting and tone of the original work. Directors of the musicals are usually the ones who write the lyrics to the songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.themagicrain.com/2018/02/interview-with-japanese-music-industry-experts-comic-fiesta-2017/ | title=Interview with Japanese Music Industry Experts – Comic Fiesta 2017 | work=The Magic Rain | date=2018-02-05 | accessdate=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the evolution of technology, some of the modern 2.5D musicals uses [[projection mapping]], in which backgrounds and special effects are projected onto the stage and screens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://spice.eplus.jp/articles/96302 | title=藤原祐規×演出家・キムラ真インタビュー！　舞台『PERSONA3 the Weird Masquerade』完結作を語る | work=Spice | language=Japanese | date=2017-01-28 | accessdate=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Japan 2.5-Dimensional Musical Association, the term not only applies to musicals, but also plays, comedies, and dramas.&lt;ref name="webjapan1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://web-japan.org/trends/11_culture/pop171214.html | title=“2.5 Dimensional Musical” Live Theater | work=Web Japan | accessdate=2018-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first successful manga-based musical production was ''[[The Rose of Versailles]]'' in 1974 by the [[Takarazuka Revue]].&lt;ref name="japanbullet1"/&gt; At the time, these plays were simply known as "musicals" or "anime musicals."&lt;ref name="interview1"&gt;{{cite web | author=Norio Kohyama | url=http://performingarts.jp/E/pre_interview/1511/1.html | title=Presenter Interview: The vision of Makoto Matsuda, the producer behind the "2.5-D Musicals" | work=Performing Arts Network Japan | accessdate=2018-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the 1990s, a number of musicals and small stage skits produced were based on anime and manga series aimed at elementary school girls, such as ''[[Sailor Moon musicals|Sailor Moon]]'', ''[[Akazukin Chacha]]'', and ''[[Hime-chan's Ribbon]]'', which performed moderately well, but were not popular and were known as {{nihongo|"musicals for elementary school girls"|女児物|joji mono}}.&lt;ref name="interview1"/&gt; However, in 2000, ''[[Hunter x Hunter]]'' became revolutionary at the time because the voice cast for the original anime series had also played the characters on stage.&lt;ref name="interview1"/&gt;

Japanese media-based musicals rose to popularity in 2003 with ''[[Tenimyu|Musical: The Prince of Tennis]]'' through word-of-mouth and social media, which soon became a starting point for many up-and-coming actors. The shows attracted more than 2 million people during its run and was notable for using stage effects to simulate a tennis match,&lt;ref name="japantimes1"/&gt; and it was popular enough to include its first overseas shows in South Korea and Taiwan in 2008.&lt;ref name="interview1"/&gt; After its success, many productions based on anime, manga, and video games soon followed, some of the well-documented ones including ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[Yowamushi Pedal]]'', ''[[Haikyu!!|Hyper Projection Engeki Haikyu!!]]'' among others. Unlike productions featuring the Takarazuka Revue, which are supported by fans of the troupe, these musicals mainly draw anime and manga fans and other audiences that usually do not see plays on a regular basis.&lt;ref name="japanbullet1"/&gt;

The term "2.5D musicals" was codified in 2014 when the initial director of ''[[Tenimyu|Musical: The Prince of Tennis]]'', Makoto Matsuda, first established the Japan 2.5-Dimensional Musical Association. At first, despite the success of ''[[Tenimyu|Musical: The Prince of Tennis]]'', he did not consider it a formal stage production on par with most modern theater performances imported from Western works such as [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions.&lt;ref name="interview1"/&gt; However, after a group of South Korean musical professionals had acknowledged ''[[Black Butler]]'''s production value and standards in performing arts, Matsuda decided to bring the genre worldwide. Plays certified by the Japan 2.5-Dimensional Musical Association offer theater glasses that contain subtitles in Chinese and English for people who do not speak Japanese.&lt;ref name="webjapan1"/&gt; Starting in 2014, many 2.5D musicals have also been performed abroad in places like China, Taiwan, the United States, and parts of Europe.

In 2018, "2.5D Musical Studies" was added as a program at the Tokyo School of Anime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Jennifer Sherman | url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2017-02-27/anime-focused-2.5d-musical-school-opens-in-tokyo-in-2018/.112521 | title=Anime-Focused 2.5D Musical School Opens in Tokyo in 2018 | work=[[Anime News Network]] | date=2017-02-27 | accessdate=2018-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, actor [[Kenta Suga]], who has starred as Gaara in ''[[Naruto]]'' and Hinata in ''[[Haikyu!!|Hyper Projection Engeki Haikyu!!]]'' became appointed as the overseas ambassador by the Japan 2.5-Dimensional Musical Association, succeeding [[Ryo Kato]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://enterstage.jp/news/2018/04/009321.html | title=須賀健太「2.5Dアンバサダー」就任！白衣姿で2.5次元ミュージカルの魅力を伝える | work=Enterstage | language=Japanese |date=2018-04-18 | accessdate=2018-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''barker''' also known as a carnival barker was a person who attempted to attract patrons to entertainment events, such as a [[circus]] or [[funfair]], by exhorting passing public,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=barker definition - Dictionary - MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/barker.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwPsqBaD?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/barker.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; describing attractions of show and emphasizing variety, novelty, beauty, or some other feature believed to incite listeners to attend entertainment. A barker would often conduct a brief free show, introducing performers and describing acts to be given at the feature performance. Professional barkers strongly disliked the term and instead referred to themselves as "talkers". {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Perhaps the most famous fictional barkers are Billy Bigelow, the protagonist of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s  classic stage musical ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'', and [[Tin Woodman|Tin Man]], a supporting protagonist from the [[1978 in film|1978]] musical film ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]'' portrayed by [[Nipsey Russell]]. Bigelow, in turn was an Americanized version of Liliom, the protagonist of Hungarian author [[Ferenc Molnár]]'s non-musical play ''[[Liliom]]'', on which ''Carousel'' is based.

==In popular culture==
Also the film ''[[The Barker]]'' from 1928 stands for this profession.

==Notable casting couch remarks and incidents==
===United States===
* The legend of the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] casting couch coincided with the rise of the [[studio system]] in the 1910s. Several [[media mogul|mogul]] producers were rumoured to have been enthusiastic practitioners, and it has been claimed that many actresses attempted, with varying degrees of success, to attain stardom via this route.&lt;ref&gt;Freedland, Michael (2009) ''The Men Who Made Hollywood: The Lives of the Great Movie Moguls'', London: Aurum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Gil Troy |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-casting-couch-perverts-who-peddled-fairy-tales |title=The Casting Couch Perverts Who Peddled Fairy Tales |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=2017-10-15 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/19/moguls-and-starlets-100-years-of-hollywoods-corrosive-systemic-sexism |title=Moguls and starlets: 100 years of Hollywood’s corrosive, systemic sexism |work=Guardian |accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1945, [[Maureen O'Hara]] was quoted as saying, "I don't let the producer and director kiss me every morning or let them paw me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://indy100.com/article/hollywood-sexual-harrassment-in-1945-reshared-8038396 |title=Maureen O'Hara's comment about sexual harassment in Hollywood from 1945 is going viral |work=Indy100 |date=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, she repeated: "I wouldn't throw myself on the casting couch, and I know that cost me parts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/oscars/11210734/Maureen-OHara-I-wasnt-going-to-play-the-whore.html |title=Maureen O'Hara: I wasn't going to play the whore |work=Indy100 |date=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a 1996 interview, actor [[Woody Harrelson]] declared "every [acting] business I ever entered into in [[New York City|New York]] seemed to have a casting couch&amp;nbsp;... I've seen so many people sleep with people they loathe in order to further their ambition."&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Mansfield, "Wild and Woody", ''Chicago Sun-Times'', July 5, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;
* At a 2005 class reunion, producer [[Chris Hanley]] told his former classmates that "almost every leading actress in all of [his] 24 films has slept with a director or producer or a leading actor to get the part that launched her career".&lt;ref&gt;"News from the casting couch", ''Chicago Sun-Times'', June 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2006, a New York City producer was accused of sexually harassing several members of the cast of the [[off-Broadway]] play ''[[Dog Sees God: Confessions of a Teenage Blockhead]]''. She had previously been accused of harassing actors [[Gabriel Byrne]], [[Aidan Quinn]], [[Esai Morales]] and [[Joey McIntyre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/19/gender.arts |title=Turning tables on the casting couch |work=[[The Observer]] |date=19 February 2006 |accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2017, [[Lance Bass]] of 'N Sync wrote that "as a society, we've been become far too comfortable with the pervasive 'casting couch' adage that it no longer resembles what it truly is—sexual assault. ... I grew up in the entertainment business and I've experienced my share of unwanted advances from both men and women who saw me as a target."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/lance-bass-sexual-harassment-hollywood-entertainment-business-1202605932/ |title=Lance Bass Opens Up About Unwanted Advances ‘From Both Men and Women’ |work=Variety |date=November 2017 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2009, [[Megan Fox]] stated that "Any casting couch shit I've experienced has been since I've become famous. It's really so heartbreaking. Some of these people! Like Hollywood legends. You think you're going to meet them and you're so excited, like, 'I can't believe this person wants to have a conversation with me,' and you get there and you realise that's not what they want, at all. It's happened a lot this year actually."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.express.co.uk/celebrity-news/105710/Fox-slams-casting-couch-directors |title=Fox slams 'casting couch' directors |work=Express |date=5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In a 2009 interview, actor [[Mickey Rourke]] declared: "There's definitely something called a casting couch... if you take a girl from the Midwest with a pretty face and instead of inviting them in for an [[audition]] in the morning, the directors invite them for dinner at night? ... I can recall with certain women, we'd go out, I'd park the car on Sunset and by the time I'd got to the curb there'd be three or four producers handing them cards. ...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1296">'''Casting television''' is a competition [[television program]] where the winner wins a recording contract, or takes part in a competition.

== Slovakia ==

Slovakia's competition is Superstars, and the prize is a car, cash and recording contracts. Stars such as [[Zdenka Predna]] came to prominence this way.

== United Kingdom ==

Simon Cowell's "Popstars" is perhaps the most famous one of the lot, and other shows on a similar focus are ''[[Stars in Their Eyes]]'', and Andrew Lloyd Webber's ''[[How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?]]''.

== United States ==
Following directly on the UK template is the ''[[American Idol]]'' competition.

== Republic of Ireland ==

Ireland's version, called ''[[You're a Star]]'', had a unique twist: winners came into the Eurovision Song Contest as the prize.  However, after the disaster of the [[McCall Twins]] that format has been abandoned. The most famous winner and most successful in Eurovision (though he did not win) was [[Mickey Joe Harte]].

'''Central Park of Culture and Leisure named after Shcherbakov''' is a [[park|recreation park]] in [[Donetsk]]. It is located in [[Voroshylovskyi Raion]], in the west it matches with [[Shakhtar Stadium (Donetsk)|stadium Shakhtar]], and in the north there is the Second city [[pond]].

Park was open in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alldonetsk.info/en/central-recreation-park-shcherbakova-donetsk|title=The central recreation park of A.S. ShCherbakova in Donetsk - Donetsk: Information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are [[rides]], [[playgrounds]], alleys for hiking and other recreational facilities available for visitors.
The park is named after [[Alexander Shcherbakov|Alexander Sergeevich Shcherbakov]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrainehotelsonline.com/en/travel-Parks-Donetsk-Shcherbakova-Park/Shcherbakova-Park-Donetsk.html|title=Shcherbakova Park in Donetsk, photo and description Shcherbakova Park attraction of Donetsk, excursions to Shcherbakova Park, entertainment in Donetsk, Shcherbakova Park - the main attraction of Donetsk|first=Ukraine Hotels|last=Online|website=www.ukrainehotelsonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was the Secretary of the Donetsk Oblast Party Committee in 1938. However, the original name was different – at first the park was named after [[Pavel Postyshev|Pavel Petrovich Postyshev]], but the park was renamed after the last had been arrested.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infodon.org.ua/donetsk/139|title=Парк им. Щербакова в Донецке - Донецк: история, события, факты - Сайт о Донецке и его истории|website=infodon.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of the park==
The park is located in Skoromoshnaya [[gully]], which was the meeting place for workers of [[Yuzovsky metallurgical plant]] and the nearby [[coal mines]] in the 19th century. A [[travelling circus]] stayed here and mass celebrations were held. In 1891 the river was blocked by a dam, resulting in a first city pond that provided the steel works with water. In 1931 they decided to create a  park, and in September 1932  10 000 [[Komsomol]] members and the city [[pioneer movement|pioneers]] started work on park creation. 120 hectares of the open steppe land area near river Bakhmutka (First city pond) in the Skomoroshnaya gully was allocated for the park.
In 1933 the alleys were established lined with [[chestnut tree]]s, [[lime tree]]s and [[Populus|poplar]]s. On opening day about sixty thousand people visited the park. [[Amusement rides]] started functioning in 1934. Later, the area of the park was increased to 200 hectares, yet reduced to 96 hectares by 2000. At the initial planning except the Central Park there were separate functional zones: a Central Beach park, Amusement park, Regional Park "Medium Ponds", landscape park "Urban forest" and the "Upper" landscape park. The park is located along the coastline of connected ponds, and landscape compositions, most open to the water area direction. In the center the terraces are situated, the lowest of which is the [[parterre]], which is the basis of the composition. The [[Shakhtar Stadium (Donetsk)|stadium Shakhtar]] is built on the upper terrace in 1936 (designed by architects Georgy Nawrocki and S. Severin). In 1932 the park held an agricultural exhibition, for which [[pavilions]] were built. Before 2008 entrance to the park from Stadionnaya street looked like a group of [[columns]] with [[cornices]]; in 2008 it was decorated with ornate metal gates and became a major entrance. In the postwar period in the park there were about a hundred names of [[tree]] and [[Shrub|shrub species]], and the 1955 edition "Donbass Parks" referred to Shcherbakov park as to one of the best parks in Donbas. On November 15, 2008 Donetsk [[journalists]] established "Alley of Journalists". In 2006 reconstruction of the large park started, "Donetskproekt" fulfilled the pre-design for improvement of the waterfront in the park. During the reconstruction the pond embankment was reinforced and purged. In 2008 forged pavilion was established in the park and [[rosary]] with variety of roses was made.

==Sculptures==
The sculptural decoration of the park of the Soviet times was ideology-determined. White statue of [[Joseph Stalin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infodon.org.ua/donetsk/167|title=Парк культуры имени отдыха (товарища Щербакова) - Донецк: история, события, факты - Сайт о Донецке и его истории|website=infodon.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established in front of the bridge framed in acacia and dominated over the whole complex of the central park. Behind the back of Stalin statue there was a sculpture of athlete jumping into the water and the fountain with athletes' sculptures who were holding a vase in outstretched hands.  In the fountain bowl there was a sculpture of a Sportswoman with ball.  Stadium "Shakhtar" was decorated with monumental sculptures on the second floor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infodon.org.ua/stalino/142|title=Архитектура довоенного Сталино - Донецк: история, события, факты - Сайт о Донецке и его истории|website=infodon.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculptures of the postwar period were dismantled in 1970 during reconstruction of the central part of the park. During the renovation of the park in 2006-2008, a statue of the ancient girl with a [[jar]] was placed on the banking of the "First" pond. Also in 2008, in order to commemorate the City and the Miner's Day the "Good Angel of Peace" was established in the Park as international symbol of [[patronage]]. On the statue basis the names of famous [[krainians|Ukrainian]] [[Patrón|patrons]] are carved: [[Nickolay Tereshchenko]], [[Bogdan Khanenko]], [[Vasiliy Tarnovskiy]], [[Rinat Akhmetov]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ostro.org/regions/34/society/news/article-48369/print.html Остров&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330131552/http://www.ostro.org/regions/34/society/news/article-48369/print.html |date=March 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosbalt.ru/ukraina/2008/09/01/519234.html|title=В Донецке русские художники золотом написали имя Ахметова|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, 46 wooden sculptures depicting fantasy characters were established in the Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kp.ua/daily/130808/51296/ В парке им.

==Fountains==
The fountain with athletes sculptures was dismantled in 1970 during reconstruction of the central part of the park,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; and replaced by a fountain, surrounded by a [[parapet]]. A cascade of fountains was organized from the central area to the bridge.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Fountains of the 1970s were dismantled in the 2000s (decade). In 2007 a new fountain, consisting of 6 cups, lined with marble was open in the park. 200 lights are used in the fountain construction. During the renovation of the Park in 2006 - 2008 at the entrance from Stadionnaya street a new fountain was installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://donetsk.mycityua.com/city/2008/04/18/110200.html |accessdate=August 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331030957/http://donetsk.mycityua.com/city/2008/04/18/110200.html |archivedate=March 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attractions==
Children's Railway named after Kirov was launched on November 24, 1936. The [[train]] consisted of two coupled together [[trams]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dzd-ussr.ru/towns/donezk/|title=Донецк. Детская железная дорога|website=www.dzd-ussr.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the road line length was of about one kilometer. Due to the [[World War II]] outbreak, Kirov Children's Railway ceased to exist and was never rebuilt. The park also previously had a musical shell, a summer theater for 1000 spectators,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; "Green" summer cinema for 2,200 seats, a [[Performance surface|dance floor]], a [[restaurant]], [[parachute]] tower (existed until 1970), reading, [[chess]] and [[checkers]] pavilions.

==Films==
===First adaptation: ''Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory'' (1971)===
{{main|Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory}}
''Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory'' is a 1971 [[Musical film|musical]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Tim Dirks | title=Musicals–Dance Films | url=http://www.filmsite.org/musicalfilms5.html | work=AMC Filmsite| accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[film adaptation]] of the 1964 novel ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' by Roald Dahl. It was directed by [[Mel Stuart]], and starred [[Gene Wilder]] as Wonka. The film tells the story of Charlie Bucket as he receives a golden ticket and visits Willy Wonka's chocolate factory with four other children from around the world. Filming took place in [[Munich]] in 1970, and the film was released on June 30, 1971. It received positive reviews, but it was a [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]] despite the fact that it recouped its budget. However, it developed into a [[cult film]] due to its repeated television airings and home video sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/54174|title=Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory|website=AFI Catalog of Feature Films|accessdate=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|author1=Kara K.

===Second adaptation: ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' (2005)===
{{main|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)}}
''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' is a 2005 [[film adaptation]] of the 1964 [[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory|book of the same name]] by [[Roald Dahl]]. The film was directed by [[Tim Burton]]. The film stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as Charlie Bucket and [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Willy Wonka]]. The storyline concerns Charlie, who takes a tour he has won, led by Wonka, through the most magnificent chocolate factory in the world. Development for another adaptation of ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'', filmed previously as ''[[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]]'', began in 1991, 20 years after the first film version, which resulted in [[Warner Bros.]] providing the Dahl Estate with total [[artistic control]]. Prior to Burton's involvement, directors such as [[Gary Ross]], [[Rob Minkoff]], [[Martin Scorsese]] and [[Tom Shadyac]] had been involved, while Warner Bros. either considered or discussed the role of Willy Wonka with [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Will Smith]] and [[Adam Sandler]]. Burton immediately brought regular collaborators Johnny Depp and [[Danny Elfman]] aboard. ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' represents the first time since ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' that Elfman contributed to the film score using written songs and his vocals. Filming took place from June to December 2004 at [[Pinewood Studios]] in the [[United Kingdom]], where Burton avoided using digital effects as much as possible. ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' was released to critical praise and was a box office success, grossing approximately $475 million worldwide, but received mixed to negative reviews when compared with the original 1971 film.

===Cartoon partial adaptation: ''Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'' (2017)===
{{main|Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory}}
A direct-to-video animated crossover film adaptation starring  [[Tom and Jerry]], entitled ''Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'', was released in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs-tu4fi4zA|publisher=Movieclips Extra|accessdate= 3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stars JP Karliak as Willy Wonka and is dedicated to [[Gene Wilder]], who died less than a year before the release.

===''Willy Wonka's Adventures in Loompaland'' (2020)===
In October 2016 it was confirmed that Warner Bros are planning a prequel film depicting Willy Wonka's "early adventures" prior to the events depicted in the books and films.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/willy-wonka-new-film-david-heyman-warner-bros-1201894143/|title='Willy Wonka' New Film in the Works from David Heyman and Warner Bros.

There are two ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' video games, one made in 1985 and another in 2005. The games are based on the book of the same name.

==Ride==
{{main|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory: The Ride}}
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory: The Ride is a [[dark ride]] located in the Cloud Cuckoo Land area of [[Alton Towers]] theme park, [[Staffordshire]], [[England]]. It is based upon the famous [[Roald Dahl]] [[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory|book of the same name]], and takes its thematic inspiration from the illustrations of [[Quentin Blake]]. The ride is split into two segments, the first being a [[Water ride|boat ride]] along the chocolate river inside [[Willy Wonka]]'s Chocolate Factory. Passengers encounter all the characters from the book (going from Augustus Gloop to Veruca Salt) either as simple animatronics or CGI projections. After disembarking the boats the second segment begins with a short pre-show video (involving Mike Teevee). The video is presented as if the viewers are actually trapped within the TV set. The ride continues inside one of two 'Great Glass Elevators' which simulate passengers taking an airborne trip through the rest of the factory. Each elevator is a static room with semi-translucent walls and ceiling on which CGI animations are projected from the outside, and only the floor trembles slightly to give the impression of movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/jul/08/familyholidays.family|title=Alton Towers Theme Park, Staffordshire|work=The Guardian|date=8 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''clown''' is a comic [[performer]] who employs [[slapstick]] or similar types of [[physical comedy]], often in a [[mime artist|mime]] style.

== History ==
[[File:1954 Episode of the TV series "Super Circus".ogg|thumb|left|Video of a 1954 episode of the ''[[Super Circus]]'' show.]]

Clowns have a varied tradition with significant variations in costume and performance. The most recognisable modern clown character is the ''[[Circus clown#The auguste|Auguste]]'' or "red clown" type, with outlandish costumes featuring distinctive makeup, colourful wigs, [[exaggerated]] footwear, and colourful clothing. Their entertainment style is generally designed to entertain large audiences. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Modern clowns are strongly associated with the tradition of the [[circus clown]], which developed out of earlier comedic roles in theatre or ''Varieté'' shows during the 19th to mid 20th centuries.

Many circus clowns have become well known and are a key circus act in their own right. The first mainstream clown role was portrayed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] (who also created the traditional whiteface make-up design). In the early 1800s, he expanded the role of [[Harlequinade#Clown|Clown]] in the [[harlequinade]] that formed part of British [[pantomime]]s, notably at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] and the [[Sadler's Wells]] and [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] theatres. He became so dominant on the London comic stage that harlequinade Clowns became known as "Joey", and both the nickname and Grimaldi's whiteface make-up design were, and still are, used by other types of clowns.

The [[comedy]] that clowns perform is usually in the role of a fool whose everyday actions and tasks become extraordinary—and for whom the ridiculous, for a short while, becomes ordinary. This style of comedy has a long history in many countries and cultures across the world. Some writers have argued that due to the widespread use of such comedy and its long history it is a need that is part of the human condition. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The "fear of clowns," circus clowns in particular as a psychiatric condition has become known by the term [[coulrophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Crosswell |first=Julia |contribution=clown |title=Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins |edition={{subscription}} online |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t292.e1047 |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin ===
The "''clown''" character developed out of the [[zanni]] "''rustic fool''" characters of the early modern [[commedia dell'arte]], which were themselves directly based on the "''rustic fool''" characters of ancient [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]].
Rustic buffoon characters in Classical Greek theater were known as '' sklêro-paiktês'' (from ''paizein'' "to play (like a child)") or ''deikeliktas'', besides other generic terms for "rustic" or "peasant". In Roman theater, a term for clown was ''fossor'', literally "digger; labourer".

The English word ''[[:wikt:clown|clown]]'' was first recorded c. 1560 (as ''clowne,  cloyne'') in the generic meaning  "rustic, boor, peasant". 
The origin of the word is uncertain, perhaps from a Scandinavian word cognate with ''clumsy''.&lt;ref&gt;Icelandic ''klunni'', Swedish ''kluns'' "clumsy, boorish person";  c.f. North Frisian  ''klönne'' and "kluns", also meaning "clumsy person". An alternative proposal derives ''clown'' from Latin ''colonus'' "colonist, farmer".
The verb ''to clown''  "to play the clown onstage" is from about 1600. {{cite web|title=Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=clown&amp;searchmode=none|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is in this sense that "Clown" is used as the name of [[Shakespearean fool|fool characters]] in Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'' and ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''.
The sense of ''clown'' as referring to a professional or habitual fool or jester developed soon after 1600, based on [[Elizabethan theater|Elizabethan]] "rustic fool" characters such as Shakespeare's.

The [[harlequinade]] developed in England in the 17th century, inspired by the commedia dell'arte. It was here that "Clown" came into use as the given name of a stock character. Originally a foil for [[Harlequin]]'s slyness and adroit nature, Clown was a buffoon or bumpkin fool who resembled less a jester than a comical idiot. He was a lower class character dressed in tattered servants' garb.

The now-classical features of the clown character were developed in the early 1800s by [[Joseph Grimaldi]], who played Clown in [[Charles Dibdin the younger|Charles Dibdin's]] 1800 pantomime ''Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World'' at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]], where Grimaldi built the character up into the central figure of the harlequinade.&lt;ref name=Neville6&gt;Neville, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilkins&gt;McConnell Stott, pp. 95–100&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern circus clown ===
{{main article|Circus clown}}
The [[circus clown]] developed in the 19th century. The modern circus derives from [[Philip Astley]]'s London riding school, which opened in 1768. Astley added a clown to his shows to amuse the spectators between equestrian sequences. American comedian [[George L. Fox (clown)|George L. Fox]] became known for his clown role, directly inspired by Grimaldi, in the 1860s.
[[Tom Belling]] senior (1843–1900) developed the "red clown" or "Auguste" (''Dummer August'') character c. 1870, acting as a foil for the more sophisticated "white clown". Belling worked for [[Circus Renz]] in Vienna. Belling's costume became the template for the modern stock character of circus or children's clown, based on a lower class or "hobo" character, with red nose, white makeup around the eyes and mouth, and oversized clothes and shoes. The clown character as developed by the late 19th century is reflected in [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s 1892 opera ''[[Pagliacci]]'' ("Clowns").
Belling's ''Auguste'' character was further popularized by [[Nicolai Poliakoff]]'s ''Coco'' in the 1920s to 1930s.

The English word ''clown'' was borrowed, along with the circus clown act, into many other languages, such as French ''clown'', Russian (and other Slavic languages) кло́ун, Greek κλόουν, Danish/Norwegian ''klovn'', Romanian ''clovn'' etc.

Italian retains ''Pagliaccio'', a Commedia dell'arte [[zanni]] character,&lt;ref&gt;From ''paglia'', the word for "straw" (after the straw costume of the rustic buffoon character), or from ''bajaccio'' "mocker, scoffer".&lt;/ref&gt; and derivations of the Italian term are found in other Romance languages, such as French ''Paillasse'', Spanish ''payaso'', Catalan/Galician ''pallasso'', Portuguese ''palhaço'', Greek παλιάτσος, Turkish ''palyaço'',   German ''Pajass'' (via French),&lt;ref&gt;Dialectal [https://digital.idiotikon.ch/idtkn/id4.htm#!page/41099/mode/1up Bajass] in ''[[Schweizerisches Idiotikon]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Yiddish פּאַיאַץ  (''payats''), Russian пая́ц.

=== History in 20th-century North America ===
In the early 20th century, with the disappearance of the rustic simpleton or village idiot character of everyday experience, North American circuses developed characters such as the [[tramp]] or [[hobo]]. Examples include [[Marceline Orbes]], who performed at the [[New York Hippodrome|Hippodrome Theater]](1905), [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[The Tramp]]'' (1914), and [[Emmett Kelly]]'s ''Weary Willie'' based on hobos of the Depression era. Another influential tramp character was played by [[Otto Griebling]] during the 1930s to 1950s. [[Red Skelton]]'s Dodo the Clown in ''[[The Clown (1953 film)|The Clown]]'' (1953), depicts the circus clown as a tragicomic stock character, "a funny man with a drinking problem".{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In the United States, [[Bozo the Clown]] was an influential ''Auguste'' character since the late 1950s. ''[[The Bozo Show]]'' premiered in 1960 and appeared nationally on cable television in 1978. [[McDonald's]] derived its mascot clown, [[Ronald McDonald]], from the ''Bozo'' character in the 1960s. [[Willard Scott]], who had played ''Bozo'' during 1959–1962, performed as the mascot in 1963 television spots. The McDonald's trademark application for the character dates to 1967.

Based on the ''Bozo'' template, the US custom of birthday clown, private contractors who offer to perform as clowns at children's parties, developed in the 1960s to 1970s. The strong association of the (''Bozo''-derived) clown character with children's entertainment as it has developed since the 1960s also gave rise to "[[Clown Care]]" or "hospital clowning" in children's hospitals by the mid 1980s. [[Clowns of America International]] (established 1984) and [[World Clown Association]] (established 1987) are associations of semi-professionals and professional performers.

The shift of the ''Auguste'' or "red clown" character from his role as a foil for the white in circus or pantomime shows to a ''Bozo''-derived standalone character in children's entertainment by the 1980s also gave rise to the [[evil clown]] character, the attraction of clowns for small children being based in their fundamentally threatening or frightening nature.&lt;ref&gt;A study by the [[University of Sheffield]] concluded "that clowns are universally disliked by children. Some found them quite frightening and unknowable."{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7189401.stm |title=Health &amp;#124; Hospital clown images 'too scary' |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2011-07-05 }} {{cite news|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-01-16|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7191721.stm|title=Why are clowns scary?|first=Finlo|last=Rohrer}}. The natural dislike of clowns makes them effective in eliciting laughter by releasing tension in acting clumsy or rendering themselves helpless.{{cite journal| last=Durwin| first=Joseph| title=Coulrophobia and the Trickster| journal=Trickster's Way| volume=3| issue=1| publisher=Trinity University| location=San Antonio| date=15 November 2004| url=http://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&amp;context=trickstersway&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.co.uk%2Fscholar%3Fstart%3D20%26q%3Devil%2Bclown%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0%2C5| issn=1538-9030| accessdate=2 January 2013}}{{cite web |url=http://www.trinity.edu/org/tricksters/trixway/current/Vol%203/Vol3_1/Durwin.htm |title=Trinity.edu |publisher=Trinity.edu|accessdate=2011-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624001158/http://www.trinity.edu/org/tricksters/trixway/current/Vol%203/Vol3_1/Durwin.htm |archivedate=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pierrot and Harlequin ===
:''See [[Harlequinade]]''
The classical pairing of the White Clown with Auguste in modern tradition
has a precedent in the pairing of [[Pierrot]] and [[Harlequin]] in the [[Commedia dell'arte]].
Originally, Harlequin's role was that of a light-hearted, nimble and astute servant, paired with the sterner and melancholic Pierrot.

In the 18th-century English [[Harlequinade]], Harlequin was now paired with Clown.
As developed by Joseph Grimaldi around 1800, Clown became the mischievous and brutish foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who became more of a romantic character. The most influential such pair in Victorian England were the Payne Brothers, active during the 1860s and 1870s.

=== White clown and Auguste ===
{{anchor|Auguste}}
[[File:LES ROSSYANN Weisscloun und dummer August.JPG|thumb|left|Les Rossyann. ''White clown'' and clumsy ''Auguste'' from France.]]

The ''white clown'', or ''clown blanc'' from the original French, is a sophisticated character, as opposed to the clumsy auguste.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter, Joel () [https://books.google.com/books?id=avG5rDz3ENUC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139 ''Popular Theatre: A Sourcebook''] p.139&lt;/ref&gt; They are also distinguished as the "sad clown" (blanc) and "happy clown" (auguste).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Danièle |last1=Berton |first2=Jean-Pierre |last2=Simard |year=2007 |title=Création théâtrale: Adaptation, schèmes, traduction |language=French}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=q7FLWMA8MiAC&amp;pg=PA330&amp;lpg=PA330 p.330]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Auguste face base makeup color is a variation of pink, red, or tan rather than white. Features are exaggerated in size, and are typically red and black in color. The mouth is thickly outlined with white (called the muzzle) as are the eyes. Appropriate to the character, the auguste can be dressed in either well-fitted garb or in a costume that does not fit — either oversize or too small is appropriate. Bold colors, large prints or patterns, and suspenders often characterize Auguste costumes.

The auguste character-type is often an anarchist, a joker, or a fool. He is clever and has much lower status than the whiteface. Classically the whiteface character instructs the auguste character to perform his bidding. The auguste has a hard time performing a given task, which leads to funny situations. Sometimes the auguste plays the role of an anarchist and purposefully has trouble following the whiteface's directions. Sometimes the auguste is confused or is foolish and makes errors less deliberately.

The ''contra-auguste'' plays the role of the mediator between the white clown and the auguste character. He has a lower status than the white clown but a higher status than the auguste. He aspires to be more like the white clown and often mimics everything the white clown does to try to gain approval. If there is a contra-auguste character, he often is instructed by the whiteface to correct the auguste when he is doing something wrong.

=== Whiteface makeup ===
{{anchor|Whiteface}}
There are two major types of clowns with "whiteface" makeup:
The classic "white clown" is derived from the [[Pierrot]] character. His makeup is white, usually with facial features such as eyebrows emphasized in black. He is the more intelligent and sophisticated clown, contrasting with the rude or grotesque ''Auguste'' types. [[Francesco Caroli]] and [[Glen Little (clown)|Glenn "Frosty" Little]] are examples of this type.  The second type of whiteface is the buffoonish clown of the ''[[Bozo the Clown|Bozo]]'' type, known as "Comedy" or "Grotesque Whiteface". This type has grotesquely emphasized features, especially a red nose and red mouth, often with partial (mostly red) hair. 
In the comedic partnership of [[Abbott and Costello]], Bud Abbot would have been the classic whiteface and Lou Costello the comedy whiteface or Auguste.&lt;ref&gt;Tiffany McCoy, [http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html Clown Types] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026152528/http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html |date=2015-10-26 }} (2010), citing ''Strutter's Complete Guide to Clown Makeup'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the whiteface clown uses "clown white" makeup to cover the entire face and neck, leaving none of the underlying natural skin visible.&lt;ref name=MCS117-118 /&gt; In the European whiteface makeup, the ears are painted red.

Whiteface makeup was originally designed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] in 1801. He began by painting a white base over his face, neck and chest before adding red triangles on the cheeks, thick eyebrows and large red lips set in a mischievous grin. Grimaldi's design is used by many modern clowns. According to Grimaldi's biographer Andrew McConnell Stott, it was one of the most important theatrical designs of the 1800s.&lt;ref name=MCS117-118&gt;McConnell Stott, pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;

America's first great whiteface clown was stage star [[George L. Fox (clown)|George "G.L." Fox]]. Following English [[Joseph Grimaldi]], Fox popularised the Humpty Dumpty stories throughout the land in the first half of the 19th century in America.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/var1993000449/PP/ "G.L. Fox the original Humpty Dumpty"], Library of Congress (online), accessed 24 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Character clown ===
The character clown adopts an eccentric character of some type, such as a butcher, a baker, a policeman, a housewife or [[hobo]]. Prime examples of this type of clown are the circus tramps [[Otto Griebling]] and [[Emmett Kelly]]. [[Red Skelton]], [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] would all fit the definition of a character clown.

The character clown makeup is a comic slant on the standard human face. Their makeup starts with a flesh tone base and may make use of anything from glasses, mustaches and beards to freckles, warts, big ears or strange haircuts.

==== North American ====
The most prevalent character clown in the American circus is the ''hobo'', ''tramp'' or ''bum'' clown. There are subtle differences in the American character clown types. The primary differences among these clown types is [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]. According to American circus expert [[Hovey Burgess]], they are :
* The Hobo: Migratory and finds work where he travels. Down on his luck but maintains a positive [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]].
* The Tramp: Migratory and does not work where he travels. Down on his [[luck]] and depressed about his situation.
* The Bum: Non-migratory and non-working.

== Clown organizations ==
=== Clowns International ===
Clowns International claims to be the oldest clown society in the world. It was set up in 1946. Apart from being a membership organisation, Clowns International has set up a museum of clown memorabilia and a register of clown make-up. The latter also has a collection of full eggshells decorated as replicas of the specific clown's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egg Gallery|url=http://www.clowns-international.com/index.php/galleries/egg-collection|accessdate=June 16, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907170445/http://clowns-international.com/index.php/galleries/egg-collection|archivedate=September 7, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Clown Association ===
{{main article|World Clown Association}}
The World Clown Association (WCA) is a worldwide organization for clowns, jugglers, magicians, and face painters. It holds an annual convention, mainly in the United States.

=== Clowns of America International ===
{{main article|Clowns of America International}}
Clowns of America International, Inc. (COAI) is a Minnesota-based nonprofit clown arts membership organization which aims "to share, educate, and act as a gathering place for serious minded amateurs, semiprofessionals, and professional clowns".

== Clowning terminology ==

=== Other roles and skills ===
In the circus, a clown might perform other circus roles or skills. Clowns may perform such skills as [[tightrope]], [[juggling]], [[unicycling]], [[MC|Master of Ceremonies]], or ride an animal. Clowns may also "sit in" with the [[orchestra]]. Other circus performers may also temporarily stand in for a clown and perform their skills in clown costume.

=== Frameworks ===
'''Frameworks''' are the general outline of an act that clowns use to help them build out an act.&lt;ref name="simplycircus.com"&gt;{{cite web|archivedate=March 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202950/http://simplycircus.com/circus_dictionary/clowning_framework|url=http://www.simplycircus.com/Circus_Dictionary/Clowning_Framework|website=simplycircus.com|title=Clowning Framework}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frameworks can be loose, including only a general beginning and ending to the act, leaving it up to the clown's creativity to fill in the rest, or at the other extreme a fully developed script that allows very little room for creativity.

'''Shows''' are the overall production that a clown is a part of, it may or may not include elements other than clowning, such as in a circus show. In a circus context, clown shows are typically made up of some combination of Entrées, Side dishes, Clown Stops, Track Gags, Gags and bits.

=== Gags, bits and business ===
* '''Business''' — the individual motions the clown uses, often used to express the clown's character.
* '''Gag''' — very short piece of clown comedy that, when repeated within a "bit" or "routine," may become a ''running gag''. Gags are, loosely, the jokes clowns play on each other. A gag may have a beginning, a middle, and an end — or may not. Gags can also refer to the prop stunts/tricks or the stunts that clowns use, such as a squirting flower.
* '''Bit''' — the clown's sketch or routine, made up of one or more "gags" either worked out and timed before going on stage, or impromptu bits composed of familiar improvisational material.

=== Menu ===
* '''Entrée''' — clowning acts lasting 5–10 minutes. Typically made up of various gags and bits, usually within a clowning framework. Entrées almost always end with a "blow-off" — the comedic ending of a show segment, "bit," "gag," "stunt," or "routine."
* '''Side dish''' — shorter feature act. Side dishes are essentially shorter versions of the "entrée," typically lasting 1–3 minutes. Typically made up of various "gags" and "bits," side dishes are usually within a clowning framework. Side dishes almost always end with a "blow-off."

=== Interludes ===
"Clown Stops" or "interludes" are the brief appearances of clowns in a circus while the props and rigging are changed. These are typically made up of a few ''gags'' or several ''bits''. Clown stops will always have a beginning, a middle, and an end to them, invariably culminating in a blow-off. These are also called "reprises" or "run-ins" by many, and in today's circus they are an art form in themselves. Originally they were bits of "business" usually parodying the act that had preceded it. If for instance there had been a [[tightrope walker]] the reprise would involve two chairs with a piece of rope between and the clown trying to imitate the ''artiste'' by trying to walk between them, with the resulting falls and cascades bringing laughter from the audience. Today, interludes are far more complex, and in many modern shows the clowning is a thread that links the whole show together.

=== Prop stunts ===
Among the more well-known clown stunts are: squirting flower; the "[[Clown car|too-many-clowns-coming-out-of-a-tiny-car]]" stunt; doing just about anything with a [[rubber chicken]], tripping over one's own feet (or an air pocket or imaginary blemish in the floor), or riding any number of ridiculous vehicles or "[[Clown bicycle|clown bikes]]". Individual prop stunts are generally considered individual bits.

In anthropology, the term "clown" has been extended to comparable jester or fool characters in non-Western cultures. A society in which such "clowns" have an important position are termed "[[clown society|clown societies]]", and a "clown" character involved in a religious or ritual capacity is known as a "[[ritual clown]]".

The most ancient "clowns"  have been found in the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt]], around 2400 BC.&lt;ref name="Bala2010"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bala |first=Michael |date=Winter 2010 |jstor=10.1525/jung.2010.4.1.50 |title=The Clown: An Archetypal Self-Journey |journal=[[Jung Journal: Culture &amp; Psyche]] |volume=4 |issue=1 | pages=50–71 |quote=The one who swallows the largest amount of filth with the greatest gusto is most commended by the fraternity and onlookers. |doi=10.1525/jung.2010.4.1.50 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Peter Berger writes that "It seems plausible that folly and fools, like religion and magic, meet some deeply rooted needs in human society".&lt;ref name="BergerP78"&gt;{{Harvnb|Berger|1997|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, clowning is often considered an important part of training as a [[physical theatre|physical performance]] discipline, partly because tricky subject matter can be dealt with, but also because it requires a high level of risk and play in the performer.&lt;ref name="CalleryP64"&gt;{{Harvnb|Callery|2001|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Native American mythology, the [[Trickster]] channels the spirit of the Coyote and becomes a sacred Clown character.  A [[Heyoka]] is an individual in Native cultures who lives outside the constraints of normal cultural roles.  The Heyoka plays the role of a backwards clown, doing everything in reverse.  The Heyoka role is sometimes best filled by a [[Winkte]].

Many native tribes have a history of clowning.
The [[Canadian Clowning]] method developed by [[Richard Pochinko]] and furthered by his former apprentice, [[Sue Morrison]], combines European and Native American clowning techniques.

In this tradition, masks are made of clay while the creator's eyes are closed. A mask is made for each direction of the [[medicine wheel]]. During this process, the clown creates a personal mythology that explores their personal experiences.

[[File:HeathensColdReading.JPG|thumb|A play's inaugural reading held at a [[used bookstore]] in [[Boise, Idaho]]]]

Theatrical '''cold reading''' is reading aloud from a [[Manuscript|script]] or other text with little or no [[rehearsal]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://plays.about.com/od/basics/a/coldread.htm Cold Reading During an Audition - How to Cold Read&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Practice (learning method)|practice]] or study in advance. Sometimes also referred to as '''sight reading,''' it is a technique used by [[actor]]s and other performers in [[theatre]], [[television]], and [[film]] [[Performing arts|performance fields]]. 

Cold readings are common in performance classes, and furthermore are employed frequently in actor [[audition]]s to allow the [[theatrical producer|producer]] or [[playwright]] to get a general idea of the actors' performing capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theactingcorps.com/Site/acting-cold-reading.htm Cold Reading, Acting Techniques - The Acting Corps&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They are also employed by playwrights who need to hear their play read aloud for the first time by actors, and as such they form an initial integral component of the collaborative creative theatrical process, which may or may not include the eventual production of the play itself. (Public performances of cold readings also serve as entertainment in their own right, particularly in the context of [[community theater]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://showbusinessweekly.com/article-1867-free-readings-at-the-public-theater.html Free Readings at The Public Theater&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014121605/http://showbusinessweekly.com/article-1867-free-readings-at-the-public-theater.html |date=2011-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj.com/cranford/index.ssf/2013/05/staged_readings_of_short_plays.html Staged readings of short plays at Cranford Community Center, May 18 | NJ.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and less public readings can serve as creative incubators for more established playwright and theatrical talent during the course of play development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=495909 Way, way off Broadway, stars work without reviews&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;)   Many actors and other performers and [[public speaking|public speakers]] take classes and practice at length to improve the quality of their cold readings.

Cold reading can also be used in conjunction with [[improvisation]]s to gauge a performer's ability to perform new works. A good dramatic cold reader is able to communicate with fluency and clarity and to project speech rhythms and rhymes well. The reader should also be able to bring out the intent, mood and characterization of a piece through appropriate articulation and [[body language]].

A '''comedian''' or '''comic''' is a person who seeks to [[entertainment|entertain]] an audience by making them [[Laughter|laugh]]. This might take many forms including [[Joke|jokes]], satirical observations, [[Amusement|amusing]] situations, acting foolish (as in [[Slapstick|slapstick]]) or employing [[prop comedy]]. A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]]. Other practises include the [[sitcom]], [[sketch comedy]] and [[improvisational theatre|improv]].

A popular saying, variously quoted but generally attributed to [[Ed Wynn]],&lt;ref name=Bartleby&gt;{{cite web|title=Simpson's Contemporary Quotations, 1988|url=http://www.bartleby.com/63/93/8993.html|accessdate=2008-04-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316092036/http://www.bartleby.com/63/93/8993.html|archivedate=2008-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is, "A comic says funny things; a comedian says things funny", which draws a distinction between how much of the [[comedy]] can be attributed to verbal content and how much to acting and persona.

A lot of creative and original comedy is based on surrealism and absurdity. Early pioneers in these comedic forms include [[Spike Milligan]] and [[Monty Python]]. Current examples include [[Vic and Bob]], [[Noel Fielding]] and [[Sam Simmons (comedian)|Sam Simmons]]. Elements of surreal and absurd comedy include the non-sequitur (where language or events do not follow a logical process/sequence), irony (where a message is conveyed in a way contrary to its content) and deadpan performance (in the face of surreal and absurd situations, furthering the absurdity).

Since the 1980s, a new wave of comedy, called [[alternative comedy]], has grown in popularity with more offbeat and experimental style. Alternative comedy was initially inspired by [[punk subculture|punk culture]] and rejected old comedy forms, the establishment and bigoted humour. [[Ben Elton]], [[Rik Mayall]], [[Malcolm Hardee]] and [[Alexi Sayle]] were among the most well-known 1980's alternative comedians. Alternative comedy experienced a revival since around 2010, with [[Stewart Lee]] promoting the liberal, progressive values of the movement and many younger comedians in the UK banding together in groups dedicated to alternative comedy including [[The Alternative Comedy Memorial Society]] and [[Weirdos Comedy Club|the Weirdos Collective]].

Many comics achieve a [[cult following]] while touring famous comedy hubs such as the [[Just for Laughs]] festival in [[Montreal]], the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], and [[Melbourne Comedy Festival]] in [[Australia]]. Often a comic's career advances significantly when they win a notable comedy award, such as the [[Edinburgh Comedy Award]] (formerly the Perrier comedy award). Comics sometimes foray into other areas of entertainment, such as film and television, where they become more widely known; e.g., [[Eddie Izzard]] or [[Ricky Gervais]].  However, a comic's stand-up success does not guarantee a film's critical or box office success.

==History==
===Ancient Greeks===
{{See also|Ancient Greek comedy}}
Comedians can be dated back to 425 BC, when [[Aristophanes]], a comic author and playwright, wrote ancient comedic plays. He wrote 40 comedies, 11 of which survive and are still being performed. Aristophanes' comedy style took the form of [[satyr plays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YhaawA_m9SEC&amp;pg=PR9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Lysistrata | author=Aristophanes | pages=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shakespearean comedy===
{{See also|Shakespearean comedy}}
The English poet and playwright [[William Shakespeare]] wrote many comedies. A Shakespearean comedy is one that has a happy ending, usually involving marriages between the unmarried characters, and a tone and style that is more light-hearted than Shakespeare's other plays.

===Modern era===
[[File:Chaplin The Champion.jpg|thumb|[[Charlie Chaplin]] in the film ''[[The Champion (1915 film)|The Champion]]'', 1915]]

[[Charlie Chaplin]] was the most popular screen comedian of the first half of the 20th century. Chaplin and [[Stan Laurel]] were protégés of [[Fred Karno]], the English theatre impresario of British [[music hall]], and in his biography Laurel stated, "Fred Karno didn't teach Charlie [Chaplin] and me all we know about comedy. He just taught us most of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burton|first1=Alan|title=Pimple, pranks &amp; pratfalls: British film comedy before 1930|date=2000|publisher=Flicks Books|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaplin wrote comedic [[silent films]] such as ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'' and ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]''. His films still have a major impact on comedy in films today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/Departments/hpolscrv/msiegler.htm | title=Charlie Chaplin Biography | date=1 May 2001 | accessdate=2 December 2013 | author=Sigler, Michael S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most popular forms of modern-day comedy is [[stand-up comedy]]. Stand-up comedy is a comic monologue performed by one or more people standing on a stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stand-up+comedy?s=t | title='stand-up comedy' definition | accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bob Hope]] was the most popular stand-up comedian of the 20th century, and also starred in numerous comedy films over a five-decade span.  Other noted stand-up comedians include [[Billy Connolly]], [[George Carlin]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Mort Sahl]], [[Louis CK]] and [[Chris Rock]].

[[Radio]] has been a proving-ground for many comedians. [[Ricky Gervais]] career began at a London radio station called [[XFM]] and [[Chris Morris (satirist)]] began his career at Radio Cambridgeshire. [[The League of Gentlemen]], [[Mitchell and Webb]] and [[The Mighty Boosh]] all transferred to television after broadcasting on [[BBC Radio 4]]. Between 2002 and 2011 [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] used to feature regular shows presented by comedians including [[Phil Jupitus]], [[Stephen Merchant]] and [[Adam &amp; Joe]]. Now BBC radio comedy is mainly available on BBC Radio 4 and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]]. Before television, radio was one of the main ways to enjoy comedy, [[The Goon Show]] and [[Hancock's Half Hour]] being among the most popular early shows.

On television there are comedy talk shows where comedians make fun of current news or popular topics. Such comedians include [[Jay Leno]], [[Conan O'Brien]], [[Graham Norton]], [[Daniel Tosh]], [[Chris Hardwick]], [[Jimmy Fallon]], [[David Letterman]], and [[Chelsea Handler]]. There are sketch comedies, such as [[Kids In The Hall and [[Monty Python]] who created their sketch comedy show ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (a [[BBC]] show that influenced ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''), then there are sitcoms, for example [[Friends]], [[Porridge (TV series)|Porridge]] and [[Father Ted]], as well as popular panel shows like [[QI]], [[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|Spicks and Specks]] and [[8 out of 10 Cats]].

Comedy is increasingly enjoyed online. Comedians with popular long-running podcasts series include [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Richard Herring]] and [[Scott Aukerman]]. Comedians streaming video of their standup include [[Bridget Christie]], [[Louis C.K.]] and [[Daniel Kitson]]. Many comedians publicise their work and build an audience through social media, especially [[Twitter]].

==Jokes==
There are many established formats for jokes. One example is the [[pun]] or double-entendre, where similar words are interchanged. [[The Two Ronnies]] often used puns and double-entendre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12068221 BBC News - Ronnie Corbett Christmas Return]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bec Hill]] and [[Tim Vine]] are examples of current comedians who deploy numerous puns. Jokes based on puns tend to be very quick and easy to digest, which sometimes leads to other joke forms being overlooked, for example in the Funniest Joke of the Fringe awards. Other jokes may rely on confounding an audience's expectations through a misleading setup (known as a 'pull back and reveal' in the UK and a 'leadaway' in the US).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chortle.co.uk/correspondents/2010/09/22/11771/missing_a_trick Chortle - Missing A Trick]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ed Byrne (comedian)|Ed Byrne]] is an example of a comedian who has used this technique.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chortle.co.uk/correspondents/2010/09/22/11771/missing_a_trick Chortle - Missing A Trick]&lt;/ref&gt; Some jokes are based on [[ad absurdum]] extrapolations, for example much of [[Richard Herring]] and [[Ross Noble]]'s standup.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQ9eqdqQLXw Russel Howard's Good News Extra]&lt;/ref&gt;. In [[irony|ironic]] humour there is an intentional mismatch between a message and the form in which it is conveyed (for example the work of [[Danielle Ward]]). Other joke forms include observation (eg. [[Peter Kay]]), whimsy (eg. [[Bill Bailey]]), self-deprecation (eg. [[Daniel Kitson]]) and parody (eg. [[Jennifer Saunders]]).

==Personality traits==
In a January 2014 study, conducted in the ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'',  scientists found that comedians tend to have high levels of [[psychotic]] personality traits. In the study, researchers analyzed 404 male and 119 female comedians from [[Australia]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[United States]]. The participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire designed to measure psychotic traits in healthy people. They found that comedians scored "significantly higher on four types of psychotic characteristics compared to a control group of people who had non-creative jobs." Gordon Claridge, a professor of experimental psychology at the [[University of Oxford]] and leader of the study claimed, "the creative elements needed to produce humor are strikingly similar to those characterizing the cognitive style of people with psychosis—both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder."&lt;ref name=Kelland-Psychotic&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelland|first=Kate|title=Comedians have psychotic personality traits, study finds|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/16/us-comedians-psychotic-idUSBREA0F00M20140116|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, labeling comedians' personality traits as "psychotic" does not mean that individual is a psychopath,&lt;ref name=Seubsaeng-Study&gt;{{cite news|last=Suebsaeng|first=Asawin|title=Study Says Comedians Have Psychotic Personality Traits—Here's What Some Comedians Have To Say About That|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2014/01/study-comedians-psychotic-traits-rob-delaney-steve-hofstetter|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=Mother Jones|date=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooper-White&gt;{{cite news|last=Cooper-White|first=Macrina|title=Comedians Have 'High Levels' Of Psychotic Personality Traits, New Study Shows|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/17/comedians-psychotic-personality-traits_n_4610414.html|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; since [[psychopathy]] is distinct from [[psychosis]], and neither does it mean their behavior is necessarily pathological.

{{Performing arts}}

A '''comedy''' is entertainment consisting of jokes intended to make an audience laugh.&lt;ref name = OED/&gt; For ancient Greeks and Romans a comedy was a stage-play with a happy ending. In the [[Middle Ages]], the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings and a lighter tone. In this sense [[Dante]] used the term in the title of his poem, the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Divina Commedia'').

The phenomena connected with laughter and that which provokes it has been carefully investigated by psychologists and  agreed upon the predominating [[:wikt:characteristic|characteristic]]s are incongruity or contrast in the object, and shock or emotional seizure on the part of the subject. It has also been held that the feeling of superiority is an essential factor: thus [[Thomas Hobbes]] speaks of laughter as a "sudden glory." Modern investigators have paid much attention to the origin both of laughter and of smiling, as well as the development of the "play instinct" and its emotional expression.

Much comedy contains variations on the elements of surprise, incongruity, conflict, repetitiveness, and the effect of [[irony|opposite expectations]], but there are many recognized genres of comedy. [[Satire]] and [[political satire]] use ironic comedy used to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of humor.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

[[Parody]] borrows the form of some popular genre, [[Work of art|artwork]], or [[Written language|text]] but uses certain [[irony|ironic]] changes to critique that form from within (though not necessarily in a condemning way). [[Screwball comedy]] derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters. [[Black comedy]] is defined by dark humor that makes light of so-called dark or [[evil]] elements in human nature. Similarly [[Toilet humor|scatological humor]], [[sexual humor]], and [[race humor]] create comedy by violating [[Convention (norm)|social conventions]] or [[taboo]]s in comedic ways.

A [[comedy of manners]] typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. [[Romantic comedy]] is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms, and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.

== Etymology ==
The word "comedy" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] '''''κωμῳδία''''', which is a compound either of ''[[komos|κῶμος]]'' (revel) or ''κώμη'' (village) and ''ᾠδή'' (singing): it is possible that ''κῶμος'' itself is derived from ''κώμη'', and originally meant a village revel. The adjective "comic" (Greek κωμικός), which strictly means that which relates to comedy is, in modern usage, generally confined to the sense of "laughter-provoking".&lt;ref name="Francis MacDonald Cornford 1934"&gt;Francis MacDonald Cornford, The Origin of Attic Comedy, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; The word came into modern usage through the Latin ''comoedia ''and Italian ''commedia'' and has, over time, passed through various shades of meaning.&lt;ref name = OED&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In ancient [[Greece]], comedy seems to have originated in songs or recitations apropos of fertility festivals or gatherings, or also in making fun at other people or stereotypes. In the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] states that [[comedy]] originated in phallic rituals and festivals of mirth. It is basically an imitation of 'the ridiculous, which is a species of the ugly.' However, [[Aristotle]] taught that comedy is a good thing. It brings forth happiness, which for [[Aristotle]] is the ideal state, the final goal in any activity. He does believe that we humans feel pleasure oftentimes by doing the wrong thing, but he does not necessarily believe that comedy and humor is the wrong thing. It is also not true for [[Aristotle]] that a comedy must involve sexual humor to qualify as a comedy. A comedy is about the fortunate arise of a sympathetic character. A happy ending is all that is required in his opinion. 

On the contrary, the Greek Philosopher [[Plato]] taught that [[comedy]] is a destruction to the self. He believed it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and learning. In [[The Republic (Plato)]], he says that the Guardians of the state should avoid laughter, "for ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent laughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction." Plato says comedy should be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state.

Northrop Frye described the comic [[genre]] as a drama that pits two societies against each other in an amusing [[agon]] or conflict. He depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old", ''The Anatomy of Criticism''. 1957, but this [[dichotomy]] is seldom described as an entirely satisfactory explanation.  A later view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes; in this sense, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse to ruses which engender very dramatic.

[[Image:Skegness4web.jpg|thumb|British seaside donkeys in [[Skegness]], [[Lincolnshire]], used for donkey rides on the beach.]]

'''Donkey rides''' are a traditional feature of [[seaside resort]]s in the [[United Kingdom]]. Children are allowed to ride [[donkey]]s on a sandy [[beach]] for a fee in summer months while on holiday, normally led in groups at walking pace. Typically, the donkeys used to have their names on their [[safety harness|harnesses]] so they could be identified by children and parents alike.

Donkey rides have been available since 1886 in [[Weston Super Mare]] and since 1895 in [[Bridlington]].

The tradition started in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] times, but is now much less popular. It is probable that the donkeys offered to ride on were originally working draught animals in the cockle industries around the coast.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8544">'''Extreme cinema''' is a genre of film distinguished by its use of excessive violence, torture, and sex of extreme nature. The rising popularity of Asian films in the 21st century has contributed to the growth of extreme cinema, although extreme cinema is still considered to be a cult-based genre. Being a relatively new genre, extreme cinema is controversial and widely unaccepted by the mainstream media.&lt;ref&gt;Dirks, Tim. “100 Most Controversial Films of All Time.” ''100 Most Controversial Films of All Time''. Filmsite, n.d. Web. 9 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme cinema films target a specific and small audience group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/project/C6FD3EB5-9542-4A98-B2E1-3F2E834B88FF]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The prehistory of extreme cinema can be traced back to censorship of [[art films]] and advertising tactics for classical [[exploitation films]] to Anglophone markets alongside later liberal representations of sex in the first half of the 20th Century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oqq_CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=extreme+cinema+the+transgressive+rhetoric+of+today's+art+film+culture&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KN46_CS2kK&amp;sig=rYJ7CboAzRRup3nNc7NB502f93Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqzorAjanYAhXMOCYKHeaLAus4ChDoAQhCMAY#v=snippet&amp;q=+salo&amp;f=false|title=Extreme Cinema: The Transgressive Rhetoric of Today's Art Film Culture|first=Mattias|last=Frey|date=15 March 2016|publisher=Rutgers University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "extreme cinema" originated from a “line of Asian films that share a combination of sensational features, such as extreme violence, horror and shocking plots”.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Eunah. “Trauma, excess, and the aesthetics of the affect: the extreme cinemas of Chan-Wook Park.” ''Post Script'' 2014:33. ''Literature Resource Center''. Web. 7 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Extreme cinema is highly criticized and debated by film critics and the general public. There have been debates over the hypersexualization that makes these films a threat to the ‘mainstream’ community standards.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Pett, E. “A New Media Landscape? The BBFC,&amp;nbsp; Extreme Cinema As Cult, And Technological Change.” ''New Review of Film and Television Studies'' 13.1 (2015): 83-99. Scopus. Web. 9 Feb. 2016&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been criticism over the increasing use of violence in modern-day films. Ever since the emergence of slasher-gore films in the ’70s, the rising popularity of extreme cinema has contributed to the casual violence in popular media.&lt;ref&gt;Sapolsky, Barry S., Fred Moliter, and Sarah Luque. “Sex and Violence in Slasher Films: Re-examining the Assumptions.” ''J&amp;MC Quarterl''y 80.1 (2003): 28-38. ''SAGE Journals''. Web. 9 Feb. 2016.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Some criticize the easy exposure and unintended targeting of adolescence by extreme cinema films.&lt;ref&gt;Sargent, James D., Todd F. Hetherton, M. Bridget Ahrens, Madeline A. Dalton, Jennifer J. Tickle, and Michael L. Beach. “Adolescent Exposure to Extremely Violent Movies.” ''Journal of Adolescent Health'' 31.6 (2002): 449-454. ''JAMES MADISON UNIV’s Catalog.'' Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classification and guidelines ===
The [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC) classifies extreme cinema films into an "R18" rating, which is defined as “special and legally restricted classification primarily for explicit works of consenting sex or strong fetish material involving adults.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Fart lighting''', also known as '''pyroflatulence''' or '''flatus ignition''', is the practice of igniting the gases produced by human [[flatulence]], often producing a flame of a blue hue, hence the act being known colloquially as a "'''blue angel'''", "'''blue dart'''", or in [[Australia]], a "'''blue flame'''". The fact that flatus is flammable, and the actual combustion of it through this practice, gives rise to much [[humour|humorous]] derivation. Other colors of flame such as orange and yellow are possible with the color dependent on the mixture of gases formed in the colon. In order to "fire fart", one must have a fart prepared in the anal cavity, and a lighter at the ready. Then they fart onto the lighter.

In 1999 author Jim Dawson observed that fart lighting has been a novelty practice primarily among young men or college students for decades, but is discouraged for its potential for causing injury.&lt;ref name="Who Cut the Cheese?: A Cultural History of the Fart "&gt;{{cite book  | last =Dawson  | first =Jim  | title=Who Cut the Cheese?: A Cultural History of the Fart  | publisher=Ten Speed Press | year=1999  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=G8t8doQHi-MC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=%22fart+lighting%22 | accessdate=2007-10-07  | isbn =9781580080118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such experiments typically occur on camping trips and in single-sex group residences, such as tree-houses, dormitories, or [[Fraternity and sorority houses|fraternity houses]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/abs/10.1525/sp.2005.52.3.315 U. of California Press Web site] Retrieved October 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of video sharing features online, hundreds of self-produced videos, both documentary as well as spoof, have been posted to sites such as [[YouTube]].

Although there is little [[scientific]] discourse on the [[Combustion|combustive]] properties of [[flatus]], there are many anecdotal accounts of flatus ignition and the activity has increasingly found its way into popular culture with references in [[comic]] routines, [[movies]], and [[television]]; including [[cartoon]]s. In ''Electric Don Quixote: The Definitive Story of Frank Zappa'' author Neil Slaven quotes [[Frank Zappa]] for calling fart lighting "The manly art of fart-burning", and another book quotes the musician Kenny Williams for saying that it demonstrates "[[Gas compression|compression]], [[Making fire|ignition]], [[combustion]] and [[exhaust gas|exhaust]]."&lt;ref name="Electric Don Quixote: The Definitive"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Slaven  | first =Neil  | title=Electric Don Quixote: The Definitive Story of Frank Zappa  | publisher=Omnibus Press  | isbn = 0711994366  | page = 100  | year=2003  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaGs3UTVm1sC  | accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Real Frank Zappa Book"&gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Zappa  | first1 =Frank  | first2= Peter |last2=Occhiogrosso  | title=The Real Frank Zappa Book  | publisher=Simon and Schuster  | isbn = 9780671705725  | page = 85  | year= 1999  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FB0O_HCpBy0C  | accessdate=2008-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
The composition of flatus varies dramatically among individuals. Flatulence produces a mixture of [[gases]] with the following six as major components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Ness|first1=M. M.|last2=Cattau|first2=E. L.|title=Flatulence: pathophysiology and treatment|journal=American Family Physician|date=April 1985|pages=198–208|volume=31 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[carbon dioxide]],
* [[hydrogen]],
* [[hydrogen sulfide]],
* [[methane]],
* [[nitrogen]],
* [[oxygen]].

Methane burns in oxygen forming water and carbon dioxide often producing a blue [[hue]] ([[Heat of combustion|ΔH&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;]] = −891 kJ/mol),&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080318174637/http://ull.chemistry.uakron.edu/erd/chemicals/6001/6744.html Methane&lt;!-- CRAP Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as:

:{{chem|CH|4}}(g) + 2 {{chem|O|2}}(g) → {{chem|CO|2}}(g) + 2 {{chem|H|2|O}}(g)

Hydrogen sulfide also combusts ([[Heat of combustion|ΔH&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;]] = −519 kJ/mol)&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081013120329/http://ull.chemistry.uakron.edu/erd/chemicals/6001/6578.html Hydrogen sulfide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; to

:2 {{chem|H|2|S}}(g) + 3 {{chem|O|2}}(g) → 2 {{chem|SO|2}}(g) + 2 {{chem|H|2|O}}(g)

The odor associated with flatus is due to hydrogen sulfide, [[skatole]], [[indole]], volatile amines and [[short-chain fatty acid]]s. These substances are detectable by olfactory neurons in concentrations as low as 10 parts per billion, hydrogen sulfide being the most detectable.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, M. D. and Bond, J. H. (1978) in Intestinal Gas and Gastrointestinal Disease&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gas production===
Some of the gases are produced by [[bacteria]] which live in [[symbiosis]] within the [[large intestine]]s of humans and other [[mammal]]s. The gases are created as a by-product of the bacteria's [[digestion]] of food into relatively simpler substances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A673508 BBC - h2g2 - Farts and Flatulence&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The oxygen and nitrogen component of flatus can be accounted for by [[aerophagy]], while the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; component results from the reaction of stomach acids ([[HCl]]) with pancreatic bile ([[Sodium bicarbonate|NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]).

A '''film director''' is a person who directs the making of a [[film]]. A film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects and visualizes the [[screenplay]] (or script) while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that [[Goal|vision]]. The director has a key role in choosing the [[cast member]]s, production design, and the creative aspects of [[filmmaking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/average-film-director-salary-per-movie-7732.html|title=The Average Film Director Salary Per Movie|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[European Union law]], the director is viewed as the [[auteur theory|author]] of the film.&lt;ref name="Kamina2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pascal Kamina|title=Film Copyright in the European Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PqJYG9ihusC&amp;pg=PA153|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43338-9|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized, or noticed. Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay within the boundaries of the film's [[budget]].

There are many pathways to becoming a film director. Some film directors started as [[screenwriter]]s, [[cinematographer]]s, [[film editor]]s or actors. Other film directors have attended a film school. Directors use different approaches. Some [[Outline (list)|outline]] a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue, while others control every aspect, and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely. Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners. Some directors edit or appear in their films, or compose the music score for their films.&lt;ref name="career"&gt;{{cite web|title=TV or film director|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/job-profiles/tv-or-film-director|website=National Careers Service|publisher=British Government|accessdate=May 10, 2017|location=[[United Kingdom]]|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibility==
[[File:LondonSmog.jpg|thumb|upright|The film director gives last minute direction to the cast and crew, while filming a [[costume drama]] on location in [[London]].]]
A film director's task is to envisage a way to translate a [[screenplay]] into a fully formed film, and then to realize this vision.&lt;ref name="Film schools"&gt;{{cite web|title=Career Profile Film Director|url=http://filmschools.com/resources/los-angeles-career-profile-film-directorl|accessdate=March 3, 2013}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, they oversee the artistic and technical elements of film production.&lt;ref name="career"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Media College"&gt;{{cite web |title=Employment Film Director|url=http://www.mediacollege.com/employment/film/director.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This entails organizing the [[film crew]] in such a way to achieve their vision of the film.&lt;ref name="Studentpulse"&gt;{{cite web |title=Career snapshot|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/196/career-snapshot-the-film-director-a-human-lens|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=They must work with producers, writers, cast members, crew members, designers and other professionals in order to implement that vision|url=http://www.academicinvest.com/arts-careers/film-studies-careers/film-director-career-guide|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires skills of group leadership, as well as the ability to maintain a singular focus even in the stressful, fast-paced environment of a film set.&lt;ref name="Career Centre"&gt;{{cite web|title=A film director needs...|url=http://www.careercentre.dtwd.wa.gov.au/occupations/Pages/director-film-television-radio-or-stage.aspx|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it is necessary to have an artistic eye to frame shots and to give precise feedback to cast and crew,&lt;ref name="Diploma Guide"&gt;{{cite web |title=Film Director Career|url=http://diplomaguide.com/articles/Film_Director_Career_Summary.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus, excellent communication skills are a must.&lt;ref name="National Career Service"&gt;{{cite web|title=Job Profile|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/tvorfilmdirector.aspx|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the film director depends on the successful cooperation of many different creative individuals with possibly strongly contradicting artistic ideals and visions, he or she also needs to possess conflict resolution skills in order to mediate whenever necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=You have to be a diplomat. You have to marshal a whole load of creative people, who often don't get on with each other, and your job is to stop things turning into a bun-fight. |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/career-planning/getting-job/i-want-your-job-film-director-480500.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013 | location=London |work=The Independent |first=Alex |last=McRae |date=June 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the director ensures that all individuals involved in the film production are working towards an identical vision for the completed film.&lt;ref name="Studentpulse"/&gt; The set of varying challenges he or she has to tackle has been described as "a multi-dimensional jigsaw puzzle with egos and weather thrown in for good measure".&lt;ref name="Directors UK"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Director?|url=http://www.directors.uk.com/about-us/what-director|accessdate=March 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117082526/http://www.directors.uk.com/about-us/what-director|archive-date=2013-01-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It adds to the pressure that the success of a film can influence when and how they will work again, if at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=directors work under a lot of pressure, and most are under constant stress to find their next job.|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/producers-and-directors.htm|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the sole superiors of the director are the [[Film producer|producer(s)]] and the studio that is financing the film.&lt;ref name="Film schools"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Education Portal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Career as a film director|url=http://education-portal.com/career_as_a_film_director.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of a director differs from producers in that producers typically manage the logistics and business operations of the production, whereas the director is tasked with making creative decisions. The director must work within the restrictions of the film's budget&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The director is bound by financial conditions, which however should not hinder him from developing his own artistic signature.|url=http://www.filmschule.de/en/seiten/fdjobprofile.aspx|accessdate=March 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510094913/http://www.filmschule.de/en/seiten/fdjobprofile.aspx|archive-date=2013-05-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the demands of the producer and studio (such as the need to get a particular [[Motion picture rating system|age rating]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Realizing that an NC-17 rating could hurt business (some theaters and newspapers won't show or advertise NC-17 movies), Mr. Verhoeven cut 47 seconds of the most graphic sex and violence|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/16/arts/film-now-starring-on-video-the-director-s-cut.html| work=The New York Times|first=Ann|last=Hornaday|date= May 16, 1993|accessdate =November 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directors also play an important role in [[post-production]]. While the film is still in production, the director sends "[[dailies]]" to the [[Film editing|film editor]] and explains his or her overall vision for the film, allowing the editor to assemble an [[editor's cut]]. In post-production, the director works with the editor to edit the material into the  [[director's cut]]. Well-established directors have the "[[final cut privilege]]", meaning that they have the final say on which edit of the film is released. For other directors, the studio can order further edits without the director's permission.[[File:Steven Spielberg with Chandran Rutnam in Sri Lanka.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|American director [[Steven Spielberg]] with Sri Lankan filmmaker [[Chandran Rutnam]] in Sri Lanka]]

The director is one of the few positions that requires intimate involvement during every stage of film production. Thus, the position of film director is widely considered to be a highly stressful and demanding one.&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;{{cite web |title=Princeton review|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/careers.aspx?cid=65|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that "20-hour days are not unusual".&lt;ref name="Film schools"/&gt; Some directors also take on additional roles, such as producing, writing or editing.

Under [[European Union]] law, the film director is considered the "author" or one of the authors of a film, largely as a result of the influence of [[auteur theory]].&lt;ref name="Kamina2002"/&gt; Auteur theory is a [[film criticism]] concept that holds that a film director's [[film]] reflects the director's personal creative vision, as if they were the primary "auteur" (the [[French language|French]] word for "author").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/auteur-theory|title=auteur theory {{!}} Definition &amp; Directors|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of—and sometimes even because of—the production of the film as part of an industrial process, the auteur's creative voice is distinct enough to shine through studio interference and the collective process.

==Career pathways==
Some film directors started as [[screenwriter]]s, [[film editor]]s or [[actor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Many are experienced actors, editors or writers|url=http://alis.alberta.ca/occinfo/Content/RequestAction.asp?aspAction=GetHTMLProfile&amp;format=html&amp;OCCPRO_ID=71011104|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several American cinematographers have become directors, including [[Barry Sonnenfeld]], originally the Coen brothers' DP; [[Jan de Bont]], cinematographer on films as ''[[Die Hard]]'' and ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', directed ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'' and ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]''. [[Wally Pfister]], cinematographer on [[Christopher Nolan]]'s three Batman films made his directorial debut with ''[[Transcendence (2014 film)|Transcendence]]''. Other film directors have attended a [[film school]] to "get formal training and education in their craft".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Many directors get formal training and education in their craft at a film school.|url=http://education-portal.com/career_as_a_film_director.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Film students generally study the basic skills used in making a film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In the Fiction Film bachelor studio students learn the basic principles, techniques and procedures of film direction and production|url=http://www.sintlukas.be/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=258&amp;Itemid=1108|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes, for example, preparation, shot lists and storyboards, blocking, protocols of dealing with professional actors, and reading scripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classes supporting this area discuss and rehearse: preparation, shot lists and storyboards, blocking, protocols of dealing with professional actors, reading scripts, the construction of film sequence|url=http://www.lfs.org.uk/courses/ma_film_making/directing.php|accessdate=March 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217032729/http://www.lfs.org.uk/courses/ma_film_making/directing.php|archive-date=2013-02-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some film schools are equipped with sound stages and post-production facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=We operate from a purpose-built studio facility in Harrow, with two sound stages, a set construction workshop, and extensive post-production facilities.|url=http://www.westminster.ac.uk/courses/subjects/television-film-and-moving-image/undergraduate-courses/full-time/u09fuftp-ba-honours-film-and-television-production|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides basic technical and logistical skills, students also receive education on the nature of professional relationships that occur during film production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An intrinsic element of the education, alongside the transfer of organizational and technical skills, is to provide the students with insights into social contexts and relationships|url=http://www.filmschule.de/en/seiten/fdprogram.aspx|accessdate=March 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510100634/http://www.filmschule.de/en/seiten/fdprogram.aspx|archive-date=2013-05-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full degree course can be designed for up to five years of studying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The directing studies 5 years of study : a first cycle of 3 years and a second cycle of 2 years.|url= http://www.iad-arts.be/EN/m2e3b1-realisation.html|accessdate= March 3, 2013|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130723142025/http://www.iad-arts.be/EN/m2e3b1-realisation.html|archive-date= 2013-07-23|dead-url= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Future directors usually complete short films during their enrollment.&lt;ref name="Princeton"/&gt; [[The National Film School of Denmark]] has the student's final projects presented on national TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{Video Games}}
A '''gamer''' is a person who [[Player (game)|plays interactive games]], especially [[video games]], tabletop [[role-playing games]], and skill-based [[Card game|card games]], and who plays for usually long periods of time. In some countries, such as the UK, the term "gaming" can also refer to legalized [[gambling]], which can take both traditional [[Tabletop game|tabletop]] and [[Online gambling|digital forms]]. There are many different gamer [[Community|communities]] around the world. Since the advent of the internet, many communities take the form of [[Internet forum]]s or [[YouTube]]/[[Twitch.tv|Twitch]] [[virtual communities]], as well as [[Real life#As distinct from the Internet|in-person]] [[social clubs]].

Those who play video games regularly are split roughly equally between male and female, but men are more likely to call themselves a 'Gamer.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/gaming-and-gamers/|title=Gaming and Gamers|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|date=2015-12-15|website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A female gamer, or gamer girl, is any female who regularly engages in playing video games. According to a study conducted by the Entertainment Software Association in 2009, 40% of the game playing population is female, and women 18 or older comprise 34% of all gamers. Also, the percentage of women playing online had risen to 43%, up 4% from 2004. The same study shows that 48% of game purchasers are female.&lt;ref name="Theesa.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Facts and Figures"/&gt;
According to a 2015 Pew survey, 6% of women in the United States identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men, and 48% of women and 50% of men play video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Duggan |first1=Maeve |title=Who plays video games and identifies as a “gamer” |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/who-plays-video-games-and-identifies-as-a-gamer/ |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=17 September 2018 |date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usage of the term "girl gamer" is controversial. Some critics have advocated use of the label as a [[reappropriation|reappropriated term]], while others see it as nondescriptive or perpetuating the minority position of female gamers. Some critics of the term believe there is no singular definition of a female gamer and that they are as diverse as any other group.&lt;ref name="Heather Barefoot"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/10699-In-Defense-of-the-Casual-Gamer | title=In Defense of the Casual Gamer | publisher=Escapist magazine | date=30 October 2013 | accessdate=9 March 2014 | author=Heather Barefoot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereotypes==
Although men and women play roughly the same number of games, there is a [[stereotype]] that women are not considered ¨True Gamers¨ because they tend to play more [[Casual game|casual games]] which do not require much skill and dedication. This stereotype exists due to the fact that at a professional level, most of the teams competing are composed of men, thus, overshadowing the girl gamers who could compete at the same level but are not able to get the same amount of media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-016-0678-y|title=SpringerLink|last=|first=|date=|website=db16.linccweb.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for games media, games industry analysts, and academics to divide gamers into broad behavioral categories. These categories are sometimes separated by level of dedication to gaming, sometimes by primary type of game played, and sometimes by a combination of those and other factors. There is no general consensus on the definitions or names of these categories, though many attempts have been made to formalize them. An overview of these attempts and their common elements follows.

*''Newbie'': ''[[Newbie]]'', (commonly shortened to "noob", "n00b", or "newb") is a slang term for a [[wikt:novice|novice]] or [[wikt:newcomer|newcomer]] to a certain game, or to gaming in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/dryfoo/Masonry/Misc/welaish.html |title=Masonry on the Internet |publisher=Web.mit.edu |accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/04/23/words-online-gaming-opinions-books-newbs.html|title=Gamer Speak for Newbs|work=Forbes|author=Anna Vander Broek|date=2009-04-23|accessdate=2010-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional gamer===
{{See also|eSports}}
[[Professional]] gamers generally play video games for [[prize]] [[money]] or [[salaries]]. Such individuals usually deeply study the game to master it and usually to play in [[competitions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel Schorn |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/19/60minutes/main1220146.shtml |title='Fatal1ty' article at CBS News |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date=2006-08-06 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pro gamer may also be another type of gamer, such as a hardcore gamer, if he or she meets the additional criteria for that gamer type. In countries of Asia, particularly [[South Korea]] and [[China]], professional gamers and teams are [[sponsorship|sponsored]] by large companies and can earn more than {{USD|link=yes}}100,000 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/7/23/235053/081 |title=A Brief Look At Professional Gaming |publisher=kuro5hin.org |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 [[Major League Gaming]] contracted several ''[[Halo 2]]'' players including [[Tom "Tsquared" Taylor]] and members of [[Team Final Boss]] with $250,000 USD yearly deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/news/mlg-awards-1-75-million-in-contracts-for-top-pro-gamers |title=MLG Awards $1.75 Million in Contracts for Top Pro Gamers (press release)|work=Major League Gaming |date=December 18, 2006 |accessdate=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retrogamer===
{{Main|Retrogaming}}
A retro gamer is a gamer who prefers to play, and often enough collect, [[retro games]]—older video games and [[arcade game]]s. They may also be called ''classic gamers'' or ''[[wikt:old school|old-school]] gamers'', which are terms that are more prevalent in the [[United States]]. The games are played on the original hardware, on modern hardware via [[Video game console emulator|emulation]], or on modern hardware via [[Porting|ports]] or compilations (though those 'in the hobby' tend toward original hardware and emulation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/articles/columns/game/gars-07142004.ars|title=NES Classics: retro gaming, at a price: Page 1|publisher=arstechnica.com|accessdate=2008-04-14|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification in taxonomies===

A number of [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] have been proposed which classify gamer types and the aspects they value in games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Gaymers-Difference-Makes-Video-Players-ebook/dp/B0192KWP06/182-5342459-6520231|title=Gaymers: the Difference a 'Y' Makes: How (and Why) to Make Video Games LGBT Players Care About|last=Nowak|first=Paul S.|date=2015-12-07|publisher=Prince Pocket Press|edition=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bartle taxonomy of player types]] classifies gamers according to their preferred activities within the game:
* [[Achiever]]s, who like to gain points and overall succeed within the game parameters, collecting all rewards and [[game badge]]s.
* [[Explorers]], who like to discover all areas within the game, including [[Secret level|hidden areas]] and [[Glitch|glitches]], and expose all game mechanics.
* Socializers, who prefer to play games for the social aspect, rather than the actual game itself.
* Beaters, who thrive on competition with other players.
* Completionists, who are combinations of the Achiever and Explorer types. They complete every aspect of the game (main story, side quests, achievements) while finding every secret within it.
The [[MDA framework]] describes various aspects of the game regarding the basic rules and actions (''Mechanics''), how they build up during game to develop the [[gameplay]] (''Dynamics''), and what emotional response they convey to the player (''Aesthetics''). The described aesthetics are further classified as Sensation, Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship, Discovery, Expression and Submission. [[Jesse Schell]] extends this classification with Anticipation, [[Schadenfreude]], Gift giving, Humour, Possibility, Pride, Purification, Surprise, Thrill, Perseverance and Wonder, and proposes a number of generalizations of differences between how males and females play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePcYCwAAQBAJ|title=The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses, Second Edition|last=Schell|first=Jesse|date=2015-09-15|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781498759564|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avatar==
{{Main|Avatar (computing)}}
{{See also|Player character}}
An avatar, username, game name, alias, gamer tag, screen name, or handle is a name (usually a [[pseudonym]]) adopted by a video gamer, used as a main preferred identification to the gaming community. Usage of user names is most prevalent in games with [[online multiplayer]] support, or at [[electronic sport]] conventions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Similarly, a ''clan tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a clan. Clans are generally a group of gamers who play together as a team against other clans.  They are most commonly found in online multi-player games in which one team can face off against another.  Clans can also be formed to create loosely based affiliations perhaps by all being fans of the same game or merely gamers who have close personal ties to each other.  A ''team tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a team.  Teams are generally sub-divisions within the same clan and are regarded within gaming circuits as being a purely competitive affiliation.  These gamers are usually in an online league such as the Cyberathlete Amateur League (C.A.L.) and their parent company the Cyberathlete Professional League (C.P.L.) where all grouped players were labeled as teams and not clans.

==Clans and guilds==
A [[Clan (video games)|clan]], squad or [[guild]] is a group of players that form, usually under an informal 'leader' or administrator.  Clans are often formed by gamers with similar interests; many clans or guilds form to connect an 'offline' community that might otherwise be isolated due to geographic, cultural or physical barriers. Some clans are composed of [[E-sports|professional gamers]], who enter competitive tournaments for cash or other prizes; most, however, are simply groups of like-minded players that band together for a mutual purpose (for example, a gaming-related interest or social group).

==Identity==
{{See also|Gamergate controversy}}
The identity of being a gamer is partly self-determination and partly [[performativity]] of characteristics society expects a gamer to embody.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"/&gt; These expectations include not only a high level of dedication to playing games, but also preferences for certain types of games, as well as an interest in game-related paraphernalia like clothing and comic books.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"/&gt; According to [[Graeme Kirkpatrick]], the "true gamer" is concerned first and foremost with [[gameplay]].&lt;ref name="overlandClueless"/&gt; [[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]] founder Alexander Macris says a gamer is an enthusiast with greater dedication to games than just playing them, similar in connotation to "[[cinemaphile]]".&lt;ref name="escapistPublisherNote"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/12223-The-Escapist-Publisher-Issues-Public-Statement-on-Gamergate|last=Macris|first=Alexander|work=The Escapist|title=Publisher's Note: The State of Gaming}}&lt;/ref&gt;
People who play may not identify as gamers because they feel they don't play "enough" to qualify.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"/&gt; Social stigma against games has influenced some women and minorities to distance themselves from the term "gamer", even though they may play regularly.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-shaw/|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=On Not Becoming Gamers: Moving Beyond the Constructed Audience|journal=Ada|issue=2|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newmediaDoYou"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/06/15/1461444811410394|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=Do you identify as a gamer?

In August 2014 began a controversy linked to gamer identity, named [[Gamergate controversy]]. The controversy has been described as a manifestation of a [[culture war]] over cultural diversification, artistic recognition, and social criticism in video games, and over the social identity of gamers.{{cn|date=October 2018}} The [[Gamergate controversy]] concerns issues of [[Sexism in video gaming|sexism]] and [[progressivism]] in video game culture, stemming from a harassment campaign conducted primarily through the use of the [[Twitter]] [[hashtag]] #GamerGate.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Many supporters of Gamergate oppose what they view as the increasing influence of [[feminism]] on video game culture; as a result, Gamergate is often viewed as a right-wing backlash against progressivism.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

===Demographics===
[[File:Hillary Rodham Clinton playing a Nintendo Game Boy video game on the flight from Austin en route to Washington, DC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hillary Clinton]] playing a [[Nintendo Game Boy]] video game on a flight]]
Games are stereotypically associated with young males, but the diversity of the audience has been increasing over time.&lt;ref name="bizNotGender"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2014-10-30-platform-not-gender-drives-gamer-differences-eedar|last=Nofziger|first=Heather|title=Platform, not gender, drives gamer differences
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stereotype exists even among a majority of women who play video games regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/public-debates-about-gaming-and-gamers/|title=2. Public debates about gaming and gamers|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|date=2015-12-15|website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among players using the same category of device (e.g., console or phone), patterns of play are largely the same between men and women. Diversity is driven in part by new hardware platforms.&lt;ref name="bizNotGender"/&gt; Expansion of the audience was catalyzed by [[Nintendo marketing#Demographic shifts|Nintendo's efforts to reach new demographics]].&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"/&gt; Market penetration of [[smartphones]] with gaming capabilities further expanded the audience,&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"/&gt; since in contrast to consoles or high-end PCs, mobile phone gaming requires only devices that non-gamers are likely to already own.&lt;ref name="bizNotGender"/&gt;

While 48% of women in the United States report having played a video game, only 6% identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men who identify as gamers.&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/attitudes-about-video-games/|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|publisher=Pew Research Center|title=Gaming and Gamers}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rises to 9% among women aged 18–29, compared to 33% of men in that age group. Half of female [[Pc game|PC gamers]] in the U.S. consider themselves to be core or hardcore gamers.&lt;ref name="pcgamerFemale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/researchers-find-that-female-pc-gamers-outnumber-males/|title=Researchers find that female PC gamers outnumber males|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="superdataWhyAll"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.superdataresearch.com/blog/why-all-gamers-matter/|title=Why ALL gamers matter — my view as a female games analyst|date=28 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connotations of "gamer" with sexism on the fringe of gaming culture has caused women to be less willing to adopt the label.&lt;ref name="nytimesShunLabel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/technology/personaltech/women-who-play-games-shun-gamer-label.html|last=McPhate|first=Mike|work=The New York Times|title=Women Who Play Games Shun ‘Gamer’ Label}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial minorities responding to Pew Research were more likely to describe themselves as gamers, with 19% of [[hispanics]] identifying as gamers, compared to 11% of [[African-Americans]] and 7% of [[whites]].&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"/&gt; The competitive [[fighting game]] scene is noted as particularly racially diverse and tolerant.&lt;ref name="polygonFightingGame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2014/2/6/5361004/fighting-game-diversity|last=Bowman|first=Rich|work=Polygon|title=Why the Fighting Game Community is Color Blind}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is attributed to its origin in arcades, where competitors met face to face and the barrier to entry was merely a [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]].&lt;ref name="polygonFightingGame"/&gt; Only 4% of those aged 50 and over identified as gamers.&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"/&gt;

===Casualization===
Casualization is a trend in video games towards simpler games appealing to larger audiences, especially women or the elderly.&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sarrazin|first=Vincent|date=October 7, 2011|url=http://www.inaglobal.fr/en/video-games/article/casualisation-video-games|title=The Casualisation of Video Games|work=ina global|publisher=[[Institut national de l'audiovisuel]]|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some developers, hoping to attract a broader audience, simplify or remove aspects of [[gameplay]] in established genres and franchises.&lt;ref name="gamasutraDumbingDown"/&gt; Compared to seminal titles like ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|DOOM]]'', more recent mass-market action games like the [[Call of Duty]] series are less sensitive to player choice or skill, approaching the status of [[interactive movie]]s.&lt;ref name="eurogamerDoom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-07-06-22-years-on-doom-retains-the-ability-to-shock|last=Stewart|first=Keith|work=The Guardian|title=22 years on, Doom retains the ability to shock}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press rarely calls attention to depth or features found in [[retro games]] but missing from new releases.&lt;ref name="gamasutraAmnesiac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/FelipePepe/20141009/227370/Amnesiac_Heroes_Why_are_we_abandoning_gaming_history.php|last=Pepe|first=Felipe|work=Gamasutra|title=Amnesiac Heroes: Why are we abandoning gaming history?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trend towards casual games is decried by some self-identified gamers who emphasize gameplay, meaning the activities that one undertakes in a game.&lt;ref name="overlandClueless"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamestudies.org/1201/articles/kirkpatrick|title=Constitutive tensions of gaming's field: UK gaming magazines and the formation of gaming culture|last=Kirkpatrick|first=Graeme|work=Gamestudies.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Brendan Keogh]], these are inherently masculine activities such as fighting and exerting dominance. He further says that games women prefer are more passive experiences, and male gamers deride the lack of interactivity in these games because of this association with femininity.&lt;ref name="overlandClueless"/&gt; Belying these trends, games including ''[[The Sims]]'' or ''[[Minecraft]]'' have some of the largest audiences in the industry while also being very complex.&lt;ref name="gamasutraDumbingDown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JohnathonSwift/20140110/208440/quotDumbing_downquot.php|last=Swift|first=Johnathon|work=Gamasutra|title=Dumbing down}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joost van Dreunen of SuperData Research, girls who play Minecraft are "just as 'hardcore' as the next guy over who plays ''[[Counter-Strike]]''"&lt;ref name="washpoMoreWomen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/10/17/more-women-play-video-games-than-boys-and-other-surprising-facts-lost-in-the-mess-of-gamergate/|last=Harwell|first=Drew|work=The Washington Post|title=More women play video games than boys, and other surprising facts lost in the mess of Gamergate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreunen says being in control of a game's environment appeals equally to boys and girls.&lt;ref name="washpoMoreWomen"/&gt; [[Leigh Alexander (journalist)|Leigh Alexander]] argued that appealing to women does not necessarily entail reduced difficulty or complexity.&lt;ref name="edgeDumbingDown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/too-many-gamers-think-diversity-means-dumbing-down-its-time-to-forget-that-outmoded-view/ |last=Alexander |first=Leigh |work=Edge |title=Too many gamers think diversity means dumbing down – it’s time to forget that outmoded view |date=August 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713174818/http://www.edge-online.com/features/too-many-gamers-think-diversity-means-dumbing-down-its-time-to-forget-that-outmoded-view/ |archivedate=July 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{original research|date=April 2018}}
{{use mdy dates|date=February 2014}}
In [[show business]], a '''guest appearance''' is the participation of an outsider performer (such as a [[musician]] or [[actor]]) in an event such as a [[music record]] or [[concert]], [[Performance|show]], etc., when the performer does not belong to the regular cast, band or other performing group. In music, such an outside performer is often referred to as a '''guest artist'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Dance Encyclopedia |first1= Anatole |last1= Chujoy |first2= Phyllis Winifred |last2= Manchester |year= 1967 |publisher= [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |page= 434 |chapter= Guest Artist}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[performance art]], the terms '''guest role''' or '''guest star''' are also common, the latter term specifically indicating the guest appearance of a [[celebrity]]. The latter is often also credited as '''special guest star''' or '''special musical guest star''' by some production companies. 

In [[pop music]], guest appearances are often described with the words '''featuring''', '''with''', or '''and'''. It is abbreviated in credit lists as '''feat.''', '''ft.''', '''f/''', or '''f.'''. 

In a [[television series]], a guest star is an actor who appears in one or a few episodes (sometimes an entire [[story arc]]). 

In [[radio]] and [[television shows]], a guest star is a guest on the show who is a celebrity.

==Classical performance arts==
Guest appearances have been known in [[theatre]], [[ballet]], and [[classical music]] for centuries, with guests both from the home country and from abroad. The advent of [[air transport]] has made this practice much more practical and global.&lt;ref name=laine&gt;{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03EFD9163BF935A15754C0A967948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title= The Ballet Star as Guest Artist |first= Barry |last= Laine |authorlink=Barry Laine |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical music, guest [[orchestra conductor]]s are a common practice.

Guest artists should not be confused with touring groups, troupes, orchestra, or even individual artists, although the distinction may be blurred. In the case of touring, their act is independent in itself, while the guest takes part in the act of the resident staff.

The duration of involvement of a guest artist may vary, from separate short-term acts with fees per concert to fixed temporary [[contract]]s for several seasons.

==Contemporary music==
&lt;!--This section is redirected to from [[Guest vocalist]].--&gt;
In the early days of the [[pop music]] industry the [[band (music)|band]]s were relatively stable units, and while guests were not uncommon, they were seldom given credits on album covers. For example, [[Eric Clapton]] was not credited in print for his guitar performance in the release of "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]" of [[the Beatles]]. Still the term "featuring" was used as early as in the July 1954 [[UK Singles Chart]] by "[[The Four Aces]] featuring [[Al Alberts]]" with "[[Three Coins in the Fountain (song)|Three Coins In The Fountain]]" at 5th place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.everyhit.com/ | title=UK Top 40 Hit Database | accessdate=July 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gradually guest appearances have become a fully credited staple of music industry. The custom of guest appearance has become especially prominent in [[rap music]], and this influenced [[rock music]]ians as well.&lt;ref name=aust&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22799180-16947,00.html |title= Voices Find Gilt by Association |first= Mark |last= Edwards |date= November 22, 2007 |work= [[The Australian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To have a guest star on a record, the [[production coordinator]] must obtain permission from the [[record label]] of the guest and make sure that proper credits are delivered to the host record label to be printed on the album cover, often in the form "''Artist name'',  courtesy of ''Record Label name.''" The permission is not always granted and sometimes negotiations may take a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Bobby |last= Borg |year= 2003 |title= The Musician's Handbook: A Practical Guide to Understanding the Music Business |isbn= 0-8230-8357-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for guest appearances==
A common reason for guest appearances is to draw attention to an act by including a celebrity into it. And vice versa, in the fashion-driven environment of show industry, older stars keep themselves in the limelight by associating themselves with emerging stars.&lt;ref name=aust/&gt;

In rap, mutual and multiple guest starring was recognized as a way to diversify the performance.&lt;ref name=aust/&gt;

In theatre and ballet, guest appearances diversify actors' repertory and experience under different choreographers, and give more acting opportunities. Even for established stars prestigious overseas engagements increase their home status. Conversely, a guest star benefits the receiving troupe, bringing new inspiration and technique. Audience would welcome diversity, and theatrical business benefits as well: theatre connoisseurs will come to see the same piece with a new star.&lt;ref name=laine/&gt;

==Drawbacks==
Commercialization of guests policy may also have negative consequences. Local theatres may limit the growth opportunities for their performers in favor of guests. Sometimes rehearsal times are inadequate to fully integrate the home and guest styles. Touring increases physical load on an actor. It is also associated with multiple stress factors: from [[jet lag]]s to close calls due to unanticipated travel delays.&lt;ref name=aust/&gt;

'''Harlem Magicians''' was a [[basketball]] enterprise founded in 1953 by Lon Varnell through his Varnell Enterprises, that was similar in fashion and activities to the basketball entertainment program the [[Harlem Globetrotters]]. The full name of the [[Barnstorm (sports)|barnstorming]] [[basketball]] team was '''The Fabulous Harlem Magicians''' with the main star attraction of the team being [[Marques Haynes]]. Haynes had been a member of the Globetrotters, but had left the team due to a contract dispute to join the Magicians. Other famous players in the team were [[Goose Tatum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://talesofelnora.blogspot.com/2008/12/night-harlem-magicians-came-to-town.html The Night the Harlem Magicians Came to Town]&lt;/ref&gt; Bob "Ergie" Erickson (who once stole the ball from Haynes four times in one game), and [[Ron Cavenall]]. [[Dempsey Hovland]], founder of 20th Century Booking Agency and himself owner of several barnstorming teams was recruited to book the Harlem Magicians' games. 

In late 1961, [[Abe Saperstein]], founder and owner of the Harlem Globetrotters opened a lawsuit against Lon Varnell for alleged violation of Harlem Globetrotters' registered trademarks, "Harlem Globetrotters" and "Magicians of Basketball" by promoting a basketball team known as the "Harlem Magicians". In 1964, the parties settled the litigation by entering a consent decree approved by the District Court for the Southern District of New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openjurist.org/872/f2d/1025/harlem-globetrotters-incorporated-v-harlem-magicians-incorporated Harlem Globetrotters, Incorporated, Plaintiff-Appellee v.

The '''history of theatre''' charts the development of [[theatre]] over the past 2,500 years. While performative elements are present in every society, it is customary to acknowledge a distinction between theatre as an [[art form]] and entertainment and ''theatrical'' or ''performative'' elements in other activities. The history of theatre is primarily concerned with the origin and subsequent development of the theatre as an [[autonomous]] activity. Since [[classical Athens]] in the 6th century BC, vibrant traditions of theatre have flourished in cultures across the world.&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1995), Brockett and Hildy (2003), and Goldhill (1997, 54).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Theatre arose as a performance of ritual activities that did not require initiation on the part of the spectator. This similarity of early theatre to ritual is negatively attested by [[Aristotle]], who in his ''Poetics'' defined theatre in contrast to the performances of [[sacred mysteries]]: theatre did not require the spectator to fast, drink the [[kykeon]], or march in a procession; however theatre did resemble the sacred mysteries in the sense that it brought purification and healing to the spectator by means of a vision, the ''theama''. The physical location of such performances was accordingly named ''theatron''.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' VI, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the historians Oscar Brockett and Franklin Hildy, rituals typically include elements that entertain or give pleasure, such as [[costumes]] and [[masks]] as well as skilled performers. As societies grew more complex, these spectacular elements began to be acted out under non-ritualistic conditions. As this occurred, the first steps towards theatre as an autonomous activity were being taken.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (1968; 10th ed. 2010), ''History of the Theater'' .&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek theatre=== 
[[File:07Epidaurus Theater08.jpg|thumb|right|305px|The best-preserved example of a classical Greek theatre, the Theatre of [[Epidaurus]], has a circular ''orchêstra'' and probably gives the best idea of the original shape of the Athenian theatre, though it dates from the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (2005, 197) and Taplin (2003, 10).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main article|Theatre of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek comedy|Satyr play}}
Greek theatre, most developed in [[classical Athens|Athens]], is the root of the Western tradition; ''theatre'' is in origin a Greek word. It was part of a broader [[culture]] of theatricality and performance in [[classical Greece]] that included [[Athenian festivals|festivals]], [[Religion in ancient Greece|religious rituals]], [[Ancient Greece#Political structure|politics]], [[Ancient Greek law|law]], athletics and gymnastics, [[Music of ancient Greece|music]], [[Ancient Greek literature#Classical and Pre-Classical Antiquity|poetry]], weddings, funerals, and ''[[Symposium|symposia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cartledge (1997, 3, 6), Goldhill (1997, 54) and (1999, 20-xx), and Rehm (1992. 3). Goldhill argues that although activities that form "an integral part of the exercise of citizenship" (such as when "the Athenian citizen speaks in the Assembly, exercises in the gymnasium, sings at the symposium, or courts a boy") each have their "own regime of display and regulation," nevertheless the term "performance" provides "a useful heuristic category to explore the connections and overlaps between these different areas of activity" (1999, 1).&lt;/ref&gt; Participation in the city-state's many festivals—and attendance at the [[Dionysia#City Dionysia|City Dionysia]] as an audience member (or even as a participant in the theatrical productions) in particular—was an important part of [[citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;Pelling (2005, 83).&lt;/ref&gt; Civic participation also involved the evaluation of the [[rhetoric]] of [[orators]] evidenced in performances in the [[Athenian law court (classical period)|law-court]] or [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|political assembly]], both of which were understood as analogous to the theatre and increasingly came to absorb its dramatic vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhill (1999, 25) and Pelling (2005, 83–84).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[theatre of ancient Greece]] consisted of three types of [[drama]]: [[tragedy]], [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], and the [[satyr play]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–19).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tragedy#Greek|Athenian tragedy]]—the oldest surviving form of tragedy—is a type of [[dance]]-drama that formed an important part of the theatrical culture of the city-state.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1995, 441), Cartledge (1997, 3–5), Goldhill (1997, 54), Ley (2007, 206), and Styan (2000, 140). Taxidou notes that "most scholars now call 'Greek' tragedy 'Athenian' tragedy, which is historically correct" (2004, 104).&lt;/ref&gt; Having emerged sometime during the 6th century BC, it flowered during the 5th century BC (from the end of which it began to spread throughout the Greek world) and continued to be popular until the beginning of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 32–33), Brown (1995, 444), and Cartledge (1997, 3–5). Cartledge writes that although [[Classical Athens|Athenians]] of the 4th century judged [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]] "as the nonpareils of the [[genre]], and regularly honoured their plays with revivals, tragedy itself was not merely a 5th-century phenomenon, the product of a short-lived [[Fifth-century Athens|golden age]]. If not attaining the quality and stature of the fifth-century 'classics', original tragedies nonetheless continued to be written and produced and competed with in large numbers throughout the remaining life of the [[Athenian democracy|democracy]]—and beyond it" (1997, 33).&lt;/ref&gt; No tragedies from the 6th century and only 32 of the more than a thousand that were performed in during the 5th century have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15) and Kovacs (2005, 379). We have seven by [[Aeschylus]], seven by [[Sophocles]], and eighteen by [[Euripides]]. In addition, we also have the ''[[Cyclops (play)|Cyclops]]'', a [[satyr play]] by Euripides. Some critics since the 17th century have argued that one of the tragedies that the classical tradition gives as Euripides'—''[[Rhesus (play)|Rhesus]]''—is a 4th-century play by an unknown author; modern scholarship agrees with the classical authorities and ascribes the play to Euripides; see Walton (1997, viii, xix). (This uncertainty accounts for Brockett and Hildy's figure of 31 tragedies rather than 32.)&lt;/ref&gt; We have complete texts [[Extant literature|extant]] by [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15). The theory that ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' was not written by [[Aeschylus]] adds a fourth, anonymous playwright to those whose work survives.&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of tragedy remain obscure, though by the 5th century it was [[institution]]alised in competitions (''[[agon]]'') held as part of festivities celebrating [[Dionysos]] (the [[Family tree of the Greek gods|god]] of [[wine]] and [[fertility]]).&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13–15) and Brown (1995, 441–447).&lt;/ref&gt; As contestants in the City Dionysia's competition (the most prestigious of the festivals to stage drama), playwrights were required to present a [[tetralogy]] of plays (though the individual works were not necessarily connected by story or theme), which usually consisted of three tragedies and one satyr play.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1995, 442) and Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–17). Exceptions to this pattern were made, as with [[Euripides]]' ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'' in 438 BC. There were also separate competitions at the [[Dionysia#City Dionysia|City Dionysia]] for the performance of [[dithyramb]]s and, after 488–7 BC, [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedies]].&lt;/ref&gt; The performance of tragedies at the City Dionysia may have begun as early as 534 BC; official records (''didaskaliai'') begin from 501 BC, when the satyr play was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13, 15) and Brown (1995, 442). Rehm offers the following argument as evidence that tragedy was not institutionalized until 501 BC: "The specific cult honoured at the [[Dionysia#City Dionysia|City Dionysia]] was that of Dionysus Eleuthereus, the god 'having to do with [[Eleutherae]]', a town on the border between [[Boeotia]] and [[Attica]] that had a sanctuary to Dionysus. At some point [[Classical Athens|Athens]] annexed Eleutherae—most likely after the overthrow of the [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratid]] tyranny in 510 and the democratic reforms of [[Cleisthenes]] in 508-07—and the cult-image of Dionysus Eleuthereus was moved to its new home. Athenians re-enacted the incorporation of the god's cult every year in a preliminary rite to the City Dionysia. On the day before the festival proper, the cult-statue was removed from the [[Greek temple|temple]] near the [[theatre of Dionysus]] and taken to a temple on the road to Eleutherae. That evening, after [[Animal sacrifice|sacrifice]] and [[hymn]]s, a torchlight procession carried the statue back to the temple, a symbolic re-creation of the god's arrival into Athens, as well as a reminder of the inclusion of the Boeotian town into Attica. As the name Eleutherae is extremely close to eleutheria, 'freedom', Athenians probably felt that the new cult was particularly appropriate for celebrating their own political liberation and democratic reforms" (1992, 15).&lt;/ref&gt; Most Athenian tragedies dramatise events from [[Greek mythology]], though ''[[The Persians]]''—which stages the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] response to news of their military defeat at the [[Battle of Salamis]] in 480 BC—is the notable exception in the surviving drama.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1995, 442). [[Jean-Pierre Vernant]] argues that in ''[[The Persians]]'' [[Aeschylus]] substitutes for the usual temporal distance between the audience and the [[Greek Heroic Age|age of heroes]] a spatial distance between the Western audience and the Eastern [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian culture]]. This substitution, he suggests, produces a similar effect: "The 'historic' events evoked by the chorus, recounted by the messenger and interpreted by Darius' ghost are presented on stage in a legendary atmosphere. The light that the tragedy sheds upon them is not that in which the political happenings of the day are normally seen; it reaches the Athenian theater refracted from a distant world of elsewhere, making what is absent seem present and visible on the stage"; Vernant and Vidal-Naquet (1988, 245).&lt;/ref&gt; When Aeschylus won first prize for it at the City Dionysia in 472 BC, he had been writing tragedies for more than 25 years, yet its tragic treatment of recent history is the earliest example of drama to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1995, 442) and Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–16).&lt;/ref&gt; More than 130 years later, the philosopher [[Aristotle]] analysed 5th-century Athenian tragedy in the oldest surviving work of [[dramatic theory]]—his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BC). [[Ancient Greek comedy|Athenian comedy]] is conventionally divided into three periods, "Old Comedy", "Middle Comedy", and "New Comedy". Old Comedy survives today largely in the form of the eleven surviving plays of [[Aristophanes]], while Middle Comedy is largely lost (preserved only in relatively short fragments in authors such as [[Athenaeus of Naucratis]]). New Comedy is known primarily from the substantial papyrus fragments of plays by [[Menander]]. Aristotle defined comedy as a representation of laughable people that involves some kind of error or ugliness that does not cause pain or destruction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'': "Comedy is, as we said, a representation of people who are rather inferior—not, however, with respect to every [kind of] vice, but the laughable is [only] a part of what is ugly. For the laughable is a sort of error and ugliness that is not painful and destructive, just as, evidently, a laughable mask is something ugly and distorted without pain" (1449a 30–35); see Janko (1987, 6).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman theatre===
[[File:Orange roman theatre.jpg|right|thumb|305px|Roman theatre at [[Orange, France]]]]
{{Main article|Theatre of ancient Rome}}
Western theatre developed and expanded considerably under the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The Roman historian [[Livy]] wrote that the Romans first experienced theatre in the 4th century BC, with a performance by [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] actors.&lt;ref&gt;Beacham (1996, 2).&lt;/ref&gt; Beacham argues that Romans had been familiar with "pre-theatrical practices" for some time before that recorded contact.&lt;ref&gt;Beacham (1996, 3).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[theatre of ancient Rome]] was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from [[Roman festival|festival]] performances of [[street theatre]], nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of [[Plautus]]'s broadly appealing situation [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]], to the [[high culture|high-style]], verbally elaborate [[Tragedy|tragedies]] of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the [[Hellenization]] of [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] in the 3rd century BC had a profound and energizing effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of [[Latin literature]] of the highest quality for the stage.

Following the expansion of the [[Roman Republic]] (509–27 BC) into several Greek territories between 270–240 BC, Rome encountered [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek drama]].&lt;ref name="h43"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 43).&lt;/ref&gt; From the later years of the republic and by means of the [[Roman Empire]] (27 BC-476 AD), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and reached England; Roman theatre was more varied, extensive and sophisticated than that of any culture before it.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 36, 47).&lt;/ref&gt; While Greek drama continued to be performed throughout the Roman period, the year 240 BC marks the beginning of regular Roman drama.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 43). For more information on the ancient Roman dramatists, see [[:Category:Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights|the articles categorised under "Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights" in Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning of the empire, however, interest in full-length drama declined in favour of a broader variety of theatrical entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 46–47).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first important works of [[Latin literature|Roman literature]] were the [[Tragedy|tragedies]] and [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] that [[Livius Andronicus]] wrote from 240 BC.&lt;ref name="h47"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 47).&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, [[Gnaeus Naevius]] also began to write drama.&lt;ref name="h47"/&gt; No plays from either writer have survived. While both dramatists composed in both [[genres]], Andronicus was most appreciated for his tragedies and Naevius for his comedies; their successors tended to specialise in one or the other, which led to a separation of the subsequent development of each type of drama.&lt;ref name="h47"/&gt; By the beginning of the 2nd century BC, drama was firmly established in Rome and a [[guild]] of writers (''collegium poetarum'') had been formed.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 47–48).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman comedies that have survived are all ''[[fabula palliata]]'' (comedies based on Greek subjects) and come from two dramatists: [[Plautus|Titus Maccius Plautus]] (Plautus) and [[Terence|Publius Terentius Afer]] (Terence).&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 48–49).&lt;/ref&gt; In re-working the Greek originals, the Roman comic dramatists abolished the role of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] in dividing the drama into [[episode]]s and introduced musical accompaniment to its [[dialogue]] (between one-third of the dialogue in the comedies of Plautus and two-thirds in those of Terence).&lt;ref name="h49"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 49).&lt;/ref&gt; The action of all scenes is set in the exterior location of a street and its complications often follow from [[eavesdropping]].&lt;ref name="h49"/&gt; Plautus, the more popular of the two, wrote between 205 and 184 BC and twenty of his comedies survive, of which his [[farce]]s are best known; he was admired for the [[wit]] of his dialogue and his use of a variety of [[Meter (poetry)|poetic meters]].&lt;ref name="h48"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 48).&lt;/ref&gt; All of the six comedies that Terence wrote between 166 and 160 BC have survived; the complexity of his plots, in which he often combined several Greek originals, was sometimes denounced, but his double-plots enabled a sophisticated presentation of contrasting human behaviour.&lt;ref name="h48"/&gt;

No early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three early tragedians—[[Quintus Ennius]], [[Marcus Pacuvius]] and [[Lucius Accius]].&lt;ref name="h49"/&gt; From the time of the empire, the work of two tragedians survives—one is an unknown author, while the other is the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosopher]] [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].&lt;ref name="h50"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 50).&lt;/ref&gt; Nine of Seneca's tragedies survive, all of which are ''fabula crepidata'' (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'', for example, was based on [[Euripides]]' ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 49–50).&lt;/ref&gt; Historians do not know who wrote the only [[Extant literature|extant]] example of the ''fabula praetexta'' (tragedies based on Roman subjects), ''[[Octavia (play)|Octavia]]'', but in former times it was mistakenly attributed to Seneca due to his appearance as a [[Character (arts)|character]] in the tragedy.&lt;ref name="h50"/&gt;

===&lt;big&gt;Transition and early Medieval theatre, 500–1050&lt;/big&gt;===
{{Main article|Medieval theatre}}
As the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell into decay through the 4th and 5th centuries, the seat of Roman power shifted to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] and the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], today called the [[Byzantine Empire]]. While surviving evidence about Byzantine theatre is slight, existing records show that [[mime]], [[pantomime]], scenes or recitations from [[tragedy|tragedies]] and [[comedy|comedies]], [[dance]]s, and other entertainments were very popular. Constantinople had two theatres that were in use as late as the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 70)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the true importance of the Byzantines in theatrical history is their preservation of many classical Greek texts and the compilation of a massive encyclopedia called the [[Suda]], from which is derived a large amount of contemporary information on Greek theatre.

From the 5th century, [[Western Europe]] was plunged into a period of general disorder that lasted (with a brief period of stability under the [[Carolingian Empire]] in the 9th century) until the 10th century. As such, most organized theatrical activities disappeared in [[Western Europe]]. While it seems that small nomadic bands traveled around Europe throughout the period, performing wherever they could find an audience, there is no evidence that they produced anything but crude scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 75)&lt;/ref&gt; These performers were denounced by the [[Catholic Church|Church]] during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] as they were viewed as dangerous and pagan.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{See also|Antitheatricality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roswitha of Gandersheim.jpg|left|200px|thumb|[[Hrosvitha]] of Gandersheim, the first dramatist of the post-classical era.]]

By the [[Early Middle Ages]], churches in [[Europe]] began staging dramatized versions of particular biblical events on specific days of the year. These dramatizations were included in order to vivify annual celebrations.&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,76"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 76)&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolic objects and actions – [[vestments]], [[altar]]s, [[censer]]s, and [[pantomime]] performed by priests – recalled the events which Christian ritual celebrates. These were extensive sets of visual signs that could be used to communicate with a largely illiterate audience. These performances developed into [[liturgical drama]]s, the earliest of which is the ''Whom do you Seek (Quem-Quaeritis)'' Easter trope, dating from ca. 925.&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,76"/&gt; Liturgical drama was sung responsively by two groups and did not involve actors impersonating characters. However, sometime between 965 and 975, [[Æthelwold of Winchester]] composed the ''Regularis Concordia (Monastic Agreement)'' which contains a playlet complete with directions for performance.&lt;ref name="Brockett and Hildy 2003, 77"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 77)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hrosvitha]] (c. 935 – 973), a canoness in northern [[Germany]], wrote six plays modeled on [[Terence]]'s comedies but using religious subjects. These six plays – ''Abraham, Callimachus, Dulcitius, Gallicanus, Paphnutius, ''and ''Sapientia'' – are the first known plays composed by a female dramatist and the first identifiable Western dramatic works of the post-classical era.&lt;ref name="Brockett and Hildy 2003, 77"/&gt; They were first published in 1501 and had considerable influence on religious and didactic plays of the sixteenth century. Hrosvitha was followed by [[Hildegard of Bingen]] (d. 1179), a [[Benedictine]] abbess, who wrote a [[Latin]] [[music]]al drama called ''Ordo Virtutum'' in 1155.

{{Main article|Medieval theatre}}

As the [[Viking]] invasions ceased in the middle of the 11th century, [[liturgical drama]] had spread from [[Russia]] to [[Scandinavia]] to [[Italy]]. Only in [[Al-Andalus|Muslim-occupied Spain]] were liturgical dramas not presented at all. Despite the large number of liturgical dramas that have survived from the period, many churches would have only performed one or two per year and a larger number never performed any at all.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 78)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Feast of Fools]] was especially important in the development of comedy. The festival inverted the status of the lesser clergy and allowed them to ridicule their superiors and the routine of church life. Sometimes plays were staged as part of the occasion and a certain amount of [[burlesque]] and [[comedy]] crept into these performances. Although comic episodes had to truly wait until the separation of drama from the liturgy, the Feast of Fools undoubtedly had a profound effect on the development of comedy in both religious and secular plays.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 81)&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance of religious plays outside of the church began sometime in the 12th century through a traditionally accepted process of merging shorter liturgical dramas into longer plays which were then translated into [[vernacular]] and performed by laymen. ''[[The Play of Adam|The Mystery of Adam]] '' (1150) gives credence to this theory as its detailed stage direction suggest that it was staged outdoors. A number of other plays from the period survive, including ''La Seinte Resurrection'' ([[Normans|Norman]]), ''The Play of the Magi Kings'' ([[Spain|Spanish]]), and ''Sponsus'' ([[France|French]]).

The importance of the [[High Middle Ages]] in the development of theatre was the [[economic]] and [[political]] changes that led to the formation of [[guilds]] and the growth of towns. This would lead to significant changes in the [[Late Middle Ages]]. In the [[British Isles]], plays were produced in some 127 different towns during the Middle Ages. These vernacular [[Mystery plays]] were written in cycles of a large number of plays: [[York Mystery Plays|York]] (48 plays), [[Chester Mystery Plays|Chester]] (24), [[Wakefield Mystery Plays|Wakefield]] (32) and [[N-Town Plays|Unknown]] (42). A larger number of plays survive from [[France]] and [[Germany]] in this period and some type of religious dramas were performed in nearly every European country in the [[Late Middle Ages]]. Many of these plays contained [[comedy]], [[devil]]s, [[villain]]s and [[clown]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 86)&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of actors in these plays were drawn from the local population. For example, at [[Valenciennes]] in 1547, more than 100 roles were assigned to 72 actors.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 95)&lt;/ref&gt; Plays were staged on [[pageant wagon]] stages, which were platforms mounted on wheels used to move scenery. Often providing their own costumes, amateur performers in England were exclusively male, but other countries had female performers. The platform stage, which was an unidentified space and not a specific locale, allowed for abrupt changes in location.

[[Morality plays]] emerged as a distinct dramatic form around 1400 and flourished until 1550. The most interesting morality play is ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]'' which depicts [[Human|mankind]]'s progress from birth to death. However, the most famous morality play and perhaps best known medieval drama is ''[[Everyman]]''. Everyman receives [[Death]]'s summons, struggles to escape and finally resigns himself to necessity. Along the way, he is deserted by [[Kinship|Kindred]], [[Good (economics)|Goods]], and [[Fellow]]ship – only [[Good works|Good Deeds]] goes with him to the grave.

There were also a number of secular performances staged in the Middle Ages, the earliest of which is ''The Play of the Greenwood'' by [[Adam de la Halle]] in 1276. It contains satirical scenes and [[Folk culture|folk]] material such as [[faeries]] and other supernatural occurrences. [[Farce]]s also rose dramatically in popularity after the 13th century. The majority of these plays come from [[France]] and [[Germany]] and are similar in tone and form, emphasizing [[sex]] and bodily excretions.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 96)&lt;/ref&gt; The best known playwright of farces is [[Hans Sachs]] (1494–1576) who wrote 198 dramatic works. In England, [[The Second Shepherds' Play]] of the [[Wakefield Cycle]] is the best known early farce. However, farce did not appear independently in England until the 16th century with the work of [[John Heywood]] (1497–1580).

A significant forerunner of the development of [[Elizabethan]] drama was the [[Chamber of rhetoric|Chambers of Rhetoric]] in the [[Low Countries]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 99)&lt;/ref&gt; These societies were concerned with [[poetry]], [[music]] and [[drama]] and held contests to see which society could compose the best drama in relation to a question posed.

At the end of the [[Late Middle Ages]], professional actors began to appear in [[England]] and [[Europe]]. [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] and [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] both maintained small companies of professional actors. Their plays were performed in the [[Great Hall]] of a nobleman's residence, often with a raised platform at one end for the audience and a "screen" at the other for the actors. Also important were [[Mummers Play|Mummers' plays]], performed during the [[Christmas]] season, and court [[masque]]s. These masques were especially popular during the reign of [[Henry VIII]] who had a House of Revels built and an [[Master of the Revels|Office of Revels]] established in 1545.&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,101-103"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 101–103)&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of medieval drama came about due to a number of factors, including the weakening power of the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the banning of religious plays in many countries. [[Elizabeth I]] forbid all religious plays in 1558 and the great cycle plays had been silenced by the 1580s. Similarly, religious plays were banned in the [[Netherlands]] in 1539, the [[Papal States]] in 1547 and in [[Paris]] in 1548. The abandonment of these plays destroyed the international theatre that had thereto existed and forced each country to develop its own form of drama. It also allowed dramatists to turn to secular subjects and the reviving interest in [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] theatre provided them with the perfect opportunity.&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,101-103"/&gt;

{{Main article|Commedia dell'arte}}
''Commedia dell'arte'' troupes performed lively improvisational playlets across Europe for centuries. It originated in Italy in the 1560s. ''Commedia dell'arte'' was an actor-centred theatre, requiring little scenery and very few props. Plays did not originate from written drama but from scenarios called ''[[lazzi]]'', which were loose frameworks that provided the situations, complications, and outcome of the action, around which the actors would improvise. The plays utilised [[stock character]]s, which could be divided into three groups: the lovers, the masters, and the servants. The lovers had different names and characteristics in most plays and often were the children of the master. The role of master was normally based on one of three stereotypes: [[Pantalone]], an elderly Venetian merchant; [[Dottore]], Pantalone's friend or rival, a [[pedant]]ic doctor or lawyer who acted far more intelligent than he really was; and [[Capitano]], who was once a lover character, but evolved into a [[braggart]] who boasted of his exploits in love and war, but was often terrifically unskilled in both. He normally carried a sword and wore a cape and feathered headdress. The servant character (called ''[[zanni]]'') had only one recurring role: [[Arlecchino]] (also called [[Harlequin]]). He was both cunning and ignorant, but an accomplished dancer and acrobat. He typically carried a wooden stick with a split in the middle so it made a loud noise when striking something. This "weapon" gave us the term "[[slapstick]]".

A troupe typically consisted of 13 to 14 members. Most actors were paid by taking a share of the play's profits roughly equivalent to the size of their role. The style of theatre was in its peak from 1575 to 1650, but even after that time new scenarios were written and performed. The Venetian playwright [[Carlo Goldoni]] wrote a few scenarios starting in 1734, but since he considered the genre too vulgar, he refined the topics of his own to be more sophisticated. He also wrote several plays based on real events, in which he included ''commedia'' characters.

{{Main article|English Renaissance theatre}}
Renaissance theatre derived from several medieval theatre traditions, such as,  the mystery plays that formed a part of religious festivals in England and other parts of Europe during the Middle Ages. Other sources include the "[[morality play]]s" and the "University drama" that attempted to recreate Athenian tragedy. The Italian tradition of ''Commedia dell'arte'', as well as the elaborate [[masque]]s frequently presented at court, also contributed to the shaping of public theatre.

Since before the reign of Elizabeth I, [[Playing company|companies of players]] were attached to households of leading aristocrats and performed seasonally in various locations. These became the foundation for the professional players that performed on the Elizabethan stage. The tours of these players gradually replaced the performances of the mystery and morality plays by local players, and a 1572 law eliminated the remaining companies lacking formal patronage by labelling them [[vagabond (person)|vagabond]]s.

The City of London authorities were generally hostile to public performances, but its hostility was overmatched by the Queen's taste for plays and the Privy Council's support. Theatres sprang up in suburbs, especially in the liberty of Southwark, accessible across the Thames to city dwellers but beyond the authority's control. The companies maintained the pretence that their public performances were mere rehearsals for the frequent performances before the Queen, but while the latter did grant prestige, the former were the real source of the income for the professional players.

Along with the economics of the profession, the character of the drama changed toward the end of the period. Under Elizabeth, the drama was a unified expression as far as social class was concerned: the Court watched the same plays the commoners saw in the public playhouses. With the development of the private theatres, drama became more oriented toward the tastes and values of an upper-class audience. By the later part of the reign of Charles I, few new plays were being written for the public theatres, which sustained themselves on the accumulated works of the previous decades.&lt;ref&gt;Gurr (1992, 12–18).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Puritan]] opposition to the stage (informed by the arguments of the early Church Fathers who had written screeds against the decadent and violent entertainments of the Romans) argued not only that the stage in general was [[pagan]], but that any play that represented a religious figure was inherently [[Idolatry|idolatrous]]. In 1642, at the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]], the Protestant authorities banned the performance of all plays within the city limits of London. A sweeping assault against the alleged immoralities of the theatre crushed whatever remained in England of the dramatic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{See also|Antitheatricality#English Renaissance theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After public stage performances had been banned for 18 years by the Puritan regime, the re-opening of the theatres in 1660 signaled a renaissance of English drama. With the restoration of the monarch in 1660 came the restoration of and the reopening of the theatre. English [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] written and performed in the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period from 1660 to 1710 are collectively called "Restoration comedy". Restoration comedy is notorious for its [[human sexual behavior|sexual]] explicitness, a quality encouraged by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (1660–1685) personally and by the [[rake (character)|rakish]] [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[ethos]] of his [[noble court|court]]. For the first time women were allowed to act, putting an end to the practice of the [[Boy player|boy-player]] taking the parts of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{See also|Antitheatricality#Restoration theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Socially diverse audiences included both aristocrats, their servants and hangers-on, and a substantial middle-class segment. Restoration audiences liked to see good triumph in their tragedies and rightful government restored. In comedy they liked to see the love-lives of the young and fashionable, with a central couple bringing their courtship to a successful conclusion (often overcoming the opposition of the elders to do so). Heroines had to be chaste, but were independent-minded and outspoken; now that they were played by women, there was more mileage for the playwright in disguising them in men's clothes or giving them narrow escape from rape.  These playgoers were attracted to the comedies by up-to-the-minute topical writing, by crowded and bustling [[Plot (narrative)|plots]], by the introduction of the first professional actresses, and by the rise of the first celebrity actors. To non-theatre-goers these comedies were widely seen as licentious and morally suspect, holding up the antics of a small, privileged, and decadent class for admiration. This same class dominated the audiences of the Restoration theatre.  This period saw the first professional woman playwright, [[Aphra Behn]].

As a reaction to the decadence of Charles II era productions, [[sentimental comedy]] grew in popularity. This genre focused on encouraging virtuous behavior by showing middle class characters overcoming a series of moral trials. Playwrights like [[Colley Cibber]] and [[Richard Steele]] believed that humans were inherently good but capable of being led astray. Through plays such as [[The Conscious Lovers]] and [[Love's Last Shift]] they strove to appeal to an audience's noble sentiments in order that viewers could be reformed.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=William|title=Sentimental Comedy in England and on the Continent|url=http://www.bartleby.com/220/0402.html|website=The Cambridge History of English and American Literature|publisher=The Cambridge History of English and American Literature|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harman|first1=William|title=A Handbook to Literature|date=2011|publisher=Longman|isbn=0205024017|edition=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration spectacular===
{{Main article|Restoration spectacular}}
The '''Restoration spectacular''', or elaborately staged "machine play", hit the [[London]] public stage in the late 17th-century [[English Restoration|Restoration]] period, enthralling audiences with action, music, dance, moveable [[theatrical scenery|scenery]], [[baroque illusionistic painting]], gorgeous costumes, and [[special effect]]s such as [[trapdoor]] tricks, "flying" actors, and [[fireworks]]. These shows have always had a bad reputation as a vulgar and commercial threat to the witty, "legitimate" [[Restoration drama]]; however, they drew Londoners in unprecedented numbers and left them dazzled and delighted.

Basically home-grown and with roots in the early 17th-century [[court]] [[masque]], though never ashamed of borrowing ideas and stage technology from [[French opera]], the spectaculars are sometimes called "English opera". However, the variety of them is so untidy that most theatre historians despair of defining them as a [[genre]] at all.&lt;ref&gt;Hume (1976, 205).&lt;/ref&gt; Only a handful of works of this period are usually accorded the term "opera", as the musical dimension of most of them is subordinate to the visual. It was spectacle and scenery that drew in the crowds, as shown by many comments in the diary of the theatre-lover [[Samuel Pepys]].&lt;ref&gt;Hume (1976, 206–209).&lt;/ref&gt; The expense of mounting ever more elaborate scenic productions drove the two competing theatre companies into a dangerous spiral of huge expenditure and correspondingly huge losses or profits. A fiasco such as [[John Dryden]]'s ''[[Albion and Albanius]]'' would leave a company in serious debt, while blockbusters like [[Thomas Shadwell]]'s ''[[Psyche (Locke)|Psyche]]'' or Dryden's ''[[King Arthur (opera)|King Arthur]]'' would put it comfortably in the black for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous (1979, 47–48).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further information|Neoclassicism}}
[[File:Ostankino19.JPG|thumb|An 18th-century Neoclassical theatre in [[Ostankino Palace|Ostankino]], [[Moscow]]]]
[[Neoclassicism]] was the dominant form of theatre in the 18th century. It demanded [[decorum]] and rigorous adherence to the [[classical unities]]. Neoclassical theatre as well as the time period is characterized by its grandiosity. The costumes and scenery were intricate and elaborate. The acting is characterized by large gestures and melodrama. Neoclassical theatre encompasses the Restoration, Augustan, and Johnstinian Ages. In one sense, the neo-classical age directly follows the time of the Renaissance.

Theatres of the early 18th century – sexual farces of the Restoration were superseded by politically satirical comedies, 1737 Parliament passed the Stage Licensing Act which introduced state censorship of public performances and limited the number of theatres in London to two.&lt;ref&gt;{{See also|Antitheatricality#18th century}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nineteenth-century theatre===
{{Main article|Nineteenth-century theatre}}
Theatre in the 19th century is divided into two parts: early and late. The early period was dominated by [[melodrama]] and [[Romanticism]].

Beginning in [[France]], melodrama became the most popular theatrical form. [[August von Kotzebue]]'s ''Misanthropy and Repentance'' (1789) is often considered the first melodramatic play. The plays of Kotzebue and [[René Charles Guilbert de Pixérécourt]] established melodrama as the dominant dramatic form of the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 277).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Germany]], there was a trend toward historic accuracy in [[Stage clothes|costumes]] and [[Set construction|settings]], a revolution in theatre architecture, and the introduction of the theatrical form of [[German Romanticism]]. Influenced by trends in [[19th-century philosophy]] and the [[visual arts]], German writers were increasingly fascinated with their [[Teutons|Teutonic]] past and had a growing sense of [[Romantic nationalism|nationalism]]. The plays of [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], and other ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' playwrights, inspired a growing faith in feeling and instinct as guides to moral behavior.

[[File:Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton by Henry William Pickersgill.jpg|thumb|170px|right|[[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]].]]
In [[Theatre of the United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and [[Lord Byron]] were the most important dramatists of their time (although Shelley's plays were not performed until later in the century). In the minor theatres, [[burletta]] and [[melodrama]] were the most popular. Kotzebue's plays were translated into English and [[Thomas Holcroft]]'s ''A Tale of Mystery'' was the first of many English melodramas. [[Pierce Egan]], [[Douglas William Jerrold]], [[Edward Fitzball]], and [[John Baldwin Buckstone]] initiated a trend towards more contemporary and rural stories in preference to the usual historical or fantastical melodramas. [[James Sheridan Knowles]] and [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] established a "gentlemanly" drama that began to re-establish the former prestige of the theatre with the [[aristocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 297–298).&lt;/ref&gt;

The later period of the 19th century saw the rise of two conflicting types of drama: [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] and non-realism, such as [[Symbolist theater|Symbolism]] and precursors of [[Expressionism (theatre)|Expressionism]].

Realism began earlier in the 19th century in Russia than elsewhere in Europe and took a more uncompromising form.&lt;ref name=BH370&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 370).&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the plays of [[Ivan Turgenev]] (who used "domestic detail to reveal inner turmoil"), [[Aleksandr Ostrovsky]] (who was Russia's first professional playwright), [[Aleksey Pisemsky]] (whose ''[[A Bitter Fate]]'' (1859) anticipated [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]]), and [[Leo Tolstoy]] (whose ''[[The Power of Darkness]]'' (1886) is "one of the most effective of naturalistic plays"), a tradition of psychological realism in Russia culminated with the establishment of the [[Moscow Art Theatre]] by [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 370, 372) and Benedetti (2005, 100) and (1999, 14–17).&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important theatrical force in later 19th-century Germany was that of [[Georg II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen]] and his [[Meiningen Ensemble]], under the direction of [[Ludwig Chronegk]]. The Ensemble's productions are often considered the most historically accurate of the 19th century, although his primary goal was to serve the interests of the playwright. The Meiningen Ensemble stands at the beginning of the new movement toward unified production (or what [[Richard Wagner]] would call the ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'') and the rise of the [[theatre director|director]] (at the expense of the [[actor]]) as the dominant artist in theatre-making.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 357–359).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zuschauerraum des Bayreuther Festspielhauses (1870s engraving).png|thumb|left|[[Richard Wagner]]'s Bayreuth Festival Theatre.]]

[[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]], a theatrical movement born out of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' (1859) and contemporary political and economic conditions, found its main proponent in [[Émile Zola]]. The realisation of Zola's ideas was hindered by a lack of capable dramatists writing naturalist drama. [[André Antoine]] emerged in the 1880s with his ''[[Théâtre Libre]]'' that was only open to members and therefore was exempt from censorship. He quickly won the approval of Zola and began to stage Naturalistic works and other foreign realistic pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 362–363).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ibsen-by-Bergen.jpg|thumb|[[Henrik Ibsen]], the "father" of realist and modern{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} drama.]]
In Britain, melodramas, light comedies, operas, Shakespeare and classic English drama, [[Victorian burlesque]], [[pantomimes]], translations of French farces and, from the 1860s, French operettas, continued to be popular. So successful were the [[comic opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], such as ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1878) and ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885), that they greatly expanded the audience for musical theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 326–327).&lt;/ref&gt; This, together with much improved street lighting and transportation in London and New York led to a late Victorian and Edwardian theatre building boom in the West End and on Broadway. Later, the work of [[Henry Arthur Jones]] and [[Arthur Wing Pinero]] initiated a new direction on the English stage. While their work paved the way, the development of more significant drama owes itself most to the playwright [[Henrik Ibsen]].

Ibsen was born in [[Norway]] in 1828. He wrote twenty-five plays, the most famous of which are ''[[A Doll's House]]'' (1879), ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' (1881), ''[[The Wild Duck]]'' (1884), and ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' (1890). In addition, his works ''[[Rosmersholm]]'' (1886) and ''[[When We Dead Awaken]]'' (1899) evoke a sense of mysterious forces at work in human destiny, which was to be a major theme of [[Symbolist theatre|symbolism]] and the so-called "[[Theatre of the Absurd]]".{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

After Ibsen, British theatre experienced revitalization with the work of [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[John Galsworthy]], [[William Butler Yeats]], and [[Harley Granville Barker]]. Unlike most of the gloomy and intensely serious work of their contemporaries, Shaw and Wilde wrote primarily in the [[Comedy (drama)|comic form]]. [[Edwardian musical comedies]] were extremely popular, appealing to the tastes of the middle class in the [[Gay Nineties]]&lt;ref&gt;The first "Edwardian musical comedy" is usually considered to be ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' (1892). See, e.g., Charlton, Fraser.

While much [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th-century theatre]] continued and extended the projects of [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] and [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]], there was also a great deal of [[experimental theatre]] that rejected those conventions. These experiments form part of the [[Modernism|modernist]] and [[Postmodern theatre|postmodernist]] [[Art movement|movements]] and included forms of [[political theatre]] as well as more aesthetically orientated work. Examples include: [[Epic theater|Epic theatre]], the [[Theatre of Cruelty]], and the so-called "[[Theatre of the Absurd]]".

The term [[theatre practitioner]] came to be used to describe someone who both creates [[theatre|theatrical]] [[performance]]s and who produces a [[theory|theoretical]] [[discourse]] that informs their practical work.&lt;ref&gt;Milling and Ley (2001, vi, 173) and Pavis (1998, 280). {{lang-de|Theaterpraktiker}}, {{lang-fr|praticien}}, {{lang-es|teatrista}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A theatre practitioner may be a [[Theatre director|director]], a [[dramatist]], an [[actor]], or—characteristically—often a combination of these traditionally separate roles. "Theatre practice" describes the collective work that various theatre practitioners do.&lt;ref&gt;Pavis (1998, 392).&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to describe theatre [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] from [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]'s development of his '[[Stanislavski's 'system'|system]]', through [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]]'s [[Biomechanics (Meyerhold)|biomechanics]], [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s [[Epic theatre|epic]] and [[Jerzy Grotowski]]'s [[poor theatre]], down to the present day, with contemporary theatre practitioners including [[Augusto Boal]] with his [[Theatre of the Oppressed]], [[Dario Fo]]'s [[Popular Theatre|popular theatre]], [[Eugenio Barba]]'s [[theatre anthropology]] and [[Anne Bogart]]'s [[viewpoints]].&lt;ref&gt;McCullough (1996, 15–36) and Milling and Ley (2001, vii, 175).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other key figures of 20th-century theatre include: [[Antonin Artaud]], [[August Strindberg]], [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Frank Wedekind]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Ernst Toller]], [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Jean Genet]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], [[Heiner Müller]], and [[Caryl Churchill]].

A number of [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] movements continued or emerged in the 20th century, including:
*[[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]]
*[[Realism (theatre)|Realism]]
*[[Dadaism]]
*[[Expressionism (theatre)|Expressionism]]
*[[Surrealism]] and the [[Theatre of Cruelty]]
*[[Theatre of the Absurd]]
*[[Postmodern theatre|Postmodernism]]
*[[Agitprop]]

After the great popularity of the British [[Edwardian musical comedies]], the American [[musical theatre]] came to dominate the musical stage, beginning with the [[Princess Theatre, New York City|Princess Theatre]] musicals, followed by the works of the Gershwin brothers, [[Cole Porter]], [[Jerome Kern]], [[Rodgers and Hart]], and later [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]].

==African theatre (including African-American)==

===Ancient Egyptian quasi-theatrical events===
The earliest recorded quasi-theatrical event dates back to 2000 BC with the "[[passion plays]]" of [[Ancient Egypt]]. The story of the god [[Osiris]] was performed annually at festivals throughout the civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatrehistory.com/origins/egypt001.html |title=Egyptian "Passion" Plays |publisher=Theatrehistory.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ghanaian theatre===
Modern theatre in [[Ghana]] emerged in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abarry|first1=Abu|title=The Significance of Names in Ghanaian Drama|journal=Journal of Black Studies|date=Dec 1991|volume=22|doi=10.1177/002193479102200201}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It emerged first as literary comment on the colonization of Africa by Europe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Among the earliest work in which this can be seen is ''The Blinkards'' written by [[Kobina Sekyi]] in 1915. ''The Blinkards'' is a blatant satire about the Africans who embraced the European culture that was brought to them. In it Sekyi demeans three groups of individuals: anyone European, anyone who imitates the Europeans, and the rich African cocoa farmer. This sudden rebellion though was just the beginning spark of Ghanaian literary theater.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A play that has similarity in its satirical view is ''[[Anowa]]''. Written by Ghanaian author [[Ama Ata Aidoo]], it begins with its eponymous heroine Anowa rejecting her many arranged suitors' marriage proposals. She insists on making her own decisions as to whom she is going to marry. The play stresses the need for gender equality, and respect for women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This ideal of independence, as well as equality leads Anowa down a winding path of both happiness and misery. Anowa chooses a man of her own to marry. Anowa supports her husband Kofi both physically and emotionally. Through her support Kofi does prosper in wealth, but becomes poor as a spiritual being. Through his accumulation of wealth Kofi loses himself in it. His once happy marriage with Anowa becomes changed when he begins to hire slaves rather than doing any labor himself. This to Anowa does not make sense because it makes Kofi no better than the European colonists whom she detests for the way that she feels they have used the people of Africa. Their marriage is childless, which is presumed to have been caused by a ritual that Kofi has done trading his manhood for wealth. Anowa's viewing Kofi's slave-gotten wealth and inability to have a child leads to her committing suicide.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The name Anowa means "Superior moral force" while Kofi's means only "Born on Friday". This difference in even the basis of their names seems to implicate the moral superiority of women in a male run society.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Another play of significance is ''The Marriage of Anansewa'', written in 1975 by [[Efua Sutherland]]. The entire play is based upon an Akan oral tradition called ''Anansesem''(folk tales). The main character of the play is [[Ananse]] (the spider). The qualities of Ananse are one of the most prevalent parts of the play. Ananse is cunning, selfish, has great insight into human and animal nature, is ambitious, eloquent, and resourceful. By putting too much of himself into everything that he does Ananse ruins each of his schemes and ends up poor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Ananse is used in the play as a kind of Everyman. He is written in an exaggerated sense in order to force the process of self-examination. Ananse is used as a way to spark a conversation for change in the society of anyone reading. The play tells of Ananse attempting to marry off his daughter Anansewa off to any of a selection of rich chiefs, or another sort of wealthy suitor simultaneously, in order to raise money. Eventually all the suitors come to his house at once, and he has to use all of his cunning to defuse the situation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The storyteller not only narrates but also enacts, reacts to, and comments on the action of the tale. Along with this, Mbuguous is used, Mbuguous is the name given to very specialized sect of Ghanaian theatre technique that allows for audience participation. The Mbuguous of this tale are songs that embellish the tale or comment on it. Spontaneity through this technique as well as improvisation are used enough to meet any standard of modern theatre.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Yoruba theatre===
{{see also|Yoruba literature}}
In his pioneering study of [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] theatre, Joel Adedeji traced its origins to the [[Masquerade ceremony|masquerade]] of the [[Egungun]] (the "cult of the ancestor").&lt;ref&gt;Adedeji (1969, 60).&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional [[rite|ceremony]] culminates in the essence of the masquerade where it is deemed that ancestors return to the world of the living to visit their descendants.&lt;ref&gt;Noret (2008, 26).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its origin in ritual, Yoruba theatre can be "traced to the 'theatrogenic' nature of a number of the deities in the [[Orisha#Pantheon|Yoruba pantheon]], such as [[Obatala]] the arch divinity, [[Ogoun|Ogun]] the divinity of creativeness, as well as Iron and technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilbert|first1=Helen|title=Postcolonial Plays:An Anthology|date=May 31, 2001|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shango|Sango]] the divinity of the storm", whose reverence is imbued "with drama and theatre and the symbolic overall relevance in terms of its relative interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;Banham, Hill, and Woodyard (2005, 88).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Aláàrìnjó]] theatrical tradition sprang from the Egungun masquerade in the 16th century. The Aláàrìnjó was a troupe of traveling performers whose masked forms carried an air of mystique. They created short, [[Satire|satirical]] scenes that drew on a number of established stereotypical characters. Their performances utilised [[mime]], music and [[acrobatics]]. The Aláàrìnjó tradition influenced the popular traveling theatre, which was the most prevalent and highly developed form of theatre in [[Nigeria]] from the 1950s to the 1980s. In the 1990s, the popular traveling theatre moved into television and film and now gives live performances only rarely.&lt;ref&gt;Banham, Hill, and Woodyard (2005, 88–89).&lt;/ref&gt;

"Total theatre" also developed in Nigeria in the 1950s. It utilised non-Naturalistic techniques, [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] physical imagery, and exercised a flexibile use of language. Playwrights writing in the mid-1970s made use of some of these techniques, but articulated them with "a radical appreciation of the problems of society."&lt;ref&gt;Banham, Hill, and Woodyard (2005, 70).&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional performance modes have strongly influenced the major figures in contemporary Nigerian theatre. The work of [[Hubert Ogunde]] (sometimes referred to as the "father of contemporary Yoruban theatre") was informed by the Aláàrìnjó tradition and Egungun masquerades.&lt;ref&gt;Banham, Hill, and Woodyard (2005, 76).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wole Soyinka]], who is "generally recognized as Africa's greatest living playwright", gives the divinity Ogun a complex [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] significance in his work.&lt;ref&gt;Banham, Hill, and Woodyard (2005, 69).&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay "The Fourth Stage" (1973),&lt;ref&gt;Soyinka (1973, 120).&lt;/ref&gt; Soyinka contrasts Yoruba drama with [[Theatre of ancient Greece|classical Athenian drama]], relating both to the 19th-century German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s analysis of the latter in ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' (1872). Ogun, he argues, is "a totality of the [[Apollonian and Dionysian|Dionysian, Apollonian]] and [[Prometheus|Promethean]] virtues."&lt;ref&gt;Soyinka (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

The proponents of the travelling theatre in Nigeria include [[Duro Ladipo]] and [[Moses Olaiya]] (a popular comic act). These practitioners contributed much to the field of African theatre during the period of mixture and experimentation of the indigenous with the Western theatre.

===African-American theatre===
The history of African-American theatre has a dual origin. The first is rooted in local theatre where African Americans performed in cabins and parks. Their performances (folk tales, songs, music, and dance) were rooted in the African culture before being influenced by the American environment. [[African Grove Theatre]] was the first African-American theatre established in 1821 by William Henry Brown {{ISBN|0521465850}}

===Indian theatre===

====Overview of Indian theatre====
{{Main article|Theatre in India}}
The earliest form of [[India]]n theatre was the [[Sanskrit drama|Sanskrit theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 12).&lt;/ref&gt;  It emerged sometime between the 2nd century BC and the 1st century and flourished between the 1st century and the 10th, which was a period of relative peace in the [[history of India]] during which hundreds of plays were written.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1997, 70) and Richmond (1995, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Islamic conquests]] that began in the 10th and 11th centuries, theatre was discouraged or forbidden entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1997, 72) and Richmond (1995, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in an attempt to re-assert indigenous values and ideas, village theatre was encouraged across the subcontinent, developing in a large number of regional languages from the 15th to the 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1997, 72), Richmond (1995, 516), and Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 12).&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Indian theatre developed during the [[British Raj|period of colonial rule]] under the [[British Empire]], from the mid-19th century until the mid-20th.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond (1995, 516) and Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 13).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sanskrit theatre ====
{{Main article|Sanskrit drama}}
{{See also|Koodiyattam}}
The earliest-surviving fragments of [[Sanskrit drama]] date from the 1st century.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii) and Richmond (1995, 516–517).&lt;/ref&gt; The wealth of archaeological evidence from earlier periods offers no indication of the existence of a tradition of theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond 1995, 516"&gt;Richmond (1995, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Vedas]]'' (the earliest Indian literature, from between 1500 and 600 BC) contain no hint of it; although a small number of hymns are composed in a form of [[dialogue]]), the [[ritual]]s of the [[Vedic period]] do not appear to have developed into theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond 1995, 516"/&gt; The ''[[Mahābhāṣya]]'' by [[Patañjali]] contains the earliest reference to what may have been the seeds of Sanskrit drama.&lt;ref name="Richmond 1995, 517"&gt;Richmond (1995, 517).&lt;/ref&gt; This treatise on [[grammar]] from 140 BC provides a feasible date for the beginnings of [[theatre in India]].&lt;ref name="Richmond 1995, 517"/&gt;

However, although there are no surviving fragments of any drama prior to this date, it is possible that early Buddhist literature provides the earliest evidence for the existence of Indian theatre. The [[Pali]] [[Sutta Pitaka|suttas]] (ranging in date from the 5th to 3rd centuries BCE) refer to the existence of troupes of actors (led by a chief actor), who performed dramas on a stage. It is indicated that these dramas incorporated dance, but were listed as a distinct form of performance, alongside dancing, singing, and story recitations.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Van M. Baumer and James R. Brandon (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ix-RShGgZUAC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=actor+drama+pali#v=onepage&amp;q=actor%20drama%20pali&amp;f=false ''Sanskrit Drama in Performance''] (University of Hawaii Press, 1981), pp.11&lt;/ref&gt; (According to later Buddhist texts, King [[Bimbisara]], a contemporary of [[Gautama Buddha]], had a drama performed for another king. This would be as early as the 5th century BCE, but the event is only described in much later texts, from the 3rd-4th centuries CE.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ix-RShGgZUAC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=actor+drama+pali#v=onepage&amp;q=actor%20drama%20pali&amp;f=false ''Sanskrit Drama in Performance''], p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

The major source of evidence for Sanskrit theatre is ''[[Natyashastra|A Treatise on Theatre]]'' (''Nātyaśāstra''), a compendium whose date of composition is uncertain (estimates range from 200 BC to 200 AD) and whose authorship is attributed to [[Bharata Muni]]. The ''Treatise'' is the most complete work of dramaturgy in the ancient world. It addresses [[acting]], [[dance]], [[music]], [[Dramaturgy|dramatic construction]], [[Theatre architecture|architecture]], [[Costume design|costuming]], [[Theatrical makeup|make-up]], [[Theatrical properties|props]], the organisation of companies, the audience, competitions, and offers a [[Hindu mythology|mythological]] account of the origin of theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond 1995, 517"/&gt; In doing so, it provides indications about the nature of actual theatrical practices. Sanskrit theatre was performed on sacred ground by priests who had been trained in the necessary skills (dance, music, and recitation) in a [hereditary process]. Its aim was both to educate and to entertain.

Under the patronage of royal courts, performers belonged to professional companies that were directed by a stage manager (''sutradhara''), who may also have acted.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii) and Richmond (1995, 517).&lt;/ref&gt; This task was thought of as being analogous to that of a [[Puppetry|puppeteer]]—the literal meaning of "''sutradhara''" is "holder of the strings or threads".&lt;ref name="Richmond 1995, 517"/&gt; The performers were trained rigorously in vocal and physical technique.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond (1995, 518).&lt;/ref&gt; There were no prohibitions against female performers; companies were all-male, all-female, and of mixed gender. Certain sentiments were considered inappropriate for men to enact, however, and were thought better suited to women. Some performers played character their own age, while others played those different from their own (whether younger or older). Of all the elements of theatre, the ''Treatise'' gives most attention to acting (''abhinaya''), which consists of two styles: realistic (''lokadharmi'') and conventional (''natyadharmi''), though the major focus is on the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond (1995, 518). The literal meaning of ''abhinaya'' is "to carry forwards".&lt;/ref&gt;

Its drama is regarded as the highest achievement of [[Sanskrit literature]].&lt;ref name="Brandon 1981, xvii"&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii).&lt;/ref&gt; It utilised [[stock character]]s, such as the hero (''nayaka''), heroine (''nayika''), or clown (''vidusaka''). Actors may have specialised in a particular type. [[Kālidāsa]] in the 1st century BC, is arguably considered to be ancient [[India]]'s greatest Sanskrit dramatist. Three famous romantic plays written by Kālidāsa are the ''[[Mālavikāgnimitram]]'' (''Mālavikā and Agnimitra''), ''[[Vikramuurvashiiya]]'' (''Pertaining to Vikrama and Urvashi''), and ''[[The Recognition of Sakuntala|Abhijñānaśākuntala]]'' (''The Recognition of Shakuntala''). The last was inspired by a story in the ''Mahabharata'' and is the most famous. It was the first to be translated into [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]]. ''[[Abhijñānaśākuntalam|Śakuntalā]]'' (in English translation) influenced [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe's]] ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' (1808–1832).&lt;ref name="Brandon 1981, xvii"/&gt;

The next great Indian dramatist was [[Bhavabhuti]] (c. 7th century). He is said to have written the following three plays: ''Malati-Madhava'', ''Mahaviracharita'' and ''Uttar Ramacharita''. Among these three, the last two cover between them the entire epic of ''Ramayana''. The powerful Indian emperor [[Harsha]] (606–648) is credited with having written three plays: the comedy ''[[Ratnavali]]'', ''[[Priyadarsika]]'', and the [[Buddhist]] drama ''[[Nagananda]]''.

[[Kathakali]] is a highly stylised classical [[India]]n [[dance]]-[[drama]] noted for the attractive make-up of characters, elaborate costumes, detailed gestures, and well-defined body movements presented in tune with the anchor playback music and complementary percussion. It originated in the country's present-day state of [[Kerala]] during the 17th century&lt;ref&gt;Zarrilli (1984&lt;!-- PAGE NUMBER OF THIS QUOTATION? --&gt;).&lt;/ref&gt; and has developed over the years with improved looks, refined gestures and added themes besides more ornate singing and precise drumming.

[[Rabindranath Tagore]] was a pioneering modern playwright who wrote plays noted for their exploration and questioning of nationalism, identity, spiritualism and material greed.&lt;ref name="Banham 1995, 1051"&gt;Banham (1995, 1051).&lt;/ref&gt; His plays are written in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and include ''Chitra'' (''Chitrangada'', 1892), ''The King of the Dark Chamber'' (''Raja'', 1910), ''[[The Post Office (play)|The Post Office]]'' (''Dakghar'', 1913), and ''Red Oleander'' (''Raktakarabi'', 1924).&lt;ref name="Banham 1995, 1051"/&gt;

===Chinese theatre===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2011}}
{{Main article|Theatre of China}}

====Shang theatre====
There are references to theatrical entertainments in China as early as 1500 BC during the [[Shang Dynasty]]; they often involved music, clowning and acrobatic displays.

====Han and Tang theatre====
During the Han Dynasty, shadow puppetry first emerged as a recognized form of theatre in China. There were two distinct forms of shadow puppetry, Cantonese southern and Pekingese northern. The two styles were differentiated by the method of making the puppets and the positioning of the rods on the puppets, as opposed to the type of play performed by the puppets. Both styles generally performed plays depicting great adventure and fantasy, rarely was this very stylized form of theatre used for political propaganda. Cantonese shadow puppets were the larger of the two. They were built using thick leather which created more substantial shadows. Symbolic color was also very prevalent; a black face represented honesty, a red one bravery. The rods used to control Cantonese puppets were attached perpendicular to the puppets' heads. Thus, they were not seen by the audience when the shadow was created. Pekingese puppets were more delicate and smaller. They were created out of thin, translucent leather usually taken from the belly of a donkey. They were painted with vibrant paints, thus they cast a very colorful shadow. The thin rods which controlled their movements were attached to a leather collar at the neck of the puppet. The rods ran parallel to the bodies of the puppet then turned at a ninety degree angle to connect to the neck. While these rods were visible when the shadow was cast, they laid outside the shadow of the puppet; thus they did not interfere with the appearance of the figure. The rods attached at the necks to facilitate the use of multiple heads with one body. When the heads were not being used, they were stored in a muslin book or fabric lined box. The heads were always removed at night. This was in keeping with the old superstition that if left intact, the puppets would come to life at night. Some puppeteers went so far as to store the heads in one book and the bodies in another, to further reduce the possibility of reanimating puppets. Shadow puppetry is said to have reached its highest point of artistic development in the 11th century before becoming a tool of the government.

The Tang Dynasty is sometimes known as 'The Age of 1000 Entertainments'. During this era, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang China|Emperor Xuanzong]] formed an acting school known as the Children of the [[Pear Garden]] to produce a form of drama that was primarily musical.

====Song and Yuan theatre====
{{further information|Zaju}}
In the [[Song dynasty]], there were many popular plays involving [[acrobatic]]s and [[music]]. These developed in the [[Yuan dynasty]] into a more sophisticated form with a four- or five-act structure.

Yuan drama spread across China and diversified into numerous regional forms, the best known of which is Beijing Opera, which is still popular today.

===Philippine theatre===
During the 333-year reign of the Spanish government, they introduced into the islands the Catholic religion and the Spanish way of life, which gradually merged with the indigenous culture to form the “lowland folk culture” now shared by the major ethnolinguistic groups. 
Today, the dramatic forms introduced or influenced by Spain continue to live in rural areas all over the archipelago. These forms include the komedya, the playlets, the sinakulo, the sarswela, and the drama. In recent years, some of these forms have been revitalized to make them more responsive to the conditions and needs of a developing nation.

In [[Thailand]], it has been a tradition from the Middle Ages to stage plays based on plots drawn from Indian epics. In particular, the theatrical version of Thailand's national epic ''[[Ramakien]]'', a version of the Indian ''[[Ramayana]]'', remains popular in Thailand even today.

===Khmer and Malay theatre===
In [[Cambodia]], at the ancient capital [[Angkor Wat]], stories from the Indian epics ''Ramayana'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'' have been carved on the walls of temples and palaces. Similar reliefs are found at [[Borobudur]] in [[Indonesia]].

===Japanese theatre===

====Noh====
{{Main article|Noh}}
During the 14th century, there were small companies of actors in Japan who performed short, sometimes vulgar comedies. A director of one of these companies, Kan'ami (1333–1384), had a son, [[Zeami Motokiyo]] (1363–1443) who was considered one of the finest child actors in Japan. When Kan'ami's company performed for [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]] (1358–1408), the Shōgun of Japan, he implored Zeami to have a court education for his arts. After Zeami succeeded his father, he continued to perform and adapt his style into what is today [[Noh]]. A mixture of [[pantomime]] and vocal acrobatics, this style has fascinated the Japanese for hundreds of years.

====Bunraku====
{{Main article|Bunraku}}
Japan, after a long period of civil wars and political disarray, was unified and at peace primarily due to shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543–1616). However, alarmed at increasing Christian growth, he cut off contact from Japan to Europe and China and outlawed Christianity. When peace did come, a flourish of cultural influence and growing merchant class demanded its own entertainment. The first form of theatre to flourish was Ningyō jōruri (commonly referred to as [[Bunraku]]). The founder of and main contributor to Ningyō jōruri, [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]] (1653–1725), turned his form of theatre into a true art form. Ningyō jōruri is a highly stylized form of theatre using puppets, today about 1/3d the size of a human. The men who control the puppets train their entire lives to become master puppeteers, when they can then operate the puppet's head and right arm and choose to show their faces during the performance. The other puppeteers, controlling the less important limbs of the puppet, cover themselves and their faces in a black suit, to imply their invisibility. The dialogue is handled by a single person, who uses varied tones of voice and speaking manners to simulate different characters. Chikamatsu wrote thousands of plays during his career, most of which are still used today. They wore masks instead of elaborate makeup. Masks define their gender, personality, and moods the actor is in.

====Kabuki====
{{Main article|Kabuki}}
Kabuki began shortly after Bunraku, legend has it by an actress named Okuni, who lived around the end of the 16th century. Most of Kabuki's material came from Nõ and Bunraku, and its erratic dance-type movements are also an effect of Bunraku. However, Kabuki is less formal and more distant than Nõ, yet very popular among the Japanese public. Actors are trained in many varied things including dancing, singing, pantomime, and even acrobatics. Kabuki was first performed by young girls, then by young boys, and by the end of the 16th century, Kabuki companies consisted of all men. The men who portrayed women on stage were specifically trained to elicit the essence of a woman in their subtle movements and gestures.

====Butoh====
[[File:Gyohei Zaitsu Butoh.jpg|thumb|Gyohei Zaitsu performing [[Butoh]]]]
{{Main article|Butoh}}
[[Butoh]] is the collective name for a diverse range of activities, techniques and motivations for [[dance]], performance, or movement inspired by the {{nihongo|'''Ankoku-Butoh'''|[[wikt:暗黒|暗黒]]舞踏|ankoku butō|extra1=roughly, "dark steps"}} movement. It typically involves playful and grotesque imagery, taboo topics, extreme or absurd environments, and is traditionally performed in white body makeup with slow hyper-controlled motion, with or without an audience.  There is no set style, and it may be purely conceptual with no movement at all. Its origins have been attributed to Japanese dance legends [[Tatsumi Hijikata]] and [[Kazuo Ohno]]. Butoh appeared first in Japan following [[World War II]] and specifically after [[student riot]]s. The roles of [[authority]] were now subject to challenge and subversion. It also appeared as a reaction against the contemporary dance scene in Japan, which Hijikata felt was based on the one hand on imitating the West and on the other on imitating the [[Noh]]. He critiqued the current state of dance as overly superficial.

=== Persian theatre ===
{{Main article|Persian theatre}}
====Medieval Islamic theatre====
The most popular forms of theatre in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] were [[Puppetry|puppet theatre]] (which included [[Puppet|hand puppets]], [[shadow play]]s and [[marionette]] productions) and live [[passion play]]s known as ''[[Ta'zieh|ta'ziya]]'', in which actors re-enact episodes from [[Muslim history]]. In particular, [[Shia Islam]]ic plays revolved around the ''[[shahid|shaheed]]'' (martyrdom) of [[Ali]]'s sons [[Hasan ibn Ali]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali]]. Secular plays known as ''akhraja'' were recorded in medieval ''[[Adab (behavior)|adab]]'' literature, though they were less common than puppetry and ''ta'ziya'' theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Moreh (1986, 565–601).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Inspector Gadget''''' is a [[media franchise]] that began in 1983 with the [[DIC Entertainment]] animated television series ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]''. Since the original series, there have been many spin-offs based on the show, including additional animated series, video games and films.

The franchise follows the adventures of a powerful but dimwitted [[cyborg]] police inspector named Gadget as he investigates the criminal schemes of [[Dr. Claw]] and his organization, MAD, as they fruitlessly attempt to stop him. However, neither side is aware that it is Gadget's niece, Penny, and her dog, Brain, who are truly responsible for thwarting MAD.

==Main characters==
===Inspector Gadget===
The main protagonist and titular character of the franchise. Gadget is a cyborg (part man, part machine) with thousands of high-tech gadgets installed in his body. Gadget is very powerful and loyal to his career as a lawman, but he is also very dim-witted, clueless, incompetent, oblivious, and gullible, but also lovable, caring, and protective. His attire and personality resembles that of [[Inspector Clouseau]] from ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|The Pink Panther]]'' movies. While Penny and Brain secretly do all the real detective work, Gadget has a knack of inadvertently saving the day, usually without realizing he is doing so. Gadget loves his family more than anything and would do anything to keep them from harm, especially Penny. He was voiced by [[Don Adams]] in the original series and ''Inspector Gadget's Field Trip'' until Adams' retirement from voicing Gadget in 1999, [[Gary Owens]] and later [[Jesse White (actor)|Jesse White]] in the original series' pilot episode, and [[Maurice LaMarche]] in the ''Super Mario Bros. Super Show'', ''Gadget and the Gadgetinis'', the direct-to-video animated films, and various [[DIC Kids Network]] bumpers. For the 2015 series, the voice of Gadget is provided by [[Ivan Sherry]]. In Disney's live-action films, Gadget's real name is John Brown. He is portrayed by [[Matthew Broderick]] in the first film and [[French Stewart]] in the sequel.

===Dr. Claw===
Dr. Claw is the main antagonist of the franchise. He is the leader of an evil crime syndicate called MAD. Only his arms are shown, wearing silver gauntlets with golden spiked wrist bands. A parody of [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] from the James Bond franchise, his face is never seen at all (except in the live action film) with only his hands and pet cat visible. On a Dr. Claw action figure, the face was covered by a sticker on the box, which meant the toy had to be bought for his face to be seen. He is ruthless, murderous, sinister, dark, sadistic, and greedy, and will do anything to rule the world and destroy Gadget. In ''[[Gadget and the Gadgetinis]]'', he reveals that he thinks Gadget's idiocy is an act to taunt him. In the 2015 series, he is noticeably less competent and malicious and the crimes he commits are a lot more petty. He has been voiced by [[Frank Welker]], [[Brian Drummond]], and Martin Roach. In the first live action film, where he is portrayed by [[Rupert Everett]], his name is revealed to be Sanford Scolex. [[Tony Martin (Australian actor)|Tony Martin]] subsequently took over the role of Dr. Claw in the sequel.

===Penny===
Penny is Gadget's intelligent niece and the one who really stops Claw's evil schemes. She uses many high tech devices to help her secretly solve the cases and stop the bad guys such as; a computer book, a video watch, a laptop, and a holographic tablet. However, her meddling often leads to her getting captured by the bad guys, which leaves Brain to rescue her. She is 10 in the original series, 12 in ''Gadget and the Gadgetinis'', 16 in ''Biggest Caper Ever'', and 14 and 15 in the 2015 series. Penny loves her uncle more than anything, which is why she is always ready to help him behind his back, but on a few occasions she gets annoyed by his stupidity. In ''Biggest Caper Ever'', she is notably more selfish and unlike any other incarnation, she doesn't try to help her uncle at all. In the 2015 series, she has become an agent in training and is more physically active than in previous incarnations and she has a crush on Claw's nephew, Talon.
For the original series, her voice was portrayed by [[Mona Marshall]] in the pilot episode, [[Cree Summer]] in the first season, and Holly Berger in the second season. Erica Horn provided her voice in ''[[Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas]]''. From 2001 to 2005, she was voiced by [[Tegan Moss]]. [[Tara Strong]] voices her in the 2015 series. For the live action film, she was portrayed by [[Michelle Trachtenberg]], and [[Caitlin Wachs]] in the sequel.

===Brain===
Brain is Penny's pet dog and adopted brother. He is the only one who knows that Penny is the one who really saves the world. Brain usually has the job of keeping Gadget safe on his missions while Penny investigates M.A.D's crimes. He usually disguises himself when following Gadget, which often causes Gadget to think he's a M.A.D Agent. He is absent in ''[[Gadget and the Gadgetinis]]'' and only shows up in pictures. The reason given for why he is absent is because after all the years of secretly helping Gadget, he has become phobic of gadgets, the Inspector, and the word itself. He ran away to a riverside shack to get away from Gadget. He returned in the episode, ''No Brainer'', where Penny made him a translation collar in order to help find Gadget. However, he does return in later spinoffs.
His voice was played in the original series by [[Frank Welker]], [[Maurice LaMarche]] in ''[[Gadget and the Gadgetinis]]'', and [[Scott McCord]] in the 2015 series. [[Lee Tockar]] voiced him in ''Biggest Caper Ever''. In the live action films, he was first voiced by [[Don Adams]], Inspector Gadget's original voice actor, and then by [[Jeff Bennett]] in the sequel.

===Chief Quimby===
Chief Quimby is Gadget's boss and the chief of police. He usually pops up near the beginning of each episode to give Gadget a sheet of paper describing his mission. Once Gadget finishes reading them, the paper self-destructs and blows up in Quimby's face in a parody of [[Mission: Impossible]]. He appears at the end to congratulate Gadget and give him full credit for stopping Claw. He never knows that Penny did all the work, even though she always calls him. In ''[[Gadget and the Gadgetinis]]'', he has become an agent for the CIA. In the 2015 series, he is given glasses, and his hair is blonde instead of brown.
His voice in the original series was provided by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]] in the pilot, [[Dan Hennessey]] in the first season, and [[Maurice LaMarche]] for the remainder of the series. [[Jim Byrnes (actor)|Jim Byrnes]] voiced him in ''Inspector Gadget's Last Case''. He is voiced by [[Derek McGrath]] in the 2015 series. In the live action films, he was first portrayed by [[Dabney Coleman]], and [[Mark Mitchell (actor)|Mark Mitchell]] in the sequel.

==Series and television specials==

===''Inspector Gadget (1983)''===
{{main|Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)}}
The original [[Cartoon series|animated television series]] in the franchise, ''Inspector Gadget'', debuted in 1983 and introduced audiences to the adventures of a clumsy, simple-witted [[Bionics|bionic]] [[detective]] named Inspector Gadget – a human being with various bionic gadgets built into his body. Gadget's nemesis is [[Doctor Claw]], the leader of an evil organization, known as "M.A.D."&lt;ref name=CookieJar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhxmedia.com/shows/animation/inspectorgadget.html|title=Inspector Gadget|work=[[DHX Media]]|accessdate=2013-06-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502050958/http://www.dhxmedia.com/shows/animation/inspectorgadget.html|archivedate=2013-05-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Inspector Gadget'' was the first cartoon show from DiC Entertainment to be produced directly for syndication. Its two seasons originally ran from 1983 to 1986 and remained in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] into the late 1990s. It continues to air successfully in reruns around the world.

===''Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas''===
{{main|Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas}}
In 1992, DiC produced an animated Christmas special based on the series, ''[[Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas]].'' In the special, Dr. Claw has locked up [[Santa Claus]] at the North Pole and hypnotized his elves, forcing them to break all toys that are being produced. Inspector Gadget, Penny, and Brain travel to the North Pole in an attempt to stop Dr. Claw and save Christmas. This special was nominated for an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]]. [[Don Adams]], [[Frank Welker]], Erica Horn and [[Maurice LaMarche]] provide the voices for the characters.

===''Gadget Boy &amp; Heather''===
{{main|Gadget Boy &amp; Heather}}
The 1995 ''Gadget Boy and Heather'' series was a spin off from the original show. The series is about a [[Younger and junior versions of cartoon characters|younger version]] of Gadget, "Gadget Boy" (also voiced by Don Adams). Instead of Penny and Brain the Dog, Gadget Boy was assisted by the resourceful Heather (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]). Just as maladroit as his adult self is, Gadget Boy was usually bailed out of situations by the more practical Heather, though he was also helped greatly by his myriad high-tech gadgets and extendable arms and legs. In this series, traditional nemesis Dr. Claw was replaced by the villainess Spydra. In addition, the chief, Strombolli had a "fax tie" that exploded after the mission was read, continuing the [[running gag]] from the original series in which Chief Quimby would get blown up by an exploding message.

===''Gadget Boy's Adventures in History''===
Two years later, in 1997, ''Gadget Boy &amp; Heather'' spawned an educational spinoff, ''[[Gadget Boy's Adventures in History]]'', which aired on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]. This series marked the last time Don Adams would perform a voice role for an animated Gadget series two years before his retirement from voicing an animated Gadget in 1999 and eight years before his death in 2005.

===''Inspector Gadget's Field Trip''===
{{main|Inspector Gadget's Field Trip}}

In 1996, Gadget took students around the world in this series of 50 field trips, mainly created to market to stations to fulfill the FCC [[E/I]] requirements. The show put an animated Inspector Gadget on top of live-action filming of the locations that Gadget guided viewers through. Don Adams returned as Gadget's voice while Penny, Brain, Chief Quimby, Capeman and Dr. Claw are entirely absent.

===''Gadget and the Gadgetinis''===
{{main|Gadget and the Gadgetinis}}
In 2002, the French studio SIP Animation (Saban International Paris), in cooperation with DiC, produced 52 episodes of the new TV series ''Gadget and the Gadgetinis.'' The series debuted on the French channel M6 in September 2002 and was aired on Fox Kids channels across Europe from 2003. It has never been broadcast or released in the United States.

Inspector Gadget (again voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is now a member of an organization called "WOMP" (World Organization of Mega Powers) and is now, Lieutenant Gadget. He is still aided in his work by Penny (who is now twelve years old), as well as the new robot characters Digit and Fidget, the titular Gadgetinis invented by Penny, due to Brain running away. It follows the same plot as the original series, with the dim witted Gadget attempting to fight crime on his own, while Penny and her helpers secretly do all the work. Doctor Claw, now with the first name George, returns as the main villain, with his relatives introduced in some episodes. In some stories, he is replaced by other villains.

The production values of this series were higher than any of the previous revivals and spinoff series. Also, the original creators of ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]'' were all involved: [[Andy Heyward]] was one of the executive producers; [[Jean Chalopin]] wrote or co-wrote all the episodes, in addition to being credited as the new show's creator; whereas [[Bruno Bianchi (cartoonist)|Bruno Bianchi]] directed and produced the series.

===''Inspector Gadget (2015)''===
{{Main|Inspector Gadget (2015 TV series)}}
A new CGI-animated ''[[Inspector Gadget (2015 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]'' TV series has been in development since at least the start of 2012, possibly earlier. It was commissioned by [[Teletoon|Teletoon Canada]], which will air the show, and put into preproduction by [[The Cookie Jar Company]]. In January 2012, the in-development show was mentioned by Ray Sharma, the CEO of [[XMG Studio]], which produced the hit mobile game "Inspector Gadget: M.A.D. Dash". Sharma described how the success of the game had resulted in a new TV series being in the making: "We did 1 million downloads in a week, and it's reinvigorated the TV brand with a new TV series in production."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketgamer.biz/r/PG.Biz/XMG+Studio+news/news.asp?c=37301&amp;srch |title=MGF 2012: XMG's Sharma on the potential for transmedia and kickstarting augmented reality gaming with Ghostbusters &amp;#124; news &amp;#124; XMG Studio news |publisher=PocketGamer.biz |date=2012-01-26 |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Cookie Jar issued a short press release about the upcoming series, as part of the advertising for it during the MIPCOM market that October, stating: "Cookie Jar Entertainment is celebrating Inspector Gadget’s 30th anniversary with the launch of a brand-new series with its Canadian broadcast partner TELETOON. The series will again revolve around the iconic bionic bumbling detective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nexttime-gadget.blogspot.no/2012/11/the-new-inspector-gadget-tv-series-is.html |title=Next Time, Gadget!...

Criminals, beware! Bystanders … take cover! Inspector Gadget is back to battle Dr. Claw with all-new gadgets – and all-new gadget-related chaos. But the loveable, bumbling, accidentally-destructive Inspector is not alone in the fight to take down MAD. His ever trusty police-dog, Brain, is still by his side and he's getting extra crime-fighting help from his new partner, Inspector-in-training Penny (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]). With MAD more powerful than ever and with the arrival of Dr. Claw's evil-genius (and totally crush-worthy) nephew, Penny and Brain will need to use every ounce of their training to keep the world safe from Dr. Claw … and Gadget."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teletoonmedia.com/en/index.php/teletoon/press_release/category/teletoon_banff_release |title=The Press Room « Teletoon « Press Release « Inspector Gadget Reboot Tops Off TELETOON Canada’s Latest Original Production Slate |publisher=Teletoonmedia.com |date=2013-06-09 |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the other shows, Penny is more of the protagonist and Dr. Claw is as incompetent and useless as Gadget (if not more so). The series is being produced by [[DHX Media]], which purchased Cookie Jar in 2012. According to a DHX Media distribution catalogue released as a PDF on January 15, 2014, the show premiered in 2015 on Netflix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhxmedia.com/docs/distribution/DHX_MEDIA_CATALOGUE_low_res.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305040458/http://www.dhxmedia.com/docs/distribution/DHX_MEDIA_CATALOGUE_low_res.pdf|archivedate=2014-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhxmedia.com/docs/distribution/|title=DHX Distribution|publisher=DHX Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 4, 2014, it was announced that the series has 26 episodes and that it would air on [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]]'s international channels in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvwise.co.uk/2014/12/boomerang-acquires-inspector-gadget-emea-latin-america-asia-pacific/|title=Boomerang Acquires ‘Inspector Gadget’ For EMEA, Latin America &amp; Asia Pacific|last=Munn|first=Patrick|work=TV Wise|date=December 4, 2014|accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series premiered on [[Boomerang (Australia and New Zealand)|Boomerang]] in Australia on January 5, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.foxtel.com.au/t5/Foxtel-Blog/NEW-THIS-WEEK-Grimm-Pretty-Little-Liars-The-100-America-s-Next/ba-p/40390|title=NEW THIS WEEK: Grimm, Pretty Little Liars, The 100, America’s Next Top Model, People’s Choice Awards, Hello Ladies: The Movie, 2015 AFC Asian Cup and live sport|last=Higgins|first=D|date=January 5, 2015|work=Foxtel|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live action===
{{main|Inspector Gadget (film)|Inspector Gadget 2}}
''Inspector Gadget'' was [[Film adaptation|adapted]] into [[Inspector Gadget (film)|a 1999 live-action film]] by [[Walt Disney Pictures]], starring [[Matthew Broderick]] as the title character and [[Rupert Everett]] as Doctor Claw. As opposed to the animated series, where Gadget is bumbling and clueless and Claw's face is never shown, Gadget appears to be more reliable and competent in detective work and Claw's face appears many times in the film.

A second film, ''[[Inspector Gadget 2]]'' featured many changes from the first one, such as Doctor Bradford no longer assisting Gadget or being his romantic interest, instead being replaced by a well-meaning and upbeat scientist named Baxter. Being a year later in the movie's timeline, Gadget had begun displaying his cartoon namesake's glitches by receiving the wrong gadget when he calls out a specific device. He falls in love with his intended replacement: the fully robotic G2. Furthermore, none of the cast from the first film returned to their roles except [[D.L. Hughley]].

Disney and [[Dan Lin|Lin Pictures]] are making a third movie with [[Dan Lin]] producing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/inspector-gadget-live-action-reboot-in-the-works-115052500963_1.html|title='Inspector Gadget' live-action reboot in the works|first=|last=|date=25 May 2015|publisher=|via=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inspector Gadget: Gadget's Greatest Gadgets===

Released on VHS in 1999 to coincide with [[Inspector Gadget (film)|Disney's live-action theatrical film]], ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget: Gadget's Greatest Gadgets]]'' takes the format of a [[clip show]] in which Gadget has a flashback to his past adventures in the original TV series, using footage from the episodes "The Capeman Cometh", "Prince of the Gypsies", and "Gadget's Gadgets"; as well as some stock footage from ''Inspector Gadget's Field Trip'' for the present-day segments. Maurice LaMarche did Inspector Gadget's voice in the modern segments, marking his first cartoon voice appearance as Gadget, who had previously been voiced by [[Don Adams]]. Original series actors [[Cree Summer]] and [[Frank Welker]] voiced Penny and Dr Claw in the modern segments.

===Inspector Gadget's Last Case===
In 2002, DiC released a full-length animated feature film called ''Inspector Gadget's Last Case'', directed by Michael Maliani. It premiered on television on ''[[Nickelodeon Sunday Movie Toons]]'' and was released on DVD and VHS shortly afterward by [[MGM Home Entertainment]]. The film is about Lt. Gadget giving up his beloved but aging Gadgetmobile, while his archenemy Dr. Claw uses a competing crime fighter to discredit Gadget and cost him his badge. Penny and Brain make appearances as minor supporting characters. In this, Gadget is more competent, yet he is still bumbling, similar to his persona in the pilot episode and his Mathew Broderick counterpart. This film uses the same character designs as the concurrent ''Gadget &amp; The Gadgetinis'' TV series, which debuted on the French channel M6 and the UK's Channel 5 in the fall of 2002. Maurice LaMarche reprised the role of Gadget in this film and [[Jaleel White]] voiced Gadgetmobile. In Germany, the film aired on [[Cartoon Network (Germany)|Cartoon Network]].

===Inspector Gadget's Biggest Caper Ever===
2005's ''Inspector Gadget's Biggest Caper Ever'' was the first ''Inspector Gadget'' animated production to be completely rendered using [[computer animation|3D computer animation]]. It returned Gadget to his familiar trenchcoat from the original series. Brain is also back in his old role, while Penny is now 16 years old. Gadget is again voiced by Maurice LaMarche and Penny and Claw are once again voiced by Tegan Moss and Brian Drummond, while [[Bernie Mac]] voices the Gadgetmobile. The plot features Dr. Claw breaking out of jail with the help of a specially hired Scottish agent named Bombaboy. He and Bombaboy seek out a pterodactyl to get revenge on his captors and launch yet another scheme to conquer the world. It was originally intended to be the first in a series of several animated ''Inspector Gadget'' movies, but apparently due to weak sales, no subsequent films were released.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Video games==
The first game developed based on the series was ''[[Inspector Gadget and the Circus of Fear]]'' developed by [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Beam Software]] and scheduled for release by [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Melbourne House]] in the UK in 1987 for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]]. It resembled the arcade title [[Metro-Cross]] and was a left-to-right scrolling racing/jumping game with a quasi-isometric forced 3d perspective. Although the game was completed, and preview copies were reviewed (unfavourably) in the computing press, it was scrapped on the verge of release. The game featured a cameo by the titular character from the [[Horace series]] of games. An [[adventure game]] based on the series, ''[[Inspector Gadget: Mission 1 – Global Terror!|Inspector Gadget: Mission 1 - Global Terror!]]'' was eventually released on the PC in 1990 by a company called Azeroth.

An LCD Electronic ''Inspector Gadget'' developed by Bandai was released in 1984.

An [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game was planned for release by [[Hudson Soft]], but was quietly cancelled. Instead, Hudson released an [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] game in 1993 simply called ''[[Inspector Gadget (video game)|Inspector Gadget]]''. The game features a rare glimpse of Dr. Claw's face.

Years later, [[Ubisoft]] released ''[[Inspector Gadget: Gadget's Crazy Maze]]'' for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and ''[[Inspector Gadget: Operation Madkactus]]'', for the [[Game Boy Color]]. DreamCatcher Interactive and Magic Pockets released another game, ''[[Inspector Gadget: Advance Mission]]'' for [[Game Boy Advance]].

Light and Shadow Productions also released ''[[Inspector Gadget: Mad Robots Invasion]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] and ''Inspector Gadget Racers'', a racing game for the Game Boy Advance.

''[[Gadget and the Gadgetinis (video game)|Gadget and the Gadgetinis]]'' was the first game based on one of the animated spin-offs and was released for the PlayStation 2 and [[Personal computer|PC]] in Europe.

''Inspector Gadget's MAD Dash'' was released for iOS devices, [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]], by [[XMG Studio]] in 2010. It features Shuki Levy's original theme music and also includes original voices from the show.  In the same game, Doctor Claw reveals his face and is once again given the first name George.

==Music==
Several early rap records sampling the ''Inspector Gadget'' theme song were released in 1985. The Kartoon Krew also released "Inspector Gadget" on [[ZYX Music]], which contains vocal samples and quotes from the popular cartoon series reenacted by the Rap Group for the song. Brownsville rap group Bad Boys &amp; K-Love released a record on Starlite Records called "Bad Boys" that was featured on the UK hip hop compilation ''[[Street Sounds Electro 9]]''. Following the trend, [[Slick Rick]] and [[Doug E. Fresh]] used samples from the ''Inspector Gadget'' theme song on their single "[[The Show (Doug E. Fresh song)|The Show]]". The theme song has been heavily sampled in the years since then.

==Books==
A new ''Inspector Gadget'' comic book, based on the original 1983 TV series, was launched in the U.S. by [[Viper Comics]] in 2011. A preview issue was published as part of the [[Free Comic Book Day]] on May 7, 2011; the entire story was then released officially in August as a 48-page comic book titled "Inspector Gadget: Gadget on the Orient Express". The comic book was written by Dale Mettam and illustrated by José Cobá. No follow-up issues have been released to date.

==Other appearances==
On a 1989 episode of ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'', another DiC production, a live action bumper segment titled ''"Defective Gadgetry"'' had a guest appearance by [[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]], in which he came to the Mario Bros. for help in repairing him. This was his first live-action appearance predating the 1999 live-action film ten years later. Maurice LaMarche (who would assume the voice role in ''"Inspector Gadget: Gadget's Greatest Gadgets"'' ten years later) plays Gadget in this segment. A second live-action segment, ''"Treasure of the Sierra Brooklyn"'' had Gadget returning to help the Mario Bros. find a lost treasure.

The ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode "[[Adoption's an Option]]" featured a sketch featuring the ''Inspector Gadget'' characters in a parody of ''[[The Terminator]]''. In this sketch, Gadget replaces a faulty part with a Cyberdyne part, only to be turned into an unstoppable killing machine when [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]] goes online. The sketch goes on to revolve around Penny and Brain trying to avoid being killed by the now-evil Gadget, eventually killing him in a factory. Meanwhile, Mad Cat dies of [[leukemia]]; at the end of the show, Dr. Claw blames Gadget for Mad Cat's death.  Ironically, Dr. Claw claims that he somehow found out it was Penny and Brain who were behind all of Gadget's successful missions, and planned to gain control of Inspector Gadget via Skynet, and use him to kill them using the Cyberdyne technology that gained control of him. (Penny is voiced by [[Cree Summer]] and Brain &amp; Dr. Claw by [[Frank Welker]], who were the original voice actors for the characters).

{{Nihongo|'''''Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl'''''|かしまし ～ガール・ミーツ・ガール～|Kashimashi ~Gāru Mītsu Gāru~}} is a Japanese ''[[Yuri (genre)|yuri]]'' [[manga]] series written by [[Satoru Akahori]] and illustrated by [[Yukimaru Katsura]]. The manga was originally serialized in ''[[Dengeki Daioh]]'' between the July 2004 and May 2007 issues, and later published in five [[Tankōbon|bound volumes]] by [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]] from January 2005 to May 2007. The story focuses on Hazumu Osaragi, a normal, albeit [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] high school boy who is killed when an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Unidentified flying object|spaceship]] crash lands on him, only to be restored to health as a girl. This results in a [[Lesbian|same-sex]] [[love triangle]] that Hazumu finds herself in with two of her best female friends.

A single [[light novel]] written by [[Mako Komao]] and illustrated by the manga's artist was published by MediaWorks under their [[Dengeki Bunko]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] in January 2006. The manga series was adapted into a twelve-episode [[anime]] television series plus a single [[original video animation]] (OVA) sequel by [[Studio Hibari]]. The anime aired in Japan on [[TV Tokyo]] between January and March 2006; the OVA was released in October 2006. A [[visual novel]] was created based on the series for the [[PlayStation 2]] and was released in March 2006. [[Seven Seas Entertainment]] licensed the manga series for English-language publication in North America and released the five volumes between December 2006 and March 2008. [[Media Blasters]] licensed the anime series, including the OVA, and released three DVD volumes between June and October 2007 with English-subtitles. Media Blasters re-released the anime with an English [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]].

The manga has been given positive reviews by the popular anime and manga magazine ''[[Newtype USA]]'', and at the online resources [[Anime News Network]] and [[IGN]]. The first manga volume was ''Newtype USA's Book of the Month'' for December 2006, and ''Newtype'''s noted Seven Seas Entertainment's "fan-focused" translation without an effort to localize the humor for the mainstream American market. In July 2007, ''Kashimashi'' was Seven Seas Entertainment's best-selling title. The anime has been likened to [[Rumiko Takahashi]]'s ''[[Ranma ½]]'', though only as far as the mutual [[transgender]] themes. Critics of the anime praised the down to earth characters, and the generally great animation quality with its soft and detailed art style.

==Plot==
{{see also|List of Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl characters}}
At the start of ''Kashimashi'', a young high school boy named [[List of Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl characters#Hazumu Osaragi|Hazumu Osaragi]] declares his love to classmate and close friend [[List of Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl characters#Yasuna Kamiizumi|Yasuna Kamiizumi]], but she quickly rejects him. Dejected, Hazumu climbs Mt. Kashima and is killed when an [[Unidentified flying object|alien spacecraft]] accidentally crash lands on him. To rectify this, the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] in the ship named [[List of Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl characters#Hitoshi Sora|Hitoshi Sora]] brings Hazumu back to life, but inadvertently regenerates him as a female right down to the [[DNA]] level. This change in Hazumu serves as the catalyst for the development of character interactions for the remainder of the series.

After Hazumu returns to school, Yasuna unexpectedly professes her love for Hazumu, but this serves only to confuse Hazumu as she adjusts to her new life as a girl. Yasuna, a rather feminine girl, has a unique affliction which makes her incapable of seeing males, and instead sees males as covered in a gray, hazy blur. Hazumu's childhood friend [[List of Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl characters#Tomari Kurusu|Tomari Kurusu]], an athletic girl and [[tomboy]], finds Hazumu's change difficult to cope with. Tomari starts to realize her own romantic feelings for Hazumu as Yasuna starts becoming closer to Hazumu, especially after Tomari witnesses Hazumu and Yasuna kissing one day after school. A conflict arises between Yasuna and Tomari who fight for Hazumu's affection while she is unable to choose between them. This results in a [[love triangle]] emerging between the three female main characters. Hazumu's best male friend [[List of Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl characters#Asuta Soro|Asuta Soro]] also starts having romantic feelings for Hazumu, but tries his best to repress them. Tomari's good friend [[List of Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl characters#Ayuki Mari|Ayuki Mari]], an intelligent girl interested in the sciences, continuously observes the ongoing development of the love triangle while keeping a stance of watching from afar.

The very stoic Hitoshi originally came to Earth in order to study human emotions, especially those related to love, in an attempt to save his species from extinction. His species has long-since given up their emotions resulting in a loss of their sexual urges and thus a continuously dwindling population. Hitoshi moves into Hazumu's home where he is warmly welcomed by [[List of Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl characters#Hazumu's parents|Hazumu's parents]]. He brings with him an [[Artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] [[gynoid]] named [[List of Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl characters#Jan Pu|Jan Pu]] which serves as the [[Autopilot|automatic pilot]] for his spaceship. Jan Pu's body is modeled after Hazumu's own female body, and possesses an energetic and childish personality.

While initially citing Hazumu's change as an accident, Hitoshi later realizes this was an unexpected result of the regeneration process. By the time Hitoshi becomes aware of his mistake, he tells Hazumu and her friends she has only one month left to live. Hitoshi explains to Hazumu's friends how someone very close to Hazumu has to donate "life grains" to Hazumu to sustain her life. While unaware her friends know about her impending death, Hazumu continues to live her life and comes to fully accept her fate. The day Hazumu is appointed to die, she falls off the school's roof and Tomari jumps off the roof in an attempt to save her. While in mid-air, Hitoshi interferes by transferring the necessary "life grains" to Hazumu, and both survive the fall. When they later wake up in the infirmary, Hazumu confesses her love to Tomari, effectively choosing her over Yasuna.

The [[anime]] ends differently, with no life-threatening situation and Hazumu choosing Yasuna in order to help cure her worsening sight problem as it begins to degrade so she can no longer see girls as well. Afterwards however, Yasuna, who becomes able to see all people again, decides to break up with Hazumu, saying she can stand on her own, and in the follow-up [[original video animation]] episode, Hazumu confesses her love to Tomari on Christmas and the two get married in a ceremony held by Hitoshi.

==Production==
When it was decided that ''Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl'' would begin serialization in [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]' [[List of manga magazines|manga magazine]] ''[[Dengeki Daioh]]'', [[Satoru Akahori]] wondered what kind of a message he could send to the readers, and eventually decided he wanted to write a steady message of "true love". Akahori noted that up to the creation of ''Kashimashi'', the works that he created were far apart from the concept of true love, and much of his previous work involved a lot of ''[[ecchi]]'' content which Akahori was attempting to avoid in ''Kashimashi''. He wondered if the story would be interesting, and if he could surprise normal readers and fans of his previous works, if he wrote a true love story without much ''ecchi'' or [[fan service]].&lt;ref name="fan-book"&gt;{{cite book | script-title=ja:かしまし公式ファンブック | trans-title=Kashimashi Official Fan Book | language=Japanese | publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]] |date=March 2006 | isbn=978-4-8402-3409-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When thinking on how to write about true love, Akahori considered laughingly that in normal relationships between boys and girls, it eventually tends towards having [[Sexual intercourse|sex]]. In order to avoid this, he chose to have a cast of female main characters, but he felt that audiences have experienced this before and that it thus would not be enough. This is when he thought up the idea of changing the main character from a boy to a girl. Akahori knew this would be a problem, since normally changing a person's [[gender]] would cause complications, one of them being that the now-female character would invariably want to return to being male. He knew that there were a few problems that could not be avoided, but he wanted to remove the desire to turn back into a male. For this reason, Akahori devised that the character would not want to turn back into a male if there was the impact of the entire world already having accepted the fact that his gender had changed. To do this, Akahori decided to have the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] who crashed into the character to not only revive the character as a female, but to broadcast this over the entire world, which is what happens at the beginning of ''Kashimashi''. Afterwards, Akahori felt it necessary to expand on the alien's role in the story. At this point in the development process, Akahori felt he could now begin writing the story.&lt;ref name="fan-book"/&gt;

The title ''Kashimashi'' loosely translates as "noisy, boisterous, or clamorous" and is derived from the Japanese phrase, {{Nihongo|"When three women gather, it is noisy"|女三人寄れば姦しい|Onna sannin yoreba kashimashii}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gomanga.com/news/features_kashimashi_01.php | title=Kashimashi: The Ultimate Guide | publisher=[[Seven Seas Entertainment]] | accessdate=April 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main title was originally romanized as ''Kasimasi''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kasimasi.com/ | script-title=ja:かしまし～ガール・ミーツ・ガール～ | trans-title=Kasimashi: Girl Meets Girl | publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]] | accessdate=December 6, 2008 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance with [[Kunrei-shiki romanization]], but this was later changed in the English adaptations to ''Kashimashi''&lt;ref name="English-manga-7seas"/&gt; in accordance with [[Hepburn romanization]].

The ''Kashimashi'' manga is written by [[Satoru Akahori]] and illustrated by [[Yukimaru Katsura]].

===Internet radio shows===
There have been two [[Internet radio]] shows for the ''Kashimashi'' series.

The anime opening theme, "Koisuru Kokoro" by [[Eufonius]], and main ending theme, "Michishirube" by [[Yūmao]], were both released on January 25, 2006 in Japan by [[Lantis (company)|Lantis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lantis.jp/new-release/data.php?id=bd7dda1811f014c728ce6efabe061ef3 | title=恋するココロ - TVアニメ『かしまし ～ガール・ミーツ・ガール～』 - eufonius - Lantis web site | trans-title="Koisuru Kokoro" - TV anime "Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl" - Eufonius - Lantis web site | publisher=[[Lantis (company)|Lantis]] | accessdate=February 5, 2008 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lantis.jp/new-release/data.php?id=e039eb8d87329d08f6dc1f5dc5b61e52 | title=みちしるべ - TVアニメ『かしまし ～ガール・ミーツ・ガール～』 - ゆうまお {{!}} Lantis web site | trans-title="Michishirube" - TV anime "Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl" - Yūmao - Lantis web site | publisher=[[Lantis (company)|Lantis]] | accessdate=February 5, 2008 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anime used four alternate versions of the ending theme sung by four of the [[seiyū|voice actors]].

The opening theme "Koisuru Kokoro" was used as the ending theme for the first episode while the song {{Nihongo|"Kimi no Tame ni Dekiru Koto"|キミのためにできること|lit.

===Visual novel===
A [[visual novel]] [[video game]] based on the series named {{Nihongo|''Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl The First Summer Story''|かしまし ～ガール・ミーツ・ガール～ 初めての夏物語|Kasimasi ~Gāru Mītsu Gāru~ Hajimete no Natsu Monogatari}} was first released on the [[PlayStation 2]] on March 30, 2006 in Japan. The game was developed by Vridge, published by [[Marvelous Entertainment|Marvelous Interactive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vridge.co.jp/game_product.htm | script-title=ja:開発製品 | trans-title=Product Development | publisher=Vridge | accessdate=February 3, 2008 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released in two editions, limited and regular, on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mmv.co.jp/special/game/ps2/kashimashi/ | script-title=ja:かしまし　～ガール・ミーツ・ガール～　「初めての夏物語。」 | trans-title=''Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl The First Summer Story'' | publisher=[[Marvelous Entertainment|Marvelous Interactive]] | accessdate=February 3, 2008 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limited edition came in a specially made box with an original drama CD called "Kashimashi Triangle Letter", and a music CD featuring songs from the game in piano arrange versions. The game was later re-released in a Best Collection edition on November 16, 2006, which sold at less than half the price of the original game.&lt;ref name="Best-ed"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000IBDFVM/ | title=かしまし~ガール・ミーツ・ガール~「初めての夏物語。」 Best Collection | trans-title=''Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl The First Summer Story'' Best Collection | publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]] | accessdate=February 1, 2007 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl The First Summer Story'' received a total review score of 26/40 (out of the four individual review scores of 7, 6, 7, and 6) from the Japanese gaming magazine ''[[Famitsu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Famitsu Scores for the Week of 03/23/2006 | journal=[[Famitsu]] |date=March 2006 | quote=Kashimashi! Girl Meets Girl (PS2, Marvelous): 7 / 6 / 7 / 6 - (26/40)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's story begins on the outset of summer vacation. Hazumu's homeroom teacher Namiko Tsuki suggests Hazumu and her friends take a one-week trip to a small mountain village with a hot spring resort. Hazumu's grandparents reside in this town, and are two new characters introduced to the story. Three other female characters are introduced as possible love interests for Hazumu; two are the same age as her, and the third is the older landlady of the resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mmv.co.jp/special/game/ps2/kashimashi/character/index.html | script-title=ja:かしまし　～ガール・ミーツ・ガール～　「初めての夏物語。」 | trans-title=''Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl The First Summer Story'' | publisher=[[Marvelous Entertainment|Marvelous Interactive]] | accessdate=April 19, 2007 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the game is to pair Hazumu up with one of the five female cast of characters. The gameplay's main system comes from Hazumu's indecisive personality. If the player shows more interest in a particular character, the other characters get annoyed that Hazumu is ignoring them, which is displayed in a tension meter. The more Hazumu ignores a particular character, the higher the tension between that character becomes. This ensures Hazumu stays good friends with the possible love interests. In order to view the ending of a particular character, a certain amount of tension will have to be between the other characters, but this cannot be too great or the ending will not show.&lt;ref name="system"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mmv.co.jp/special/game/ps2/kashimashi/system/index.html | script-title=ja:かしまし　～ガール・ミーツ・ガール～　「初めての夏物語。」 | trans-title=''Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl The First Summer Story'' | publisher=[[Marvelous Entertainment|Marvelous Interactive]] | accessdate=April 19, 2007 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[gameplay]] requires little interaction from the player as most of the duration of the game is spent simply reading the text that appears on the game screen which represents either [[dialogue]] between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.mmv.co.jp/special/game/ps2/kashimashi/outline/index.html | script-title=ja:かしまし　～ガール・ミーツ・ガール～　「初めての夏物語。」 | trans-title=''Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl The First Summer Story'' | publisher=[[Marvelous Entertainment|Marvelous Interactive]] | accessdate=December 18, 2008 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important aspect of the game (as in nearly every visual novel) are the "decision points" which appear every so often which give the player the chance to choose from a limited number of options.&lt;ref name="system"/&gt; The time between these decision points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. The game pauses at such moments and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. Each plot line can be achieved through multiple replays.

==Reception==

===Manga===
In July 2007, the English version of ''Kashimashi'' was [[Seven Seas Entertainment]]'s best-selling title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2007/anime-expo/seven-seas-entertainment |title=Anime Expo 2007 Seven Seas Entertainment |last=Santos |first=Carlo |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=June 29, 2007 |accessdate=July 22, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810145742/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2007/anime-expo/seven-seas-entertainment |archivedate=August 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume of the manga was given positive reviews from such sources as ''[[Newtype USA]]'', a popular anime and manga magazine. The first volume was named as ''Newtype USA'''s Book of the Month for December 2006, and the review noted Seven Seas Entertainment's "fan-focused" translation, which retained the honorifics and much of the Japanese wordplay without efforts to localize the humor for the mainstream American market.&lt;ref name="Newtype USA"&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Smith |first=David F. |url=http://www.newtype-usa.com/reviews/index.php?itemid=345 |title=Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~ Volume 1 |work=Newtype USA |volume=5 |issue=12 |page=138 |date=December 2006 |issn=1541-4817 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224141333/http://www.newtype-usa.com/reviews/index.php?itemid=345 |archivedate=February 24, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The review goes on to state that "for fans of more mainstream romantic productions, it's a neat twist on the traditional love-triangle formula, and a charming alternative to boys meeting girls."&lt;ref name="Newtype USA"/&gt; In a review at [[Anime News Network]] (ANN), Carlo Santos commented that "the fast-moving events of this first volume combine to form a story of many moods: a gender-bending comedy, but with sci-fi touches, and most of all, a romance more touching than one might expect. The time has come to rethink the love triangle."&lt;ref name="ANNreview"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/kashimashi-girl-meets-girl-gn-1 | title=Kashimashi manga volume 1 review | last=Santos | first=Carlo | work=Anime News Network | date=December 7, 2006 | accessdate=April 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review at [[IGN]], A. E. Sparrow stated "there's plenty to enjoy in the first book, however. Hazumu attempting to buy his first bra is pretty humorous, as are the occasional visits from the aliens who put him in this situation in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/766/766168p1.html | title=Kashimashi manga volume 1 review | last=Sparrow | first=A. E. | date=February 20, 2007 | work=[[IGN]]  |accessdate=April 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second volume of the manga was positively reviewed at Anime News Network by Theron Martin, who wrote: "With its second volume the title pushes fully into the realm of romantic comedy, liberally sprinkling its story with humorous asides, pratfalls, and anecdotes while still dealing head-on with the much more serious and involved love triangle springing up around Hazumu. For all its attempts to be funny, though, it is the story's more dramatic side that will keep you coming back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/kashimashi-girl-meets-girl/gn-2 | title=Kashimashi manga volume 2 review | work=Anime News Network | last=Martin | first=Theron | date=April 17, 2007 | accessdate=April 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ANN's review of manga volume three, Theron Martin wrote, "The artistry of Yukimaru Katsura rarely devotes more effort to backgrounds than necessary, but its strength has always lain in the character designs and costuming. The array of the female cast provides a great contrast of looks [but] ... the male characters, though easily distinguishable, stand out less."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/kashimashi-girl-meets-girl/gn-3 | title=''Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~'' GN 3 | work=Anime News Network | last=Martin | first=Theron | date=August 17, 2007 | accessdate=December 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ANN's double review of manga volumes four and five, Martin commented, "these volumes offer a solid conclusion to this lovely little ''yuri'' series. It does handle things rather differently than in the anime version, and those irritated by the anime's ending should find this one more to their liking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/kashimashi-girl-meets-girl/gn-4 | title=''Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~'' GN 4 and 5 | work=Anime News Network | last=Martin | first=Theron | date=May 16, 2008 | accessdate=December 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first manga volume was generally panned by Deb Aoki at [[About.com]] where she felt the characters were "too flat and uninteresting", and the story being "too far-fetched" and "ridiculous" to make a good story. However, Aoki admitted the art is "quite nice, and there are some moments of genuine tenderness and humor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manga.about.com/od/reviews/gr/kashimashi1.htm|title=Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl Volume 1|author=Aoki, Deb|work=[[About.com]]&lt;!-- Published by the New York Times Company? --&gt;|accessdate=June 26, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608021159/http://manga.about.com/od/reviews/gr/kashimashi1.htm|archivedate=June 8, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of the first manga volume by Matthew Alexander at Mania.com, he thought that while "stories with love triangles or gender-switching protagonists have been done before...Hazumu's change into a girl explores romance between people of the same sex in an interesting and comedic way."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Alexander, Matthew |url=http://www.mania.com/kashimashi-girl-meets-girl-vol-01_article_83040.html |title=Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~ Vol. #01 |work=Mania |publisher=[[Demand Media]] |date=January 11, 2007 |accessdate=June 26, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002174245/http://www.mania.com/kashimashi-girl-meets-girl-vol-01_article_83040.html |archivedate=2012-10-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anime===
The anime series has been compared with a similar series that involved gender swapping—[[Rumiko Takahashi]]'s ''[[Ranma ½]]''.&lt;ref name="ANNreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="themanime.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=990 | title=Kashimashi ~Girl meets girl~ review | work=T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews | accessdate=April 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review at T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews, the reviewer wrote, "[the anime is] rather aggravating to watch at times, but seems to have no problem raising smiles whenever it wants to, either. The characters, as they are, bring much of the believability of the show, despite the alien elements. It's very much down to earth and pleasant to look at, if nothing else. The rather soft and detailed art style does help, of course, as does the generally great animation quality."&lt;ref name="themanime.org"/&gt; The conclusion of the anime was positively reviewed by Erica Friedman, who is the president of [[Yuricon]], an [[anime convention]] geared towards fans of ''[[Yuri (genre)|yuri]]'' anime and manga, and ALC Publishing, a publishing house dedicated to ''yuri''. Friedman described the anime's conclusion as "so normal - so much like a thing that might have actually happened in real life...that it kind of just went under the radar. So - after all these years of watching crappy unresolved restart endings we FINALLY get a real ending and it's a ''yuri'' ending where the girl remains a girl and get[s] the girl and...thud. Nothing." The anime was given an overall score of 7/10 by Friedman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Friedman|first=Erica|url=http://okazu.yuricon.com/2006/04/06/yuri-anime-kashimashi-girl-meets-girl/&lt;!-- old-url=http://okazu.blogspot.com/2006/04/yuri-anime-kashimashi-girl-meets-girl.html --&gt;|title=Yuri Anime: Kashimashi Girl Meets Girl|work=Okazu|publisher=[[Yuricon]]|date=April 6, 2006|accessdate=April 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three DVD volumes released by [[Media Blasters]] were reviewed by [[Anime News Network]]. In the review of the first DVD, the reviewer commented, "The series' skillful juggling of different characters' viewpoints puts the audience in a position to sympathize strongly with each one. Director [[Nobuaki Nakanishi]] guides the emotional content with a light, gentle touch—wisely forgoing extensive internal monologues, speeches, and emotional outbursts. Instead, he draws you in with soft, effortlessly evocative visuals and a simple, beautifully understated score, relying on subtly shifting facial expressions and meaning-laden actions to communicate the quietly affecting emotional states of his characters."&lt;ref name="dvd1review"/&gt; For the second DVD volume, Theron Martin commented, "Every element of the production, from the style of the artistry to the palette of colors used to the soundtrack, contributes wonderfully to the look and feel of the original story, and the anime script not only exactly duplicates many scenes from the manga but also does everything in its power to stay true to the spirit of the original writing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/kasimasi/sub.dvd-2 | title=Kasimasi Sub.DVD 2 - Triangles Hurt | last=Martin | first=Theron | date=September 3, 2007 | work=Anime News Network | accessdate=December 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, for the third volume, Carl Kimlinger wrote "...the writers make an ill-advised attempt to remove the "bitter" from "bittersweet" by tacking on some decidedly unconvincing plot developments [in the OVA, although]...it isn't as awful as it could have been. The third volume of ''Kashimashi''...creat[es] a deeply satisfying conclusion with all of the vicarious emotional thrills you could possibly want."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/kasimasi/sub-dvd-3 | title=Kasimasi Sub. DVD 3 - Bittersweet Decisions | last=Kimlinger | first=Carl | work=Anime News Network | date=November 14, 2007 | accessdate=December 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three DVD volumes released by Media Blasters were also reviewed by Mania.com. In the review of the first DVD, the reviewer Chris Beveridge described the anime as "something different from the norm" which "mixes romance and comedy quite well". However, the pacing early on is felt as being "awkward" which "takes time to really find its rhythm".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Beveridge, Chris|url=http://www.mania.com/kashimashi-vol-1_article_79313.html|title=Kashimashi Vol. #1|work=Mania|publisher=Demand Media|date=May 9, 2007|accessdate=June 26, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927211211/http://www.mania.com/kashimashi-vol-1_article_79313.html|archivedate=September 27, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the second DVD volume, Beveridge commented that "the mixing of the relationships continues to be the most interesting part of the show." Beveridge goes on to state "the mild moments of it are tacky and bad," but "when it comes to the core cast of characters, it's all solid material that is very enjoyable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Beveridge, Chris |url=http://www.mania.com/kashimashi-vol-2_article_79442.html |title=Kashimashi Vol. #2 |work=Mania |publisher=Demand Media |date=August 13, 2007 |accessdate=June 26, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927211222/http://www.mania.com/kashimashi-vol-2_article_79442.html |archivedate=September 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, for the third volume, Beveridge wrote that "despite the issues with how the series turns in the bonus OVA episode, ''Kashimashi'' has proven to be quite a lot of fun for the situations it presented." The series is seen to "close out rather well," and "not only is it good fun but it's also an enjoyable romantic show with lots of heart and emotion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Beveridge, Chris |url=http://www.mania.com/kashimashi-vol-3_article_79443.html |title=Kashimashi Vol. #3 |work=Mania |publisher=Demand Media |date=October 25, 2007 |accessdate=June 26, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002174347/http://www.mania.com/kashimashi-vol-3_article_79443.html |archivedate=2012-10-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''List of world expositions''' is an annotated list of every [[World's fair|world exposition]] sanctioned by the [[Bureau International des Expositions]] (BIE), including those recognised retrospectively as they took place (long) before BIE came into existence.

The designation "World Exposition" or "Expo" refers to a class of the largest, general scope exhibitions of 3 to 6 months' duration.

This list does not include BIE recognized International Horticultural Exhibitions. For other major international exhibitions, in addition to those endorsed by the BIE, see the comprehensive [[list of world's fairs]].

'''Metanoia''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|μετάνοια}}, ''metanoia'', ''changing one's mind'') in the context of [[rhetoric]] is a device used to retract a statement just made, and then state it in a better way.&lt;ref name="meta1"&gt;Silva Rhetoricae (2006). [http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Figures/M/metanoeia.htm Metanoeia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117043043/http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Figures/M/metanoeia.htm |date=2007-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, metanoia is similar to correction. Metanoia is used in recalling a statement in two ways—-to weaken the prior declaration or to strengthen it.

Metanoia is later personified as a figure accompanying [[kairos]], sometimes as a hag and sometimes as a young lady. Ausonius' epigrams describe her thus: "I am a goddess to whom even Cicero himself did not give a name. I am the goddess who exacts punishment for what has and has not been done, so that people regret it. Hence my name is Metanoea." &lt;ref&gt; Qtd. in Myers, Kelly A. "Metanoia and the Transformation of Opportunity" RSA 41.1 pp1-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weakening==

The use of metanoia to weaken a statement is effective because the original statement still stands, along with the qualifying statement.&lt;ref name="meta2"&gt;VirtualSalt.com (2006). [http://www.virtualsalt.com/rhetoric.htm#Metanoia A Handbook of Rhetorical Devices]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, when one says, "I will murder you. You shall be punished," the force of the original statement ("I will murder you") remains, while a more realistic alternative has been put forward ("you shall be punished").

==Strengthening==

When it is used to strengthen a statement, metanoia works to ease the reader from a moderate statement to a more radical one, as in this quote from [[Marcus Aurelius]]'s ''[[Meditations]]''

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I still fall short of it through my own fault, and through not observing
the admonitions of the gods, and, I may almost say, their direct instructions (Book One);&lt;ref name="meta3"&gt;The Internet Classics Archive (2006). [http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.mb.txt The Meditations]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here Aurelius utilizes metanoia to move from a mild idea ("not observing the admonitions of the gods") to a more intense one ("not observing... their direct instructions"); the clause "I may almost say" introduces the metanoia.

A '''[[microphone]] gaffe''', sometimes referred to as an '''open microphone''' (in [[aviation]], a '''stuck mic''') or a '''hot mic''', is an apparent error whereby a microphone is switched on in proximity of a subject who is unaware that their remarks are being recorded. The error allows unintended listeners to hear parts of private conversations. Errors usually involve live broadcasting in radio or television, and sometimes material is recorded and played back via media outlets. Such events can cause embarrassment for the person or organization involved, sometimes resulting in serious confrontations and employment termination.

==Noted occurrences==
===Television broadcasts===
*In 1999, during a [[Test cricket|cricket test match]] between [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]], Australian [[Scott Muller (cricketer)|Scott Muller]] misfielded a ball and a voice was heard saying, "Can't [[Bowling (cricket)|bowl]], can't throw."

'''Motion-capture acting''', also called '''performance-capture acting''', sometimes abbreviated as '''MoCap''' or '''Pcap''', is a type of [[acting]] in which an actor wears markers or sensors on a skintight bodysuit&lt;ref&gt; NY Castings, Joe Gatt, [http://www.nycastings.com/dmxreadyv2/blogmanager/v3_blogmanager.asp?post=motioncaptureactors Motion Capture Actors: Body Movement Tells the Story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703113656/http://www.nycastings.com/dmxreadyv2/blogmanager/v3_blogmanager.asp?post=motioncaptureactors |date=2014-07-03 }}, Accessed June 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; or directly on the skin.&lt;ref name=twsWired&gt; Hugh Hart, January 24, 2012, Wired magazine, [https://www.wired.com/2012/01/andy-serkis-oscars/ When will a motion capture actor win an Oscar?], Accessed June 21, 2014, "...the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ historic reluctance to honor motion-capture performances ....."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsCalgaryHerald&gt; January 25, 2012, Calgary Herald, [http://blogs.calgaryherald.com/2012/01/25/no-oscar-nod-for-andy-serkis-master-of-stop-motion-acting/ No Oscar nod for Andy Serkis: master of motion-capture acting], Accessed June 21, 2014, "..Serkis has carved out a niche for himself as master of motion-capture roles..."&lt;/ref&gt; Several cameras from different angles record the actor's movements simultaneously, recording the three-dimensional position of the sensors and not recording the rest of the actor. Sampling is done many times each second, aided by advances in computer technology. The resulting database of 3-D points permits a filmmaker or video game creator to create a digital character and to place this character in an entirely new setting, such as on top of a fictional volcano or flying through the air. This type of acting is seen as a growth area, with predictions that there will be more work in future for actors.&lt;ref name="twsBackstage"&gt;Andrew Harris Salomon, Feb. 22, 2013, Backstage Magazine, [http://www.backstage.com/news/spotlight/growth-performance-capture-helping-gaming-actors-weather-slump/ Growth In Performance Capture Helping Gaming Actors Weather Slump], Accessed June 21, 2014, "..motion-capture technology ... indicate that this niche continues to be a growth area for actors...."&lt;/ref&gt; Some theatrical agents represent motion-capture actors.&lt;ref name="twsBackstage" /&gt;

Motion-capture acting can be difficult work. For example, one actor was "placed in a tiny booth, had dots placed all over his face that captured his movements, and had to sit perfectly still".&lt;ref name=twsBackstage/&gt; One report suggested that actors wishing to break into this line of work should go to acting class and become experts in skills such as gunplay, sword fighting, dance, general body movement, running and jumping, gymnastics, and hand-to-hand fighting.&lt;ref name=twsBackstage/&gt; It is a new type of acting work. Numerous sources identify actor [[Andy Serkis]] as the "king of motion-capture acting" based on his work in creating digital characters in movies such as ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' and ''[[Planet of the Apes]]''.&lt;ref name=twsToday&gt; Gael Fashingbauer Cooper, TODAY, May 26, 2014, [http://www.today.com/entertainment/7-summer-movies-you-shouldnt-miss-2D79591396 7 summer movies you shouldn't miss], Accessed June 21, 2014, "....Andy Serkis, the king of motion-capture acting..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsLATimes&gt;Gina McIntyre, June 04, 2014, Los Angeles Times, [http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/star-wars-josh-trank-set-to-direct-standalone-film/#/0 ‘Star Wars’: Josh Trank set to direct standalone film], Accessed June 21, 2014, "..Irish actor Domhnall Gleeson, performance capture expert Andy Serkis ..."&lt;/ref&gt; According to one report, the first use of performance capture acting for a video game was for the 2007 game ''[[Heavenly Sword]]'' which starred Serkis and others.&lt;ref name="CBC News"&gt; [http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/performance-capture-injects-emotion-into-virtual-worlds-1.1104828 Performance capture injects emotion into virtual worlds: Using actors' movements, expressions to animate digital characters in games, film allows audiences to relate], March 7, 2011, Blaine Kyllo, "...Heavenly Sword (2007), which starred Serkis and Anna Torv (Fringe ), was the first video game in which performance capture was used..."&lt;/ref&gt; Serkis said:

{{Quote|Performance-capture technology is really the only way that we could bring these characters to life.

There have been battles within the film industry about earning recognition for motion-capture actors. The Alliance of Motion Picture &amp; Television Producers does not consider motion-capture acting as the same type of work as acting, which means that motion-capture actors are often paid less.&lt;ref name=twsVariety/&gt; The [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG) has lobbied the industry for better employment terms and conditions for motion-capture actors, and argued that motion-capture work should be included in standard labor contracts.&lt;ref name=twsVariety&gt; Dave McNary, December 17, 2011, Variety magazine, [https://variety.com/2011/digital/news/motion-capture-tests-acting-boundaries-1118047652/ Motion-capture tests acting boundaries], Accessed June 21, 2014, "..The Screen Actors Guild ... are the characters in these films ... performing as genuine actors or something else?..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Dave McNary, December 17, 2011, Variety magazine, [https://variety.com/2011/digital/news/motion-capture-tests-acting-boundaries-1118047652/ Motion-capture tests acting boundaries], Accessed June 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The industry in 2012 did not give awards for motion-capture acting.&lt;ref name=twsHollywood&gt; KELSEA STAHLER, DEC 07, 2012, Hollywood.com, [http://www.hollywood.com/news/movies/45718147/andy-serkis-at-the-hobbit-premiere-gollum-motion-capture-acting-is-just-acting?page=all Andy Serkis at ‘The Hobbit’ Premiere: Gollum Motion Capture Acting Is ‘Just Acting’], Accessed June 21, 2014, "..Some film experts have had trouble categorizing the master motion capture actor, The Hobbit star Andy Serkis, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Myself ; Yourself'''''|マイセルフ；ユアセルフ|Maiserufu ; Yuaserufu}}{{ref label|title|a|}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[visual novel]] developed by [[Yeti (Japanese company)|Yeti]] which was released on December 20, 2007 for the [[PlayStation 2]]. ''Myself ; Yourself'' is the second original game published by [[Regista]], the first being ''[[I/O (visual novel)|I/O]]''. [[Takumi Nakazawa]], the main scenario writer for the ''infinity'' series (''[[Ever17]]'', ''[[Remember11]]''), is the principal writer for ''Myself ; Yourself''. Character design for the game is provided by [[Mutsumi Sasaki]], who also produced the original character design for ''[[Memories Off]]'', ''[[Happy Lesson]]'', and ''[[Futakoi]]''. Before the game's release, a [[light novel]] based on the story, written by [[Takumi Nakazawa]], and illustrated by Wadapen, was serialized in the Japanese [[bishōjo]] magazine ''[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]'' between March and November 2007, published by [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]. An [[anime]] adaptation began airing in Japan on October 3, 2007 on the [[TV Kanagawa]] television network, and contained thirteen episodes. A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] sequel to the visual novel was developed by the previous staff entitled ''Myself ; Yourself: Sorezore no Finale'' and was released on May 28, 2009 for the PlayStation 2.

==Plot==
''Myself ; Yourself'' is set in 2007 in the fictional town {{Nihongo|Sakuranomori|桜乃杜}} in W Prefecture which is modeled after [[Wakayama Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. The town is in a quiet, rural area on the southern tip of the prefecture and borders the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Sakuranomori is the birthplace of Sana Hidaka, a sixteen-year-old high school student, who grew up with his childhood friends Nanaka Yatsushiro &amp; Aoi Oribe, his best friend Shusuke Wakatsuki, and Shusuke's fraternal [[twin]] sister Shuri Wakatsuki. Sana left Sakuranomori when he was eleven years old, but returns five years later living on his own in the apartment building Aoi's family runs. Sana soon finds out that while some things have stayed the same, there are still just as many things that have changed.

==Characters==
&lt;!-- Anyone who has played the game, please make distinctions between what was in the game, and what was in the anime. --&gt;

===Protagonists===
;{{Nihongo|Sana Hidaka|日高 佐菜|Hidaka Sana|born October 13, 1991}}
:{{anime voice|[[Shinnosuke Tachibana]]}} (regular), [[Madoka Kimura]] (childhood)
:Sana is the main protagonist of the series. He left Sakuranomori during his childhood, and during the beginning of the series he comes back to live by himself in the apartment building owned by Aoi's parents. He apparently had a crush on Nanaka before he left and still holds those feelings for her. He used to play the piano, but he forgot every song except the song Nanaka wrote for him which he says is very important to him. He has a [[Hemophobia|fear of blood]] because he tried to commit suicide during his middle-school years due to constantly being bullied. At the end of the anime series, Sana proposes to Nanaka and she accepts by wearing the proposal ring during her concert.

:In the game, his default romantic partner is Nanaka Yatsushiro, as shown in "Sorezore no Finale".

;{{Nihongo|Shusuke Wakatsuki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yetigame.jp/myselfyourself/chara/syusuke/syusuke.gif|title=Image of Syusuke's official romanization|accessdate=2007-09-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722131046/http://www.yetigame.jp/myselfyourself/chara/syusuke/syusuke.gif|archive-date=2011-07-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|若月 修輔|Wakatsuki Shūsuke|born March 23, 1991}}
:{{anime voice|[[Takehito Koyasu]]}} (regular), [[Yūko Sanpei]] (childhood)
:Shūsuke is one of the four childhood friends Sana left behind when he moved, and they renew their friendship on his return. He is Sana's best friend and the only male besides Sana in their circle. He is the younger twin of Shuri Wakatsuki. Yuzuki-sensei refers him as the lucky one of the Wakatsuki twins. When he and Shuri are accused of being lovers, their father decides to send Shuri away to London. When Shuri tells Shūsuke that she cannot stand to be separated from him, they decide to run away together knowing people will think that they have eloped.
:In the game, his default romantic partner is Asami Hoshino, as shown in "Sorezore no Finale". However, in the first game, if Sana takes Shuri's route, Shūsuke will admit that he has romantic feelings for his sister. Even though Shūsuke has these feelings, if playing the game as Shūsuke, there is no Shuri route.

===Heroines===
;{{Nihongo|Nanaka Yatsushiro|八代 菜々香|Yatsushiro Nanaka|born July 29, 1991}}
:{{anime voice|[[Ami Koshimizu]]}}
:Nanaka is one of Sana's childhood friends and seemed to have feelings for Sana. When Sana returns to town after five years, her personality has changed from sweet and caring to a cold and moody demeanor. On meeting again she slaps him, apparently for not recognizing her. In the anime, it is also explained that they had agreed to send letters to one another and that Sana had neglected to do so, while Nanaka had stuffed their mailbox with countless letters begging for help. This may have also provided motivation for the slap. She still seems to have romantic feelings for him as she gets jealous whenever Sana is with another girl (especially Asami).

:Nanaka was a victim of a possible arson shortly after Sana left Sakuranomori, and lost both of her parents in the fire. She managed to escape with only her violin (which she stopped playing and kept only as a memento) and the sakura bracelet that Sana had given her. She claims [[Post-traumatic amnesia|not to remember]] anything of the events of that night. Her uncle and aunt took her in and made efforts to ensure that she didn't try to remember to spare her further pain. Events after Sana's return, however, start triggering buried memories and she comes to remember everything. Her father was unable to cope with the knowledge that her mother had been unfaithful to him with their very close friend a short time prior to their marriage. As a result, Nanaka's father immolated himself and his wife after knocking her senseless when she confirmed that Nanaka was in fact the result of the tryst and not his daughter after all, something that Nanaka's uncle had always suspected. (Nanaka's biological father was also her violin teacher.) Unable to cope with the burden of her returned memories, Nanaka attempts suicide but is discovered in time by Sana, who overcomes his fear of blood to save her. In the last episode of the anime, Sana proposes to her and she accepts.

:In the game, her default romantic partner is Sana, as shown in "Sorezore no Finale". It is also revealed that she and Asami Hoshino are cousins, which surprises Hinako at first. She later comments that she knew there was some kind of a connection between them because they both had the same air to them. Nanaka dreams of becoming a professional violinist, which was inspired by Sana's suggestion as a child.
  
;{{Nihongo|Aoi Oribe|織部 麻緒衣|Oribe Aoi|born August 28, 1990}}
:{{anime voice|[[Tomoko Kaneda]]}}
:Despite the fact that Sana calls her mother his aunt, Aoi and Sana are not related (in Japan it is common to refer to a woman older than oneself as oba-san, which is also the term used for an aunt). Her parents own the apartment building that Sana lives in. Her vision has weakened ever since she entered high school, so she now wears glasses. She loves to read books and is very energetic but clumsy. She has a very high-pitched voice and child-like character, but has a busty physique. Despite being childish, Aoi has a very caring personality, and never fails to aid a friend in need. Her dream is to become a picture-book author. This dream was inspired by Sana.

;{{Nihongo|Shuri Wakatsuki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yetigame.jp/myselfyourself/chara/syuri/syuri.gif|title=Image of Syuri's official romanization|accessdate=2007-09-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928132919/http://www.yetigame.jp/myselfyourself/chara/syuri/syuri.gif|archivedate=2007-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|若月 朱里|Wakatsuki Shūri|born March 23, 1991}}
:{{anime voice|[[Yukari Tamura]]}}
:Shuri is one of Sana's childhood friends and the older twin of Shūsuke. Yuzuki-sensei refers her as the unlucky Wakatsuki twin. She is the most athletic of all the girls, although she is somewhat lacking when it comes to her figure. Shuri is a very supportive friend and had no trouble reconnecting with Sana, even after his prolonged absence. She also volunteers at the local retirement home and later invites Asami to join her. In the anime, she and Shūsuke run away together, but come back in the final episode to see Nanaka's violin performance.

[[File:Myself ; Yourself heroines.jpg|thumb|400px|right|The heroines of ''Myself ; Yourself'' (from left to right): Nanaka, Aoi, Shuri, Hinako, Yuzuki, and Asami.]]
;{{Nihongo|Hinako Mochida|持田 雛子|Mochida Hinako|born August 5, 1997}}
:{{anime voice|[[Ayumi Murata]]}}, [[Ayano Niina]] (''Sorezore no Finale'')
:Hinako is a ten-year-old girl going on eleven. She has been infatuated with Shūsuke since he saved her from three bullies who had taken her school bag and would not give it back. She wants to know how to become a girl that he will like and asks Sana and Aoi for their help. Hinako's personality is similar  to Aoi's, however being only in the fifth grade, she is more childish. In the last anime episode, it is shown that she is the girlfriend of Asami's cousin, who is five years younger than she is.

;{{Nihongo|Yuzuki Fujimura|藤村 柚希|Fujimura Yuzuki|born December 26, 1982}}
:{{anime voice|[[Megumi Toyoguchi]]}}
:Yuzuki is the twenty-five-year-old homeroom teacher of Sana's class; Shūsuke, Nanaka, and Shuri are also in the same class. It is a well known secret that she rewards her students with caramel candy whenever they do a good job in school, whether it involves assigned duties or favors for her. This habit of rewarding her students with candy originated many years previously when she was still in high school and found a child attempting to perform a flip over a metal bar in the park (revealed to be Sana in the anime). She offered him a caramel as a reward if he succeeded, which, of course, he did.

;{{Nihongo|Asami Hoshino|星野 あさみ|Hoshino Asami|born October 28, 1991}}
:{{anime voice|[[Mai Nakahara]]}}
:Asami is Sana's childhood friend and a second year student. Although she volunteers at the retirement home along with Shuri and seems to have a very gentle personality, she is in fact quite vindictive and  takes revenge on people who hurt her. In the anime, she had a crush on Shuri and when she confessed to her, Shuri said that they should remain friends. Angered, Asami wrote a letter to the school accusing Shuri and her twin of being lovers. She later invites Shuri and Sana to the hospital to visit a sick woman from the retirement home in an attempt to hurt Shuri mentally. To her surprise, Shuri doesn't react as she expected and seems unfazed. The old woman obtains a knife and tries to kill Shuri in a fit of madness (brought on by the death of her granddaughter) but Asami knocks Shuri out of harm's way and is stabbed in her stead. She comes to realize that her hatred of Shuri is unfounded and tries to make amends.
:In the game, her default romantic partner is Shūsuke Wakatsuki, as shown in "Sorezore no Finale". She is also revealed to be Nanaka's cousin.

(#^.^#)"|はじめてのKiss?(#^.^#)}} by [[Ayumi Murata]], {{Nihongo|"Mirai Kansoku"|未来観測}} by [[Megumi Toyoguchi]], and {{Nihongo|"Haru no Kiss"|春のKISS}} by [[Mai Nakahara]]. Each of the ending themes are sung by the [[Seiyū|voice actresses]] of the six heroines from the series. These songs were released as [[Image song|character song]] albums: volumes one through three were released on November 21, 2007 and consist of the themes "Another World", "Hajimete no Kiss? (#^.^#)", and "Haru no Kiss" respectively. The second batch, volumes four through six, were released on December 7, 2007 and consisted of the themes "Never leave me home", "Aoitori", and "Mirai Kansoku" respectively. The game's original soundtrack was released with the limited edition release of the game on December 20, 2007; the soundtrack was also used for the anime version.

==Reception==
Stig Høgset from THEM Anime Reviews comments that the anime is similar to ''[[Kanon (visual novel)|Kanon]]'' due to both having "a guy who's not a complete loser, who returns to his old town and meets various people, most of them girls or teachers/parents of said girls. Unlike with ''Kanon'', however, these are people he already know{{sic}}." He criticizes the anime for Aoi's "unchanging voice" throughout the flashback, the present and the epilogue that flash forwards ten years into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=1035|title=Myself; Yourself|first=Stig|last=Høgset|publisher=THEM Anime Reviews|accessdate=January 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''oxymoron''' (usual plural '''oxymorons''',  more rarely '''oxymora''') is a [[rhetorical device]] that uses an ostensible [[self-contradiction]] to illustrate a rhetorical point or to reveal a [[paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lewis|first1=Charlton T.|last2=Short|first2=Charles|title=A Latin Dictionary|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=oxymorus|publisher=Clarendon Press|accessdate=27 October 2015|location=Oxford|date=1879|quote=''acutely silly'': oxymora verba, ''expressions which at first sight appear absurd, but which contain a concealed point''; so especially of such apparently contradictory assertions as: cum tacent clamant, etc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jebb|first1=Sir Richard C.|title=Sophocles: The Plays and Fragments, with critical notes, commentary, and translation in English prose. Part III: The Antigone|date=1900|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=567|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0023:text=comm:commline=74&amp;highlight=o%29cu%2Fmwron|chapter=Sophocles, ''Oedipus at Colonus''|quote=The phrase is an '' 'ὀξύμωρον' '' (a paradox with a point).}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A more general meaning of "contradiction in terms" (not necessarily for rhetoric effect) is recorded by the ''[[OED]]'' for 1902.&lt;ref&gt;"A figure of speech in which a pair of opposed or markedly contradictory terms are placed in conjunction for emphasis" ''[[OED]]''&lt;/ref&gt;.

The term is first recorded as latinized Greek ''{{lang|la|oxymōrum}}'', in [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]] (c. AD 400);&lt;ref&gt;Honoratus on ''[[Aeneid]]'' 7.295, ''num capti potuere capi'' (in the voice of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]) "Could captured slaves not be enslaved again?" (William 1910): ''capti potuere capi, cum felle dictum est: nam si hoc removeas, erit oxymorum.'' "the captured can be captured: said with bitterness, for if you were to remove that, it would be ''oxymorum''." see H. Klingenberg in Birkmann et al. (ed.), ''FS Werner'',  de Gruyter (1997), [https://books.google.com/books?id=F5UDDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143 p. 143].&lt;/ref&gt; it is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὀξύς}} ''{{transl|grc|oksús}}'' "sharp, keen, pointed"&lt;ref name=LSJ1&gt;{{LSJ|o)cu/s2|ὀξύς|longref}}. Retrieved 2013-02-26.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|grc|μωρός}} {{transl|grc|''mōros''}} "dull, stupid, foolish";&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|mwro/s|μωρός|shortref}}. Retrieved 2013-02-26.&lt;/ref&gt; as it were, "sharp-dull", "keenly stupid", or "pointedly foolish".&lt;ref name=LSJ2&gt;{{LSJ|o)cu/mwros|ὀξύμωρος|shortref}}. Retrieved 2013-02-26. "Pointedly foolish: a witty saying, the more pointed from being paradoxical or seemingly absurd."&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''oxymoron'' is [[Autological word|autological]], i.e. it is itself an example of an oxymoron. The Greek compound word {{lang|grc|ὀξύμωρον}} ''{{transl|grc|oksýmōron}}'', which would correspond to the Latin formation, does not seem to appear in any known Ancient Greek works prior to the formation of the Latin term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/135679?rskey=7ZL0rI&amp;result=3&amp;isAdvanced=false# |title=oxymoron &amp;#124;accessdate 26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types and examples==
Oxymorons in the narrow sense are a rhetorical device used deliberately by the speaker, and intended to be understood as such by the listener.
In a more extended sense, the term "oxymoron" has also been applied to inadvertent or incidental contradictions, as in the case of "[[dead metaphor]]s" ("barely clothed" or "terribly good"). Lederer (1990), in the spirit of "recreational linguistics", goes as far as to construct "logological oxymorons" such as reading the word ''nook'' as composed of "no" and "ok" or the surname ''Noyes'' as composed of "no" plus "yes", or far-fetched punning such as "divorce court", "U.S. Army Intelligence" or "press release".&lt;ref name=Lederer&gt;[[Richard Lederer]], "Oxymoronology" in  ''[[Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics]]'' (1990), online version: [http://www.fun-with-words.com/oxym_oxymoronology.html fun-with-words.com].&lt;/ref&gt;
There are a number of single-word oxymorons built from "dependent morphemes"&lt;ref name=Lederer/&gt; (i.e. no longer a productive [[English compound|compound]] in English, but loaned as a compound from a different language),  as with ''[[wikt:preposterous|pre-posterous]]'' (lit. "with the hinder part before", compare ''[[husteron proteron]]'', "[[:wikt: upside-down|upside-down]]", "[[:wikt:head over heels|head over heels]]", [[wikt:ass-backwards|ass-backwards]]" etc.)&lt;ref&gt;"closely related to hysteron proteron, it shouldn't be ''ass backward'', which is the proper arrangement of one's anatomy, to describe things all turned around. For that state of disarray the expression should be ''ass frontward''."
[[Richard Lederer]], ''Amazing Words'' (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=tnxQCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT107 p. 107].&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[sophomore|sopho-more]]'' (an artificial Greek compound, lit. "wise-foolish").

The most common form of oxymoron involves an [[adjective]]–[[noun]] combination of two words, but they can also be devised in the [[semantics|meaning]] of sentences or phrases.
One classic example of the use of oxymorons in English literature can be found in this example from [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', where [[Romeo]] strings together thirteen in a row:
{{poemquote|1=O brawling love! O loving hate!
  O anything of nothing first create!
O heavy lightness, serious vanity!
  Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
  Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|first1=William|authorlink1=William Shakespeare|title=[[Romeo and Juliet]]|chapter=Act 1, Scene 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Shakespeare heaps up many more oxymorons in ''Romeo and Juliet'' in particular ("Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical! Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb! Despised substance of divinest show!" etc.) and uses them in other plays, e.g. "I must be cruel only to be kind" (''Hamlet''), "fearful bravery" (''Julius Caesar''), "good mischief" (''The Tempest''), and in his sonnets, e.g. "tender churl", "gentle thief".&lt;!-- taken from hubpages.com/literature/shakespeare-oxymorons  -- cannot be bothered to reference this properly because it is too easy to google--&gt;
Other examples from English-language literature include:
"hateful good" ([[Chaucer]], translating ''odibile bonum'')&lt;ref&gt;"Poverte is hate[fu]l good", glossed  ''Secundus philosophus: paupertas odibile bonum''; the saying is recorded by [[Vincent of Beauvais]] as attributed to [[Secundus the Silent]] (also referenced in [[Piers Plowman]]). 
[[Walter William Skeat]] (ed.), ''Notes on the Canterbury Tales'' (''Complete Works of Geoffrey Chaucer'' vol. 5, 1894), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3efWXPDaIiUC&amp;pg=PA321 p. 321].&lt;/ref&gt;
"proud humility" ([[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]]),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Epithalamion]]'' (1595), of feminine virtue, echoed by Milton as "modest pride". Joshua Scodel, ''Excess and the Mean in Early Modern English Literature'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=5UsxJfvHN3oC&amp;pg=PA267&amp;lpg=PA267 p. 267].&lt;/ref&gt;
"darkness visible" ([[John Milton|Milton]]), 
"beggarly riches" ([[John Donne]]),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions]]'', (1624)&lt;/ref&gt;
"[[wikt:damn with faint praise|damn with faint praise]]" ([[Alexander Pope|Pope]]),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot]]'' (1734)&lt;/ref&gt;
"expressive silence" ([[James Thomson (poet, born 1700)|Thomson]], echoing [[Cicero]]'s {{lang-la|cum tacent clamant|lit=when they are silent, they cry out}}), 
"melancholy merriment" ([[Byron]]),
"faith unfaithful", "falsely true" ([[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]]),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Idylls of the King]]'': "And faith unfaithful kept him falsely true."&lt;/ref&gt;
"conventionally unconventional", "tortuous spontaneity" ([[Henry James]])&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Lesson of the Master]]'' (1888)&lt;/ref&gt; 
"delighted sorrow", "loyal treachery",  "scalding coolness" ([[Hemingway]]).&lt;ref&gt;Geneviève Hily-Mane
, ''Le style de Ernest Hemingway: la plume et le masque'' (1983), [https://books.google.com/books?id=N-1MbsaoWvwC&amp;pg=PA169 p. 169].&lt;/ref&gt;

In literary contexts, the author does not usually signal the use of an oxymoron, but in rhetorical usage, it has become common practice to advertise the use of an oxymoron explicitly to clarify the argument, as in:
:"Voltaire [...] we might call, by an oxymoron which has plenty of truth in it, an 'Epicurean pessimist.'" (''[[Quarterly Review]]'' vol. 170 (1890), p. 289)
In this example, "Epicurean pessimist" would be recognized as an oxymoron in any case, as the core tenet of [[Epicureanism]] is [[Ataraxia|equanimity]] (which would preclude any sort of [[pessimism|pessimist outlook]]). However, the explicit advertisement of the use of oxymorons opened up a sliding scale of less than obvious construction, ending in the "[[#opinion oxymoron|opinion oxymoron]]s" such as "[[business ethics]]".

[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] interpreted his own surname as derived from the [[Low German]] equivalent of ''dull-keen'' (High German ''{{lang|de|[[wikt:tollkühn|toll-kühn]]}}'') which would be a literal equivalent of Greek ''oxy-moron''.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Adam Roberts, ^''The Riddles of The Hobbit'' (2013), p. 164f;  J.R. Holmes in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'' (2007),  [https://books.google.com/books?id=B0loOBA3ejIC&amp;pg=PA53 p. 53]. It has been suggested that the actual etymology of the Tolkien surname is more likely from the village of Tolkynen in [[Kętrzyn|Rastenburg]], [[East Prussia]]. M. Mechow, ''Deutsche Familiennamen preussischer Herkunft'' (1994), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Comical oxymoron"==
{{anchor|comical oxymoron}}{{anchor|opinion oxymoron}}
"Comical oxymoron" is a term for the claim, for comical effect, that a certain phrase or expression is an oxymoron (called "opinion oxymorons" by Lederer (1990)&lt;ref name=Lederer/&gt;).
The humour derives from implying that an assumption (which might otherwise be expected to be controversial or at least non-evident) is so obvious as to be part of the lexicon. 
An example of such a "comical oxymoron" is "[[educational television]]":   the humour derives entirely from the claim that it is an oxymoron by the implication that "television" is so trivial as to be inherently incompatible with "education".&lt;ref&gt;"Hosted for 33 years by the conservative intellectual William F. Buckley Jr., the show [''[[Firing Line (TV series)|Firing Line]]'' taped its final installment [... in 1999.] The show was spawned in the earnest mid-'60s, before popular culture swallowed up the middlebrow and 'educational TV' became a comical oxymoron." ''Time'' Volume 154, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jSHgAAAAMAAJ Issues 18-27] (1999), p.  126.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a 2009 article called "Daredevil", [[Garry Wills]]  accused [[William F. Buckley]] of popularising this trend, based on the success of the latter's claim that "an intelligent liberal is an oxymoron."&lt;ref&gt;According to Wills, Buckley has  "poisoned the general currency" of the word oxymoron by using it as just a "fancier word for 'contradiction'", when he said that "an intelligent liberal is an oxymoron".  Wills argues that use of the term "oxymoron" should remain reserved for the conscious use of contradiction to express something that is "surprisingly true". {{cite web|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Wills-watching-7069 |title=Wills watching by Michael McDonald |publisher=The New Criterion |date= |accessdate=2012-03-27}} {{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/07/daredevil/307546/?single_page=true |title="Daredevil" - Garry Wills|publisher= ''[[The Atlantic]]'' |date=2009-07-01 |accessdate=2012-03-27}}  However, the usage of "oxymoron" for "contradiction" is recorded by the [[OED]] from the year 1902 onward.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples popularized by comedian [[George Carlin]] in 1975 include "military intelligence" (a play on the lexical meanings of the term "intelligence", implying that "military" inherently excludes the presence of "intelligence") and "[[business ethics]]" (similarly implying that the mutual exclusion of the two terms is evident or commonly understood rather than the partisan [[Anti-corporate activism|anti-corporate]] position).&lt;ref&gt;"Saturday Night Live transcripts." Season 1, Episode 1. 11 October 1975. http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75acarlin2.phtml.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly,  the term "civil war" is sometimes jokingly referred to as an "oxymoron" (punning on the lexical meanings of the word "civil").&lt;ref&gt;discussed by L. Coltheart in Moira Gatens, Alison Mackinnon (eds.), ''Gender and Institutions: Welfare, Work and Citizenship'' (1998), p. 131, but already alluded to in 1939 by John Dover Wilson in his edition of William Shakespeare's ''King Richard II'' (p. 193), in reference to the line  ''The King of Heaven forbid our lord the king / Should so with civil and uncivil arms Be rushed upon!'' :"A quibbling oxymoron: 'civil' refers to civil war; 'uncivil' = barbarous".&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include "healthful Mexican food" (1989),&lt;ref&gt;referenced in the negative: "'Healthful' and 'Mexican food' need not be an oxymoron" (''Texas Monthly'', 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; "affordable caviar" (1993),&lt;ref&gt;"This opened up an oxymoron too dreadful to contemplate: affordable caviar" (''The Guardian'', 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Microsoft Works]]" (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Marie Meier, ''A Treasury of Email Humor'', Volume 1
(2000), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Antonym pairs ==
{{see|Antonym}}
Listing of antonyms, such as "[[good and evil]]", "[[Sex|male and female]]", "[[Size|great and small]]", etc., does  not create oxymorons, as it is not implied that any given object has the two opposing properties simultaneously.
In some languages, it is not necessary to place a conjunction like ''and'' between the two antonyms; such compounds (not necessarily of antonyms) are known as [[dvandva]]s (a term taken from [[Sanskrit grammar]]). 
For example, in Chinese, compounds like  男女 (man and woman, male and female, gender), 阴阳 ([[yin and yang]]), 善恶 (good and evil, morality)  are used to indicate couples, ranges, or the trait that these are extremes of.
The Italian ''[[pianoforte]]'' or ''[[fortepiano]]'' is an example from a Western language; the term is short for ''gravicembalo col piano e forte'', as it were "harpiscord with a range of different volumes", implying that it is possible to play both soft and loud (as well as intermediate) notes, not that the sound produced is somehow simultaneously "soft and loud".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4368">'''Paratext''' is a concept in [[literature|literary interpretation]].  The [[Text (literary theory)|main text]] of published authors (e.g. the story, non-fiction description, poems, etc.) is often surrounded by other material supplied by the authors, editors, printers, and publishers, which is known as the paratext. These added elements form a frame for the main text, and can change the reception of a text or its interpretation by the public. Paratext is most often associated with [[book]]s, as they typically include a cover (with associated [[cover art]]), title, [[Book design#Front matter|front matter]] (dedication, opening information, foreword), [[Book design#Back matter (end matter)|back matter]] (endpapers, colophon) footnotes, and many other materials not crafted by the author. Other editorial decisions can also fall into the category of paratext, such as the formatting or typography. Because of their close association with the text, it may seem that authors should be given the final say about paratextual materials, but often that is not the case. One example of controversy surrounding paratext is the case of the 2009 young adult novel ''[[Liar (novel)|Liar]]'', which was initially published with an image of a white girl on the cover, although the narrator of the story was identified in the text as black.

The concept of paratext is closely related to the concept of [[hypotext]], which is the earlier text that serves as a source for the current text.

==Theory==
[[literary theory|Literary theorist]] [[Gérard Genette]] defines paratext as those things in a published work that accompany the text, things such as the author's name, the title, [[preface]] or [[introduction (essay)|introduction]], or [[illustration]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Genette ''Paratexts: Thresholds of Interpretation'' page 1&lt;/ref&gt;
Genette states "More than a boundary or a sealed border, the paratext is, rather, a threshold." It is "a zone between text and off-text, a zone not only of transition but also of transaction: a privileged place of pragmatics and a strategy, of an influence on the public, an influence that ... is at the service of a better reception for the text and a more pertinent reading of it". Then quoting [[Philippe Lejeune]], Genette further describes paratext as "a fringe of the printed text which in reality controls one's whole reading of the text". This threshold consists of a peritext, consisting of elements such as titles, chapter titles, prefaces and notes. It also includes an epitext, which consists of elements such as interviews, publicity announcements, reviews by and addresses to critics, private letters and other authorial and editorial discussions – 'outside' of the text in question. The paratext is the sum of the peritext and epitext.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Intertextuality|last=Allen|first=Graham|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=978-0-415-17475-6|location=USA and Canada|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4111">'''Platform magic''' (also known as '''parlor magic''', '''club magic''' or '''cabaret magic''') is [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] that is done for larger audiences than [[close-up magic]] and for smaller audiences than [[stage magic]]. It is more intimate than stage magic because it doesn't require expensive, large-scale stage equipment and can thus be performed closer to the audience and without a stage. Many of the tricks performed by platform magicians are sufficiently angle-sensitive as to make them impossible to perform as [[micromagic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Magic Tricks for Grown-Ups | publisher=Thomas Dunne Books | author=Tremaine, Jon | year=2006 | location=New York, New York | pages=80–81 | isbn=0-312-34940-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most working magicians are parlor/platform magicians.

Many magicians consider the term "parlor" to be old-fashioned and limiting, since this type of magic is often done in rooms much larger than the traditional parlor, or even outdoors. According to the ''Encyclopedia of Magic and Magicians'' by [[T.A. Waters]], "The phrase [parlor magic] is often used as a pejorative to imply that an effect under discussion is not suitable for professional performance."

Parlor, or club, magicians generally work without assistants and within a few miles of their homes (unlike stage magicians, who may have several in their crew – both backstage and on stage – and may travel thousands of miles between jobs).  This is because payment is less for parlor magicians (but still generally more than for close-up performers). Performances of this category of magic include civic and fraternal organizations, business groups, private parties, youth groups, church societies, public dinners, and similar venues.

Common platform magic tricks include the "[[Miser's Dream]]" (where a seemingly endless supply of coins is produced from thin air), sucker tricks (like the "die box", where a giant die is put in a two-compartment box; the magician makes it vanish but the audience believe he simply shifts it to the other compartment; eventually the magician opens both sides of the box and the die is gone; it has appeared in a previously-empty hat); audience participation tricks (like the breakaway wand, where a wand remains rigid for the magician but falls apart every time the volunteer touches it); production effects (like the square circle, in which a bottomless, topless box with a screened front encloses a bottomless, topless cylinder. Both are shown empty and put together again; the magician then produces large quantities of silk scarves, fruit, bottles, and so on from the "empty" cylinder, inside the square box); and so on. There are countless effects that could be considered as fitting into this classification.

'''Polyphony''' ({{lang-ru|полифония}}) is a concept taken up by [[literary theory]], [[speech act]] theory and [[linguistics]] to refer to the simultaneity of points of view and voices within a particular narrative plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Belova, King, Sliwa|first1=Olga, Ian, Martyna|title=Introduction: Polyphony and Organization Studies: Mikhail Bakhtin and Beyond|journal=Organizational Studies|date=April 1, 2008|volume=29|issue=4|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0170840608088696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Günthner|first1=Susanne|title=Polyphony and the ‘layering of voices’ in reported dialogues: An analysis of the use of prosodic devices in everyday reported speech|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|date=May 1999|volume=31|issue=5|pages=685–708|doi=10.1016/s0378-2166(98)00093-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was introduced by [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], using a metaphor based on the musical term [[polyphony]].

Bakhtin's primary example of polyphony was [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s prose. Bakhtin contended that Dostoevsky, unlike previous novelists, did not provide a 'single vision', or describe situations with a 'monological' authorial voice. Instead, he aimed for fully dramatic [[novel of ideas|novels of ideas]] in which conflicting views and characters are left to develop unevenly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saul Morson, Emerson|first1=Gary, Caryl|title=Mikhail Bakhtin: Creation of a Prosaics|date=1990|publisher=Stanford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bakhtin, the chief characteristic of Dostoevsky's novels is "''a plurality of independent and unmerged voices and consciousnesses, a genuine polyphony of fully valid voices''". His major characters are, "by the very nature of his creative design, ''not only objects of authorial discourse but also subjects of their own directly signifying discourse.''" (italics in the original)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bakhtin|first1=Mikhail|title=Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics|date=1984|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|pages=6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Communication}}
{{Performing arts}}
'''Public speaking''' (also called '''oratory''' or '''oration''') is the process or act of performing a good [[Speech communication|speech]] to a live [[audience]]. This type of speech is deliberately structured with three general purposes: to inform, to persuade and to entertain. Public speaking is commonly understood as formal, face-to-face speaking of a single person to a group of listeners.&lt;ref&gt;''General Purposes of Speaking''. 2012books.lardbucket.org. Retrieved 2016-11-04.{{ISBN needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public speaking can be governed by different rules and structures. For example, speeches about concepts do not necessarily have to be structured in any special way. However, there is a method behind giving it effectively. For this type of speech it would be good to describe that concept with examples that can relate to the audiences life. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Speaker The Tradition and practice of public speaking|last=Valenzano III|first=Joseph M.|last2=Braden|first2=Stephen W.|publisher=Fountainhead press|year=2012|isbn=978-1-59871-522-4|location=United States of America|pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
There are five basic elements of public speaking that are described in [[Lasswell's model of communication]]: the communicator, message, medium, audience and effect. In short, the speaker should be answering the question "''who'' says ''what'' in which ''channel'' to ''whom'' with what ''effect''?"

Public speaking can serve the purpose of transmitting information, telling a story, motivating people to act or some combination of those. Public speaking can also take the form of a [[discourse community]], in which the audience and speaker use discourse to achieve a common goal.

Public speaking for business and commercial events is often done by professionals. These speakers can be contracted independently, through representation by a [[speakers bureau]], or by other means. Public speaking plays a large role in the professional world; in fact, it is believed that 70 percent of all jobs involve some form of public speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Lisa.

However, the most significant records are found among the ancient Greeks.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first known piece&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, James J.  [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Demosthenes-Greek-statesman-and-orator "Demosthenes – greatest Greek orator".] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; on oratory, written over 2,000 years ago, came from ancient Greece. This work elaborated on principles drawn from the practices and experiences of ancient Greek orators. [[Aristotle]] was one of the first recorded teachers of oratory to use definitive rules and models. His emphasis on oratory led to oration becoming an essential part of a [[liberal arts]] education during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. The [[classical antiquity]] works written by the ancient Greeks capture the ways they taught and developed the art of public speaking thousands of years ago.

In classical [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[rhetoric]] was the main component of [[Composition studies|composition]] and speech delivery, both of which were critical skills for citizens to use in public and private life. In ancient Greece, citizens spoke on their own behalf rather than having professionals, like modern lawyers, speak for them. Any [[citizen]] who wished to succeed in court, in politics or in social life had to learn techniques of public speaking. Rhetorical tools were first taught by a group of rhetoric teachers called [[Sophists]] who are notable for teaching paying students how to speak effectively using the methods they developed.

Separately from the Sophists, [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] all developed their own theories of public speaking and taught these principles to students who wanted to learn skills in rhetoric. Plato and Aristotle taught these principles in schools that they founded, [[Platonic Academy|The Academy]] and [[Aristotles Lyceum|The Lyceum]], respectively. Although Greece eventually lost political sovereignty, the Greek culture of training in public speaking was adopted almost identically by the Romans.

In the political rise of the [[Roman Republic]], Roman orators copied and modified the ancient Greek techniques of public speaking. Instruction in rhetoric developed into a full curriculum, including instruction in grammar (study of the poets), preliminary exercises ([[progymnasmata]]), and preparation of public speeches (declamation) in both [[Forensic linguistics|forensic]] and [[Deliberative rhetoric|deliberative]] genres.

The Latin style of rhetoric was heavily influenced by [[Cicero]] and involved a strong emphasis on a broad education in all areas of [[Humanities|humanistic study]] in the liberal arts, including philosophy. Other areas of study included the use of wit and humor, the [[Pathos|appeal to the listener's emotions]], and the use of [[digression]]s. Oratory in the [[Roman empire]], though less central to political life than in the days of the Republic, remained significant in law and became a big form of entertainment. Famous orators became like celebrities in ancient Rome—very wealthy and prominent members of society.

The Latin style was the primary form of oration until the beginning of the 20th century. After [[World War II]], however, the Latin style of oration began to gradually grow out of style as the trend of ornate speaking became seen as impractical. This cultural change likely had to do with the rise of the [[scientific method]] and the emphasis on a "plain" style of speaking and writing. Even formal oratory is much less ornate today than it was in the Classical Era.

Despite the shift in style, the best-known examples of strong public speaking are still studied ''years'' after their delivery. Among these examples are [[Pericles' Funeral Oration]] in 427 BCE addressing those that died during the [[Peloponnesian War]]; Abraham Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]] in 1863; Sojourner Truth's identification of racial issues in "[[Ain't I a Woman?]]”; and Mahatma Gandhi's message of nonviolent resistance in India, which in turn inspired Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech at the Washington Monument in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;German, Kathleen M. (2010). ''Principles of Public Speaking''. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0-205-65396-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tools ==
In addition to simple oratory skills, tools and technologies have been created which allow for more methods of communication for speakers and public orators. [[Lectern]]s hold papers while speakers talk. A speaker can project his or her voice with the aid of a [[public address system]] or a [[microphone]] and [[loudspeaker]] when speaking in front of a large audience. Public speakers may also use [[audience response systems]], allowing listeners to interact with the speech as it happens.

Telecommunication and [[videoconferencing]] are also a form of public speaking. David M. Fetterman of [[Stanford University]] wrote in his 1997 article ''Videoconferencing over the Internet'': "Videoconferencing technology allows geographically disparate parties to hear and see each other usually through satellite or telephone [[communication]] systems." This technology is helpful for large conference meetings and face-to-face communication between parties without demanding the inconvenience of travel.

[[Image:Theodor Kittelsen, Soria Moria.jpg|right|thumb|"[[Soria Moria Castle|Soria Moria]]" by [[Theodor Kittelsen]]:  a hero glimpses the end of his quest.]]
{{Fantasy}}
{{Speculative fiction|cTopic=Fantasy fiction}}

A '''quest''' is a journey toward a specific mission or a goal. The word serves as a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] device in [[mythology]] and [[fiction]]: a difficult [[Travel|journey]] towards a goal, often [[symbol]]ic or [[Allegory|allegorical]].  Tales of quests figure prominently in the [[folklore]] of every nation&lt;ref&gt;Josepha Sherman, ''Once upon a Galaxy'' p 142 {{ISBN|0-87483-387-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic culture]].  In [[literature]], the object of a quest requires great exertion on the part of the [[hero]], who must overcome many obstacles, typically including much travel.  The aspect of travel allows the storyteller to showcase exotic locations and cultures (an objective of the narrative, not of the character).&lt;ref&gt;Michael O. Riley, Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L. Frank Baum, p 178-9, {{ISBN|0-7006-0832-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The object of a quest may also have [[supernatural]] properties, often leading the protagonist into other worlds and dimensions. The [[moral]] of a quest tale often centers on the changed [[Moral character|character]] of the hero.

==Quest objects==

[[Image:TheKnightAtTheCrossroads.jpg|left|thumb|''A Knight at the Crossroads'' by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]]]

The hero normally aims to obtain something or someone by the quest, and with this object to return home.&lt;ref&gt;
[[W. H. Auden]], "The Quest Hero", ''Understanding the Lord of the Rings: The Best of Tolkien Criticism'', p35 {{ISBN|0-618-42253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object can be something new, that fulfills a lack in his life, or something that was stolen away from him or someone with authority to dispatch him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale, p 36, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the hero has no desire to return; Sir [[Galahad]]'s quest for the [[Holy Grail]] is to find it, not return with it. A return may, indeed, be impossible: [[Aeneas]] quests for a homeland, having lost Troy at the beginning of [[Virgil]]'s ''Aeneid,'' and he does not return to Troy to re-found it but settles in Italy (to become an ancestor of the Romans).

If the hero does return after the culmination of the quest, he may face [[false hero]]es who attempt to pass themselves off as him,&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p60, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt; or his initial response may be a rejection of that return, as [[Joseph Campbell]] describes in his critical analysis of quest literature, ''[[The Hero With a Thousand Faces]]''.

If someone dispatches the hero on a quest, the overt reason may be false, with the dispatcher actually sending him on the difficult quest in hopes of his death in the attempt, or in order to remove him from the scene for a time, just as if the claim were sincere, except that the tale usually ends with the dispatcher being unmasked and punished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p77 {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stories with such false quest-objects include the legends of [[Jason]] and [[Perseus]], the fairy tales ''[[The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird]]'', ''[[Go I Know Not Whither and Fetch I Know Not What]]'', and the story of [[Beren and Lúthien]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]''.

The quest object may, indeed, function only as a convenient reason for the hero's journey. Such objects are termed [[MacGuffin]]s. When a hero is on a quest for several objects that are only a convenient reason for his journey, they are termed plot coupons.

==Literary analysis==
The quest, in the form of the [[Monomyth#The Hero's Journey|Hero's Journey]], plays a central role in the [[Monomyth]] described by [[Joseph Campbell]]; the hero sets forth from the world of common day into a land of adventures, tests, and magical rewards.  Most times in a quest, the knight in shining armor wins the heart of a beautiful maiden/ princess.

==Historical examples==
An early quest story tells the tale of [[Gilgamesh]], who seeks a secret to eternal life after the death of [[Enkidu]], including the search for an [[emerald]].

Another ancient quest tale, [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', tells of [[Odysseus]], whom the gods have cursed to wander and suffer for many years before [[Athena]] persuades the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]] to allow him to return home.  Recovering the [[Golden Fleece]] is the object of the travels of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] in the ''[[Argonautica]]''. [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche]], having lost Cupid, hunted through the world for him, and was set tasks by [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], including a descent into the [[underworld]].

Many [[fairy tale]]s depict the hero or heroine setting out on a quest, such as:

* ''[[East of the Sun and West of the Moon]]'' where the heroine seeks her husband
* ''[[The Seven Ravens]]'' where the heroine seeks her transformed brothers
* ''[[The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was]]''
* ''[[The Golden Bird]]'' where the prince sets out to find the golden bird for his father

Other characters may set out with no more definite aim than to "seek their fortune", or even be cast out instead of voluntarily leaving, but learn of something that could aid them along the way and so have their journey transformed from aimless wandering into a quest.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p63, {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other characters can also set forth on quests — the hero's older brothers commonly do — but the hero is distinguished by his success.

[[Image:Galahad grail.jpg|left|360px|thumb|"Vision of the Holy Grail" (1890) by [[William Morris]]]]

Many medieval [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] sent knights out on quests. The term "[[Knight-errant]]" sprang from this, as ''errant'' meant "roving" or "wandering".  Sir [[Thomas Malory]] included many in ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''.  The most famous—perhaps in all of western literature—centers on the [[Holy Grail]] in [[Arthurian legend]].  This [[monomyth|story cycle]] recounts multiple quests, in multiple variants, telling stories both of the heroes who succeed, like [[Percival]] (in [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s [[Parzival]]) or Sir [[Galahad]] (in the [[Queste del Saint Graal]]), and also the heroes who fail, like Sir [[Lancelot]].  This often sent them into a bewildering [[enchanted forest|forest]].  Despite many references to its pathlessness, the forest repeatedly confronts knights with forks and crossroads, of a labyrinthine complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 177, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The significance of their encounters is often explained to the knights—particularly those searching for the [[Holy Grail]]—by [[hermit]]s acting as [[wise old man|wise old men -- or women]].&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 179-81, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Still, despite their perils and chances of error, such forests, being the location where the knight can obtain the end of his quest, are places where the knights may become worthy; one romance has a maiden urging Sir Lancelot on his quest for the Holy Grail, "which quickens with life and greenness like the forest."&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 181, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So consistently did knights quest that [[Miguel de Cervantes]] set his [[Don Quixote]] on mock quests in a parody of chivalric tales. Nevertheless, while Don Quixote was a fool, he was and remains a hero of chivalry.

==Modern literature==
Quests continued in modern literature.  Analysis can interpret many (perhaps most) stories as a quest in which the main character is seeking something that he desires,&lt;ref&gt;Robert McKee, ''Story:  Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting'', p 196-7 {{ISBN|0-06-039168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the literal structure of a journey seeking something is, itself, still common.  Quests often appear in [[fantasy]] literature,&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Quest ", p 796 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in [[Rasselas]] by [[Samuel Johnson]], or ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', where Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion go on a quest for the way back to Kansas, brains, a heart, and courage respectively.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p 126-7, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quests, also, play a major role in [[Rick Riordan]]'s fantasy books, among them ''[[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]]'', ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'', and ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]''.

A familiar modern literary quest is [[Frodo Baggins]]'s quest to destroy the [[One Ring]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. H. Auden]], "The Quest Hero", ''Understanding the Lord of the Rings:  The Best of Tolkien Criticism'', p45 {{ISBN|0-618-42253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The One Ring, its baleful power, the difficult method which is the only way to destroy it, and the spiritual and psychological torture it wreaks on its Bearer; [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] uses all these elements to tell a meaningful tale of [[friendship]] and the inner struggle with [[temptation]], against a background of [[epic poetry|epic]] and supernatural warfare.

''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' is often thought of as a quest plot, detailing Holden's search not for a tangible object but for a sense of purpose or reason.

Some writers, however, may devise arbitrary quests for items without any importance beyond being the object of the quest.  These items are known as [[MacGuffin]]s, which is sometimes merely used to compare quests and is not always a derogatory term.  Writers may also motivate characters to pursue these objects by meanings of a [[Self-fulfilling prophecy#Literature, media, and the arts|prophecy]] that decrees it, rather than have them discover that it could assist them, for reasons that are given.

'''''RollerJam''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[television series]] featuring [[roller derby]] that aired on [[The Nashville Network]] (TNN, now [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]]) from 1999 to 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482031/fullcredits|title=RollerJam (TV Series 1999–2000)|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first attempt to bring roller derby to TV since [[RollerGames]].

''RollerJam'' was derived from the original roller derby, but newer skaters used [[inline skates]] to modernize the sport (several skaters, mostly older ones, used the traditional [[quad skates]]). The program was taped at [[Universal Studios]] Stage 21 in [[Orlando, Florida]], known as ''RollerJam Arena'' and now the [[Impact Wrestling Zone]], for the first and second seasons (1999 and 2000) and the former ''[[American Gladiators]]'' arena in the show's final season. The first few weeks of the show's second season, which ran from August to October 1999, were taped at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas]].

==Creation==

''RollerJam'' was the brainchild of [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]-based television impresarios [[Ross K. Bagwell, Sr.]] and [[Stephen Land]]. Land, a fan of roller derby in boyhood, was inspired to bring the sport back to television by an [[obituary]] for roller derby legend [[Joan Weston]] that he had read in the ''[[New York Times]]'' in May 1997, and shared his idea with Bagwell, his mentor, who gave him a positive response.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last=Turczyn|first=Coury|url=http://www.popcultmag.com/obsessions/fadsandphenoms/rollerderby/derby2.html|title=Blood on the Tracks|publisher=PopCult Magazine|accessdate=2011-12-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228045852/http://www.popcultmag.com/obsessions/fadsandphenoms/rollerderby/derby2.html|archivedate=2008-02-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between January 1999 and January 2001,&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.tv.com/rollerjam/show/11373/episode_listings.html?season=0 RollerJam Episode List at TV.com] confirms there were 100 episodes, comprising four seasons, that aired between January 1999 and January 2001, plus a preview/pilot episode in December 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Bagwell and Land, under the name Pageboy Entertainment, collaborated with [[CBS]] to stage this new televised revival of roller derby.&lt;!--Google reveals roughly equal numbers of references to each--&gt;

In May 1998, Bagwell and Land pitched their idea to [[The Nashville Network]] (TNN). The network agreed to air the show but wanted it ready by the new year, forcing Bagwell and Land to create a league, recruit skaters, build a track, design logos and uniforms, hire a television crew, and record the program all in a span of about seven months. In an attempt to build continuity between ''RollerJam'' and previous roller derby incarnations, Bagwell and Land hired [[Jerry Seltzer]], the son of roller derby creator [[Leo Seltzer]], to be commissioner of their new league. The first episode of the show was taped in November 1998, a week after [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Overview==
''RollerJam'' featured several teams of skaters competing in the fictional World Skating League (WSL). Jerry Seltzer served as on-screen WSL commissioner, although he only made a few appearances. The initial teams, each consisting of seven men and seven women, were the New York Enforcers, California Quakes, Florida Sundogs, Nevada Hot Dice, Texas Rustlers, and Illinois Riot (the original names of the latter three teams were the Las Vegas High Rollers, Texas Twisters, and Illinois Inferno; their names were changed prior to the start of the first season). Two notable veterans from Roller Games, "Rockin'" Ray Robles and "Latin Spitfire" Patsy Delgato, were featured in the second season of ''RollerJam''. Despite strong funding and four seasons of broadcasts on TNN, the venture never became a "live" attraction. Fabricated storylines and characters in the mode of [[professional wrestling]] were being featured more than actual competitive skating around season 3 and 4, raising the ire of many skaters and fans of true roller derby.

==Rulesheets==
===Periods===

Games were played in four 6-minute periods with as many 60-second jams as possible; women skated odd numbered periods, and the men skated the even-numbered periods.  (In traditional roller derby, the game has eight 12-minute periods, again with 60-second jams.)  Jams began and ended on the referee's whistle, and a buzzer sounded to reinforce this.

===Skaters===

Whereas traditional derby employs a pivot skater, RollerJam did not use one.  Instead, each team had 3 blockers, each wearing a white helmet, and two jammers, each wearing a black helmet with red stripes.  In-line skates were legalized in attempt to modernize the sport, but certain skaters opted still to use the quad skates.

===Jams===

In seasons 1-2, the game was played like traditional derby in that the first jam began from the black start/finish line, while the skaters had to continuously skate until a time-out was called or the period ended.  In seasons 3-4, this changed to every single jam starting from a standstill start from the black line.  In either case, jammers had to start from the back of the pack (the whole group) and work their way through, with the first jammer to break out winning the status of lead jammer.  The skaters then got one point for every opponent they successfully lapped.  The lead jammer could cut off the jam early by placing their hands on their hips.

The last jam of the last period always went the full minute regardless of what the period clock showed.

===Penalties===

At the referee's discretion, skaters would sit in a [[penalty box]] for violating the rules for various reasons, from 1-2 jams, or face immediate disqualification (ejection) from the game.  Skaters frequently racked up these penalties and were willing to take it if they felt it would bring them a [[moral victory]].

===Winning===

The team with the most points won the game.  If the game was tied in regulation, originally the genders would continue to alternate in sudden death overtime periods until there was a clear winner but instead one skater from each team face-off in a Tiebreaker Match Race, 5 laps around the track and whoever crosses the finish line first wins the game for their team.

==Special Features==

In addition, special features would occasionally pop up:

:'''Half-time Match races:''' Usually played between 2 or more skaters to either settle the score with another rival skater or to compete for the "Jammer" title belt. 

Another unique concept was that Rollerjam held special games, races and competitions in certain episodes, such as:

:'''The Rollerjam All-Star game:''' Played between Company D led by Mark D'Amato and the Crazy 8's headed by Sean Atkinson, both stocked with an all-star roster of each team's key men and women skaters in the WSL. 

:'''Last Man Standing:''' A tie-breaker when both teams have equal points by the final period of and have to compete in a no time limit, no penalty game in a team variation of battle royal, to determine a winner. The objective of the tie-breaker is for skaters of both teams is to eliminate the opposing skaters by knocking them over the rails or in the infield of the track until one team wins, earning the winning team 15 points.

:'''Men and Women Demolition Derby:''' A special contest in the vein of the [[Royal Rumble]] where the WSL skaters compete in separate interval contests both assigned for male and female skaters, which starts with 3 or 4 skaters on the track. A new skater enters the track every 20 or 14 seconds in the order voted by fans at the Rollerjam website. The contest will keep going, until all the skaters, except the winner, has been eliminated by either being knocked over the rails or in the track's infield.  

:'''Table Race''' Skaters race 4 laps while avoiding crashing into the 2 tables set up on the track to evade elimination from the race. 

:'''Nightgown and Lingerie race:''' Similar to a Bra and Panties match, where the female skaters are dressed up in their outfits and must race 4 laps without getting their outfits stripped, destroyed, or get themselves knocked off the track, resulting in an elimination from the race). 

:'''Fastest man or woman on skates race:''' 5 of 1 jammer skater of each team race each other on the track, 7 laps, the first jammer crossing the finish line wins the race. 

:'''Quad Race:''' A race played between Mark D'Amato and Ray Robles, the winner keeps the quad skates, loser wears inline skates for the rest of the season.

==Actors==

Three of the most notable actors featured in ''RollerJam'' were veteran movie actor Tom Nowicki (who played WSL general manager Kenneth Loge III and Sundogs manager Leonard Loge III), Cindy Maranne (who played Amanda Hertz, the manager of the Nevada Hot Dice), former [[ESPN]] and current [[CBS Sports Network]] play-by-play commentator James Bates (who played "The Prophet", a character in Season 4 only who would interrupt games to make speeches, and later managed the Sundogs), and stage actress and former [[Mickey Mouse Club|Mouseketeer]] [[Lindsey Alley]] (who played Lisa Seltzer, the "granddaughter" of Leo Seltzer). Other characters included Julie Amazon (a bodybuilding skater in Season 4), Canine and Disable (minions of The Prophet who skated for the Sundogs, and "captured" Lindsay Francis during the first game of Season 4),Devo (a convict character who skated for the Hot Dice), Lil Nasty (A midget who is a sidekick to Tim Washington) and El Numero (A masked luchador Who skated for the Enforcers).

The most points ever scored in one jam was 28 in Period 3 of a game between the New York Enforcers and the Illinois Riot.  The Riot came back from a 20+ point deficit to win 46-43 in the highest scoring game in RollerJam history. Roller Derby legend [[Ann Calvello]], best known for her brutal feuds with [[Joan Weston]], skated a match race with Kenneth Loge III in ''RollerJam'''s finale. She emerged victorious.

==Criticism==

Ron Buffone, a producer for [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW), called ''RollerJam'' "That stupid roller blading show".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Rise and Fall of ECW]]'' DVD, WWE Home Video&lt;/ref&gt; Buffone believed that TNN treated ''[[ECW on TNN]]'', which aired prior to ''RollerJam'' on Friday nights, as a lead-in for ''RollerJam'' rather than a show in its own right, despite the fact that the ECW broadcast generated the network's highest ratings. Nevertheless, some cross-promotion between the two programs did occur, notably when ECW wrestlers such as [[Axl Rotten]] and [[Tommy Dreamer]] appeared on ''RollerJam'' as "enforcers" for the Florida Sundogs against the New York Enforcers.

==Key players==

===Men===
*'''Sean Atkinson''', men's captain of the California Quakes. Atkinson is the first third generation skater in roller derby history.  His parents Buddy (Jr.) and Dru Atkinson and his grandparents Buddy (Sr.) and Bobbie Atkinson all skated for Leo Seltzer's original derby.  He now manages the Orlando Thunder in the [[American Roller Skating Derby]] (San Francisco Bay Bombers' league).  His younger brother, Seth, is also a skater and helps run the XSL (Xtreme Skating League), which is an independent hardcore roller derby promotion equivalent to the old ECW style of wrestling. Coincidentally, Seth is also a trained professional wrestler as well.
*'''Bill Barker''', In Season 1, he originally skated for the Nevada Hot Dice who was later traded to the Florida Sundogs for Richard Brown. Nicknamed "Captain America". In Season 4, he later skated with the Illinois Riot and California Quakes before returning to the Hot Dice in series finale.
*'''Richard Brown''', manager/skater for three teams: Florida Sundogs, Nevada Hot Dice, and Illinois Riot.  Nicknamed "The King", he skated in the Los Angeles T-Birds' league in the 1970s and for the Maniacs on ''[[RollerGames]]'' in 1989.
*'''Mark D'Amato''', men's captain, leader, and later "owner" of the New York Enforcers. Known as the team's (and league's) main villain or "[[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]," paralleling characters and storylines from [[professional wrestling]]. In a storyline, he was revealed to be Sean Atkinson's brother. Later skated in the ARDL. Known as "The Quadfather" because he used old-school four wheeled skates, Mark started skating professionally on Roller Games in Los Angeles in the 1970s, which allowed him to be grandfathered under league rules. D'Amato died in March 2002 of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
*'''[[Brian Gamble]]''', a skater for the New York Enforcers, Texas Rustlers, and Illinois Riot. Nicknamed "The Blade", he is now a professional wrestler.
*'''Micah Martin''', a speed skating champion who competed for the Nevada Hot Dice and Florida Sundogs. He's the brother of Sam Martin. Would colour his hair to match his team colours.
*'''Sam Martin''', a speed skating champion who skated for the Florida Sundogs and brother of Micah Martin of the Nevada Hot Dice and Florida Sundogs. Nicknamed "The Flame" due to his bright red hair and speed.
*'''Jason McDaniel''', a skater for the Nevada Hot Dice who formed the "X-Men" duo with teammate Mark Weber. Now skates for the team "Your Mom Men's Roller Derby".
*'''Ray Robles''' of the Illinois Riot, a 1970s Los Angeles T-Birds veteran and play for the Rockers on Rollergames in 1989 who threw pepper into the faces of opposing skaters. Like Mark D'Amato, he wore the old "quad" skates instead of inline skates.
*'''[[Mo Sanders]]''', a skater for the Illinois Riot, now owns Heartless Wheels, skates with Puget Sound Outcast Derby, and coaches the [[Rat City Rollergirls]]. He also jam-skated in the films [[Roll Bounce]] and [[Enchanted (2007 film)|Enchanted]].
*'''[[Pasi Schalin]]''', a [[Finnish people|Finnish]] former professional [[ice hockey]] player who skated for the Florida Sundogs and California Quakes. His wife Susanne Schalin also skated for both teams.
*'''Eric Slopey''' of the California Quakes, who was involved in the biggest crash in ''RollerJam'' history when he jumped from the inside of the track over the rail and landed into the scorers' table. Would do a dance called the "White Pony" when he was out alone on a breakaway, which earned him that same nickname.
*'''Tim Washington''', the "enforcer" of the Enforcers and formerly "Titan" of the ''[[American Gladiators]]''. Nicknamed "Big Nasty". A cousin of professional boxer [[Marvin Hagler]], both he and Brian "The Blade" Gamble are now professional wrestlers.
*'''Mark Weber''', who skated for the Nevada Hot Dice and formed a duo known as the "X-Men" with teammate Jason McDaniel. Now skates with the [[Cincinnati Battering Rams]] and coaches for the [[Cincinnati Rollergirls]]. Mark is also a member of the 2014 Men's Roller Derby Team USA.  Team USA won the First ever Men's World Cup in Birmingham England in March 2014.

===Women===

*'''Jannet Abraham''' of the New York Enforcers and Florida Sundogs, the biggest, toughest female blocker in the league. She was essentially the female counterpart of Mark D'Amato while on the Enforcers. Nicknamed the "Minister of Pain" in reference to her career as an ordained [[Christianity|Christian]] minister.
*'''Stacey Blitsch''', women's captain of the California Quakes and leader of the "Bod Squad" faction, which would skate out onto the track together and do a dance called the "Quake Shake." Nicknamed "Malibu Stacy" She later skated in the [[American Roller Derby League]] for the Bay City Bombers.
*'''Shay Brown''', women's captain of the Nevada Hot Dice. A tall, powerful skater, she was the leader of the "Showgirls" faction on the Hot Dice. Nicknamed "The Warrior Princess".
*'''Jaime Conemac''', who played for the California Quakes and was a member of their "Bod Squad" faction. She played a ditzy blonde [[bimbo]] character and in Season 4 she hosted a gossip segment on the show called "Chatty Chat with Conemac."
*'''Amy Craig''', played for the California Quakes and later the Illinois Riot. She was a member of the "Oral Authority" during Season 4 with the Riot.  Arguably the fastest skater in ''RollerJam''.
*'''Lindsey Francis''', a skater who skated twice for the Florida Sundogs and also had stints with the Texas Rustlers and New York Enforcers. Although she played a "good girl" character with the Sundogs, over time she became more and more cunning and manipulative, leading to her joining the Enforcers.
*'''Heather Gunnin''', the New York Enforcers' lead female jammer. After being out of action for Season 2 due to broken leg, she returned for Season 3 and nicknamed herself "Leather" because of the type of clothing she preferred to wear.
*'''Denise Loden''', women's captain of the Florida Sundogs and Illinois Riot and she's the leader of the Riot's "Oral Authority" faction during Season 4. She gradually morphed into an assertive character who would wear revealing gold-coloured tops while with the Sundogs before adding purple when she joined the Riot.
*'''Karen L. Magnussen''', first women's captain of the New York Enforcers and leader of the "Sisters of Suffering" faction. Later skated for the Nevada Hot Dice during season 3 after playing for the Enforcers for Seasons 1 &amp; 2 and first game of Season 3. Known as the most underrated skater in the league, as she preferred to stay out of the limelight in favour of focusing on the sport.
*'''Telisa Miller''', a skater for the Texas Rustlers and New York Enforcers. Nicknamed "The Hellcat", she was one of the more violent skaters in the WSL, as she was more than willing to pull hair, scratch, claw, and get into fistfights on the banked track while with the Enforcers. In Season 2 she lost a match race to Lindsey Francis to determine who would stay on the Rustlers.
*'''Susanne Schalin''', a member of the Florida Sundogs and California Quakes along with her husband, Pasi Schalin.
*'''Laura Weintraub''', a former women's [[ice hockey]] player who skated for the Nevada Hot Dice and Illinois Riot. She was a member of the "Showgirls" while with the Hot Dice and the "Oral Authority" with the Riot for final season. Along with Stacey Blitsch, she now skates for the [[American Roller Derby League]]'s San Francisco Bay Bombers based in San Francisco.

===Non-skaters===

*'''[[Jerry Seltzer]]''', real-life son of roller derby creator [[Leo Seltzer]] and original commissioner of the league.  Disillusioned with the focal point of skating competition giving way to storylines, gimmicks and fictitious characters, he quit ''RollerJam''.
*'''[[Tom Nowicki]]''', a professional actor who played WSL general manager '''Kenneth Loge III''' and his twin brother, Florida Sundogs manager '''Leonard Loge'''. Kenneth Loge was Jerry Seltzer's replacement as head of the WSL. He crusaded for morality in the sport and would not stand for outrageous behaviour on the track, actions which met obvious resistance from the skaters. His character was similar to the [[Don Callis|Cyrus]] character and [[The Network (professional wrestling)|Network]] stable in ECW.  Nowicki is best remembered as a football coach opposite [[Denzel Washington]] in ''[[Remember The Titans]]''.
*'''Jason Bates''', television sports commentator who portrayed '''The Prophet''', lackey for Kenneth Loge III, who began preaching Loge's crusade for morality.  He first appeared in the series' final season premiere sending his sidekicks "Canine" and "Disable" (known as the "Moral Authority") to kidnap newly acquired New York Enforcers female skater Lindsay Francis to make her "pure and wholesome" (similar to wrestler [[Molly Holly]]'s storyline in the WWE).  He would later acquire the Florida Sundogs and turn on Loge.  After the Enforcers defeated the Sundogs, he disappear with the league's new championship belt as the Sundogs were disbanded from the WSL.  Bates would later become announcer for [[ESPN]] and now serves as play-by-play announcer for [[CBS Sports Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssportsnetwork.com/bios/|title=CBS Sports Network Bios|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113102147/http://www.cbssportsnetwork.com/bios|archivedate=13 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He will trade off duties during [[Arena Football League]] telecasts.
*'''[[Lindsey Alley]]''', former [[Mouseketeer]] and current stage actress who played '''Lisa Seltzer''', the "grand-daughter" of Leo Seltzer who tried to form an all-star team to travel overseas (storyline) selecting Jason McDaniel as men's captain and Stacey Blitsch as women's captain.  (Storyline dissolved as the show was ending.)

==Video Game==
A game based on the show was developed by BLAM! and published by [[Electronic Arts]] for the [[playstation]] The Rollerjam game made an appearance as an IGN preview&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/06/rollerjam|title=RollerJam|first=I. G. N.|last=Staff|date=5 June 2000|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. according to Neoseekers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neoseeker.com/rollerjam/|title=RollerJam - Neoseeker|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the RollerJam video game was set for a release in the 2nd quarter of 2002, but contrary to IGN release date, as the game was supposed to be released on 2001. But no other trace of information came through about the game being released or canceled without a confirmation.

The video game itself became featured in Rollerjam as a feud, where the game was announced by EA's Steve Sims, around the halftime of the Nevada Hot Dice Vs. New York Enforcers game on March 21, 2000, during Rollerjams 3rd season &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country.com:80/tnn/rollerjam/front-archive/rjam-204517-f.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000612162445/http://www.country.com:80/tnn/rollerjam/front-archive/rjam-204517-f.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 June 2000|title=Roller Jam on TNN The Nashville Network|date=12 June 2000|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival attempts, failures, and legacy==
* A 1999 attempt to start a form of roller derby in the U.K called RollerBlaze&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/retro/rollerblaze/index.html|title=Roller Blaze UK|website=www.angelfire.com|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. by a small group of mountain bikers, skaters and fitness fanatics during their Summer Vacation after a trip to San Francisco inspired by RollerJam and the [[American Roller Derby League]]. Held a few unofficial derby races on a banked cycle track in London played between the Southern Blue Angels and the South Coast Sun Devils, in hope to achieve the goal of forming a small 'Brit Blaze' league and organize a 'derby' game on a more suitable indoor wooden track. Around 2000 and 2001 when Rollerjam ended, the league was disbanded.

*during the mid-2000 when Rollerjam was at its peak, Bill Griffiths, Sr., creator of the [[Roller games]] and RGI Commissioner, Wanted to bring Rollergames back under the name Rollergames 2000 (or rg2k)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollergames.com/rg2k.htm|title=ROLLERGAMES 2000|date=14 October 2000|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001014235946/http://www.rollergames.com/rg2k.htm|archivedate=14 October 2000|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but without the oversaturated mentality of Rollerjam and the 1989 version of [[rollergames]] had, instead more so in bringing back the caliber and format of play as represented in the 60's, 70's, and early 80's. But could not reach an agreement with the executives &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollergames.com/rg2kpr35.htm|title=ROLLERGAMES 2000 Update|date=21 January 2001|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010121121100/http://www.rollergames.com/rg2kpr35.htm|archivedate=21 January 2001|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Despite the ultimatum, Griffith had optimism and determination to bring back the real Roller games, but the plans were short lived as no agreements were meant. Rollergames 2000 was scrapped. And RGI continues to skate untelevised games.

*Around the time of Roller jam in 1996, a last attempt to get a proper old school roller derby on TV was made under the pilot Roller Derby USA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdwlAj6U7NE&amp;t|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the National Roller Derby League, it featured  Joanie Weston at the age of 62 and Ann Calvallo at the age of 70, and other NRDL skaters. with a game played between the Las Vegas High-Rollers and the Hollywood Stars, The pilot didn't sell, it was considered "The last Jam" and that Classic Roller Derby has ended

*After Rollerjam ended and the WSL folded, Derby veteran Erwin Miller, started Rollersport&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollersport.us/index.cfm|title=Rollersport - The Ultimate Derby Experience|date=9 February 2003|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030209184806/http://www.rollersport.us/index.cfm|archivedate=9 February 2003|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002 in an attempt to revive the sport of roller derby properly, acquiring Former Rollerjam skaters and potential recruits, while still using inline skates and construction of a new track. However, in 2003, complications and opposition made the plans for the revival to fall through and the Rollersport project was scrapped.

*Despite Roller Derby make a return as a slightly popular but niche contemporary sport played on flat track and banked and established under governing bodies such as [[Women's Flat Track Derby Association]] and [[Men's Roller Derby Association]], certain fans feel the ongoing modern version of the once great sport is losing its touch in gameplay, contact, and skating, contradicting what made roller derby an action-packed sport that entertained and interested many, Also too many rules, penalitys, blow out games, and slow derby strategies, are the general problem thats slowing down the game. That's when Roller derby leagues such as the [[American Roller Derby League]], [[National Roller Derby League]], and [[American Roller Skating Derby]] attempt to bring back the traditional old-school professional roller derby sport, offering an alternative to fans who are sick and tired of the mainstream modern roller derby. With the promise of fast-paced skating action, athletic skaters with personality, fights, and legitimate full-contact gameplay. With the help of a couple veteran Roller Games, Roller Derby, and Rollerjam skaters as well who also skated old timer bouts at [[Penn Jersey Roller Derby]] banked track and NRD HOF Memorial Old Timers Game and Reunions on a regulation banked track located in Lali O's Outhoummountry backyard in Vegas. But the concept was met with the opposition of a few league's owner's refusal to let go of the undefeated bias flagship team favoritism focus such as NRDL L.A. Thunderbirds and ARSD San Francisco Bay Bombers overshadowed the league's image of legitimacy, as certain skaters causing intentional trouble scaring off potential talent, and certain leagues owners could not abandon the overly fabricated predetermine format aspects of the set game, thus burning bridges with fans and the roller derby community, the leagues still continue to skate their game at venues such as the Pomona Fairplex, The Cow Palace, and Alameda Fairgrounds unstreamed and untelevised exhibition once a year still drawing in fans who enjoyed the game regardless. Years later, NRDL and roller games owner, Bill Griffiths died on April 6, 2015, and ARSD owner, Dan Ferrari died on December 14, 2016, the league's future plans are uncertain as ARSL has been disbanded.

*in 2016, Another attempt to bring back the unstaged and legit, fast-paced ultra contact, co-ed roller derby game was made under the name Rollergames: New Generation or Rollergames 2016, Only this time using the Japan [[Roller Game]] variation of roller derby gameplay, concept, and ruleset played by the Roller Game League since 1990 to today both on the banked track and flat track. with the help of Jerry Seltzer, [[Los Angeles Derby Dolls]], a few roller derby, roller games, and Rollerjam skaters, Hiroshi Koizumi Roller game Japan creator, and Daruma Entertainment. This exhibition was held at Santa Monica Pier for ROLLER EXPO 2016 and played as a world series game&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY7tkpUJ5qs|title=ローラーゲーム 日米戦 2016 第一試合 第3セット Roller Games JAPAN vs USA Roller Derby|first=|last=exfittv|date=22 April 2017|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHMx34YcJK4|title=ローラーゲーム 日米戦 2016 第一試合 第2セット Roller Games JAPAN vs USA Roller Derby|first=|last=exfittv|date=21 April 2017|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;. with the roller games, Roller Jam, and ARSD skaters representing America and Roller game Japan skaters playing for Japan. it was marketed as the "fastest derby" with its offering of full contact, fast gameplay, and no slowing down penalties and no staged fights or set games. The exhibition was well received by its audience, with 2017 plans still to be made, but never happened, as Hiroshi Koizumi was busy training a roller derby Japan team for the [[Fédération Internationale de Roller Sports]] 2017 roller games held in Nanjing, China. As of now, Roller game is Occasionally played at the RollerXskate Arena held in Tokyo Dome City for Flat battles and X-DOME Skate Park for banked battles. highlights of These games Including the game held at Santa Monica can be seen on exfittv's YouTube channel &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/exfittv/search?query=rollergame|title=exfittv|website=YouTube|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Botticelli - Adoration of the Magi (Zanobi Altar) - Uffizi.jpg|thumb|[[Sandro Botticelli]]'s painting of the ''[[Adoration of the Magi of 1475 (Botticelli)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' has an inserted self-portrait at the far right: the position in the corner and the gaze out to the viewer are very typical of such self-portraits.]]
'''Self-insertion''' is a literary device in which a [[fictional character]], who represents the real author of a work of fiction, appears as an idealized character within that fiction, either overtly or in disguise.&lt;ref name="Goetz2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goetz|first=Sharon K.|title=Terminus: Collected Papers on Harry Potter, 7-11 August 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nffbAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA516|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=2010-04-01|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9780982680704|pages=516–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In art, the equivalent is the '''inserted self-portrait''', where the artist includes a [[self-portrait]] in a painting of a narrative subject. This has been a common artistic device since at least the [[European Renaissance]].

==Related concepts==
This literary device should not be confused with a [[first-person narrator]], an [[author surrogate]], or a character somewhat based on the author, whether the author included it intentionally or not. Many characters have been described as ''unintentional'' self-insertions, implying that their author is unconsciously using them as an author surrogate.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

A '''stunt coordinator''', usually an experienced [[stunt performer]], is hired by a [[TV]], [[film]] or [[theatre]] director or [[production company]] for [[stunt casting]] that is to arrange the casting (stunt players and stunt doubles) and performance of [[stunt]]s for a film, television programme or a live audience.

Where the film requires a [[stunt]], and involves the use of [[stunt performer]]s, the Stunt Coordinator will arrange the casting and performance of the stunt, working closely with the Director.

In many cases, the stunt coordinator budgets, designs and choreographs the stunt sequence to suit the script and the director's vision.

There are two [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Stunt Coordination|Outstanding Stunt Coordination]]—one for Outstanding Stunt Coordination for a Drama Series, Miniseries or Movie and another for Outstanding Stunt Coordination for a Comedy Series or Variety Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pond|first1=Steve|title=New Emmy Rules Say Yes to Funny Stunts, No to Supporting Actors|url=http://www.thewrap.com/awards/column-post/new-emmy-rules-say-yes-funny-stunts-no-supporting-actors-83961/|work=The Wrap|date=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==
{{Main|Fictional universe of The Hunger Games}}
''The Hunger Games'' trilogy takes place in an unspecified future time, in the dystopian, [[Apocalypse|post-apocalyptic]] nation of Panem, located in [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Collins|first=Suzanne|title=The Hunger Games|year=2008|publisher=[[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic Press]]|isbn=0-439-02348-3| page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country consists of a wealthy Capitol city, located in the [[Rocky Mountains]],&lt;ref name="HG_41"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Collins|first=Suzanne|title=The Hunger Games|year=2008|publisher=[[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic Press]]|isbn=0-439-02348-3|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; surrounded by twelve (originally thirteen) poorer districts ruled by the Capitol. The Capitol is lavishly rich and technologically advanced, but the districts are in varying states of poverty. The trilogy's narrator and protagonist [[Katniss Everdeen]], lives in District 12, the poorest region of Panem, located in [[Appalachia]],&lt;ref name="HG_41"/&gt; where people regularly die of starvation. As punishment for a past rebellion against the Capitol (called the "Dark Days"), in which District 13 was supposedly destroyed, one boy and one girl from each of the twelve remaining districts, between the ages of 12 and 18, are selected by lottery to compete in an annual pageant called the Hunger Games. The Games are a televised event in which the participants, called "tributes", are forced to fight to the death in a dangerous public arena. The winning tribute and his/her home district are then rewarded with food, supplies, and riches. The purposes of the Hunger Games are to provide entertainment for the Capitol and to remind the districts of the Capitol's power and lack of [[remorse]],
[[forgetfulness]], and [[forgiveness]] for the failed rebellion of the current competitors' ancestors.

===Structure===
Each book in ''The Hunger Games'' trilogy has three sections of nine chapters each. Collins has said this format comes from her playwriting background, which taught her to write in a [[three-act structure]]; her previous series, ''[[The Underland Chronicles]]'', was written in the same way. She sees each group of nine chapters as a separate part of the story, and comments still call those divisions "act breaks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Collins |first=Suzanne |title=Similarities To Underland |url=http://www.scholastic.com/thehungergames/videos/similarities-to-underland.htm |type=Interview: Video |work=[[Scholastic Canada]] |accessdate=June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
Collins says she drew inspiration for the series from both classical and contemporary sources. Her main classical source of [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]] is the Greek myth of [[Theseus]] and the [[Minotaur]], in which, as a punishment for past crimes, [[Minos]] forces [[Athens]] to sacrifice seven youths and seven maidens to the Minotaur, which kills them in a vast [[labyrinth]]. Collins says that even as a child, she was stunned by the idea since "it was just so cruel" to force Athens to sacrifice its own children.

Collins also cites as a classical inspiration the Roman [[gladiator]] games. She feels three key elements create a good game: an all powerful and ruthless government, people forced to fight to the death, and the game's role as a source of popular entertainment.&lt;ref name="classical"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholastic.com/thehungergames/videos/classical-inspiration.htm |title=Video: Classical Inspiration – The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins|publisher=[[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]]|accessdate=September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contemporary source of inspiration was Collins' recent fascination with [[Reality TV|reality television programs]]. She says they are like ''The Hunger Games'' because the Games are not just entertainment but also a reminder to the districts of their rebellion. On a tired night, Collins says that while she was channel-surfing the television, she saw people competing for some prize and then saw footage of the [[Iraq War]]. She described how the two combined in an "unsettling way" to create her first ideas for the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholastic.com/thehungergames/videos/contemporary-inspiration.htm|title=Video: Contemporary Inspiration – The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins|publisher=Scholastic|accessdate=September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trilogy==
===''The Hunger Games''===
{{Main|The Hunger Games (novel)}}
''The Hunger Games'' is the first book in the series and was released on September 14, 2008.

''The Hunger Games'' follows 16-year-old [[Katniss Everdeen]], a girl from District 12 who volunteers for the 74th Hunger Games in place of her younger sister [[Primrose Everdeen]]. Also selected from District 12 is [[Peeta Mellark]]. They are mentored by their district's only living victor, [[Haymitch Abernathy]], who won 24 years earlier and has since led a solitary life of [[alcoholism]].

Peeta confesses his longtime secret love for Katniss in a televised interview prior to the Games. This revelation stuns Katniss, who harbors feelings for [[Gale Hawthorne]], her friend and hunting partner. Haymitch advises her to feign feelings for Peeta in order to gain wealthy sponsors who can provide crucial supplies to the "[[star-crossed lovers]]" during the Games.

In the arena, Katniss allies with [[Rue (The Hunger Games)|Rue]], a young tribute from District 11 who reminds Katniss of her kid sister. When Rue is killed, Katniss places flowers around her body as an act of defiance toward the Capitol. Then the remaining tributes are alerted to a rule change that allows tributes from the same district to win as a team. Katniss finds a seriously wounded Peeta and nurses him back to health. When all of the other tributes are dead, the rule change is abruptly revoked. With neither willing to kill the other, Katniss comes up with a solution: a double suicide by eating poisonous berries. This forces the authorities to concede just in time to save their lives. During and after the Games, Katniss develops genuine feelings for Peeta and struggles to reconcile them with what she feels for Gale.

Haymitch warns her that the danger is far from over. The authorities are furious at being made fools of, and the only way to try to allay their anger is to pretend that her actions were because of her love for Peeta. On the journey home, Peeta is dismayed to learn of the deception.

===''Catching Fire ''===
{{Main|Catching Fire}}
''Catching Fire'' is the second installment in the series, released on September 1, 2009.

In ''Catching Fire'', which begins six months after the conclusion of ''The Hunger Games'', Katniss learns that her defiance in the previous novel has started a chain reaction that has inspired rebellion in the districts. President Snow threatens to harm Katniss' family and friends if she does not help to defuse the unrest in the districts and marry Peeta. Meanwhile, Peeta has become aware of Katniss' disingenuous love for him, but he has also been informed of Snow's threats, so he promises to help keep up the act to spare the citizens of District 12. Katniss and Peeta tour the districts as victors and plan a public wedding. While they follow Snow's orders and keep up the ruse, Katniss inadvertently fuels the rebellion, and the [[Mockingjays|mockingjay]] pin she wears becomes its symbol. District by district, the citizens of Panem begin to stage uprisings against the Capitol. Snow announces a special 75th edition of the Hunger Games—known as the [[Quarter Quell]]—in which Katniss and Peeta are forced to compete with other past victors, effectively canceling the wedding. At Haymitch's urging, the pair teams up with several other tributes, and manages to destroy the arena and escape the Games. Katniss is rescued by the rebel forces from District 13, and Gale informs her that the Capitol has destroyed District 12, and captured both Peeta and their District 7 ally, [[Johanna Mason]]. Katniss ultimately learns—to her surprise—that she had inadvertently been an integral part of the rebellion all along; her rescue had been jointly planned by Haymitch, [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Plutarch Heavensbee|Plutarch Heavensbee]], and [[Finnick Odair]], among others. After some hesitation Katniss joins the rebels.

===''Mockingjay''===
{{Main|Mockingjay}}
''Mockingjay'', the third and final book in ''The Hunger Games'' series, was released on August 24, 2010.

Most of the districts have rebelled against the Capitol, led by District 13 and its President [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Alma Coin|Alma Coin]]. The Capitol lied about the district being destroyed in the Dark Days. After a [[Mexican standoff]] with the Capitol, the District 13 residents took to living underground and rebuilding their strength. The District 12 survivors find shelter with them. Katniss, after seeing first-hand the destruction wrought on her district, agrees to become the "Mockingjay", the symbol of the rebellion. She sets conditions, however. Peeta, Johanna Mason, [[Annie Cresta]], and [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Enobaria|Enobaria]], fellow Games victors captured by the Capitol, are to be granted immunity. Katniss also demands the privilege of killing Snow, but Coin only agrees to flip for the honor.

For her sake, a rescue mission is mounted that succeeds in rescuing Peeta, Johanna and Annie. However, Peeta has been [[Mind control|brainwashed]] to kill Katniss, and he tries to choke her to death upon their reunion. He undergoes experimental treatment to try to cure him.

After she recovers, Katniss and a team known as the Star Squad, composed of Gale, Peeta, Finnick, a [[Film crew|camera crew]], and various other soldiers, are assigned to film propaganda in relatively quiet combat zones. Katniss, however, decides to go to the Capitol to kill Snow, pretending that Coin gave her that mission. Most of the squad are killed along the way, including recently married Finnick. As Katniss approaches Snow's mansion, she sees a group of Capitol children surrounding it as [[human shield]]s. Suddenly a hovercraft drops silver parachutes on the children, who reach for them, hoping they bear food. Some of the parachutes explode, creating carnage. The advancing rebels send in [[medic]]s, including Prim. Then the rest of the parachutes blow up, killing Prim, just as she spots her sister.

Later, Katniss, also injured, awakens from a [[coma]] to learn that the rebels have won, and Snow is awaiting execution at her hands. When she meets Snow by chance, he claims that it was Coin who secretly ordered the bombings in order to strip away the support of his remaining followers. Coin then asks the surviving victors to vote on a final Hunger Games, involving the children of high-ranking Capitol officials (including Snow's granddaughter). Katniss and Haymitch cast the deciding votes in favor of the scheme. However, at what is supposed to be Snow's execution, Katniss instead kills Coin with her bow. Snow laughs, then dies.

Katniss is tried, but the jury believes she was mentally unfit, and she is sent home to District 12. Both Katniss' mother and Gale take jobs in other districts. Peeta regains his sanity. Katniss settles down with him, and after many years of persuasion by him, she finally agrees to have children. They have a girl and then a boy.

J.C. Maçek III of ''[[PopMatters]]'' stated "While [[The Hunger Games (film series)|the film saga]] does capture the [[action (fiction)|action]] of ''The Hunger Games'', the novels are most assuredly the heart of the story. They are nothing less than 'The Writer’s Cut' of the films themselves."&lt;ref name=PM&gt;{{cite web|work=[[PopMatters]]|url=http://www.popmatters.com/column/the-hunger-games-the-writers-cut-really-is-better/|title='The Hunger Games': The Writer’s Cut Really Is Better|date=20 June 2016|first=J.C.|last=Maçek III}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last book, ''Mockingjay'', was criticized by Dan Shade of ''[[SF Site]]'', who felt that Katniss is a weaker character than her comrades and less resolute in her journey to the Capitol, and that with respect to her vendetta against President Snow, her actions in the finale are inconsistent with her established character.&lt;ref&gt;Shade, Dan (2010).

{{Performing arts}}

'''Theatre''' or '''theater'''&lt;ref&gt;Originally spelled ''theatre'' and ''teatre''. From around 1550 to 1700 or later, the most common spelling was ''theater''. Between 1720 and 1750, ''theater'' was dropped in [[British English]], but was either retained or revived in [[American English]] (''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd edition, 2009, CD-ROM: {{ISBN|978-0199563838}}). Recent dictionaries of American English list ''theatre'' as a less common variant, e.g., ''Random House Webster's College Dictionary'' (1991); ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', 4th edition (2006); ''New Oxford American Dictionary'', third edition (2010); [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/theater ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary'' (2011)].&lt;/ref&gt; is a collaborative form of [[fine art]] that uses live performers, typically [[actor|actors or actresses]], to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and [[stagecraft]] such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marvin Carlson|M. Carlson]], [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/jdtc/article/view/1642/1606 "Psychic  Polyphony"], pp. 35–47 in ''Journal of Dramatic Theory and Criticism'', Fall 1986, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The specific place of the performance is also named by the word "theatre" as derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] θέατρον (théatron, "a place for viewing"), itself from θεάομαι (theáomai, "to see", "to watch", "to observe").

Modern Western theatre comes, in large measure, from the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], from which it borrows technical terminology, classification into genres, and many of its themes, [[stock character]]s, and plot elements. Theatre artist [[Patrice Pavis]] defines theatricality, [[Theatre language|theatrical language]], stage writing and the [[Medium specificity|specificity]] of theatre as synonymous expressions that differentiate theatre from the other [[performing arts]], [[literature]] and [[the arts]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pavis|1998|pp=345–346}}. Drawing on the "[[semiotic]]s" of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], Pavis goes on to suggest that "the specificity of theatrical signs may lie in their ability to use [[Semiotic theory of Charles Sanders Peirce#II. Icon, index, symbol|the three possible functions of signs]]: as [[Iconicity|icon]] ([[Mimesis|mimetically]]), as [[Indexicality|index]] (in the situation of [[enunciation]]), or as symbol (as a [[Semiotics|semiological system]] in the fictional mode). In effect, theatre makes the sources of the words visual and concrete: it indicates {{em|and}} incarnates a fictional world by means of signs, such that by the end of the process of signification and symbolization the spectator has reconstructed a theoretical and aesthetic model that accounts for the dramatic universe."&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern theatre includes performances of [[play (theatre)|plays]] and [[musical theatre]]. The art forms of [[ballet]] and [[opera]] are also theatre and use many conventions such as acting, costumes and staging. They were influential to the development of musical theatre; see those articles for more information.

===Classical and Hellenistic Greece===
[[File:Taormina BW 2012-10-05 16-05-05.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] theatre in [[Taormina]], [[Sicily]]]]
{{Main article|Theatre of ancient Greece}}
[[File:Phlyax scene Louvre CA7249.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A depiction of actors playing the roles of a master (right) and his slave (left) in a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[phlyax play]], circa 350/340 BCE]]
The [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] is where western theatre originated.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 441), Cartledge (1997, 3–5), Goldhill (1997, 54). Brown writes that [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek drama]] "was essentially the creation of [[classical Athens]]: all the dramatists who were later regarded as classics were active at Athens in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE (the time of the [[Athenian democracy]]), and all the surviving plays date from this period" (1998, 441). "The dominant culture of [[Classical Athens|Athens in the fifth century]]", Goldhill writes, "can be said to have invented theatre" (1997, 54).&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of a broader [[culture]] of theatricality and performance in [[classical Greece]] that included [[Athenian festivals|festivals]], [[Religion in ancient Greece|religious rituals]], [[Ancient Greece#Political structure|politics]], [[Ancient Greek law|law]], athletics and gymnastics, [[Music of ancient Greece|music]], [[Ancient Greek literature#Classical and Pre-Classical Antiquity|poetry]], weddings, funerals, and ''[[Symposium|symposia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cartledge (1997, 3, 6), Goldhill (1997, 54) and (1999, 20–xx), and Rehm (1992. 3). Goldhill argues that although activities that form "an integral part of the exercise of citizenship" (such as when "the Athenian citizen speaks in the Assembly, exercises in the gymnasium, sings at the symposium, or courts a boy") each have their "own regime of display and regulation," nevertheless the term "performance" provides "a useful heuristic category to explore the connections and overlaps between these different areas of activity" (1999, 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Participation in the city-state's many festivals—and mandatory attendance at the [[Dionysia#City Dionysia|City Dionysia]] as an audience member (or even as a participant in the theatrical productions) in particular—was an important part of [[citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;Pelling (2005, 83).&lt;/ref&gt; Civic participation also involved the evaluation of the [[rhetoric]] of [[orators]] evidenced in performances in the [[Athenian law court (classical period)|law-court]] or [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|political assembly]], both of which were understood as analogous to the theatre and increasingly came to absorb its dramatic vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhill (1999, 25) and Pelling (2005, 83–84).&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks also developed the concepts of [[dramatic criticism]] and theatre architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Dukore (1974, 31), Janko (1987, ix), and Ward (1945, 1).&lt;!-- These citations only support "criticism" - need others for professional actors and architecture --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Actors were either amateur or at best semi-professional.&lt;ref&gt;novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/spd130et/ancientgreek.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The [[theatre of ancient Greece]] consisted of three types of [[drama]]: [[tragedy]], [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], and the [[satyr play]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–19).&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of theatre in ancient Greece, according to Aristotle (384–322 BCE), the first theoretician of theatre, are to be found in the festivals that honoured Dionysus. The performances were given in semi-circular auditoria cut into hillsides, capable of seating 10,000–20,000 people. The stage consisted of a dancing floor (orchestra), dressing room and scene-building area (skene). Since the words were the most important part, good acoustics and clear delivery were paramount. The actors (always men) wore masks appropriate to the characters they represented, and each might play several parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/chambdictwh/theatre|title=Credo Reference Library Login Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athenian tragedy—the oldest surviving form of tragedy—is a type of [[dance]]-drama that formed an important part of the theatrical culture of the city-state.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 441), Cartledge (1997, 3–5), Goldhill (1997, 54), Ley (2007, 206), and Styan (2000, 140). Taxidou notes that "most scholars now call 'Greek' tragedy 'Athenian' tragedy, which is historically correct" (2004, 104).&lt;/ref&gt; Having emerged sometime during the 6th century BCE, it flowered during the 5th century BCE (from the end of which it began to spread throughout the Greek world), and continued to be popular until the beginning of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 32–33), Brown (1998, 444), and Cartledge (1997, 3–5). Cartledge writes that although [[Classical Athens|Athenians]] of the 4th century judged [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]] "as the nonpareils of the [[genre]], and regularly honoured their plays with revivals, tragedy itself was not merely a 5th-century phenomenon, the product of a short-lived [[Fifth-century Athens|golden age]]. If not attaining the quality and stature of the fifth-century 'classics', original tragedies nonetheless continued to be written and produced and competed with in large numbers throughout the remaining life of the [[Athenian democracy|democracy]]—and beyond it" (1997, 33).&lt;/ref&gt;

No tragedies from the 6th century BCE and only 32 of the more than a thousand that were performed in during the 5th century BCE have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15) and Kovacs (2005, 379). We have seven by Aeschylus, seven by Sophocles, and eighteen by Euripides. In addition, we also have the ''[[Cyclops (play)|Cyclops]]'', a satyr play by Euripides. Some critics since the 17th century have argued that one of the tragedies that the classical tradition gives as Euripides'—''[[Rhesus (play)|Rhesus]]''—is a 4th-century play by an unknown author; modern scholarship agrees with the classical authorities and ascribes the play to Euripides; see Walton (1997, viii, xix). (This uncertainty accounts for Brockett and Hildy's figure of 31 tragedies.)&lt;/ref&gt; We have complete texts [[Extant literature|extant]] by [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15). The theory that ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' was not written by [[Aeschylus]] adds a fourth, anonymous playwright to those whose work survives.&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of tragedy remain obscure, though by the 5th century BCE it was [[institution]]alised in competitions (''[[agon]]'') held as part of festivities celebrating [[Dionysus]] (the [[Family tree of the Greek gods|god]] of [[wine]] and [[fertility]]).&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13–15) and Brown (1998, 441–447).&lt;/ref&gt; As contestants in the City Dionysia's competition (the most prestigious of the festivals to stage drama) playwrights were required to present a [[tetralogy]] of plays (though the individual works were not necessarily connected by story or theme), which usually consisted of three tragedies and one satyr play.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 442) and Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–17).

Exceptions to this pattern were made, as with [[Euripides]]' ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'' in 438 BCE. There were also separate competitions at the [[Dionysia#City Dionysia|City Dionysia]] for the performance of [[dithyramb]]s and, after 488–7 BCE, [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedies]].&lt;/ref&gt; The performance of tragedies at the City Dionysia may have begun as early as 534 BCE; official records (''didaskaliai'') begin from 501 BCE, when the satyr play was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13, 15) and Brown (1998, 442). Rehm offers the following argument as evidence that tragedy was not institutionalised until 501 BCE: "The specific cult honoured at the [[Dionysia#City Dionysia|City Dionysia]] was that of Dionysus Eleuthereus, the god 'having to do with [[Eleutherae]]', a town on the border between [[Boeotia]] and [[Attica]] that had a sanctuary to Dionysus. At some point [[Classical Athens|Athens]] annexed Eleutherae—most likely after the overthrow of the [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratid]] tyranny in 510 and the democratic reforms of [[Cleisthenes]] in 508–07 BCE—and the cult-image of Dionysus Eleuthereus was moved to its new home. Athenians re-enacted the incorporation of the god's cult every year in a preliminary rite to the City Dionysia. On the day before the festival proper, the cult-statue was removed from the [[Greek temple|temple]] near the [[theatre of Dionysus]] and taken to a temple on the road to Eleutherae. That evening, after [[Animal sacrifice|sacrifice]] and [[hymn]]s, a torchlight procession carried the statue back to the temple, a symbolic re-creation of the god's arrival into Athens, as well as a reminder of the inclusion of the Boeotian town into Attica. As the name Eleutherae is extremely close to eleutheria, 'freedom', Athenians probably felt that the new cult was particularly appropriate for celebrating their own political liberation and democratic reforms." (1992, 15).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Athenian tragedies dramatise events from [[Greek mythology]], though ''[[The Persians]]''—which stages the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] response to news of their military defeat at the [[Battle of Salamis]] in 480 BCE—is the notable exception in the surviving drama.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 442). [[Jean-Pierre Vernant]] argues that in ''[[The Persians]]'' [[Aeschylus]] substitutes for the usual temporal distance between the audience and the [[Greek Heroic Age|age of heroes]] a spatial distance between the Western audience and the Eastern [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian culture]]. This substitution, he suggests, produces a similar effect: "The 'historic' events evoked by the chorus, recounted by the messenger and interpreted by Darius' ghost are presented on stage in a legendary atmosphere. The light that the tragedy sheds upon them is not that in which the political happenings of the day are normally seen; it reaches the Athenian theatre refracted from a distant world of elsewhere, making what is absent seem present and visible on the stage"; Vernant and Vidal-Naquet (1988, 245).&lt;/ref&gt; When Aeschylus won first prize for it at the City Dionysia in 472 BCE, he had been writing tragedies for more than 25 years, yet its tragic treatment of recent history is the earliest example of [[drama]] to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 442) and Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–16).&lt;/ref&gt; More than 130 years later, the philosopher [[Aristotle]] analysed 5th-century Athenian tragedy in the oldest surviving work of [[dramatic theory]]—his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE).

[[Ancient Greek comedy|Athenian comedy]] is conventionally divided into three periods, "Old Comedy", "Middle Comedy", and "New Comedy". Old Comedy survives today largely in the form of the eleven surviving plays of [[Aristophanes]], while Middle Comedy is largely lost (preserved only in relatively short fragments in authors such as [[Athenaeus of Naucratis]]). New Comedy is known primarily from the substantial papyrus fragments of [[Menander]]. Aristotle defined comedy as a representation of laughable people that involves some kind of blunder or ugliness that does not cause pain or disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1449a line 1449a]: "Comedy, as we have said, is a representation of inferior people, not indeed in the full sense of the word bad, but the laughable is a species of the base or ugly. It consists in some blunder or ugliness that does not cause pain or disaster, an obvious example being the comic mask which is ugly and distorted but not painful'."&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the categories of comedy and tragedy at the City Dionysia, the festival also included the [[Satyr play|Satyr Play]]. Finding its origins in rural, agricultural rituals dedicated to Dionysus, the satyr play eventually found its way to Athens in its most well-known form. Satyr's themselves were tied to the god Dionysus as his loyal woodland  companions, often engaging in drunken revelry and mischief at his side. The satyr play itself was classified as tragicomedy, erring on the side of the more modern burlesque traditions of the early twentieth century. The plotlines of the plays were typically concerned with the dealings of the pantheon of Gods and their involvement in human affairs, backed by the chorus of [[Satyrs]]. However, according to Webster, satyr actors did not always perform typical satyr actions and would break from the acting traditions assigned to the character type of a mythical forest creature.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, T.B.L. “Monuments Illustrating Tragedy and Satyr Play (Second Edition with Appendix).” Bulletin Supplement (University of London. Institute of Classical Studies), no. 20, 1967, pp. iii–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman theatre===
{{Main article|Theatre of ancient Rome}}
[[File:Pompeii - Villa del Cicerone - Mosaic - MAN.jpg|thumb|Mosaic depicting masked actors in a play: two women consult a "witch"]]
Western theatre developed and expanded considerably under the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The Roman historian [[Livy]] wrote that the Romans first experienced theatre in the 4th century BCE, with a performance by [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] actors.&lt;ref&gt;Beacham (1996, 2).&lt;/ref&gt; Beacham argues that they had been familiar with "pre-theatrical practices" for some time before that recorded contact.&lt;ref&gt;Beacham (1996, 3).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[theatre of ancient Rome]] was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from [[Roman festival|festival]] performances of [[street theatre]], nude dancing, and [[acrobatics]], to the staging of [[Plautus]]'s broadly appealing situation [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]], to the [[high culture|high-style]], verbally elaborate [[Tragedy|tragedies]] of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the [[Hellenization]] of [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] in the 3rd century BCE had a profound and energizing effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of [[Latin literature]] of the highest quality for the stage. The only surviving Roman tragedies, indeed the only plays of any kind from the Roman Empire, are ten dramas- nine of them pallilara- attributed to Lucuis Annaeus Seneca (4 BCE–65 CE), the Corduba-born Stoic philosopher and tutor of Nero.&lt;ref&gt;John, Gassner, and Allen Ralph.

[[File:Kovalan.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Koothu]] is an ancient form of performing art that originated in early [[Tamilakam]].]]
The earliest-surviving fragments of [[Sanskrit drama]] date from the 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii) and  (1998, 516–517).&lt;/ref&gt; The wealth of archeological evidence from earlier periods offers no indication of the existence of a tradition of theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond516" &gt;Richmond (1998, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient ''[[Vedas]]'' ([[hymn]]s from between 1500 and 1000 BCE that are among the earliest examples of [[History of literature#India|literature]] in the world) contain no hint of it (although a small number are composed in a form of [[dialogue]]) and the [[ritual]]s of the [[Vedic period]] do not appear to have developed into theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond516" /&gt; The ''[[Mahābhāṣya]]'' by [[Patañjali]] contains the earliest reference to what may have been the seeds of Sanskrit drama.&lt;ref name="Richmond517" &gt;Richmond (1998, 517).&lt;/ref&gt; This treatise on [[grammar]] from 140 BCE provides a feasible date for the beginnings of [[theatre in India]].&lt;ref name="Richmond517" /&gt;

The major source of evidence for Sanskrit theatre is ''[[Natyashastra|A Treatise on Theatre]]'' (''Nātyaśāstra''), a compendium whose date of composition is uncertain (estimates range from 200 BCE to 200 CE) and whose authorship is attributed to [[Bharata Muni]]. The ''Treatise'' is the most complete work of dramaturgy in the ancient world. It addresses [[acting]], [[dance]], [[music]], [[Dramaturgy|dramatic construction]], [[Theatre architecture|architecture]], [[Costume design|costuming]], [[Theatrical makeup|make-up]], [[Theatrical properties|props]], the organisation of companies, the audience, competitions, and offers a [[Hindu mythology|mythological]] account of the origin of theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond517" /&gt; In doing so, it provides indications about the nature of actual theatrical practices. Sanskrit theatre was performed on sacred ground by priests who had been trained in the necessary skills (dance, music, and recitation) in a [hereditary process]. Its aim was both to educate and to entertain.

[[File:കൂടിയാട്ടത്തിലെസുഗ്രീവൻ.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Performer playing [[Sugriva]] in the [[Koodiyattam]] form of [[Sanskrit drama|Sanskrit theatre]].]]

Under the patronage of royal courts, performers belonged to professional companies that were directed by a stage manager (''sutradhara''), who may also have acted.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii) and Richmond (1998, 517).&lt;/ref&gt; This task was thought of as being analogous to that of a [[Puppetry|puppeteer]]—the literal meaning of "''sutradhara''" is "holder of the strings or threads".&lt;ref name="Richmond517" /&gt; The performers were trained rigorously in vocal and physical technique.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond (1998, 518).&lt;/ref&gt; There were no prohibitions against female performers; companies were all-male, all-female, and of mixed gender. Certain sentiments were considered inappropriate for men to enact, however, and were thought better suited to women. Some performers played characters their own age, while others played ages different from their own (whether younger or older). Of all the elements of theatre, the ''Treatise'' gives most attention to acting (''abhinaya''), which consists of two styles: realistic (''lokadharmi'') and conventional (''natyadharmi''), though the major focus is on the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond (1998, 518). The literal meaning of ''abhinaya'' is "to carry forwards".&lt;/ref&gt;

Its drama is regarded as the highest achievement of [[Sanskrit literature]].&lt;ref name="Brandonxvii" &gt;Brandon (1981, xvii).&lt;/ref&gt; It utilised [[stock character]]s, such as the hero (''nayaka''), heroine (''nayika''), or clown (''vidusaka''). Actors may have specialised in a particular type. [[Kālidāsa]] in the 1st century BCE, is arguably considered to be ancient [[India]]'s greatest Sanskrit dramatist. Three famous romantic plays written by Kālidāsa are the ''[[Mālavikāgnimitram]]'' (''Mālavikā and Agnimitra''), ''[[Vikramuurvashiiya]]'' (''Pertaining to Vikrama and Urvashi''), and ''[[The Recognition of Sakuntala|Abhijñānaśākuntala]]'' (''The Recognition of Shakuntala''). The last was inspired by a story in the ''Mahabharata'' and is the most famous. It was the first to be translated into [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]]. ''[[Abhijñānaśākuntalam|Śakuntalā]]'' (in English translation) influenced [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe's]] ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' (1808–1832).&lt;ref name="Brandonxvii" /&gt;

The next great Indian dramatist was [[Bhavabhuti]] (c. 7th century CE). He is said to have written the following three plays: ''Malati-Madhava'', ''Mahaviracharita'' and ''Uttar Ramacharita''. Among these three, the last two cover between them the entire epic of ''Ramayana''. The powerful Indian emperor [[Harsha]] (606–648) is credited with having written three plays: the comedy ''[[Ratnavali]]'', ''[[Priyadarsika]]'', and the [[Buddhist]] drama ''[[Nagananda]]''.

===Chinese theatre===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
[[File:Lijiang Yunnan China-Naxi-people-carrying-baskets-01.jpg|thumb|Public performance in Jade Dragon Snow Mountain Open Air Theatre.]]
There are references to theatrical entertainments in China as early as the [[Shang Dynasty]]; they often involved happiness, mimes, and acrobatic displays.The [[Tang Dynasty]] is sometimes known as "The Age of 1000 Entertainments". During this era, Ming Huang formed an acting school known as The [[Pear Garden]] to produce a form of drama that was primarily musical. That is why actors are commonly called "Children of the Pear Garden." During the Dynasty of Empress Ling, [[Shadow play|shadow puppetry]] first emerged as a recognized form of theatre in China. There were two distinct forms of shadow puppetry, Pekingese (northern) and Cantonese (southern). The two styles were differentiated by the method of making the puppets and the positioning of the rods on the [[puppets]], as opposed to the type of [[Play (theatre)|play]] performed by the puppets. Both styles generally performed plays depicting great adventure and fantasy, rarely was this very stylized form of theatre used for political propaganda.

Cantonese shadow puppets were the larger of the two. They were built using thick leather which created more substantial shadows. Symbolic color was also very prevalent; a black face represented honesty, a red one bravery. The rods used to control Cantonese puppets were attached perpendicular to the puppets’ heads. Thus, they were not seen by the audience when the shadow was created. Pekingese puppets were more delicate and smaller. They were created out of thin, translucent leather (usually taken from the belly of a donkey).They were painted with vibrant paints, thus they cast a very colorful shadow. The thin rods which controlled their movements were attached to a leather collar at the neck of the puppet. The rods ran parallel to the bodies of the puppet then turned at a ninety degree angle to connect to the neck. While these rods were visible when the shadow was cast, they laid outside the shadow of the puppet; thus they did not interfere with the appearance of the figure. The rods attached at the necks to facilitate the use of multiple heads with one body. When the heads were not being used, they were stored in a muslin book or fabric lined box. The heads were always removed at night. This was in keeping with the old superstition that if left intact, the puppets would come to life at night. Some puppeteers went so far as to store the heads in one book and the bodies in another, to further reduce the possibility of reanimating puppets. Shadow puppetry is said to have reached its highest point of artistic development in the eleventh century before becoming a tool of the government.

In the [[Song Dynasty]], there were many popular plays involving acrobatics and music. These developed in the [[Yuan Dynasty]] into a more sophisticated form known as ''[[zaju]]'', with a four- or five-act structure. Yuan drama spread across China and diversified into numerous regional forms, one of the best known of which is Beijing Opera,{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} which is still popular today.

[[Xiangsheng]] is a certain traditional Chinese comedic performance in the forms of monologue or dialogue.

===Post-classical theatre in the West===
{{self-published|Section|date=August 2012}}
Theatre took on many alternate forms in the West between the 15th and 19th centuries, including ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' and [[melodrama]]. The general trend was away from the poetic drama of the Greeks and the [[Renaissance]] and toward a more naturalistic prose style of dialogue, especially following the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuritz (1988, 305).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Obviously, this is just a place-holder, as much is missing. --&gt;

Theatre took a big pause during 1642 and 1660 in England because of the [[Puritans|Puritan]] Interregnum. Theatre was seen as something sinful and the Puritans tried very hard to drive it out of their society. This stagnant period ended once Charles II came back to the throne in 1660 in the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]. Theatre (among other arts) exploded, with influence from French culture, since Charles had been exiled in France in the years previous to his reign.

One of the big changes was the new theatre house. Instead of the type of the Elizabethan era, such as the [[Globe Theatre]], round with no place for the actors to really prep for the next act and with no "theatre manners,” the theatre house became transformed into a place of refinement, with a stage in front and stadium seating facing it. Since seating was no longer all the way around the stage, it became prioritized—some seats were obviously better than others. The king would have the best seat in the house: the very middle of the theatre, which got the widest view of the stage as well as the best way to see the point of view and vanishing point that the stage was constructed around. [[Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg]] was one of the most influential set designers of the time because of his use of floor space and scenery.

Because of the turmoil before this time, there was still some controversy about what should and should not be put on the stage. [[Jeremy Collier]], a preacher, was one of the heads in this movement through his piece ''A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage''. The beliefs in this paper were mainly held by non-theatre goers and the remainder of the Puritans and very religious of the time. The main question was if seeing something immoral on stage affects behavior in the lives of those who watch it, a controversy that is still playing out today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Scott R.|title=The English Theatre, 1642–1800|url=http://www.cwu.edu/~robinsos/ppages/resources/Theatre_History/Theahis_10.html|work=Scott R.

[[File:Charles XII High Life below Stairs Mr. Macready 1829.jpg|thumb|Billing for a British theatre in 1829]]

The seventeenth century had also introduced women to the stage, which was considered inappropriate earlier. These women were regarded as celebrities (also a newer concept, thanks to ideas on individualism that arose in the wake of [[Renaissance Humanism]]), but on the other hand, it was still very new and revolutionary that they were on the stage, and some said they were unladylike, and looked down on them. Charles II did not like young men playing the parts of young women, so he asked that women play their own parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's Lives Surrounding Late 18th Century Theatre|url=http://engl3621mgc.tripod.com/|work=English 3621 Writing by Women|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because women were allowed on the stage, playwrights had more leeway with plot twists, like women dressing as men, and having narrow escapes from morally sticky situations as forms of comedy.

Comedies were full of the young and very much in vogue, with the storyline following their love lives: commonly a young roguish hero professing his love to the chaste and free minded heroine near the end of the play, much like [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan's]] ''[[The School for Scandal]]''. Many of the comedies were fashioned after the French tradition, mainly Molière, again hailing back to the French influence brought back by the King and the Royals after their exile. [[Molière]] was one of the top comedic playwrights of the time, revolutionizing the way comedy was written and performed by combining Italian [[commedia dell'arte]] and [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] French comedy to create some of the longest lasting and most influential satiric comedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bermel|first=Albert|title=Moliere – French Dramatist|url=http://www.discoverfrance.net/France/Theatre/Moliere/moliere.shtml|work=Discover France|publisher=Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tragedies were similarly victorious in their sense of righting political power, especially poignant because of the recent Restoration of the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=Joseph|title=The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: Volume 3: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century|year=2010|publisher=Broadview Press|location=Canada|isbn=978-1551116112|pages=533–535|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also imitations of French tragedy, although the French had a larger distinction between comedy and tragedy, whereas the English fudged the lines occasionally and put some comedic parts in their tragedies. Common forms of non-comedic plays were sentimental comedies as well as something that would later be called ''tragédie bourgeoise'', or [[domestic tragedy]]—that is, the tragedy of common life—were more popular in England because they appealed more to English sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matthew|first=Brander|title=The Drama in the 18th Century|url=http://www.imagi-nation.com/moonstruck/clsc20w1.html|work=Moonstruch Drama Bookstore|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While theatre troupes were formerly often travelling, the idea of the national theatre gained support in the 18th century, inspired by [[Ludvig Holberg]]. The major promoter of the idea of the national theatre in Germany, and also of the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' poets, was [[Abel Seyler]], the owner of the [[Hamburgische Entreprise]] and the [[Seyler Theatre Company]].&lt;ref name="abel-seyler"&gt;Wilhelm Kosch, "Seyler, Abel", in ''Dictionary of German Biography'', eds. Walther Killy and Rudolf Vierhaus, Vol. 9, Walter de Gruyter, 2005, {{ISBN|3110966298}}, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the [[Nineteenth-century theatre|19th century]], the popular theatrical forms of [[Romanticism]], [[melodrama]], [[Victorian burlesque]] and the [[well-made play]]s of [[Eugène Scribe|Scribe]] and [[Victorien Sardou|Sardou]] gave way to the [[problem play]]s of [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]] and [[Realism (theatre)|Realism]]; the [[farce]]s of [[Georges Feydeau|Feydeau]]; [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] [[opera]]tic ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]''; [[musical theatre]] (including [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s operas); [[F. C. Burnand]]'s, [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s and [[Oscar Wilde]]'s drawing-room comedies; [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]; proto-[[Expressionism]] in the late works of [[August Strindberg]] and [[Henrik Ibsen]];&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 293–426).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edwardian musical comedy]].

These trends continued through the [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th century]] in the [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] of [[Constantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]] and [[Lee Strasberg]], the political theatre of [[Erwin Piscator]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]], the so-called [[Theatre of the Absurd]] of [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Eugène Ionesco]], American and British musicals, the collective creations of companies of actors and directors such as [[Joan Littlewood]]'s [[Theatre Workshop]], experimental and [[postmodern theatre]] of [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] and [[Robert Lepage]], the [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] theatre of [[August Wilson]] or [[Tomson Highway]], and [[Augusto Boal]]'s [[Theatre of the Oppressed]].

The first form of [[Theatre of India|Indian theatre]] was the [[Sanskrit drama|Sanskrit theatre]].&lt;ref name="Richmond, Swann 1993"&gt;Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 12).&lt;/ref&gt; It began after the development of [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]] and before the development of theatre in other parts of Asia.&lt;ref name="Richmond, Swann 1993"/&gt; It emerged sometime between the 2nd century BCE and the 1st century CE and flourished between the 1st century CE and the 10th, which was a period of relative peace in the [[history of India]] during which hundreds of plays were written.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1997, 70) and Richmond (1998, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese forms of [[Kabuki]], [[Noh|Nō]], and [[Kyōgen]] developed in the 17th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Deal (2007, 276).&lt;/ref&gt; Theatre in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] included [[puppet]] theatre (which included hand puppets, [[shadow play]]s and [[marionette]] productions) and live passion plays known as ''ta'ziya'', where actors re-enact episodes from [[Muslim history]]. In particular, [[Shia Islam]]ic plays revolved around the ''[[Shahid|shaheed]]'' (martyrdom) of [[Ali]]'s sons [[Hasan ibn Ali]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali]]. Secular plays were known as ''akhraja'', recorded in medieval ''[[Adab (behavior)|adab]]'' literature, though they were less common than puppetry and ''ta'ziya'' theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Moreh (1986, 565–601).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Drama===
{{main article|Drama}}
[[Drama]] is the specific [[Mode (literature)|mode]] of [[fiction]] [[Mimesis|represented]] in [[performance]].&lt;ref name="elam98"&gt;Elam (1980, 98).&lt;/ref&gt; The term comes from a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning "[[Action (philosophy)|action]]", which is derived from the verb δράω, ''dráō'', "to do" or "to act". The enactment of drama in theatre, performed by [[actor]]s on a [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] before an [[audience]], presupposes [[Collaboration|collaborative]] modes of production and a [[collective]] form of reception. The [[Dramatic structure|structure of dramatic texts]], unlike other forms of [[literature]], is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception.&lt;ref name="Pfister 1977, 11"&gt;Pfister (1977, 11).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[English Renaissance theatre|early modern]] [[tragedy]] ''[[Hamlet]]'' ([[1601 in literature|1601]]) by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|classical Athenian]] tragedy ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' (c. 429 BCE) by [[Sophocles]] are among the masterpieces of the art of drama.&lt;ref&gt;Fergusson (1949, 2–3).&lt;/ref&gt; A modern example is ''[[Long Day's Journey into Night]]'' by [[Eugene O'Neill]] (1956).&lt;ref&gt;Burt (2008, 30–35).&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered as a genre of [[poetry]] in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the [[Epic poetry|epic]] and the [[Lyric poetry|lyrical]] modes ever since [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE)—the earliest work of [[dramatic theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Fergusson]] writes that "a drama, as distinguished from a [[Lyric poetry|lyric]], is not primarily a composition in the verbal medium; the [[Dialogue (fiction)|words]] result, as one might put it, from the underlying [[Dramatic structure|structure of incident]] and [[Character (arts)|character]]. As [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Aristotle]] remarks, 'the poet, or "maker" should be the maker of [[Plot (narrative)|plots]] rather than of verses; since he is a poet because he [[Mimesis|imiates]], and what he imitates are [[Action (philosophy)|actions]]'" (1949, 8).&lt;/ref&gt; The use of "drama" in the narrow sense to designate a specific ''type'' of [[Play (theatre)|play]] dates from the [[Nineteenth-century theatre|19th century]]. Drama in this sense refers to a play that is ''neither'' a comedy nor a tragedy—for example, [[Émile Zola|Zola's]] ''[[Thérèse Raquin]]'' ([[1873 in literature|1873]]) or [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov's]] ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'' ([[1887 in literature|1887]]). In Ancient Greece however, the word ''drama'' encompassed all theatrical plays, tragic, comic, or anything in between.

Drama is often combined with [[theatre music|music]] and [[dance]]: the drama in [[opera]] is generally sung throughout; [[Musical theatre|musicals]] generally include both spoken [[dialogue]] and [[song]]s; and some forms of drama have [[incidental music]] or musical accompaniment underscoring the dialogue ([[melodrama]] and Japanese [[Noh|Nō]], for example).&lt;ref name="cgt"&gt;See the entries for "opera", "musical theatre, American", "melodrama" and "Nō" in Banham (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In certain periods of history (the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and modern [[Romanticism|Romantic]]) some dramas have been written to be [[Closet drama|read]] rather than performed.&lt;ref name="closet"&gt;While there is some dispute among theatre historians, it is probable that the plays by the Roman [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] were not intended to be performed. ''[[Manfred]]'' by [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]] is a good example of a "[[Verse drama and dramatic verse|dramatic poem]]." See the entries on "Seneca" and "Byron (George George)" in Banham (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Improvisational theatre|improvisation]], the drama does not pre-exist the moment of performance; performers devise a dramatic script spontaneously before an audience.&lt;ref name="impro"&gt;Some forms of improvisation, notably the [[Commedia dell'arte]], improvise on the basis of '[[lazzi]]' or rough outlines of scenic action (see Gordon (1983) and Duchartre (1929)). All forms of improvisation take their cue from their immediate response to one another, their characters' situations (which are sometimes established in advance), and, often, their interaction with the audience. The classic formulations of improvisation in the theatre originated with [[Joan Littlewood]] and [[Keith Johnstone]] in the UK and [[Viola Spolin]] in the US; see Johnstone (1981) and Spolin (1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical theatre===
{{Main article|Musical theatre}}
[[Music]] and theatre have had a close relationship since ancient times—[[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]], for example, was a form of [[dance]]-[[drama]] that employed a [[Greek chorus|chorus]] whose parts were sung (to the accompaniment of an ''[[aulos]]''—an instrument comparable to the modern [[clarinet]]), as were some of the actors' responses and their 'solo songs' ([[Monody|monodies]]).&lt;ref&gt;Rehm (1992, 150n7).&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[musical theatre]] is a form of theatre that also combines music, spoken dialogue, and dance. It emerged from [[comic opera]] (especially [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]), [[Variety show|variety]], [[vaudeville]], and [[music hall]] genres of the late [[Nineteenth-century theatre|19th]] and early [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th century]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones (2003, 4–11).&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Edwardian musical comedy]] that began in the 1890s, the [[Princess Theatre, New York City|Princess Theatre]] musicals of the early 20th century, and comedies in the 1920s and 1930s (such as the works of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]), with ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943), musicals moved in a more dramatic direction.&lt;ref&gt;The first "[[Edwardian musical comedy]]" is usually considered to be ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' (1892), even though it was produced eight years before the beginning of the [[Edwardian era]]; see, for example, Fraser Charlton, [http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/fraser.charlton/edmuscom/page12/edmuscom_what.html "What are EdMusComs?"] (FrasrWeb 2007, accessed May 12, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Famous musicals over the subsequent decades included ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' (1956), ''[[West Side Story]]'' (1957), ''[[The Fantasticks]]'' (1960), ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' (1967), ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' (1975), ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' (1980), ''[[Into the Woods]]'' (1986), and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1986),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first = John| last = Kenrick | title = History of Stage Musicals| url = http://www.musicals101.com/erastage.htm| year = 2003| accessdate = May 26, 2009}}&lt;!-- Looking for a printed source in preference to theatre dept's webpage --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as more contemporary hits including ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' (1994), ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]'' (1997), ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'' (2003), and ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]'' (2015).

Musical theatre may be produced on an intimate scale [[Off-Broadway]], in [[Community theatre|regional theatres]], and elsewhere, but it often includes spectacle. For instance, [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[West End theatre|West End]] musicals often include lavish costumes and sets supported by multimillion-dollar budgets.&lt;!-- Need a source that says B/WE musicals often include these, rather than an example --&gt;

[[File:Roman masks.png|thumb|Theatrical masks of Tragedy and Comedy. Mosaic, [[Roman art]]work, 2nd century CE. [[Capitoline Museums]], [[Rome]], [[Italy]]]]

===Comedy===
{{Main article|Comedy}}

Theatre productions that use [[humour]] as a vehicle to tell a story qualify as comedies. This may include a modern [[farce]] such as ''[[Boeing-Boeing (play)|Boeing Boeing]]'' or a classical play such as ''[[As You Like It]]''. Theatre expressing bleak, controversial or taboo subject matter in a deliberately humorous way is referred to as [[black comedy]]. Black Comedy can have several genres like slapstick humour, dark and sarcastic comedy.

===Tragedy===
{{Main article|Tragedy}}
{{quote|Tragedy, then, is an imitation of an action that is serious, complete, and of a certain magnitude: in language embellished with each kind of artistic ornament, the several kinds being found in separate parts of the play; in the form of action, not of narrative; through pity and fear effecting the proper purgation of these emotions.|[[Aristotle]]|[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]&lt;ref&gt;S.H. Butcher, [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/poetics/], 2011&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aristotle's phrase "several kinds being found in separate parts of the play" is a reference to the structural origins of drama. In it the spoken parts were written in the [[Attic dialect]] whereas the choral (recited or sung) ones in the [[Doric Greek|Doric dialect]], these discrepancies reflecting the differing religious origins and [[Metre (poetry)|poetic metres]] of the parts that were fused into a new entity, the theatrical ''drama''.

[[Tragedy]] refers to a specific [[Poetic tradition|tradition]] of [[drama]] that has played a unique and important role historically in the self-definition of [[Western culture|Western civilisation]].&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 1118) and Williams (1966, 14–16).&lt;/ref&gt; That tradition has been multiple and discontinuous, yet the term has often been used to invoke a powerful effect of [[cultural identity]] and historical continuity—"the [[Classical Athens|Greeks]] and the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethans]], in one cultural form; [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenes]] and [[Christian]]s, in a common activity," as [[Raymond Williams]] puts it.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1966, 16).&lt;/ref&gt; From its obscure origins in the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theatres of Athens]] 2,500 years ago, from which there survives only a fraction of the work of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], through its singular articulations in the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], to the more recent [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] tragedy of [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]], [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett's]] [[Modernism|modernist]] meditations on death, loss and suffering, and [[Heiner Müller|Müller's]] [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] reworkings of the tragic canon, tragedy has remained an important site of cultural experimentation, negotiation, struggle, and change.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1966, 13–84) and Taxidou (2004, 193–209).&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (335 BCE), tragedy has been used to make [[genre]] distinctions, whether at the scale of [[poetry]] in general (where the tragic divides against [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[Lyric poetry|lyric]]) or at the scale of the drama (where tragedy is opposed to [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]]). In the [[Modernity|modern]] era, tragedy has also been defined against drama, [[melodrama]], [[Tragicomedy|the tragicomic]], and [[epic theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;See Carlson (1993), Pfister (1977), Elam (1980) and Taxidou (2004). [[Drama]], in the narrow sense, cuts across the traditional division between comedy and tragedy in an anti- or a-[[Genre|generic]] [[deterritorialization]] from the [[Nineteenth century theatre|mid-19th century]] onwards. Both [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Augusto Boal]] define their [[epic theatre]] projects ([[Non-Aristotelian drama]] and [[Theatre of the Oppressed]] respectively) against models of [[tragedy]]. Taxidou, however, reads epic theatre as an incorporation of tragic functions and its treatments of mourning and speculation (2004, 193–209).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improvisation===
{{Main article|Improvisational theatre}}
Improvisation has been a consistent feature of theatre, with the Commedia dell'arte in the sixteenth century being recognised as the first improvisation form. Popularized by Nobel Prize Winner [[Dario Fo]] and troupes such as the [[Upright Citizens Brigade]] improvisational theatre continues to evolve with many different streams and philosophies. [[Keith Johnstone]] and [[Viola Spolin]] are recognized as the first teachers of improvisation in modern times, with Johnstone exploring improvisation as an alternative to scripted theatre and Spolin and her successors exploring improvisation principally as a tool for developing dramatic work or skills or as a form for situational comedy. Spolin also became interested in how the process of learning improvisation was applicable to the development of human potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=194|title=The Purpose of Playing: Modern Acting Theories in Perspective|first=Robert|last=Gordon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FmAue-VUMmYC&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=Viola%20Spolin%20purpose&amp;pg=PA194#v=onepage&amp;q=Viola%20Spolin%20purpose&amp;f=false|date=2006|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|isbn=978-0472068876}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spolin's son, [[Paul Sills]] popularized improvisational theatre as a theatrical art form when he founded. as its first director, [[the Second City]] in [[Chicago]].

==Theories==
{{Main article|Dramatic theory}}
[[File:Kirmestheater1.JPG|thumb|Village feast with theatre performance circa 1600.]]
Having been an important part of human culture for more than 2,500 years, theatre has evolved a wide range of different [[Dramatic theory|theories]] and practices. Some are related to political or spiritual ideologies, while others are based purely on "artistic" concerns. Some processes focus on a story, some on theatre as event, and some on theatre as catalyst for social change. The [[Ancient Greek philosophy|classical Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]], in his seminal treatise, ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE) is the earliest-surviving example and its arguments have influenced theories of theatre ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Dukore (1974, 31) and Janko (1987, ix).&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he offers an account of what he calls "poetry" (a term which in Greek literally means "making" and in this context includes [[drama]]—[[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], [[tragedy]], and the [[satyr play]]—as well as [[lyric poetry]], [[epic poetry]], and the [[dithyramb]]). He examines its "first principles" and identifies its [[genre]]s and basic elements; his analysis of [[tragedy]] constitutes the core of the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Poetics'' 1447a13 (1987, 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle argues that tragedy consists of six qualitative parts, which are (in order of importance) ''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]'' or "plot", ''[[ethos]]'' or "character", ''[[dianoia]]'' or "thought", ''[[Lexis (Aristotle)|lexis]]'' or "diction", ''[[Melos (Aristotle)|melos]]'' or "song", and ''[[opsis]]'' or "spectacle".&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 19) and Janko (1987, xx, 7–10).&lt;/ref&gt; "Although Aristotle's ''Poetics'' is universally acknowledged in the [[Western culture|Western]] critical tradition", [[Marvin Carlson]] explains, "almost every detail about his seminal work has aroused divergent opinions."&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 16).&lt;/ref&gt; Important [[theatre practitioner]]s of the [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th century]] include [[Konstantin Stanislavski]], [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]], [[Jacques Copeau]], [[Edward Gordon Craig]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Joan Littlewood]], [[Peter Brook]], [[Jerzy Grotowski]], [[Augusto Boal]], [[Eugenio Barba]], [[Dario Fo]], [[Viola Spolin]], [[Keith Johnstone]] and [[Robert Wilson (director)]].

Stanislavski treated the theatre as an [[The arts|art-form]] that is [[Medium specificity|autonomous]] from [[literature]] and one in which the [[playwright]]'s contribution should be respected as that of only one of an ensemble of creative artists.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999a, 124, 202) and (2008b, 6), Carnicke (1998, 162), and Gauss (1999, 2). In 1902, Stanislavski wrote that "the author writes on paper. The actor writes with his body on the stage" and that the "score of an opera is not the opera itself and the script of a play is not drama until both are made flesh and blood on stage"; quoted by Benedetti (1999a, 124).&lt;/ref&gt; His innovative contribution to modern acting theory has remained at the core of mainstream [[Western culture|western]] performance training for much of the last century.&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 1032), Carnicke (1998, 1), Counsell (1996, 24–25), Gordon (2006, 37–40), and Leach (2004, 29).&lt;/ref&gt; That many of the precepts of his [[Stanislavski's system|system of actor training]] seem to be common sense and self-evident testifies to its hegemonic success.&lt;ref name="Counsell 1996, 25"&gt;Counsell (1996, 25).&lt;/ref&gt; Actors frequently employ his basic concepts without knowing they do so.&lt;ref name="Counsell 1996, 25"/&gt; Thanks to its promotion and elaboration by acting teachers who were former students and the many translations of his theoretical writings, Stanislavski's 'system' acquired an unprecedented ability to cross cultural boundaries and developed an international reach, dominating debates about acting in Europe and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 1032), Carnicke (1998, 1, 167), Counsell (1996, 24), and Milling and Ley (2001, 1).&lt;/ref&gt; Many actors routinely equate his 'system' with the North American [[Method acting|Method]], although the latter's exclusively psychological techniques contrast sharply with Stanislavski's multivariant, holistic and [[Psychophysiology|psychophysical]] approach, which explores character and action both from the 'inside out' and the 'outside in' and treats the actor's mind and body as parts of a continuum.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (2005, 147–148) and Carnicke (1998, 1, 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical aspects==
[[File:Vienna - Vienna Opera Backstage - 9729.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A theatre stage building]]
{{Main article|Stagecraft}}
Theatre presupposes [[Collaboration|collaborative]] modes of production and a [[collective]] form of reception. The [[Dramatic structure|structure of dramatic texts]], unlike other forms of [[literature]], is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception.&lt;ref name="Pfister 1977, 11"/&gt; The production of [[Play (theatre)|plays]] usually involves contributions from a [[playwright]], [[theatre director|director]], a [[Cast member|cast]] of [[actor]]s, and a technical [[production team]] that includes a [[set designer|scenic or set designer]], [[lighting designer]], [[costume designer]], [[sound design]]er, [[Stage management|stage manager]], [[production manager]] and technical director. Depending on the production, this team may also include a [[composer]], [[Dramaturge|dramaturg]], [[video design]]er or [[fight director]].

Stagecraft is a generic term referring to the technical aspects of theatrical, film, and video production. It includes, but is not limited to, constructing and rigging scenery, hanging and focusing of lighting, design and procurement of costumes, makeup, procurement of props, stage management, and recording and mixing of sound. Stagecraft is distinct from the wider umbrella term of scenography. Considered a technical rather than an artistic field, it relates primarily to the practical implementation of a designer's artistic vision.

In its most basic form, stagecraft is managed by a single person (often the stage manager of a smaller production) who arranges all scenery, costumes, lighting, and sound, and organizes the cast. At a more professional level, for example in modern Broadway houses, stagecraft is managed by hundreds of skilled carpenters, painters, electricians, stagehands, stitchers, wigmakers, and the like. This modern form of stagecraft is highly technical and specialized: it comprises many sub-disciplines and a vast trove of history and tradition. The majority of stagecraft lies between these two extremes. Regional theatres and larger community theatres will generally have a technical director and a complement of designers, each of whom has a direct hand in their respective designs.

==Sub-categories and organization==
There are many modern theatre movements which go about producing theatre in a variety of ways. Theatrical enterprises vary enormously in sophistication and purpose. People who are involved vary from novices and hobbyists (in community theatre) to professionals (in Broadway and similar productions). Theatre can be performed with a shoestring budget or on a grand scale with multimillion-dollar budgets. This diversity manifests in the abundance of theatre sub-categories, which include:
* [[Broadway theatre]] and [[West End theatre]]
* [[Community theatre]]
* [[Dinner theater]]
* [[Fringe theatre]]
* [[Off-Broadway]] and [[Off West End]]
* [[Off-Off-Broadway]]
* [[Regional theater in the United States|Regional theatre in the United States]]
* [[Summer stock theatre]]

===Repertory companies===
[[File:Cruikshank Pierce' Egan's Real Life - Drury Lane Theatre 1821.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], London, circa 1821]]
While most modern theatre companies rehearse one piece of theatre at a time, perform that piece for a set "run", retire the piece, and begin rehearsing a new show, [[repertory]] companies rehearse multiple shows at one time. These companies are able to perform these various pieces upon request and often perform works for years before retiring them. Most dance companies operate on this repertory system. The [[Royal National Theatre]] in London performs on a repertory system.

Repertory theatre generally involves a group of similarly accomplished actors, and relies more on the reputation of the group than on an individual star actor. It also typically relies less on strict control by a director and less on adherence to theatrical conventions, since actors who have worked together in multiple productions can respond to each other without relying as much on convention or external direction.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson (1982.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Producing vs. presenting===
In order to put on a piece of theatre, both a theatre company and a [[theatre (structure)|theatre venue]] are needed. When a theatre company is the sole company in residence at a theatre venue, this theatre (and its corresponding theatre company) are called a resident theatre or a producing theatre, because the venue produces its own work. Other theatre companies, as well as dance companies, who do not have their own theatre venue, perform at rental theatres or at presenting theatres. Both rental and presenting theatres have no full-time resident companies. They do, however, sometimes have one or more part-time resident companies, in addition to other independent partner companies who arrange to use the space when available. A rental theatre allows the independent companies to seek out the space, while a presenting theatre seeks out the independent companies to support their work by presenting them on their stage.

Some performance groups perform in non-theatrical spaces. Such performances can take place outside or inside, in a non-traditional performance space, and include [[street theatre]], and [[site-specific theatre]]. Non-traditional venues can be used to create more immersive or meaningful environments for audiences. They can sometimes be modified more heavily than traditional theatre venues, or can accommodate different kinds of equipment, lighting and sets.&lt;ref&gt;Alice T. Carter, "[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_575857.html Non-traditional venues can inspire art, or just great performances] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903150133/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_575857.html |date=2010-09-03 }}", ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'', 2008-07-07. Retrieved 2011-02-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[touring theatre|touring company]] is an independent theatre or dance company that travels, often internationally, being presented at a different theatre in each city.

===Unions===
There are many theatre unions including: [[Actors' Equity Association]] (for actors and stage managers), the [[Stage Directors and Choreographers Society]] (SDC), and the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] (IATSE, for designers and technicians). Many theatres require that their staff be members of these organizations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7045">'''Theatre pedagogy''' ({{lang-de|Theaterpädagogik}}) is an independent discipline combining both [[theatre]] and [[pedagogy]]. As a field that arose during the 20th century, theatre pedagogy has developed separately from drama education, the distinction being that the drama teacher typically teaches method, theory and/or practice of performance alone, while theatre pedagogy integrates both art and education to develop language and strengthen social awareness. Theatre pedagogy is rooted in [[drama]] and [[stagecraft]], yet works to educate people outside the realm of theatre itself.

==History==

As a movement, theatre pedagogy has many founders. In Germany, where it is widely recognized and practiced, Hans-Wolfgang Nickel is cited as a pioneer in theatre pedagogy with the founding of the Berlin Stage Teachers in 1959. Nickel later became a professor of theatre games and educational activities at the Berlin [[School of Education]] in 1974.

Another well known German theatre [[pedagogue]] is Hans Martin Ritter who, starting in 1973, ran a series of tests using [[Bertholt Brecht]]'s model of learning through play. Ritter's aim was to develop an interdisciplinary project method for the school using theater as a form of teaching and learning. These tests led Ritter to co-found a nationwide pilot program in merging the fields of theatre and education.

Perhaps theatre pedagogy's most internationally known theorist and practitioner is Brazilian director/facilitator [[Augusto Boal]], who created [[Theatre of the Oppressed]], now practiced by millions of people in more than 70 nations.

==Description==

The primary purpose of theatre pedagogy is to bring about change in understanding the world around us. In achieving this objective, several other skills are taught and learned. These include:

* Developing language, including non-verbal and non-written language.
* Honing drama skills and a theatrical vocabulary.
* Use of collective action to overcome problems in the community.

Theatre pedagogy enhances these forms of communication to facilitate human interaction, helping participants to learn about themselves, their peers, and their surrounding world. Rooted both in traditional education and amateur theater, the field of theatre pedagogy has grown to span many sectors, including:

* Use of drama in the social sphere, such as work in prisons, with people in recovery, as violence prevention, etc.
* Theatrical collaboration between [[Layperson|laypeople]] and [[actor]]s.
* As education, both in ordinary schools and in the theatre.&lt;ref name="CCDC Edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Theatre of the Oppressed in Education|url=http://www.ccdc.in/theatre-oppressed-in-education|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[medical education]] improving communication between faculty and students and between physicians and patients.&lt;ref name="CCDC UCMS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramaswamy|first=Radha|title=UCMS|url=http://www.ccdc.in/theater-oppressed-workshops/feedback/ucms|work=Medical students at University College of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.|publisher=Center for Community Dialogue and Change|accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In job training, integrating [[kinesthetic]] learning to teach [[public speaking]], [[body language]] awareness, motivational training, etc.
* Developing contact between theatre-makers and their audiences.
* Specific theatrical techniques and dramatic forms, such as [[Forum_theatre|Forum Theatre]] and other methods from the [[Theatre of the Oppressed]].

Practitioners of theatre pedagogy operate with a situation-oriented educational framework, usually using the medium of theatre as a vehicle to achieve an objective. Through this method, theatre pedagogy gives access to participants' own ideas and impulses, expanding the avenues of communication and interaction with the self and one's sociocultural environment. Through the use of gesture, intonation, facial expression, and behavior onstage, participants analyze these performative aspects created by the dramatic tension of everyday life. Through these physical and personality-affected models, real-life situations can more clearly express themselves.

==Training==

Theatre pedagogy is taught at universities and colleges, though training in the field is not regulated by state guidelines. In Germany one can receive  a theatre pedagogy degree both at the undergraduate and graduate level, and many German cities have theatre pedagogy centers that provide less formal and unregulated training. Similar to these are the Centers for Theatre of the Oppressed, such as CTO [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]] in [[Brazil]] and the Theatre of the Oppressed Laboratory in [[New York City]] where people can receive theatre pedagogy training using Augusto Boal and [[Paulo Freire]]'s methods.

In the United States, three higher education institutions with strong theatre and drama pedagogy programs are CUNY School of Professional Studies MA in Applied Theatre, New York University Steinhardt's Educational Theatre program, and Emerson College's MA in Theatre Education.

These productions generally feature actors, costumes and sets. The [[History of theatre|history of the theatrical production]] goes back to [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greece]].

Theatrical productions vary in many ways. They can be anything from high school as well as college productions, community theatre productions to summer stock and regional theatre productions all the way to Broadway and Kings Road productions. Today's contemporary theatres produce a variety of plays and musicals that attract very different audiences.

In full theatrical productions there are a great number of people working towards many types of shows. A [[Theatrical producer|producer]] acquires financing, hires staff and oversees everything from the beginning to the end of each show. Theatrical staff is separated by department, which varies from theatre to theatre and production to production depending on needs.

The production will employ front of house and back of house staff. In addition to performers, stage hands, [[stage manager]]s, lighting and [[sound technician]]s, many theatres will hire ushers, concessions workers, janitorial and security in mounting a theatrical production.

Theatrical productions may also involve other types of performance exhibitions, which include improvisational, skit and parody performances which involve varying levels of involvement from off-camera staff or assistants in order to create the production.

'''Tickle Me Elmo''' is a children's [[plush toy]] from Tyco Preschool, a division of [[Tyco Toys]], of the [[The Muppets|Muppet]] character [[Elmo]] from the children's television show, [[Sesame Street]]. When squeezed, Elmo shakes, vibrates, and recites his trademark giggle, "Uh-ha-ha-ha-hee-hee!".

The toy was first produced in the United States in 1996 and slowly became a [[fad|fad toy]]. Some instances of violence were reported over the limited supply amidst heavy consumer demand. ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' reported that the toy which retailed for $28.99 according to its [[MSRP]], had been advertised in newspapers and on the Internet, with sellers asking up to $1,500 by the end of 1997.&lt;ref name=People/&gt;

== Development ==
"Tickles The Chimp", the precursor to Tickle Me Elmo, was invented by Greg Hyman and Ron Dubren, who were known in the toy indusry for having had invented Alphie the Robot (a children's learning computer) several years prior.&lt;ref name="chimp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-12-10/news/9612100178_1_elmo-tickle-sesame-street-character | title=Toy Creator Unwraps Story Of Success | publisher=Chicago Tribune | date=December 10, 1996 | accessdate=30 July 2014 | author=Black, Lisa}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 it was presented to Tyco Preschool as "Tickles The Chimp," which was a toy monkey with a computer chip which laughed when tickled. At the time Tyco didn't have rights to make ''Sesame Street'' plush, but did have ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' plush rights so it was worked on for several months as Tickle Me [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian Devil]], they also made Tickle Me versions of baby [[Bugs Bunny]] and [[Tweety]], they successfully sold it at WB Studio Store in California. They are on Ebay and Amazon too. A short time later, Tyco lost rights to do ''Looney Tunes'' but gained the rights to ''Sesame Street,'' thus starting Tickle Me Elmo.  The invention was originally introduced under [[Cabbage Patch Kids|Cabbage Patch]] at [[Hasbro]] Industries.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Neil Friedman, who was then president of Tyco Preschool, recalled years later that, "When you played with [Tickle Me Elmo] for the first time, it brought a smile to everyone's face. It was a magical surprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenwood|first=Chelsea|year=2009|title=Child's Play: Mattel's Neil Friedman Has Built a Career out of Toying Around—And Making Kids Smile|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-203927063|others={{subscription required|via=[[Questia]]}}|journal=[[Success (magazine)|Success]]|accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1996 Elmo craze==
Tickle Me Elmo was released in July 1996, with a supply of 400,000 units.&lt;!---&lt;ref name="desperate"/&gt;---&gt; The dolls sold well and remained widely available in stores until the  [[Black Friday (shopping)|day after Thanksgiving]], when they suddenly sold out.&lt;!---&lt;ref name="desperate"/&gt;---&gt; With the [[Economics of Christmas|Christmas shopping season]] approaching, Tyco Preschool ordered 600,000 more dolls from their suppliers.&lt;ref name="desperate"&gt;{{cite news|last=Baca|first=Maria Elena|date=10 December 1996|title=Desperate shoppers not laughing at Tickle Me Elmo|newspaper=Star Tribune|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62644967.html|others={{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam]]}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promotion was helped by [[Rosie O'Donnell]], who had shown the toy on [[The Rosie O'Donnell Show|her popular TV show]] in early October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cummins|first=H.

By the end of December, the entire stock of one million "Tickle Me Elmo" toys had been sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|doi=|last=Constable|first=Burt|date=11 December 1997|title=The Aftermath of a Craze: Tickle Me Elmo Revisited|journal=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald ''(Arlington Heights, IL)'']]|volume=|issue=|pages=|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-69036887.html|others={{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam]]}}}} "The company sold its entire supply of 1 million TMEs last year".

==Further Tickle Me toys==
In early 1997, Tyco released new "Tickle Me" toys based on other characters from ''[[Sesame Street]]'' – first ''Tickle Me Ernie'' and ''Tickle Me Big Bird'', then ''Tickle Me Cookie Monster'' – but despite good sales, none of these toys achieved as much fame as Tickle Me Elmo.&lt;ref name="hot toy"/&gt; With the re-release of Tickle Me Elmo, ''Mini Tickle Me Cookie Monster'' and ''Mini Tickle Me Ernie'' were also put on the market.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The "Surprise Edition" of Tickle Me Elmo, issued fall 2001, was an elaborate contest. Five of the "Surprise Edition" Elmos stopped laughing on January 9, 2002, and instead announced to the people squeezing them that they had won a prize. The grand prize was $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dean|first=Katie|date=11 October 2001|title=Elmo's Worth More Than a Tickle|newspaper=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|url=https://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,47368,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TMX===
In 2006 for the tenth anniversary of Tickle Me Elmo, [[Fisher-Price]] released a new Elmo doll called ''TMX'', meaning "Tickle Me (Elmo) Ten" or "Tickle Me eXtreme".  The toy, which was designed by Bruce Lund of Lund and Co. Invention ([[River Forest, Illinois]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jedlowski|first=Jill|date=17 January 2007|title=Toy Story: TMX Elmo Creator Talks Business|newspaper=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)]]|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-157884899.html|others={{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam]]}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; was first announced at the [[American International Toy Fair]]. Rather than simply vibrating like the original, the TMX rolls around on the floor, laughing and smashing his fist on the ground, begging for the tickler to stop.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4x-VW_rCSE "Tickle Me Elmo X TMX Elmo"] (on Youtube).&lt;/ref&gt;

The full look of the doll was not revealed until it debuted live on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Good Morning America]]'' and arrived on store shelves on September 19, 2006. Toy experts said that the delay was unprecedented, with only a few people in the media allowed to preview the product, and only after signing [[confidentiality agreement]]s. The packaging was designed so that the doll could not be seen without purchasing it. The box includes a preview flap, but upon opening, only the doll's eyes are visible. It requires six AA batteries, and costs approximately $40. In a promotional clip, Jim Silver, co-publisher of ''Toy Wishes'' magazine said, "The first reaction I had was, 'Where are the wires?' Because I didn't think anything like that could move on its own.".&lt;ref name="top secret"&gt;{{cite news|last=Barker|first=Olivia|date=1 February 2006|title=Meet 'Top Secret Elmo'|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/2006-02-01-tickle-me-elmo_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Image:Tmx-elmo.jpg|TMX Elmo--&gt;
Toy analyst Chris Byrne told ''[[USA Today]]'', "This is a quantum leap forward, another breakthrough in the preschool plush category." Byrne believed sales would be high, but the reaction would not be as unprecedented. "The culture has moved beyond that, the whole hot-toy phenomenon." He cited the fact there has not been such a craze since [[Furby]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="top secret"/&gt; However, some members of the media expected a large response.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} [[Toys "R" Us]] stores and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] had a pre-sale program for the doll, the first included elaborate in-store displays with a digital countdown to the doll's launch. Amazon took more presale orders than it could fulfill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kotecki Vest|first=Erin|date=22 September 2006|title=Elmo Suckers Me to the Dark Side|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/erin-kotecki-vest/elmo-suckers-me-to-the-da_b_30043.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the original Tickle Me Elmo doll, demand for the new toy gave rise to some extreme acts. One person in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]] was allegedly threatened with a gun to hand over a TMX toy. This was parodied on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', which said the man "was subdued by the new 'Gimmie a Reason [[Bert (Sesame Street)|Bert]]'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tickle pickle: Your Elmo or your life! |date=25 September 2006 |publisher=New York Daily News |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2006/09/25/2006-09-25_tickle_pickle_your_elmo_or_your_life.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930061727/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2006/09/25/2006-09-25_tickle_pickle_your_elmo_or_your_life.html |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TMX and other toys helped Mattel's earnings for the third quarter of the 2006 [[financial year]] to grow by six percent and beat the expectations of [[financial analyst]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|date=16 October 2006|title=Mattel Posts 6 Percent Rise in Profit|newspaper=AP Online|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1Y1-99173190.html|others={{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam]]}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|date=17 October 2006|title=Mattel Tops Expectations|newspaper=[[Cincinnati Post]]|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-152989624.html|others={{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam]]}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; TMX also helped increase sales of other Elmo toys.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

In January 2007, Mattel announced it would release ''TMX Friends'', featuring Elmo, [[Ernie (Sesame Street)|Ernie]] and [[Cookie Monster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kavilanz|first=Parija B.|date=29 January 2007|title=Following T.M.X.

===eXtra Special Edition===
For the Christmas 2007 season, [[Fisher-Price]] released a version with hidden surprises.  [[Mattel]] has provided a website with rhyming clues that can help find the special messages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmxspecialedition.com/ Fisher Price T.M.X. Special Edition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===LOL Elmo===
[[Playskool]] released the toy again as ''LOL Elmo''. Not a single image of the toy was revealed until the American International Toy Fair 2012; in the Hasbro showroom's [[Sesame Street]] section, there is a sign printed "Laughter Unleashed! Fall 2012".  Above it was a video of kids giggling. The toy was released in September. It is also known as Tickle Time Elmo.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
===Tickle Me Elmo (2017)===

[[Playskool]] made a new version of this toy once again but they made it part of their Playskool Friends lineup. Its behavior is like the 1996 version but has more phrases like "Elmo is one ticklish monster". This toy released in August 2017. It can be found at Walmart, Books A Million, Best Buy, Target, Toys R Us before it closed and more. It can still be found

{{Distinguish|Travesti|Travesty (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Bernhardt Hamlet2.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[Sarah Bernhardt]] as [[Hamlet]]]]

'''''Travesti''''' (literally "disguised" in French) is a theatrical term referring to the portrayal of a character in an [[opera]], [[Play (theatre)|play]], or [[ballet]] by a performer of the opposite sex.  Depending on sources, the term may be given as '''travesty''',&lt;ref&gt;*Budden, Julian (1992), 'Travesty' in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', p 799&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anne Hermann|title=Travesty and Transgression: Transvestism in Shakespeare, Brecht, and Churchill|journal=Theatre Journal|year=1989|volume=41|issue=2|pages=133–154|doi=10.2307/3207855|url=http://jstor.org/stable/3207855|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''travesti''''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (2006), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p 899&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*Warrack, John and West, Ewan (1992), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera'', p 716&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''en travesti'''''. The ''Oxford Essential Dictionary of Foreign Terms in English'' explains the origin of the latter term as "pseudo-[[French language|French]]",&lt;ref&gt;According to Speake and LaFlaur (1999), the phrase itself is not recorded in French, and derives from the misinterpretation of ''travesti'' (the [[past participle]] of the French verb ''travestir'') as a noun.&lt;/ref&gt; although French sources from the mid-19th century have used the term, e.g. ''Bibliothèque musicale du Théâtre de l'opéra'' (1876),  ''La revue des deux mondes '' (1868), and have continued the practice into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example Duron (2008) p. 231 and Coste (2004) pp. 26 and 141&lt;/ref&gt;

For social reasons, female roles were played by boys or men in many early forms of theatre, and ''travesti'' roles continued to be used in several types of context even after actresses became accepted on the stage. The popular British theatrical form of the [[pantomime]] traditionally contains a role for a "[[principal boy]]", a [[breeches role]] played by a young woman, and also one or more [[pantomime dame]]s, female comic roles played by men.  Similarly, in the formerly popular genre of [[Victorian burlesque]], there were usually one or more breeches roles.

==Men in female roles==
[[File:Farinelli female caricature edited.jpg|thumb|170 px|left|The famous castrato [[Farinelli]] caricatured in one of his female roles]]
Until the late 17th century in England and the early 19th century in the [[Papal States]]—although not elsewhere in Europe—women were conventionally portrayed by male actors (usually adolescents) in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] because the presence of actual women on stage was considered immoral.

===In theatre===
As a [[boy player]], [[Alexander Cooke]] is thought to have created many of Shakespeare's principal female roles, as well as [[Agrippina the Elder|Agrippina]] in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Sejanus His Fall]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. E. Halliday]], ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564-1964'', Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 114-15.&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of the monarchy]] in 1660, women began to appear on the English stage, although some female roles continued to be played by boys and young men, including romantic leads. [[Edward Kynaston]], whose roles included the title role in Ben Jonson's ''[[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman|Epicoene]]'' and Evadne in [[Francis Beaumont|Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher's]] ''[[The Maid's Tragedy]]'', was one of the last of the era's boy players.&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1992) p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

London's [[Shakespeare's Globe]] theatre, a modern reconstruction of the original [[Globe Theatre]], continues the practice of casting men in female Shakespearean roles. Toby Cockerell played Katherine of France in the theatre's opening production of ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/audience-plays-its-part-in-shakespeares-wooden-o-1254497.html "Audience plays its part in Shakespeare's wooden O"]. ''[[The Independent]]'',  7 June 1997&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Mark Rylance]] played Cleopatra in the 1999 production of ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/264171.stm "Meet Mr Cleopatra"]. [[BBC News]], 27 January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

''Travesti'' roles for men are still to be found in British [[pantomime]], where there is at least one humorous (and usually older) female character traditionally played by a male actor, the [[pantomime dame]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/12/14/btpanto14.xml&amp;sSheet=/arts/2005/12/14/ixartleft.html "Panto's merriest widow"]. ''The Telegraph'', 14 December 2005, accessed 7 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===In opera===
[[Castrato|Castrati]], adult males with a female singing voice (usually produced by castration before puberty), appeared in the earliest operas &amp;ndash; initially in female roles. In the first performance of [[Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo|Orfeo]]'' in 1607 the roles of [[Eurydice]] and [[Proserpina]] were both sung by castrati. However, by 1680 the castrati had become the predominant singers for leading male roles as well. The use of castrati for both male and female roles was particularly strong in the [[Papal States]], where women were forbidden from public stage performances until the 19th century.

An exception to this practice was in 17th and 18th century French opera where it was traditional to use uncastrated male voices both for the hero and for malevolent female divinities and spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Senelick (2000) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]]'s 1686 opera ''[[Armide (Lully)|Armide]]'' the hero (Renaud) was sung by a [[haute-contre]] (a type of high [[tenor]] voice) while the female spirit of hatred (La Haine) was sung by a tenor. In [[Rameau]]'s 1733 ''[[Hippolyte et Aricie]]'', the hero ([[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolyte]]) was sung by an haute-contre, while the roles of the three [[Parcae|Fates]] and [[Tisiphone]] were scored for [[bass (voice type)|basses]] and tenors. The remaining female roles in both operas were sung by women. The title role of the vain but ugly marsh nymph in Rameau's ''[[Platée]]'' is also for an haute-contre.

Female roles in opera sung by men can still be found, although they are not common. The role of the witch in [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Humperdinck]]'s 1890 opera ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'' was originally written for a [[mezzo-soprano]], but was sung by the tenor [[Philip Langridge]] in the [[Metropolitan Opera]]'s 2009 production directed by [[Richard Jones (director)|Richard Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Metropolitan Opera]] (2009). [http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/news/interviews/detail.aspx?id=10678 "Sweet and Low-Down"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Azio Corghi]]'s 2005 opera ''Il dissoluto assolto'', which incorporates story elements from Mozart's ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', casts a [[counter-tenor]] in the role of the [[mannequin]] of Donna Elvira.&lt;ref&gt;Moiraghi, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

===In dance===
The portrayal of women by male dancers was very common in [[Renaissance]] court ballet&lt;ref&gt;Lee (2202) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; and has continued into more modern times, although primarily restricted to comic or malevolent female characters. The use of male dancers for all the female roles in a ballet persisted well into the 18th century in the Papal States, when women dancers had long been taking these roles elsewhere in Italy. Abbé Jérôme Richard who travelled to Rome in 1762 wrote: "Female Dancers are not permitted on the stages in Rome. They substitute for them boys dressed as women and there is also a police ordinance that decreed they wear black bloomers."&lt;ref name = "HW38"&gt;quoted in Harris-Warrick (2005) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Another French traveller that year, Joseph-Thomas, comte d'Espinchal, asked himself: "What impression can one have of ballet in which the prima ballerina is a young man in disguise with artificial feminine curves?"&lt;ref name = "HW38" /&gt;

In the original production of ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' in 1890, a male dancer, [[Enrico Cecchetti]], created the role of the evil fairy Carabosse, although the role has subsequently been danced by both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Brillarelli (1995) p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Frederick Ashton]]'s 1948 choreography of  ''[[Cinderella (Ashton)|Cinderella]]'', [[Robert Helpmann]] and Ashton himself danced the roles of the two stepsisters. [[Ben Stevenson (dancer)|Ben Stevenson]] later continued the practice of casting male dancers as the stepsisters in his own choreography of the ballet.&lt;ref&gt;Upper (2004) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Other female ballet characters traditionally performed by male dancers are Old Madge, the village sorceress in ''[[La Sylphide]]'' and the Widow Simone in ''[[La fille mal gardée]]''.

==Women in male roles==
[[File:Eugénie Fiocre as a matador.jpg|thumb|180 px|The ballerina [[Eugénie Fiocre]] as a [[matador]] circa 1860]]
With the [[English Restoration|Restoration of Charles II]] in 1660 women started appearing on the English stage, both in the female roles that in Shakespeare's day had been portrayed by men and boys, and in male roles. It has been estimated that of the 375 plays produced in London between 1660 and 1700, nearly a quarter contained one or more roles for actresses dressed as men.&lt;ref&gt;See Howe (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the 19th century actresses who made a mark in ''travesti'' roles were [[Mary Anne Keeley]] who portrayed Smike in the stage adaptation of ''[[Nicholas Nickleby]]'' and the robber [[Jack Sheppard]] in [[John Baldwin Buckstone|Buckstone]]'s play based on his life; [[Maude Adams]] who played [[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]] in the American premiere of [[J. M. Barrie|Barrie]]'s play and went on to play the role over 1,500 times;&lt;ref&gt;Harbin, Marra, and Schanke (2005) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sarah Bernhardt]] who created the role of [[Napoleon II of France]] in [[Edmond Rostand]]'s ''[[L'Aiglon]]'', played [[Lorenzino de' Medici]] in [[Alfred de Musset|Musset]]'s ''Lorenzaccio'', Pelléas in [[Maurice Maeterlinck|Maeterlinck]]'s ''[[Pelléas and Mélisande]]'' and perhaps most famously played the title role in ''[[Hamlet]]''. In the [[Victorian era]], [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesques]] generally included several breeches roles.  According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', although "an almost indispensable element of burlesque was the display of attractive women dressed in tights, often in travesty roles ... the plays themselves did not normally tend to indecency."&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich Schwandt|Schwandt, Erich]] et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque",] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the specialists in these roles was [[Nellie Farren]] who created the title roles in numerous burlesques and pantomimes, including ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'', ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' and ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Culme, John. [http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextF/NellieFarren.html Information "Nellie Farren (1848-1904) English burlesque actress"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012233616/http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextF/NellieFarren.html |date=12 October 2009 }} at Footlight Notes, 2003, accessed 8 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In British [[pantomime]], which is still regularly performed, the young male protagonist or [[Principal boy]] is traditionally played by an actress in boy's clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2007) pp. 117 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of women performing ''en travesti'' in operas became increasingly common in the early 19th century as [[castrato]] singers went out of fashion and were replaced by [[mezzo-soprano]]s or [[contralto]]s in the young masculine roles. For example, the title role of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s 1813 ''[[Tancredi]]'' was specifically written for a female singer. However, ''travesti'' mezzo-sopranos had been used earlier by both [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] and [[Mozart]], sometimes because a castrato was not available, or to portray a boy or very young man, such as Cherubino in ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''. In 20th-century opera, composers continued to use women to sing the roles of young men, when they felt the mature tenor voice sounded wrong for the part. One notable example was [[Richard Strauss]], who used a mezzo-soprano for Octavian in ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' and the Composer in ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]''.

From 1830 to 1850, female ballet dancers were increasingly seen in the ''[[corps de ballet]]'' portraying [[matador]]s, [[hussar]]s, and cavaliers, and even as the [[prima ballerina]]'s 'leading man', a practice which was to last well into the 20th century in France.&lt;ref&gt;Garafola (1985) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Although both [[Fanny Elssler]] and her sister Thérèse danced ''travesti'' roles at the Paris Opera, Thérèse, who was very tall by the standards of the day, danced them more frequently, often partnering Fanny as her leading man.&lt;ref&gt;Foster (1998) p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; The French ballerina [[Eugénie Fiocre]], who created the role of Franz in ''[[Coppélia]]'',  was particularly known for her ''travesti'' performances.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1992) p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Victorian burlesque''', sometimes known as '''travesty''' or '''extravaganza''',&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'',  "the various genre terms were always applied freely", and by the 1860s their use had become "arbitrary and capricious": see [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}.  In an 1896 article on Burlesque in ''The Theatre'', the three terms are used interchangeably: see Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt; is a genre of theatrical entertainment that was popular in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England and in the New York theatre of the mid 19th century. It is a form of [[parody music|parody]] in which a well-known opera or piece of classical theatre or ballet is adapted into a broad comic play, usually a musical play, usually risqué in style, mocking the theatrical and musical conventions and styles of the original work, and often quoting or [[pastiche|pastiching]] text or music from the original work. Victorian burlesque is one of several forms of [[burlesque]].

Like [[ballad opera]], burlesques featured musical scores drawing on a wide range of music, from popular contemporary songs to operatic arias, although later burlesques, from the 1880s, sometimes featured original scores.  Dance played an important part, and great attention was paid to the staging, costumes and other spectacular elements of stagecraft, as many of the pieces were staged as [[extravaganza]]s.  Many of the male roles were played by actresses as [[breeches role]]s, purposely to show off their physical charms, and some of the older female roles were taken by male actors.

Originally short, one-act pieces, burlesques were later full-length shows, occupying most or all of an evening's programme. Authors who wrote burlesques included [[J. R. Planché]], [[H. J. Byron]], [[G. R. Sims]], [[F. C. Burnand]], [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Fred Leslie]].

==History==
Burlesque theatre became popular around the beginning of the [[Victorian era]]. The word "burlesque" is derived from the Italian ''burla'', which means "ridicule or mockery".&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', which defines the word as "That species of literary composition, or of dramatic representation, which aims at exciting laughter by caricature of the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects; a literary or dramatic work of this kind."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;Baldick, Chris. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t56.e153 "Burlesque",] ''The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', Oxford University Press, 2008. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', Victorian burlesque was "related to and in part derived from [[pantomime]] and may be considered an extension of the introductory section of pantomime with the addition of gags and 'turns'."&lt;ref name=grove&gt;[[Erich Schwandt|Schwandt, Erich]] et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque",] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another antecedent was [[ballad opera]], in which new words were fitted to existing tunes.&lt;ref&gt;Moss,  Harold Gene. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/830406 "Popular Music and the Ballad Opera",] ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'', Vol. 26, No. 3 (Autumn, 1973), pp. 365–82, University of California Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:1831 Royal Olympic.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Olympic Theatre]], for which Planché wrote ''Olympic Revels'']]
[[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] produced burlesques at the [[Olympic Theatre]] beginning in 1831 with ''Olympic Revels'' by [[J. R. Planché]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. Davenport. ''A Book of Burlesque'' (London: Henry and Co., 1891), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  In these pieces, comedy stemmed from the incongruity and absurdity of the grand classical subjects, with realistic historical dress and settings, being juxtaposed with the everyday modern activities portrayed by the actors. For example, ''Olympic Revels'' opens with the gods of Olympus in classical Greek dress playing [[whist]].&lt;ref&gt;Reinhardt, p. 541&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early burlesques, the words of the songs were written to popular music, as had been done earlier in ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''.  Later in the Victorian era, burlesque mixed [[operetta]], [[music hall]] and [[revue]], and some of the large-scale burlesque spectacles were known as [[extravaganza]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[H. J. Byron]]'s 1863 ''Il trovatore'' parody, which was labelled "a burlesque extravaganza": see Marvin, Roberta Montemorra. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3878318 "Verdian Opera Burlesqued: A Glimpse into Mid-Victorian Theatrical Culture",] ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', Vol. 15, No. 1 (March 2003), p. 42, Cambridge University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The English style of burlesque was successfully launched in New York in the 1840s by the manager and comedian William Mitchell, who had opened his Olympic Theatre in December 1839. Like the London prototypes, his burlesques included characters with nonsensical names such as Wunsuponatyme and The King of Neverminditsnamia, and made fun of all kinds of music currently being presented in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Delmer D. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/779924 "Public Music Performances in New York City from 1800 to 1850",] ''Anuario Interamericano de Investigacion Musical'', Vol. 6 (1970), pp. 5–50, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike pantomime, which aimed at all ages and classes, burlesque was aimed at a narrower, highly literate audience;&lt;ref name=tls/&gt; some writers, such as the Brough brothers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Barnabas Brough]] and his brother [[William Brough (writer)|William Brough]] wrote successful burlesques, sometimes jointly and sometimes alone. Their burlesques include ''The Enchanted Isle'' (1848), ''Medea'' (1856), ''Masaniello'' (1857), ''The Sphinx'' (1849) and ''The Last Edition of Ivanhoe'' (1850). See Dereli, Cynthia. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3577 "Brough, Robert Barnabas (1828–1860)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at a conservative middle class audience, and [[H. J. Byron]]'s success was attributed to his skill in appealing to the lower middle classes.&lt;ref name=tls&gt;Speaight, George. "All froth and bubble", ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 1 October 1976, p. 1233&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most frequent subjects for burlesque were the plays of Shakespeare and grand opera. From the 1850s onwards, burlesquing of Italian, French and, later in the century, German opera was popular with London audiences. [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[La traviata]]'' received their British premieres in 1855 and 1856 respectively; British burlesques of them followed quickly.  ''Our Lady of the Cameleon'' by [[Leicester Silk Buckingham]] and ''Our Traviata'' by William F. Vandervell (both 1857) were followed by five different burlesque treatments of ''Il trovatore'', two of them by H. J. Byron: ''Ill Treated Trovatore, or the Mother the Maiden and the Musicianer'' (1863) and ''Il Trovatore or Larks with a Libretto'' (1880).&lt;ref name=marvin&gt;Marvin,  Roberta Montemorra. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3878318 "Verdian Opera Burlesqued: A Glimpse into Mid-Victorian Theatrical Culture",] ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', Vol. 15, No. 1 (March 2003), pp. 33–66, Cambridge University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operas of [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]], [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]] were burlesqued.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;&lt;ref name=marvin/&gt; In a 2003 study of the subject, Roberta Montemorra Marvin noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
By the 1880s, almost every truly popular opera had become the subject of a burlesque. Generally appearing after an opera's premiere or following a successful revival, they usually enjoyed local production runs, often for a month or longer. The popularity of stage burlesque in general and operatic burlesque in particular seems to have stemmed from the many ways in which it entertained a diverse group, and the manner in which it fed and fed on the circus-like or carnivalesque atmosphere of public Victorian London.&lt;ref name=marvin/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[W. S. Gilbert]] wrote five opera burlesques early in his career, beginning with ''[[Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack]]'' (1866), the most successful of which was ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' (1868).&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1870s, [[Lydia Thompson]]'s burlesque troupe, with [[Willie Edouin]], became famous for their burlesques, by such authors as [[H. B. Farnie]] and [[Robert Reece]], both in Britain and the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, W. J., rev. J. Gilliland. "Thompson, Lydia (1838–1908)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2008 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shakespeare scholar [[Stanley Wells]] notes that although parodies of Shakespeare had appeared even in Shakespeare's lifetime, the heyday of Shakespearean burlesque was the Victorian era.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Stanley. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2867735 "Shakespearian Burlesques",] ''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol. 16, No. 1 (Winter, 1965), pp. 49–61, Folger Shakespeare Library in association with George Washington University, accessed 2 February 2011  {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells observes that the typical Victorian Shakespeare burlesque "takes a Shakespeare play as its point of departure and creates from it a mainly comic entertainment, often in ways that bear no relation to the original play."&lt;ref name=Wells55&gt;Wells, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;  Wells gives, as an example of the puns in the texts, the following: Macbeth and Banquo make their first entrance under an umbrella.  The witches greet them with "Hail! hail! hail!": Macbeth asks Banquo, "What mean these salutations, noble thane?" and is told "These showers of 'Hail' anticipate your 'reign'".&lt;ref name=Wells55/&gt;  Musically, Shakespearean burlesques were as varied as the others of the genre.  An 1859 burlesque of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' contained 23 musical numbers, some from opera, such as the serenade from ''[[Don Pasquale]]'', and some from traditional airs and popular songs of the day including "[[Buffalo Gals]]", and "Nix my Dolly".&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs,  Henry E., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2869557 "The Bard Debunked",] ''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol. 31, No. 2 (Summer, 1980), pp. 294–96, Folger Shakespeare Library in association with George Washington University, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Faustupto.jpg|right|thumb|Sheet music from ''[[Faust up to Date]]'']]
The dialogue for burlesques was generally written in rhyming couplets, or, less often, in other verse forms, such as blank verse; it was notable for its bad [[pun]]s.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;  For example, in ''[[Faust up to Date]]'' (1888), a couplet reads:
:Mephistopheles: "Along the Riviera dudes her praises sing."
:Walerlie: "Oh, did you Riviera such a thing?"&lt;ref&gt;Lubbock, Mark.  [http://www.theatrehistory.com/british/lightopera001.html "History of British musical theatre",] ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'', New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962, pp. 467–68&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Grove'', although "an almost indispensable element of burlesque was the display of attractive women dressed in tights, often in [[Breeches role|travesty roles]] ... the plays themselves did not normally tend to indecency."&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;  Some contemporary critics took a sterner view; in an 1885 article, the critic Thomas Heyward praised Planché ("fanciful and elegant") and Gilbert ("witty, never vulgar"), but wrote of the genre as a whole, "the flashy, 'leggy', burlesque, with its 'slangy' songs, loutish 'breakdowns', vulgar jests, paltry puns and witless grimacing at all that is graceful and poetic is simply odious. … Burlesque, insensate, spiritless and undiscriminating, demoralizes both the audience and the players. It debases the public taste."&lt;ref&gt;Heyward, Thomas, "Burlesque: Its Uses and Abuses", ''Tinsley's Magazine'', November 1885,  p. 477&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert expressed his own views on the worth of burlesque:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The question whether burlesque has a claim to rank as art is, I think, one of degree. Bad burlesque is as far removed from true art as is a bad picture. But burlesque in its higher development calls for high intellectual power on the part of its professors. [[Aristophanes]], [[Rabelais]], [[George Cruikshank|Geo Cruikshank]], the authors of the ''[[Rejected Addresses]]'', [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], Planché were all in their respective lines professors of true burlesque.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, W. S., Letter to Blanche Reives, ''quoted'' in "Modern Burlesque", ''The Orchestra'', November 1880, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his 1859 [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]] burlesque ''Hi-A-Wa-Tha'', the American playwright Charles Walcot encapsulated the character of burlesque in the epilogue, addressed to the audience by [[Mrs. John Wood]] as Minnehaha:
:Ye who love extravaganza,
:Love to laugh at all things funny,
:Love the bold anachronism.
:And the work of paste and scissors,
:And "the unities" destruction,
:Nigger airs, old glees, and catches,
:Interspersed with gems of Op'ra,
:Jokes and puns, good, bad, and so-so, –
:Come and see this mutilation,
:This disgraceful Hiawatha, Mongrel, doggerel Hiawatha!&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Hewitt, Barnard. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3204686  "Mrs. John Wood and the Lost Art of Burlesque Acting",] ''Educational Theatre Journal'', Vol. 13, No. 2 (May, 1961), pp. 82–85, Johns Hopkins University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, ten years later, Gilbert gave an English viewpoint on burlesque, in his epilogue to ''[[The Pretty Druidess]]'':
:So for burlesque I plead. Forgive our rhymes;
:Forgive the jokes you've heard five thousand times;
:Forgive each breakdown, cellar-flap, and clog,&lt;ref&gt;Three types of dance popular in burlesque&lt;/ref&gt;
:Our low-bred songs – our slangy dialogue;
:And, above all – oh, ye with double barrel –
:Forgive the scantiness of our apparel! &lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender reversal and female sexuality==
[[File:The_High_Rollers_Extravaganza_Co._-_Bend_Her_-_c.1900.jpg|thumb|300px|American burlesque on ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben Hur]]'', c. 1900.]]
Actresses in burlesque would often play [[breeches role]]s, which were male roles played by women; likewise, men eventually began to play older female roles.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall, Edith. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30222456 "Classical Mythology in the Victorian Popular Culture"], ''International Journal of the Classic Tradition'', 1999, vol. 5, issue 3, pp. 336–366, accessed 4 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  These reversals allowed viewers to distance themselves from the morality of the play, focusing more on joy and entertainment than catharsis, a definitive shift away from neoclassical ideas.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt;

The depiction of female sexuality in Victorian burlesque was an example of the connection between women as performers and women as sexual objects in Victorian culture.&lt;ref name="Buszek"&gt;Buszek, Maria-Elena.  [http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=394dd17c-6070-4982-a2c4-2e5723826ac7%40sessionmgr104&amp;vid=5&amp;hid=115 "Representing 'Awarishness': Burlesque, Feminist Transgression, and the 19th-Century Pin-up"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The Drama Review'', 1999, vol. 43, issue 4, pp. 141–162, accessed 4 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the history of theatre the participation of women on stage has been questioned.  Victorian culture viewed paid female performance as being closely associated with prostitution, “a profession in which most women in the theatre dabbled, if not took on as a primary source of income.”&lt;ref name=Buszek /&gt;

==Gaiety Theatre==
[[Image:Florence St. John.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Florence St. John]] in ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'']]
Burlesque became the specialty of London's [[Royal Strand Theatre]] and [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] from the 1860s to the early 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Sherson, Erroll, "Lost London Playhouses", ''The Stage'', 28 June 1923, p. 21, one of a series of articles later published in a 1925 book of same name.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s and 1870s, burlesques were often one-act pieces running less than an hour and using [[pastiche]]s and parodies of popular songs, opera [[aria]]s and other music that the audience would readily recognize. [[Nellie Farren]] starred as the Gaiety Theatre's "principal boy" from 1868, and [[John D'Auban]] choreographed the burlesques there from 1868 to 1891.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps". ''The Times'', 17 April 1922, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tm&gt;Biographical file for John D'Auban, list of productions and theatres, [[The Theatre Museum]], London (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward O'Connor Terry]] joined the theatre in 1876. Early Gaiety burlesques included ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' (1868, by Gilbert), ''The Bohemian G-yurl and the Unapproachable Pole'' (1877), ''Blue Beard'' (1882), ''Ariel'' (1883, by [[F. C. Burnand]]) and ''[[Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed]]'' (1883).

Beginning in the 1880s, when comedian-writer [[Fred Leslie]] joined the Gaiety, composers like [[Meyer Lutz]] and [[Osmond Carr]] contributed original music to the burlesques, which were extended to a full-length two- or three-act format.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 February 1914, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; These later Gaiety burlesques starred Farren and Leslie.  They often included Leslie's [[libretti]], written under his pseudonym, "A. C. Torr",&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Maurice. 'The spark that lit the bonfire', in ''Gilbert and Sullivan News'' (London) Spring 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and were usually given an original score by Lutz: ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' (1885), ''[[Monte Cristo Jr.]]'' (1886), ''Pretty Esmeralda'' (1887), ''[[Frankenstein, or The Vampire's Victim]]'' (1887),&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, pp. 14 and 55&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mazeppa'' and ''[[Faust up to Date]]'' (1888).  ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue|Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]'' (1889) made fun of the play ''[[Ruy Blas]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt;  The title was a pun, and the worse the pun, the more Victorian audiences were amused.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Donald J., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3825187 "The Uses of Victorian Laughter",] ''Victorian Studies'', Vol. 10, No. 2 (December 1966), pp. 145–76,  Indiana University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last Gaiety burlesques were ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'' (1890),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/August/prog1detail1.htm |title=Programme for ''Carmen up to Data'' |access-date=10 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210092757/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/August/prog1detail1.htm |archive-date=10 December 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, pp. 254–55&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cinder Ellen up too Late]]'' (1891), and ''Don Juan'' (1892, with lyrics by [[Adrian Ross]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cuttings&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm Arthur Lloyd Music Hall site (on Gaiety) ''Cuttings''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104132022/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm |date=4 January 2008 }} accessed 01 Mar 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1890s, Farren retired, Leslie died, and musical burlesque went out of fashion in London, as the focus of the Gaiety and other burlesque theatres changed to the new genre of [[Edwardian musical comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, Kurt. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/38669 "Edwardes, George Joseph (1855–1915)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, [[Seymour Hicks]] declared that burlesque "is dead as a doornail and will never be revived." From her retirement, Nellie Farren endorsed this judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt;

It involves a series of [[auditions]] in front of a [[Film producer|producer]]/[[Film director|director]].

==Online voice casting==
There has been a shift to online voice over casting in recent years. With many professional voice talent utilizing home studios,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterdrewvo.com/html/home_voiceover_studio.html|title=Home Voiceover Studios-Equipping Yours-Peter Drew Voiceovers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; clients are able to cut out traditional bricks and mortar agents. Websites devoted exclusively to pre-screened professional voice over talent are servicing international clients often faster and cheaper than the traditional casting process of voice talent physically being required to be in a studio.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6727">'''World Wide Telecom Web''' (also called as '''Spoken Web''' or '''Telecom Web''') is an initiative to create an alternate web for the under-privileged. It could help bridge the [[digital divide]] by bringing the benefits of the information revolution to the billions of underserved people by providing information and services through a voice driven channel over an ordinary phone call. Information on this web could be community created as well as leveraged from [[World Wide Web]]. It is essentially a voice driven eco-system parallel and complementary to that of the existing [[World Wide Web|Web]].&lt;ref name="WWTW"&gt;WWTW: The World Wide Telecom Web, In Proceedings of ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Networked Systems for Developing Regions (NSDR), August 2007, Kyoto, Japan.&lt;/ref&gt; Though primarily meant for the under-served in population in emerging economies, it has several applications for the developed world as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_person_subpage.php?id=1649 The World Wide Telecom Web -]&lt;/ref&gt;

WWTW can be accessible to more number of people in the world as it enables an ordinary phone subscriber to join the digital information revolution. This enables a significantly larger fraction of the human population to benefit from existing and envisioned services than what was made possible by WWW. Specifically, it removes accessibility barriers that manifest themselves in terms of illiteracy, unaffordability and lack of relevant information. Further, it provides the means to create and sustain an ecosystem of local (and global) services, information and communities relevant to these underprivileged users.&lt;ref name="WWTW"/&gt;

==How it works==
WWTW is a network of interconnected '''VoiceSites''' (analogous to web sites) that are voice driven applications ''created by'' users themselves and ''hosted'' in the telecom network. VoiceSites can be interconnected using 'VoiLinks' (analogous to hyperlinks) which are links between two voice applications within the web. VoiLinks can span across different enterprises enabling cross-organizational workflows driven by a voice interface over an ordinary phone.

Key enabler technologies include:

1. VoiGen - VoiceSite Creator

2. VoiHost - VoiceSite Hosting Engine

3. [[HSTP]] - Hyperspeech Transfer Protocol

4. WWTW Browser - World Wide Telecom Web Browser

==Brief history==
World Wide Telecom Web was conceived by [http://researcher.ibm.com/view.php?person=in-kkarun Arun Kumar] at [[IBM]] [http://www.research.ibm.com/irl/ India Research Lab] during late 2004 and was later joined by fellow researcher [http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/research_people.nsf/pages/rajput.index.html Nitendra Rajput] in mid-2005. Originally, WWTW was primarily viewed as a novel application of speech technology and [[VoiceXML]] standard even though use of VoiceSites for under-privileged was one of the listed benefits. During the course of a year, they refined the vision and built a couple of primitive prototypes of VoiceSite generator application christened VoiGen, with the help of fellow researcher [http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/research_people.nsf/pages/chakraborty.index.html Dipanjan Chakraborty] and colleague Sandeep Jindal &amp; Rajiv Goyal. In late 2006, inspired by Prof. [[C.K. Prahalad]] and led by Ponani Gopalakrishnan (then the director of IBM India Research Lab), Arun and Nitendra along with Dipanjan and [http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/research_people.nsf/pages/nanavati.index.html Amit Anil Nanavati] got funded for an Exploratory Research project to develop technologies for people towards the Base of the Pyramid. Here, WWTW shot into prominence and got recognized as the most compelling ecosystem for illiterate, low earning population of developing countries such as India. The team reported the work done so far in a [http://domino.research.ibm.com/library/cyberdig.nsf/1e4115aea78b6e7c85256b360066f0d4/9fb1978638a52de5852572890036ddc2?OpenDocument Research Report]. Soon after [http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~sheetal2/ Sheetal K. Agarwal] joined the team. Together this team designed and built the initial technological building blocks of Telecom Web details of which can be found in publications available at [http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/research_people.nsf/pages/arun_kumar.wwtwpubs.html World Wide Telecom Web Publications].
This included creation of technology for enabling voice driven workflows spanning across organizational boundaries. Arun proposed the use of out-of-band-signaling mechanism, followed in telecom networks to achieve this. The resulting Hyperspeech Transfer Protocol (HSTP) got designed and created by the team as an HTTP equivalent protocol that enables voice hyperlinks in VoiceSites. The team designed and built the first prototype of this protocol in mid-2007 and reported it in Hypertext Conference in September 2007. The first successful field trial of VoiceSites as a powerful platform for underprivileged population came in the form of [http://www2008.org/papers/pdf/p1123-agarwal.pdf Voikiosk] system conceived primarily by Nitendra. It is a village portal providing locally relevant content in local language and is available over an ordinary telephone call.
