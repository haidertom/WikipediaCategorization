'''Abstractionism''' is the [[theory]] that the [[mind]] obtains some or all of its [[concept]]s by [[abstraction|abstracting]] them from concepts it already has, or from [[experience]].&lt;ref name="Geach1957"&gt;Geach, Peter (1957) Mental Acts - Their Contents and Their Objects. Routledge Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; One may, for example, abstract 'green' from a set of experiences which involve green along with other [[property (philosophy)|properties]]. Also, for example, one may abstract a generic concept like 'vegetable' from the already possessed concepts of its instances (carrot, broccoli, onion, etc.). This view was criticized by [[George Berkeley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_the_history_of_philosophy/summary/v024/24.4flage.html | title=Berkeley on Abstraction | journal=Journal of the History of Philosophy | year=1986 | volume=24 | issue=4 | pages=483–501 | doi=10.1353/hph.1986.0073 | last=Flage | first=Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Geach]].&lt;ref name="Geach1957"/&gt;

== Development ==
Abstractionism has its roots in [[Aristotle]]'s writings, particularly those rejecting the [[Plato|Platonic]] [[Theory of forms|theory of Forms]]. They were adopted and developed further by the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]] so that the doctrine became entrenched in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Berkeley's Philosophy of Mathematics|last=Jesseph|first=Douglas|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2010|isbn=0226398978|location=Chicago|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]] also developed his own theory of abstract ideas although it was against the Scholastic theory of essences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Causality and Mind: Essays on Early Modern Philosophy|last=Jolley|first=Nicholas|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199669554|location=Oxford|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him, ideas originate through the senses and the materials or the sensory data provided by these become the basis of the way we form general ideas of classes of things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Philosophy of Human Learning|last=Winch|first=Christopher|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=0415161908|location=London|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; His theory contradicts the [[Empiricism|empiricist]] standpoint due to its focus on intuitive and demonstrative knowledge as demonstrated in Locke's recognition that pure mathematics and pure morals are founded on intuition and demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studies in Phenomenology|last=Sinha|first=D|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|year=1969|isbn=9789024702664|location=The Hague|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several modern versions of abstractionism and these include those developed by theorists such as [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Jerry Fodor]], who proposed that concepts are preformed at birth and that we learn to match the words of our language onto the pre-existing concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy of Education: The Key Concepts|last=Gingell|first=John|last2=Winch|first2=Christopher|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=9780415428927|location=New York|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky, for instance, explained the "deep structure" of the [[Internet]] or the grammar of meaning hidden beneath the surface of words by citing that "linguists isolate from an essentially heterogeneous linguistic reality a standard and homogeneous system, thus grounding abstraction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Interlock: Art, Conspiracy, and the Shadow Worlds of Mark Lombardi|last=Goldstone|first=Patricia|publisher=Counterpoint|year=2015|isbn=9781619025653|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Berkeley's opposition to abstractionism is considered to be primarily directed at Locke's claim that words are made general through the mediation of general ideas. This is due to the view that Locke's argument is tantamount to claiming that the word "triangle" can be applied to many different triangles because the abstract general idea of the form is used as a template or standard when identifying new instances as being of the same sort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on the Philosophy of George Berkeley|last=Sosa|first=Ernest|publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Company|year=2012|isbn=9789401086288|location=Dordrecht|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4954">The '''alphabet of human thought''' is a concept originally proposed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] that provides a universal way to represent and analyze ideas and relationships by breaking down their component pieces. All ideas are compounded from a very small number of simple ideas which can be represented by a unique character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|series=International Cognitive Linguistics Conference (1 : 1989 : Duisburg) |editor-last=Geiger |editor-first=Richard A. |editor2-first= Brygida |editor2-last=Rudzka-Ostyn|title=Conceptualizations and mental processing in language|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1993|pages=25–26|isbn=978-3-11-012714-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bunnin|first=Nicholas|author2=Jiyuan Yu|title=The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2004|pages=715|isbn=978-1-4051-0679-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logic and the Universal Language ==
Logic was Leibniz's earliest philosophic interest going back to his teens. [[René Descartes]] had suggested that the [[lexicon]] of a [[universal language]] should consist of primitive elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hatfield|first1=Gary|title=René Descartes, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2014 Edition)|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2014/entries/descartes/|website=plato.stanford.edu|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=12 July 2014|quote=he offered a new vision of the natural world that continues to shape our thought today: a world of matter possessing a few fundamental properties and interacting according to a few universal laws.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The systematic combination of these elements, according to syntactical rules, would generate the infinite combinations of computational structures required to represent human language. In this way Descartes and Leibniz were precursors to computational linguistics as defined by [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam|title=New Horizons in the Study of Language and Mind|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521658225|pages=425–428|edition=Kindle|quote=I mentioned that modern generative grammar has sought to address concerns that animated the tradition; in particular, the Cartesian idea that "the true distinction" (Descartes 1649/1927: 360) between humans and other creatures or machines is the ability to act in the manner they took to be most clearly illustrated in the ordinary use of language: without any finite limits, influenced but not determined by internal state, appropriate to situations but not caused by them, coherent and evoking thoughts that the hearer might have expressed, and so on. The goal of the work I have been discussing is to unearth some of the factors that enter into such normal practice.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 18th century, Leibniz outlined his ''[[characteristica universalis]]'', an artificial language in which [[grammar|grammatical]] and [[logic]]al structure would coincide, which would allow  reasoning to be reduced to calculation. Leibniz acknowledged the work of [[Ramon Llull]], particularly the ''Ars generalis ultima'' (1305), as one of the inspirations for this idea. The basic elements of his ''characteristica'' would be pictographic characters representing unambiguously a limited number of elementary concepts. Leibniz called the inventory of these concepts "the alphabet of human thought." There are quite a few mentions of the ''characteristica'' in Leibniz's writings, but he never set out any details save for a brief outline of some possible sentences in his ''Dissertation on the Art of Combinations''.

His main interest was what is known in modern logic as classification and composition. In modern terminology Leibniz's alphabet was a proposal for an [[automated theorem prover]] or [[Hierarchical classifier|ontology classification reasoner]] written centuries before the technology to implement them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=L.J.|title= The Encyclopedia of Philosophy Volumes 3 and 4|year=1985|publisher=Macmillan Publishing|asin=B0017IMQME|pages=422–423 |editor=Paul Edwards|chapter=Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm|quote=his main emphasis... was on classification, deduction was a natural consequence of combining classified items into new classes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Semantic web implementation ==
[[John Giannandrea]], co-founder and CTO of [[Metaweb|Metaweb Technologies]], acknowledged in a speech that [[Freebase]] was at least linked to the alphabet of human thought, if not an implementation of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PARCForum Presentation by Giannandrea, J.|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa__x-wUKWw|website = YouTube|accessdate = 2015-10-30|at = min 37+}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anna Willess Williams''' (1857 – April 17, 1926) was a teacher and philosophical writer best known as the model for [[George T. Morgan|George T. Morgan's]] silver dollar design, popularly known as the [[Morgan dollar]].

== Morgan dollar ==

[[File:1899 obverse.jpg|thumb|left|150px|1899 Morgan dollar]]

In 1876, George T. Morgan began creating a series of new coin designs at the behest of Director of the Mint, [[Henry Linderman|Dr. Henry R. Linderman]].&lt;ref name="vam"&gt;Van Allen &amp; Mallis, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan opted to use the profile of an American girl to depict [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]] instead of simply creating an imaginary figure for the [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] of his new design.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; After he rejected several possible candidates, Morgan's friend, artist [[Thomas Eakins]], recommended Anna Williams of [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; Eakins knew Williams through her father, Henry Williams, and she had posed for several of Eakins's paintings.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; 

Williams reluctantly sat for five modelling sessions with Morgan in November 1876 after being convinced to do so by friends.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; Morgan was impressed with her profile, stating that it was the most perfect he had seen in England or America.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; The [[Dollar coin (United States)|silver dollar]] bearing her likeness was first struck on March 11, 1878.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; A condition of her sitting for Morgan was that her identity be kept secret, but the subject of the portrait was revealed to be Williams shortly after the dollar was released.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; Williams was troubled by her newly acquired fame, receiving thousands of letters and visits at both her home and workplace.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; Williams preferred not to talk about her modelling work with Morgan, dismissing it as an "incident of my youth."&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;

Despite being offered acting jobs, Williams worked as a teacher until her retirement in 1924.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;''[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,721879,00.html WOMEN: Goddess]'' (April 26, 1926). ''Time''&lt;/ref&gt; She left her job as principal at a girls' house-of-refuge school to become a teacher of [[kindergarten]] philosophy at a girls' [[normal school]].&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; Though she was once engaged to an unknown suitor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The '''belief–desire–intention''' ('''BDI''') model of human practical reasoning was developed by [[Michael Bratman]] as a way of explaining future-directed intention.

BDI is fundamentally reliant on [[folk psychology]] (the 'theory theory'), which is the notion that our mental models of the world are theories. It was used as a basis for developing the [[belief–desire–intention software model]].

BDI was part of the inspiration behind the [[Belief–desire–intention software model|BDI software architecture]], which Bratman was also involved in developing. Here, the notion of intention was seen as a way of limiting time spent on deliberating about what to do, by eliminating choices inconsistent with current intentions.

BDI has also aroused some interest in psychology. BDI formed the basis for a computational model of childlike reasoning [https://web.archive.org/web/20070629002644/http://cognition.iig.uni-freiburg.de/csq/pdf-files/Wahl_Spada.pdf CRIBB]. It has been proposed that autistic children do not recognise other people as folk-psychological agents (i.e., agents with their own beliefs, etc.). BDI has been used to develop a [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/7906/21803/01011803.pdf rehabilitation strategy] to teach autistic children to reason about other people.

'''Bradley's Regress''' is a philosophical problem concerning the nature of [[Relation (philosophy)|relations]].  It is named after [[F. H. Bradley]] who discussed the problem in his 1893 book ''Appearance and Reality''.  It bears a close kinship to the issue of the [[unity of the proposition]].

== Description==

Bradley raises the problem while discussing the [[bundle theory]] of objects, according to which an [[Object (philosophy)|object]] is merely a "bundle" of [[property|properties]].  This theory raises the question of how the various properties that together comprise an object are related when they in fact comprise an object.  More generally, the question that arises is what has to be the case for any two things to be related. Bradley's Regress appears to show that the notion of two things being related generates an [[infinite regress]].  

Suppose, for example, that ''a'' respects ''b''.  This [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] seems to involve three things: ''a'', ''b'', and the relation of respecting.  For the state of affairs of ''a'' respecting ''b'' to obtain, it doesn't, however, suffice that these three things (''a'', ''b'', and the relation of respecting) exist.  They must also be related in some way.  What is required, we might say, is that ''a'' and ''b'' "stand in" the relation of respecting.  But now we seem to have another state of affairs: the state of affairs of ''a'' and ''b'' standing in the relation of respecting.  This state of affairs in turn seems to involve four things: ''a'', ''b'', the relation of respecting, and the relation of standing in.  Again, however, for it to be the case that ''a'' and ''b'' stand in the relation of respecting, it doesn't suffice that these four items exist.  They must also be related in some way.  What is required, we might now say, is that ''a'', ''b'', and the relation of respecting stand in the relation of standing in. And so on, [[ad infinitum]].

== Responses ==

In ''Appearance and Reality'', Bradley seems to conclude that the regress should lead us to abandon the idea that relations are "independently real".  One way to take this suggestion is as recommending that in the case of a respecting b, we are dealing with a state of affairs that has only two constituents: a and b.  It does not, in addition, involve a third item, "the relation of respecting", to which a and b must then bear some further relation ("standing in").

A different option is to accept that the regress is real, but to deny that it is a [[infinite regress|vicious regress]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3020">A '''Cambridge change''' is a philosophical concept of change according to which an [[entity]] ''x'' has changed ''[[if and only if]]'' there is some [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] F that is true (not true) of ''x'' at a time ''t1'' but not true (true) of ''x'' at some later time ''t2''.

==History==
The term ''Cambridge change'' was coined by [[Peter Geach]] in the late 1960s,&lt;ref name="Geach"&gt;Geach, P.T. (1969). ''God and the Soul''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/change/ Change]". ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Retrieved on 2009-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[J. M. E. McTaggart|McTaggart]], philosophers active at [[Cambridge University]].

==Example==
Suppose that at ''t1'', person A is 180&amp;nbsp;cm tall and person B is 175&amp;nbsp;cm tall, while at time ''t2'' A is still 180&amp;nbsp;cm tall but B has grown to be 185&amp;nbsp;cm tall.  Since the predicate 'is taller than B' is true of A at ''t1'' but not true of A at ''t2'', A has changed according to the Cambridge change definition of "change"—he has gone from being taller than B to not being taller than B.

Intuitively, however, it is only person B, and not person A, who has changed: B has grown by 10&amp;nbsp;cm, but A has stayed the same.  This problem with Cambridge changes is usually thought to call for a distinction between [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic]] and [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|extrinsic]], or natural and non-natural, properties.  Given such a distinction, it is possible to define "real" change by requiring that the respective predicates express an intrinsic change in a property, such as a change in height from 175&amp;nbsp;cm to 185&amp;nbsp;cm, rather than an extrinsic change in a property, such as being now taller than B.

But this assumes that there "really" are strictly unary (non-relational) properties that, as such, are thus intrinsic. Namely, a property is intrinsic if and only if it is actually (really, analytically, fundamentally, necessarily, ontologically) unary.

But imagine that all "meter sticks" as of time "t2" have contracted at a rate such that B's height at time "t2" would be measured as having increased by 10&amp;nbsp;cm. Imagine further that A's height has actually (really) shrunk so that it would be measured with a respectively shrinking meter stick as remaining constant from time "t1" to time "t2".

Intuitively, B's height will have remained the same whereas A's height and all ways of measuring height will have changed. In this case, it is A's height and all ways of measuring height that will have changed. The problem with the notion of "Cambridge change" is its failure to acknowledge that B's or anything else's height is relational (relative to ways of measuring height). "Height" is thus not unary and thus is extrinsic, not intrinsic.

Causalism is in accord with how most people have traditionally explained their actions, but critics point out that certain habitual actions such as scratching an itch are only noticed during or after the fact, if at all, making the causalist explanation that such behaviors have a mental antecedent that is not recalled seem ad hoc.

The 20th-century philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]] invokes [[Aristotle]] in her discussions of the problem, writing that "[T]he Aristotelian agent scrutinizes each valuable alternative, seeking out its distinct nature. She is determined to acknowledge the precise sort of value or goodness present in each of competing alternatives, seeing each value, so to speak, as a separate jewel in the crown, valuable in its own right, which does not cease to be separately valuable just because the contingencies of the situation sever it from other goods and it loses out in an overall rational choice.";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The failure of corporate law: fundamental flaws and progressive possibilities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bEKqN8QMONsC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=The+failure+of+corporate+law:+fundamental+flaws+and+progressive+possibilities+competing+goods+nussbaum&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=2006|page=226|ISBN=978-0-226-30693-3|author=Kent Greenfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Aristotle saw that "the values that are constitutive of a good human life are plural and incommensurable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sourcebook on rhetoric: key concepts in contemporary rhetorical studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4C-maGgYk0C&amp;pg=PA465&amp;dq=Competing+goods+nussbaum+aristotle&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=03wSTPeXAcWonAevtvWRAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=|author=James Jasinski|publisher=[[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]|ISBN=978-0-7619-0504-2|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nussbaum has argued that [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] were mistaken when they dismissed conflicts of obligation as illogical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Leading lives that matter: what we should do and who we should be|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqEMy6RbF4sC&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq=%22competing+goods%22+nussbaum&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22competing%20goods%22%20nussbaum&amp;f=false|year=2006|author=Mark R.

Attributed to [[Immanuel Kant]], the '''critical philosophy''' ({{lang-de|kritische Philosophie}}) movement sees the primary task of [[philosophy]] as [[criticism]] rather than justification of knowledge; criticism, for Kant, meant judging as to the possibilities of knowledge before advancing to knowledge itself (from the Greek ''kritike (techne)'', or "art of judgment"). The basic task of philosophers, according to this view, is not to establish and demonstrate theories about reality, but rather to subject all theories—including those about philosophy itself—to critical review, and measure their validity by how well they withstand criticism.

"Critical philosophy" is also used as another name for Kant's philosophy itself. Kant said that philosophy's proper enquiry is not about what is out there in reality, but rather about the character and foundations of experience itself. We must first judge how human reason works, and within what limits, so that we can afterwards correctly apply it to [[empirical evidence|sense experience]] and determine whether it can be applied at all to metaphysical objects.

The question of the '''eternity of the world''' was a concern for both [[Ancient philosophy|ancient philosophers]] and the medieval [[Medieval theology|theologians]] and [[Medieval philosophy|philosophers]] of the 13th century. The question is whether the world has a beginning in time, or whether it has existed from [[eternity]].  The problem became a focus of a dispute in the 13th century, when some of the works of [[Aristotle]], who believed in the eternity of the world, were rediscovered in the [[Latin West]]. This view conflicted with the view of the [[Catholic church]] that the world had a beginning in time.  The Aristotelian view was prohibited in the [[Condemnations of 1210–1277]].

==Aristotle==

The ancient philosopher [[Aristotle]] argued that the world must have existed from eternity in his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' as follows.  In Book I, he argues that everything that comes into [[existence]] does so from a [[Hypokeimenon|substratum]]. Therefore, if the underlying matter of the universe came into existence, it would come into existence from a substratum.  But the nature of matter is precisely to be the substratum from which other things arise.  Consequently, the underlying matter of the universe could have come into existence only from an already existing matter exactly like itself; to assume that the underlying matter of the universe came into existence would require assuming that an underlying matter already existed. As this assumption is self-contradictory, Aristotle argued, matter must be eternal.&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' I, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In Book VIII, his argument from [[Motion (physics)|motion]] is that if an absolute beginning of motion should be assumed, the object to undergo the first motion must either 
:(A) have come into existence and begun to move, or 
:(B) have existed in an eternal state of rest before beginning to move.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle in Physics VIII, 1, 251a, 8-20&lt;/ref&gt;

Option A is self-contradictory because an object cannot move before it comes into existence, and the act of coming into existence is itself a "movement," so that the first movement requires a movement before it, that is, the act of coming into existence. Option B is also unsatisfactory for two reasons.
* First, if the world began at a state of rest, the coming into existence of that state of rest would itself have been motion.
* Second, if the world changed from a state of rest to a state of motion, the cause of that change to motion would itself have been a motion.

He concludes that motion is necessarily eternal.

Aristotle argued that a "[[vacuum]]" (that is, a place where there is no matter) is impossible.  Material objects can come into existence only in place, that is, occupy space.  Were something to come from nothing, "the place to be occupied by what comes into existence would previously have been occupied by a vacuum, inasmuch as no body existed."  But a vacuum is impossible, and matter must be eternal.

The Greek philosopher [[Critolaus]] (c. 200-c. 118 BC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dorandi  |first=Tiziano |chapter=Chapter 2: Chronology |editor-last=Algra |editor-first=Keimpe |display-editors=etal |year=1999 |title=The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy |page=50 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521250283 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Phaselis]] defended Aristotle's doctrine of the eternity of the world, and of the human race in general, against the [[Stoics]].  There is no observed change in the natural order of things; humankind recreates itself in the same manner according to the capacity given by [[Nature]], and the various ills to which it is heir, though fatal to individuals, do not avail to modify the whole. Just as it is absurd to suppose that humans are merely earth-born, so the possibility of their ultimate destruction is inconceivable. The world, as the manifestation of eternal order, must itself be eternal.

==The Neo-Platonists==
The Neoplatonist philosopher [[Proclus]] (412 – 485 AD) advanced in his ''De Aeternitate Mundi'' (On the Eternity of the World) eighteen proofs for the eternity of the world, resting on the divinity of its creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |contributor-last=Lang |contributor-first=Helen  |contribution=Introduction |page=2 |author=Proclus |year=2001 |title=On the Eternity of the World |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn = 0-520-22554-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 529 [[John Philoponus]] wrote his critique ''[[Against Proclus]]'' in which he systematically argued against every proposition put forward for the eternity of the world. The intellectual battle against eternalism became one of Philoponus’ major preoccupations and dominated several of his publications (some now lost) over the following decade.

Philoponus originated the argument now known as the [[Traversal of the infinite]].  If the existence of something requires that something else exist before it, then the first thing cannot come into existence without the thing before it existing. An infinite number cannot actually exist, nor be counted through or 'traversed', or be increased. Something cannot come into existence if this requires an infinite number of other things existing before it.  Therefore the world cannot be infinite.

The Aristotelian commentator [[Simplicius of Cilicia]] and contemporary of Philoponus argued against the Aristotelian view.&lt;ref&gt;Simplicius, ''in Arist. de Caelo'', 6, b, etc., 72; ''in Phys. Ausc.'' 257, 262, etc., 312, etc., 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philoponus' arguments===
Philoponus' arguments for temporal finitism were severalfold.  ''Contra Aristotlem'' has been lost, and is chiefly known through the citations used by [[Simplicius of Cilicia]] in his commentaries on Aristotle's ''Physics'' and ''De Caelo''.  Philoponus' refutation of Aristotle extended to six books, the first five addressing ''De Caelo'' and the sixth addressing ''Physics'', and from comments on Philoponus made by Simplicius can be deduced to have been quite lengthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davidson |first=Herbert A. |date=April–June 1969 |title=John Philoponus as a Source of Medieval Islamic and Jewish Proofs of Creation |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |pages=357–391 |doi=10.2307/596519 |publisher=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=89 |number=2 |jstor=596519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A full exposition of Philoponus' several arguments, as reported by Simplicius, can be found in Sorabji.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sorabji |first=Richard |year=2005  |chapter=Did the Universe have a Beginning? |title=The Philosophy of the Commentators, 200–600 AD |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=0-8014-8988-1 |pages=175–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One such argument was based upon Aristotle's own theorem that there were not multiple infinities, and ran as follows:  If time were infinite, then as the universe continued in existence for another hour, the infinity of its age since creation at the end of that hour must be one hour greater than the infinity of its age since creation at the start of that hour.  But since Aristotle holds that such treatments of infinity are impossible and ridiculous, the world cannot have existed for infinite time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Daniels |first=Mark |date= |title=What's New in Ancient Philosophy |work=Philosopny Now |url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/20/Whats_New_in_Ancient_Philosophy}}{{full|date=March 2016|reason=needs a date as this is a series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philoponus′s works were adopted by many; his first argument against an infinite past being the "argument from the impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite", which states:&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Craig |first=William Lane |date=June 1979 |title=Whitrow and Popper on the Impossibility of an Infinite Past |journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |volume=30 |issue=2  |pages=165–170 [165–166] |doi=10.1093/bjps/30.2.165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"An actual infinite cannot exist."
:"An infinite temporal regress of events is an actual infinite."
:"Thus an infinite temporal regress of events cannot exist."

This argument defines event as equal increments of time. Philoponus argues that the second premise is not controversial since the number of events prior to today would be an actual infinite without beginning if the universe is eternal. The first premise is defended by a reductio ad absurdum where Philoponus shows that actual infinites can not exist in the actual world because they would lead to contradictions albeit being a possible mathematical enterprise. Since an actual infinite in reality would create logical contradictions, it can not exist including the actual infinite set of past events. The second argument, the "argument from the impossibility of completing an actual infinite by successive addition", states:&lt;ref name=Craig/&gt;

:"An actual infinite cannot be completed by successive addition."
:"The temporal series of past events has been completed by successive addition."
:"Thus the temporal series of past events cannot be an actual infinite."

The first statement states, correctly, that a finite (number) cannot be made into an infinite one by the finite addition of more finite numbers. The second skirts around this; the analogous idea in mathematics, that the (infinite) sequence of negative integers "..-3, -2, -1" may be extended by appending zero, then one, and so forth; is perfectly valid.

==Medieval period==
[[Avicenna]] argued that {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} prior to a thing's coming into actual existence, its existence must have been '[[Logical possibility|possible]].'  Were its existence [[necessary truth|necessary]], the thing would already have existed, and were its existence impossible, the thing would never exist.  The possibility of the thing must therefore in some sense have its own existence.  Possibility cannot exist in itself, but must reside within a subject.  If an already existent matter must precede everything coming into existence, clearly nothing, including matter, can come into existence ''[[ex nihilo]]'', that is, from absolute nothingness.  An absolute beginning of the existence of matter is therefore impossible.

The Aristotelian commentator [[Averroes]] supported Aristotle's view, particularly in his work ''[[The Incoherence of the Incoherence]]'' (''Tahafut al-tahafut''), in which he defended [[Aristotelian philosophy]] against [[al-Ghazali]]'s claims in ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'' (''Tahafut al-falasifa'').

Averroes' contemporary [[Maimonides]] challenged Aristotle's assertion that "everything in existence comes from a substratum," on that basis that his reliance on induction and analogy is a fundamentally flawed means of explaining unobserved phenomenon.  According to Maimonides, to argue that "because I have never observed something coming into existence without coming from a substratum it cannot occur" is equivalent to arguing that "because I cannot [[Empiricism|empirically]] observe eternity it does not exist."

Maimonides himself held that neither creation nor Aristotle's infinite time were provable, or at least that no proof was available. (According to scholars of his work, he didn't make a formal distinction between unprovability and the simple absence of proof.) However, some of Maimonides' Jewish successors, including [[Gersonides]] and [[Crescas]], conversely held that the question was decidable, philosophically.&lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feldman |first=Seymour |year=1967 |title=Gersonides' Proofs for the Creation of the Universe |journal=Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research |volume=35 |pages=113–137 |doi=10.2307/3622478 |publisher=Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research |jstor=3622478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, the 'Latin Averroists' were a group of philosophers writing in Paris in the middle of the thirteenth century, who included [[Siger of Brabant]], [[Boethius of Dacia]].  They supported Aristotle's doctrine of the eternity of the world against conservative theologians such as [[John Pecham]] and [[Bonaventure]]. The conservative position is that the world can be logically proved to have begun in time, of which the classic exposition is Bonaventure's argument in the second book of his commentary on [[Sentences|Peter Lombard's sentences]], where he repeats Philoponus' case against a traversal of the infinite.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

[[Aquinas|Thomas Aquinas]], like Maimonides, argued against both the conservative theologians and the Averroists, claiming that neither the eternity nor the finite nature of the world could be proved by logical argument alone. According to Aquinas the possible eternity of the world and its creation would be contradictory if an efficient cause were precede its effect in duration or if non-existence precedes existence in duration. But an efficient cause, such as God, which instantaneously produces its effect would not necessarily precede its effect in duration.  God can also be distinguished from a natural cause which produces its effect by [[Motion (physics)|motion]], for a cause that produces motion must precede its effect. God could be an instantaneous and motionless creator, and could have created the world without preceding it in time. To Aquinas, that the world began was an article of faith.&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. his [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/aquinas-eternity.asp ''De eternitate mundi'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of the Averroists was condemned by [[Stephen Tempier]] in 1277.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

'''Experimentalism''' is the philosophical belief that the way to truth is through [[experiment]]s and [[empiricism]].&lt;ref name="Dictionary1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/experimentalism |title=Experimentalism |work=Your Dictionary |publisher=LoveToKnow Corporation |accessdate=29 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also associated with [[instrumentalism]], the belief that truth should be evaluated based upon its demonstrated usefulness. Deborah Mayo suggests that we should focus on how experimental knowledge is actually arrived at and how it functions in science&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worrall|first=John|last2=Mayo|first2=Deborah G.|last3=Smart|first3=J. J. C.|last4=Barnes|first4=Barry|date=2000-07-01|title=What is this thing called philosophy of science?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02913603|journal=Metascience|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=172–198|doi=10.1007/BF02913603|issn=0815-0796}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Mayo also suggests that the reason New Experimentalists have come up short, is that the part of experiments that have the most to offer in building an account of inference and evidence that are left untapped: designing, generating, modelling and analysing experiments and data.

Less formally, artists often pursue their visions through trial and error; [[experimental arts|this form]] of experimentalism has been practiced in every field, from [[Experimental music|music]] to [[Experimental film|film]] and from [[Experimental literature|literature]] to [[Experimental theatre|theatre]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5959">'''Frege's puzzles''' are puzzles about the [[semantics]] of [[proper name]]s, although related puzzles also arise in the case of [[indexical]]s. [[Gottlob Frege]] (1848–1925) introduced the puzzle at the beginning of his article "Über Sinn und Bedeutung" ("[[On Sense and Reference]]") in 1892 in one of the most influential articles in [[analytic philosophy]] and [[philosophy of language]].

==The puzzles ==

The term "Frege's puzzle" is commonly applied to two related problems.  One is a problem about identity statements that Frege raised at the beginning of "On Sense and Reference", and another concerns propositional attitude reports.&lt;ref&gt;Zalta, Edward N., "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/frege/ Gottlob Frege]", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Fall 2014), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;  For the first problem, consider the following two sentences:

(1) [[Hesperus]] is Hesperus.

(2) Hesperus is [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]].

Each of these sentences is true, since 'Hesperus' refers to the same object as 'Phosphorus' (the planet Venus). Nonetheless, (1) and (2) seem to differ in their meaning or what Frege called "cognitive value". (1) is just a truth of logic that can be known [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]], whereas (2) records an empirical truth that was discovered by astronomers. The problem, however, is that proper names are often taken to have no meaning beyond their reference (a view often associated with [[John Stuart Mill]]). But this seems to imply that the two statements mean the same thing, or have the same cognitive value.&lt;ref&gt;Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2017). Lexemes, practs, and those who have yet to decide. Linguistik Online, 81, 77-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2018). Which view of indirect reports do Persian data corroborate? International Review of Pragmatics, 10(1), 76-100. &lt;/ref&gt;

Frege proposed to resolve this puzzle by postulating a second level of meaning besides reference in the form of what he called [[Sense and reference|sense]]: a difference in the mode of presentation or the way an object can be "given" to us.  Thus 'Hesperus' and 'Phosphorus' have the same reference, but differ in sense because they present Venus in different ways.

The second puzzle concerns [[propositional attitude]] reports, such as belief reports.  Ordinarily, coreferring names are substitutable [[salva veritate]], that is, without change in truth value.  For example, if 'Hesperus is bright' is true then 'Phosphorus is bright' is also true given that 'Hesperus' and 'Phosphorus' refer to the same planet.  But now consider the following argument:

(3) Alex believes Hesperus is visible in the evening.

(4) Hesperus = Phosphorus.

(5) Alex believes Phosphorus is visible in the evening.

This argument appears to be [[Validity (logic)|invalid]]: even if (3) and (4) are true, (5) could be false.  If Alex is not aware that Hesperus and Phosphorus are the same planet, then it seems that he could believe that Hesperus is visible in the evening while rejecting the claim that Phosphorus is visible in the evening (perhaps he thinks Phosphorus, the morning star, is only visible in the morning).  The principle that coreferring names are substitutable ''salva veritate'' thus appears to fail in the context of belief reports (and similarly for other propositional attitude reports).

Frege again proposed to solve this problem by appeal to his distinction between sense and reference.  In particular, he held that when a proper name occurs in the context of an attitude report, its reference shifts to its ordinary sense: thus 'Phosphorus', for example, denotes the planet Venus when it occurs in the sentence 'Phosphorus is visible in the evening' or in an identity sentence like (4), but when it occurs embedded in an attitude report like (5) it denotes its ordinary ''sense.''

==New theories of reference and the return of Frege's puzzle==

Frege's puzzle has received a great deal of attention since the attacks on the [[descriptivist theory of names]] mounted in the 1970s and 1980s by philosophers such as [[Keith Donnellan]], [[Saul Kripke]], [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]], [[Hilary Putnam]], and [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]].&lt;ref&gt;Cumming, S. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/names/ Names]", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the wake of these attacks on descriptivism, many philosophers embraced the Millian or direct-reference view of proper names, according to which the meaning of a name is simply its referent. As noted above, this Millian view has the result that (1) and (2) express the same proposition.  Similarly, the embedded sentences 'Hesperus is visible in the evening' and 'Phosphorus is visible in the evening' from (3) and (5) express the same proposition.  It therefore looks like (3) and (5) cannot differ in truth value since they attribute belief in one and the same proposition.

In view of this problem, many philosophers of language have attempted to work out a solution to the puzzle within the confines of direct-reference theories of proper names. Some of these philosophers include [[Nathan Salmon]] (e.g. in ''Frege's puzzle'' and ''Content, Cognition, and Communication''), [[Howard Wettstein]] (e.g. in "Has Semantics Rested on a Mistake?"), [[Scott Soames]], [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]], [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]] (e.g. in ''Reference and Reflexivity''), and [[Joseph Almog]].

'''Hedone''' was the personification and goddess of pleasure, enjoyment, and delight. Hedone, also known as [[Voluptas]] in Roman mythology, is the daughter of the Greek gods [[Eros]] (Cupid) and [[Psyche (mythology)|Psyche]]. She was associated more specifically with sensual pleasure. Her opposites were the [[Algos]], personifications of pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hedone|url=http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Hedone.html|website=Theoi Greek Mythology|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hēdonē'' ({{lang|grc|ἡδονή}}) is a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning [[pleasure]], and is the root of the English word "[[wikt:hedonism|hedonism]]". In the [[Epicureanism|philosophy]] of [[Epicurus]], hēdonē is described as a pleasure that may or may not derive from actions that are virtuous, whereas another form of pleasure, ''terpsis'', is always virtuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warren|first1=James|title=Epicurus and Democritean ethics : an archaeology of ataraxia|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

==Areas of inquiry==
Henology stands in contradistinction to several other philosophical disciplines. The term "henology" refers to the discipline that centers around The One, as in the philosophies of [[Plato]] and [[Plotinus]]. It is sometimes used in contradistinction to disciplines that treat [[Being]] as its starting point (as in [[Aristotle]] and [[Avicenna]]) and also to those that seek to understand [[Knowledge]] and [[Truth]] (as in [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wyller|first1=Egil A.|title=Henologische Perspektiven II: zu Ehren Egil A.

Nietzsche's critique of the '''historical subject''' is based in the rejection of an existing substance in favor of forces and wills combining to form combinations, sometimes in the form of a [[consciousness]]. [[Heidegger]] later traced the [[concept]] of subject to the metaphysical concept of ''[[ousia]]'' to demonstrate the impossibility of eliminating the subject by simply historicizing it. The modern definition of subjectivity, according to Heidegger, recovered [[Immanuel Kant]]'s definition of the substance in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and [[Aristotle]]'s definition of ''ousia'' in ''[[Metaphysics]]''.

The term "historical subject" is also used by [[Michel Foucault]], as a concept opposed to the eternal and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] subject of the juridical and philosophical [[discourse]], yet still identified as an object. Foucault proposes a [[Philosophy of history#Michel Foucault's analysis of historical and political discourse|"historical and political discourse"]].

The expression '''immaculate perception''' has been used in various senses by various philosophers.

* It is a [[nickname]] for [[Plato]]'s theory of knowledge.  It is called this because Plato believed that all knowledge came from past lives, and from one's knowledge of [[The Forms]].
* It was used by the English philosopher [[Francis Bacon]], who referred to it as the necessity of "keeping the eye steadily fixed upon the facts of nature and so receiving the images simply as they are."&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, Francis. (1620). The Great Instauration.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It was used by the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in his text ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''.  Nietzsche argued that this kind of perception mere fiction, for it ignores the intimate connection between the perceiver and the external world.  In particular, it denies the important role that the will and desires of the perceiver have on every perception.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe, Michael. ''A Dancer’s Virtue: Human Life in Light of Nietzsche’s Eternal Recurrence''. Concept XXVIII, 2005. [http://www.publications.villanova.edu/Concept/2005/Dancer's%20Virtue.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapper 8Ball released a song in March 2012 titled "immaculate perception" featuring Waka Flocka Flame and Yelawolf.

{{For|the Star Trek: Voyager episode|Infinite Regress (Star Trek: Voyager)}}
An '''infinite regress''' in a series of [[proposition]]s arises if the [[truth]] of proposition ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; requires the support of proposition ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the truth of proposition ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; requires the support of proposition ''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and so on, [[ad infinitum]].

Distinction is made between infinite regresses that are "[[vicious circle|vicious]]" and those that are not.

==Aristotle==
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|Aristotle]]
[[Aristotle]] argued that knowing does not necessitate an infinite regress because some knowledge does not depend on demonstration:
{{quote|Some hold that, owing to the necessity of knowing the primary premises, there is no scientific knowledge. Others think there is, but that all truths are demonstrable. Neither doctrine is either true or a necessary deduction from the premises. The first school, assuming that there is no way of knowing other than by demonstration, maintain that an infinite regress is involved, on the ground that if behind the prior stands no primary, we could not know the posterior through the prior (wherein they are right, for one cannot traverse an infinite series): if on the other hand – they say – the series terminates and there are primary premises, yet these are unknowable because incapable of demonstration, which according to them is the only form of knowledge. And since thus one cannot know the primary premises, knowledge of the conclusions which follow from them is not pure scientific knowledge nor properly knowing at all, but rests on the mere supposition that the premises are true. The other party agree with them as regards knowing, holding that it is only possible by demonstration, but they see no difficulty in holding that all truths are demonstrated, on the ground that demonstration may be circular and reciprocal.

Our own doctrine is that not all knowledge is demonstrative: on the contrary, knowledge of the immediate premises is independent of demonstration. (The necessity of this is obvious; for since we must know the prior premises from which the demonstration is drawn, and since the regress must end in immediate truths, those truths must be indemonstrable.) Such, then, is our doctrine, and in addition we maintain that besides scientific knowledge there is its original source which enables us to recognize the definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Patrick Hugh |last=Byrne |year=1997 |title=Analysis &amp; Science in Aristotle |series=SUNY Series in Ancient Greek Philosophy |publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=9780791433218 |lccn=96037783 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=grx6qfb5L7AC&amp;pg=PA83 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1901 |author=Aristotle |title=Posterior Analytics |publisher=B.H.

==Consciousness==
Infinite regress in [[consciousness]] is the formation of an infinite series of "inner observers" as we ask the question of who is observing the output of the [[neural correlates of consciousness]] in the study of [[subjective consciousness]].

==Optics==
[[File:Blond infinite reflections.jpg|thumb|Infinite reflections between two mirrors]]
Infinite regress is akin to the [[optics|optical]] phenomenon wherein an infinite sequence of receding images is formed between two [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] facing [[mirror]]s. A similar process occurs in [[optical feedback]].
{{-}}

==Libertarian free will==
[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|Libertarian free will]] asserts that human actions do not have causes and are chosen [[Consciousness|consciously]] – i.e. are not random. This raises a serious question: what are these conscious decisions based on? Since they can't be based on nothing (as the possibility of decisions being random is excluded), this question can be asked for each subsequent answer or answers to it, thus forming an infinite regress.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070825055350/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/papq.12139/full&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=t0PZ3yjTuX0C&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=libertarianism+infinite+regress&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qla6LiOZCx&amp;sig=nOLQZbiz-rCuY0ROOBrUu0rmTt4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU55LF-5XXAhXCYVAKHQ-LB8kQ6AEITzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=libertarianism%20infinite%20regress&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jindřich Zelený''' (13 November 1922 &amp;ndash; 11 September 1997) (translation: '''Henry Green''') was a [[Czech (people)|Czech]] philosopher and the author of several books.

==Early years==
He was born in [[Bítovany]], [[Czech Republic]] in 1922 and attended school in [[Chrudim]] and [[Hradec Králové]]. In 1948, Zeleny received a Ph.D. in philosophy and sociology from [[Charles University in Prague]].&lt;ref name="Sobotka"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=cs&amp;u=http://www.phil.muni.cz/fil/scf/komplet/zeleny.html&amp;ei=EHgoSp7pJI_EMfS8jIsF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522Jind%25C5%2599ich%2BZelen%25C3%25BD%2522%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26sa%3DN|title=Henry Green|last=Sobotka|first=M.|year=1997|work=Reminiscence on the south-west, FC .|accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Zelený taught at Charles University, VŠPHV, University of Economics, and [[Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences]] (CSAV) FU. In 1981, he was admitted to the CSAV.&lt;ref name="Sobotka" /&gt;

Most of his work is published in the [[Czech language]].  However, ''The logic of Marx'', translated into [[English language]] and edited by [[Terrell Carver]], was published in 1980. ''Die Wissenschaftslogik bei Marx und "Das Kapital"'' was published 1968 in the [[German language]].

==Later years==
Zelený retired from teaching in 1990, and died in [[Prague]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="Sobotka" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7029">'''Krausism''' is a [[doctrine]] named after the German philosopher [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]] (1781–1832) that advocates doctrinal [[toleration|tolerance]] and [[academic freedom]] from [[dogma]].  

This philosophy was widespread in [[Restoration (Spain)|Restoration Spain]], where it reached its maximum practical development thanks to the work of his promotor, [[Julián Sanz del Rio]], and the [[Institución Libre de Enseñanza|Free Institution of Education]] led by [[Francisco Giner de los Ríos]], and the contribution of a great jurist [[Federico Castro]]. 

One of the [[philosophers of identity]], Krause endeavoured to reconcile the ideas of a [[monotheistic]] singular [[God]] understood by [[faith]] with a [[pantheistic]] or [[empirical]] understanding of the world.

[[Divinity]], which is [[Intuition (Mind)|intuitively]] known by [[conscience]] is not a personality (which implies limitations), but an all-inclusive essence (''Wesen''), which contains the [[universe]] within itself. 

This system he called [[panentheism]], a combination of [[monotheism]] and [[pantheism]]. His theory of the world and of humanity is universal and idealistic.

==Spanish Krausism==
Spanish Krausism was a cultural movement that was rooted in the publication in the 19th century of Krause's personal version the dominant idealism, which was largely overshadowed in his native [[Germany]] by the prestige of its leading figures: [[Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and especially [[Hegel]]. 

Around 1840, a group of Spanish [[jurist]]s, notably Julián Sanz del Río were seeking a political doctrine within the [[liberalism|liberal]] tradition to initiate a regenerative process that they felt was necessary to modify and extend the philosophical concepts then in vogue. 

Coincidentally, [[Ruperto Navarro Zamorano]], a member of the Friends of Sanz del Rio, had in 1841 translated the '' Course Natural Law, or Philosophy of Law '', by [[Heinrich Ahrens]], which had previously been published in Paris in 1837.

Ahrens affirmed that the foundation of law is the "compliance": the set of external conditions upon which the fate of the rational [[Homo sapiens| man]] and [[human nature|humanity]] could be developed systematically as a universal order of piety, [[Roman Catholic devotions|devotion]] and [[altruism]]. 

Ahrens philosophy was developed and summarized by Kraus in the formula of "harmonious rationalism" or "[[panentheism]]" published in 1811 as  ''The Ideal of Humanity and Universal Federation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ideal of Humanity and Universal Federation

Clark (Edinburgh)|date=1900|editor=W. Hastie D.D.|accessdate=2014-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin American Krausism==
The common language made some Latin Americans who visited or were exiled to Spain come into contact with Krause's doctrines. The most outstanding case was that of a Puerto Rican [[Eugenio María de Hostos]], who studied philosophy with Sanz del Rio. 

De Hostos' novel ''The Inner Pilgrimage of Eugenio Mara de Hostos as Seen Through Bayón''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Inner Pilgrimage of Eugenio Mara de Hostos as Seen Through Bayón|author=Eugenio Maria de Hostas|publisher=Centro Pro Hostos de Nueva York|date=2006-11-01|editor=de Hildreth N Waltzer}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a romantic novel in the form of a diary outlining his dream of a unified social philosophy. Hostos supports the liberation of women not as a human right, rather as a practical mechanism for greater good for the community and for the social organization. 

The Cuban writer and national hero [[José Martí]],  suffered a brutal political imprisonment with forced labor, but, despite his youth, he escaped prison for exile in Spain.  There he write letters against transatlantic military brutality of the colonial regime. He also studied law and thus encountered the philosophy and doctrines of Krause.

These two proponents,  Martí and de Hostos, although with a very different personal discourses, greatly influenced the evolution of Krausism in which the individual takes personal responsibility to act for the betterment of society. These discourses led to the so-called "Anti-Imperialist-Nationalism". This t term was first developed by Dr. [[Rafael Cuevas]], and referred to the analysis of the rebellion of Augusto C. Sandino, then fighting against the [[United States occupation of Nicaragua]]. 

Hostos and Martí became heroes and allies in their anti-colonial struggle for independence for both [[Spanish–American War|Cuba]] and [[Spanish–American War|Puerto Rico]] from Spain. Both men were initiated into [[Freemasonry]], thus confirming the influence of Freemasonry in the promotion of Krausism and vice versa. These links promoted a kind of social network to support the migration of Krausists liberal educators who reached out to Latin Americas'  liberal leaders who were seeking autonomy from colonial Spain.

Later Krausism figures included [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]], [[José Batlle y Ordóñez]], [[Alfonso Reyes]], [[Jose Enrique Rodo]], [[Alejandro Deustua]], [[Arturo Umberto Illia]] and [[Alejandro Korn]]. Reyes, for example, gave lectures at the [[Residencia de Estudiantes]] in Madrid, whilst Rodo promoted esthetic concern through Krausism in his extensive correspondence with [[Leopoldo Alas]].

The '''liberal paradox''', also '''Sen paradox''' or '''Sen's paradox''', is a logical [[paradox]] discovered by [[Amartya Sen]] which purports to show that no social system can simultaneously
# be committed to a minimal sense of freedom,
# always result in a type of economic efficiency known as [[Pareto efficiency]], and
# be capable of functioning in any society whatsoever.&lt;ref name="SenJPE"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Amartya|last=Sen|title=The Impossibility of a Paretian Liberal|journal=Journal of Political Economy|year=1970|volume=78|pages=152–157|jstor=1829633|doi=10.1086/259614}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SenCCSW"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sen|first=Amartya|title=Collective Choice and Social Welfare|origyear=1970|year=1984|publisher=New Holland|isbn=978-0444851277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SenRF"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sen|first=Amartya|title=Rationality and Freedom|year=2004|publisher= Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674013513}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This paradox is contentious because it appears to contradict the [[classical liberal]] claim that markets are both [[Pareto efficient]] and respect [[Civil liberties|individual freedoms]].

The paradox is similar in many respects to [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] and uses similar mathematical techniques.

==Pareto efficiency==
{{main|Pareto efficiency}}

===Definition===

A particular distribution of goods or outcome of any social process is regarded as ''Pareto efficient'' if there is no way to improve one or more people's situations without harming another. Put another way, an outcome is '''not''' Pareto efficient if there is a way to improve at least one person's situation without harming anyone else.

For example, suppose a mother has ten dollars which she intends to give to her two children Carlos and Shannon. Suppose the children each want only money, and they do not get jealous of one another. The following distributions are Pareto efficient:

{| class="wikitable"
! Carlos 
! Shannon
|-
| $5 
| $5
|-
| $10 
| $0
|-
| $2 
| $8
|}

But a distribution that gives each of them $2 and where the mother wastes the remaining $6 is not Pareto efficient, because she could have given the wasted money to either child and made that child better off without harming the other.

In this example, it was presumed that a child was made better or worse off by gaining or losing money, respectively, and that neither child gained or lost by evaluating her share in comparison to the other.  To be more precise, we must evaluate all possible [[utility|preferences]] that the child might have and consider a situation as Pareto efficient if there is no other social state that at least one person favors (or prefers) and no one disfavors.

===Use in economics===

Pareto efficiency is often used in economics as a minimal sense of [[economic efficiency]].  If a mechanism does not result in Pareto efficient outcomes, it is regarded as inefficient since there was another outcome which could have made some people better off without harming anyone else.

The view that [[Market (economics)|markets]] produce Pareto efficient outcomes is regarded as an important and central justification for [[capitalism]].  This result was established (with certain assumptions) in an area of study known as [[general equilibrium theory]], and is known as [[Fundamental theorems of welfare economics|the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics]]. As a result, these results often feature prominently in [[libertarian]] justifications of unregulated markets.

==Two examples==

=== Sen's original example ===

Sen's original example&lt;ref name="SenJPE" /&gt; used a simple society with only two people and only one social issue to consider.  The two members of society are named "Lewd" and "Prude".  In this society there is a copy of a ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' and it must be given either to Lewd to read, to Prude to read, or disposed of unread.  Suppose that Lewd enjoys this sort of reading and would prefer to read it himself rather than have it disposed of.  However, he would get even more enjoyment out of Prude being forced to read it.

Prude thinks that the book is indecent and that it should be disposed of unread.  However, if someone must read it Prude would prefer that he, himself read it rather than Lewd since Prude thinks it would be even worse for someone to read and enjoy the book rather than read it in disgust.

Given these preferences of the two individuals in the society, a social planner must decide what to do.  Should the planner force Lewd to read the book, force Prude to read the book, or let it go unread?  More particularly, the social planner must rank all three possible outcomes in terms of their social desirability.  The social planner decides that she should be committed to individual rights, each individual should get to choose whether he, himself will read the book. Lewd should get to decide whether the outcome "Lewd reads" will be ranked higher than "No one reads", and similarly Prude should get to decide whether the outcome "Prude reads" will be ranked higher than "No one reads".

Following this strategy, the social planner declares that the outcome "Lewd reads" will be ranked higher than "No one reads" (because of Lewd's preferences) and that "No one reads" will be ranked higher than "Prude reads" (because of Prude's preferences).  Consistency then requires that "Lewd reads" be ranked higher than "Prude reads", and so the social planner gives the book to Lewd to read.

Notice that this outcome is regarded as worse than "Prude reads" by both Prude ''and'' Lewd, and the chosen outcome is therefore [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto inferior]] to another available outcome—the one where Prude is forced to read the book.

=== Gibbard's example ===

Another example was provided by philosopher [[Allan Gibbard]].&lt;ref name="Gibbard"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibbard|first=Allan|title=A Pareto Consistent Libertarian Claim|journal=Journal of Economic Theory|year=1974|volume=7|pages=388–410 |doi=10.1016/0022-0531(74)90111-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppose there are two individuals Alice and Bob who live next door to each other.  Alice loves the color blue and hates red.  Bob loves the color green and hates yellow.  If each were free to choose the color of their house independently of the other, they would choose their favorite colors.  But Alice hates Bob with a passion, and she would gladly endure a red house if it meant that Bob would have to endure his house being yellow.  Bob similarly hates Alice, and would gladly endure a yellow house if that meant that Alice would live in a red house.

If each individual is free to choose their own house color, independently of the other, Alice would choose a blue house and Bob would choose a green one.  But, this outcome is not Pareto efficient, because both Alice and Bob would prefer the outcome where Alice's house is red and Bob's is yellow.  As a result, giving each individual the freedom to choose their own house color has led to an inefficient outcome—one that is inferior to another outcome where neither is free to choose their own color.

Mathematically, we can represent Alice's preferences with this symbol: &lt;math&gt;\succ_A&lt;/math&gt; and Bob's preferences with this one: &lt;math&gt;\succ_B&lt;/math&gt;.  We can represent each outcome as a pair: (''Color of Alice's house'', ''Color of Bob's house'').  As stated Alice's preferences are:

:(Blue, Yellow) &lt;math&gt;\succ_A&lt;/math&gt; (Red, Yellow) &lt;math&gt;\succ_A&lt;/math&gt; (Blue, Green) &lt;math&gt;\succ_A&lt;/math&gt; (Red, Green)

And Bob's are:

:(Red, Green) &lt;math&gt;\succ_B&lt;/math&gt; (Red, Yellow) &lt;math&gt;\succ_B&lt;/math&gt; (Blue, Green) &lt;math&gt;\succ_B&lt;/math&gt; (Blue, Yellow)

If we allow free and independent choices of both parties we end up with the outcome (Blue, Green) which is dispreferred by both parties to the outcome (Red, Yellow) and is therefore not Pareto efficient.

==The theorem==
Suppose there is a society ''N'' consisting of two or more individuals and a set ''X'' of two or more social outcomes. (For example, in the Alice and Bob case, ''N'' consisted of Alice and Bob, and ''X'' consisted of the four color options ⟨Blue, Yellow⟩, ⟨Blue, Green⟩, ⟨Red, Yellow⟩, and ⟨Red, Green⟩.)

Suppose each individual in the society has a [[Total relation|total]] and [[transitive relation|transitive]] preference relation on the set of social outcomes ''X''. For notation, the preference relation of an individual ''i''∊''N'' is denoted by ≼&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Each preference relation belongs to the set ''Rel(X)'' of all total and transitive relations on ''X''.

A social choice function is a map which can take any configuration of preference relations of ''N'' as input and produce a subset of ("chosen") social outcomes as output. Formally, a social choice function is a map

&lt;math&gt;F : {Rel}(X)^N \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--all possible combinations of preference relations for members of ''N''!--&gt;

from the set of functions between ''N''→''Rel(X)'', to the power set of ''X''. (Intuitively, the social choice function represents a societal principle for choosing one or more social outcomes based on individuals' preferences. By representing the social choice process as a ''function'' on ''Rel(X)''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;, we are tacitly assuming that the social choice function is defined for any possible configuration of preference relations; this is sometimes called the Universal Domain assumption.)


The liberal paradox states that every social choice function satisfies ''at most one'' of the following properties, never both:

# '''Pareto optimality''': whenever all individuals of a society strictly prefer an outcome ''x'' over an outcome ''y'', the choice function doesn't pick ''y''. 
#* Formally, a social choice function ''F'' is Pareto optimal if whenever ''p''∊''Rel(X)''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; is a configuration of preference relations and there are two outcomes ''x'' and ''y'' such that  ''x''⪲&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''y'' for every individual ''i''∊''N'', then ''y''∉ ''F(p)''.
# '''Minimal liberalism''': More than one individual in the society is '''decisive''' on a pair of social outcomes. (An individual is decisive on a pair of social outcomes ''x'' and ''y'' if, whenever he prefers ''x'' over ''y'', the social choice function prefers ''x'' over ''y'' regardless of what other members of the society prefer. And similarly whenever he prefers ''y'' over ''x'', the social choice function prefers ''y'' over ''x''.)
#* Formally, a social choice function ''F'' respects minimal liberalism if there is more than one individual ''i''∊''N'' for which there exists a pair of outcomes ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; on which he is decisive—that is, for every configuration of preference relations  ''p''∊''Rel(X)''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;∊ ''F(p)'' only when ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;≼&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; (and similarly, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;∊ ''F(p)'' only when ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;≼&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;).
#* As an example of decisiveness: in the Lewd/Prude case, Lewd was decisive on the pair of outcomes ⟨"Lewd reads", "No one reads"⟩ and Prude was decisive on the pair of outcomes ⟨"Prude reads", "No one reads"⟩.

In other words, the liberal paradox states that for every social choice function ''F'', there is a configuration of preference relations ''p''∊''Rel(X)''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; for which ''F'' violates either Pareto optimality or Minimal liberalism (or both). In the examples of Sen and Gibbard noted above, the social choice function satisfies minimal liberalism at the expense of Pareto optimality.

==Ways out of the paradox==

Because the paradox relies on very few conditions, there are a limited number of ways to escape the paradox.  Essentially one must either reject the ''universal domain'' assumption, the ''Pareto principle'', or the ''minimal liberalism principle.''  Sen himself suggested two ways out, one a rejection of universal domain another a rejection of the Pareto principle.

=== Universal domain ===

Julian Blau proves that Sen's paradox can only arise when individuals have "nosy" preferences—that is when their preference depends not only on their own action but also on others' actions.&lt;ref name="Blau"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blau|first=Julian|title=Liberal Values and Independence|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|year=1975|volume=42|number=3|pages=395–401 |doi=10.2307/2296852 |jstor=2296852}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the example of Alice and Bob above, Alice has a preference over how Bob paints his house, and Bob has a preference over Alice's house color as well.

Most arguments which demonstrate market efficiency assume that individuals care about only their own consumption and not others' consumption and therefore do not consider the situations that give rise to Sen's paradox.  In fact, this shows a strong relationship between Sen's paradox and the well known result that [[Market failure|markets fail]] to produce Pareto outcomes in the presence of [[externalities]].&lt;ref name= "Laffont"&gt;[[Jean-Jacques Laffont|Laffont, J. J.]] (2008). "externalities," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Ed. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000200&amp;q=externality&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=9 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt; Externalities arise when the choices of one party affect another.  Classic examples of externalities include [[pollution]] or [[over fishing]]. Because of their nosy preferences, Alice's choice imposes a negative externality on Bob and vice versa.

To prevent the paradox, Sen suggests that "The ultimate guarantee for individual liberty may rest not on rules for social choice but on developing individual values that respect each other's personal choices."&lt;ref name="SenJPE" /&gt; Doing so would amount to limiting certain types of nosy preferences, or alternatively restricting the application of the Pareto principle only to those situations where individuals fail to have nosy preferences.

Note that if we consider the case of cardinal preferences—for instance, if Alice and Bob both had to state, within certain bounds, how much happiness they would get for each color of each house separately, and the situation which produced the most happiness were chosen—a minimally-liberal solution does not require that they have no nosiness at all, but just that the sum of all "nosy" preferences about one house's color are below some threshold, while the "non-nosy" preferences are all above that threshold. Since there are generally some questions for which this will be true—Sen's classic example is an individual's choice of whether to sleep on their back or their side—the goal of combining minimal liberalism with Pareto efficiency, while impossible to guarantee in all theoretical cases, may not in practice be impossible to obtain.

=== Pareto ===

Alternatively, one could remain committed to the universality of the rules for social choice and to individual rights and instead reject the universal application of the Pareto principle.  Sen also hints that this should be how one escapes the paradox: 
{{quote|What is the moral?  It is that in a very basic sense liberal values conflict with the Pareto principle. If someone takes the Pareto principle seriously, as economists seem to do, then he has to face problems of consistency in cherishing liberal values, even very mild ones.  Or, to look at it in another way, if someone does have certain liberal values, then he may have to eschew his adherence to Pareto optimality. While the Pareto criterion has been thought to be an expression of individual liberty, it appears that in choices involving more than two alternatives it can have consequences that are, in fact, deeply illiberal.&lt;ref name="SenJPE" /&gt;}}

=== Minimal liberalism ===

Most commentators on Sen's paradox have argued that Sen's minimal liberalism condition does not adequately capture the notion of individual rights.&lt;ref name="Gibbard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nozick"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nozick|first=Robert|year=1974|title=Anarchy, State, and Utopia|publisher=Basic books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardenfors"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gärdenfors|first=Peter|year=1981|title=Rights, games and social choice|journal=Nous|volume=15|number=3|pages=341–356 |jstor=2215437|doi=10.2307/2215437 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sugden"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sugden|first=Robert|year=1985|title=Why be consistent? A critical analysis of consistency requirements in choice theory|journal=Economica|volume=52|number=206|pages=167–183 |jstor=2554418|doi=10.2307/2554418 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially what is excluded from Sen's characterization of individual rights is the ability to voluntarily form contracts that lay down one's claim to a right.

For example, in the example of Lewd and Prude, although each has a right to refuse to read the book, Prude would voluntarily sign a contract with Lewd promising to read the book on condition that Lewd refrain from doing so.  In such a circumstance there was no violation of Prude's or Lewd's rights because each entered the contract willingly.  Similarly, Alice and Bob might sign a contract to each paint their houses their dispreferred color on condition that the other does the same.

In this vein, Gibbard provides a weaker version of the minimal liberalism claim which he argues is consistent with the possibility of contracts and which is also consistent with the Pareto principle given any possible preferences of the individuals.&lt;ref name="Gibbard" /&gt;

=== Dynamism ===

Alternatively, instead of both Lewd and Prude deciding what to do at the same time, they should do it one after the other. If Prude decides not to read, then Lewd will decide to read, same outcome. However, if Prude decides to read, Lewd won't. "Prude reads" is preferred by Prude (and also Lewd) than "Lewd reads", so he will decide to read (with no obligation, voluntarily) to get this Pareto Efficient outcome. Marc Masat hints that this should be another way out of the paradox: 

{{quote|If there's, at least, one player without dominant strategy, the game will be played sequentially where players with dominant strategy and need to change it (if they are in the Pareto optimal they don't have to) will be the firsts to choose, allowing to reach the Pareto Efficiency without dictatorship nor restricted domain and also avoiding contract's costs such as time, money or other people. If all players present a dominant strategy, contracts may be used.&lt;ref name="Masat"&gt;{{cite paper|last=Masat|first=Marc|year=2014|title=Did you save room for dessert?

==Overview==
Linguistic film theory was proposed by [[Stanley Cavell]]&lt;ref name=Dualist/&gt; and it is based on the philosophical tradition begun by [[late Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. The theory itself is said to mirror aspects of the activity of Wittgenstein's own philosophising (e.g. Wittgenstein's thought experiments) as films are viewed capable of engaging the audience in a therapeutic process of 'dialogue' and even investigate the [[Absurdity|absurd]] and the limits of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Film as Philosophy: Essays in Cinema after Wittgenstein and Cavell|last=Read|first=Rupert|last2=Goodenough|first2=Jerry|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2005|isbn=9781403997951|location=New York|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavell's framework is seen as a distinctive way of approaching film and [[philosophy]] since question of style - the finding of words adequate to our aesthetic experience - is central to the understanding of the meaning of films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Daniel|date=2017|title=Stanley Cavell on the Magic of the Movies|url=https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/full/10.3366/film.2017.0034|journal=Film-Philosophy|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=114–132|doi=10.3366/film.2017.0034|issn=1466-4615|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his ideas involved the position that "if one thinks of a grammar as a machine for generating sentences, then perhaps one will wish to speak of the camera and its film as a machine for generating idioms."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Viewed: Reflections on the Ontology of Film|last=Cavell|first=Stanley|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1979|isbn=067496196X|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Utilitarianism |expanded=Problems}}

The '''mere addition paradox''', also known as the '''repugnant conclusion''', is a problem in [[ethics]], identified by [[Derek Parfit]] and discussed in his book ''[[Reasons and Persons]]'' (1984). The paradox identifies the mutual incompatibility of four intuitively compelling assertions about the relative value of populations.

==The paradox==

Consider the four populations depicted in the following diagram: A, A+, B− and B. Each bar represents a distinct group of people, with the group's size represented by the bar's width and the [[happiness]] of each of the group's members represented by the bar's height. Unlike A and B, A+ and B− are complex populations, each comprising two distinct groups of people.

[[Image:MereAddition.svg|center]]

How do these populations compare in value? 

Parfit observes that i) A+ seems no worse than A. This is because the people in A are no worse-off in A+, while the additional people who exist in A+ are better off in A+ compared to A (if it is stipulated that their lives are good enough that living them is better than not existing).

Next, Parfit suggests that ii) B− seems better than A+. This is because B− has greater total and average happiness than A+.

Then, he notes that iii) B seems equally as good as B−, as the only difference between B− and B is that the two groups in B− are merged to form one group in B.

Together, these three comparisons entail that B is better than A. However, Parfit observes that when we directly compare A (a population with high average happiness) and B (a population with lower average happiness, but more total happiness because of its larger population), it may seem that B can be worse than A.

Thus, there is a paradox. The following intuitively plausible claims are jointly incompatible: (a) that A+ is no worse than A, (b) that B− is better than A+, (c) that B− is equally as good as B, and (d) that B can be worse than A.

==Criticisms and responses==
Some scholars, such as [[Larry Temkin]] and Stuart Rachels, argue that the apparent inconsistency between the four claims just outlined relies on the assumption that the "better than" relation is [[Transitive relation|transitive]]. We may resolve the inconsistency, thus, by rejecting the assumption. On this view, from the fact that A+ is no worse than A and that B− is better than A+ it simply does not follow that B− is better than A.

[[Torbjörn Tännsjö]] argues that the intuition that B is worse than A is wrong. While the lives of those in B are worse than those in A, there are more of them and thus the collective value of B is greater than A.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torbjorn|first=Tannsjo|date=January 2009|title=Why We Ought to Accept the Repugnant Conclusion|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/utilitas/article/why-we-ought-to-accept-the-repugnant-conclusion/F60DB3A1B9CA4460650EA5DF9AA0540D|journal=Utilitas|volume=14|pages=|doi=10.1017/S0953820800003642|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Huemer]] also argues that the repugnant conclusion is not repugnant and that normal intuition is wrong.&lt;ref name="huemer"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/heathwood/6100/Huemer%20-%20Defence%20of%20Repugnance.pdf| title=In Defence of Repugnance| first=Michael| last=Huemer| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109034025/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/heathwood/6100/Huemer%20-%20Defence%20of%20Repugnance.pdf| archivedate=2016-01-09| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the above discussion fails to appreciate the true source of repugnance. On the face of it, it may not be absurd to think that B is better than A. Suppose, then, that B is in fact better than A, as Huemer argues. It follows that this revised intuition must hold in subsequent iterations of the original steps. For example, the next iteration would add even more people to B+, and then take the average of the total happiness, resulting in C-. If these steps are repeated over and over, the eventual result will be Z, a massive population with the minimum level of average happiness; this would be a population in which every member is leading a life barely worth living. Z is the repugnant conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reasons and Persons|last=Parfit|first=Derek|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1984|isbn=019824908X|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative usage==
An alternative use of the term ''mere addition paradox'' was presented in a paper by Hassoun in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/working-papers/2010/en_GB/wp2010-120/ |title=Another Mere Addition Paradox? Some Reflections on Variable Population Poverty Measurement |publisher=UNU-WIDER |date=November 2010 |accessdate=31 March 2015 |isbn=978-92-9230-358-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It identifies paradoxical reasoning that occurs when certain statistical measures are used to calculate results over a population. For example, if a group of 100 people together control $100 worth of resources, the average wealth per capita is $1. If a single rich person then arrives with 1 million dollars, then the total group of 101 people controls $1,000,100, making average wealth per capita $9,901, implying a drastic shift away from poverty even though nothing has changed for the original 100 people. Hassoun defines a ''no mere addition axiom'' to be used for judging such statistical measures: "merely adding a rich person to a population should not decrease poverty" (although acknowledging that in actual practice adding rich people to a population may provide some benefit to the whole population).

This same argument can be generalized to many cases where proportional statistics are used: for example, a game sold on a download service may be considered a failure if less than 20% of those who download the demo then purchase the game. Thus, if 10,000 people download the demo of a game and 2,000 buy it, the game is a borderline success; however, it would be rendered a failure by an extra 500 people downloading the demo and not buying, even though this "mere addition" changes nothing with regard to income or consumer satisfaction from the previous situation.

The '''Modern Greek Enlightenment''' ({{lang-el|Διαφωτισμός}}, ''Diafotismos'', "enlightenment," "illumination") was the Greek expression of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

==Origins==
{{further information|Ottoman Greece}}
The Greek Enlightenment was given impetus by the Greek predominance in trade and education in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Greek [[merchant]]s financed a large number of young Greeks to study in universities in [[Renaissance Italy|Italy]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire|German states]]. There they were introduced to the ideas of the Enlightenment and the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=BritannicaA&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Greek history, Intellectual Revival'', 2008 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the wealth of the extensive [[Greeks|Greek]] merchant class that provided the material basis for the intellectual revival that was the prominent feature of Greek life in the half century and more leading to 1821.  It was not by chance that on the eve of the [[Greek War of Independence]] the most important centres of Greek learning, schools-cum-universities, were situated in [[Ioannina]], [[Chios]], [[Smyrna]] (Izmir) and [[Ayvalik]], all major centres of Greek commerce.&lt;ref name=BritannicaB&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Greek history, The mercantile middle class'', 2008 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of the Phanariotes===
The [[Phanariotes]] were a small caste of Greek families who took their collective name from the [[Phanar]] quarter of [[Constantinople]] where the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]] is still housed. They held various administrative posts within the [[Ottoman Empire]], the most important of which were those of [[hospodar]], or prince, of the [[Danubian principalities]] of [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]]. Most hospodars acted as patrons of Greek culture, education, and printing. These academies attracted teachers and pupils from throughout the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] commonwealth, and there was some contact with intellectual trends in [[Habsburg]] central Europe. For the most part they supported the Ottoman system of government, too much to play a significant part in the emergence of the Greek national movement; however, their support of learning produced many highly educated Greek scholars who benefited from the cosmopolitan environment the Phanariotes cultivated in their principalities.&lt;ref name=BritannicaC&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Greek history, Transformation toward emancipation, The Phanariotes'', 2008 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

This environment was in general a special attraction for young, ambitious and educated Greek people from the Ottoman Empire, contributing to their national enlightenment. The Princely Academies of [[Princely Academy of Bucharest|Bucharest]] and [[Princely Academy of Iaşi|Iasi]] also played a crucial role in this movement. Characteristically the authors of the ''[[Geographia Neoteriki]]'', one of the most remarkable works of that era, [[Daniel Philippidis]] and [[Grigorios Konstantas]], were both educated in this environment.&lt;ref name=Kopecek&gt;{{cite book |first=Michal |last=Kopeček |title= Discourses of collective identity in Central and Southeast Europe (1770–1945): texts and commentaries |language=|year=2006|pages= 73–79|ref= |isbn=978-963-7326-52-3| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k5Vsjg508EYC&amp;pg=PA74 |publisher=Central European University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Roland |last=Sussex |first2= Eade|last2= John Christopher|title=Culture and nationalism in nineteenth-century Eastern Europe |language=|year=1985|page= 8|ref= |isbn=978-0-89357-146-7| url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=oMYPTZOCG8eAswbmse30DA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=eQZpAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Grigorios+Konstantas+in+their+New+Geography%22&amp;q=%22Daniil+Philippidis+and+Grigorios+Konstantas+in+their+New+Geography+of+1791%2C+one+of+the+most+remarkable+works+of+the+%27Neo-Hellenic+Enlightenment%27%2C+%22#search_anchor |publisher=Slavica Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

One effect was the creation of an [[Attic Greek|atticized]] form of Greek by linguistic purists, which was adopted as the official [[state language|language of the state]] and came to be known as ''[[Katharevousa]]'' (purified). This created [[diglossia]] in the Greek linguistic sphere, in which ''Katharevousa'' and the vernacular idiom known as [[Demotic Greek|''Dimotiki'']] were in conflict until the latter half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=BritannicaA/&gt;

The transmission of Enlightenment ideas into Greek thought also influenced the development of a national consciousness. The publication of the journal [[Hermes o Logios]] encouraged the ideas of the Enlightenment. The journal's objective was to advance Greek science, philosophy and culture.  Two of the main figures of the Greek Enlightenment, [[Rigas Feraios]] and [[Adamantios Korais]], encouraged Greek nationalists to pursue contemporary political thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= M. Kitromilides |first= Paschalis | title=The Dialectic of Intolerance: Ideological Dimensions of Ethnic Conflict | publisher=Journal of the Hellnice Diaspora | year=1979 | editor= |url= http://triceratops.brynmawr.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10066/5243/Kitromilides_6_4.pdf;jsessionid=D85E79913BFF8FCAF6D4228BE8B3CEAC?sequence=1 | isbn=  | page =4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek Enlightenment concerned not only language and the [[humanities]] but also the [[sciences]]. Some scholars such as [[Methodios Anthrakites]], [[Evgenios Voulgaris]], [[Athanasios Psalidas]], [[Balanos Vasilopoulos]] and [[Nikolaos Darbaris]] had a background in [[Mathematics]] and the [[Physical Sciences]] and published scientific books into Greek for use in Greek schools. [[Rigas Feraios]] also published an Anthology of Physics.

Many young [[Phanariot]] Greeks were among its members.

A '''necessary evil''' is an unsavoury thing (an [[evil]]) that someone believes must be done or accepted because it is [[Need|necessary]] to achieve a better outcome—especially because possible alternative courses of action or inaction are expected to be worse. It is the "lesser evil" in the [[lesser of two evils principle]], which provides that when given two bad choices, the one that is not as bad as the other is better than the one that is the greater threat.

==History==
The ''Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins'' asserts that "[t]he idea of a necessary evil goes back to Greek", describing the first necessary evil as [[marriage]], and further stating that, "The first example in English, from 1547, refers to a woman."&lt;ref&gt;Julia Cresswell, ''Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins'' (2010), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Fuller]], in his 1642 work, ''[[The Holy State and the Profane State]]'', made another of the earliest recorded uses of the phrase when he described the [[court jester]] as something that "...some count a necessary evil in a Court".&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Fuller]], ''[[The Holy State and the Profane State]]'' (1642), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Common Sense]]'', [[Thomas Paine]] described [[government]] as at best a "necessary evil".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Van Ingram, ''Philosophy and Other Bad Habits'' (2011), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evil as a concept is defined by the fact of acts done, considered to be contrary to morality, in other words, [[sin|sinful]], and the execution of any act by an individual, the defining value of the act, is harm is done (in an [[Archaism|archaic]] sense, this indicates acts causing repulsion or discomfort), &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/evil dictionary definition] [[Merriam-Webster]] Accessed February 11, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; additionally, the act is classified as, ''profoundly immoral''. &lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/evil dictionary definition] [[Oxford Dictionaries]] Accessed February 11, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

This being true, the use of the term "evil" in the phrase does not necessarily indicate that the thing being characterized as a "necessary evil" is something that is generally considered an "evil" in the sense of being [[immorality|immoral]] or the enemy of the good. In Fuller's use of the phrase, for example, there is no implication that court jesters are evil people, or having one serves an evil end. The term is most typically used to identify something that is merely an inconvenience or annoyance. Where an author suggests that, "[P]aperwork is a necessary evil, despised but handled with the understanding that a mistake – even a trivial one – could be costly."&lt;ref&gt;Sim B. Sitkin, Laura B. Cardinal, Katinka M. Bijlsma-Frankema, ''Organizational Control'' (2010), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; it is understood that the author is not deeming "[[wikt:paperwork|paperwork]]" to be wicked, immoral, or evil in senses comparable to those.Some thinkers specifically reject the idea of anything that is actually "evil" being necessary. This may manifest as an admonition for moral people to avoid participating in the activities that are perceived as evil:

{{quote|The concept of "necessary evil" is an idea that must be thoroughly rejected. Evil is not necessary, and to accept it as such is to perpetuate it. Evil must be opposed, rejected, and avoided at all costs. It should never be viewed as something that we must unavoidably and inevitably participate in. We trivialize evil when we refer to it as "necessary."&lt;ref&gt;Gebre Menfes Kidus, ''Mystery and Meaning: Christian Philosophy and Orthodox Meditations'' (2011), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alternately, this may manifest as a call to eliminate systems that contain aspects perceived as evil, and replace them with systems that avoid these aspects. For example, speaking of [[political parties]] in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], one author wrote:

{{quote|To say of anything that it is a necessary evil (it is often said of examinations, as of parties) is to give away all morality. It is almost a contradiction in terms. That which is necessary can hardly be evil. If that which is bad is unavoidable, then the game of morality is up. We are involved in a vicious circle from which there is no escape except in the denial of one premiss [sic] or of the other. Either the thing is not necessary, or it is not evil. A non-moral system might have no difficulty in admitting the conception of a necessary evil, but unfortunately it would also exclude the conception of evil altogether. Whatever may be argued philosophically on the point, the idea of a necessary evil is a fallacy as urged in excuse of party, for those who urge it are saying what they would deny if expressed in other terms.&lt;br&gt;

They would certainly say that it was wrong to charge a man with evil conduct who had done only what it was impossible for him to avoid doing. In that case they would say it was not evil; it was only unfortunate or sad. For the same reason party, if necessary, is not evil. But they do not want to say that, for they are convinced that party is an evil. Therefore they must take the alternative and admit that it is not necessary; and their excuse for party is gone.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Hodge, "Ex Parte" ''[[The Nineteenth Century (periodical)|The Nineteenth Century and After]]'' (1924), Vol. 95, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Italian physician [[Philip Mazzei]], in his correspondence with [[Thomas Jefferson]] in the 1770s, qualified a necessary evil as a restriction without which even greater evils would arise:

{{quote|Necessary Evils are those which cannot be avoided without incurring greater; Among the necessary Evils are the Laws themselves; because they prohibit us to do certain things, or oblige us to do certain others; and consequently they deprive us of a Portion of Liberty, which is the greatest Good. But what would be the Consequence if we had no Laws?&lt;ref&gt;Philip Mazzei, reported in Margherita Marchione and Stanley J. Idzerda, eds., ''Philip Mazzei: Selected Writings and Correspondence'' (1983), p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Grue''' and '''bleen''' are examples of logical [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] coined by [[Nelson Goodman]] in ''[[Fact, Fiction, and Forecast]]'' to illustrate the "'''new [[Problem of induction|riddle of induction]]'''". These predicates are unusual because their application is time-dependent; many have tried to solve the new riddle on those terms, but [[Hilary Putnam]] and others have argued such time-dependency depends on the language adopted, and in some languages it is equally true for natural-sounding predicates such as "green." For Goodman they illustrate the problem of projectible predicates and ultimately, which empirical generalizations are [[Scientific law|law-like]] and which are not.&lt;ref name="Goodman.1946"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Nelson Goodman| title=A Query on Confirmation| journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=Jul 1946| volume=43| number=14| pages=383–385| url=http://wordsmatter.caltech.edu/~franz/Confirmation%20and%20Induction/PDFs/Nelson%20Goodman%20-%20A%20Query%20on%20Confirmation.pdf| doi=10.2307/2020332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman.1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nelson Goodman|title=Fact, fiction, and forecast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i97_LdPXwrAC|accessdate=8 March 2012|year=1983|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-29071-6|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodman defined '''grue''' relative to an arbitrary but fixed time ''t'' as follows:&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Historically, Goodman used ''"[[V-E day]]"'' and ''"a certain time t"'' in ''A Query on Confirmation'' (p. 383) and ''Fact, fiction, and forecast'' (3rd ed. 1973, p. 73), respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; An object is grue [[if and only if]] it is observed before ''t'' and is green, or else is not so observed and is blue. An object is '''bleen''' if and only if it is observed before ''t'' and is blue, or else is not so observed and is green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP|title=Nelson Goodman|url-id=relativism|date=Apr 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand the problem Goodman posed, it is helpful to imagine some arbitrary future time ''t'', say January 1, {{#expr:{{#time:Y}} + 10}}. &lt;!-- The expression gives the current year plus ten, for a date guaranteed to be in the future no matter when this page is retrieved. --&gt; For all green things we observe up to time ''t'', such as [[emerald]]s and well-watered [[grass]], both the predicates ''green'' and ''grue'' apply.  Likewise for all blue things we observe up to time ''t'',   such as [[bluebird]]s or [[blue flower]]s, both the predicates ''blue'' and ''bleen'' apply. On January 2,  {{#expr:{{#time:Y}} + 10}}, however,  emeralds and well-watered grass are ''bleen'' and bluebirds or blue flowers are ''grue''.  Clearly, the predicates ''grue'' and ''bleen'' are not the kinds of predicates we use in everyday life or in science, but the problem is that they apply in just the same way as the predicates ''green'' and ''blue'' up until some future time ''t''. From our current perspective (i.e., before time ''t''), how can we say which predicates are more projectible into the future:  ''green'' and ''blue'' or ''grue'' and ''bleen''?

==The new riddle of induction==
In this section, Goodman's new riddle of induction is outlined in order to set the context for his introduction of the predicates ''grue'' and ''bleen'' and thereby illustrate their [[Philosophy|philosophical importance]].&lt;ref name="Goodman.1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Godfrey-Smith|title=Theory and Reality|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu|accessdate=23 October 2012|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-30063-4|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The old problem of induction and its dissolution===
Goodman poses [[Hume's problem of induction]] as a problem of the validity of the [[prediction]]s we make.  Since predictions are about what has yet to be observed and because there is no necessary connection between what has been observed and what will be observed, what is the justification for the predictions we make?  We cannot use deductive logic to infer predictions about future observations based on past observations because there are no valid rules of deductive logic for such inferences.  Hume's answer was that our observations of one kind of event following another kind of event result in our minds forming habits of regularity (i.e., associating one kind of event with another kind).  The predictions we make are then based on these regularities or habits of mind we have formed.

Goodman takes Hume's answer to be a serious one.  He rejects other philosophers' objection that Hume is merely explaining the origin of our predictions and not their justification.  His view is that Hume has identified something deeper.  To illustrate this, Goodman turns to the problem of justifying a [[Deductive system|system of rules of deduction]].  For Goodman, the validity of a deductive system is justified by its conformity to good deductive practice.  The justification of rules of a deductive system depends on our judgements about whether to reject or accept specific deductive inferences.  Thus, for Goodman, the problem of induction dissolves into the same problem as justifying a deductive system and while, according to Goodman, Hume was on the right track with habits of mind, the problem is more complex than Hume realized.

In the context of justifying rules of induction, this becomes the problem of confirmation of generalizations for Goodman.  However, the confirmation is not a problem of justification but instead it is a problem of precisely defining how evidence confirms generalizations.  It is with this turn that ''grue'' and ''bleen'' have their philosophical role in Goodman's view of induction.

===Projectible predicates===
[[File:US government example for Goodman's new riddle of induction_svg.svg|thumb|500px|US government example for time-dependent predicates: [[List of Presidents of the United States#List of presidents|Before March 1797]], arbitrarily many observations would support both version of the prediction ''"The [[United States Armed Forces|US forces]] were always [[commander-in-chief#United States|commanded]] by { {{su|p=[[George Washington]]|b=[[President of the United States|the &amp;nbsp; US &amp;nbsp; President]]}} }, hence they will be commanded by him in the future"'', which today is known as { {{su|p=false|b=true}} }, similar to ''"Emeralds were always { {{su|p=grue|b=green}} }, hence they will be so in the future"''.]]
The new riddle of induction, for Goodman, rests on our ability to distinguish ''lawlike'' from ''non-lawlike'' generalizations.  ''Lawlike'' generalizations are capable of confirmation while ''non-lawlike'' generalizations are not.  ''Lawlike'' generalizations are required for making predictions.  Using examples from Goodman, the generalization that all copper conducts electricity is capable of confirmation by a particular piece of copper whereas the generalization that all men in a given room are third sons is not ''lawlike'' but accidental.  The generalization that all copper conducts electricity is a basis for predicting that this piece of copper will conduct electricity.  The generalization that all men in a given room are third sons, however, is not a basis for predicting that a given man in that room is a third son.

What then makes some generalizations ''lawlike'' and others accidental?  This, for Goodman, becomes a problem of determining which predicates are projectible (i.e., can be used in ''lawlike'' generalizations that serve as predictions) and which are not. Goodman argues that this is where the fundamental problem lies. This problem, known as ''Goodman's paradox'', is as follows.  Consider the evidence that all [[emerald]]s examined thus far have been green.  This leads us to conclude (by induction) that all future emeralds will be green. However, whether this prediction is ''lawlike'' or not depends on the predicates used in this prediction.  Goodman observed that (assuming ''t'' has yet to pass) it is equally true that every emerald that has been observed is ''grue''.  Thus, by the same evidence we can conclude that all future emeralds will be ''grue''.  The new problem of induction becomes one of distinguishing projectible predicates such as ''green'' and ''blue'' from non-projectible predicates such as ''grue'' and ''bleen''.

Hume, Goodman argues, missed this problem.  We do not, by habit, form generalizations from all associations of events we have observed but only some of them. All past observed emeralds were green, and we formed a habit of thinking the next emerald will be green, but they were equally grue, and we do not form habits concerning grueness. ''Lawlike'' predictions (or projections) ultimately are distinguishable by the predicates we use. Goodman's solution is to argue that ''lawlike'' predictions are based on projectible predicates such as ''green'' and ''blue'' and not on non-projectible predicates such as ''grue'' and ''bleen'' and what makes predicates projectible is their ''entrenchment'', which depends on their successful past projections.  Thus, ''grue'' and ''bleen'' function in Goodman's arguments to both illustrate the new riddle of induction and to illustrate the distinction between projectible and non-projectible predicates via their relative entrenchment.

==Responses==
The most obvious response is to point to the artificially [[Logical disjunction|disjunctive]] definition of grue.  The notion of predicate ''entrenchment'' is not required. Goodman, however, noted that this move will not work.  If we take ''grue'' and ''bleen'' as primitive predicates, we can define green as "''grue'' if first observed before ''t'' and ''bleen'' otherwise", and likewise for blue.  To deny the acceptability of this disjunctive definition of green would be to [[Begging the question|beg the question]].

Another proposed resolution of the [[paradox]] (which Goodman addresses and rejects) that does not require predicate ''entrenchment'' is that "''x'' is grue" is not solely a predicate of ''x'', but of ''x'' and a time ''t''—we can know that an object is green without knowing the time ''t'', but we cannot know that it is grue. If this is the case, we should not expect "''x'' is grue" to remain true when the time changes. However, one might ask why "''x'' is green" is ''not'' considered a predicate of a particular time ''t''—the more common definition of ''green'' does not require any mention of a time ''t'', but the definition ''grue'' does. As we have just seen, this response also [[Begging the question|begs the question]] because ''blue'' can be defined in terms of ''grue'' and ''bleen'', which explicitly refer to time.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swinburne===
[[Richard Swinburne]] gets past the objection that green may be redefined in terms of ''grue'' and ''bleen'' by making a distinction based on how we test for the applicability of a predicate in a particular case. He distinguishes between qualitative and locational predicates. Qualitative predicates, like green, ''can'' be assessed without knowing the spatial or temporal relation of ''x'' to a particular time, place or event. Locational predicates, like ''grue'', ''cannot'' be assessed without knowing the spatial or temporal relation of ''x'' to a particular time, place or event, in this case whether ''x'' is being observed before or after time ''t''. Although green can be given a definition in terms of the locational predicates ''grue'' and ''bleen'', this is irrelevant to the fact that green meets the criterion for being a qualitative predicate whereas ''grue'' is merely locational. He concludes that if some ''x'''s under examination—like emeralds—satisfy both a qualitative and a locational predicate, but projecting these two predicates yields conflicting predictions, namely, whether emeralds examined after time ''t'' shall appear blue or green, we should project the qualitative predicate, in this case green.&lt;ref&gt;R. G. Swinburne, 'Grue', Analysis, Vol. 28, No. 4 (Mar., 1968), pp. 123-128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carnap===
[[Rudolf Carnap]] responded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Rudolf Carnap| title=On the Application of Inductive Logic| journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research| year=1947| volume=8| pages=133–148| url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~franz/Confirmation%20and%20Induction/PDFs/Rudolf%20Carnap%20-%20On%20the%20Application%20of%20Inductive%20Logic.pdf| doi=10.2307/2102920}} Here: p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; to Goodman's 1946 article. Carnap's approach to inductive logic is based on the notion of ''degree of confirmation'' ''c''(''h'',''e'') of a given hypothesis ''h'' by a given evidence ''e''.&lt;ref group=note&gt;p. 138; later on p. 143f, he uses another variant, ''c''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''h'',''e''), for which he gives a formula to compute actual values; different from Laplace's [[Rule of Succession]]. See Carnap's book ''Studies in inductive logic and probability'', Vol.1. University of California Press, 1971, for more details, in particular sect.IV.16 for ''c'', and app.A.1 for ''c''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''h'' and ''e'' are logical formulas expressed in a simple language ''L'' which allows for
* multiple quantification ("for every ''x'' there is a ''y'' such that ..."),
* unary and binary predicate symbols (properties and relations), and
* an equality relation "=".
The universe of discourse consists of denumerably many individuals, each of which is designated by its own constant symbol; such individuals are meant to be regarded as positions ("like space-time points in our actual world") rather than extended physical bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; A state description is a (usually infinite) conjunction containing every possible ground atomic sentence, either negated or unnegated; such a conjunction describes a possible state of the whole universe.&lt;ref&gt;This might be seen as corresponding to [[Wittgenstein]]'s [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus#Proposition 1|Tractatus]], Nr.1.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Carnap requires the following semantic properties:
* Atomic sentences must be logically independent of each other.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Tractatus Nr.1.21&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, different constant symbols must designate different and entirely separate individuals.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, if ''a'' and ''b'' had a part in common, then "''a'' is warm and ''b'' is not warm" would be an impossible combination.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, different predicates must be logically independent.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, "is a raven" and "is a bird" cannot both be admitted predicates, since the former would exclude the negation of the latter. As another example, "is warm" and "is warmer than" cannot both be predicates, since "''a'' is warm and ''b'' is warmer than ''a'' and ''b'' is not warm" is an impossible combination.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Carnap argues (p. 135) that logical independence is required for deductive logic as well, in order for the set of [[analytic-synthetic distinction#Frege and Carnap revise the Kantian definition|analytical sentences]] to be decidable.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The qualities and relations designated by the predicates must be simple, i.e. they must not be analyzable into simpler components.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p.136&lt;/ref&gt;  Apparently, Carnap had in mind an [[irreflexive]], [[partial order|partial]], and [[well-founded]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;"... carry the analysis [of complex predicates into simpler components] to the end", p.137&lt;/ref&gt; [[order theory|order]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;Carnap doesn't consider predicates that are mutually definable by each other, leading to a [[preorder]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''is simpler than''.
* The set of primitive predicates in ''L'' must be complete, i.e. every respect in which two positions in the universe may be found to differ by direct observation, must be expressible in ''L''.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p.138&lt;/ref&gt;
Carnap distinguishes three kinds of properties:
# Purely qualitative properties; that is, properties expressible without using individual constants, but not without primitive predicates,
# Purely positional properties; that is, properties expressible without primitive predicates, and
# Mixed properties; that is, all remaining expressible properties.
To illuminate this taxonomy, let ''x'' be a variable and ''a'' a constant symbol; then an example of 1. could be "''x'' is blue or ''x'' is non-warm", an example of 2. "''x'' = ''a''", and an example of 3. "''x'' is red and not ''x'' = ''a''".

Based on his theory of inductive logic sketched above, Carnap formalizes Goodman's notion of projectibility of a property ''W'' as follows: the higher the relative frequency of ''W'' in an observed sample, the higher is the probability that a non-observed individual has the property ''W''. Carnap suggests "as a tentative answer" to Goodman, that all purely qualitative properties are projectible, all purely positional properties are non-projectible, and mixed properties require further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p.146&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quine===
[[Willard Van Orman Quine]] discusses an approach to consider only "[[natural kind]]s" as projectible predicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Nicholas Rescher|title=Essays in Honor of [[Carl G. Hempel]]| publisher=D. Reidel |location=Dordrecht |author=Willard Van Orman Quine |contribution=Natural Kinds |year=1970 |pages=41–56 |contribution-url=http://fitelson.org/confirmation/quine_nk.pdf|display-editors=etal}} Reprinted in: {{cite book |last=Quine |first=W. V. |year=1969 |contribution=Natural Kinds |title=Ontological Relativity and other Essays |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |page=114 }}&lt;!---chapter=5---&gt;&lt;!---According to Quine's foreword to the latter book (p. 6 in the german translation), the reprint was issued earlier than the original.---&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
He first relates Goodman's grue paradox to [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]]'s [[raven paradox]] by defining two predicates ''F'' and ''G'' to be (simultaneously) projectible if all their shared instances count toward confirmation of the claim "each ''F'' is a ''G''".&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Then Hempel's paradox just shows that the complements of projectible predicates (such as "is a raven", and "is black") need not be projectible,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Observing a black raven is considered to confirm the claim "all ravens are black", while the [[contraposition|logically equivalent]] claim "all non-black things are non-ravens" is not considered to be confirmed by observing e.g. a green leaf.&lt;/ref&gt; while Goodman's paradox shows that "is green" is projectible, but "is grue" is not.

Next, Quine reduces projectibility to the subjective notion of ''similarity''. Two green emeralds are usually considered more similar than two grue ones if only one of them is green. Observing a green emerald makes us expect a similar observation (i.e., a green emerald) next time. Green emeralds are a ''natural kind'', but grue emeralds are not.  Quine investigates "the dubious scientific standing of a general notion of similarity, or of kind".&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 42"&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Both are basic to thought and language, like the logical notions of e.g. [[identity (philosophy)|identity]], [[negation]], [[disjunction]].  However, it remains unclear how to relate the logical notions to ''similarity'' or ''kind'';&lt;ref group=note&gt;Defining two things to be similar if they have all, or most, or many, properties in common doesn't make sense if properties, like [[mathematical set]]s, take things in every possible combination. (Quine, 1970, p. 43. Assuming a finite universe of ''n'' things, any two of them belong to exactly 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''-2&lt;/sup&gt; sets, and share exactly that number of [[extensional]] properties. [[Satosi Watanabe|Watanabe]] called this the "[[Ugly duckling theorem]]".)&lt;/ref&gt; Quine therefore tries to relate at least the latter two notions to each other.

'''Relation between similarity and kind'''

Assuming finitely many ''kinds'' only, the notion of ''similarity'' can be defined by that of ''kind'': an object ''A'' is more similar to ''B'' than to ''C'' if ''A'' and ''B'' belong jointly to more kinds&lt;ref group=note&gt;Rather than arbitrary sets&lt;/ref&gt; than ''A'' and ''C'' do.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 44"&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Quines uses this ternary relation in order to admit different levels of similarity, such that e.g. red things can be more similar to each other than just colored things.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vice versa, it remains again unclear how to define ''kind'' by ''similarity''.  Defining e.g. the kind of red things as the set of all things that are more similar to a fixed "paradigmatical" red object than this is to another fixed "foil" non-red object (cf. left picture) isn't satisfactory, since the degree of overall similarity, including e.g. shape, weight, will afford little evidence of degree of redness.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 44"/&gt; (In the picture, the yellow paprika might be considered more similar to the red one than the orange.)

An alternative approach inspired by [[Carnap]] defines a natural kind to be a [[set (mathematics)|set]] whose members are more similar to each other than each non-member is to at least one member.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=note&gt;Formally: A set ''K'' is a kind if ∀''Y'' ∉ ''K''. ∃ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''K''. ∀ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''K''.  (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is more similar to ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than to ''Y'').&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Goodman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Nelson Goodman| title=The Structure of Appearance| year=1951}} Here: p.163f.&lt;/ref&gt; argued, that this definition would make the set of all red round things, red wooden things, and round wooden things (cf. right picture) meet the proposed definition of a natural kind,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Each member of the set resembles each other member in being red, or in being round, or in being wooden, or even in several of these properties.&lt;/ref&gt; while "surely it is not what anyone means by a kind".&lt;ref group=note&gt;The set contains e.g. yellow [[croquet]] balls and red rubber balls, but not yellow rubber balls.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 45"&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

While neither of the notions of similarity and kind can be defined by the other, they at least vary together: if ''A'' is reassessed to be more similar to ''C'' than to ''B'' rather than the other way around, the assignment of ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' to kinds will be permuted correspondingly; and conversely.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 45"/&gt;

'''Basic importance of similarity and kind'''

In language, every general term owes its generality to some resemblance of the things [[Reference#Semantics|referred]] to.  [[Language acquisition|Learning]] to use a word depends on a double resemblance, viz. between the present and past circumstances in which the word was used, and between the present and past phonetic utterances of the word.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 42, 45–48&lt;/ref&gt;

Every reasonable expectation depends on resemblance of circumstances, together with our tendency to expect similar causes to have similar effects.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 42"/&gt; This includes any scientific experiment, since it can be reproduced only under similar, but not under completely identical, circumstances.  Already [[Heraclitus]]' famous saying "No man ever steps in the same river twice" highlighted the distinction between similar and identical circumstances.

'''Genesis of similarity and kind'''

In a [[Behaviorism|behavioral]] sense, humans and other animals have an innate standard of similarity.  It is part of our animal birthright, and characteristically animal in its lack of intellectual status, e.g. its alieness to mathematics and logic,&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; cf. bird example.

Induction itself is essentially [[Classical conditioning|animal expectation]] or habit formation.
[[Ostensive definition|Ostensive learning]]&lt;ref&gt;Investigated in more detail in {{cite book|author=Willard Van Orman Quine |title=The Roots of Reference | location=La Salle, Illinois | publisher=Open Court Publishing Co. |year=1974}} Sect.11&lt;/ref&gt;
is a case of induction, and a curiously comfortable one, since each man's spacing of qualities and kind is enough like his neighbor's.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the "brute irrationality of our sense of similarity" offers little reason to expect it being somehow in tune with the unanimated nature, which we never made.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Quine seems to allude to Vico's [[Giambattista Vico#The verum factum principle|verum factum principle]] here.&lt;/ref&gt;
Why inductively obtained theories about it should be trusted is the perennial philosophical [[problem of induction]].  Quine, following [[Satosi Watanabe|Watanabe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor1=Stanislas I. Dockx |editor2=Paul Bernays |editor2link=Paul Bernays |title=Information and Prediction in Science |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/41130 |location=New York |year=1965 |publisher=Academic Press | oclc=522269 | lccn=64-24655 | author=Satosi Watanabe |authorlink=Satosi Watanabe |chapter=Une Explication Mathématique du Classement d'Objets | pages=39&amp;mdash;76}} Here: p.41&lt;/ref&gt;
suggests [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory as an explanation: if people's innate spacing of qualities is a gene-linked trait, then the spacing that has made for the most successful inductions will have tended to predominate through [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;
However, this cannot account for the human ability to dynamically refine one's spacing of qualities in the course of getting acquainted with a new area.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Demonstrated by psychological experiments e.g. about classification of previously unseen [[Greeble (psychology)|artificial objects]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar predicates used in philosophical analysis==

===Quus===
In his book ''Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language'', [[Saul Kripke]] proposed a related argument that leads to skepticism about meaning rather than skepticism about induction, as part of his personal interpretation (nicknamed "[[Kripkenstein]]" by some&lt;ref&gt;John P. Burgess, Gideon Rosen (1999). ''A subject with no object: strategies for nominalistic interpretation of mathematics'', p. 53. {{ISBN|978-0-19-825012-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) of the [[private language argument]]. He proposed a new form of addition, which he called ''quus'', which is identical with "+" in all cases except those in which either of the numbers added are equal to or greater than 57; in which case the answer would be 5, i.e.:

::&lt;math&gt;x\text{ quus }y= \begin{cases} x+y &amp; \text{for }x,y &lt;57 \\[12pt] 5 &amp; \text{for } x\ge 57 \text{  or  } y\ge57 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

He then asks how, given certain obvious circumstances, anyone could know that previously when I thought I had meant "+", I had not actually meant ''quus''. Kripke then argues for an interpretation of [[Wittgenstein]] as holding that the meanings of words are not individually contained mental entities.

[[Image:Matthew Arnold - Project Gutenberg eText 16745.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The British poet and cultural critic [[Matthew Arnold]] adapted the German word ''Philister'' to English as the word ''philistine'' to denote [[anti-intellectualism]].]]

In the fields of [[philosophy]] and [[aesthetics|æsthetics]], the derogatory term '''philistinism''' describes “the manners, habits, and character, or mode of thinking of a philistine”, manifested as an [[anti-intellectualism|anti-intellectual]] social attitude that undervalues and despises [[art]] and [[beauty]], [[intellectualism|intellect]] and [[spirituality]].&lt;ref name="Unabridged 1951"&gt;''Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language – Unabridged'' (1951) p. 1260&lt;/ref&gt; A '''philistine''' person is a man or woman of smugly narrow mind and of [[Convention (norm)|conventional]] morality whose [[Economic materialism|materialistic]] views and tastes indicate a lack of and an indifference to cultural and æsthetic values.&lt;ref&gt;''College Edition: Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language'' (1962) p. 1099&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 19th century, the contemporary denotation of ''philistinism'', as the behaviour of "ignorant, ill-behaved persons lacking in culture or artistic appreciation, and only concerned with materialistic values" derives from Matthew Arnold's adaptation to English of the German word '''''Philister''''', as applied by university students in their antagonistic relations with the townspeople of [[Jena]], Germany, where, in 1689, a row resulted in several deaths.

In the aftermath, the university cleric addressed the town-vs-gown matter with an admonishing sermon "The Philistines Be Upon Thee", drawn from the ''[[Book of Judges]]'' (Chapt. 16, 'Samson vs the Philistines'), of the [[Tanakh]] and of the Christian [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;''Benét's Reader's Encyclopedia'' Third Edition (1987) p. 759&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Word Research and Word History'', the philologist [[Friedrich Kluge]] said that the word ''philistine'' originally had a positive meaning that identified a tall and strong man, such as [[Goliath]]; later the meaning changed to identify the "guards of the city".&lt;ref name="Kluge"&gt; Friedrich Kluge, ''Wortforschung und Wortgeschichte''&lt;/ref&gt;  

== History ==
In German usage, university students applied the term '''Philister''' (Philistine) to describe a person who was not trained at university; in the German social context, the term identified the man ('''Philister''') and the woman ('''Philisterin''') who was not of the university social set.&lt;ref name="Unabridged 1951"/&gt;

In English usage, as a descriptor of [[anti-intellectualism]], the term '''philistine'''—a person deficient in the culture of the [[liberal arts]]—was common British usage by the decade of 1820, which described the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]], merchant [[middle class]] of the [[Victorian Era]] (1837–1901), whose wealth rendered them indifferent to culture. In ''[[Culture and Anarchy|Culture and Anarchy: An Essay in Political and Social Criticism]]'' (1869), Matthew Arnold said:

{{Quotation|Now, the use of culture is that it helps us, by means of its spiritual standard of perfection, to regard wealth as but machinery, and not only to say as a matter of words that we regard wealth as but machinery, but really to perceive and feel that it is so. If it were not for this purging effect wrought upon our minds by culture, the whole world, the future, as well as the present, would inevitably belong to the Philistines. The people who believe most that our greatness and welfare are proved by our being very rich, and who most give their lives and thoughts to becoming rich, are just the people whom we call the Philistines. Culture says: “Consider these people, then, their way of life, their habits, their manners, the very tones of their voices; look at them attentively; observe the literature they read, the things which give them pleasure, the words which come forth out of their mouths, the thoughts which make the furniture of their minds; would any amount of wealth be worth having with the condition that one was to become just like these people by having it?”| Culture and Anarchy (1869) pp. 28–29. }}

The denotations and connotations of the terms ''philistinism'' and ''philistine'' have evolved to consistently describe the uncouth person who is hostile to [[art]], [[High culture|culture]], and the [[Intellectualism|life of the mind]], who, in their stead, prefers the life of [[economic materialism]] and [[conspicuous consumption]] as paramount human activities.

;17th century
Whilst involved in a lawsuit, the writer and poet [[Jonathan Swift]] (1667–1745), in the [[slang]] of his time, described a gruff bailiff as a philistine, someone who is considered a merciless enemy.&lt;ref name="Unabridged 1951"/&gt;

;18th century
The [[polymath]] [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1749–1832) described the philistine personality, by asking:

{{quotation| What is a philistine? A hollow gut, full of fear and hope that God will have mercy!}}

Goethe further described such men and women, by noting that:

{{Quotation|... the Philistine not only ignores all conditions of life which are not his own, but also demands that the rest of mankind should fashion its mode of existence after his own.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}}}

In the [[comedy of manners]] play, ''[[The Rivals]]'' (1775), [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] (1751–1816) identifies a violent [[Aristocracy|aristocrat]] as 'that bloodthirsty Philistine, Sir Lucius O'Trigger'.

;19th century
The philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) identified the philistine as a person who, for a lack of true unity, could only define [[Style (visual arts)|style]] in the negative.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

;20th century
* In the novel ''Der Ewige Spießer'' (The Eternal Philistine, 1930), the Austro–Hungarian writer [[Ödön von Horváth]] (1901–38) derided the cultural coarseness of the philistine man and his limited view of the world. The eponymous philistine is a failed businessman, a salesman of used cars, who aspires to the [[Conspicuous consumption|high-life]] of wealth; to realise that aspiration, he seeks to meet a rich woman who will support him, and so embarks upon a rail journey from Munich to Barcelona to seek her at the World's Fair.
* In the ''Lectures on Russian Literature'' (1981), in the essay 'Philistines and Philistinism' the writer [[Vladimir Nabokov]] (1899–1977) describes the philistine man and woman as:

{{Quotation|A full-grown person whose interests are of a [[Economic materialism|material]] and commonplace nature, and whose mentality is formed of the stock ideas and [[Convention (norm)|conventional]] ideals of his or her [[Social class|group]] and time. I have said “full-grown” person because the child or the adolescent who may look like a small philistine is only a small parrot mimicking the ways of confirmed vulgarians, and it is easier to be a parrot than to be a white heron. “Vulgarian” is more or less synonymous with “philistine”: the stress in a vulgarian is not so much on the conventionalism of a philistine, as on the vulgarity of some of his conventional notions. I may also use the terms “genteel” and “bourgeois”. Genteel implies the lace-curtain refined vulgarity, which is worse than simple coarseness. To burp in company may be rude, but to say “excuse me” after a burp is genteel, and thus worse than vulgar. The term bourgeois I use following [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]], not [[Karl Marx|Marx]]. Bourgeois, in Flaubert's sense, is a state of mind, not a state of pocket. A bourgeois is a smug philistine, a dignified vulgarian . . . generally speaking, philistinism presupposes a certain advanced state of civilization, where, throughout the ages, certain [[tradition]]s have accumulated in a heap and have started to stink.&lt;ref name="NabokovRussianLit"&gt;Nabokov, ''Lectures on Russian Literature'', essay ''Philistines and Philistinism''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* In the ''Lectures on Literature'' (1982), in speaking of the novel ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' (1856), about the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] wife of a country doctor, Nabokov said that philistinism is manifest in the [[Prude|prudish]] attitude demonstrated by the man or the woman who accuses a work of [[art]] of being [[obscene]].&lt;ref&gt;Nabokov, ''Lectures on Literature'', lecture on ''Madame Bovary''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philosophical ethology''' is a rather young multidisciplinary research field gathering [[natural science]]s, social science, human studies and dedicates to the issue of animal subjectivity. It is about an ontological concept needing a philosophical place other than a descriptive issue, just as it was in the 19th century.

== History ==
Philosophical ethology develops from the thought of continental philosophers, which researches involve ethology, philosophy and anthropology. Those authors had taken up the challenges coming from biology, phenomenology, critical theory, the Animal Studies and post-human philosophy. These are all disciplines dealing, each in its own way, with non-human animals and the interactions among living beings, in order to propose a new paradigm able to go beyond the tricks of the anthropocentrism, still alive and kicking underneath the traditional theories.

The mean critics by those authors is the Cartesian heiress of automata:&lt;ref&gt;(IT) René Descartes, Discorso sul metodo, Opere, I, Roma-Bari, Laterza, [1637] 1967, pp. 129-182.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the classical ethology and behaviourism have described how the animal machine would work and which were the mechanisms regulating processes, nevertheless these authors did not challenge the mean idea, that is an animal is not a machine. Hence the need to elaborate a new multidisciplinary approach able to interpret the animal subjectivity ontologically speaking, and the different ontology correlated issues, such as the cultural dimensions, symbolicity and materiality in non-human animals and their intra and interspecific relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccat-lab.org/ccat-research-symposium-event-what-is-philosophical-ethology/ Report del convegno "What is Philosophical Ethology?" tenuto alla Curtin University (Australia) il 22 luglio 2015], ccat-lab.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leading figures ==
Three recent issues of magazine ''Angelaki. Journal of the Theoretical Humanities''&lt;ref&gt;(EN) Brett Buchanan, Jeffrey Bussolini &amp; Matthew Chrulew, [http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/cang20/current Philosophical ethology], in Angelaki. Journal of the Theoretical Humanities, I, II, III, Routledge, 2014 - 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; have explored the thought of three scholars considered among the most influential voices in the field of philosophical ethology by di editors of the magazine, Brett Buchanan, Jeffrey Bussolini and Matthew Chrulew: the three authos are Vinciane Despret, Dominique Lestel and Roberto Marchesini.

=== [[Vinciane Despret]] ===
Belgian philosopher and professo at the university of liege, Vinciane Despret has written many essays and articles about the history of ethology, psicology and human-animal relationship.&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Vinciane Despret, Quando il lupo vivrà con l'agnello. Sguardo umano e comportamenti animali, Milano, Eleuthera, 2004, {{ISBN|978-8885060906}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Vinciane Despret, Hans, il cavallo che sapeva contare, Milano, Eleuthera, 2005, {{ISBN|978-8885060982}}.&lt;/ref&gt; All along her career, Despert has worked together with few authors from different disciplines (ethology, arts, literature) and with many non-human animals (elephants, mice, rats, monkeys).&lt;ref&gt;(EN) Brett Buchanan, Matthew Chrulew &amp; Jeffrey Bussolini, [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0969725X.2015.1039821 On asking the right questions. An interview with Vinciane Despret], in Angelaki. Philosophical ethology II - Vinciane Despret, vol. 20, nº 2, Roudledge, 2015, pp. 165-178.&lt;/ref&gt; These encounters allowed her to build a unique research path.

In Despret’s writings, what is peculiar is the methodological approach and her anecdotal and idiosyncratic style: the author chooses to tell stories about animals (or, better, stories of relationship among animals, humans included) rather than to write about animals.
Focal point to the authors is ''making the right questions'' to non-human animals.&lt;ref&gt;(EN) Vinciane Despret&amp;Brett Buchanan, What Would Animals Say If We Asked the Right Questions?, in Posthumanities, Minneapolis, University Of Minnesota Press, 2016, {{ISBN|978-0816692392}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that animals are not texts to hermeneutically interpret, not object to quest via scientific experiments, but they are subjects able to provide their own answers to the questions interesting to them.

Within philosophical ethology, Despret has stressed the repetitivity of any interspecific dialogue: non-human animals are being transformed by the encounter with the human beings, and, in the same way, human beings result transformed by the dialogue with the non-human. Despret’s stories are full of examples got by researchers, farmers, trainers – along with likewise important autobiographical reports – proving the enrichment coming from the encounter with the non-human animals.

=== Dominique Lestel ===
A French philosopher and ethologist, Lestel is "Maître de conférences" at École Normale Supérieure of Paris and director of a research team about eco-anthropology and etnonlogy at the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Muséum national d’histoire naturelle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://savoirs.ens.fr/conferencier.php?id=402 Dominique Lestel's Academic Positions], savoirs.ens.fr.&lt;/ref&gt;

His credit is stressing how a cultural phenomenon is not a human peculiarity.&lt;ref&gt;(FR) Dominique Lestel, Les origines animales de la culture, in Champs Essais, Paris, Flammarion, 2001, {{ISBN|978-2-0812-23042}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To Lestel, it necessary to see at anthropo-poiesis with an evolutionary and pluralist lens and at culture as a domain no longer apart from nature. It is necessary to become aware that we live in a multi-species society where each species produces their own kind of culture. This proximity of space and time among beings from different species allows the emergence of few sincere friendship and relationship, that have a historical, ethical and political importance, to Lestel.&lt;ref&gt;(EN) Matthew Chrulew, [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0969725X.2014.976069 The animal outside the text. An interview with Dominique Lestel], in Angelaki. Philosophical ethology I: Dominique Lestel, vol. 19, nº 3, Routledge, 2014, pp. 187-196.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, during the International days of study GIS about human-animal held in Bologna, Lestel has rolled out his zoo-futurism, a philosophical artistic trend aiming to "re-animalise" the human being.&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Dominique Lestel, [https://ilmanifesto.it/login L’animale è l’avvenire dell’umano. Guida allo zoo-futurismo], in il Manifesto, 29 ottobre 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roberto Marchesini ===
An Italian philosopher, ethologist and zooanthopologist, Marchesini is director of Siua (School of Human-Animal interaction), of Study Centre of post-human philosophy and professor at few Italian universities. For over 20 years, he is leading a multidisciplinary project research about Zooanthropology, posts-human philosophy and bioethics to demonstrate that non-human animals have a referent role during the identity structuring (anthropo-poiesis)&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Roberto Marchesini, [http://www.metis.progedit.com/anno-iii-numero-1-giugno-2013-formare-tra-scienza-tecnica-tecnologia-temi/99-saggi/489-antropodecentramento-e-ibridazioni-progetto-posthuman-e-profilatura-identitaria.html Antropodecentramento e ibridazioni. Progetto Posthuman e profilatura identitaria], in MeTis. Mondi educativi, temi indagini suggestioni, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and the philosophical consequences coming from this kind of relationship.

Main concepts in Marchesini’s thought are Zootropy and animal epiphany. With the term zootropy, Marchesini underlines the natural human tendency to turn to non-humans, like a kind of ''biophilia''&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Edward Osborne Wilson, Biophilia, Harvard University Press, 1986, {{ISBN|9780674074422}}.&lt;/ref&gt; rooted in our species that see in ethero-specifics some social counterparts able to contribute to anthropo-poiesis processes.&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Roberto Marchesini, Fondamenti di zooantropologia. La zooantropologia teorica, Bologna, Apeiron, 2014, {{ISBN|9788887690132}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other side, with the concept of "animal epiphany", Marchesini points out the characteristic of enunciation and revelation coming from humans-non humans relationship. Animal diversity let human being imagine new existential paths – in the flight of a bird, human being cannot see just the phenomenon per se, but perceive a new dimension of the thinking ''it is possible to fly''&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Roberto Marchesini, Epifania animale. L'oltreuomo come rivelazione, Milano, Mimesis, 2014, p. 71, {{ISBN|978-8857521350}}.&lt;/ref&gt; – and experiment an hybridational tension leading to identity slidings.

With the essay ''Philosophical ethology'',&lt;ref&gt;(IT) Roberto Marchesini, Etologia filosofica. Alla ricerca della soggettività animale, Milano, Mimesis, 2016, {{ISBN|978-8857532332}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marchesini focus on subjectivity. To him, subjectivity is foundation to conscience, not the opposite. Animals get constantly engaged from the external world through new occurrences asking for creativity and initiative not explicable with any automatism.&lt;ref&gt;(IT) R. Marchesini, Intelligenza emotiva versus intelligenza cognitiva, in Pluriverso, vol. 3, La Nuova Italia, 2001, pp. 22-33.&lt;/ref&gt; From this point of view, to Marchesini, desire connects animals and the world, desire make them acting in their present.

'''Philosophy of Eating''' is a concept of food production and nutritional philosophy that matches the source and result of health together.

The core of these points of view is to attach a mental state of mind with the sources of proper agricultural food sources in a balance of harmony in part because the sources have freshness and purity. Modern assertions are that the fresh foods contain vital [[micronutrients]] generally lost in most food processing.

Additional issues are brought to light in modern times where [[advertising]] along with subtle cues in color or related sensory inputs are masking substandard or even toxic ingredients present.  The masquerade of dyes and organic chemicals from non-food sources become key in the current vernacular of various publications and nutrition movements.

==History==
As a book [[The Philosophy of Eating]] by author [[Albert Jones Bellows|Andrew Bellows]] in the late 1860s,.&lt;ref&gt;Albert J. Bellows (1868) [https://books.google.com/books/about/Philosophy_of_Eating_1868.html?id=7Td5xyWSFb4C originated at the Harvard University Library, subsequently published by Hurd and Houghton] 1867.&lt;/ref&gt; The author portrayed the concepts in light of science as well as views drawn from religiosity common in the middle to late 1860's era.  So with a biblical fervor as an original direction of inspiration the author then supplies a variety of what was then scientific knowledge to correctly apply that in agriculture to the table in the kitchen. Fresh fruits and grains as those so ordained in the work making up a core of inputs to the meats of the day looked upon in detail most up to that time obtained from the local butcher.

More recent incarnations derived from this are exhibited in [[raw foodism]] for people. This manifestation seen in a variety of areas including [[vegan|vegan food preparation]] and offshoots related. The [[micronutrients]] [[amylase]]s, [[protease]]s, and [[lipase]]s aid digestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holisticjunction.com/articles/8019.html |title="Digestive Enzymes do More than just Aid Digestion", an article at Holistic Junction |publisher=Holisticjunction.com |date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2010-05-12 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; to a variety of shared characteristics of the origins of food spelled out in the 1860s book started to mainstream more so as a backlash to &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/ART02840/How-to-Eat-in-Seven-Words.html |title="How to Eat in Seven Words", an article at Dr. Andrew Weil |author=Brad Lemley|publisher=drweil.com |date=2011-01-28 |accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; simplify the sourcing to consumption in thought as well a contexts for acceptability.

Contemporary revisiting of this in a new updated book continuing is a more secular scientific work by [[George Davey]] who published a 2013 book called ''Break the Trance''.  [[The Philosophy of Eating Break the Trance|Break the Trance]]
.&lt;ref&gt;George Davey (2013) [http://lccn.loc.gov/2013938024 The Library of Congress, published by Corn Publishing]  2013.&lt;/ref&gt; With more up to date scientific analysis than the treatise from [[Albert Jones Bellows|Andrew Bellows]] the author describes how mechanisms of discovery, chemical masks and the driving forces beyond that of the earlier works in the topic.

==Experiences==

Philosophy extends from the scientific observation to how we as people treat our animals versus ourselves in dietary habits from youth through to adulthood.

Reviving the lost art of nourishing ourselves &lt;ref&gt;Carrien and Tamra (2006) [http://foodthatnourishes.blogspot.com/2006/10/philosophy-of-eating.html 'Philosophy of Eating', the real food revolution]  2006&lt;/ref&gt; blogged about in part to illustrate this as a proper approach.

Though cited in [[The Philosophy of Eating Break the Trance|Break the Trance]], health philosophy of eating like our paleolithic ancestors is found in a variety directions including mineral intake.

==Contrast==

Processed foods get celebration along with trepidation in newer periodicals in 2013. Scientific American and Wired devote entire issues to food content and philosophy of nutrition.

Particularly, the scientific basis is now better understood and psychological remediation or behavior patterns are more amenable to that of a reader in modern times contrasted with processed food celebration by.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Kim (2013) [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=processed-food-a-two-million-year-history 'Processed Food: A 2-Million-Year History', It is the dark force, we're told, behind the obesity epidemic, the death of the family farm and Tang...]  2013&lt;/ref&gt; The continued strength of industrialized food troubles some people though.

[[Image:Karl Popper.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Karl Popper]]]]
In [[philosophy]] and [[models of scientific inquiry]], '''postpositivism''' (also called '''''postempiricism''''') is a [[metatheoretical]] stance that critiques and amends [[positivism]]&lt;ref name="Bergman2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bergman|first1=Mats|article=Positivism|title=The International Encyclopedia of Communication Theory and Philosophy|date=2016|isbn=9781118766804|page=1–5|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118766804.wbiect248/full|ref=IntEncycCTP}}&lt;/ref&gt;. While positivists emphasize independence between the researcher and the researched person (or object), postpositivists accept that theories, background, knowledge and values of the researcher can influence what is observed.&lt;ref name="Robson2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robson|first=Colin|title=Real World Research. A Resource for Social Scientists and Practitioner-Researchers (Second Edition)|year=2002|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden|isbn=0-631-21305-8|pages=624}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postpositivists pursue objectivity by recognizing the possible effects of biases.&lt;ref name="Robson2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Katherine|title=Communication theories : perspectives, processes, and contexts|date=2007|publisher=Peking University Press|location=Beijing|isbn=9787301124314|page=35-45|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TaylorLindlof2011" /&gt; While positivists emphasize quantitative methods, postpositivists consider both quantitative and qualitative methods to be valid approaches&lt;ref name="TaylorLindlof2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Thomas R.|last2=Lindlof|first2=Bryan C.|title=Qualitative communication research methods|date=2011|publisher=SAGE|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn=978-1412974738|page=5-13|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Philosophy==

===Epistemology===
Postpositivists believe that human knowledge is based not on a priori assessments from an objective individual&lt;ref name="TaylorLindlof2011"/&gt;, but rather upon human ''[[conjectural|conjectures]]''. As human knowledge is thus unavoidably conjectural, the assertion of these conjectures are ''warranted'', or more specifically, justified by a set of ''[[Theory of justification|warrant]]s'', which can be modified or withdrawn in the light of further investigation.  However, postpositivism is not a form of [[relativism]], and generally retains the idea of [[objective truth]].

===Ontology===
Postpositivists believe that a reality exists, but, unlike positivists, they believe reality can be known only imperfectly&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt; and probabilistically.&lt;ref name="Robson2002" /&gt; Postpositivists also draw from [[social constructionism]] in forming their understanding and definition of reality.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;

===Axiology===
While positivists believe that research is or can be value-free or value-neutral, postpositivists take the position that bias is undesired but inevitable, and therefore the investigator must work to detect and try to correct it. Postpositivists work to understand how their [[axiology]] (i.e. values and beliefs) may have influenced their research, including through their choice of measures, populations, questions, and definitions, as well as through their interpretation and analysis of their work.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;

==History==
Historians identify two types of positivism: classical positivism, an empirical tradition first described by [[Claude_Henri_de_Rouvroy,_comte_de_Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]] and [[Auguste Comte]]&lt;ref name="Bergman2016" /&gt;, and [[logical positivism]], which is most strongly associated with the [[Vienna Circle]], which met near Vienna, Austria, in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt; Postpositivism is the name D.C. Phillips&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt; gave to a group of critiques and amendments which apply to both forms of positivism.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;

One of the first thinkers to criticize [[logical positivism]] was [[Karl Popper|Sir Karl Popper]]. He advanced [[Falsifiability|falsification]] in lieu of the logical positivist idea of [[verificationism]].&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;. Falsificationism argues that it is impossible to verify that beliefs about universals or unobservables are true, though it is possible to reject false beliefs if they are phrased in a way amenable to falsification. [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s idea of [[paradigm shift]]s offers a broader critique of logical positivism, arguing that it is not simply individual theories but whole [[worldview]]s that must occasionally shift in response to evidence.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt; 

Postpositivism is not a rejection of the [[scientific method]], but rather a reformation of positivism to meet these critiques.  It reintroduces the basic assumptions of positivism: the possibility and desirability of [[objective truth]], and the use of [[experiment]]al [[methodology]]. The work of philosophers [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]] and [[Ian Hacking]] are representative of these ideas.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Postpositivism of this type is described in [[social science]] guides to research methods.&lt;ref name="soc_rsch_Trochim"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trochim|first1=William|title=Social Research Methods Knowledge Base|url=https://socialresearchmethods.net/kb|website=socialresearchmethods.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Structure and Nature of a Postpositivist Theory==

Robert Dubin describes the basic components of a postpositivist theory as being composed of basic "units" or ideas and topics of interest, "laws of interactions" among the units, and a description of the "boundaries" for the theory.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt; A postpositivist theory also includes "empirical indicators" to connect the theory to observable phenomena, and hypotheses that are testable using the scientific method.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;

According to Thomas Kuhn, a postpositivist theory can be assessed on the basis of whether it is "[[Accuracy and precision|accurate]]", "[[Consistency|consistent]]", "has broad scope", "[[Occam's razor|parsimonious]]", and "fruitful".&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;

The '''problem of evil''' refers to the question of how to reconcile the existence of [[evil]] with an [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] and [[Omniscience|omniscient]] [[God]] (see [[theism]]).&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil The Problem of Evil]", Michael Tooley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential"&gt;The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/evil-evi.htm The Evidential Problem of Evil]", Nick Trakakis&lt;/ref&gt; An '''argument from evil''' claims that because evil exists, either God does not exist or does not have all three of those properties. Attempts to show the contrary have traditionally been discussed under the heading of [[theodicy]]. Besides philosophy of religion, the problem of evil is also important to the field of [[theology]] and [[ethics]].

The problem of evil is often formulated in two forms: the logical problem of evil and the evidential problem of evil. The logical form of the argument tries to show a logical impossibility in the coexistence of God and evil,&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepLogical"/&gt; while the evidential form tries to show that given the evil in the world, it is improbable that there is an omnipotent, omniscient, and wholly good God.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt; The problem of evil has been extended to non-human life forms, to include animal suffering from natural evils and human [[animal cruelty|cruelty]] against them.&lt;ref name=inwagenp120/&gt;

Responses to various versions of the problem of evil, meanwhile, come in three forms: refutations, defenses, and theodicies. A wide range of responses have been made against these arguments. There are also many discussions of evil and associated problems in other philosophical fields, such as [[secular ethics]],&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas J. Rengger, ''Moral Evil and International Relations'', in ''[[SAIS Review]]'' 25:1, Winter/Spring 2005, pp. 3–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kivy, ''Melville's Billy and the Secular Problem of Evil: the Worm in the Bud'', in ''[[The Monist]]'' (1980), 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kekes |first=John |authorlink=John Kekes |title=Facing Evil |publisher=Princeton UP |year=1990 |location=Princeton |url= |id= |isbn=0-691-07370-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[evolutionary ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Anders, ''The Evolution of Evil'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lawrence C. Becker |author2=Charlotte B. Becker |title= Encyclopedia of Ethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KfeOAQAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-35096-3|pages=147–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as usually understood, the "problem of evil" is posed in a [[theological]] context.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;

The problem of evil acutely applies to monotheistic religions such as [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], and [[Judaism]] that believe in a monotheistic God who is omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent;&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/hum_303/evil.html Problem of Evil], Paul Brians, Washington State University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen D. O'Leary|title=Arguing the Apocalypse |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=slB8WHY9B6QC&amp;pg=PA34 |year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-535296-2 |pages=34–35 }}, Quote: "As Max Weber notes, however, it is in monotheistic religions that this problem becomes acute."&lt;/ref&gt; but the question of "why does evil exist?" has also been studied in religions that are non-theistic or polytheistic, such as [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Jainism]].&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p141"/&gt;&lt;ref name=arthurhermanp5/&gt;

==Formulation and detailed arguments==
{{see|Existence of God}}
The problem of evil refers to the challenge of reconciling belief in an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent God, with the existence of evil and suffering in the world.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p141"/&gt;&lt;ref name=boydp56&gt;Gregory A.

===Logical problem of evil&lt;!--'Logical problem of evil' redirects here--&gt;===
Originating with Greek philosopher [[Epicurus]],&lt;ref&gt;The formulation may have been wrongly attributed to Epicurus by Lactantius, who, from his Christian perspective, regarded Epicurus as an [[atheist]]. According to Mark Joseph Larrimore, (2001), ''The Problem of Evil'', pp. xix–xxi. Wiley-Blackwell. According to [[Reinhold F. Glei]], it is settled that the argument of theodicy is from an academical source which is not only not epicurean, but even anti-epicurean. Reinhold F. Glei, ''Et invidus et inbecillus. Das angebliche Epikurfragment bei Laktanz, De ira dei 13, 20–21'', in: ''Vigiliae Christianae'' 42 (1988), pp. 47–58&lt;/ref&gt; the '''logical argument from evil'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is as follows:

# If an [[omnipotent]], [[omnibenevolent]] and [[omniscient]] god exists, then evil does not.
# There is evil in the world.
# Therefore, an omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient god does not exist.

This argument is of the form [[modus tollens]], and is [[logically valid]]: If its premises are true, the conclusion follows of necessity.  To show that the first premise is plausible, subsequent versions tend to expand on it, such as this modern example:&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;
# God exists.
# God is omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient.
# An omnipotent being has the power to prevent that evil from coming into existence.
# An omnibenevolent being would want to prevent all evils.
# An omniscient being knows every way in which evils can come into existence, and knows every way in which those evils could be prevented.
# A being who knows every way in which an evil can come into existence, who is able to prevent that evil from coming into existence, and who wants to do so, would prevent the existence of that evil.
# If there exists an omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient God, then no evil exists.
# Evil exists (logical contradiction).

Both of these arguments are understood to be presenting two forms of the ''logical'' problem of evil. They attempt to show that the assumed [[proposition]]s lead to a [[logical]] [[contradiction]] and therefore cannot all be correct. Most philosophical debate has focused on the propositions stating that God cannot exist with, or would want to prevent, all evils (premises 3 and 6), with defenders of theism (for example, Leibniz) arguing that God could very well exist with and allow evil in order to achieve a greater good.

If God lacks any one of these qualities—omniscience, omnipotence, or omnibenevolence—then the logical problem of evil can be resolved. [[Process theology]] and [[open theism]] are other positions that limit God's omnipotence and/or omniscience (as defined in traditional theology). [[Dystheism]] is the belief that God is not wholly good.

===Evidential problem of evil&lt;!--'Logical problem of evil' and 'Evidential argument from evil' redirect here--&gt;===
[[File:Deerfire high res edit.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[William L. Rowe]]'s example of [[natural evil]]: "In some distant forest lightning strikes a dead tree, resulting in a forest fire. In the fire a fawn is trapped, horribly burned, and lies in terrible agony for several days before death relieves its suffering."&lt;ref name=rowe336&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowe|first=William L.|authorlink=William L. Rowe|year=1979|title=The Problem of Evil and Some Varieties of Atheism|journal=American Philosophical Quarterly|volume=16|pages=336–37|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowe also cites the example of human evil where an innocent child is a victim of violence and thereby suffers.&lt;ref name=rowe336/&gt;]]

The '''evidential problem of evil'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (also referred to as the probabilistic or inductive version of the problem) seeks to show that the existence of evil, although logically consistent with the existence of God, counts against or lowers the [[probability]] of the truth of theism. As an example, a critic of Plantinga's idea of "a mighty nonhuman spirit" causing natural evils may concede that the existence of such a being is not logically impossible but argue that due to lacking scientific evidence for its existence this is very unlikely and thus it is an unconvincing explanation for the presence of natural evils. Both absolute versions and relative versions of the evidential problems of evil are presented below.

A version by [[William L. Rowe]]:
# There exist instances of intense suffering which an omnipotent, omniscient being could have prevented without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.
# An omniscient, wholly good being would prevent the occurrence of any intense suffering it could, unless it could not do so without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.
# (Therefore) There does not exist an omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good being.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;

Another by [[Paul Draper (philosopher)|Paul Draper]]:
# Gratuitous evils exist.
# The hypothesis of indifference, ''i.e.'', that if there are supernatural beings they are indifferent to gratuitous evils, is a better explanation for (1) than theism.
# Therefore, evidence prefers that no god, as commonly understood by theists, exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Draper |title=Pain and Pleasure: An Evidential Problem for Theists |journal=Noûs |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=331–50 | year=1989 |doi=10.2307/2215486 |publisher=Noûs, Vol. 23, No. 3 |ref=harv |jstor=2215486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problem of evil and animal suffering===
{{See also|Wild animal suffering}}

The problem of evil has also been extended beyond human suffering, to include suffering of animals from cruelty, disease and evil.&lt;ref name=inwagenp120&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter van Inwagen|title=The Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iQhUrE8BYFIC |year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-954397-7 |pages=120, 123–26, context: 120–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One version of this problem includes animal suffering from natural evil, such as the violence and fear faced by animals from predators, natural disasters, over the history of evolution.&lt;ref name=Creeganp44&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan|title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB1pAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-993185-9 |pages=44–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also referred to as the Darwinian problem of evil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Murray |title=Nature Red in Tooth and Claw: Theism and the Problem of Animal Suffering |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZFNf9EwSSYC |year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press  |isbn=978-0-19-155327-1 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=almeidap193/&gt; after Charles Darwin who expressed it as follows:&lt;ref name="Murray2008"/&gt;

The second version of the problem of evil applied to animals, and avoidable suffering experienced by them, is one caused by some human beings, such as from animal cruelty or when they are shot or slaughtered. This version of the problem of evil has been used by scholars including [[John Hick]] to counter the responses and defenses to the problem of evil such as suffering being a means to perfect the morals and greater good because animals are innocent, helpless, amoral but sentient victims.&lt;ref name=inwagenp120/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Diogenes Allen |editor=Marilyn McCord Adams and Robert Merrihew Adams|title=The Problem of Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqNwUSj7U7QC |year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-824866-8 |pages=204–06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William L.

== Responses, defences and theodicies ==
Responses to the problem of evil have occasionally been classified as ''defences'' or ''theodicies;'' however, authors disagree on the exact definitions.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia |first=Ted |last=Honderich |authorlink=Ted Honderich |year=2005 |title=theodicy |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |isbn=0-19-926479-1 |quote=[[John Hick]], for example, proposes a theodicy, while [[Alvin Plantinga]] formulates a defence. The idea of human free will often appears in a both of these strategies, but in different ways.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, a ''defense'' against the problem of evil may refer to attempts to defuse the logical problem of evil by showing that there is no logical incompatibility between the existence of evil and the existence of God. This task does not require the identification of a plausible explanation of evil, and is successful if the explanation provided shows that the existence of God and the existence of evil are logically compatible. It need not even be true, since a false though coherent explanation would be sufficient to show logical compatibility.&lt;ref&gt;For more explanation regarding contradictory propositions and possible worlds, see Plantinga's "God, Freedom and Evil" (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans 1974), 24–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[theodicy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Coined by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] from [[Greek language|Greek]] θεός (theós), "god" and δίκη (díkē), "justice", may refer to the project of "justifying God"—showing that God's existence is compatible with the existence of evil.&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, is more ambitious, since it attempts to provide a plausible justification—a morally or philosophically sufficient reason—for the existence of evil and thereby rebut the "evidential" argument from evil.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt; [[Richard Swinburne]] maintains that it does not make sense to assume there are greater goods that justify the evil's presence in the world unless we know what they are—without knowledge of what the greater goods could be, one cannot have a successful theodicy.&lt;ref name=swinburne05&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia |first=Richard |last=Swinburne |authorlink=Richard Swinburne |year=2005 |title=evil, the problem of |editor=Ted Honderich |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |isbn=0-19-926479-1 |editor-link=Ted Honderich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, some authors see arguments appealing to [[demon]]s or the [[fall of man]] as indeed logically possible, but not very ''plausible'' given our knowledge about the world, and so see those arguments as providing defences but not good theodicies.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;

The above argument is set against numerous versions of the problem of evil that have been formulated.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepLogical"&gt;The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/evil-log.htm The Logical Problem of Evil]", James R. Beebe&lt;/ref&gt; These versions have included philosophical and theological formulations.

===Skeptical theism===
{{Main|Skeptical theism}}
Skeptical theism defends the problem of evil by asserting that God allows an evil to happen in order to prevent a greater evil or to encourage a response that will lead to a greater good.&lt;ref name=wilks31&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Wilks |editor=Justin P. McBrayer and Daniel Howard-Snyder|title=The Blackwell Companion to The Problem of Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0ScAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1-118-60797-8 |chapter=Chapter 31, for context see Chapters 29 and 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a rape or a murder of an innocent child is defended as having a God's purpose that a human being may not comprehend, but which may lead to lesser evil or greater good.&lt;ref name=wilks31/&gt; This is called skeptical theism because the argument aims to encourage self-skepticism, either by trying to rationalize God's possible hidden motives, or by trying to explain it as a limitation of human ability to know.&lt;ref name=wilks31/&gt;&lt;ref name="DoughertyMcBrayer2014"/&gt; The greater good defense is more often argued in religious studies in response to the evidential version of the problem of evil,&lt;ref name="DoughertyMcBrayer2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Trent Dougherty|author2=Justin P.

==== "Greater good" responses ====
The [[omnipotence paradox]]es, where evil persists in the presence of an all powerful God, raise questions as to the nature of God's omnipotence. There is the further question of how an interference would negate and subjugate the concept of free will, or in other words result in a totalitarian system that creates a lack of freedom. Some solutions propose that omnipotence does not require the ability to actualize the logically impossible. "Greater good" responses to the problem make use of this insight by arguing for the existence of goods of great value which God cannot actualize without also permitting evil, and thus that there are evils he cannot be expected to prevent despite being omnipotent. Among the most popular versions of the "greater good" response are appeals to the apologetics of free will. Theologians will argue that since no one can fully understand God's ultimate plan, no one can assume that evil actions do not have some sort of greater purpose. Therefore, they say nature of evil has a necessary role to play in God's plan for a better world.&lt;ref name=WhitneyTheodicy&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitney|first1=B|title=Theodicy|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=nysl_ce_colgul&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R1&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3407710979&amp;&amp;docId=GALE%7CCX3407710979&amp;docType=GALE|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library|publisher=Gale|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will====
{{main|Free will}}

The problem of evil is sometimes explained as a consequence of [[free will]], an ability granted by God.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"/&gt; Free will is both a source of good and of evil, and with free will also comes the potential for abuse, as when individuals act immorally. People with free will "decide to cause suffering and act in other evil ways", states Boyd, and it is they who make that choice, not God.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt; Further, the free will argument asserts that it would be logically inconsistent for God to prevent evil by coercion and curtailing free will, because that would no longer be free will.&lt;ref name=boydp69&gt;Gregory A. Boyd, ''Is God to Blame?'' (InterVarsity Press, 2003) {{ISBN|978-0830823949}}, pp. 55–58, 69–70, 76, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"/&gt;

Critics of the free will response have questioned whether it accounts for the degree of evil seen in this world. One point in this regard is that while the value of free will may be thought sufficient to counterbalance minor evils, it is less obvious that it outweighs the negative attributes of evils such as rape and murder. Particularly egregious cases known as horrendous evils, which "[constitute] [[prima facie]] reason to doubt whether the participant’s life could (given their inclusion in it) be a great good to him/her on the whole," have been the focus of recent work in the problem of evil.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marilyn McCord Adams]], ''Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God'' (Cornell University, 2000), 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Another point is that those actions of free beings which bring about evil very often diminish the freedom of those who suffer the evil; for example the murder of a young child prevents the child from ever exercising their free will. In such a case the freedom of an innocent child is pitted against the freedom of the evil-doer, it is not clear why God would remain unresponsive and passive.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marilyn McCord Adams]], ''Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God'' (Melbourne University Press, 1999), 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism is that the potential for evil inherent in free will may be limited by means which do not impinge on that free will. God could accomplish this by making moral actions especially pleasurable, or evil action and suffering impossible by allowing free will but not allowing the ability to enact evil or impose suffering.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis writes: "We can, perhaps, conceive of a world in which God corrected the results of this abuse of free will by His creatures at every moment: so that a wooden beam became soft as grass when it was used as a weapon, and the air refused to obey me if I attempted to set up in it the sound waves that carry lies or insults. But such a world would be one in which wrong actions were impossible, and in which, therefore, freedom of the will would be void; nay, if the principle were carried out to its logical conclusion, evil thoughts would be impossible, for the cerebral matter which we use in thinking would refuse its task when we attempted to frame them." C.S. Lewis ''[[The Problem of Pain]]'' (HarperCollins, 1996) pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the free will explanation state that that would no longer be free will.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"/&gt; Critics respond that this view seems to imply it would be similarly wrong to try to reduce suffering and evil in these ways, a position which few would advocate.&lt;ref&gt;''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', s.v. "The Problem of Evil," Michael Tooley at http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil/.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third challenge to the free will defence is [[natural evil]], which is the result of natural causes (e.g. a child suffering from a disease, mass casualties from a volcano).&lt;ref&gt;"The Two Types of Evil," at http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/god/chgoodandevilrev1.shtml. Accessed 10 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The "natural evil" criticism posits that even if for some reason an all-powerful and all-benevolent God tolerated evil human actions in order to allow free will, such a God would not be expected to also tolerate natural evils because they have no apparent connection to free will.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Lacewing|title=Philosophy for AS: Epistemology and Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EoA9BAAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-63583-3 |pages=239–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of the free will response to evil propose various explanations of natural evils. [[Alvin Plantinga]],&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=God, Freedom, and Evil |last=Plantinga |first=Alvin |year=1974 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=0-8028-1731-9 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Augustine of Hippo]],&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Plantinga, ''God, Freedom, and Evil'' (Eerdmans, 1989), 58.&lt;/ref&gt; and others have argued that natural evils are caused by the free choices of supernatural beings such as [[demon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley Hanson, ''Introduction to Christian Theology'' (Fortress, 1997), 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued
:• that natural evils are the result of the [[fall of man]], which corrupted the perfect world created by God&lt;ref&gt;Linda Edwards, ''A Brief Guide'' (Westminster John Knox, 2001), 62.&lt;/ref&gt; or
:• that natural evils are the result of [[natural laws]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Polkinghorne | first = John | authorlink = John Polkinghorne | title = Belief in God in an Age of Science | publisher=Yale Nota Bene | year = 2003 | location = New Haven, CT | page = 14 | isbn = 978-0-300-09949-2 }} and also See esp. ch. 5 of his ''Science and Providence''. {{ISBN|978-0-87773-490-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or
:• that natural evils provide us with a knowledge of evil which makes our free choices more significant than they would otherwise be, and so our free will more valuable&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Swinburne]] in "Is There a God?" writes that "the operation of natural laws producing evils gives humans knowledge (if they choose to seek it) of how to bring about such evils themselves. Observing you can catch some disease by the operation of natural processes gives me the power either to use those processes to give that disease to other people, or through negligence to allow others to catch it, or to take measures to prevent others from catching the disease." In this way, "it increases the range of significant choice... The actions which natural evil makes possible are ones which allow us to perform at our best and interact with our fellows at the deepest level" (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996) 108–09.&lt;/ref&gt; or
:• that natural evils are a mechanism of divine punishment for moral evils that humans have committed, and so the natural evil is justified.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley Hanson, ''Introduction to Christian Theology'' (Fortress, 1997), 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars agree that Plantinga's free will of human and non-human spirits (demons) argument successfully solves the logical problem of evil, proving that God and evil are logically compatible&lt;ref name=meisterp134&gt;{{cite book |title=Introducing Philosophy of Religion |last=Meister |first=Chad |year=2009 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-40327-8 |page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other scholars explicitly dissent.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, J.H. Logic and Theism. Cambridge University Press (2004) pp. 436–37&lt;/ref&gt; The dissenters state that while explaining infectious diseases, cancer, hurricanes and other nature-caused suffering as something that is caused by the free will of supernatural beings solves the logical version of the problem of evil, it is highly unlikely that these natural evils do not have natural causes that an omnipotent God could prevent, but instead are caused by the immoral actions of supernatural beings with free will whom God created.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; According to Michael Tooley, this defense is also highly implausible because suffering from natural evil is localized, rational causes and cures for major diseases have been found, and it is unclear why anyone, including a supernatural being whom God created would choose to inflict localized evil and suffering to innocent children for example, and why God fails to stop such suffering if he is omnipotent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alvin Plantinga|author2=Michael Tooley|title=Knowledge of God|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3xfjbwDoPj8C |year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-0131-1 |pages=101–05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Free will and animal suffering
One of the weaknesses of the free will defense is its inapplicability or contradictory applicability with respect to evils faced by animals and the consequent animal suffering. Some scholars, such as [[David Ray Griffin|David Griffin]], state that the free will, or the assumption of greater good through free will, does not apply to animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Ray Griffin|title=Evil Revisited: Responses and Reconsiderations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1NMm1lXb4SgC |year=1991|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0612-0 |pages=94–95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John S.

The "free creatures" defense has also been criticized, in the case of caged, domesticated and farmed animals who are not free and many of whom have historically experienced evil and suffering from abuse by their owners. Further, even animals and living creatures in the wild face horrendous evils and suffering—such as burn and slow death after natural fires or other natural disasters or from predatory injuries—and it is unclear, state Bishop and Perszyk, why an all-loving God would create such free creatures prone to intense suffering.&lt;ref name="Nicola Hoggard Creegan 2013 48"/&gt; 

; Heaven and free will

There is also debate regarding the compatibility of moral free will (to select good or evil action) with the absence of evil from heaven,&lt;ref&gt;Oppy, Graham. ''Arguing about Gods'', pp. 314–39. Cambridge University Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0521863864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.svri.org/evil.pdf#page=72 |title=Evil, Freedom and the Heaven Dilemma |author=Simon Cushing |year=2010 |work=Challenging Evil: Time, Society and Changing Concepts of the Meaning of Evil |publisher=Inter-Disciplinary Press |deadurl=yes |accessdate=10 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517181511/http://www.svri.org/evil.pdf#page=72 |archivedate=17 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with God's omniscience and with his omnibenevolence.&lt;ref name="IepLogical" /&gt;

One line of extended criticism of free will defense has been that if God is perfectly powerful, knowing and loving, then he could have actualized a world with free creatures without moral evil where everyone chooses good, is always full of loving-kindness, is compassionate, always non-violent and full of joy, where earth were just like the monotheistic concept of [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]]. If God did create a heaven with his love, an all-loving and always-loving God could have created an earth without evil and suffering for animals and human beings just like heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan|title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB1pAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-993185-9|pages=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Process theodicy====
"Process theodicy reframes the debate on the problem of evil by denying one of its key premises: divine omnipotence."&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|143}}  It integrates philosophical and theological commitments while shifting theological metaphors.  For example, God becomes the Great Companion and Fellow-Sufferer where the future is realized hand-in-hand with the sufferer.&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|143}}

===Soul-making or Irenaean theodicy===
{{main|Irenaean theodicy}}

The soul-making or Irenaean theodicy is named after the 2nd-century Greek theologian [[Irenaeus]], whose ideas were adopted in Eastern Christianity.&lt;ref name=johnhickp201/&gt; It has been discussed by [[John Hick]], and the Irenaean theodicy asserts that evil and [[suffering]] are necessary for spiritual growth, for man to discover his soul, and God allows evil for spiritual growth of human beings.&lt;ref name=johnhickp201&gt;{{cite book|author=John Hick|title=Evil and the God of Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMcYDAAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-349-18048-6 |pages=201–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irenaean theodicy has been challenged with the assertion that many evils do not seem to promote spiritual growth, and can be positively destructive of the human spirit. Hick acknowledges that this process often fails in our world.&lt;ref&gt;John Hick, ''Evil and the God of Love '', (Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition 1977, 2010 reissue), 325, 336.&lt;/ref&gt; A second issue concerns the distribution of evils suffered: were it true that God permitted evil in order to facilitate spiritual growth, then we would expect evil to disproportionately befall those in poor spiritual health. This does not seem to be the case, as the decadent enjoy lives of luxury which insulate them from evil, whereas many of the pious are poor, and are well acquainted with worldly evils.&lt;ref&gt;The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "The Problem of Evil", James R. Beebe&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly, states Kane, human character can be developed directly or in constructive and nurturing loving ways, and it is unclear why God would consider or allow evil and suffering to be necessary or the preferred way to spiritual growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Hick|title=Evil and the God of Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMcYDAAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-349-18048-6 |pages=376–79 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, horrendous suffering often leads to dehumanization, its victims in truth do not grow spiritually but become vindictive and spiritually worse.&lt;ref name=Creeganp185/&gt;

This reconciliation of the problem of evil and God, states Creegan, also fails to explain the need or rationale for evil inflicted on animals and resultant animal suffering, because "there is no evidence at all that suffering improves the character of animals, or is evidence of soul-making in them".&lt;ref name=Creeganp185&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan |title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWSL-zZ5x4QC |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-993184-2 |page=185 with footnote 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a more fundamental level, the soul-making theodicy assumes that the virtues developed through suffering are intrinsically, as opposed to instrumentally, good. The virtues identified as "soul-making" only appear to be valuable in a world where evil and suffering already exist. A willingness to sacrifice oneself in order to save others from persecution, for example, is virtuous precisely because persecution exists. Likewise, we value the willingness to donate one's meal to those who are starving because starvation exists. If persecution and starvation did not occur, there would be no reason to consider these acts virtuous. If the virtues developed through soul-making are only valuable where suffering exists, then it is not clear that we would lose anything if suffering did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rationalrealm.com/downloads/philosophy/ProblemOfEvil.pdf|website=Rational Realm|title=The Problem of Evil|first=Leslie|last=Allan|date=28 July 2015|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cruciform theodicy====
Soul-making theodicy and Process theodicy are full theodical systems with distinctive cosmologies, theologies and perspectives on the problem of evil; cruciform theodicy is not a system but is a thematic trajectory within them.  As a result, it does not address all the questions of "the origin, nature, problem, reason and end of evil,"&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|145}} but it does represent an important change. "On July 16, 1944 awaiting execution in a [[Nazi]] prison and reflecting on Christ's experience of powerlessness and pain, [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] penned six words that became the clarion call for the modern theological paradigm shift: 'Only the suffering God can help."&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|146}}  Classic theism includes "impassability" (God cannot suffer personally) as a necessary characteristic of God. Cruciform theodicy begins with Jesus' suffering "the entire spectrum of human sorrow, including economic exploitation, political disenfranchisement, social ostracism, rejection and betrayal by friends, even alienation from his own family...deep psychological distress... [grief]..." ridicule, humiliation, abandonment, beating, torture, despair, and death.&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|146,148}}

Theologian [[Jürgen Moltmann]] asserts the "passibility" of God saying "A God who cannot suffer cannot love."&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|150}} Philosopher and Christian priest [[Marilyn McCord Adams]] offers a theodicy of "redemptive suffering" which proposes that innocent suffering shows the "transformative power of redemption" rather than that God is not omnibenevolent.&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|158–168}}

===Afterlife===
[[Thomas Aquinas]] suggested the [[afterlife]] theodicy to address the problem of evil and to justifying the existence of evil.&lt;ref name="stump2008p49"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wDHCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49 | title=The Evidential Argument from Evil | publisher=Indiana University Press | author=Eleonore Stump | editor=Daniel Howard-Snyder | year=2008 | pages=49–52 | isbn=0-253-11409-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premise behind this theodicy is that the afterlife is unending, human life is short, and God allows evil and suffering in order to judge and grant everlasting heaven or hell based on human moral actions and human suffering.&lt;ref name=stump2008p49/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goetz2008p139"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Benjamin W. McCraw|author2=Robert Arp|title=The Problem of Evil: New Philosophical Directions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oUA1CwAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Lexington|isbn=978-1-4985-1208-4 |pages=132–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas says that the afterlife is the greater good that justifies the evil and suffering in current life.&lt;ref name=stump2008p49/&gt; Christian author [[Randy Alcorn]] argues that the joys of [[heaven]] will compensate for the sufferings on earth.&lt;ref&gt;If God Is Good: Faith in the Midst of Suffering and Evil, published by Random House of Canada, 2009, p. 294; Quote: Without this eternal perspective, we assume that people who die young, who have handicaps, who suffer poor health, who don't get married or have children, or who don't do this or that will miss out on the best life has to offer.  But the theology underlying these assumptions have a fatal flaw.  It presumes that our present Earth, bodies, culture, relationships and lives are all there is... [but] Heaven will bring far more than compensation for our present sufferings.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Maitzen has called this the "Heaven Swamps Everything" theodicy, and argues that it is false because it conflates compensation and justification.&lt;ref name="Goetz2008p139"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stewart Goetz|title=Freedom, Teleology, and Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cZmvAwAAQBAJ |year=2008|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-7183-2 |pages=139–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.acadiau.ca/tl_files/sites/philosophy/resources/documents/Maitzen_OMIA.pdf "Ordinary Morality Implies Atheism"], European Journal for Philosophy of Religion 1:2 (2009), 107–26, Quote: "... may stem from imagining an ecstatic or forgiving state of mind on the part of the blissful: in heaven no one bears grudges, even the most horrific earthly suffering is as nothing compared to infinite bliss, all past wrongs are forgiven. But "are forgiven" doesn’t mean "were justified"; the blissful person’s disinclination to dwell on his or her earthly suffering doesn’t imply that a perfect being was justified in permitting the suffering all along. By the same token, our ordinary moral practice recognizes a legitimate complaint about child abuse even if, as adults, its victims should happen to be on drugs that make them uninterested in complaining. Even if heaven swamps everything, it doesn’t thereby justify everything."&lt;/ref&gt;

A second objection to the afterlife theodicy is that it does not reconcile the suffering of small babies and innocent children from diseases, abuse, and injury in war or terror attacks, since "human moral actions" are not to be expected from babies and uneducated/mentored children.&lt;ref name=jolley2014p66/&gt; Similarly, moral actions and the concept of choice do not apply to the problem of evil applied to animal suffering caused by natural evil or the actions of human beings.&lt;ref name=jolley2014p66&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Jolley|editor=Larry M. Jorgensen and Samuel Newlands|title=New Essays on Leibniz's Theodicy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lNPQAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-966003-2 |pages=64–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Chignell|author2=Terence Cuneo|author3=Matthew C.

===Deny evil exists===
In the second century, Christian theologists attempted to reconcile the problem of evil with an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent God, by denying that evil exists. Among these theologians, [[Clement of Alexandria]] offered several theodicies, of which one was called "privation theory of evil" which was adopted thereafter.&lt;ref name="Kelly2002p42"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Francis Kelly|title=The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rg2RJAIZ4k4C&amp;pg=PA42 |year=2002|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-5104-9 |page=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is a more modern version of "deny evil", suggested by Christian Science, wherein the perception of evil is described as a form of illusion.&lt;ref name="Millard J. Erickson 2007, page 445-446"/&gt;

====Evil as the absence of good (privation theory)====
{{Main|Absence of good}}

The early version of "deny evil" is called the "privation theory of evil", so named because it described evil as a form of "lack, loss or privation". One of the earliest proponents of this theory was the 2nd-century Clement of Alexandria, who according to Joseph Kelly,&lt;ref name="Kelly2002p42"/&gt; stated that "since God is completely good, he could not have created evil; but if God did not create evil, then it cannot exist". Evil, according to Clement, does not exist as a positive, but exists as a negative or as a "lack of good".&lt;ref name="Kelly2002p42"/&gt; Clement's idea was criticised for its inability to explain suffering in the world, if evil did not exist. He was also pressed by Gnostics scholars with the question as to why God did not create creatures that "did not lack the good". Clement attempted to answer these questions ontologically through dualism, an idea found in the Platonic school,&lt;ref name=jeffrey49&gt;{{cite book|author=R. Jeffery |title=Evil and International Relations: Human Suffering in an Age of Terror |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WyADAAAQBAJ |year=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-0-230-61035-4 |page=49 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is by presenting two realities, one of God and Truth, another of human and perceived experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Francis Kelly|title=The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rg2RJAIZ4k4C&amp;pg=PA42 |year=2002|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-5104-9 |pages=42–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth-century theologian [[Augustine of Hippo]] adopted the privation theory, and in his ''Enchiridion on Faith, Hope and Love'', maintained that evil exists only as "absence of the good", that vices are nothing but the privations of natural good.&lt;ref name=jeffrey49/&gt; Evil is not a substance, states Augustine, it is nothing more than "loss of good".&lt;ref name="Pereira2013p54"/&gt; God does not participate in evil, God is perfection, His creation is perfection, stated Augustine.&lt;ref name="Pereira2013p54"/&gt; According to the privation theory, it is the absence of the good, that explains sin and moral evil.&lt;ref name="Pereira2013p54"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jairzinho Lopes Pereira |title=Augustine of Hippo and Martin Luther on Original Sin and Justification of the Sinner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iVcAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |isbn=978-3-647-55063-3 |pages=54–55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view has been criticized as merely substituting definition, of evil with "loss of good", of "problem of evil and suffering" with the "problem of loss of good and suffering", but it neither addresses the issue from the theoretical point of view nor from the experiential point of view.&lt;ref name=pereira2013p56&gt;{{cite book|author=Jairzinho Lopes Pereira |title=Augustine of Hippo and Martin Luther on Original Sin and Justification of the Sinner |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iVcAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |isbn=978-3-647-55063-3 |page=56 with footnote 25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars who criticize the privation theory state that murder, rape, terror, pain and suffering are real life events for the victim, and cannot be denied as mere "lack of good".&lt;ref&gt;Todd C. Calder (2007), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20464387 Is the Privation Theory of Evil Dead?], American Philosophical Quarterly, Vol. 44, No. 4, pp. 371–81&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine, states Pereira, accepted suffering exists and was aware that the privation theory was not a solution to the problem of evil.&lt;ref name=pereira2013p56/&gt;

====Evil as illusory====
An alternative modern version of the privation theory is by [[Christian Science]], which asserts that evils such as suffering and disease only appear to be real, but in truth are illusions, and in reality evil does not exist.&lt;ref name="Millard J. Erickson 2007, page 445-446"&gt;Millard J. Erickson, Christian Theology, Second Edition, Baker Academic, 2007, pp. 445–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The theologists of Christian Science, states Stephen Gottschalk, posit that the Spirit is of infinite might, mortal human beings fail to grasp this and focus instead on evil and suffering that have no real existence as "a power, person or principle opposed to God".&lt;ref name= Gottschalkp65&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Gottschalk |title=Christian Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r-FYQv75w7kC |year=1978|publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-03718-2|pages=65–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The illusion version of privation theory theodicy has been critiqued for denying the reality of crimes, wars, terror, sickness, injury, death, suffering and pain to the victim.&lt;ref name= Gottschalkp65/&gt; Further, adds Millard Erickson, the illusion argument merely shifts the problem to a new problem, as to why God would create this "illusion" of crimes, wars, terror, sickness, injury, death, suffering and pain; and why God does not stop this "illusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Millard J. Erickson|title=Christian Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Z5zBQAAQBAJ |year=1998|publisher=Baker Academic|isbn=978-0-8010-2182-4 |pages=446–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turning the tables===
A different approach to the problem of evil is to turn the tables by suggesting that any argument from evil is self-refuting, in that its conclusion would necessitate the falsity of one of its premises. One response—called the defensive response&lt;ref name=russell625/&gt;—has been to assert the opposite, and to point out that the assertion "evil exists" implies an ethical standard against which moral value is determined, and then to argue that this standard implies the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis ''Mere Christianity'' Touchstone:New York, 1980 pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard criticism of this view is that an argument from evil is not necessarily a presentation of the views of its proponent, but is instead intended to show how premises which the theist is inclined to believe lead him or her to the conclusion that God does not exist. A second criticism is that the existence of evil can be inferred from the suffering of its victims, rather than by the actions of the evil actor, so no "ethical standard" is implied.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Oppy (2006), ''Arguing about Gods'', pp. 17, 296. Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521863864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Howard-Snyder|title=The Evidential Argument from Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wDHCgAAQBAJ |year=2008|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-11409-8 |pages= 305–06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument was expounded upon by David Hume.&lt;ref name=russell625&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Russell| title=The Oxford Handbook of Hume|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IMLmCwAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-974284-4 |pages=625–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hidden reasons===
A variant of above defenses is that the problem of evil is derived from probability judgments since they rest on the claim that, even after careful reflection, one can see no good reason for co-existence of God and of evil. The [[inference]] from this claim to the general statement that there exists unnecessary evil is [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] in nature and it is this inductive step that sets the evidential argument apart from the logical argument.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;

The hidden reasons defense asserts that there exists the logical possibility of hidden or unknown reasons for the existence of evil along with the existence of an almighty, all-knowing, all-benevolent, all-powerful God. Not knowing the reason does not necessarily mean that the reason does not exist.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt; This argument has been challenged with the assertion that the hidden reasons premise is as plausible as the premise that God does not exist or is not "an almighty, all-knowing, all-benevolent, all-powerful". Similarly, for every hidden argument that completely or partially justifies observed evils it is equally likely that there is a hidden argument that actually makes the observed evils worse than they appear without hidden arguments, or that the hidden reasons may result in additional contradictions.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frances2013p110"/&gt; As such, from an inductive viewpoint hidden arguments will neutralize one another.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;

A sub-variant of the "hidden reasons" defense is called the "PHOG"—profoundly hidden outweighing goods—defense.&lt;ref name="Frances2013p110"/&gt; The PHOG defense, states Bryan Frances, not only leaves the co-existence of God and human suffering unanswered, but raises questions about why animals and other life forms have to suffer from natural evil, or from abuse (animal slaughter, animal cruelty) by some human beings, where hidden moral lessons, hidden social good and such hidden reasons to reconcile God with the problem of evil do not apply.&lt;ref name="Frances2013p110"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryan Frances |title=Gratuitous Suffering and the Problem of Evil: A Comprehensive Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ngeIkSJnh4kC&amp;pg=PA110|date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-66295-6 |pages=110–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Previous lives and karma===
The theory of [[karma]] refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/312474/karma Karma] Encyclopædia Britannica (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of evil, in the context of karma, has been long discussed in Indian religions including Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, both in its theistic and non-theistic schools; for example, in Uttara Mīmāṃsā Sutras Book 2 Chapter 1;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney (2005), in The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism (Editor: [[Gavin Flood]]), Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|0631215352}}, pp. 454–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney (1989), ‘‘Evil, Divine Omnipotence and Human Freedom: Vedanta’s theology of Karma, Journal of Religion, Vol. 69, pp 530–48&lt;/ref&gt; the 8th-century arguments by Adi Sankara in ''Brahmasutrabhasya'' where he posits that God cannot reasonably be the cause of the world because there exists moral evil, inequality, cruelty and suffering in the world;&lt;ref name=bilimoria&gt;P.

Many Indian religions place greater emphasis on developing the karma principle for first cause and innate justice with Man as focus, rather than developing religious principles with the nature and powers of God and divine judgment as focus.&lt;ref&gt;B. Reichenbach (1998), Karma and the Problem of Evil, in Philosophy of Religion Toward a Global Perspective (Editor: G.E. Kessler), Wadsworth, {{ISBN|978-0534505493}}, pp. 248–55&lt;/ref&gt; Karma theory of Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism is not static, but dynamic wherein livings beings with intent or without intent, but with words and actions continuously create new karma, and it is this that they believe to be in part the source of good or evil in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yuvraj Krishan |title=The Doctrine of Karma: Its Origin and Development in Brāhmaṇical, Buddhist, and Jaina Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC |year=1997|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan |isbn=978-81-208-1233-8 |pages=17–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These religions also believe that past lives or past actions in current life create current circumstances, which also contributes to either. Other scholars&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Sharma (1973), Theodicy and the doctrine of karma, ‘‘Man’’, Vol. 8, No. 3, pp. 347–64&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that nontheistic Indian religious traditions do not assume an omnibenevolent creator, and some&lt;ref&gt;The Nyaya-Vaisesika school of Hinduism is one of the exceptions where the premise is similar to the Christian concept of an omnibenevolent, omnipotent creator&lt;/ref&gt; theistic schools do not define or characterize their god(s) as monotheistic Western religions do and the deities have colorful, complex personalities; the Indian deities are personal and cosmic facilitators, and in some schools conceptualized like Plato’s [[Demiurge]].&lt;ref name=bilimoria2013&gt;P.

===Pandeism===
[[Pandeism]] is a modern theory that unites deism and pantheism, and asserts that God created the universe but during creation became the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Deism#ref1042352 Deism], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; In pandeism, God is no superintending, heavenly power, capable of hourly intervention into earthly affairs. No longer existing "above," God ''cannot'' intervene from above and cannot be blamed for failing to do so. God, in pandeism, was omnipotent and omnibenevolent, but in the form of universe is no longer omnipotent, omnibenevolent.&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lane | first = William C. | date = January 2010 |title = Leibniz's Best World Claim Restructured | url = http://apq.press.illinois.edu/47/1/lane.html | journal = American Philosophical Journal | publisher = | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–84 |accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|76–77}}

====The Bible====
Sociologist [[Walter Brueggemann]] says theodicy is "a constant concern of the entire Bible" and needs to "include the category of social evil as well as moral, natural (physical) and religious evil".&lt;ref name="Anthony J.Tambasco"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Tambasco|editor1-first=Anthony J.|title=The Bible on Suffering: Social and Political Implications|date=2001|publisher=Paulist Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8091-4048-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}}  There is general agreement among Bible scholars that the Bible "does not admit of a singular perspective on evil. ...Instead we encounter a variety of perspectives...  Consequently [the Bible focuses on] moral and spiritual remedies, not rational or logical [justifications].  ...It is simply that the Bible operates within a cosmic, moral and spiritual landscape rather than within a rationalist, abstract, ontological landscape."&lt;ref name="Mark S.

Philosopher [[Richard Swinburne]] says that, as it stands in its classic form, the argument from evil is unanswerable, yet there may be contrary reasons for not reaching its conclusion that there is no God.&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne, Richard. (1998). ''Providence and the Problem of Evil''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; These reasons are of three kinds: other strong reasons for affirming that there is a God; general reasons for doubting the force of the argument itself; and specific reasons for doubting the criteria of any of the argument's premises; "in other words, a theodicy."&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne, Richard. (1998). ''Providence and the Problem of Evil''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Christianity has responded with multiple traditional theodicies: the Punishment theodicy (Augustine), the Soul-making theodicy (Irenaeus), Process theodicy (Rabbi Harold Kushner), Cruciform theodicy (Moltmann), and the free-will defense (Plantinga) among them.&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;

There are, essentially, four representations of evil in the Bible: chaos, human sin, Satanic/demonic forces, and suffering.&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|14}} The biblical language of chaos and chaos monsters such as Leviathan remind us order and harmony in our world are constantly assailed by forces "inimical to God's good creation."&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|17}} The Bible primarily speaks of sin as moral evil rather than natural or metaphysical evil with an accent on the breaking of God's moral laws, his covenant, the teachings of Christ and the injunctions of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name="Mark S.

While the post-Enlightenment world does not, the "dark spiritual forces" can be seen as "symbols of the darkest recesses of human nature."&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|25,28}} Suffering and misfortune are sometimes represented as evil in the Bible, though theologian Brian Han Gregg says, suffering in the Bible is represented twelve different ways.&lt;ref name="Mark S.

*Deuteronomy 30 and Hebrews 12 open the possibilities that suffering may be punishment, natural consequences, or God's loving discipline. 
*Genesis 4:1-8 and the first murder suggests much suffering is the result of certain people's choices. 
*Genesis 45 says God's redemptive power is stronger than suffering and can be used to further good purposes. 
*Luke 22:31-34 says resist the fear and despair that accompany suffering, instead remember/believe God has the power to help. 
*Job 40 says God is not like humans but wants a relationship with all of them, which requires some surrender to God and acceptance of suffering.
*Romans 8:18-30 sets present temporary suffering within the context of God's eternal purposes. 
*Hebrews 12:1-6 sets suffering within the concept of "soul-making" as do 2 Peter 1:5-8, James 1, and others. 
*Exodus 17:1-7 and the whole book of Job characterize suffering as testing and speak of God's right to test human loyalty. 
*2 Corinthians 4:7-12 says human weakness during suffering reveals God's strength and that it is part of the believer's calling to embrace suffering in solidarity with Christ. 
*2 Corinthians 1:3-7 says God is the comforter and that people learn how to better comfort others when they have personal experience of suffering.  
*The great hymn in Philippians 2, along with Colossians 1:24, combine to claim Christ redeems suffering itself.  Believers are invited to share in that by emulating his good thoughts, words and deeds. All New Testament teachings on suffering are all grounded in and circle back to the fall of mankind and the possible redemptive power to individuals of the cross.&lt;ref name="Brian Han Gregg"/&gt;{{rp|160,161}}

Jewish theodicy is experiencing extensive revision in light of the Holocaust while still asserting the difference between the human and divine perspective of evil. It remains rooted in the nature of creation itself and the limitation inherent in matter's capacity to be perfected; the action of freewill includes the potential for perfection from individual effort and leaves evil in human hands.&lt;ref name="Oliver Leaman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leaman|first1=Oliver|title=Evil and Suffering in Jewish Philosophy|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-521-41724-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|70}}

In the Bible, all characterizations of evil and suffering reveal "a God who is greater than suffering [who] is powerful, creative and committed to His creation [who] always has the last word."  God's commitment to the greater good is assumed in all cases.&lt;ref name="Brian Han Gregg"/&gt;{{rp|162,168}}

====Judgment Day====
John Joseph Haldane's Wittgenstinian-Thomistic account of concept formation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haldane|first1=J.J.|title=Atheism and Theism|date=2003|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=0-631-23259-1|pages=102–05|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Martin Heidegger's observation of temporality's thrown nature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidegger|first1=Martin|title=Being and Time|origyear=1962|year=2003|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=0-631-19770-2|pages=426–27 (H 374) 458–72 (H 406–21)}}&lt;/ref&gt; imply that God's act of creation and God's act of judgment are the same act. God's condemnation of evil is subsequently believed to be executed and expressed in his created world; a judgement that is unstoppable due to God's all powerful will; a constant and eternal judgement that becomes announced and communicated to other people on [[Judgment Day]]. In this explanation, God's condemnation of evil is declared to be a good judgement.

====Irenaean theodicy====
[[Irenaean theodicy]], posited by [[Irenaeus]] (2nd century CE–c. 202), has been reformulated by [[John Hick]]. It holds that one cannot achieve moral goodness or love for God if there is no evil and suffering in the world. Evil is [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]-making and leads one to be truly moral and close to God. God created an [[epistemic]] distance (such that God is not immediately knowable) so that we may strive to know him and by doing so become truly good. Evil is a means to good for three main reasons:

# ''Means of knowledge'' – Hunger leads to pain, and causes a desire to feed. Knowledge of pain prompts humans to seek to help others in pain.
# ''Character building'' – Evil offers the opportunity to grow morally. "We would never learn the art of goodness in a world designed as a hedonistic paradise" (''Richard Swinburne'')
# ''Predictable environment'' – The world runs to a series of natural laws. These are independent of any inhabitants of the universe. Natural Evil only occurs when these natural laws conflict with our own perceived needs. This is not immoral in any way

====Augustinian theodicy====
St [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430 CE) in his [[Augustinian theodicy]], as presented in John Hick's book ''Evil and the God of Love'', focuses on the Genesis story that essentially dictates that God created the world and that it was good; evil is merely a consequence of [[the fall of man]] (The story of the Garden of Eden where Adam and Eve disobeyed God and caused inherent sin for man). Augustine stated that [[natural evil]] (evil present in the natural world such as natural disasters etc.) is caused by fallen angels, whereas [[moral evil]] (evil caused by the will of human beings) is as a result of man having become estranged from God and choosing to deviate from his chosen path. Augustine argued that God could not have created evil in the world, as it was created good, and that all notions of evil are simply a deviation or privation of goodness. Evil cannot be a separate and unique substance. For example, Blindness is not a separate entity, but is merely a lack or privation of sight. Thus the Augustinian theodicist would argue that the problem of evil and suffering is void because God did not create evil; it was man who chose to deviate from the path of perfect goodness.

====St. Thomas Aquinas====
Saint Thomas systematized the Augustinian conception of evil, supplementing it with his own musings. Evil, according to St. Thomas, is a privation, or the absence of some good which belongs properly to the nature of the creature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://josephkenny.joyeurs.com/CDtexts/ContraGentiles3a.htm#7 ''Summa Contra Gentiles'' III c. 7]&lt;/ref&gt; There is therefore no positive source of evil, corresponding to the greater good, which is God;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1049.htm#article3|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The cause of evil (Prima Pars, Q. 49)|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; evil being not real but rational—i.e. it exists not as an objective fact, but as a subjective conception; things are evil not in themselves, but by reason of their relation to other things or persons. All realities are in themselves good; they produce bad results only incidentally; and consequently the ultimate cause of evil is fundamentally good, as well as the objects in which evil is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1049.htm#article1|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The cause of evil (Prima Pars, Q. 49)|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Luther and Calvin ====
{{main|Original sin}}
Both [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and [[John Calvin|Calvin]] explained evil as a consequence of the [[fall of man]] and the [[original sin]]. Calvin, however, held to the belief in [[predestination]] and omnipotence, the fall is part of God's plan. Luther saw evil and original sin as an inheritance from Adam and Eve, passed on to all mankind from their conception and bound the will of man to serving sin, which God's just nature allowed as consequence for their distrust, though God planned mankind's redemption through [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Bondage of the Will|last=Luther|first=Martin|publisher=|year=1525|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately humans may not be able to understand and explain this plan.&lt;ref&gt;The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition: From the Book of Job to Modern Genetics, Joseph F. Kelly, p. 94–96&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Liberal Christianity ====
Some modern [[liberal Christianity|liberal Christians]], including French Calvinist theologian André Gounelle and Pastor Marc Pernot of [[L'Oratoire du Louvre]], believe that God is not omnipotent, and that the Bible only describes God as "almighty" in passages concerning the [[End Times]].&lt;ref name="andregounelle.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andregounelle.fr/dieu/quelle-puissance-l-impossible-toute-puissance.php|title=Quelle puissance ?|website=andregounelle.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oratoiredulouvre.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oratoiredulouvre.fr/dictionnaire/puissant-tout-puissant.php|title=Puissant - Tout-Puissant - Oratoire du Louvre|first=|last=Stereoweb|date=1 July 2018|website=Oratoire du Louvre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christian Science====
{{see also|Christian Science#Evil}}
[[Christian Science]] views evil as having no ultimate reality and as being due to false beliefs, consciously or unconsciously held. Evils such as illness and death may be banished by correct understanding. This view has been questioned, aside from the general criticisms of the concept of evil as an illusion discussed earlier, since the presumably correct understanding by Christian Science members, including the founder, has not prevented illness and death.&lt;ref name="Millard J. Erickson 2007, page 445-446"/&gt; However, Christian Scientists believe that the many instances of spiritual healing (as recounted e.g. in the Christian Science periodicals and in the textbook Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy) are [[anecdotal evidence]] of the correctness of the teaching of the unreality of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Peel, 1987, Spiritual Healing in a Scientific Age, San Francisco, Harper and Row, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; According to one author, the denial by Christian Scientists that evil ultimately exists neatly solves the problem of evil; however, most people cannot accept that solution&lt;ref&gt;Ben Dupre, "The Problem of Evil," 50 Philosophy Ideas You Really Need to Know, London, Quercus, 2007, p. 166: "Denying that there is ultimately any such thing as evil, as advocated by Christian Scientists, solves the problem at a stroke, but such a remedy is too hard for most to swallow."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe that [[Satan]] is the original cause of evil.&lt;ref&gt;"Why All Suffering Is Soon to End", ''The Watchtower'', 15 May 2007, p. 21, "For some, the obstacle [to believing in God] involves what is often called the ''problem of evil''. They feel that if God exists and is almighty and loving, the evil and suffering in the world cannot be explained. No God who tolerates evil could exist, they reason... Satan has surely proved adept at blinding human minds. ...God is not responsible for the wickedness so prevalent in the world." [emphasis added] [http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2007366]&lt;/ref&gt; Though once a perfect angel, Satan developed feelings of self-importance and craved worship, and eventually challenged God's right to rule. Satan caused [[Adam and Eve]] to disobey God, and humanity subsequently became participants in a challenge involving the competing claims of Jehovah and Satan to universal sovereignty.&lt;ref name="pentonsatan"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Penton | first = M.J. | title = Apocalypse Delayed | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 1997 | pages = 189–90 | isbn = 9780802079732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other angels who sided with Satan became [[demon]]s.

God's subsequent tolerance of evil is explained in part by the value of free will. But Jehovah's Witnesses also hold that this period of suffering is one of non-interference from God, which serves to demonstrate that [[Jehovah]]'s "right to rule" is both correct and in the best interests of all intelligent beings, settling the "issue of universal sovereignty". Further, it gives individual humans the opportunity to show their willingness to submit to God's rulership.

At some future time known to him, God will consider his right to universal sovereignty to have been settled for all time. The [[Justification (theology)|reconciliation of "faithful" humankind]] will have been accomplished through [[Christ]], and nonconforming humans and demons will have been destroyed. Thereafter, evil (any failure to submit to God's rulership) will be summarily executed.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Does God Allow Evil and Suffering?", ''The Watchtower'', 1 May 2011, p. 16, [http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2011331]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/g201107/why-so-much-suffering/ "Why Is There So Much Suffering?", ''Awake'', July 2011, p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ====
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) introduces a concept similar to [[Problem of evil#Irenaean theodicy|Irenaean theodicy]], that experiencing evil is a necessary part of the development of the soul. Specifically, the laws of nature prevent an individual from fully comprehending or experiencing good without experiencing its opposite.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Mormon]], [[Second Book of Nephi|2 Nephi]] {{lds||2-ne|2|11|13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, Latter-day Saints do not regard [[fall of man|the fall]] of [[Adam and Eve (LDS Church)|Adam and Eve]] as a tragic, unplanned cancellation of an eternal paradise; rather they see it as an essential element of God's plan. By allowing opposition and temptations in mortality, God created an environment for people to learn, to develop their freedom to choose, and to appreciate and understand the light, with a comparison to darkness &lt;ref name="MyUser_Https:_December_27_2015c1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-4-freedom-to-choose?lang=eng |title=Gospel Principles Chapter 4: Freedom to Choose |newspaper= |date=  |author= |accessdate= 27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Doctrines of the Gospel, Student Manual |year= 2000 |chapter= Chapter 10: The Purpose of Earth Life |chapter-url= https://www.lds.org/manual/doctrines-of-the-gospel-student-manual/chapter-10-the-purpose-of-earth-life?lang=eng |publisher= [[Institute of Religion|Institutes of Religion]], [[Church Educational System]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a departure from the mainstream Christian definition of [[omnipotence]] and [[omniscience]], which Mormons believe was changed by post-apostolic theologians in the centuries after Christ. The writings of [[Justin Martyr]], [[Origen]], [[Augustine]], and others indicate a merging of Christian principles with Greek metaphysical philosophies such as [[Neoplatonism]], which described divinity as an [[divine simplicity|utterly simple]], immaterial, formless substance/essence ([[ousia]]) that was the absolute causality and creative source of all that existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Bickmore |first= Barry R. |authorlink= Barry R.

==Other religions==
===Ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt===
The [[ancient Egypt]]ian religion, according to {{proper name|Roland Enmarch}}, potentially absolved their gods from any blame for evil, and used a negative cosmology and the negative concept of human nature to explain evil.&lt;ref name=enmarch2&gt;Roland Enmarch (2008), [http://digital2.library.ucla.edu/viewFile.do?contentFileId=1700601 Theodicy], UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology, Editors: Dieleman and Wendrich&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the Pharaoh was seen as an agent of the gods and his actions as a king were aimed to prevent evil and curb evilness in human nature.&lt;ref name=enmarch2/&gt;

===Ancient Greek religion===
The gods in [[Ancient Greek religion]] were seen as superior, but shared similar traits with humans and often interacted with them.&lt;ref name=Homer&gt;{{cite book|last1=Homer|title=The Iliad|date=1990|publisher=Penguin Books|location=NewYork}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Greeks didn't believe in any "evil" gods, the Greeks still acknowledged the fact that evil was present in the world.&lt;ref name="Greek/Gods"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kirby|first1=John|title=Gods and Goddesses|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=nysl_ce_colgul&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R7&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=2&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3035100157&amp;&amp;docId=GALE%7cCX3035100157&amp;docType=GALE|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gods often meddled in the affairs of men, and sometimes their actions consisted of bringing misery to people, for example gods would sometimes be a direct cause of death for people.&lt;ref name="Homer"/&gt; However, the Greeks did not consider the gods to be evil as a result of their actions, instead the answer for most situations in Greek mythology was the power of [[fate]].&lt;ref name=Fate&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bolle|first1=Kees|title=Fate|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=nysl_ce_colgul&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R12&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3424501004&amp;&amp;docId=GALE%7cCX3424501004&amp;docType=GALE|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fate is considered to be more powerful than the gods themselves and for this reason no one can escape it.&lt;ref name="Fate"/&gt; For this reason the Greeks recognized that unfortunate events were justifiable by the idea of fate.&lt;ref name="Fate"/&gt;

Later Greek and Roman theologians and philosophers discussed the problem of evil in depth. Starting at least with Plato, philosophers tended to reject or de-emphasize literal interpretations of mythology in favor of a more [[Pantheism|pantheistic]], [[natural theology]] based on reasoned arguments. In this framework, stories that seemed to impute dishonorable conduct to the gods were often simply dismissed as false, and as being nothing more than the "imagination of poets."  Greek and Roman thinkers continued to wrestle, however, with the problems of [[natural evil]] and of evil that we observe in our day-to-day experience.  Influential Roman writers such as [[De Natura Deorum|Cicero]] and [[De Providentia|Seneca]], drawing on earlier work by the Greek philosophers such as the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], developed many arguments in defense of the righteousness of the gods, and many of the answers they provided were later absorbed into Christian [[theodicy]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Buddhism===
[[Buddhism]] neither denies the existence of evil, nor does it attempt to reconcile evil in a way attempted by monotheistic religions that assert the existence of an almighty, all powerful, all knowing, all benevolent God.&lt;ref name=koslowski10&gt;{{cite book|author=P.

Buddhism accepts that there is evil in the world, as well as [[Dukkha]] (suffering) that is caused by evil or because of natural causes (aging, disease, rebirth). The precepts and practices of Buddhism, such as [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[Noble Eightfold Path]] aim to empower a follower in gaining insights and liberation ([[nirvana]]) from the cycle of such suffering as well as rebirth.&lt;ref name=koslowski10/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Williams|author2=Anthony Tribe|author3=Alexander Wynne|title=Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BVvFBQAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-52087-7 |pages=30–52 |chapter=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some strands of Mahayana Buddhism developed a theory of [[Buddha-nature]] in texts such as the ''Tathagata-garbha Sutras'' composed in 3rd-century south India, which is very similar to the "soul, self" theory found in classical Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|pages=103–09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

Further, the ''Tathagata-garbha Sutras'' are atypical texts of Buddhism, because they contradict the [[Anatta]] doctrines in a vast majority of Buddhist texts, leading scholars to posit that the ''Tathagatagarbha Sutras'' were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists, and that they do not represent mainstream Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|pages=104–05, 108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Merv Fowler|title=Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7UKjtA0QDwC|year=1999|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-898723-66-0|pages=101–02|quote=Some texts of the ''tathagatagarbha'' literature, such as the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' actually refer to an ''atman'', though other texts are careful to avoid the term.

The mainstream Buddhism, from its early days, did not need to address the theological problem of evil as it saw no need for a creator of the universe and asserted instead, like many Indian traditions, that the universe never had a beginning and all existence is an endless cycle of rebirths (samsara).&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p141"/&gt;

Further, [[Deity|deities]] in Hinduism are neither eternal nor omnipotent nor omniscient nor omnibenevolent. [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] are mortal and subject to [[samsara]].

For that would lead to the possibility of partiality and cruelty. For it can be reasonably concluded that God has passion and hatred like some ignoble persons... Hence there will be a nullification of God's nature of extreme purity, (unchangeability), etc., [...] And owing to infliction of misery and destruction on all creatures, God will be open to the charge of pitilessness and extreme cruelty, abhorred even by a villain. Thus on account of the possibility of partiality and cruelty, God is not an agent.

A sub-tradition within the [[Vaishnavism]] school of Hinduism that is an exception is dualistic [[Dvaita]], founded by [[Madhvacharya]] in the 13th-century.

Madhvacharya asserted, ''Yathecchasi tatha kuru'', which Sharma translates and explains as "one has the right to choose between right and wrong, a choice each individual makes out of his own responsibility and his own risk".{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=361}} Madhva's reply does not address the problem of evil, state Dasti and Bryant, as to how can evil exist with that of a God who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw&gt;{{cite book|author=David Buchta |editor=Matthew R.

According to Sharma, "Madhva's tripartite classification of souls makes it unnecessary to answer the problem of evil".{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=270, 370–71, ''Quote:'' The problem of evil and suffering in the world is the most difficult one in Theism. We have explained Madhva's attitude to the allied problem of freedom and freewill, on the basis of the doctrine of natural selection of good or bad and of the tripartite classification of souls. It is not therefore necessary for Madhva to answer the question of the consistency of evil with Divine goodness.}} According to David Buchta, this does not address the problem of evil, because the omnipotent God "could change the system, but chooses not to" and thus sustains the evil in the world.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw/&gt; This view of self's agency of Madhvacharya was, states Buchta, an outlier in Vedanta school and Indian philosophies in general.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw/&gt;

[[File:Epikouros BM 1843.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The earliest statement of the problem of evil is attributed to Epicurus, but this is uncertain.&lt;ref name=mcbrayer26/&gt;]]

===Epicurus===
[[Epicurus]] is generally credited with first expounding the problem of evil, and it is sometimes called the "[[Epicurean paradox]]", the "riddle of Epicurus", or the "Epicurus' [[trilemma]]":

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent.
Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent.
Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil?
Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?
&lt;/poem&gt;
|The Epicurean paradox|~300 BCE&lt;ref&gt;Hospers, John. ''An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis''. 3rd Ed. Routledge, 1990, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is no surviving written text of Epicurus that establishes that he actually formulated the problem of evil in this way, and it is uncertain that he was the author.&lt;ref name=mcbrayer26&gt;{{cite book|author1=Justin P.

{{quote|But if this account is true, which the Stoics were in no manner able to see, that argument also of Epicurus is done away. God, he says, either wishes to take away evils, and is unable; or He is able and is unwilling; or He is neither willing nor able, or He is both willing and able. If He is willing and is unable, He is feeble, which is not in accordance with the character of God; if He is able and unwilling, He is envious, which is equally at variance with God; if He is neither willing or able, He is both envious and feeble, and therefore not God; if He is both willing and able, which alone is suitable to God,
from what source then are evils or why does He not remove them?

}} where Lactantius critiques the argument. Epicurus's argument as presented by Lactantius actually argues that a god that is all-powerful and all-good does not exist and that the gods are distant and uninvolved with man's concerns. The gods are neither our friends nor enemies.

===David Hume===
[[David Hume]]'s formulation of the problem of evil in ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Is he [God] willing to prevent evil, but not able? then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing? then is he malevolent. Is he both able and willing? whence then is evil?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hume, David |title=Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion |publisher=Project Gutenberg |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4583 |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[God's] power we allow [is] infinite: Whatever he wills is executed: But neither man nor any other animal are happy: Therefore he does not will their happiness. His wisdom is infinite: He is never mistaken in choosing the means to any end: But the course of nature tends not to human or animal felicity: Therefore it is not established for that purpose. Through the whole compass of human knowledge, there are no inferences more certain and infallible than these. In what respect, then, do his benevolence and mercy resemble the benevolence and mercy of men?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Gottfried Leibniz===
[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Gottfried Leibniz]]

In his ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]]'', the [[scepticism|sceptic]] [[Pierre Bayle]] denied the goodness and omnipotence of God on account of the [[suffering]]s experienced in this earthly life. [[Gottfried Leibniz]] introduced the term theodicy in his 1710 work ''[[Essais de Théodicée sur la bonté de Dieu, la liberté de l'homme et l'origine du mal]]'' ("Theodicic Essays on the Benevolence of God, the Free will of man, and the Origin of Evil") which was directed mainly against Bayle. He argued that this is the [[best of all possible worlds]] that God could have created.

Imitating the example of Leibniz, other philosophers also called their treatises on the problem of evil theodicies. [[Voltaire]]'s popular novel ''[[Candide]]'' mocked Leibnizian optimism through the fictional tale of a naive youth.

=== Thomas Robert Malthus ===
The population and economic theorist [[Thomas Malthus]] stated in a 1798 essay that people with health problems or disease are not suffering, and should not viewed as such. Malthus argued, "Nothing can appear more consonant to our reason than that those beings which come out of the creative process of the world in lovely and beautiful forms should be crowned with immortality, while those which come out misshapen, those whose minds are not suited to a purer and happier state of existence, should perish and be condemned to mix again with their original clay. Eternal condemnation of this kind may be considered as a species of eternal punishment, and it is not wonderful that it should be represented, sometimes, under images of suffering."&lt;ref&gt;Malthus T.R. 1798. An essay on the principle of population. Oxford World's Classics reprint. p158&lt;/ref&gt;

Malthus believed in the Supreme Creator, considered suffering as justified, and suggested that God should be considered "as pursuing the creatures that had offended him with eternal hate and torture, instead of merely condemning to their original insensibility those beings that, by the operation of general laws, had not been formed with qualities suited to a purer state of happiness."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Malthus (1798), [http://www.esp.org/books/malthus/population/malthus.pdf An essay on the principle of population], Oxford Classics, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
[[Immanuel Kant]] wrote an essay on theodicy.&lt;ref name=dembski11&gt;[http://www.designinference.com/documents/2003.04.CTNS_theodicy.pdf Making the Task of Theodicy Impossible?], William Dembski (2003), Baylor University, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested, states William Dembski, that any successful theodicy must prove one of three things: [1] what one deems contrary to the purposefulness of world is not so; [2] if one deems it is contrary, then one must consider it not as a positive fact, but inevitable consequence of the nature of things; [3] if one accepts that it is a positive fact, then one must posit that it is not the work of God, but of some other beings such as man or superior spirits, good or evil.&lt;ref name=dembski11/&gt;

Kant did not attempt or exhaust all theodicies to help address the problem of evil. He claimed there is a reason all possible theodicies must fail.&lt;ref&gt;See Kant's essay, "Concerning the Possibility of a Theodicy and the Failure of All Previous Philosophical Attempts in the Field" (1791). Stephen Palmquist explains why Kant refuses to solve the problem of evil in "Faith in the Face of Evil", Appendix VI of [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp2 Kant's Critical Religion] (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; While a successful philosophical theodicy has not been achieved in his time, added Kant, there is no basis for a successful anti-theodicy either.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designinference.com/documents/2003.04.CTNS_theodicy.pdf Making the Task of Theodicy Impossible?], William Dembski (2003), Baylor University, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problem of good===
Several philosophers&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3327264] Cahn, Stephen M. (1977). Cacodaemony. Analysis, Vol. 37, No. 2, pp. 69–73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7247672&amp;jid=RES&amp;volumeId=-1&amp;issueId=-1&amp;aid=7247664&amp;fromPage=cupadmin&amp;pdftype=6316268&amp;repository=authInst]  Law, Stephen (2010). The Evil-God Challenge. Religious Studies 46 (3): 353–73&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that just as there exists a problem of evil for theists who believe in an omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent being, so too is there a problem of good for anyone who believes in an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnimalevolent (or perfectly evil) being. As it appears that the defenses and theodicies which might allow the theist to resist the problem of evil can be inverted and used to defend belief in the omnimalevolent being, this suggests that we should draw similar conclusions about the success of these defensive strategies. In that case, the theist appears to face a dilemma: either to accept that both sets of responses are equally bad, and so that the theist does not have an adequate response to the problem of evil; or to accept that both sets of responses are equally good, and so to commit to the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnimalevolent being as plausible.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Critics have noted that theodicies and defenses are often addressed to the logical problem of evil. As such, they are intended only to demonstrate that it is ''possible'' that evil can co-exist with an omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent being. Since the relevant parallel commitment is only that good can co-exist with an omniscient, omnipotent and omnimalevolent being, not that it is plausible that they should do so, the theist who is responding to the problem of evil need not be committing himself to something he is likely to think is false.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3327697 Cacodaemony and Devilish Isomorphism], King-Farlow, J. (1978), Cacodaemony and Devilish Isomorphism, Analysis, Vol. 38, No. 1, pp. 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt; This reply, however, leaves the evidential problem of evil untouched.

===Morality===
Another general criticism is that though a theodicy may harmonize God with the existence of evil, it does so at the cost of nullifying morality. This is because most theodicies assume that whatever evil there is exists because it is required for the sake of some greater good. But if an evil is necessary because it secures a greater good, then it appears we humans have no duty to prevent it, for in doing so we would also prevent the greater good for which the evil is required. Even worse, it seems that any action can be rationalized, as if one succeeds in performing it, then God has permitted it, and so it must be for the greater good. From this line of thought one may conclude that, as these conclusions violate our basic moral intuitions, no greater good theodicy is true, and God does not exist. Alternatively, one may point out that greater good theodicies lead us to see every conceivable state of affairs as compatible with the existence of God, and in that case the notion of God's goodness is rendered meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Dittman, Volker and Tremblay, François {{cite web|title=The Immorality of Theodicies

'''Process philosophy''' — also '''ontology of becoming''', '''processism''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher]], ''Process Metaphysics: An Introduction to Process Philosophy'', SUNY Press, 1996, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''philosophy of organism'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy Emmet]], 1932, ''Whitehead's Philosophy of Organism'', London: Macmillan; 2nd edn, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; — identifies [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[reality]] with [[Change (philosophy)|change]]. In opposition to the classical model of change as illusory (as argued by Parmenides) or accidental (as argued by Aristotle), process philosophy regards change as the cornerstone of reality—the cornerstone of [[being]] thought of as [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]].

Since the time of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], philosophers have posited true reality as "timeless", based on permanent [[Substance theory|substance]]s, while processes are denied or subordinated to timeless substances. If [[Socrates]] changes, becoming sick, Socrates is still the same (the substance of Socrates being the same), and change (his sickness) only glides over his substance: change is accidental, whereas the substance is essential. Therefore, classic [[ontology]] denies any full reality to change, which is conceived as only accidental and not essential. This classical ontology is what made knowledge and a [[theory of knowledge]] possible, as it was thought that a science of something in becoming was an impossible feat to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Fagot-Largeau, [http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm 7 December 2006 course] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206183341/http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm |date=6 February 2009 }} at the [[Collège of France]], first part of a series of courses on the "Ontology of Becoming" {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers who appeal to process rather than substance include [[Heraclitus]], [[Karl Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24196-marx-and-whitehead-process-dialectics-and-the-critique-of-capitalism/ Marx and Whitehead: Process, Dialectics, and the Critique of Capitalism]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]],  [[Alfred North Whitehead]], [[Alfred Korzybski]], [[R. G. Collingwood]], [[Alan Watts]], [[Robert M. Pirsig]], [[Charles Hartshorne]], [[Arran Gare]], [[Nicholas Rescher]], [[Colin Wilson]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Gilles Deleuze]]. In physics, [[Ilya Prigogine]]&lt;ref&gt;Ilya Prigogine, ''From being to becoming'', W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes between the "physics of being" and the "physics of becoming". Process philosophy covers not just scientific intuitions and experiences, but can be used as a conceptual bridge to facilitate discussions among religion, philosophy, and science.&lt;ref name="Hustwit"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeremy R. Hustwit|title=Process Philosophy: 2.a. In Pursuit of a Holistic Worldview |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/processp/#SH2a|publisher=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Michel Weber]] (ed.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/6359324/Michel_Weber_ed._After_Whitehead_Rescher_on_Process_Metaphysics_2004 After Whitehead: Rescher on Process Metaphysics]'', Frankfurt / Paris / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Process philosophy is sometimes classified as closer to [[Continental philosophy]] than [[analytic philosophy]], because it is usually only taught in Continental departments.&lt;ref&gt;William Blattner, [http://faculty.georgetown.edu/blattnew/contanalytic.html "Some Thoughts About "Continental" and "Analytic" Philosophy"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, other sources state that process philosophy should be placed somewhere in the middle between the poles of analytic versus Continental methods in contemporary philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=process-philosophy |title=Process Philosophy |last=Seibt |first=Johanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Gaskill, A. J. Nocek, ''The Lure of Whitehead'', University of Minnesota Press, 2014, p. 4: "it is no wonder that Whitehead fell by the wayside. He was too scientific for the "continentals," not scientific enough for the "analytics," and too metaphysical—which is to say [[Critical philosophy|uncritical]]—for them both" and p. 231: "the analytics and Continentals are both inclined toward [[Kantianism|Kantian]] presuppositions in a manner that Latour and Whitehead brazenly renounce."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Original research|date=September 2007}}

=== In ancient Greek thought ===

Heraclitus proclaimed that the basic nature of all things is change.

The quotation from [[Heraclitus]] appears in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' twice; in 401d as:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' Paragraph [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171%3Atext%3DCrat.%3Asection%3D401d Crat. 401 section d line 5].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|grc|τὰ ὄντα ἰέναι τε πάντα καὶ μένειν οὐδέν}}&lt;br/&gt;''Ta onta ienai te panta kai menein ouden''&lt;br/&gt;"All entities move and nothing remains still"&lt;/blockquote&gt;and in 402a&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Crat.+402&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171 Paragraph 402 section a line 8].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|grc|"πάντα χωρεῖ καὶ οὐδὲν μένει" καὶ "δὶς ἐς τὸν αὐτὸν ποταμὸν οὐκ ἂν ἐμβαίης"}}&lt;br/&gt;''Panta chōrei kai ouden menei kai dis es ton auton potamon ouk an embaies''
&lt;br /&gt;"Everything changes and nothing remains still&amp;nbsp;... and&amp;nbsp;... you cannot step twice into the same stream"&lt;ref&gt;This sentence has been translated by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] in Epistulae, [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/sen/seneca.ep6.shtml VI, 58, 23].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heraclitus considered fire as the most fundamental element.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"All things are an interchange for fire, and fire for all things, just like goods for gold and gold for goods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=William|title=Heraclitus: The Complete Philosophical Fragments|url=http://community.middlebury.edu/~harris/Philosophy/Heraclitus.html|website=Middlebury College|accessdate=3 October 2015|ref=DK B90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following is an interpretation of Heraclitus's concepts into modern terms by Nicholas Rescher.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...reality is not a constellation of things at all, but one of processes.  The fundamental "stuff" of the world is not material substance, but volatile flux, namely "fire", and all things are versions thereof (puros tropai).  Process is fundamental: the river is not an object, but a continuing flow; the sun is not a thing, but an enduring fire.  Everything is a matter of process, of activity, of change (panta rhei)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rescher|first1=Nicholas|title=Process philosophy a survey of basic issues|date=2000|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|location=[Pittsburgh]|isbn=0822961288|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An early expression of this viewpoint is in [[Heraclitus]]'s fragments. He posits strife, ''ἡ ἔρις'' (strife, conflict), as the underlying basis of all reality defined by change.&lt;ref&gt;Wheelwright, P. (1959). ''Heraclitus'', Oxford University Press, Oxford UK, {{ISBN|0-19-924022-1}}, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; The balance and opposition in strife were the foundations of change and stability in the flux of existence.

===Twentieth century===
In early twentieth century, the [[philosophy of mathematics]] was undertaken to develop mathematics as an airtight, axiomatic system in which every truth could be derived logically from a set of axioms. In the [[foundations of mathematics]], this project is variously understood as [[logicism]] or as part of the [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalist]] program of [[David Hilbert]]. [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] attempted to complete, or at least facilitate, this program with their seminal book [[Principia Mathematica]], which purported to build a logically consistent [[set theory]] on which to found mathematics. After this, Whitehead extended his interest to natural science, which he held needed a deeper philosophical basis. He intuited that natural science was struggling to overcome a traditional ontology of timeless material substances that does not suit natural phenomena. According to Whitehead, material is more properly understood as 'process'. In 1929, he produced the most famous work of process philosophy, ''[[Process and Reality]]'',&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"/&gt; continuing the work begun by [[Hegel]] but describing a more complex and fluid dynamic ontology.

Process thought describes truth as "movement" in and through substance ([[Hegelian]] truth), rather than [[substance theory|substances]] as fixed concepts or "things" ([[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] truth). Since Whitehead, process thought is distinguished from [[Hegel]] in that it describes entities that arise or coalesce in ''becoming'', rather than being simply dialectically determined from prior posited determinates. These entities are referred to as ''complexes of occasions of experience''. It is also distinguished in being not necessarily conflictual or oppositional in operation. Process may be integrative, destructive or both together, allowing for aspects of interdependence, influence, and confluence, and addressing coherence in universal as well as particular developments, i.e., those aspects not befitting Hegel's system. Additionally, instances of determinate occasions of experience, while always ephemeral, are nonetheless seen as important to define the type and continuity of those occasions of experience that flow from or relate to them.

==Whitehead's ''Process and Reality''==
[[Alfred North Whitehead]] began teaching and writing on process and metaphysics when he joined [[Harvard University]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/whitehed/|title= Alfred North Whitehead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Science and the Modern World'' (1925), Whitehead noted that the human intuitions and experiences of science, aesthetics, ethics, and religion influence the worldview of a community, but that in the last several centuries science dominates [[Western culture]]. Whitehead sought a holistic, comprehensive [[Cosmology (philosophy)|cosmology]] that provides a systematic descriptive theory of the world which can be used for the diverse human intuitions gained through ethical, aesthetic, religious, and scientific experiences, and not just the scientific.&lt;ref name="Hustwit"/&gt;

Whitehead's influences were not restricted to philosophers or physicists or mathematicians. He was influenced by the French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]] (1859–1941), whom he credits along with [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]] in the preface to ''Process and Reality''.&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1929). ''Process and Reality'', Macmillan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process metaphysics===

For Whitehead, metaphysics is about logical frameworks for the conduct of discussions of the character of the world. It is not directly and immediately about facts of nature, but only indirectly so, in that its task is to explicitly formulate the language and conceptual presuppositions that are used to describe the facts of nature. Whitehead thinks that discovery of previously unknown facts of nature can in principle call for reconstruction of metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1929), pp. 13, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process metaphysics elaborated in ''[[Process and Reality]]''&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"/&gt; posits an ontology which is based on the two kinds of existence of [[entity]], that of actual entity and that of abstract entity or [[abstraction]], also called 'object'.&lt;ref&gt;Palter, R.M. (1960). ''Whitehead's Philosophy of Science'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago IL, p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Actual entity''' is a term coined by Whitehead to refer to the entities that really exist in the natural world.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"&gt;Robert Audi. 1995, ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy.'' Cambridge: The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge. 851–853.&lt;/ref&gt; For Whitehead, actual entities are spatiotemporally extended events or processes.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; An actual entity is how something is happening, and how its happening is related to other actual entities.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; The actually existing world is a multiplicity of actual entities overlapping one another.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt;

The ultimate abstract principle of actual existence for Whitehead is '''creativity'''. Creativity is a term coined by Whitehead to show a power in the world that allows the presence of an actual entity, a new actual entity, and multiple actual entities.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; Creativity is the principle of novelty.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; It is manifest in what can be called 'singular causality'. This term may be contrasted with the term 'nomic causality'. An example of singular causation is that I woke this morning because my alarm clock rang. An example of nomic causation is that alarm clocks generally wake people in the morning. Aristotle recognizes singular causality as [[Four causes#Efficient cause|efficient causality]]. For Whitehead, there are many contributory singular causes for an event. A further contributory singular cause of my being awoken by my alarm clock this morning was that I was lying asleep near it till it rang.

An actual entity is a general philosophical term for an utterly determinate and completely concrete individual particular of the actually existing world or universe of [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)#IX: Theta|changeable entities]] considered in terms of singular causality, about which categorical statements can be made. Whitehead's most far-reaching and radical contribution to metaphysics is his invention of a better way of choosing the actual entities. Whitehead chooses a way of defining the actual entities that makes them all alike, ''qua'' actual entities, with a single exception.

For example, for [[Aristotle]], the actual entities were the [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)#Summary#Zeta|substance]]s, such as Socrates. Besides Aristotle's ontology of substances, another example of an ontology that posits actual entities is in the [[Monadology|monads]] of [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], which are said to be 'windowless'.

====Whitehead's actual entities====

For Whitehead's ontology of processes as defining the world, the actual entities exist as the only fundamental elements of reality.

The actual entities are of two kinds, temporal and atemporal.

With one exception, all actual entities for Whitehead are '''temporal''' and are '''[[wiktionary:actual occasions|occasions of experience]]''' (which are not to be confused with [[consciousness]]). An entity that people commonly think of as a simple concrete [[object (philosophy)|object]], or that Aristotle would think of as a substance, is, in this ontology, considered to be a temporally serial composite of indefinitely many overlapping occasions of experience. A human being is thus composed of indefinitely many occasions of experience.

The one exceptional actual entity is at once both temporal and '''atemporal''': God. He is objectively immortal, as well as being immanent in the world. He is objectified in each temporal actual entity; but He is not an eternal object.

The occasions of experience are of four grades. The first grade comprises processes in a physical vacuum such as the propagation of an electromagnetic wave or gravitational influence across empty space. The occasions of experience of the second grade involve just inanimate matter; "matter" being the composite overlapping of occasions of experience from the previous grade. The occasions of experience of the third grade involve living organisms. Occasions of experience of the fourth grade involve experience in the mode of presentational immediacy, which means more or less what are often called the [[qualia]] of subjective experience. So far as we know, experience in the mode of presentational immediacy occurs in only more evolved animals. That some occasions of experience involve experience in the mode of presentational immediacy is the one and only reason why Whitehead makes the occasions of experience his actual entities; for the actual entities must be of the ultimately general kind. Consequently, it is inessential that an occasion of experience have an aspect in the mode of presentational immediacy; occasions of the grades one, two, and three, lack that aspect.

There is no [[Mind-body dualism|mind-matter duality]] in this ontology, because "mind" is simply seen as an abstraction from an occasion of experience which has also a material aspect, which is of course simply another abstraction from it; thus the mental aspect and the material aspect are abstractions from one and the same concrete occasion of experience. The brain is part of the body, both being abstractions of a kind known as ''persistent physical objects'', neither being actual entities. Though not recognized by Aristotle, there is biological evidence, written about by [[Galen]],&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, R. E. (1973). ''Galen: On Psychology, Psychopathology, and Function and Diseases of the Nervous System. An Analysis of his Doctrines, Observations, and Experiments'', Karger, Basel, {{ISBN|978-3-8055-1479-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that the human brain is an essential seat of human experience in the mode of presentational immediacy. We may say that the brain has a material and a mental aspect, all three being abstractions from their indefinitely many constitutive occasions of experience, which are actual entities.

=====Time, causality, and process=====

Inherent in each actual entity is its respective dimension of time. Potentially, each Whiteheadean occasion of experience is causally consequential on every other occasion of experience that precedes it in time, and has as its causal consequences every other occasion of experience that follows it in time; thus it has been said that Whitehead's occasions of experience are 'all window', in contrast to Leibniz's 'windowless' monads. In time defined relative to it, each occasion of experience is causally influenced by prior occasions of experiences, and causally influences future occasions of experience. An occasion of experience consists of a process of prehending other occasions of experience, reacting to them. This is the process in process philosophy.

Such process is never deterministic. Consequently, [[free will]] is essential and inherent to the universe.

The causal outcomes obey the usual well-respected rule that the causes precede the effects in time. Some pairs of processes cannot be connected by cause-and-effect relations, and they are said to be [[Spacetime#Basic concepts#Space-like interval|spatially separated]]. This is in perfect agreement with the viewpoint of the Einstein theory of [[special relativity]] and with the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski geometry]] of spacetime.&lt;ref name="Naber"&gt;Naber, G. L. (1992). ''The Geometry of Minkowski Spacetime. An Introduction to the Mathematics of the Special Theory of Relativity'', Springer, New York, {{ISBN|978-0-387-97848-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that Whitehead respected these ideas, as may be seen for example in his 1919 book ''An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge''&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1919"&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1919). ''An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in ''[[Process and Reality]]''. Time in this view is relative to an inertial reference frame, different reference frames defining different versions of time.

=====Atomicity=====

The actual entities, the occasions of experience, are logically '''atomic''' in the sense that an occasion of experience cannot be cut and separated into two other occasions of experience. This kind of logical atomicity is perfectly compatible with indefinitely many spatio-temporal overlaps of occasions of experience. One can explain this kind of atomicity by saying that an occasion of experience has an internal causal structure that could not be reproduced in each of the two complementary sections into which it might be cut. Nevertheless, an actual entity can completely contain each of indefinitely many other actual entities.

Another aspect of the atomicity of occasions of experience is that they do not change. An actual entity is what it is. An occasion of experience can be described as a process of change, but it is itself unchangeable.

The reader should bear in mind that the atomicity of the actual entities is of a simply logical or philosophical kind, thoroughly different in concept from the natural kind of atomicity that describes the [[atom]]s of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].

=====Topology=====

Whitehead's theory of extension was concerned with the spatio-temporal features of his occasions of experience. Fundamental to both Newtonian and to quantum theoretical mechanics is the concept of velocity. The measurement of a velocity requires a finite spatiotemporal extent. Because it has no finite spatiotemporal extent, a single point of Minkowski space cannot be an occasion of experience, but is an abstraction from an infinite set of overlapping or contained occasions of experience, as explained in ''Process and Reality''.&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"/&gt; Though the occasions of experience are atomic, they are not necessarily separate in extension, spatiotemporally, from one another. Indefinitely many occasions of experience can '''overlap''' in Minkowski space.

Nexus is a term coined by Whitehead to show the network actual entity from universe. In the universe of actual entities spread&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; actual entity. Actual entities are clashing with each other and form other actual entities.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; The birth of an actual entity based on an actual entity, actual entities around him referred to as nexus.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt;

An example of a nexus of temporally overlapping occasions of experience is what Whitehead calls an '''enduring physical object''', which corresponds closely with an Aristotelian substance. An enduring physical object has a temporally earliest and a temporally last member. Every member (apart from the earliest) of such a nexus is a causal consequence of the earliest member of the nexus, and every member (apart from the last) of such a nexus is a causal antecedent of the last member of the nexus. There are indefinitely many other causal antecedents and consequences of the enduring physical object, which overlap, but are not members, of the nexus. No member of the nexus is spatially separate from any other member. Within the nexus are indefinitely many continuous streams of overlapping nexūs, each stream including the earliest and the last member of the enduring physical object. Thus an enduring physical object, like an Aristotelian substance, undergoes changes and adventures during the course of its existence.

In some contexts, especially in the [[theory of relativity]] in physics, the word 'event' refers to a single point in Minkowski or in Riemannian space-time. A point event is not a process in the sense of Whitehead's metaphysics. Neither is a countable sequence or array of points. A Whiteheadian process is most importantly characterized by extension in space-time, marked by a continuum of uncountably many points in a Minkowski or a Riemannian space-time. The word 'event', indicating a Whiteheadian actual entity, is not being used in the sense of a point event.

====Whitehead's abstractions====

Whitehead's '''abstractions''' are conceptual entities that are abstracted from or derived from and founded upon his actual entities. Abstractions are themselves not actual entities. They are the only entities that can be real but are not actual entities. This statement is one form of Whitehead's 'ontological principle'.

An abstraction is a conceptual entity that refers to more than one single actual entity. Whitehead's ontology refers to importantly structured collections of actual entities as nexuses of actual entities. Collection of actual entities into a '''nexus''' emphasizes some aspect of those entities, and that emphasis is an abstraction, because it means that some aspects of the actual entities are emphasized or dragged away from their actuality, while other aspects are de-emphasized or left out or left behind.

'Eternal object' is a term coined by Whitehead. It is an abstraction, a possibility, or pure potential. It can be ingredient into some actual entity.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; It is a principle that can give a particular form to an actual entity.&lt;ref name="Cobb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Michel Weber]] (ed.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279952/After_Whitehead_Rescher_on_Process_Metaphysics After Whitehead: Rescher on Process Metaphysics]'', Frankfurt / Paris / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, 2004 ({{ISBN|3-937202-49-8}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead admitted indefinitely many eternal objects. An example of an '''eternal object''' is a number, such as the number 'two'. Whitehead held that eternal objects are abstractions of a very high degree of abstraction. Many abstractions, including eternal objects, are potential ingredients of processes.

====Relation between actual entities and abstractions stated in the ontological principle====

For Whitehead, besides its temporal generation by the actual entities which are its contributory causes, a process may be considered as a concrescence of abstract '''ingredient''' eternal objects. God enters into every temporal actual entity.

Whitehead's '''ontological principle''' is that whatever reality pertains to an abstraction is derived from the actual entities upon which it is founded or of which it is comprised.

====Causation and concrescence of a process====
Concrescence is a term coined by Whitehead to show the process of jointly forming an actual entity that was without form, but about to manifest itself into an entity Actual full (''satisfaction'') based on datums or for information on the universe.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; The process of forming an actual entity is the case based on the existing datums. Concretion process can be regarded as ''subjectification process.''&lt;ref name="Cobb"&gt;John B. Cobb and David Ray Griffin. 1976, ''Process Theology, An Introduction. Philadelphia: The Westminster Press.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Datum is a term coined by Whitehead to show the different variants of information possessed by actual entity. In process philosophy, datum is obtained through the events of concrescence. Every actual entity has a variety of datum.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt;

==Commentary on Whitehead and on process philosophy==
Whitehead is not an [[idealism|idealist]] in the strict sense.{{which|date=May 2013}} Whitehead's thought may be regarded as related to the idea of [[panpsychism]] (also known as panexperientialism, because of Whitehead's emphasis on experience).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seager|first1=William|title=Whitehead and the Revival (?) of Panpsychism|url=http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~seager/whitehead.htm|website=University of Toronto Scarborough|publisher=University of Toronto at Scarborough|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On God ===
Whitehead's philosophy is very complex, subtle and nuanced and in order to comprehend his thinking regarding what is commonly referred to by many religions as "God", it is recommended that one read from ''Process and Reality Corrected Edition'', wherein regarding "God" the authors elaborate Whitehead's conception.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"He is the unconditioned actuality of conceptual feeling at the base of things; so that by reason of this primordial actuality, there is an order in the relevance of eternal objects to the process of creation (343 of 413) (Location 7624 of 9706 Kindle ed.)  Whitehead continues later with, "The particularities of the actual world presuppose it ; while it merely presupposes the general metaphysical character of creative advance, of which it is the primordial exemplification (344 of 413) (Location 7634 of 9706 Kindle Edition)." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Process philosophy, might be considered according to some theistic forms of religion to give a [[God#Process theology and process philosophy definition of God|God]] a special place in the universe of occasions of experience. Regarding Whitehead's use of the term, "occasions" in reference to, "God" it is explained in ''Process and Reality Corrected Edition'' that &lt;blockquote&gt;"'Actual entities'-also termed 'actual occasions'-are the final real things of which the world is made up. There is no going behind actual entities to find anything [28] more real.  They differ among themselves: God is an actual entity, and so is the most trivial puff of existence in far-off empty space.  But, though there are gradations of importance, and diversities of function, yet in the principles which actuality exemplifies all are on the same level.  The final facts are, all alike, actual entities; and these actual entities are drops of experience, complex and interdependent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It can be also be assumed within some forms of theology that a God encompasses all the other occasions of experience but also transcends them and this might lead to it being argued that Whitehead endorses some form of [[panentheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=John W.|title=Panentheism--The Other God of the Philosophers: From Plato to the Present|date=2006|publisher=Baker Academic|location=Grand Rapids MI|isbn=978-0801049316|page=176|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aokfbkOdjuEC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=Whitehead++panentheism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilv8Xpxb7UAhVGOCYKHaBCB-UQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Whitehead%20%20panentheism&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since, it is argued theologically, that "free will" is inherent to the nature of the universe, Whitehead's God is not omnipotent in Whitehead's metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dombrowski|first1=Daniel A.|title=Whitehead's Religious Thought: From Mechanism to Organism, From Force to Persuasion|date=2017|publisher=State Univ of New York Pr|location=Albany|isbn=978-1438464299|pages=33–35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ACKRDQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Whitehead%27s+God+is+not+omnipotent&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  God's role is to offer enhanced occasions of experience. God participates in the evolution of the universe by offering possibilities, which may be accepted or rejected. Whitehead's thinking here has given rise to [[process theology]], whose prominent advocates include [[Charles Hartshorne]], [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], and [[Hans Jonas]], who was also influenced by the non-theological philosopher Martin Heidegger. However, other process philosophers have questioned Whitehead's theology, seeing it as a regressive Platonism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hustwit|first1=J. R.|title=Process Philosophy|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/processp/|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (IEP)|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead enumerated three essential ''natures of God''. The ''primordial'' nature of God consists of all potentialities of existence for actual occasions, which Whitehead dubbed eternal objects. God can offer possibilities by ordering the relevance of eternal objects. The ''consequent'' nature of God prehends everything that happens in reality. As such, God experiences all of reality in a sentient manner. The last nature is the ''superjective''. This is the way in which God's synthesis becomes a sense-datum for other actual entities. In some sense, God is prehended by existing actual entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Viney|first1=Donald|title=Process Theism|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-theism/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosoph|publisher=Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), Stanford University|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy and applications ==
=== Biology ===
In [[plant morphology]], [[Rolf Sattler]] developed a process morphology (dynamic morphology) that overcomes the structure/process (or structure/function) dualism that is commonly taken for granted in biology. According to process morphology, structures such as leaves of plants do not have processes, they ''are'' processes.&lt;ref&gt;Sattler, R. 1990. "Towards a more dynamic plant morphology". ''[[Acta Biotheoretica]]'' 38: 303–315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sattler, R. 1992. "Process morphology: structural dynamics in development and evolution". ''[[Canadian Journal of Botany]]'' 70: 708–714.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[evolution]] and in [[Developmental biology|development]], the nature of the changes of biological objects are considered by many authors to be more radical than in physical systems. In biology, changes are not just changes of state in a pre-given space, instead the space and more generally the mathematical structures required to understand object change over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montévil|first=Maël|last2=Mossio|first2=Matteo|last3=Pocheville|first3=Arnaud|last4=Longo|first4=Giuseppe|date=2016-10-01|year=|title=Theoretical principles for biology: Variation|url=https://www.academia.edu/27942089/Theoretical_principles_for_biology_Variation|journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology|series=From the Century of the Genome to the Century of the Organism: New Theoretical Approaches|volume=122|issue=1|pages=36–50|doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.08.005|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Longo|first=Giuseppe|last2=Montévil|first2=Maël|last3=Kauffman|first3=Stuart|date=2012-01-01|year=|title=No Entailing Laws, but Enablement in the Evolution of the Biosphere|url=https://www.academia.edu/11720588/No_entailing_laws_but_enablement_in_the_evolution_of_the_biosphere|journal=Proceedings of the 14th Annual Conference Companion on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation|series=GECCO '12|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|volume=|pages=1379–1392|doi=10.1145/2330784.2330946|isbn=9781450311786|via=|arxiv=1201.2069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecology ===
With its perspective that everything is interconnected, that all life has value, and that non-human entities are also experiencing subjects, process philosophy has played an important role in discourse on ecology and sustainability. The first book to connect process philosophy with environmental ethics was [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]]'s 1971 work, ''Is It Too Late: A Theology of Ecology''.&lt;ref name="Is It Too Late"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cobb, Jr. |first1=John B. |title=Is It Too Late?: A Theology of Ecology |date=1971 |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company |isbn=978-0028012803 |url=https://www.amazon.com/too-late-theology-ecology/dp/0962680737}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more recent book (2018) edited by [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]] and Wm. Andrew Schwartz, ''Putting Philosophy to Work: Toward an Ecological Civilization''&lt;ref name="Putting Philosophy to Work"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cobb, Jr. |first1=John B. |last2=Scwhartz |first2=Wm. Andrew |title=Putting Philosophy to Work: Toward an Ecological Civilization |date=2018 |publisher=Process Century Press |location=Minnesota |isbn=978-1940447339 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Putting-Philosophy-Work-Ecological-Civilization/dp/194044733X}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributors explicitly explore the ways in which process philosophy can be put to work to address the most urgent issues facing our world today, by contributing to a transition toward an ecological civilization. That book emerged out of the largest international conference held on the theme of [[ecological civilization]] (''Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization'') which was organized by the Center for Process Studies in June 2015. The conference brought together roughly 2,000 participants from around the world and featured such leaders in the environmental movement as [[Bill McKibben]], [[Vandana Shiva]], [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], [[Wes Jackson]], and [[Sheri Liao]].&lt;ref name="conferencereport"&gt;Herman Greene, [http://www.ecozoicsocieties.org/musings/2015/re-imagining-civilization-as-ecological-report-on-the-seizing-an-alternative-toward-an-ecological-civilization-conference/ "Re-Imagining Civilization as Ecological: Report on the 'Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization' Conference"], last modified August 24, 2015, ''Center for Ecozoic Societies'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of [[ecological civilization]] is often affiliated with the process philosophy of [[Alfred North Whitehead]]--especially in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wang |first1=Zhihe |last2=Huili |first2=He |last3=Meijun |first3=Fan |title=The Ecological Civilization Debate in China: The Role of Ecological Marxism and Constructive Postmodernism—Beyond the Predicament of Legislation |url=https://monthlyreview.org/2014/11/01/the-ecological-civilization-debate-in-china/ |website=Monthly Review |accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], some of Whitehead's ideas re-emerged in combination with [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]] as the [[cognitive science of mathematics]] and [[embodied mind]] theses.

Somewhat earlier, exploration of [[mathematical practice]] and [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics]] from the 1950s to 1980s had sought alternatives to [[metamathematics]] in social behaviours around [[mathematics]] itself: for instance, [[Paul Erdős]]'s simultaneous belief in [[Platonism]] and a single "big book" in which all proofs existed, combined with his personal obsessive need or decision to collaborate with the widest possible number of other mathematicians. The process, rather than the outcomes, seemed to drive his explicit behaviour and odd use of language, as if the synthesis of Erdős and collaborators in seeking proofs, creating sense-datum for other mathematicians, was itself the expression of a divine will. Certainly, Erdős behaved as if nothing else in the world mattered, including money or love, as emphasized in his biography ''[[The Man Who Loved Only Numbers]]''.

=== Medicine ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
Several fields of science and especially [[medicine]] seem {{vague|date=May 2013}} to make liberal use of ideas in process philosophy, notably the theory of [[pain]] and [[healing]] of the late 20th century. The [[Philosophy of healthcare|philosophy of medicine]] began to deviate somewhat from [[scientific method]] and an emphasis on repeatable results in the very late 20th century by embracing [[Health system|population thinking]], and a more pragmatic approach to issues in [[public health]], [[environmental health]] and especially [[mental health]]. In this latter field, [[R. D. Laing]], [[Thomas Szasz]] and [[Michel Foucault]] were instrumental in moving medicine away from emphasis on "cures" and towards concepts of individuals in balance with their society, both of which are changing, and against which no benchmarks or finished "cures" were very likely to be measurable.

=== Psychology ===
In [[psychology]], the subject of imagination was again explored more extensively since Whitehead, and the question of feasibility or "eternal objects" of thought became central to the impaired [[theory of mind]] explorations that framed postmodern [[cognitive science]]. A biological understanding of the most eternal object, that being the emerging of similar but independent cognitive apparatus, led to an obsession with the process "embodiment", that being, the emergence of these [[cognition]]s. Like Whitehead's God, especially as elaborated in [[J. J. Gibson]]'s [[perceptual psychology]] emphasizing [[affordance]]s, by ordering the relevance of eternal objects (especially the cognitions of other such actors), the world becomes. Or, it becomes simple enough for human beings to begin to make choices, and to prehend what happens as a result. These experiences may be summed in some sense but can only approximately be shared, even among very similar cognitions with identical DNA. An early explorer of this view was [[Alan Turing]] who sought to prove the limits of expressive complexity of human genes in the late 1940s, to put bounds on the complexity of human [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] and so assess the feasibility of [[artificial intelligence]] emerging. Since 2000, Process Psychology has progressed as an independent academic and therapeutic discipline: In 2000, [[Michel Weber]] created the Whitehead Psychology Nexus: an open forum dedicated to the cross-examination of Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy and the various facets of the contemporary psychological field.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, John B., Jr. "Process Psychotherapy: Introduction". ''Process Studies'' vol. 29, no. 1 (Spring–Summer 2000): 97–102; cf. [[Michel Weber]] and Will Desmond (eds.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279955/Handbook_of_Whiteheadian_Process_Thought Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought]'', Frankfurt / Lancaster, ontos verlag, Process Thought X1 &amp; X2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1975">'''Reconstructivism''' is a [[philosophical theory]] holding that societies should continually reform themselves in order to establish more perfect governments or [[social network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.articleworld.org/index.php/Reconstructivism |title=Articleworld.org |accessdate=2008-04-26 |format=php |work=Reconstructivism }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ideology involves recombining or [[Recontextualisation|recontextualizing]] the ideas arrived at by the philosophy of [[deconstruction]], in which an existing system or medium is broken into its smallest meaningful elements and in which these elements are used to build a new system or medium  free from the strictures of the original.

Some thinkers have attempted to ascribe the term Reconstructivism to the post-postmodern art movement. In an essay by Chris Sunami, ([http://kitoba.com/pedia/Reconstructivist+Art.html Art Essays: Reconstructivist Art]) "reconstructivist art" is described as follows:

{{quote|A reconstructivist art work builds upon prior, [[deconstructionist]] artworks and techniques, but adapts them to classic themes and structures, with the goal of creating works of genuine emotion and significance. In this way, reconstructivism (when it works) combines the vitality and originality of deconstructionism with the comforts, pleasures and rewards of [[classicism]]. The overall purpose of reconstructivism is to reawaken a sense of the Real in a world where everything has been demonstrated to be an illusion.}}

One of the examples Sunami provides of this technique is the way some modern music incorporates deconstructed samples of older music and combines and arranges the samples in a new way as part of a new composition.

'''Stefan Basil Molyneux''' ({{IPAc-en|s|t|ə|ˈ|f|æ|n|_|ˈ|m|ɒ|l|ᵻ|nj|uː}}; born September 24, 1966) is a Canadian [[podcast]]er and [[List of YouTubers|YouTuber]]. Molyneux, a [[Self-publishing|self-published]] author, usually speaks on the topics of [[anarcho-capitalism]], politics, [[Romance (love)|relationships]], [[race and intelligence]],&amp;nbsp;[[multiculturalism]], [[libertarianism]], [[anti-feminism]],&lt;ref name="Goo"/&gt; and familial relationships.

A supporter of [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump's presidential campaign]], he has been described as [[alt-right]] by ''[[Politico]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'', and [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] by [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Krieg |first=Gregory |date=November 10, 2016 |title=How did Trump win?

== Background ==
Molyneux was born in Ireland and raised mainly in London before moving to Canada at age 11.&lt;ref name=Mississauga-2003 /&gt;  Molyneux attended the [[Glendon College]] of [[York University]], where he was an actor at Theatre Glendon&lt;ref name=Star-23Feb1988 /&gt; and a member of the Debating Society.&lt;ref name=ProTem-8Feb1988 /&gt; He then attended the [[National Theatre School of Canada]] in Montreal.&lt;ref name=Mississauga-2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Burg-Star /&gt; In 1991, Molyneux received a B.A. in History from [[McGill University]], where he was active in the [[Canadian University Society for Intercollegiate Debate|McGill Debating Union]]. He then went on to receive an M.A. in History from [[University of Toronto]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=Burg-Star /&gt;&lt;ref name=Globe-2008 /&gt;

== Career ==
In early 1995, Molyneux and his brother Hugh founded Caribou Systems Corporation, a Toronto-based provider of environmental database software. The company was sold in 2000.&lt;ref name="Burg-Star" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2002-01-28_Blue292" /&gt;

In 2005, Molyneux began a podcast called ''Freedomain Radio'' (''FDR'').&lt;ref name="freedomainradio"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fdrpodcasts.com/#/0 |title=An Introduction to Freedomain Radio |website=Freedomainradio.com |date= |accessdate=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He uses the same name for the website on which he distributes his own writings, hosts podcast archives, and provides an [[Internet forum]] for ''FDR'' listeners. Molyneux also produces videos and commentary on current events, and he presents a weekly call-in show on which listeners can ask questions or discuss personal issues.&lt;ref name="Globe-2008" /&gt; Molyneux funds his efforts by soliciting direct payment from listeners and viewers.&lt;ref name="Horsager-TheTrustEdge"&gt;{{cite book |last=Horsager |first=David |date=October 2012 |title=The Trust Edge: How top leaders gain faster results, deeper relationships, and a stronger bottom line |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |location=New York |pages=25–26 |oclc=820783989 |isbn=978-1-4767-1137-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Molyneux interviewed James Damore, the [[Google]] employee who was fired after writing the [[Google's Ideological Echo Chamber]] memo.&lt;ref name="Goo"&gt;{{cite news |last=Levin |first=Sam |date=August 9, 2017 |title=Fired Google memo writer gives first big interviews to rightwing YouTubers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/09/james-damore-google-memo-youtube-interviews |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Molyneux and Canadian internet personality [[Lauren Southern]] toured the Australian cities of [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kinsella |first1=Luke |title=What I learnt about the far right from Lauren Southern |url=https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/what-i-learnt-about-the-far-right-from-lauren-southern/news-story/0443ce7a7a09dc8431776f469b34ae0d |accessdate=31 July 2018 |publisher=[[News.com.au]] |date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NITV]] quotes Simon Copland, an SBS freelance writer, who thinks that Molyneux disparaged pre-colonisation [[Indigenous Australians|Australian Aboriginal]] culture, calling it "very violent", and downplayed massacres perpetrated against Aborigines, saying that the European takeover of Australia had been less violent than other such takeovers, and that the settlers "were trying to stop infanticide and mass rape".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Douglas |title=Far-right Canadian duo's vile rampage against Aboriginal culture at Sydney event |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/2017/07/30/far-right-canadian-duos-vile-rampage-against-aboriginal-culture-sydney-event |accessdate=31 July 2018 |publisher=[[National Indigenous Television]], [[Special Broadcasting Service]] |date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molyneux and Southern subsequently traveled to New Zealand for their speaking engagement at [[Auckland]]'s Powerstation theatre. The event was cancelled at the last minute when the Powerstation's owner rescinded the booking, citing opposition from local groups and the offensive content of their speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux's speaking event cancelled |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2018/08/lauren-southern-and-stefan-molyneux-s-secret-speaking-location-revealed-as-the-powerstation.html |accessdate=3 August 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Truebridge |first1=Nick |last2=Niall |first2=Todd |title=Auckland's Powerstation owner apologises for booking controversial speakers |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/106002242/aucklands-powerstation-owner-apologises-for-booking-controversial-speakers |accessdate=3 August 2018 |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Auckland venue cancels controversial far-right Canadian pair's speaking event |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/auckland-venue-cancels-controversial-far-right-canadian-pairs-speaking-event |accessdate=3 August 2018 |publisher=[[1 News]] |date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molyneux was a panelist at a 2014 Detroit conference held by the [[men's rights movement]] and [[manosphere]] organization, [[A Voice for Men]]. According to Jessica Roy of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Molyneux argued that violence in the world is the result of how women treat their children, and that "If we could just get people to be nice to their babies for five years straight, that would be it for war, drug abuse, addiction, promiscuity, sexually transmitted diseases, ... Almost all would be completely eliminated, because they all arise from dysfunctional early childhood experiences, which are all run by women."&lt;ref name="men"&gt;{{cite news |last=Roy |first=Jessica |date=July 2, 2014 |title=What I Learned as a Woman at a Men's-Rights Conference |url=http://time.com/2949435/what-i-learned-as-a-woman-at-a-mens-rights-conference/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alt-right ===
Molyneux has been described as a part of the "[[alt-right]]" by ''Politico'', ''Metro'', ''NY Magazine,'' ''Vanity Fair,'' and ''CBS,'' and has been described as "one of the alt-right's biggest YouTube stars" by ''Washington Post'' columnist J. J. McCullough.&lt;ref name="Politico17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Washp17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Metro17&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Adam |date=August 19, 2017 |title=Heartbroken mother describes how she lost her son to alt-right movement |url=https://metro.co.uk/2017/08/19/heartbroken-mother-pens-open-letter-to-son-she-lost-to-alt-right-movement-6864145/ |newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |access-date=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kilgore |first=Ed |date=August 14, 2017 |title=Don’t Look Now, But Alt-Right Demonstrations Are Scheduled for Nine Cities Next Weekend [Update: Now Cancelled] |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/08/alt-right-demonstrations-scheduled-for-9-cities-next-weekend.html |newspaper=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |access-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kosoff |first=Maya |date=August 9, 2017 |title=The Fired Google Engineer Is Doubling Down |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/james-damore-google-silicon-valley-culture-war |newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |access-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=August 9, 2017 |title=Fired Google Engineer Who Wrote Controversial Gender Essay Speaks Out |url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/08/09/google-gender-essay-fired-engineer-james-damore-legal-options/ |publisher=[[KPIX-TV]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Business Insider]]'' and [[BuzzFeed]] have characterized Molyneux as [[far-right]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tani |first=Maxwell |date=August 23, 2017 |title='UNLIMITED WAR': Breitbart and the far right start to turn on Trump over his Afghanistan decision |url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/far-right-trump-backers-pan-afghanistan-speech-2017-8 |newspaper=[[Business Insider]] |access-date=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ling |first=Justin |date=January 8, 2018 |title=The Far Right Can’t Decide If The Iran Protests Are A Good Thing, Or A George Soros Deep State Coup |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/justinling/the-far-right-cant-decide-if-the-iran-protests-are-a-good |publisher=[[BuzzFeed]] |access-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2016 YouTube video, Molyneux has denied that he identifies with the alt-right movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=S-Wn0J0eC6I|title=What Is The Alt-Right? Vox Day and Stefan Molyneux}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data &amp; Society, a research institute, described Molyneux as "a Canadian talk show host who promotes [[scientific racism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://datasociety.net/output/alternative-influence/|title=Alternative Influence|work=Data &amp; Society|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Family of origin (FOO) relationships ===
Molyneux refers to the family that people are born into as their "family of origin" or "FOO". Molyneux suggests that family of origin relationships may not necessarily be desirable, and in some circumstances may even be detrimental, and thus, for those individuals having suffered abusive childhood relationships, it would be advantageous for them to sever such involuntary relationships as adults, or "deFOO".&lt;ref name=Guardian-2008&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/nov/15/family-relationships-fdr-defoo-cult |title=You will never see me again |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=January 7, 2009 |first=Kate |last=Hilpern |date=November 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, he views all adult relationships as being voluntary and discretionary rather than obligatory. According to a 2008 article in ''[[The Guardian]]'', both Molyneux and his wife have "deFOOed".&lt;ref name=Guardian-2008 /&gt;

=== Stateless society ===
Molyneux theorizes that the pursuit of virtue in our personal lives could bring about a [[stateless society]] that abhors the initiation of force (see [[non-aggression principle]]). In addition, the free market (see [[anarcho-capitalism]]), [[polycentric law|polycentric legal system]]s and private "dispute resolution organizations" (DROs) could be empowered to find new and more peaceful ways of adjudicating [[common law]] infractions and contractual disputes.&lt;ref name=molyneux-DRO&gt;{{cite web|last=Molyneux|first=Stefan|title=The Stateless Society An Examination of Alternatives|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/2005/10/stefan-molyneux/the-stateless-society-an-examination-of-alternatives/|publisher=[[LewRockwell.com]]|date=October 24, 2005|accessdate= May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, libertarian philosopher [[David Gordon (philosopher)|David Gordon]] gave a critical examination of Molyneux's 2007 ''Universally Preferable Behaviour: A Rational Proof for Secular Ethics'' in ''The Mises Review'', stating, "He fails, and fails miserably. His arguments are often preposterously bad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mises.org/daily/6101/The-Molyneux-Problem |title=The Molyneux Problem &amp;#124; Mises Daily |publisher=Mises.org |date=2012-07-04 |accessdate=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gordon would reply again to Molyneux's own response to the criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/mr-molyneux-responds |title=Mr. Molyneux Responds; Mises Daily |publisher=Mises.org |date=2012-07-11 |accessdate=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== White genocide ===
Molyneux believes in the [[White genocide conspiracy theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/362284/alt-right-speakers-stefan-molyneux-and-lauren-southern-anger-nz-muslims |title=Alt-right speakers Stefan Molyneux and Lauren Southern anger NZ Muslims |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2018 interview with [[Lauren Southern]] about [[South African farm attacks|violence against white farmers in South Africa]], he stated that the media and [[NGOs]] were under-reporting the subject because they "don’t want to scare the whites in the west with what happens when whites become a minority in a highly aggressive and tribalised world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=White Farmers Slaughtered in South Africa {{!}} Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TfAq3LrIjg&amp;t=1288 |first=Stefan |last= Molyneux |date= February 10, 2018 |publisher= YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2018/jul/16/news-corps-promotion-of-lauren-southern-is-disturbing |title=News Corp Australia’s promotion of Lauren Southern is disturbing |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After portrait painter [[Kehinde Wiley]] was chosen to paint [[Barack Obama]]'s [[President Barack Obama (painting)|presidential portrait]], Molyneux called Wiley a "white genocide [[fetish artist]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2018/07/free-speech-group-says-dangerous-precedent-will-be-set-if-they-lose-lawsuit.html |title=Free-speech group says 'dangerous precedent' will be set if they lose lawsuit |publisher=''[[Newshub]]'' |date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting that in 2012 Wiley had created two paintings of black women holding up the severed heads of white women, which Wiley later referred to as "sort of a play on the 'kill [[whitey (slang)|whitey]]' thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=President Obama's Anti-White Racism Portrait Scandal |url=https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=98d_1518555494 |first=Stefan |last=Molyneux |date= February 13, 2018 |publisher=LiveLeak}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kehinde Wiley's Obama portrait controversy proves Americans struggle to engage with art |url= https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/kehinde-wiley-s-obama-portrait-controversy-shows-americans-don-t-ncna849156 |first=Seph |last= Rodney |date= Feb 18, 2018 |publisher=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult accusations==

According to [[Steven Hassan]], a mental health counselor with experience on cults, "Partly what's going on with the people on the Internet who are indoctrinated, they spend lots of hours on the computer. Videos can have them up all night for several nights in a row. Molyneux knows how to talk like he knows what he's talking about, despite very little academic research. He cites this and cites that, and presents it as the whole truth. It dismantles people's sense of self and replaces it with his sense of confidence about how to fix the world."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Collins, Ben (February 5, 2016). [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/05/meet-the-cult-leader-stumping-for-donald-trump.html Meet the 'Cult' Leader Stumping for Donald Trump.] ''The Daily Beast.'' Retrieved: October 12, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Tu Thanh Ha wrote that Molyneux was called the leader of a "therapy cult" following ''Freedomain Radio (FDR)'' community member Tom Bell breaking off all contact with his family.&lt;ref name="Globe-2008" /&gt; In April 2008, Bell had called in to the show asking about his [[veganism]] and his feeling of disgust towards people that eat meat.&lt;ref name="Times-2009"&gt;{{cite news |last=Whipple |first=Tom |date=January 10, 2009 |title=The mother and son torn apart by web 'cult' that destroys families |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-mother-and-son-torn-apart-by-web-cult-that-destroys-families-w8klkzndf50 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |accessdate= August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molyneux suggested that this disgust could have come from witnessing an authority figure who was cruel to animals.&lt;ref name="Times-2009" /&gt; Bell responded by describing memories of his father being verbally and physically cruel to the family cat, causing him to feel intimidated by the father, and then described his [[emotional detachment]] toward his mother and the rest of his family.&lt;ref name="Times-2009" /&gt;

The following month, Bell left a note stating he no longer wanted contact and left home. It was reported that, of the estimated 50,000 users of the website, about 20 (0.04%) ''FDR'' members had also "deFOOed" (disassociate from family of origin), and that many parents chose not to speak to the media in an effort to avoid alienating their children further.&lt;ref name=Times-2009 /&gt; A representative of the British [[Cult Information Centre]] said they were following ''FDR'', and noted that one sign of cults was that they cut people off from their families. Molyneux responded by saying, "If I advised a wife to leave an abusive husband, there would not be articles about how I am a cult leader."&lt;ref name="Times-2009" /&gt;

Molyneux and FOO were subjects of an investigative documentary by [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] in the [[United Kingdom]], which aired on August 20, 2015.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.channel5.com/shows/trapped-in-a-cult |title=Trapped In A Cult? |publisher=Channel 5 |date=2015-08-20 |accessdate=2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wyatt |first=Daisy |date=August 20, 2015 |title= Trapped in a Cult? – TV review: Disappointing Channel 5 shock-doc fails to come up to scratch |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/trapped-in-a-cult-tv-review-disappointing-channel-5-shock-doc-fails-to-come-up-to-scratch-10464473.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |access-date= November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molyneux and "deFOOing" were one of three subjects featured on the February 18, 2016 episode of the documentary series ''[[Dark Net (TV series)|Dark Net]]''. The episode calls ''Freedomain Radio'' a cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sho.com/dark-net/season/1/episode/5/trapped |title=Dark Net – Season 1, Episode 5 |website= Showtime |accessdate= 12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Napoli, 1969) - BEIC 6353768.jpg|thumb|[[Zeno of Citium]], bust in the [[Farnese collection]], Naples – Photo by [[Paolo Monti]], 1969.]]

'''Stoicism''' is a school of [[Hellenistic philosophy]] founded by [[Zeno of Citium]] in Athens in the early 3rd century BC. It was heavily influenced by certain teachings of [[Socrates]], while [[Stoic physics]] are largely drawn from the teachings of the philosopher [[Heraclitus]]. Stoicism is predominantly a philosophy of personal ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for humans is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or fear of pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to do one’s part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and justly.

The Stoics are especially known for teaching that "virtue is the only good" for human beings, and that external things—such as health, wealth, and pleasure—are not good or bad in themselves, but have value as "material for virtue to act upon".  Alongside [[Aristotelian ethics]], the Stoic tradition forms one of the major founding approaches to Western [[virtue ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, Matthew. "[http://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30059463/sharpe-stoicvirtue-2013.pdf Stoic Virtue Ethics]." ''Handbook of Virtue Ethics'', 2013, 28–41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stoics also held that certain destructive emotions resulted from errors of judgment, and they believed people should aim to maintain a will (called ''[[prohairesis]]'') that is "in accord with nature". Because of this, the Stoics thought the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said, but how a person behaved.&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars. ''Stoicism'', 2006, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they thought everything was rooted in nature.

Many Stoics—such as [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Epictetus]]—emphasized that because "virtue is sufficient for [[Philosophy of happiness|happiness]]", a [[Sage (philosophy)|sage]] would be emotionally resilient to misfortune. This belief is similar to the meaning of the phrase "stoic calm", though the phrase does not include the "radical ethical" Stoic views that only a sage can be considered truly free, and that all moral corruptions are equally vicious.&lt;ref name="Stoicism"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoicism], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Stoicism flourished throughout the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Roman Greece|Greek]] world until the 3rd century AD, and among its adherents was Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]]. It experienced a decline after Christianity became the state religion in the 4th century AD. Since then it has seen revivals, notably in the [[Renaissance philosophy|Renaissance]] ([[Neostoicism]]) and in the contemporary era ([[modern Stoicism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Becker|first1=Lawrence C.|author-link=Lawrence C. Becker|title=A New Stoicism|date=2001|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton|isbn=9781400822447|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NbqFt3RPsuQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Stoic comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''stōïkos'', meaning "of the stoa [portico, or porch]". This, in turn, refers to the [[Stoa Poikile]], or "Painted Stoa," in Athens, where the influential Stoic [[Zeno of Citium]] taught.&lt;ref name="etymologymerriam"&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stoic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williamson2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=D.|title=Kant's Theory of Emotion: Emotional Universalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=62WCDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17|date=1 April 2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=978-1-137-49810-6|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In laymen's terms stoicism is sometimes referred to as "suffering in silence", and the ethics associated with that.&lt;ref&gt;Yong, Hua‐Hie. "Can attitudes of stoicism and cautiousness explain observed age‐related variation in levels of self‐rated pain, mood disturbance and functional interference in chronic pain patients?." European Journal of Pain 10.5 (2006): 399–399.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic tenets==
{{rquote|right|Philosophy does not promise to secure anything external for man, otherwise it would be admitting something that lies beyond its proper subject-matter. For as the material of the carpenter is wood, and that of statuary bronze, so the subject-matter of the art of living is each person's own life.|Epictetus|''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]]'' 1.15.2, Robin Hard revised translation}}

The Stoics provided a unified account of the world, consisting of formal [[logic]], [[monism|monistic]] [[physics]] and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] ethics. Of these, they emphasized ethics as the main focus of human knowledge, though their logical theories were of more interest for later philosophers.

Stoicism teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive [[emotion]]s; the philosophy holds that becoming a clear and unbiased thinker allows one to understand the universal reason (''[[logos]]''). A primary aspect of Stoicism involves improving the individual's ethical and moral well-being: "''Virtue'' consists in a ''will'' that is in agreement with Nature."&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''A History of Western Philosophy,'' p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; This principle also applies to the realm of interpersonal relationships; "to be free from anger, envy, and jealousy,"&lt;ref name="Russell1"&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''A History of Western Philosophy'', p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; and to accept even slaves as "equals of other men, because all men alike are products of nature".&lt;ref name="Russell5"&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''A History of Western Philosophy'', p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stoic ethic espouses a [[determinism|deterministic]] perspective; in regard to those who lack Stoic virtue, [[Cleanthes]] once opined that the wicked man is "like a dog tied to a cart, and compelled to go wherever it goes".&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; A Stoic of virtue, by contrast, would amend his will to suit the world and remain, in the words of Epictetus, "sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy,"&lt;ref name="Russell1" /&gt; thus positing a "completely autonomous" individual will, and at the same time a universe that is "a rigidly deterministic single whole".  This viewpoint was later described as "[[Classical Pantheism]]" (and was adopted by Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]]).&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hartshorne and William Reese, "Philosophers Speak of God," Humanity Books, 1953 ch 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antisthenes Pio-Clementino Inv288.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Antisthenes]], founder of the Cynic school of philosophy]]

Stoicism became the foremost popular philosophy among the educated elite in the Hellenistic world and the Roman Empire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=These Were the Greeks|last=Amos|first=H.|publisher=Dufour Editions|year=1982|isbn=978-0-8023-1275-4|location=Chester Springs|oclc=9048254}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the point where, in the words of [[Gilbert Murray]] "nearly all the [[diadochi|successors of Alexander]] [...] professed themselves Stoics."&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Murray, ''The Stoic Philosophy'' (1915), p. 25. In Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'' (1946).&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning around 301&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] taught philosophy at the Stoa Poikile ("Painted Porch"), from which his philosophy got its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Becker | first = Lawrence | title = A History of Western Ethics | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-415-96825-6 |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the other schools of philosophy, such as the [[Epicureans]], Zeno chose to teach his philosophy in a public space, which was a [[colonnade]] overlooking the central gathering place of Athens, the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]].

Zeno's ideas developed from those of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], whose founding father, [[Antisthenes]], had been a disciple of [[Socrates]]. Zeno's most influential follower was [[Chrysippus]], who was responsible for the molding of what is now called Stoicism. Later Roman Stoics focused on promoting a life in harmony within the universe, over which one has no direct control.

[[File:Seneca-berlinantikensammlung-1.jpg|thumb|right|Bust of Seneca]] 
Scholars usually divide the history of Stoicism into three phases:
* Early Stoa, from the founding of the school by Zeno to [[Antipater of Tarsus|Antipater]].
* Middle Stoa, including [[Panaetius]] and [[Posidonius]].
* Late Stoa, including [[Gaius Musonius Rufus|Musonius Rufus]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Epictetus]], and [[Marcus Aurelius]].

No complete work by any Stoic philosopher survives from the first two phases of Stoicism. Only Roman texts from the Late Stoa survive.&lt;ref&gt;A.A.Long, ''Hellenistic Philosophy'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logic==
{{Main|Stoic logic}}
===Propositional logic===
[[Diodorus Cronus]], who was one of Zeno's teachers, is considered the philosopher who first introduced and developed an approach to logic now known as [[propositional logic]], which is based on statements or propositions, rather than terms, making it very different from Aristotle's [[term logic]]. Later, [[Chrysippus]] developed a system that became known as Stoic logic and included a deductive system, Stoic Syllogistic, which was considered a rival to Aristotle's Syllogistic (see [[Syllogism]]). New interest in Stoic logic came in the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, when important developments in logic were based on propositional logic. [[Susanne Bobzien]] wrote, "The many close similarities between Chrysippus' philosophical logic and that of [[Gottlob Frege]] are especially striking."&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/ ''Ancient Logic''] by [[Susanne Bobzien]]. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bobzien also notes that "Chrysippus wrote over 300 books on logic, on virtually any topic logic today concerns itself with, including [[speech act]] theory, sentence analysis, singular and plural expressions, types of [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]], [[Indexicality|indexicals]], [[Existential quantification|existential propositions]], [[Logical connective|sentential connectives]], [[negation]]s, [[Logical disjunction|disjunctions]], [[Conditional proof|conditionals]], [[logical consequence]], [[validity (logic)|valid argument]] forms, [[Deductive reasoning|theory of deduction]], propositional logic, [[modal logic]], [[tense logic]], [[epistemic logic]], [[Supposition theory|logic of suppositions]], [[Imperative logic|logic of imperatives]], ambiguity and logical [[paradox]]es."&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;

===Categories===
{{Main article|Stoic categories}}

The Stoics held that all [[being]] (ὄντα) – though not all things (τινά) – is [[Matter|material]]. They accepted the distinction between [[Abstract and concrete]] bodies, but rejected [[Aristotle]]'s belief that purely [[incorporeality|incorporeal]] being exists. Thus, they accepted [[Anaxagoras]]' idea (as did Aristotle) that if an object is hot, it is because some part of a universal heat body had entered the object. But, unlike Aristotle, they extended the idea to cover all [[Accident (philosophy)|accidents]]. Thus if an object is red, it would be because some part of a universal red body had entered the object.

They held that there were four [[Stoic categories|categories]].
* '''[[Substance theory|substance]] (ὑποκείμενον)'''
::The primary matter, formless substance, (''ousia'') that things are made of
* '''[[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] (ποιόν)'''
::The way matter is organized to form an individual object; in Stoic physics, a physical ingredient (''pneuma'': air or breath), which informs the matter
*'''somehow disposed (πως ἔχον)'''
::Particular characteristics, not present within the object, such as size, shape, action, and posture{{Rquote|right|Make for yourself a definition or description of the thing which is presented to you, so as to see distinctly what kind of a thing it is in its substance, in its nudity, in its complete entirety, and tell yourself its proper name, and the names of the things of which it has been compounded, and into which it will be resolved. For nothing is so productive of elevation of mind as to be able to examine methodically and truly every object that is presented to you in life, and always to look at things so as to see at the same time what kind of universe this is, and what kind of use everything performs in it, and what value everything has with reference to the whole.|Marcus Aurelius|''[[Meditations]]'', iii. 11}}
*'''Somehow disposed in relation to something (πρός τί πως ἔχον)'''
::Characteristics related to other phenomena, such as the position of an object within time and space relative to other objects

===Epistemology===
The Stoics propounded that [[knowledge]] can be attained through the use of [[reason]]. [[Truth]] can be distinguished from [[fallacy]]—even if, in practice, only an approximation can be made. According to the Stoics, the [[sense]]s constantly receive sensations: pulsations that pass from objects through the senses to the [[mind]], where they leave an impression in the [[imagination]] (phantasia) (an impression arising from the mind was called a phantasma).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Diogenes Laërtius | author-link = Diogenes Laërtius | year = 2000 | title = Lives of eminent philosophers | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | location = Cambridge, MA}} VII.49&lt;/ref&gt;

The mind has the ability to judge (συγκατάθεσις, ''synkatathesis'')—approve or reject—an impression, enabling it to distinguish a true representation of reality from one that is false. Some impressions can be assented to immediately, but others can only achieve varying degrees of hesitant approval, which can be labeled [[belief]] or opinion (''[[doxa]]''). It is only through reason that we gain clear comprehension and conviction (''[[katalepsis]]''). [[Certain]] and true knowledge (''[[episteme]]''), achievable by the Stoic sage, can be attained only by verifying the conviction with the expertise of one's peers and the collective judgment of humankind.

==Metaphysics==
The first philosophers to explicitly describe [[Nominalism|nominalist]] arguments were the Stoics, especially Chrysippus.&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', Routledge, 2014, pp. 84–85: "[Stoics] have often been presented as the first nominalists, rejecting the existence of universal concepts altogether. ... For Chrysippus there are no universal entities, whether they be conceived as substantial [[Platonic Forms]] or in some other manner.".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/chrysipp/ Chrysippus – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics, theology and cosmology==
{{main article|Stoic physics}}
{{See also|De Mundo}}
According to the Stoics, the [[Universe]] is a material, reasoning substance, known as God or [[Nature]], which the Stoics divided into two classes, the active and the passive. The passive substance is matter, which "lies sluggish, a substance ready for any use, but sure to remain unemployed if no one sets it in motion".&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Epistles'', lxv. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The active substance, which can be called [[Destiny|Fate]] or Universal Reason (''Logos''), is an intelligent [[Aether (classical element)|aether]] or primordial fire, which acts on the passive matter:
{{quote|The universe itself is God and the universal outpouring of its soul; it is this same world's guiding principle, operating in mind and reason, together with the common nature of things and the totality that embraces all existence; then the foreordained might and necessity of the future; then fire and the principle of aether; then those elements whose natural state is one of flux and transition, such as water, earth, and air; then the sun, the moon, the stars; and the universal existence in which all things are contained.|sign=Chrysippus|source=in Cicero, ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'', i. 39}}

Everything is subject to the laws of Fate, for the Universe acts according to its own nature, and the nature of the passive matter it governs. The [[soul]]s of humans and animals are emanations from this primordial Fire, and are, likewise, subject to Fate:

{{quote|Constantly regard the universe as one living being, having one substance and one soul; and observe how all things have reference to one perception, the perception of this one living being; and how all things act with one movement; and how all things are the cooperating causes of all things that exist; observe too the continuous spinning of the thread and the structure of the web.|sign=Marcus Aurelius|source=''[[Meditations]]'', iv. 40}}

Individual souls are perishable by nature, and can be "transmuted and diffused, assuming a fiery nature by being received into the ''seminal reason'' ("[[logos spermatikos]]") of the Universe".&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Aurelius, ''Meditations'', iv. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Since right Reason is the foundation of both humanity and the universe, it follows that the goal of life is to live according to Reason, that is, to live a life according to [[Natural law|Nature]].

Stoic theology is a [[Fatalism|fatalistic]] and [[naturalistic pantheism]]: God is never fully transcendent but always [[Immanence|immanent]], and identified with [[Nature]]. [[Abrahamic religions]] personalize God as a world-creating entity, but Stoicism equates God with the totality of the universe; according to Stoic [[cosmology]], which is very similar to the [[Hindu cosmology|Hindu conception of existence]], there is no absolute start to time, as it is considered infinite and cyclic. Similarly, the [[space]] and [[Universe]] have neither start nor end, rather they are cyclical. The current Universe is a phase in the present cycle, preceded by an infinite number of Universes, doomed to be destroyed ("[[Ekpyrosis|ekpyrōsis]]", ''conflagration'') and [[Palingenesis|re-created again]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Lapidge]], ''Stoic Cosmology'', in: John M. Rist, ''The Stoics'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1978, pp. 182–183.&lt;/ref&gt; and to be followed by another infinite number of Universes. Stoicism considers all [[existence]] as cyclic, the cosmos as eternally self-creating and self-destroying (see also [[Eternal return]]).

Stoicism, just like [[Indian religions]] such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], does not posit a beginning or end to the Universe.&lt;ref name="ferg" /&gt; According to the Stoics, the ''[[logos]]'' was the active [[reason]] or ''[[anima mundi]]'' pervading and animating the entire Universe. It was conceived as material and is usually identified with God or Nature. The Stoics also referred to the ''seminal reason'' ("[[logos spermatikos]]"), or the law of generation in the Universe, which was the principle of the active reason working in inanimate [[matter]]. Humans, too, each possess a portion of the divine ''logos'', which is the primordial Fire and reason that controls and sustains the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;Tripolitis, A., ''Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman Age'', pp. 37–38. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics and virtues&lt;!--linked from 'Zeno of Citium' and 'Oikeiôsis'--&gt;==
The ancient Stoics are often misunderstood because the terms they used pertained to different concepts in the past than they do today. The word "stoic" has come to mean "unemotional" or indifferent to pain because Stoic ethics taught freedom from "passion" by following "reason". The Stoics did not seek to extinguish emotions; rather, they sought to transform them by a resolute "[[asceticism|askēsis]]" that enables a person to develop clear judgment and inner calm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Graver | first = Margaret | title = Stoicism and Emotion | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] | location = Chicago | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-226-30558-5 |oclc=430497127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Logic, reflection, and concentration were the methods of such self-discipline.

Borrowing from the Cynics, the foundation of Stoic ethics is that good lies in the state of the soul itself; in wisdom and self-control. Stoic ethics stressed the rule: "Follow where reason leads." {{citationneeded|date=June 2017}} One must therefore strive to be free of the [[Stoic passions|passions]], bearing in mind that the ancient meaning of "passion" was "anguish" or "suffering",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/passion |website=[[Merriam-Webster]] |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Passion |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, "passively" reacting to external events, which is somewhat different from the modern use of the word. A distinction was made between ''pathos'' (plural ''pathe'') which is normally translated as ''passion'', ''propathos'' or instinctive reaction (e.g., turning pale and trembling when confronted by physical danger) and ''eupathos'', which is the mark of the Stoic sage (''sophos''). The ''eupatheia'' are feelings that result from correct judgment in the same way that passions result from incorrect judgment.

The idea was to be free of [[suffering]] through ''[[apatheia]]'' (Greek: {{lang|grc|ἀπάθεια}}; literally, "without passion") or [[Inner peace|peace of mind]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Seddon | first = Keith | title = Epictetus' Handbook and the Tablet of Cebes | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-415-32451-9 |page=217 |oclc=469313282}}&lt;/ref&gt; where peace of mind was understood in the ancient sense—being [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] or having "clear judgment" and the maintenance of [[equanimity]] in the face of life's highs and lows.

For the Stoics, reason meant not only using logic, but also understanding the processes of nature—the logos or universal reason, inherent in all things. Living according to reason and virtue, they held, is to live in harmony with the divine order of the universe, in recognition of the common reason and essential value of all people.

The four [[cardinal virtues]] (''[[Arete (moral virtue)|aretai]]'') of Stoic philosophy is a classification derived from the teachings of [[Plato]] (''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' IV. 426–435):
* [[Wisdom]] (σοφία "''sophia''")
* [[Courage]] (ανδρεία "''andreia''")
* [[Justice]] (δικαιοσύνη "''dikaiosyne''")
* [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]] (σωφροσύνη ''"[[sophrosyne]]''")

Following Socrates, the Stoics held that unhappiness and [[evil]] are the results of human ignorance of the reason in nature. If someone is unkind, it is because they are unaware of their own universal reason, which leads to the conclusion of unkindness. The solution to evil and unhappiness then is the practice of Stoic philosophy: to examine one's own judgments and behavior and determine where they diverge from the universal reason of nature.

The Stoics accepted that suicide was permissible for the wise person in circumstances that might prevent them from living a virtuous life.&lt;ref name="marietta153"&gt;Don E. Marietta, (1998), ''Introduction to ancient philosophy'', pp. 153–54. Sharpe&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plutarch]] held that accepting life under tyranny would have compromised [[Cato the Younger|Cato]]'s self-consistency (''constantia'') as a Stoic and impaired his freedom to make the honorable moral choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Cato's suicide in Plutarch AV Zadorojnyi|publisher=The Classical Quarterly|year=2007|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0009838807000195|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===The doctrine of "things indifferent"===
{{main article|Apatheia}}
{{see also|Eudaimonia}}
In philosophical terms, things that are indifferent are outside the application of [[Moral absolutism|moral law]]—that is without tendency to either promote or obstruct moral ends. Actions neither required nor forbidden by the moral law, or that do not affect [[morality]], are called morally indifferent. The doctrine of things indifferent ({{lang|grc|ἀδιάφορα}}, ''[[adiaphora]]'') arose in the Stoic school as a [[corollary]] of its diametric opposition of virtue and vice ({{lang|grc|καθήκοντα}} ''[[kathekon]]'', "convenient actions", or actions in accordance with nature; and ἁμαρτήματα ''hamartemata'', mistakes). As a result of this [[dichotomy]], a large class of objects were left unassigned and thus regarded as indifferent.

Eventually three sub-classes of "things indifferent" developed: things to prefer because they assist life according to nature; things to avoid because they hinder it; and things indifferent in the narrower sense. The principle of ''adiaphora'' was also common to the Cynics. [[Philipp Melanchthon]] revived the doctrine of things indifferent during the [[Renaissance]].

===Spiritual exercise===
[[File:L'Image et le Pouvoir - Buste cuirassé de Marc Aurèle agé - 3.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Marcus Aurelius]], the Stoic Roman emperor]]
Philosophy for a Stoic is not just a set of beliefs or ethical claims, it is a way of life involving constant practice and training (or "[[asceticism|askēsis]]"). Stoic philosophical and spiritual practices included [[History of logic#Stoics|logic]], [[Socratic dialogue]] and [[Introspection|self-dialogue]], [[Mortality salience|contemplation of death]], training attention to remain in the present moment (similar to some forms of [[Buddhist meditation]]), and daily reflection on everyday problems and possible solutions. Philosophy for a Stoic is an active process of constant practice and self-reminder.

In his ''[[Meditations]]'', Marcus Aurelius defines several such practices. For example, in Book II.I:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Say to yourself in the early morning: I shall meet today ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable men. All of the ignorance of real good and ill... I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him; for we have come into the world to work together...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prior to Aurelius, Epictetus in his ''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]],'' distinguished between three types of act: judgment, desire, and inclination.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, A.I. (1995) ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'', in ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', Hadot, P. Oxford Blackwells, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; According to French philosopher [[Pierre Hadot]], Epictetus identifies these three acts with logic, physics and ethics respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Hadot, P. (1992) ''La Citadelle intérieure. Introduction aux Pensées de Marc Aurèle''. Paris, Fayard, pp. 106–15&lt;/ref&gt; Hadot writes that in the ''Meditations'', "Each maxim develops either one of these very characteristic ''topoi'' [i.e., acts], or two of them or three of them."&lt;ref&gt;Hadot, P. (1987) ''Exercices spirituels et philosophie antique''. Paris, 2nd ed., p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seamus Mac Suibhne has described the practices of spiritual exercises as influencing those of [[reflective practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mac Suibhne, S.|year=2009|title='Wrestle to be the man philosophy wished to make you': Marcus Aurelius, reflective practitioner|journal=Reflective Practice|volume=10|issue=4|pages=429–36|doi=10.1080/14623940903138266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson's ''The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy'' details at length parallels between Stoic spiritual exercises and modern [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].&lt;ref name="Robertson_2010"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Robertson, D | title=The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy: Stoicism as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy| year=2010| publisher=Karnac| location=London| isbn=978-1-85575-756-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsOFyJaR5vEC&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoics were also known for consolatory orations, which were part of the ''[[consolatio]]'' literary tradition.  Three such [[Seneca's Consolations|consolations]] by Seneca have survived.

==Social philosophy==
A distinctive feature of Stoicism is its [[cosmopolitanism]]: All people are manifestations of the one universal spirit and should live in brotherly love and readily help one another according to the Stoics. In the ''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]]'', [[Epictetus]] comments on man's relationship with the world: "Each human being is primarily a citizen of his own commonwealth; but he is also a member of the great city of gods and men, whereof the city political is only a copy."&lt;ref&gt;Epictetus, ''Discourses'', ii. 5. 26&lt;/ref&gt; This sentiment echoes that of [[Diogenes of Sinope]], who said, "I am not an [[Athens, Greece|Athenian]] or a [[Ancient Corinth|Corinthian]], but a citizen of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Epictetus, ''Discourses'', i. 9. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

They held that external differences such as rank and wealth are of no importance in social relationships. Instead, they advocated the brotherhood of humanity and the natural equality of all human beings. Stoicism became the most influential school of the Greco-Roman world, and produced a number of remarkable writers and personalities, such as [[Cato the Younger]] and Epictetus.

In particular, they were noted for their urging of [[clemency]] toward [[slave]]s. Seneca exhorted, "Kindly remember that he whom you call your slave sprang from the same stock, is smiled upon by the same skies, and on equal terms with yourself breathes, lives, and dies."&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[s:Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 47|''Moral letters to Lucilius'', Letter 47: ''On master and slave'']], 10, circa AD 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on Christianity==
{{See also|Neostoicism}}
[[Image:Justus Lipsius.png|right|thumb|[[Justus Lipsius]], founder of Neostoicism]]
In his introduction to the 1964 [[Penguin Classics]] edition of ''Meditations'', the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth discussed the profound impact Stoicism had on Christianity. He claimed the author of the Fourth Gospel declared Christ to be the Logos, which "had long been one of the leading terms of Stoicism, chosen originally for the purpose of explaining how deity came into relation with the universe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=24 |isbn=978-0-140-44140-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In St. Ambrose of Milan's ''Duties'', "The voice is the voice of a Christian bishop, but the precepts are those of [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3401.htm|title=On the Duties of the Clergy|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aurelius |first=Marcus |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=26 |isbn=978-0-140-44140-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding what he called "the Divine Spirit", Stanisforth wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Cleanthes, wishing to give more explicit meaning to Zeno's 'creative fire', had been the first to hit upon the term ''pneuma'', or 'spirit', to describe it. Like fire, this intelligent 'spirit' was imagined as a tenuous substance akin to a current of air or breath, but essentially possessing the quality of warmth; it was immanent in the universe as God, and in man as the soul and life-giving principle. Clearly it is not a long step from this to the 'Holy Spirit' of Christian theology, the 'Lord and Giver of life', visibly manifested as tongues of fire at Pentecost and ever since associated—in the Christian as in the Stoic mind—with the ideas of vital fire and beneficient warmth.&lt;ref name="Marcus Aurelius 1964 25"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=25 |isbn=978-0-140-44140-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding the [[Trinity]], Staniforth wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Again in the doctrine of the Trinity, the ecclesiastical conception of Father, Word, and Spirit finds its germ in the different Stoic names of the Divine Unity. Thus Seneca, writing of the supreme Power which shapes the universe, states, 'This Power we sometimes call the All-ruling God, sometimes the incorporeal Wisdom, sometimes the holy Spirit, sometimes Destiny.' The Church had only to reject the last of these terms to arrive at its own acceptable definition of the Divine Nature; while the further assertion 'these three are One', which the modern mind finds paradoxical, was no more than commonplace to those familiar with Stoic notions.&lt;ref name="Marcus Aurelius 1964 25"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Paul of Tarsus|apostle Paul]] met with Stoics during his stay in Athens, reported in {{bibleverse||Acts|17:16–18|NKJV}}. In his [[Pauline epistles|letters]], Paul reflected heavily from his knowledge of Stoic philosophy, using Stoic terms and metaphors to assist his new [[Gentile]] converts in their understanding of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Kee, Howard and Franklin W. Young, ''Understanding The New Testament'', Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, Prentice Hall, Inc. 1958, p. 208. {{ISBN|978-0139365911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stoic influence can also be seen in the works of [[St. Ambrose]], [[Marcus Minucius Felix]], and [[Tertullian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/Stoicism Encyclopædia Britannica. Stoicism. §''Stoic elements in Pauline and patristic thought'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fathers of the Church]] regarded Stoicism as a "pagan philosophy";&lt;ref name="Agathias"&gt;[[Agathias]]. ''Histories,'' 2.31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sedley"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=David |first=Sedley |editor=E. Craig |encyclopedia=[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |title=Ancient philosophy |url=http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/A130 |accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; nonetheless, early Christian writers employed some of the central philosophical concepts of Stoicism. Examples include the terms "logos", "[[virtue]]", "[[Spirit]]", and "[[conscience]]".&lt;ref name="ferg"&gt;Ferguson, Everett. ''Backgrounds of Early Christianity''. 2003, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; But the parallels go well beyond the sharing and borrowing of terminology. Both Stoicism and Christianity assert an inner freedom in the face of the external world, a belief in human kinship with Nature or God, a sense of the innate depravity—or "persistent evil"—of humankind,&lt;ref name="ferg" /&gt; and the futility and temporary nature of worldly possessions and attachments. Both encourage ''Ascesis'' with respect to the passions and inferior emotions such as lust, and envy, so that the higher possibilities of one's humanity can be awakened and developed.

Stoic writings such as ''[[Meditations]]'' by [[Marcus Aurelius]] have been highly regarded by many Christians throughout the centuries. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Oriental Orthodox Church]] accept the Stoic ideal of [[Apatheia|dispassion]] to this day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1158">'''Wagnerism'''  has a number of meanings:

* the [[philosophy|philosophical]] ideals put forward by [[Richard Wagner]] which indicate  the traits of a "true" [[Germany|German]], among other [[aestheticism|aesthetic]] ideas.
* an attachment, sometimes fanatical, to the music of Wagner.
* a form of adversarial [[labour union]] legislation, the [[Wagner Act]] in the [[United States]], and similarly adopted in [[Canada]], among other countries.

The first two of these aspects were promoted, often in distorted form, by the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime in Germany. [[Adolf Hitler]] argued that "Germany would be impossible without Wagner and all he represents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1125&amp;context=manuscripts |title=Hitler and Wagnerism |author=Janet Gregory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Hansen, Chad. (1983). (see above). There are no articles in Chinese, so the nouns must be read as collectives, mass nouns or plurals. The argument is about the use of terms hence belongs to the school of names. It is not about the color of horses.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13196">'''When A White Horse Is Not A Horse''' ({{zh|c=白馬非馬|p=''Báimǎ fēi mǎ''|w=''Pai-ma fei ma''|l=white horse not horse}}), also known as the '''White Horse Dialogue''' ({{zh|c=白馬論|p=''Báimǎ Lùn''|w=''Pai-ma Lun''|l=white horse discourse}}), is a famous paradox in [[Chinese philosophy]]. [[Gongsun Long]] wrote this circa 300 BC dialectic analysis of the question 'Is "white horse not horse" permissibly assertible?'.

==The original text==
[[File:Cabalo044eue.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Is it a horse?]]
The White Horse Dialogue (''Baima Lun'') constitutes chapter 2 of the [[eponymous]] ''Gongsun Longzi'' "Master Gongsun Long", who was counted among the "[[School of Names]]" (aka "Logicians" or "Dialecticians") in the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]]. Most of Gongsun's writings have been lost and the received ''Gongsun Longzi'' text only contains 6 of the supposedly 14 original chapters. Parts of the text are dislocated and some commentators and translators rearrange them for clarity. The dialogue is between two unnamed speakers.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Is "{{zh|c=白馬非馬|p=''Báimǎ fēi mǎ''|l=white horse not horse}}" assertible?&lt;br /&gt;

Advocate: It is.&lt;br /&gt;

Objector: How?&lt;br /&gt;

Advocate: "Horse" is that by means of which one names the shape. "White" is that by means of which one names the color. What names the color is not what names the shape. Hence, one may "white horse not horse."&lt;br /&gt;

Objector: If there are white horses, one cannot say that there are no horses. If one cannot say that there are no horses, doesn't that mean that there are horses? For there to be white horses is for there to be horses. How could it be that the white ones are not horses?&lt;br /&gt;

Advocate: If one wants horses, that extends to yellow or black horses. But if one wants white horses, that does not extend to a yellow or black horses. Suppose that white horses were horses. Then what one wants [in the two cases] would be the same. If what one wants were the same, then 'white' would not differ from 'horse.' If what one wants does not differ, then how is it that yellow or black horses are acceptable in one case and unacceptable in the other case? It is clear that acceptable and unacceptable are mutually contrary. Hence, yellow and black horses are the same, one can respond that there are horses, but one cannot respond that there are white horses. Thus, it is evident that white horses are not horses.&lt;ref name="readings"&gt;[[Gongsun Long]]zi. (2005). {{Google books|5PL9hSUiVEoC|''Readings in Classical Chinese Philosophy,'' pp. 364–365|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This dialogue continues with deliberations over colored and colorless horses and whether "white" and "horse" can be separated from "white horse".

Other ''Gongsun longzi'' chapters discuss ''Baima''-related concepts of ''jian'' [[Wikt:堅|堅]] "hard; hardness" and ''bai'' [[Wikt:白|白]] "white; whiteness", ''ming'' [[Wikt:名|名]] "name; term" and ''shi'' [[Wikt:實|實]] "solid; true, actual; fact, reality", and abstract ''zhi'' [[Wikt:指|指]] "finger; pointing; designation; [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]]" like "whiteness" and concrete ''wu'' [[Wikt:物|物]] "thing; object; [[particular]]" like a "white horse".

==Difficulties of interpretation==
The Chinese of "a white horse is not a horse" is ''bai ma fei ma'' 白馬非馬, whose meaning hinges upon the [[Negation (rhetoric)|negative]] ''fei'' [[Wikt:非|非]] "not, is not; no, negative; oppose; wrong". The Classical construction "A ''fei'' B" "A非B" can ambiguously mean either "A is not a member of the class B" or "A is not identical to B".&lt;ref name="Graham-studies334"&gt;Graham, Angus Charles. (1990). {{google books|TD43k809CT8C|''Studies in Chinese Philosophy and Philosophical Literature,'' p. 334.|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpreting this [[equivocation]] fallacy, [[A.C. Graham]] says this "white horse" vs. "horse" paradox plays upon the ambiguity of whether "is" means:
# "Is a member of the [[Class (philosophy)|class]] (x)"
# "Is identical to  (x)"&lt;ref name="Graham-studies334"/&gt;

In other words, the expression "a white horse is not a horse" is ambiguous between "a white horse is not identical with a horse" (true, because "white horse" is more specific than "horse"), and "a white horse is not a member of the set of horses" (obviously false). The Advocate in the dialogue is asserting that "a white horse is not [identical with] a horse," while the Objector is interpreting the Advocate's statement as "a white horse is not [a member of the group of] horses."

An illustration of the alternative uses of "fei" may be found in the widely known "Happiness of Fish" dialogue in ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' (17, tr. Watson 1968:188-9). Huizi says "You're not a fish [子非魚] &amp;mdash; how do you know what fish enjoy?" (denying that Zhuangzi is a member of the class of fish) and Zhuangzi replies "You're not I [子非我], so how do you know I don't know what fish enjoy?" (denying that the individuals Huizi and Zhuangzi are identical).

Beyond the inherent semantic ambiguities of ''Baima fei ma'', the first line obscurely asks ''ke hu'' [[Wikt:可|可]][[Wikt:乎|乎]] "Can it be that …?". This dialogue could be an attempted proof that a white horse is not a horse, or a question if such a statement is possible, or both. [[Bryan W. Van Norden]] suggests that "the Advocate is only arguing that 'a white horse is not a horse' ''could'' be true, given a certain interpretation. He might acknowledge that, in another interpretation, 'a white horse ''is'' a horse.' "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Norden|first1=Bryan|title=Introduction to Classical Chinese Philosophy|date=2011|publisher=Hackett Publishing Company|location=Indianapolis|isbn=9781603844680|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative interpretation is offered in [[Feng Youlan]]'s ''History of Chinese Philosophy ''(translated in 1952 by [[Derk Bodde]]):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Strictly speaking, names or terms are divided into those that are abstract and those that are concrete. The abstract term denotes the universal, the concrete term the particular. The particular is the denotation, and the universal the connotation, of the term. In western inflected languages there is no difficulty in distinguishing between the particular ('white' or 'horse') and the abstract ('whiteness' or 'horseness'). In Chinese, however, owing to the fact that the written characters are ideographic and pictorial and lack all inflection, there is no possible way, as far as the form of individual words is concerned, of distinguishing between abstract and concrete terms. Thus in Chinese the word designating a particular horse and that designating the universal, 'horseness,' are written and pronounced in the same way. Similarly with other terms, so that such words as 'horse' and 'white', being used to designate both the concrete particular and the abstract universal, thus hold two values.&lt;ref&gt;Fung Yu-lan. (1953). ''A History of Chinese Philosophy,'' p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, there are no contemporary histories of Chinese philosophy that subscribe to [[Feng Youlan]]'s interpretation. Other philosophers and sinologists who have analyzed the dialogue include Graham,&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Angus Charles. (1989). ''Disputers of the Tao: Philosophical Argument in Ancient China,'' pp.75-95;  Graham, (1990). {{Google books|TD43k809CT8C|''Studies,'' pp. 125–216.|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen,&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Chad. 1976. "Mass Nouns and 'A White Horse Is Not a Horse'", ''[[Philosophy East and West]],'' 26.2:189-209; Hansen, Chad. (1983). ''Language and Logic in Ancient China,'' p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Harbsmeier,&lt;ref&gt;Harbsmeier, Christoph. (1998). "Language and Logic in Traditional China". Volume 7, Part I of ''Science and Civilisation in China,'' pp. 298–321.&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Kirill Ole. 1995. "When a 'White Horse' Is Not a 'Horse'", ''Philosophy East and West'' 45.4:481-499.&lt;/ref&gt; and Van Norden.&lt;ref name="readings"/&gt;

==Historic influence==
In the Chinese philosophical tradition, the ''Baima Lun'''s significance is evident from how many [[Chinese classic texts]] directly or indirectly discuss it. The ''[[Liezi]]'', which lists and criticizes the paradoxes of Gongsun Long as "perversions of reason and sense", explains "'A white horse is not a horse', because the name diverges from the shape."&lt;ref name="Graham-studies80"&gt;Graham, {{Google books|TD43k809CT8C|p. 80.|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' chapters (17 and 33) mock Gongsun Long, and another (2) combines his ''zhi'' 指 "attribute" and ''ma'' 馬 "horse" notions in the same context.
&lt;blockquote&gt;To use an attribute to show that attributes are not attributes is not as good as using a nonattribute to show that attributes are not attributes. To use a horse to show that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a non-horse to show that a horse is not a horse, Heaven and earth are one attribute; the ten thousand things are one horse.&lt;ref&gt;Zhuangzi. (2003). {{Google books|IKLsWSbCAWQC|''Zhuangzi: basic writings,'' p. 35.|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Mengzi'' (6A4) notes that ''bai'' 白 "white" has different connotations whether we are using it to refer to a graying person (who is worthy of respect because of his age) or a white horse (which should be treated like any other animal):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mencius said, 'There is no difference between our pronouncing a white horse to be white and our pronouncing a white man to be white. But is there no difference between the regard with which we acknowledge the age of an old horse and that with which we acknowledge the age of an old man? And what is it which is called righteousness? The fact of a man's being old? Or the fact of our giving honour to his age?'&lt;ref&gt;Legge, James. (1895). {{Google books|4L0TAAAAYAAJ|''The Chinese Classics: a Translation;'' Part 2, ''The Works of Mencius,'' p. 398.|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Other early "A white horse is not a horse" references are found in the ''[[Hanfeizi]]'' (32), ''[[Mozi]]'' (11B), and ''[[Zhanguoce]]'' (4).
