The '''accelerating expansion of the universe''' is the observation that the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion]] of the [[universe]] is such that the velocity at which a distant galaxy is receding from the observer is continuously increasing with time.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170220"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Cosmos Controversy: The Universe Is Expanding, but How Fast? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/science/hubble-constant-universe-expanding-speed.html |date=20 February 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=21 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AM-20170818"&gt;{{cite web |last=Scharping |first=Nathaniel |title=Gravitational Waves Show How Fast The Universe is Expanding |url=http://www.astronomy.com/news/2017/10/gravitational-waves-show-how-fast-the-universe-is-expanding |date=18 October 2017 |website=[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]] |accessdate=18 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ES-20180311"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weaver |first1=Donna |last2=Villard |first2=Ray |title=Measuring universe expansion reveals mystery – Is something unpredicted going on in the depths of space? |url=http://earthsky.org/space/measuring-universe-expansion-reveals-mystery |date=11 March 2018 |website=[[Earth &amp; Sky]] |accessdate=11 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/the-universe/cosmology-and-the-big-bang/104-the-universe/cosmology-and-the-big-bang/expansion-of-the-universe/616-is-the-universe-expanding-faster-than-the-speed-of-light-intermediate|title=Is the universe expanding faster than the speed of light?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accelerated expansion was discovered in 1998, by two independent projects, the [[Supernova Cosmology Project]] and the [[High-Z Supernova Search Team]], which both used distant [[type Ia supernovae]] to measure the acceleration.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15165371 |title=Nobel physics prize honours accelerating universe find |publisher=BBC News |date=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/# |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2011 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |accessdate=2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peebles"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peebles |first1=P.

The distance can then be compared to the supernovae's cosmological [[redshift]], which measures how much the universe has expanded since the supernova occurred.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Hubble law]], which established that the further an object is from us, the faster it is receding.&lt;/ref&gt; The unexpected result was that objects in the universe are moving away from another at an accelerated rate. Cosmologists at the time expected that recession velocity would always be decelerating to the gravitational attraction of the matter in the universe. Three members of these two groups have subsequently been awarded [[Nobel Prize]]s for their discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cosmology |first=Steven |last=Weinberg |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2008 |isbn=9780198526827}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confirmatory evidence has been found in [[baryon acoustic oscillations]], and in analyses of the clustering of galaxies.

The accelerated expansion of the universe is thought to have begun since the universe entered its [[dark-energy-dominated era]] roughly 5&amp;nbsp;billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Frieman"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Frieman |first=Joshua A. |last2=Turner |first2=Michael S. |last3=Huterer |first3=Dragan |year=2008 |title=Dark Energy and the Accelerating Universe |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=385–432 |arxiv=0803.0982 |bibcode=2008ARA&amp;A..46..385F |doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.46.060407.145243}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn |1=&lt;ref name="Frieman" /&gt; Frieman, Turner &amp; Huterer (2008) p. 6: "The Universe has gone through three distinct eras: radiation-dominated, {{math|''z'' ≳ 3000}}; matter-dominated, {{math|3000 ≳ ''z'' ≳ 0.5}}; and dark-energy-dominated, {{math|''z'' ≲ 0.5}}. The evolution of the scale factor is controlled by the dominant energy form: {{math|''a''(''t'') ∝ ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt;(1 + ''w'')}} (for constant {{mvar|w}}). During the radiation-dominated era, {{math|''a''(''t'') ∝ ''t''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;}}; during the matter-dominated era, {{math|''a''(''t'') ∝ ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt;}}; and for the dark energy-dominated era, assuming {{math|''w'' {{=}} −1}}, asymptotically {{math|''a''(''t'') ∝ exp(''Ht'')}}."&lt;br /&gt;
p. 44: "Taken together, all the current data provide strong evidence for the existence of dark energy; they constrain the fraction of critical density contributed by dark energy, 0.76&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.02, and the equation-of-state parameter, {{mvar|w}}&amp;nbsp;≈ −1&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.1 (stat) ±&amp;nbsp;0.1 (sys), assuming that {{mvar|w}} is constant.

These results are robust – data from any one method can be removed without compromising the constraints – and they are not substantially weakened by dropping the assumption of spatial flatness."|group="notes"}}
Within the framework of [[general relativity]], an accelerated expansion can be accounted for by a positive value of the [[cosmological constant]] {{mvar|Λ}}, equivalent to the presence of a positive [[vacuum energy]], dubbed "[[dark energy]]". While there are alternative possible explanations, the description assuming dark energy (positive {{mvar|Λ}}) is used in the current standard model of [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], which also includes [[cold dark matter]] (CDM) and is known as the [[Lambda-CDM model]].

==Background==
{{Nature timeline}}
{{further|Cosmological constant|Lambda-CDM model|Hubble's law|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann equations}}
In the decades since the detection of [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) in 1965,&lt;ref name="Penzias&amp;Wilson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Penzias |first=A. A. |last2=Wilson |first2=R. W. |date=1965 |title=A Measurement of Excess Antenna Temperature at 4080&amp;nbsp;Mc/s |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=142 |issue=1 |pages=419–421 |bibcode=1965ApJ...142..419P |doi=10.1086/148307}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Big Bang]] model has become the most accepted model explaining the evolution of our universe. The [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann equation]] defines how the [[energy]] in the universe drives its expansion.

:&lt;math&gt; H^2={\left ( \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \right )}^2=\frac{8{\pi}G}{3}\rho-\frac{{\Kappa}c^2}{a^2} &lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|Κ}} represents the [[curvature of the universe]], {{math|''a''(''t'')}} is the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]], {{mvar|ρ}} is the total energy density of the universe, and {{mvar|H}} is the [[Hubble parameter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nemiroff |first1=Robert J. |authorlink1=Robert J. Nemiroff |last2=Patla |first2=Bijunath |title=Adventures in Friedmann cosmology: A detailed expansion of the cosmological Friedmann equations |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=265–276 |doi=10.1119/1.2830536 |arxiv=astro-ph/0703739 |bibcode=2008AmJPh..76..265N |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We define a [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]]
:&lt;math&gt; \rho_c=\frac{3H^2}{8{\pi}G} &lt;/math&gt;
and the [[density parameter]]
:&lt;math&gt; \Omega=\frac{\rho}{\rho_c} &lt;/math&gt;

We can then rewrite the Hubble parameter as

:&lt;math&gt; H(a)=H_0 \sqrt{{\Omega_ka^{-2} + \Omega}_ma^{-3} + \Omega_ra^{-4} + \Omega_\mathrm{DE}a^{-3(1+w)}} &lt;/math&gt;

where the four currently hypothesized contributors to the energy density of the universe are [[Shape of the universe|curvature]], [[matter]], [[radiation]] and [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name=Bassett&gt;{{cite book |last=Lapuente |first=P. |chapter=Baryon Acoustic Oscillations |title=Dark Energy: Observational and Theoretical Approaches |location=Cambridge, UK |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2010 |isbn=978-0521518888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the components decreases with the expansion of the universe (increasing scale factor), except perhaps the dark energy term. It is the values of these cosmological parameters which physicists use to determine the acceleration of the universe.

The [[Friedmann equations|acceleration equation]] describes the evolution of the scale factor with time

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\ddot{a}}{a}=-\frac{4{\pi}G}{3}\left( \rho + \frac{3P}{c^2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where the [[pressure]] {{mvar|P}} is defined by the cosmological model chosen. (see [[Accelerating universe#Explanatory models|explanatory models]] below)

Physicists at one time were so assured of the deceleration of the universe's expansion that they introduced a so-called [[deceleration parameter]] {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=Ryden&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Cosmology |last=Ryden |first=Barbara |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=Addison Wesley |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-8053-8912-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=September 2016}} Current observations point towards this deceleration parameter being negative.

===Relation to inflation===
According to the theory of [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]], the very early universe underwent a period of very rapid, quasi-exponential expansion. While the time-scale for this period of expansion was far shorter than that of the current expansion, this was a period of accelerated expansion with some similarities to the current epoch.

===Technical definition===
The definition of "accelerating expansion" is that the second time derivative of the cosmic scale factor, &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a} &lt;/math&gt;, is positive, which implies that the [[deceleration parameter]] is negative. However, note this does &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; imply that the [[Hubble constant|Hubble parameter]] is increasing with time. Since the Hubble parameter is defined as &lt;math&gt; H(t) \equiv \dot{a}(t) / a(t) &lt;/math&gt;, it follows from the definitions that the derivative of the Hubble parameter is given by 

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dH}{dt} = -H^2(1 + q) &lt;/math&gt;

so the Hubble parameter is decreasing with time unless &lt;math&gt; q &lt; -1 &lt;/math&gt;. Observations prefer &lt;math&gt; q \approx -0.55 &lt;/math&gt;, which implies that &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a} &lt;/math&gt; is positive but &lt;math&gt; dH/dt &lt;/math&gt; is negative.  Essentially, this implies that the cosmic recession velocity of any one particular galaxy is increasing with time, but its velocity/distance ratio is still decreasing; thus different galaxies expanding across a sphere of fixed radius cross the sphere more slowly at later times.

It is seen from above that the case of "zero acceleration/deceleration" corresponds to &lt;math&gt; a(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a linear function of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; q = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \dot{a} = const&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; H(t) = 1/t &lt;/math&gt;.

==Evidence for acceleration==
To learn about the rate of expansion of the universe we look at the [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]]-redshift relationship of astronomical objects using [[Cosmic distance ladder#Standard candles|standard candles]], or their distance-redshift relationship using [[standard ruler]]s. We can also look at the growth of [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]], and find that the observed values of the cosmological parameters are best described by models which include an accelerating expansion.

===Supernova observation===
[[File:Asymmetric Ashes (artist's impression).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Artist's impression of a Type Ia supernova, as revealed by spectro-polarimetry observations]]
The first evidence for acceleration came from the observation of [[Type Ia supernova]]e, which are exploding [[white dwarf]]s that have exceeded their [[Chandrasekhar limit|stability limit]]. Because they all have similar masses, their intrinsic [[luminosity]] is standardizable. Repeated imaging of selected areas of the sky is used to discover the supernovae, then follow-up observations give their peak brightness, which is converted into a quantity known as luminosity distance (see [[distance measures in cosmology]] for details).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |last1=Albrecht|first1=Andreas |display-authors=etal |title=Report of the Dark Energy Task Force |date=2006 |eprint=astro-ph/0609591}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spectral line]]s of their light can be used to determine their [[redshift]].

For supernovae at redshift less than around 0.1, or light travel time less than 10 percent of the age of the universe, this gives a nearly linear distance–redshift relation due to [[Hubble's law]]. At larger distances, since the expansion rate of the universe has changed over time, the distance-redshift relation deviates from linearity, and this deviation depends on how the expansion rate has changed over time. The full calculation requires computer integration of the Friedmann equation, but a simple derivation can be given as follows: the redshift {{mvar|z}} directly gives the [[cosmic scale factor]] at the time the supernova exploded.

:&lt;math&gt; a(t)=\frac{1}{1+z} &lt;/math&gt;

So a supernova with a measured redshift {{math|''z'' {{=}} 0.5}} implies the universe was {{sfrac|1|1 + 0.5}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|2|3}} of its present size when the supernova exploded. In the standard accelerated expansion scenario the rate of expansion still decreases, but does so more slowly than the non-accelerated case. This means that in the accelerated case, the past rate of expansion is slower than it would be in the non-accelerated case.  Thus in a universe with accelerated expansion, it takes a longer time to expand from two thirds its present size, compared to a non-accelerating universe with the same present-day value of the Hubble constant. This results in a larger light-travel time, larger distance and fainter supernovae, which corresponds to the actual observations. [[Adam Riess]] ''et al.'' found that "the distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia were, on average, 10% to 15% farther than expected in a low mass density {{math|''Ω''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0.2}} universe without a cosmological constant".&lt;ref name=Riess&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riess |first1=Adam G. |display-authors=etal |title=Observational Evidence from Supernovae for an Accelerating Universe and a Cosmological Constant |journal=The Astronomical Journal |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=1009–1038 |year=1998 |doi=10.1086/300499 |bibcode=1998AJ....116.1009R |arxiv=astro-ph/9805201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the measured high-redshift distances were too large, compared to nearby ones, for a decelerating universe.&lt;ref name=Pain&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pain |first=Reynald |last2=Astier |first2=Pierre |title=Observational evidence of the accelerated expansion of the Universe |journal=Comptes Rendus Physique |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=521–538 |arxiv=1204.5493 |doi=10.1016/j.crhy.2012.04.009 |date=2012 |bibcode=2012CRPhy..13..521A |citeseerx=10.1.1.747.3792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baryon acoustic oscillations===
{{main|Baryon acoustic oscillations}}
In the early universe before [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]] took place, [[photon]]s and matter existed in a [[Structure formation#Primordial plasma|primordial plasma]]. Points of higher density in the photon-baryon plasma would contract, being compressed by gravity until the pressure became too large and they expanded again.&lt;ref name=Ryden/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2016}} This contraction and expansion created vibrations in the plasma analogous to [[sound waves]]. Since [[dark matter]] only interacts [[gravitationally]] it stayed at the centre of the sound wave, the origin of the original overdensity. When decoupling occurred, approximately 380,000 years after the Big Bang,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hinshaw |first1=G. |year=2009 |title=Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Data Processing, Sky Maps, and Basic Results |doi=10.1088/0067-0049/180/2/225 |journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement |volume=180 |issue=2 |pages=225–245 |arxiv=0803.0732 |bibcode=2009ApJS..180..225H }}&lt;/ref&gt; photons separated from matter and were able to [[free streaming|stream freely]] through the universe, creating the [[cosmic microwave background]] as we know it. This left shells of [[baryonic matter]] at a fixed radius from the overdensities of dark matter, a distance known as the sound horizon. As time passed and the universe expanded, it was at these anisotropies of matter density where galaxies started to form. So by looking at the distances at which galaxies at different redshifts tend to cluster, it is possible to determine a standard [[angular diameter distance]] and use that to compare to the distances predicted by different cosmological models.

Peaks have been found in the correlation function (the probability that two galaxies will be a certain distance apart) at {{nowrap|100 ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; [[Parsec#Megaparsecs and Gigaparsecs|Mpc]]}},&lt;ref name=Bassett/&gt; indicating that this is the size of the sound horizon today, and by comparing this to the sound horizon at the time of decoupling (using the CMB), we can confirm the accelerated expansion of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eisenstein |first1=Daniel J. |display-authors=etal |title=Detection of the Baryon Acoustic Peak in the Large‐Scale Correlation Function of SDSS Luminous Red Galaxies |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |year=2005 |volume=633 |issue=2 |pages=560–574 |doi=10.1086/466512 |bibcode=2005ApJ...633..560E |arxiv=astro-ph/0501171 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clusters of galaxies===
Measuring the mass functions of [[galaxy cluster]]s, which describe the [[number density]] of the clusters above a threshold mass, also provides evidence for dark energy {{explain|date=March 2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dekel |first=Avishai |title=Formation of Structure in the Universe |location=New York, NY |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1999 |isbn=9780521586320}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparing these mass functions at high and low redshifts to those predicted by different cosmological models, values for {{mvar|w}} and {{mvar|Ω&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} are obtained which confirm a low matter density and a non zero amount of dark energy.&lt;ref name=Pain/&gt;

===Age of the universe===
{{see also|Age of the universe}}
Given a cosmological model with certain values of the cosmological density parameters, it is possible to integrate the Friedmann equations and derive the age of the universe.

:&lt;math&gt; t_0=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{da}{\dot{a}} &lt;/math&gt;

By comparing this to actual measured values of the cosmological parameters, we can confirm the validity of a model which is accelerating now, and had a slower expansion in the past.&lt;ref name=Pain/&gt;

==Explanatory models==

===Dark energy===
{{main|Dark energy}}
The most important property of dark energy is that it has negative pressure (repulsive action) which is distributed relatively homogeneously in space.

:&lt;math&gt; P=wc^2\rho &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|c}} is the speed of light and {{mvar|ρ}} is the energy density. Different theories of dark energy suggest different values of {{mvar|w}}, with {{math|''w'' &lt; −{{sfrac|1|3}}}} for cosmic acceleration (this leads to a positive value of {{mvar|ä}} in the [[Accelerating expansion of the universe#Background|acceleration equation]] above).

The simplest explanation for dark energy is that it is a cosmological constant or [[vacuum energy]]; in this case {{math|''w'' {{=}} −1}}. This leads to the [[Lambda-CDM model]], which has generally been known as the Standard Model of Cosmology from 2003 through the present, since it is the simplest model in good agreement with a variety of recent observations. Riess ''et al.'' found that their results from supernovae observations favoured expanding models with positive cosmological constant ({{math|''Ω&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; 0}}) and a current accelerated expansion ({{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0}}).&lt;ref name=Riess/&gt;

===Phantom energy===
{{main|Phantom energy}}
Current observations allow the possibility of a cosmological model containing a dark energy component with equation of state {{math|''w'' &lt; −1}}. This phantom energy density would become infinite in finite time, causing such a huge gravitational repulsion that the universe would lose all structure and end in a [[Big Rip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caldwell |first1=Robert |last2=Kamionkowski |first2=Marc |last3=Weinberg |first3=Nevin |title=Phantom Energy: Dark Energy with {{math |''w'' &lt; −1}} Causes a Cosmic Doomsday |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=91 |issue=7 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.071301 |bibcode=2003PhRvL..91g1301C |pmid=12935004 |date=August 2003 |pages=071301 |arxiv=astro-ph/0302506 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, for {{math|''w'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|3|2}}}} and {{math|''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;=70&amp;nbsp;km·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·Mpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, the time remaining before the universe ends in this Big Rip is 22&amp;nbsp;billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caldwell |first1=R.

===Alternative theories===
{{see also|Dark energy#Theories of dark energy}}
There are many alternative explanations for the accelerating universe. Some examples are [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]], a proposed form of dark energy with a non-constant state equation, whose density decreases with time. [[Dark fluid]] is an alternative explanation for accelerating expansion which attempts to unite dark matter and dark energy into a single framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Anaelle |last1=Halle |first2=Hongsheng |last2=Zhao |first3=Baojiu |last3=Li |date=2008 |title=Perturbations in a non-uniform dark energy fluid: equations reveal effects of modified gravity and dark matter |arxiv=0711.0958 |doi=10.1086/587744 |journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series |volume=177 |issue=1 |pages=1 |bibcode=2008ApJS..177....1H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, some authors have argued that the accelerated expansion of the universe could be due to a repulsive [[gravitational interaction of antimatter]]&lt;ref name="benoit-levy"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A. |last1=Benoit-Lévy |first2=G. |last2=Chardin |url=http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2012/01/aa16103-10/aa16103-10.html |title=Introducing the Dirac–Milne universe |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=537 |issue=78 |page=A78 |year=2012 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201016103 |arxiv=1110.3054 |bibcode=2012A&amp;A...537A..78B }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hajdukovic"&gt;{{cite journal |first=D.

Another type of model, the backreaction conjecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/0264-9381/28/16/164008 |volume=28 |issue=16 |title=Backreaction: directions of progress |journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity |pages=164008 |arxiv=1102.0408 |bibcode=2011CQGra..28p4008R |last1=Räsänen |first1=Syksy |last2=Ratra |first2=Bharat |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.nucl.012809.104435 |volume=62 |issue=1 |title=Backreaction in Late-Time Cosmology |journal=Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science |pages=57–79 |arxiv=1112.5335 |bibcode=2012ARNPS..62...57B |last1=Buchert |first1=Thomas |last2=Räsänen |first2=Syksy |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was proposed by cosmologist Syksy Räsänen:&lt;ref name="NS2007"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11498-is-dark-energy-an-illusion/ |title=Is dark energy an illusion? |date=2007 |newspaper=[[New Scientist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rate of expansion is not homogenous, but we are in a region where expansion is faster than the background. Inhomogeneities in the early universe cause the formation of walls and bubbles, where the inside of a bubble has less matter than on average. According to general relativity, space is less curved than on the walls, and thus appears to have more volume and a higher expansion rate. In the denser regions, the expansion is slowed by a higher gravitational attraction. Therefore, the inward collapse of the denser regions looks the same as an accelerating expansion of the bubbles, leading us to conclude that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/23025-doctor-who-tardis-regions-universe.html |title=A Cosmic 'Tardis': What the Universe Has In Common with 'Doctor Who' |website=Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefit is that it does not require any new physics such as dark energy. Räsänen does not consider the model likely, but without any falsification, it must remain a possibility. It would require rather large density fluctuations (20%) to work.&lt;ref name="NS2007" /&gt;

A final possibility is that dark energy is an illusion caused by some bias in measurements. For example, if we are located in an emptier-than-average region of space, the observed cosmic expansion rate could be mistaken for a variation in time, or acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wiltshire |first=David L. |year=2007 |title=Exact Solution to the Averaging Problem in Cosmology |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=99 |issue=25 |page=251101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.251101 |pmid=18233512 |bibcode=2007PhRvL..99y1101W |arxiv=0709.0732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ishak, Mustapha |author2=Richardson, James |author3=Garred, David |author4=Whittington, Delilah |author5=Nwankwo, Anthony |author6=Sussman, Roberto |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.78.123531 |journal=Physical Review D |title=Dark Energy or Apparent Acceleration Due to a Relativistic Cosmological Model More Complex than FLRW? |volume=78 |issue=12 |pages=123531 |year=2008 |arxiv=0708.2943 |bibcode=2008PhRvD..78l3531I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mattsson, Teppo |doi=10.1007/s10714-009-0873-z |journal=General Relativity and Gravitation |volume=42 |title=Dark energy as a mirage |issue=3 |pages=567–599 |year=2010 |arxiv=0711.4264 |bibcode=2010GReGr..42..567M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clifton |first=Timothy |author2=Ferreira, Pedro |date=April 2009 |title=Does Dark Energy Really Exist? |journal=Scientific American |volume=300 |issue=4 |pages=48–55 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0409-48 |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=does-dark-energy-exist |accessdate=April 30, 2009 |pmid=19363920 |bibcode=2009SciAm.300d..48C }}&lt;/ref&gt; A different approach uses a cosmological extension of the [[equivalence principle]] to show how space might appear to be expanding more rapidly in the voids surrounding our local cluster.

==Theories for the consequences to the universe==
{{See also|Future of an expanding universe}}
As the universe expands, the density of radiation and ordinary [[dark matter]] declines more quickly than the density of [[dark energy]] (see [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]]) and, eventually, dark energy dominates. Specifically, when the scale of the universe doubles, the density of matter is reduced by a factor of 8, but the density of dark energy is nearly unchanged (it is exactly constant if the dark energy is a [[cosmological constant]]).&lt;ref name=Ryden/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2016}}

In models where dark energy is a cosmological constant, the universe will expand exponentially with time in the far future, coming closer and closer to a [[de Sitter space]]time. This will eventually lead to all evidence for the Big Bang disappearing, as the cosmic microwave background is redshifted to lower intensities and longer wavelengths. Eventually its frequency will be low enough that it will be absorbed by the [[interstellar medium]], and so be screened from any observer within the galaxy. This will occur when the universe is less than 50 times its current age, leading to the end of cosmology as we know it as the distant universe turns dark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krauss |first1=Lawrence M. |last2=Scherrer |first2=Robert J. |title=The return of a static universe and the end of cosmology |journal=General Relativity and Gravitation |year=2007 |volume=39 |issue=10 |pages=1545–1550 |doi=10.1007/s10714-007-0472-9 |arxiv=0704.0221 |bibcode=2007GReGr..39.1545K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A constantly expanding universe with non-zero cosmological constant has mass density decreasing over time, to an undetermined point when zero matter density is reached. All matter (electrons, protons and neutrons) would ionize and disintegrate, with objects dissipating away.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Baez]], "The End of the Universe", 7 February 2016. http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/end.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives for the [[ultimate fate of the universe]] include the [[Big Rip]] mentioned above, a [[Big Bounce]], [[Big Freeze]] or [[Big Crunch]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7050">'''Aesthetics of nature''' is a sub-field of [[ethics|philosophical ethics]], and refers to the study of natural objects from their [[aesthetics|aesthetical]] perspective.

==History==
Aesthetics of nature developed as a sub-field of philosophical ethics. In the 18th and 19th century, the aesthetics of nature advanced the concepts of disinterestedness, the pictures, and the introduction of the idea of positive aesthetics.&lt;ref name=Carlson2012&gt;
{{cite book
  |last=Carlson|first=Allen
  |chapter=Environmental Aesthetics
  |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
  |edition=Summer 2012
  |editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta
  |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2012/entries/environmental-aesthetics/
  |accessdate=2 October 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first major developments of nature occurred in the 18th century. The concept of disinterestedness had been explained by many thinkers. [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley-Cooper]] introduced the concept as a way of characterizing the notion of the aesthetic, later magnified by [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], who expanded it to exclude personal and utilitarianism interests and associations of a more general nature from aesthetic experience.&lt;ref name=Stolnitz1961&gt;
{{cite journal
  |last=Stolnitz|first=J.
  |year=1961
  |title=Of the Origins of ‘Aesthetic Disinterestedness’
  |journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism
  |volume=20|pages=131–143
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This concept was further developed by [[Archibald Alison (author)|Archibald Alison]] who referred it to a particular state of mind.&lt;ref name=Stolnitz1961/&gt;

==Theories==
The theory of disinterestedness opened doors for a better understanding of the aesthetics dimensions of nature in terms of three conceptualizations: 
# The idea of beautiful: this applied to tamed and cultivated European gardens and landscapes&lt;ref name=Carlson2012/&gt;
# The idea of the sublime: this explained the threatening and terrifying side of nature such as mountains and wilderness; however, when it is viewed through the disinterestedness perspective, it can be aesthetically appreciated rather than feared or neglected&lt;ref name=Carlson2012/&gt;
# The notion of the picturesque: the term "picturesque" means "picture-like", where the natural world is experienced as if it is divided into art-like scenes&lt;ref name=Carlson2012/&gt;

Objects experienced as beautiful tend to be small, smooth, and fair in color.&lt;ref name=Conron2000&gt;
{{cite book
  |last=Conron|first=J.
  |year=2000
  |title=American Picturesque
  |location=University Park, Pennsylvania
  |publisher=[[Pennsylvania State University Press]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17–18}} In contrast, objects viewed as sublime tend to be powerful, intense and terrifying. Picturesque items are a mixture of both, which can be seen as varied and irregular, rich and forceful, and even vibrant.&lt;ref name=Conron2000/&gt;{{rp|17–18}}

==21st century developments==

Cognitive and non-cognitive approaches of nature have directed their focus from natural environments to the consideration of human and human influenced environments and developed aesthetic investigations of everyday life.(Carlson and Lintott, 2007; Parsons 2008a; Carlson 2010){{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Human Perspectives and Relationship with Nature==
People may be mistaken by the [[objet d'art|art object]] analogy. For instance, a [[sandhill crane]] is not an art object; an art object is not a sandhill crane. In fact, an art object should be called an ''artifact''.&lt;ref name=Rolston2002&gt;

  |isbn=9780754605430
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crane is wildlife on its own and is not an art object. This can be related to Satio's definition of the cognitive view. In elaboration, the crane lives through various ecosystems such as Yellowstone. Nature is a living system which includes animals, plants, and Eco-systems. In contrast, an art object has no regeneration, evolutionary history, or metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; An individual may be in the forest and perceive it as beautiful because of the plethora of colors such as red, green, and yellow. This is a result of the chemicals interacting with chlorophyll.&lt;ref name=Leopold&gt;
{{cite book
  |first=Aldo|last=Leopold
  |year=1968
  |title=A Sand County Almanac
  |location=New York
  |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]
  |pages=224–225
}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's aesthetic experience may increase; however, none of the things mentioned have anything to do with what is really going on in the forest. The chlorophyll is capturing solar energy and the residual chemicals protect the trees from insect grazing.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt;

Any color perceived by human visitors for a few hours is entirely different from what is really happening.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt;  According to Leopold, the three features of [[ecosystem]]s that generate land ethic are integrity, stability and beauty.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt; None of the mentioned features are real in nature.  Ecosystems are not stable: they are dramatically changing and they have little integration; ergo, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt;

==Objectives==
In a Post-Modern approach, when an individual engages in aesthetically appreciating a natural thing, we give meaning to the thing we appreciate and in that meaning, we express and develop our own attitudes, values and beliefs.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008&gt;
{{cite book
  |last=Parsons|first=G.
  |title=Aesthetics and Nature
  |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]
  |year=2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our interest in natural things are not only a passive reflection of our inclinations, as Croce describes as the appreciation of nature as looking in a mirror, or what we might call our inward life; but may instead be the things we come across in nature that engage and stimulate our imagination.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008/&gt; As a result, we are challenged to think differently and apply thoughts and associations to in new situations and ways.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008/&gt;
 
As a characterization of the appreciation of art, nature aestheticists argue that post modernism is a mistaken view because we do not have a case of anything goes.The aesthetics appreciation of art is governed by some normative standards.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008/&gt; In the world of art, criticism may take place when people come together and discuss books and films or critics write appraisals for publications. On the contrary, there are not obvious instances of debate and appraisals where different judgments about the aesthetics of character of nature are evaluated.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008/&gt;

The '''balance of nature''' is a theory that proposes that ecological systems are usually in a stable equilibrium or [[homeostasis]], which is to say that a small change in some particular parameter (the size of a particular population, for example) will be corrected by some [[negative feedback]] that will bring the parameter back to its original "point of balance" with the rest of the system.  It may apply where populations depend on each other, for example in predator/prey systems, or relationships between herbivores and their food source.  It is also sometimes applied to the relationship between the Earth's ecosystem, the composition of the atmosphere, and the world's weather.

The [[Gaia hypothesis]] is a balance of nature-based theory that suggests that the Earth and its ecology may act as co-ordinated systems in order to maintain the balance of nature.

The theory that nature is permanently in balance has been largely discredited by scientists working in [[ecology]], as it has been found that chaotic changes in population levels are common, but nevertheless the idea continues to be popular in the general public.&lt;ref name="Zim"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://pus.sagepub.com/content/16/4/393.abstract| title=Ambiguous, circular and polysemous: students' definitions of the "balance of nature" metaphor| journal=Public Understanding of Science| date=October 2007| first=Corinne| last= Zimmerman| volume= 16| number= 4| pages=393–406| doi= 10.1177/0963662505063022| accessdate=19 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kricher2009&gt;{{cite book| author=Kricher, John | year=2009 | title=The Balance of Nature: Ecology's Enduring Myth | publisher=Princeton University Press | isbn=978-0691138985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the later half of the twentieth century the theory was superseded by [[catastrophe theory]] and [[chaos theory]].

==History of the theory==
The concept that nature maintains its condition is of ancient provenance; [[Herodotus]] commented on the wonderful relationship between predator and prey species, which remained in a steady proportion to one another, with predators never excessively consuming their prey populations.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "balance of nature" concept once ruled ecological research, as well as once governing the management of natural resources. This led to a [[doctrine]] popular among some [[conservation movement|conservationist]]s that nature was best left to its own devices, and that [[human]] intervention into it was by definition unacceptable.&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/31/science/new-eye-on-nature-the-real-constant-is-eternal-turmoil.html| title=New Eye on Nature: The Real Constant Is Eternal Turmoil| newspaper=The New York Times| first=William K. |last=Stevens| date=31 July 1990| accessdate=19 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The validity of a "balance of nature" was already questioned in the early 1900s, but the general abandonment of the theory by scientists working in [[ecology]] only happened in the last quarter of that century when studies showed that it did not match what could be observed among plant and animal populations.&lt;ref name=Kricher2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Heneghan, Liam | url=https://aeon.co/essays/nature-is-out-of-balance-but-it-s-still-worth-saving |title=Out of kilter | publisher=aeon | date=9 October 2012  | accessdate=16 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predator prey interactions==
Predator-prey populations tend to show [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] behavior within limits, where the sizes of populations change in a way that may appear random, but is in fact obeying [[Determinism|deterministic]] laws based only on the relationship between a population and its food source illustrated by the [[Lotka–Volterra equation]].  An experimental example of this was shown in an eight-year study on small [[Baltic Sea]] creatures such as [[plankton]], which were isolated from the rest of the ocean. Each member of the [[food web]] was shown to take turns multiplying and declining, even though the scientists kept the outside conditions constant. An article in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' stated; "Advanced mathematical techniques proved the indisputable presence of chaos in this food web ... short-term prediction is possible, but long-term prediction is not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Human intervention==
Although some conservationist organizations argue that human activity is incompatible with a balanced ecosystem, there are numerous examples in history showing that several modern day habitats originate from human activity: some of Latin America's rain forests owe their existence to humans planting and transplanting them, while the abundance of grazing animals in the [[Serengeti]] plain of Africa is thought by some ecologists to be partly due to human-set fires that created [[savanna]] habitats.&lt;ref name="NY" /&gt;

Possibly one of the best examples of an ecosystem fundamentally modified by human activity can be observed as a consequence of the Australian [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] practice of "[[Fire-stick farming]]". The legacy of this practice over long periods has resulted in forests being converted to grasslands capable of sustaining larger populations of faunal prey, particularly in the northern and western regions of the continent. So thorough has been the effect of these deliberate regular burnings that many plant and tree species from affected regions have now completely adapted to the annual fire regime in that they require the passage of a fire before their seeds will even germinate. One school in Los Angeles states, " “We have let our kids go to the forest area of the playground. However, five years later, we found that none of the flowers were growing, the natural damp soil had been hardened, and all of the beautiful grass had been plucked,”.

==Continued popularity of the theory==
Despite being discredited among ecologists, the theory is widely held to be true by the general public, with one authority calling it an "enduring myth".&lt;ref name=Kricher2009/&gt; At least in [[Midwestern America]], the "balance of nature" idea was shown to be widely held by both science majors and the general student population.&lt;ref name="Zim" /&gt; In a study at the [[University of Patras]], educational sciences students were asked to reason about the future of ecosystems which suffered human-driven disturbances. Subjects agreed that it was very likely for the ecosystems to fully recover their initial state, referring to either a 'recovery process' which restores the initial 'balance', or specific 'recovery mechanisms' as an ecosystem's inherent characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ergazaki|first=Marida|last2=Ampatzidis|first2=Georgios|date=2012-06-01|title=Students’ Reasoning about the Future of Disturbed or Protected Ecosystems &amp;amp; the Idea of the ‘Balance of Nature’|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11165-011-9208-7|journal=Research in Science Education|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=511–530|doi=10.1007/s11165-011-9208-7|issn=0157-244X|bibcode=2012RScEd..42..511E}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 study, Ampatzidis and Ergazaki discuss the learning objectives and design criteria that a learning environment for non-biology major students should meet to support them challenge the "balance of nature" idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ampatzidis|first=Georgios|last2=Ergazaki|first2=Marida|date=2017-10-01|title=Toward an “Anti-Balance of Nature” Learning Environment for Non-Biology Major Students: Learning Objectives and Design Criteria|url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/nse/abstracts/46/1/170016|journal=Natural Sciences Education|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|doi=10.4195/nse2017.07.0016|issn=1059-9053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though most of the mass in the universe seems to be in the form of dark matter, Big Bang theory and various observations seem to indicate that it is not made out of conventional [[baryonic matter]] (protons, neutrons, and electrons) but it is unclear exactly what it ''is'' made out of.

Since [[Georges Lemaître]] first noted in 1927 that an expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point, scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion.

American astronomer Edwin Hubble observed that the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their [[redshift]]s. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction.&lt;ref name="hubble"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the [[Copernican principle]] (that the Earth is not the center of the universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.

Large [[particle accelerator]]s can replicate the conditions that prevailed after the early moments of the universe, resulting in confirmation and refinement of the details of the Big Bang model. However, these accelerators can only probe so far into [[high-energy physics|high energy regimes]]. Consequently, the state of the universe in the earliest instants of the Big Bang expansion is still poorly understood and an area of open investigation and speculation.

The first [[subatomic particle]]s to be formed included [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s, and [[electron]]s. Though simple [[big bang nucleosynthesis|atomic nuclei formed]] within the first three minutes after the Big Bang, thousands of years passed before the first [[Recombination (cosmology)|electrically neutral atoms formed]]. The majority of atoms produced by the Big Bang were [[hydrogen]], along with [[helium]] and traces of [[lithium]]. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through [[gravity]] to form [[star]]s and galaxies, and the heavier elements were synthesized either [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|within stars]] or [[supernova nucleosynthesis|during supernovae]].

The Big Bang theory offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the [[cosmic microwave background|CMB]], [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|large scale structure]], and [[Hubble's Law]].&lt;ref name=Wright2009&gt;

The governing equations were formulated by [[Alexander Friedmann]], and similar solutions were worked on by [[Willem de Sitter]]. Since then, astrophysicists have incorporated observational and theoretical additions into the Big Bang model, and its [[parametrization]] as the [[Lambda-CDM model]] serves as the framework for current investigations of theoretical cosmology.

This may be explained by considering that commonly-used calculations and limits for [[gravitational collapse]] are usually based upon objects of relatively constant size, such as [[star]]s, and do not apply to [[metric expansion of space|rapidly expanding space]] such as the Big Bang.

=== Inflation and baryogenesis ===
{{Main| Cosmic inflation|baryogenesis}}
The earliest phases of the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models the universe was filled [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneously]] and [[isotropic]]ally with a very high [[energy density]] and huge temperatures and [[pressure]]s and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−37&lt;/sup&gt; seconds into the expansion, a [[phase transition]] caused a [[cosmic inflation]], during which the universe grew [[exponential growth|exponentially]] during which time [[Quantum fluctuation|density fluctuations]] that occurred because of the [[uncertainty principle]] were amplified into the seeds that would later form the [[Structure formation|large-scale structure]] of the universe.&lt;ref name="guth"&gt;{{cite book

This resulted in the predominance of [[matter]] over [[antimatter]] in the present universe.&lt;ref name="kolb_c6"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The universe continued to decrease in density and fall in temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. [[Explicit symmetry breaking|Symmetry breaking]] phase transitions put the [[fundamental force]]s of physics and the parameters of [[elementary particles]] into their present form.&lt;ref name="kolb_c7"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt; After about 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in [[particle accelerator]]s. At about 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form [[baryon]]s such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was now no longer high enough to create new proton–antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons–antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons. After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the universe was dominated by [[photon]]s (with a minor contribution from [[neutrino]]s).

A few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion (one thousand million) [[kelvin]] and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's [[deuterium]] and helium [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] in a process called [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="kolb_c4"/&gt; Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei.&lt;ref name="peacock_c9"/&gt;

As the universe cooled, the [[rest mass]] energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate that of the photon [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]]. After about 379,000 years, the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation is known as the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]].&lt;ref name="peacock_c9"&gt;Peacock (1999), chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Biochemistry|chemistry of life]] may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, [[Age of the universe|13.8 billion years ago]], during a habitable epoch when the universe was only 10–17 million years old.&lt;ref name="Loeb_2014"&gt;{{cite web |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |format=PDF |publisher=Cambridge University Press / Astronomy Department, Harvard University |date=24 September 2014 |url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~loeb/habitable.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |date=October 2014 |journal=[[International Journal of Astrobiology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |doi=10.1017/S1473550414000196 |arxiv=1312.0613 |bibcode=2014IJAsB..13..337L|citeseerx=10.1.1.748.4820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141202"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dreifus |first=Claudia |authorlink=Claudia Dreifus |title=Much-Discussed Views That Go Way Back - Avi Loeb Ponders the Early Universe, Nature and Life |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/science/avi-loeb-ponders-the-early-universe-nature-and-life.html |date=2 December 2014 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosmic acceleration ===
{{Main|Accelerating expansion of the universe}}
Independent lines of evidence from Type Ia supernovae and the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] imply that the universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as [[dark energy]], which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. When the universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused the [[Hubble's law|expansion of the universe]] to slowly begin to accelerate.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt;

Dark energy in its simplest formulation takes the form of the [[cosmological constant]] term in [[Einstein's field equation]]s of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown and, more generally, the details of its [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] and relationship with the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics continue to be investigated both through observation and theoretically.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt;

All of this cosmic evolution after the [[inflationary epoch]] can be rigorously described and modeled by the ΛCDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks of quantum mechanics and Einstein's General Relativity. There is no well-supported model describing the action prior to 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; seconds or so. Apparently a new unified theory of [[quantum gravity|quantum gravitation]] is needed to break this barrier. Understanding this earliest of eras in the history of the universe is currently one of the greatest [[unsolved problems in physics]].

== Features of the model ==
The Big Bang theory depends on two major assumptions: the universality of [[physical law]]s and the [[cosmological principle]]. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the universe is [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]] and [[isotropy|isotropic]].

These ideas were initially taken as postulates, but today there are efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the [[fine structure constant]] over much of the [[age of the universe]] is of order 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

If the large-scale universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth, the cosmological principle can be derived from the simpler [[Copernican principle]], which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; via observations of the CMB. The universe has been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level.&lt;ref&gt;

===Expansion of space===
{{Main|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Metric expansion of space}}
General relativity describes spacetime by a [[metric tensor|metric]], which determines the distances that separate nearby points. The points, which can be galaxies, stars, or other objects, are themselves specified using a [[coordinate chart]] or "grid" that is laid down over all [[spacetime]]. The cosmological principle implies that the metric should be [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]] and [[isotropic]] on large scales, which uniquely singles out the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] (FLRW metric). 
This metric contains a [[scale factor]], which describes how the size of the universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a [[coordinate system]] to be made, called [[comoving coordinates]]. In this coordinate system, the grid expands along with the universe, and objects that are moving only because of the expansion of the universe, remain at fixed points on the grid. While their ''coordinate'' distance ([[comoving distance]]) remains constant, the ''physical'' distance between two such co-moving points expands proportionally with the [[scale factor]] of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Big Bang is not an explosion of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe. Instead, [[metric expansion of space|space itself expands]] with time everywhere and increases the physical distance between two comoving points. In other words, the Big Bang is not an explosion ''in space'', but rather an expansion ''of space''.&lt;ref name="HTUW"/&gt; Because the FLRW metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our universe only on large scales—local concentrations of matter such as our galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space.&lt;ref&gt;Tamara M. Davis and Charles H. Lineweaver, ''Expanding Confusion: common misconceptions of cosmological horizons and the superluminal expansion of the Universe''. [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0310808 astro-ph/0310808]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horizons===
{{Main|List of cosmological horizons}}
An important feature of the Big Bang spacetime is the presence of [[particle horizon]]s. Since the universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not had time to reach us. This places a limit or a ''past horizon'' on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never "catch up" to very distant objects. This defines a ''future horizon'', which limits the events in the future that we will be able to influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|FLRW]] model that describes our universe.&lt;ref name="kolb_c3"/&gt;

Our understanding of the universe back to very early times [[Big Bang#Horizon problem|suggests]] that there is a past horizon, though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity of the universe at early times. So our view cannot extend further backward in time, though the horizon recedes in space. If the expansion of the universe continues to [[accelerating universe|accelerate]], there is a future horizon as well.&lt;ref name="kolb_c3"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Etymology===
English astronomer [[Fred Hoyle]] is credited with coining the term "Big Bang" during a 1949 BBC radio broadcast, saying: "These theories were based on the hypothesis that all the matter in the universe was created in one big bang at a particular time in the remote past."&lt;ref&gt;

It is popularly reported that Hoyle, who favored an alternative "[[steady state universe|steady state]]" cosmological model, intended this to be pejorative,&lt;ref&gt;

The Big Bang theory developed from observations of the structure of the universe and from theoretical considerations. In 1912 [[Vesto Slipher]] measured the first [[Doppler shift]] of a "[[spiral nebula]]" (spiral nebula is the obsolete term for spiral galaxies), and soon discovered that almost all such nebulae were receding from Earth. He did not grasp the cosmological implications of this fact, and indeed at the time it was [[Shapley–Curtis debate|highly controversial]] whether or not these nebulae were "island universes" outside our [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;

Independently deriving Friedmann's equations in 1927, [[Georges Lemaître]], a Belgian physicist, proposed that the inferred recession of the nebulae was due to the expansion of the universe.&lt;ref name=gl1927&gt;

}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 Lemaître went further and suggested that the evident expansion of the universe, if projected back in time, meant that the further in the past the smaller the universe was, until at some finite time in the past all the mass of the universe was concentrated into a single point, a "primeval atom" where and when the fabric of time and space came into existence.&lt;ref&gt;

Starting in 1924, Hubble painstakingly developed a series of distance indicators, the forerunner of the [[cosmic distance ladder]], using the {{convert|100|in|m|adj=on}} [[Hooker telescope]] at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]]. This allowed him to estimate distances to galaxies whose redshifts had already been measured, mostly by Slipher. In 1929 Hubble discovered a correlation between distance and recession velocity—now known as [[Hubble's law]].&lt;ref name="hubble"/&gt;&lt;ref name="christianson"&gt;

In the 1920s and 1930s almost every major cosmologist preferred an eternal [[Steady state theory|steady state]] universe, and several complained that the beginning of time implied by the Big Bang imported religious concepts into physics; this objection was later repeated by supporters of the steady state theory.&lt;ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, observations of certain [[globular cluster]]s appeared to indicate that they were about 15&amp;nbsp;billion years old, which [[cosmic age problem|conflicted]] with most then-current estimates of the age of the universe (and indeed with the age measured today).

===Hubble's law and the expansion of space===
{{Main|Hubble's law|Metric expansion of space}}
{{See also|Distance measures (cosmology)|Scale factor (universe)}}
Observations of distant galaxies and [[quasar]]s show that these objects are redshifted—the [[light]] emitted from them has been shifted to longer wavelengths. This can be seen by taking a [[frequency spectrum]] of an object and matching the [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] pattern of [[emission line]]s or [[absorption line]]s corresponding to [[atom]]s of the [[chemical element]]s interacting with the light. These redshifts are [[Homogeneity (physics)|uniformly]] isotropic, distributed evenly among the observed objects in all directions. If the redshift is interpreted as a Doppler shift, the recessional [[velocity]] of the object can be calculated. For some galaxies, it is possible to estimate distances via the [[cosmic distance ladder]]. When the recessional velocities are plotted against these distances, a linear relationship known as Hubble's law is observed:&lt;ref name="hubble" /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;v = H_0D&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the recessional [[velocity]] of the [[galaxy]] or other distant object,
* &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[comoving distance]] to the object, and
* &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is [[Hubble's constant]], measured to be {{val|70.4|+1.3|-1.4}} [[kilometres|km]]/[[second|s]]/[[Megaparsec|Mpc]] by the [[WMAP]] probe.&lt;ref name="wmap7year" /&gt;

[[Hubble's law]] has two possible explanations. Either we are at the center of an explosion of galaxies—which is untenable given the [[Copernican principle]]—or the universe is [[Metric expansion of space|uniformly expanding]] everywhere. This universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by Alexander Friedmann in 1922&lt;ref name=af1922 /&gt; and Georges Lemaître in 1927,&lt;ref name=gl1927 /&gt; well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann, Lemaître, Robertson, and Walker]].

The theory requires the relation &lt;math&gt;v = HD&lt;/math&gt; to hold at all times, where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[comoving distance]], ''v'' is the [[recessional velocity]], and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; vary as the universe expands (hence we write &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; to denote the present-day Hubble "constant"). For distances much smaller than the size of the [[observable universe]], the Hubble redshift can be thought of as the Doppler shift corresponding to the recession velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. However, the redshift is not a true Doppler shift, but rather the result of the expansion of the universe between the time the light was emitted and the time that it was detected.&lt;ref name="peacock_c3"&gt;Peacock (1999), chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

That [[Metric expansion of space|space is undergoing metric expansion]] is shown by direct observational evidence of the [[Cosmological principle]] and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical redshifts are extremely [[isotropic]] and [[Homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneous]],&lt;ref name="hubble" /&gt; supporting the Cosmological principle that the universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts were the result of an explosion from a center distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions.

Measurements of the effects of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle, that, on a cosmological scale, the Earth is not in a central position.&lt;ref&gt;

Uniform cooling of the CMB over billions of years is explainable only if the universe is experiencing a metric expansion, and excludes the possibility that we are near the unique center of an explosion.

In 1964 [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] serendipitously discovered the cosmic background radiation, an omnidirectional signal in the [[microwave]] band.&lt;ref name="penzias" /&gt; Their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the big-bang predictions by Alpher, Herman and Gamow around 1950. Through the 1970s the radiation was found to be approximately consistent with a black body spectrum in all directions; this spectrum has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe, and today corresponds to approximately 2.725&amp;nbsp;K. This tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, and Penzias and Wilson were awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] in 1978.

The ''surface of last scattering'' corresponding to emission of the CMB occurs shortly after ''[[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]]'', the epoch when neutral hydrogen becomes stable. Prior to this, the universe comprised a hot dense photon-baryon plasma sea where photons were quickly [[Thomson scattering|scattered]] from free charged particles.

In 1989, [[NASA]] launched the [[Cosmic Background Explorer satellite]] (COBE), which made two major advances: in 1990, high-precision spectrum measurements showed that the &lt;abbr title="cosmic microwave background raditation"&gt;CMB&lt;/abbr&gt; frequency spectrum is an almost perfect [[blackbody]] with no deviations at a level of 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and measured a residual temperature of 2.726&amp;nbsp;K (more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly to 2.7255&amp;nbsp;K); then in 1992, further COBE measurements discovered tiny fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB temperature across the sky, at a level of about one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="cobe" /&gt; [[John C. Mather]] and [[George Smoot]] were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for their leadership in these results.

During the following decade, CMB anisotropies were further investigated by a large number of ground-based and balloon experiments. In 2000–2001 several experiments, most notably [[BOOMERanG experiment|BOOMERanG]], found the [[shape of the universe]] to be spatially almost flat by measuring the typical angular size (the size on the sky) of the anisotropies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Melchiorri |first=A., et. al. |title=A measurement of Omega from the North American test flight of BOOMERANG |volume=536 |issue=2 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |year=1999 |arxiv=astro-ph/9911445|doi=10.1086/312744 |pmid=10859119 |bibcode=2000ApJ...536L..63M |pages=L63–L66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Bernardis |first=P. |display-authors=etal |title=A Flat Universe from High-Resolution Maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation |pages=955–959 |journal=Nature |volume=404 |issue=6781 |year=2000 |arxiv=

In early 2003, the first results of the [[WMAP|Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) were released, yielding what were at the time the most accurate values for some of the cosmological parameters. The results disproved several specific [[cosmic inflation]] models, but are consistent with the [[inflation theory]] in general.&lt;ref name="wmap1year" /&gt; The [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] space probe was launched in May 2009. Other ground and balloon based [[List of cosmic microwave background experiments|cosmic microwave background experiments]] are ongoing.

===Abundance of primordial elements===
{{Main|Big Bang nucleosynthesis}}
Using the Big Bang model it is possible to calculate the concentration of [[helium-4]], [[helium-3]], deuterium, and [[lithium-7]] in the universe as ratios to the amount of ordinary hydrogen.&lt;ref name = "kolb_c4"/&gt; The relative abundances depend on a single parameter, the ratio of [[photon]]s to baryons. This value can be calculated independently from the detailed structure of [[cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] fluctuations. The ratios predicted (by mass, not by number) are about 0.25 for &lt;chem&gt;^4He/H&lt;/chem&gt;, about 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;chem&gt;^2H/H&lt;/chem&gt;, about 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;chem&gt;^3He/H&lt;/chem&gt; and about 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;chem&gt;^7Li/H&lt;/chem&gt;.&lt;ref name="kolb_c4"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The measured abundances all agree at least roughly with those predicted from a single value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. The agreement is excellent for deuterium, close but formally discrepant for &lt;chem&gt;^4He&lt;/chem&gt;, and off by a factor of two for &lt;chem&gt;^7Li&lt;/chem&gt;; in the latter two cases there are substantial [[systematic error|systematic uncertainties]]. Nonetheless, the general consistency with abundances predicted by Big Bang nucleosynthesis is strong evidence for the Big Bang, as the theory is the only known explanation for the relative abundances of light elements, and it is virtually impossible to "tune" the Big Bang to produce much more or less than 20–30% helium.&lt;ref&gt;

===Galactic evolution and distribution===
{{Main|Galaxy formation and evolution|Structure formation}}
Detailed observations of the [[Galaxy morphological classification|morphology]] and [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|distribution]] of galaxies and [[quasars]] are in agreement with the current state of the Big Bang theory. A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the Big Bang, and since then, larger structures have been forming, such as [[galaxy clusters]] and [[supercluster]]s.&lt;ref name="Bertschinger"/&gt;

Populations of stars have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are observed as they were in the early universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently, appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of [[star formation]], galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.&lt;ref name="Bertschinger"&gt;

In 2011, astronomers found what they believe to be pristine clouds of primordial gas by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium.&lt;ref&gt;

The age of the universe as estimated from the Hubble expansion and the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] is now in good agreement with other estimates using the ages of the oldest stars, both as measured by applying the theory of [[stellar evolution]] to [[globular clusters]] and through [[radiometric dating]] of individual [[Population II]] stars.&lt;ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Problems}}Problems and related issues in physics==
{{See also|List of unsolved problems in physics}}
As with any theory, a number of mysteries and problems have arisen as a result of the development of the Big Bang theory. Some of these mysteries and problems have been resolved while others are still outstanding. Proposed solutions to some of the problems in the Big Bang model have revealed new mysteries of their own. For example, the [[horizon problem]], the [[magnetic monopole problem]], and the [[flatness problem]] are most commonly resolved with [[Cosmic inflation|inflationary theory]], but the details of the inflationary universe are still left unresolved and many, including some founders of the theory, say it has been disproven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Earman |first1=John |last2=Mosterín |first2=Jesús |date=March 1999 |title=A Critical Look at Inflationary Cosmology |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=1–49 |doi=10.1086/392675 |jstor=188736}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Baryon asymmetry===
{{Main|Baryon asymmetry}}
It is not yet understood why the universe has more matter than antimatter.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Kolb and Turner, chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally assumed that when the universe was young and very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the [[Sakharov conditions]] must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that [[C-symmetry]] and [[CP-symmetry]] are violated and that the universe depart from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].&lt;ref name="sakharov"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;(Translated in ''[[Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics Letters]]'' '''5''', 24 (1967).)
&lt;/ref&gt; All these conditions occur in the [[Standard Model]], but the effects are not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry.

===Dark energy===
{{Main|Dark energy}}
Measurements of the [[redshift]]–[[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] relation for [[type Ia supernova]]e indicate that the expansion of the universe has been [[accelerating universe|accelerating]] since the universe was about half its present age. To explain this acceleration, general relativity requires that much of the energy in the universe consists of a component with large [[equation of state (cosmology)|negative pressure]], dubbed "dark energy".&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt;

Dark energy, though speculative, solves numerous problems. Measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background]] indicate that the universe is very nearly spatially flat, and therefore according to general relativity the universe must have almost exactly the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]] of mass/energy. But the mass density of the universe can be measured from its gravitational clustering, and is found to have only about 30% of the critical density.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt; Since theory suggests that dark energy does not cluster in the usual way it is the best explanation for the "missing" energy density. Dark energy also helps to explain two geometrical measures of the overall curvature of the universe, one using the frequency of [[gravitational lens]]es, and the other using the characteristic pattern of the [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]] as a cosmic ruler.

Negative pressure is believed to be a property of [[vacuum energy]], but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos.&lt;ref name="wmap7year" /&gt; According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the [[far future]] as dark energy becomes even more dominant.

The dark energy component of the universe has been explained by theorists using a variety of competing theories including Einstein's [[cosmological constant]] but also extending to more exotic forms of [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] or other modified gravity schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mortonson |first1=Michael J. |last2=Weinberg |first2=David H.|last3=White |first3=Martin |title=Dark Energy: A Short Review |journal=Particle Data Group 2014 Review of Particle Physics |date=December 2013 |arxiv=1401.0046|bibcode = 2014arXiv1401.0046M }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mortonson |first1=Michael J. |last2=Weinberg |first2=David H.|last3=White |first3=Martin |title=Dark Energy: A Short Review |work=LEVEL 5 — A Knowledgebase for Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology, NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology |date=2014-06-27 |url=https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March14/Mortonson/Mortonson_contents.html |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cosmological constant problem]], sometimes called the "most embarrassing problem in physics", results from the apparent discrepancy between the measured energy density of dark energy, and the one naively predicted from [[Planck units]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rugh |first1=S.&amp;thinsp;E. |last2=Zinkernagel |first2=H. |title=The quantum vacuum and the cosmological constant problem |pages=663–705 |volume=33 |issue=4 |date=December 2002 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1355219802000333 |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B |doi=10.1016/S1355-2198(02)00033-3 |arxiv=hep-th/0012253|bibcode = 2002SHPMP..33..663R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark matter===
{{Main|Dark matter}}
[[File:Cosmological Composition – Pie Chart.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|[[pie chart|Chart]] shows the proportion of different components of the universe {{spaced ndash}} about 95% is [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]].]]
During the 1970s and the 1980s, various observations showed that there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal [[baryon]]ic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, [[galaxy cluster]] velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, [[gravitational lensing]] studies, and [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray measurements]] of galaxy clusters.&lt;ref&gt;

Indirect evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational influence on other matter, as no dark matter particles have been observed in laboratories. Many [[particle physics]] candidates for dark matter have been proposed, and several projects to detect them directly are underway.&lt;ref name="pdg"&gt;

===Horizon problem===
The [[horizon problem]] results from the premise that information cannot travel [[faster than light]]. In a universe of finite age this sets a limit—the [[particle horizon]]—on the separation of any two regions of space that are in [[causality (physics)|causal]] contact.&lt;ref name="kolb_c8"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt; The observed isotropy of the [[Cosmic microwave background|CMB]] is problematic in this regard: if the universe had been dominated by radiation or matter at all times up to the epoch of last scattering, the particle horizon at that time would correspond to about 2 degrees on the sky. There would then be no mechanism to cause wider regions to have the same temperature.&lt;ref name="Ryden2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Sue Ryden|title=Introduction to cosmology|year=2003|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0-8053-8912-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|191–202}}

A resolution to this apparent inconsistency is offered by [[inflationary theory]] in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently on opposite sides of the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.&lt;ref name="guth"/&gt;{{rp|180–186}}

[[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]] predicts that during the inflationary phase there would be [[primordial fluctuations|quantum thermal fluctuations]], which would be magnified to cosmic scale. These fluctuations serve as the seeds of all current structure in the universe.&lt;ref name="Ryden2003"/&gt;{{rp|207}} Inflation predicts that the [[primordial fluctuations]] are nearly [[Scale invariance|scale invariant]] and [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]], which has been accurately confirmed by measurements of the CMB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spergel |first=D.

If inflation occurred, exponential expansion would push large regions of space well beyond our observable horizon.&lt;ref name="guth"/&gt;{{rp|180–186}}

A related issue to the classic horizon problem arises because in most standard cosmological inflation models, inflation ceases well before [[electroweak symmetry breaking]] occurs, so inflation should not be able to prevent large-scale discontinuities in the [[electroweak vacuum]] since distant parts of the observable universe were causally separate when the [[electroweak epoch]] ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R.

===Magnetic monopoles===
The [[magnetic monopole]] objection was raised in the late 1970s. [[Grand unified theory|Grand unified theories]] predicted [[topological defect]]s in space that would manifest as [[magnetic monopole]]s. These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that no monopoles have been found. This problem is also resolved by [[cosmic inflation]], which removes all point defects from the observable universe, in the same way that it drives the geometry to flatness.&lt;ref name="kolb_c8"/&gt;

===Flatness problem===
[[File:End of universe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The overall [[Shape of the universe|geometry of the universe]] is determined by whether the [[Density parameter|Omega cosmological parameter]] is less than, equal to or greater than 1. Shown from top to bottom are a [[Shape of the universe#Spherical universe|closed universe]] with positive curvature, a [[Shape of the universe#Hyperbolic universe|hyperbolic universe]] with negative curvature and a [[flat universe]] with zero curvature.]]

The [[flatness problem]] (also known as the oldness problem) is an observational problem associated with a [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] (FLRW).&lt;ref name="kolb_c8"/&gt; The universe may have positive, negative, or zero spatial [[curvature]] depending on its total energy density. Curvature is negative if its density is less than the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]]; positive if greater; and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to be ''flat''.

The problem is that any small departure from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat.&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;Strictly, dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant drives the universe towards a flat state; however, our universe remained close to flat for several billion years before the dark energy density became significant.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the [[Planck time]], 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds,&lt;ref name=HTUW/&gt; the fact that the universe has reached neither a [[heat death of the universe|heat death]] nor a [[Big Crunch]] after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.&lt;ref&gt;

== Cause ==
{{Main|Problem of why there is anything at all}}
Physics may conclude that [[time]] did not exist before 'Big Bang', but 'started' with the &lt;!--beginning point--&gt;Big Bang and hence there might be no 'beginning', 'before' or potentially 'cause' and instead always existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Big Bang?

== Ultimate fate of the universe ==
{{Main|Ultimate fate of the universe}}

Before observations of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios for the future of the universe. If the mass [[density]] of the universe were greater than the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]], then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started—a Big Crunch.&lt;ref name="kolb_c3"/&gt;

Alternatively, if the density in the universe were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out, leaving [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s, and [[black hole]]s. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the universe would asymptotically approach [[absolute zero]]—a [[Big Freeze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Griswold |first=Britt |title=What is the Ultimate Fate of the Universe? |work=Universe 101 Big Bang Theory |publisher=NASA |date=2012 |url=
http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_fate.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, if the proton were [[proton decay|unstable]], then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting [[Hawking radiation]]. The [[entropy]] of the universe would increase to the point where no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death.&lt;ref name=dying&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adams |first1=Fred C. |last2=Laughlin |first2=Gregory |lastauthoramp=yes |title=A dying Universe: the long-term fate and evolution of astrophysical objects |pages=337–372 |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=69 |issue=2 |date=1997 |bibcode=1997RvMP...69..337A |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.69.337| arxiv=astro-ph/9701131}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|sec VI.D}}

Modern observations of accelerating expansion imply that more and more of the currently visible universe will pass beyond our [[event horizon]] and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The ΛCDM model of the universe contains dark energy in the form of a [[cosmological constant]]. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called [[phantom energy]] theories, suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and matter itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called [[Big Rip]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Misconceptions ==
The following is a partial list of misconceptions about the Big Bang model:

''The Big Bang as the origin of the universe:'' One of the common misconceptions about the Big Bang model is the belief that it was the origin of the universe. However, the Big Bang model does not comment about how the universe came into being. Current conception of the Big Bang model assumes the existence of energy, time, and space, and does not comment about their origin or the cause of the dense and high temperature initial state of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/seuforum/faq.htm|title=Brief Answers to Cosmic Questions|website=www.cfa.harvard.edu|access-date=2017-07-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413195349/https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/seuforum/faq.htm|archivedate=13 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Big Bang was "small"'': It is misleading to visualize the Big Bang by comparing its size to everyday objects. When the size of the universe at Big Bang is described, it refers to the size of the observable universe, and not the entire universe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Tamara M.|last2=Lineweaver|first2=Charles H.|date=January 2004|title=Expanding Confusion: Common Misconceptions of Cosmological Horizons and the Superluminal Expansion of the Universe|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/expanding-confusion-common-misconceptions-of-cosmological-horizons-and-the-superluminal-expansion-of-the-universe/EFEEEFD8D71E59F86DDA82FDF576EFD3|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia|volume=21|issue=1|pages=97–109|doi=10.1071/as03040|arxiv = astro-ph/0310808 |bibcode = 2004PASA...21...97D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Hubble's law]] violates the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]]'': Hubble's law predicts that galaxies that are beyond [[Hubble's law|Hubble Distance]] recede [[Faster-than-light|faster than the speed of light]]. However, special relativity does not apply beyond motion through space. Hubble's law describes velocity that results from expansion ''of'' space, rather than ''through'' space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''[[Doppler effect|Doppler redshift]] vs [[Cosmological redshift|cosmological red-shift]]'': Astronomers&amp;nbsp;often refer to the cosmological red-shift as a normal Doppler shift,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;which is a misconception. Although similar, the cosmological red-shift is not identical to the Doppler redshift. The Doppler redshift is based on special relativity, which does not consider the expansion of space. On the contrary, the cosmological red-shift is based on general relativity, in which the expansion of space is considered. Although they may appear identical for nearby galaxies, it may cause confusion if the behavior of distant galaxies is understood through the Doppler redshift.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Speculations ==
{{Main|Cosmogony}}

While the Big Bang model is well established in cosmology, it is likely to be refined. The Big Bang theory, built upon the equations of classical general relativity, indicates a [[essential singularity|singularity]] at the origin of cosmic time; this [[infinity#Physics|infinite]] [[energy density]] is regarded as impossible in [[experimental physics|physics]].  Still, it is known that the equations are not applicable before the time when the universe cooled down to the [[Planck temperature]], and this conclusion depends on various assumptions, of which some could never be experimentally verified. ''(Also see [[Planck epoch]].)''

One proposed refinement to avoid this would-be singularity is to develop a correct treatment of [[quantum gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;

It is not known what could have preceded the hot dense state of the early universe or how and why it originated, though speculation abounds in the field of [[cosmogony]].

Some proposals, each of which entails untested hypotheses, are:
* Models including the [[Hartle–Hawking state|Hartle–Hawking no-boundary condition]], in which the whole of space-time is finite; the Big Bang does represent the limit of time but without any singularity.&lt;ref&gt;

* Big Bang lattice model, states that the universe at the moment of the Big Bang consists of an infinite lattice of [[fermions]], which is smeared over the [[fundamental domain]] so it has rotational, translational and gauge symmetry. The symmetry is the largest symmetry possible and hence the lowest entropy of any state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* [[Brane cosmology]] models, in which inflation is due to the movement of branes in [[string theory]]; the pre-Big Bang model; the [[ekpyrotic]] model, in which the Big Bang is the result of a collision between branes; and the [[cyclic model]], a variant of the ekpyrotic model in which collisions occur periodically. In the latter model the Big Bang was preceded by a Big Crunch and the universe cycles from one process to the other.&lt;ref&gt;

In the [[history of science]], the '''clockwork universe''' compares the universe to a [[clockwork|mechanical clock]]. It continues ticking along, as a perfect machine, with its gears governed by the [[laws of physics]], making every aspect of the machine predictable.

== History ==

This idea was very popular among [[Deism|deists]]{{ref}} during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], when [[Isaac Newton]] derived his [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]], and showed that alongside the law of universal [[gravitation]], they could explain the behaviour of both [[motion (physics)|terrestrial objects]] and the [[solar system]].

A similar concept goes back, to [[Johannes de Sacrobosco|John of Sacrobosco's]] early 13th-century introduction to astronomy: ''[[De sphaera mundi|On the Sphere of the World]]''. In this widely popular medieval text, Sacrobosco spoke of the universe as the ''machina mundi'', the machine of the world, suggesting that the reported eclipse of the Sun at the crucifixion of Jesus was a disturbance of the order of that machine.&lt;ref&gt;John of Sacrbosco, ''On the Sphere'', quoted in Edward Grant, ''A Source Book in Medieval Science,'' (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Pr., 1974), p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to [[Gottfried Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Richard Danielson, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5YOEaO_KO_cC&amp;pg=PA246 The Book of the Cosmos: Imagining the Universe from Heraclitus to Hawking]'', [[Basic Books]], 2001 (p. 246)&lt;/ref&gt; a prominent supporter of the theory, in the [[Leibniz–Clarke correspondence]], [[Samuel Clarke]] wrote:

:"The Notion of the World's being a great Machine, going on without the Interposition of God, as a Clock continues to go without the Assistance of a Clockmaker; is the Notion of Materialism and Fate, and tends, (under pretence of making God a Supra-mundane Intelligence,) to exclude Providence and God's Government in reality out of the World."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Edward B. 1991. "Newton's rejection of the "Newtonian world view" : the role of divine will in Newton's natural philosophy." Science and Christian Belief 3, no. 2: 103-117. Clarke quotation taken from article.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 artist [[Tim Wetherell]] created a large wall piece for [[Questacon]] (The National Science and Technology centre in Canberra, Australia) representing the concept of the clockwork universe. This steel artwork contains moving gears, a working clock, and a movie of the [[lunar terminator]].

'''Colloid vibration current''' is an [[electroacoustic phenomena|electroacoustic phenomenon]] that arises when [[ultrasound]] propagates through a [[fluid]] that contains [[ions]] and either [[solid]] particles or [[emulsion]] droplets.&lt;ref name="Dukhin"&gt;Dukhin, A.S. and Goetz, P.J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8UwuPmWMbE0C&amp;printsec=frontcover "Ultrasound for characterizing colloids"], Elsevier, 2002 {{ISBN|0-444-51164-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[pressure gradient]] in an ultrasonic wave moves particles relative to the fluid. This motion disturbs the [[double layer (interfacial)|double layer]] that exists at the particle-fluid [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]]. The picture illustrates the mechanism of this distortion. Practically all particles in fluids carry a [[surface charge]]. This surface charge is screened with an equally charged diffuse layer; this structure is called the [[double layer (interfacial)|double layer]]. Ions of the diffuse layer are located in the fluid and can move with the fluid. Fluid motion relative to the particle drags these diffuse ions in the direction of one or the other of the particle's poles. The picture shows ions dragged towards the left hand pole. As a result of this drag, there is an excess of negative ions in the vicinity of the left hand pole and an excess of positive [[surface charge]] at the right hand pole. As a result of this charge excess, particles gain a [[Electric dipole moment|dipole moment]]. These dipole moments generate an electric field that in turn generates measurable electric current.&lt;ref name="Dukhin"/&gt; This phenomenon is widely used for measuring [[zeta potential]] in concentrated [[colloids]].

'''Cosmic latte''' is a name assigned to the average color of the [[universe]], found by a team of [[astronomers]] from [[Johns Hopkins University]]. In 2001, [[Karl Glazebrook]] and Ivan Baldry determined that the average color of the universe was a greenish white, but they soon corrected their analysis in a 2002 paper in which they reported that their survey of the light from over 200,000 [[galaxy|galaxies]] averaged to a slightly [[beige]]ish [[white]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baldry|first=Ivan K.|last2=Glazebrook|first2=Karl|last3=Baugh|first3=Carlton M.|last4=Bland‐hawthorn|first4=Joss|last5=Bridges|first5=Terry|last6=Cannon|first6=Russell|last7=Cole|first7=Shaun|last8=Colless|first8=Matthew|last9=Collins|first9=Chris|year=2002|title=The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey: Constraints on Cosmic Star Formation History from the Cosmic Spectrum|publisher=The American Astronomical Society|publication-date=20 April 2002|volume=569|issue=2|pages=582–594|doi=10.1086/339477|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|periodical=The Astrophysical Journal|arxiv=astro-ph/0110676|bibcode=2002ApJ...569..582B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hex Triplet|hex triplet]] value for cosmic latte is #FFF8E7.

==Discovery of the color==

Finding the average color of the universe was not the focus of the study. Rather, the study examined spectral analysis of different galaxies to study [[star]] formation. Like [[Fraunhofer lines]], the dark lines displayed in the study's spectral ranges display older and younger stars and allow Glazebrook and Baldry to determine the age of different galaxies and star systems. What the study revealed is that the overwhelming majority of stars formed about 5 billion years ago. Because these stars would have been "brighter" in the past, the color of the universe changes over time shifting from blue to red as more blue stars change to yellow and eventually [[red giants]].

As light from distant galaxies reaches the Earth, the average "color of the universe" (as seen from Earth) tends towards pure white, due to the light coming from the stars when they were much younger and bluer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/~ikb/Cosmic-Spectrum.html|title=The Cosmic Spectrum|last=Glazebrook|first=Karl|website=www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming of the color===
The corrected color was initially published on the Johns Hopkins News website and updated on the team's initial announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/~ikb/press/color.html|title=Headlines@Hopkins: Johns Hopkins University News Releases|website=www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple news outlets, including [[NPR]] and [[BBC News|BBC]], displayed the color in stories&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2002/jan/aas/020110.aas.html|title=NPR : The Color of the Universe Is...|last=Valentine|first=Vikki|website=www.npr.org|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some relayed the request by Glazebrook on the announcement asking for suggestions for names, jokingly adding all were welcome as long as they were not "beige".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1861957.stm|title=Universe is off colour|last=|first=|date=March 8, 2002|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2002/03/universe-beige-not-turquoise/|title=Universe: Beige, not Turquoise|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These were the results of a vote of the scientists involved based on the new color:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~kgb/cosspec/topten.htm|title=The Cosmic Spectrum|date=2002-10-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021005185037/http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~kgb/cosspec/topten.htm|archive-date=2002-10-05|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Drum's suggestion of "cappuccino cosmico" received the most votes, the researchers favored Drum's other suggestion, "cosmic latte". This is because the similar "Latteo" means "Milky" in Italian, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo's]] native language. It also leads to the similarity to the Italian term for the Milky Way, "Via Lattea", and they enjoyed the fact that the color would be similar to the Milky Way's average color as well, as it is part of the sum of the universe.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2002/07/01/science/6faba612-7ee5-49bf-a652-6a0eae42d7c5/|title=SCIENCE|date=2002-07-01|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also claimed to be "caffeine biased".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Drum came up with the name while sitting in a [[Starbucks]] drinking a [[latte]] and reading the ''Washington Post''. Drum noticed that the color of the universe as displayed in the newspaper was the same color as his latte.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

'''Cosmology''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] κόσμος, ''kosmos'' "world" and -λογία, ''-logia'' "study of") is the study of the [[Chronology of the universe|origin, evolution, and eventual fate]] of the [[universe]]. [[Physical cosmology]] is the scientific study of the universe's origin, its large-scale structures and dynamics, and its [[ultimate fate of the universe|ultimate fate,]] as well as the [[Laws of science|scientific laws]] that govern these areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9988-instant-expert-cosmology.html "Introduction: Cosmology – space"]. ''New Scientist''. 4 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''cosmology'' was first used in English in 1656 in [[Thomas Blount (lexicographer)|Thomas Blount]]'s ''Glossographia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Cosmology (Routledge Revivals): Historical, Philosophical, and Scientific Foundations of Modern Cosmology |first1=Norriss S. |last1=Hetherington |publisher=Routledge |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-317-67766-6 |page=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EP9QAwAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=EP9QAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116 Extract of page 116]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1731 taken up in Latin by [[German philosophy|German philosopher]] [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], in ''Cosmologia Generalis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Wraparound Universe |first1=Jean-Pierre |last1=Luminet |publisher=CRC Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4398-6496-8 |page=170 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PeDqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=PeDqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170 Extract of page 170]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Religious cosmology|Religious]] or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on [[Mythology|mythological]], [[Religion|religious]], and [[Esotericism|esoteric]] literature and traditions of [[creation myth]]s and [[eschatology]].

Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as [[Astronomy|astronomers]] and [[Physics|physicists]], as well as [[Philosophy|philosophers]], such as [[Metaphysics|metaphysicians]], [[Philosophy of physics|philosophers of physics]], and [[Philosophy of space and time|philosophers of space and time]].  Because of this shared scope with [[philosophy]], [[theory|theories]] in physical cosmology may include both [[science|scientific]] and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that cannot be [[hypothesis|tested]]. Cosmology differs from astronomy in that the former is concerned with the Universe as a whole while the latter deals with individual [[celestial object]]s. Modern physical cosmology is dominated by the [[Big Bang]] theory, which attempts to bring together [[observational astronomy]] and [[particle physics]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cosmology "Cosmology"] Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt; more specifically, a standard parameterization of the Big Bang with [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]], known as the [[Lambda-CDM]] model.

[[Astrophysics#Theoretical astrophysics|Theoretical astrophysicist]] [[David Spergel|David N. Spergel]] has described cosmology as a "historical science" because "when we look out in space, we look back in time" due to the finite nature of the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=[[David Spergel|David N. Spergel]] |title= Cosmology Today |journal=Daedalus |date=Fall 2014|volume=143|issue=4 |pages=125–133| doi = 10.1162/DAED_a_00312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Physics]] and [[astrophysics]] have played a central role in shaping the understanding of the universe through scientific observation and experiment. [[Physical cosmology]] was shaped through both mathematics and observation in an analysis of the whole universe. The universe is generally understood to have begun with the [[Big Bang]], followed almost instantaneously by [[cosmic inflation]]; an [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] from which the universe is thought to have emerged [[Age of the universe|13.799 ± 0.021]] [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] years ago.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2015|title=Planck 2015 results. XIII. Cosmological parameters (See Table 4 on page 31 of PDF)|arxiv=1502.01589|bibcode=2016A&amp;A...594A..13P|author=Planck Collaboration|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201525830|volume=594|issue=13|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|pages=A13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cosmogony]] studies the origin of the Universe, and [[cosmography]] maps the features of the Universe.

In [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]'s [[Encyclopédie]], cosmology is broken down into uranology (the science of the heavens), aerology (the science of the air), geology (the science of the continents), and hydrology (the science of waters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authors=  |title=Detailed Explanation of the System of Human Knowledge

Metaphysical cosmology has also been described as the placing of humans in the universe in relationship to all other entities. This is exemplified by [[Marcus Aurelius]]'s observation that a man's place in that relationship: "He who does not know what the world is does not know where he is, and he who does not know for what purpose the world exists, does not know who he is, nor what the world is."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = The thoughts of Marcus Aurelius Antonius viii. 52 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15877/15877-h/15877-h.htm#viii._52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical cosmology===
{{Main|Physical cosmology}}
Physical cosmology is the branch of physics and astrophysics that deals with the study of the physical origins and evolution of the Universe. It also includes the study of the nature of the Universe on a large scale. In its earliest form, it was what is now known as "[[celestial mechanics]]", the study of the [[celestial sphere|heavens]]. Greek philosophers [[Aristarchus of Samos]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Ptolemy]] proposed different cosmological theories. The [[geocentric]] [[Ptolemaic system]] was the prevailing theory until the 16th century when [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], and subsequently [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo Galilei]], proposed a [[heliocentric]] system. This is one of the most famous examples of [[epistemological rupture]] in physical cosmology.

[[File:PIA17993-DetectorsForInfantUniverseStudies-20140317.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Evidence of [[gravitational waves]] in the [[Big Bang|infant universe]] may have been uncovered by the microscopic examination of the [[focal plane]] of the [[BICEP2]] [[radio telescope]].&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140317" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140317" /&gt;]] 
[[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', published in 1687, was the first description of the [[law of universal gravitation]]. It provided a physical mechanism for [[Kepler's laws]] and also allowed the anomalies in previous systems, caused by gravitational interaction between the planets, to be resolved. A fundamental difference between Newton's cosmology and those preceding it was the [[Copernican principle]]—that the bodies on earth obey the same [[physical law]]s as all the celestial bodies. This was a crucial philosophical advance in physical cosmology.

Modern scientific cosmology is usually considered to have begun in 1917 with [[Albert Einstein]]'s publication of his final modification of [[general relativity]] in the paper "Cosmological Considerations of the General Theory of Relativity" (although this paper was not widely available outside of Germany until the end of [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]]). General relativity prompted [[cosmogony|cosmogonists]] such as [[Willem de Sitter]], [[Karl Schwarzschild]], and [[Arthur Eddington]] to explore its astronomical ramifications, which enhanced the ability of [[astronomy|astronomers]] to study very distant objects. Physicists began changing the assumption that the Universe was static and unchanging. In 1922 [[Alexander Friedmann]] introduced the idea of an expanding universe that contained moving matter. Around the same time (1917 to 1922) the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] took place, with early cosmologists such as [[Heber Curtis]] and [[Ernst Öpik]] determining that some [[nebula]]e seen in telescopes were separate galaxies far distant from our own.

{{Physical cosmology}}
In parallel to this dynamic approach to cosmology, one long-standing debate about the structure of the cosmos was coming to a climax. Mount Wilson astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]] championed the model of a cosmos made up of the [[Milky Way]] [[star system]] only; while [[Heber D. Curtis]] argued for the idea that spiral nebulae were star systems in their own right as island universes. This difference of ideas came to a climax with the organization of the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] on 26 April 1920 at the meeting of the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The debate was resolved when [[Edwin Hubble]] detected [[Cepheid Variables]] in the [[Andromeda galaxy]] in 1923 and 1924. Their distance established spiral nebulae well beyond the edge of the Milky Way&lt;!-- and has galaxies of their own--&gt;&lt;!--Somebody's editing mistake - check.--&gt;.

Subsequent modelling of the universe explored the possibility that the [[cosmological constant]], introduced by Einstein in his 1917 paper, may result in an [[expanding universe]], depending on its value. Thus the [[Big Bang]] model was proposed by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] priest [[Georges Lemaître]] in 1927 which was subsequently corroborated by [[Edwin Hubble]]'s discovery of the [[Redshift|red shift]] in 1929 and later by the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] by [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]] in 1964. These findings were a first step to rule out some of many [[Non-standard cosmology|alternative cosmologies]].

Since around 1990, several dramatic advances in observational cosmology have transformed cosmology from a largely speculative science into a predictive science with precise agreement between theory and observation. These advances include observations of the microwave background from the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]], [[WMAP]] and [[Planck spacecraft|Planck]] satellites,  large new galaxy [[redshift survey]]s including [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dfGRS]] and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]], and observations of distant [[supernovae]] and [[gravitational lensing]]. These observations matched the predictions of the [[cosmic inflation]] theory, a modified [[Big Bang]] theory, and the specific version known as the [[Lambda-CDM]] model.  This has led many to refer to modern times as the "golden age of cosmology".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Guth]] is reported to have made this very claim in an [[Edge Foundation, Inc.|Edge Foundation]] interview [http://www.edge.org/documents/day/day_guth.html EDGE]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious or mythological cosmology===
{{See also|Religious cosmology}}

[[Religious cosmology|Religious]] or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on [[Mythology|mythological]], [[Religion|religious]], and [[Esotericism|esoteric]] literature and traditions of [[Creation myth|creation]] and [[eschatology]].

===Philosophical cosmology===
{{See also|Cosmology (philosophy)}}

Cosmology deals with the world as the totality of space, time and all phenomena. Historically, it has had quite a broad scope, and in many cases was founded in religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crouch |first1=C. L. |title=Genesis 1:26-7 As a statement of humanity's divine parentage |date=8 February 2010 |journal=The Journal of Theological Studies |pages=1–15 |volume=61 |issue=1 |url=https://academic.oup.com/jts/article/61/1/1/1673983 |accessdate=17 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern use metaphysical cosmology addresses questions about the Universe which are beyond the scope of science. It is distinguished from religious cosmology in that it approaches these questions using philosophical methods like [[dialectic]]s. Modern metaphysical cosmology tries to address questions such as:&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/planck/publications#Planck2015|title=Publications - Cosmos|website=www.cosmos.esa.int|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* What is the origin of the Universe? What is its first cause? Is its existence necessary? (see [[monism]], [[pantheism]], [[emanationism]] and [[creationism]])
* What are the ultimate material components of the Universe? (see [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]], [[hylomorphism]], [[atomism]])
* What is the ultimate reason for the existence of the Universe? Does the cosmos have a purpose? (see [[teleology]])
* Does the existence of consciousness have a purpose? How do we know what we know about the totality of the cosmos? Does cosmological reasoning reveal metaphysical truths? (see [[epistemology]])

| [[Hindu cosmology]]
| [[Rigveda]] (c. 1700–1100 BC)
| Cyclical or oscillating, Infinite in time
| One cycle of existence is around 311 trillion years and the life of one universe around 8 billion years. This Universal cycle is preceded by an infinite number of universes and to be followed by another infinite number of universes. Includes an infinite number of universes at one given time.

|  [[Jain cosmology]]
|  [[Jain Agamas]] (written around 500 AD as per the teachings of [[Mahavira]] 599–527 BC)
|  Cyclical or oscillating, eternal and finite 
|  Jain cosmology considers the ''[[loka]]'', or universe, as an uncreated entity, existing since infinity, the shape of the universe as similar to a man standing with legs apart and arm resting on his waist. This Universe, according to [[Jainism]], is broad at the top, narrow at the middle and once again becomes broad at the bottom.

| [[Parmenides]] (c. 515 BC)
| Finite and spherical in extent
| The Universe is unchanging, uniform, perfect, necessary, timeless, and neither generated nor perishable. Void is impossible. Plurality and change are products of epistemic ignorance derived from sense experience. Temporal and spatial limits are arbitrary and relative to the Parmenidean whole.

| [[Atomism|Atomist universe]]
| [[Anaxagoras]] (500–428&amp;nbsp;BC) &amp; later [[Epicurus]]
| Infinite in extent
| The universe contains only two things: an infinite number of tiny seeds ([[atom]]s) and the void of infinite extent. All atoms are made of the same substance, but differ in size and shape. Objects are formed from atom aggregations and decay back into atoms. Incorporates [[Leucippus]]' principle of [[causality]]: "nothing happens at random; everything happens out of reason and necessity". The universe was not ruled by [[gods]].{{citation needed|reason=Ancient Greeks typically believed that nothing was random *because* there were gods – for instance, when you elected a leader by drawing straws, the person 'randomly' elected leader was the one chosen by the gods!  The random selection was intended to minimize human influence on the outcome of the election, not to eliminate the influence of mount olympus – which would have been considered impossible, by typical Greek thinkers at least.  Perhaps Anaxagoras was atypical in *that* way, as well as atypical in believing in some primitive version of the atomic theory, but methinks not.|date=January 2013}}

|-
| [[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic model]]
| [[Ptolemy]] (2nd century&amp;nbsp;AD)
| Geocentric (based on Aristotelian universe)
| Universe orbits around a stationary Earth. Planets move in circular [[epicycles]], each having a center that moved in a larger circular orbit (called an eccentric or a deferent) around a center-point near Earth. The use of [[equant]]s added another level of complexity and allowed astronomers to predict the positions of the planets.

| Infinite extent, infinite time, homogeneous, isotropic, non-hierarchical
| Rejects the idea of a hierarchical universe. Earth and Sun have no special properties in comparison with the other heavenly bodies. The void between the stars is filled with [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], and matter is composed of the same [[Classical element|four elements]] (water, earth, fire, and air), and is atomistic, animistic and intelligent.
|-
|Keplerian
| [[Johannes Kepler]] (1571–1630)

|-
| Hierarchical universe
| [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Lambert]], 18th century
| Static (evolving), steady state, infinite
| Matter is clustered on ever larger scales of hierarchy. Matter is endlessly recycled.
|-
| [[Static universe|Einstein Universe with a cosmological constant]]
| [[Albert Einstein]], 1917
| Static (nominally). Bounded (finite)
| "Matter without motion". Contains uniformly distributed matter. Uniformly curved spherical space; based on [[Riemann sphere|Riemann's hypersphere]]. Curvature is set equal to Λ. In effect Λ is equivalent to a repulsive force which counteracts gravity. Unstable.

| [[Willem de Sitter]], 1917
| [[Metric expansion of space|Expanding]] [[shape of the universe|flat space]].
Steady state.
Λ &gt; 0

| [[Alexander Friedmann]], 1924
| [[Hyperbolic space|Hyperbolic]] expanding space.
''k'' = &amp;minus;1 ; no Λ

|-
| Friedmann zero-curvature
| Einstein and De Sitter, 1932
| Expanding flat space
''k'' = 0 ; Λ = 0
Critical density
| Curvature constant ''k'' = 0. Said to be infinite (but ambiguous). "Unbounded cosmos of limited extent". Expands forever. "Simplest" of all known universes. Named after but not considered by Friedmann. Has a [[deceleration parameter|deceleration term]] ''q'' = 1/2, which means that its expansion rate slows down.
|-
| The original [[Big Bang]] (Friedmann-Lemaître)
| [[Georges Lemaître]] 1927–29
| Expansion
Λ &gt; 0 ; Λ &gt; |Gravity|
| Λ is positive and has a magnitude greater than gravity. Universe has initial high-density state ("primeval atom"). Followed by a two-stage expansion. Λ is used to destabilize the universe. (Lemaître is considered the father of the big bang model.)
|-
| [[Oscillating universe]] (Friedmann-Einstein)
| Favored by [[Alexander Friedmann|Friedmann]], 1920s
| Expanding and contracting in cycles
| Time is endless and beginningless; thus avoids the beginning-of-time paradox. Perpetual cycles of big bang followed by big crunch. (Einstein's first choice after he rejected his 1917 model.)

| [[Edward Arthur Milne|Edward Milne]], 1933, 1935;
[[William H. McCrea]], 1930s
| Kinematic expansion without space expansion
| Rejects general relativity and the expanding space paradigm. Gravity not included as initial assumption. Obeys cosmological principle and [[special relativity]]; consists of a finite spherical cloud of particles (or galaxies) that expands within an infinite and otherwise empty flat space. It has a center and a cosmic edge (surface of the particle cloud) that expands at light speed. Explanation of gravity was elaborate and unconvincing.
|-
| [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker]] class of models
| [[Howard Percy Robertson|Howard Robertson]], [[Arthur Geoffrey Walker|Arthur Walker]], 1935

| Steady-state
| [[Fred Hoyle]] 1948
| Expanding, steady state; but unstable

| [[Ambiplasma]]
| [[Hannes Alfvén]] 1965 [[Oskar Klein]]
| Cellular universe, expanding by means of matter–antimatter annihilation
| Based on the concept of [[plasma cosmology]]. The universe is viewed as "meta-galaxies" divided by [[Double layer (plasma)|double layers]] and thus a bubble-like nature. Other universes are formed from other bubbles. Ongoing cosmic matter-[[antimatter]] [[annihilation]]s keep the bubbles separated and moving apart preventing them from interacting.
|-
| [[Brans–Dicke theory]]
| [[Carl H. Brans]], [[Robert H. Dicke]]
| Expanding
| Based on [[Mach's principle]]. ''G'' varies with time as universe expands. "But nobody is quite sure what Mach's principle actually means."{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
|-
| [[Cosmic inflation]]
| [[Alan Guth]] 1980
| [[Big Bang]] modified  to solve [[horizon problem|horizon]] and [[flatness problem]]s
| Based on the concept of hot inflation. The universe is viewed as a multiple quantum flux – hence its bubble-like nature. Other universes are formed from other bubbles. Ongoing cosmic expansion kept the bubbles separated and moving apart.
|-
| [[Chaotic inflation theory|Eternal inflation]] (a multiple universe model)
| [[Andrei Linde|Andreï Linde]], 1983
| Big Bang with [[cosmic inflation]]
| [[Multiverse]] based on the concept of cold inflation, in which inflationary events occur at random each with independent initial conditions; some expand into bubble universes supposedly like our entire cosmos. Bubbles nucleate in a [[Quantum foam|spacetime foam]].
|-
| [[Cyclic model]]
| [[Paul Steinhardt]]; [[Neil Turok]] 2002

The '''cosmos''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|k|ɒ|z|m|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|-|m|oʊ|s}}) is the [[universe]]. Using the word ''cosmos'' rather than the word ''universe'' implies viewing the universe as a complex and orderly [[system]] or entity; the opposite of [[Chaos (cosmogony)| chaos]].&lt;ref&gt;

The cosmos, and our understanding of the reasons for its existence and significance, are studied in [[cosmology]] - a very broad discipline covering any scientific, religious, or philosophical contemplation of the cosmos and its nature, or reasons for existing. Religious and philosophical approaches may include in their concepts of the cosmos various spiritual entities or other matters deemed to exist outside our physical universe.

== Etymology ==
The [[philosopher]] [[Pythagoras]] first used the term ''cosmos'' ({{lang-grc|κόσμος}}) for the order of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iamblichus]], ''Pyth.'', β 59; [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] ΙΙ 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anaxagoras]] further introduced the concept of a Cosmic Mind (''[[Nous]]'') ordering all things (Aetius Ι 3.5).&lt;/ref&gt; The term became part of modern language in the 19th century when geographer–polymath [[Alexander von Humboldt]] resurrected the use of the word from the ancient Greek, assigned it to his five-volume treatise, ''[[Kosmos (Humboldt)|Kosmos]]'', which influenced modern and somewhat [[holism|holistic]] perception of the universe as one interacting [[entity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MfgpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe|last=Humboldt|first=Alexander von|last2=Paul|first2=Benjamin Horatio|last3=von)|first3=Wilhelm Humboldt (Freiherr|last4=Dallas|first4=William Sweetland|date=1860|publisher=Harper &amp; brothers|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humansandnature.org/introducing-humboldt-s-cosmos-article-26.php|title=Introducing Humboldt's Cosmos {{!}} Center for Humans &amp; Nature|website=Center for Humans &amp; Nature|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cosmology ==
[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|right|The Ancient and [[Medieval]] cosmos as depicted in [[Peter Apian]]'s ''Cosmographia'' (Antwerp, 1539).]]
[[Cosmology]] is the study of the cosmos, and in its broadest sense covers a variety of very different approaches: scientific, religious and philosophical. All cosmologies have in common an attempt to understand the implicit order within the whole of being. In this way, most religions and [[philosophy|philosophical]] systems have a cosmology.

When ''cosmology'' is used without a qualifier, it often signifies physical cosmology, unless the context makes clear that a different meaning is intended.

=== Physical cosmology ===
{{main|Cosmology}}
Physical cosmology (often simply described as 'cosmology') is the scientific study of the universe, from the beginning of its physical existence. It includes speculative concepts such as a multiverse, when these are being discussed. In [[physical cosmology]], the term ''cosmos'' is often used in a technical way, referring to a particular [[spacetime]] continuum within a (postulated) [[multiverse]]. Our particular cosmos, the [[observable universe]], is generally capitalized as ''the Cosmos''. 

In physical cosmology, the uncapitalized term '''cosmic''' signifies a subject with a relationship to the universe, such as 'cosmic time' (time since the [[Big Bang]]), '[[cosmic rays]]' (high energy particles or radiation detected from [[outer space|space]]), and '[[cosmic microwave background]]' (microwave radiation detectable from all directions in space).

According to [[wikisource:Author:Charles Peter Mason|Charles Peter Mason]] in [[William Smith (lexicographer)|Sir William Smith]] ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'' (1870, see book screenshot for full quote), [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] described the universe.&lt;ref name=CPM&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir William Smith|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology|year=1870|url=https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofgree03smituoft#page/304/|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Philolaus-and-Philomelus-Pythagorean-Book.jpg|thumb|upright|Excerpt from [[Philolaus]] Pythagoras book, (Charles Peter Mason, 1870)]]
{{quote|
It appears, in fact, from this, as well as from the extant fragments, that the first book (from [[Philolaus]]) of the work contained a general account of the origin and arrangement of the universe. The second book appears to have been an exposition of the nature of numbers, which in the Pythagorean theory are the essence and source of all things. (p. 305)}}

=== Philosophical cosmology ===
{{main|Philosophical cosmology}}
Cosmology is a branch of [[metaphysics]] that deals with the nature of the universe, a theory or doctrine describing the natural order of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cosmology|title=Definition of "Cosmology"|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic definition of Cosmology is the science of the origin and development of the universe. In modern astronomy the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]] is the dominant postulation.

=== Religious cosmology ===
{{see also|Religious cosmology|Hellenistic philosophy and Christianity|Orphism (religion)}}

In [[theology]], the cosmos is the [[Creation myth|created]] heavenly bodies (sun, moon, planets, and [[fixed stars]]). In [[Christian theology]], the word is also used synonymously with ''[[aeon|aion]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concerning Aion and Aionios|url=http://www.saviourofall.org/Writings/aion.html|publisher=Saviour of All Fellowship|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to "worldly life" or "this world" or "this age" as opposed to the [[afterlife]] or [[world to come]].

The 1870 book ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' noted&lt;ref name=CPM /&gt;
:[[Thales]] dogma that water is the origin of things, that is, that it is that out of which every thing arises, and into which every thing resolves itself, Thales may have followed Orphic cosmogonies, while, unlike them, he sought to establish the truth of the assertion. Hence, Aristotle, immediately after he has called him the originator of philosophy brings forward the reasons which Thales was believed to have adduced in confirmation of that assertion; for that no written development of it, or indeed any book by ''Thales'', was extant, is proved by the expressions which Aristotle uses when he brings forward the doctrines and proofs of the [[Miletus|Milesian]]. (p. 1016)

:[[Plato]], describes the idea of the good, or the Godhead, sometimes ''teleologically'', as the ultimate purpose of all conditioned existence; sometimes ''cosmologically'', as the ultimate operative cause; and has begun to develop the ''cosmological'', as also the physico-theological proof for the being of God; but has referred both back to the idea of the Good, as the necessary presupposition to all other ideas, and our cognition of them. (p. 402)

The book ''The Works of Aristotle'' (1908, p.&amp;nbsp;80 ''Fragments'') mentioned&lt;ref name=Aristotle1908&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/worksofaristotle12arisuoft|title=The Works of Aristotle|year=1908|author=Aristotle|author2=Ross, W. D. (William David), 1877|author3=Smith, J. A. (John Alexander), 1863-1939|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Aristotle says the poet ''Orpheus'' never existed; the Pythagoreans ascribe this Orphic poem to a certain ''Cercon'' (see [[Cercops]]).

[[Bertrand Russell]] (1947) noted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|title=History of Western Philosophy|year=1947|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The Orphics were an ascetic sect; wine, to them, was only a symbol, as, later, in the Christian sacrament. The intoxication that they sought was that of "enthusiasm," of union with the god. They believed themselves, in this way, to acquire mystic knowledge not obtainable by ordinary means. This mystical element entered into Greek philosophy with Pythagoras, who was a reformer of Orphism as Orpheus was a reformer of the religion of Dionysus. From Pythagoras Orphic elements entered into the philosophy of Plato, and from Plato into most later philosophy that was in any degree religious.

'''Debris''' or '''débris''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|d|ɛ|b|r|iː|,_|ˈ|d|eɪ|b|r|iː}}, {{IPAc-en|US|d|ə|ˈ|b|r|iː}}) is [[rubble]], wreckage, [[ruins]], [[litter]] and discarded [[waste|garbage/refuse/trash]], scattered remains of something destroyed, discarded, or as in geology, large rock fragments left by a melting glacier etc. Depending on context, ''debris'' can refer to a number of different things. The first apparent use of the French  word in English is in a 1701 description of the army of [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] upon its retreat from a battle with the army of Oliver Cromwell, in England.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, Sir Philip. (1701). Memoires of the Reigne of King Charles I: With a continuation to the happy restoration of King Charles II. London: Ri.Chiswell. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disaster==
In disaster scenarios, [[tornado]]s leave behind large pieces of houses and mass destruction overall. This debris also flies around the tornado itself when it is in progress. The tornado's winds capture debris it kicks up in its wind orbit, and spins it inside its vortex. The tornado's wind radius is larger than the funnel itself. tsunamis and hurricanes also bring large amounts of debris, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Earthquakes rock cities to rubble debris.

==Geological==
[[Image:ObsidianDomeCA.JPG|thumb|[[Obsidian]] debris (talus), Obsidian Dome, [[California]].]]
In [[geology]], debris usually applies to the remains of geological activity including [[landslide]]s, [[volcanic]] explosions, [[avalanches]], [[Mudslide|mudflows]] or [[Glacial lake outburst flood]]s (Jökulhlaups) and [[moraine]], [[lahars]], and [[lava]] eruptions. Geological debris sometimes moves in a [[stream]] called a [[debris flow]].  When it accumulates at the base of hillsides, it can be called "talus" or "[[scree]]".

In [[mining]], debris called ''attle'' usually consists of rock fragments which contain little or no ore.

==Marine==
{{Main|marine debris}}
[[Image:Marine debris on Hawaiian coast.jpg|thumb|[[Marine debris]] washed ashore on [[Hawaii]]]]
''Marine debris'' applies to floating garbage such as [[bottles]], [[Tin can|cans]], [[expanded polystyrene foam|styrofoam]], cruise [[ship]] waste, offshore [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[gas]] exploration and production facilities [[pollution]], and [[fishing]] paraphernalia from professional and recreational boaters. Marine debris is also called [[litter]] or [[flotsam and jetsam]]. Objects that can constitute marine debris include used [[automobile]] [[tires]], [[detergent]] [[bottles]], [[medical waste]]s, discarded fishing line and [[Net (device)|nets]], soda cans, and [[bilge]] waste solids.

In addition to being unsightly, it can pose a serious threat to marine life, [[boats]], [[human swimming|swimmers]], [[underwater diving|divers]], and others. For example, each year millions of seabirds, sea [[turtle]]s, [[fish]], and marine [[mammal]]s become entangled in marine debris, or ingest plastics which they have mistaken for food. As many as 30,000 northern fur seals per year get caught in abandoned fishing nets and either drown or suffocate. [[Whales]] mistake [[plastic]] bags for [[squid]], and [[birds]] may mistake plastic pellets for fish [[roe|eggs]]. At other times, animals accidentally eat the plastic while feeding on natural food.

The largest concentration of marine debris is the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

Marine debris most commonly originates from land-based sources. Various international agencies are currently working to reduce marine debris levels around the world.

==Meteorological==
In [[meteorology]], debris usually applies to the remains of [[human]] habitation and natural [[flora (plants)|flora]] after [[storm]] related destruction. This debris is also commonly referred to as '''storm debris'''. Storm debris commonly consists of roofing material, downed [[tree]] [[branch|limbs]], downed [[wikt:signs|signs]], downed [[power line]]s and poles, and wind-blown garbage. Storm debris can become a serious problem immediately after a storm, in that it often blocks access to individuals and communities that may require emergency services. This material frequently exists in such large quantities that disposing of it becomes a serious issue for a community. In addition, storm debris is often hazardous by its very nature, since, for example, downed power lines annually account for storm-related deaths.
{{See also|debris ball|road debris}}

==Space==
{{Main|space debris}}
''Space debris'' usually refers to the remains of [[spacecraft]] that have either fallen to [[Earth]] or are still orbiting Earth. Space debris may also consist of natural components such as chunks of [[rock (geology)|rock]] and [[ice]]. The problem of space debris has grown as various space programs have left legacies of launches, explosions, repairs, and discards in both low Earth [[orbit]] and more remote orbits. These orbiting fragments have reached a great enough proportion to constitute a hazard to future space launches of both [[satellite]] and manned vehicles. Various government agencies and international organizations are beginning to track space debris and also research possible solutions to the problem. While many of these  items, ranging in size from [[nut (hardware)|nut]]s and [[Screw|bolts]] to entire satellites and spacecraft, may fall to Earth, other items located in more remote orbits may stay aloft for centuries. The velocity of some of these pieces of space junk have been clocked in excess of 17,000 miles per hour (27,000&amp;nbsp;km/h). A piece of space debris falling to Earth leaves a fiery trail, just like a [[meteor]].

A [[debris disk]] is a circumstellar disk of dust and debris in orbit around a star.

==Surgical==
In [[medicine]], debris usually refers to biological matter that has accumulated or lodged in [[surgical instruments]] and is referred to as '''surgical debris'''. The presence of surgical debris can result in cross-infections or [[nosocomial infection]]s if not removed and the affected surgical instruments or equipment properly [[disinfect]]ed.

==War==
[[Image:Boys Toys edit.jpg|thumb|right|A child plays on an abandoned tank outside [[Phnom Penh]], [[Cambodia]] in 1991]]
In the aftermath of a war, large areas of the region of conflict are often strewn with ''war debris'' in the form of abandoned or destroyed hardware and vehicles, mines, [[unexploded ordnance]], bullet casings and other fragments of metal.

Much war debris has the potential to be lethal and continues to kill and maim civilian populations for years after the end of a conflict. The risks from war debris may be sufficiently high to prevent or delay the return of refugees. In addition war debris may contain hazardous chemicals or radioactive components that can contaminate the land or poison civilians who come into contact with it. Many [[Mine clearance agencies]] are also involved in the clearance of war debris.

[[Land mines]] in particular are very dangerous as they can remain active for decades after a conflict, which is why they have been banned by international war regulations.

In November 2006 the Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War (Protocol V to the 1980 Convention)
| year=2003
| publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross
| accessdate=2006-06-20
| url=http://www.icrc.org/IHL.nsf/FULL/610?OpenDocument
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
came into effect with 92 countries subscribing to the treaty that requires the parties involved in a conflict to assist with the removal of unexploded ordnance following the end of hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=War Debris Treaty To Come Into Force in November
| year=2006

| accessdate=2006-06-20
| url=http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?F=1803977&amp;C=mideast
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the countries most affected by war debris are [[Afghanistan]], [[Angola]], [[Cambodia]], [[Iraq]] and [[Laos]].

Similarly ''military debris'' may be found in and around [[firing range]]s and military training areas.

Debris can also be used as [[Cover (military)|cover]] for military purposes, depending on the situation.

==Culinary==
In South Louisiana's [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Creole]] and [[Cajun]] cultures, debris (pronounced "DAY-bree") refers to chopped organs such as liver, heart, kidneys, tripe, spleen, brain, lungs and pancreas.

==Chronology==
{{Main|History of Earth}}

===Formation===
[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of the early Solar System's planetary disk]]
The oldest material found in the [[Solar System]] is dated to {{val|4.5672|0.0006|ul=billion years ago}} (Bya).&lt;ref name=bowring_housch1995/&gt; By {{val|4.54|0.04|u=Bya}}&lt;ref name="age_earth1" /&gt; the primordial Earth had formed. The bodies in [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|the Solar System formed and evolved]] with the Sun. In theory, a [[solar nebula]] partitions a volume out of a [[molecular cloud]] by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a [[circumstellar disk]], and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and [[Cosmic dust|dust]] (including [[primordial nuclide]]s). According to [[nebular theory]], [[planetesimal]]s formed by [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]], with the primordial Earth taking 10–{{val|20|ul=million years}} (Mys) to form.&lt;ref name=nature418_6901_949/&gt;

A subject of research is the formation of the Moon, some 4.53 Bya.&lt;ref name=science310_5754_1671/&gt; A leading hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a [[Mars]]-sized object, named [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], [[giant impact hypothesis|hit]] Earth.&lt;ref name=reilly20091022/&gt; In this view, the mass of Theia was approximately 10 percent of Earth,&lt;ref name=canup_asphaug2001a/&gt; it hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with Earth.&lt;ref name=canup_asphaug2001b/&gt; Between approximately 4.1 and {{val|3.8|u=Bya}}, numerous [[Impact event|asteroid impacts]] during the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth.

===Geological history===
{{Main|Geological history of Earth}}
[[File:USA 10654 Bryce Canyon Luca Galuzzi 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Hoodoo (geology)|Hoodoos]] at the [[Bryce Canyon National Park]], [[Utah]]]]

Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by [[Volcano|volcanic activity]] and [[outgassing]]. Water vapor from these sources [[origin of the world's oceans|condensed]] into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, [[protoplanet]]s, and [[comet]]s.&lt;ref name="watersource"/&gt; In [[faint young Sun paradox|this model]], atmospheric "[[greenhouse gas]]es" kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its [[solar luminosity|current luminosity]].&lt;ref name=asp2002/&gt; By {{val|3.5|u=Bya}}, [[Earth's magnetic field]] was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the [[solar wind]].&lt;ref name=physorg20100304/&gt;

A crust formed when the molten outer layer of Earth cooled [[Phase transition|to form]] a solid. The two models&lt;ref name=williams_santosh2004/&gt; that explain land mass propose either a steady growth to the present-day forms&lt;ref name=science164_1229/&gt; or, more likely, a rapid growth&lt;ref name=tp322_19/&gt; early in Earth history&lt;ref name=rg6_175/&gt; followed by a long-term steady continental area.&lt;ref name=science310_5756_1947/&gt;&lt;ref name=jaes23_799/&gt;&lt;ref name=ajes38_613/&gt; Continents formed by [[plate tectonics]], a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior. Over [[Geologic time scale|the period]] of hundreds of millions of years, the [[supercontinent]]s have assembled and broken apart. Roughly {{val|750|u=million years ago}} (Mya), one of the earliest known supercontinents, [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]] {{val|600|–|540|u=Mya}}, then finally [[Pangaea]], which also broke apart {{val|180|u=Mya}}.&lt;ref name=as92_324/&gt;

The present pattern of [[ice age]]s began about {{val|40|u=Mya}} and then intensified during the [[Pleistocene]] about {{val|3|u=Mya}}. High-[[latitude]] regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every {{val|40000|-|100000|u=years|fmt=commas}}. The last continental glaciation ended {{val|10000|u=years|fmt=commas}} ago.&lt;ref name=psc/&gt;

During the [[Neoproterozoic]], {{val|750|to|580|u=Mya}}, much of Earth might have been covered in ice. This hypothesis has been termed "[[Snowball Earth]]", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the [[Cambrian explosion]], when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity.&lt;ref name=kirschvink1992/&gt; Following the Cambrian explosion, {{val|535|u=Mya}}, there have been five [[Extinction event|mass extinctions]].&lt;ref name="sci215_4539_1501" /&gt; The [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event|most recent such event]] was {{val|66|u=Mya}}, when [[Chicxulub impactor|an asteroid impact]] triggered the extinction of the non-[[bird|avian]] [[dinosaur]]s and other large reptiles, but spared some small animals such as [[mammal]]s, which at the time resembled [[shrew]]s. Mammalian life has diversified over the past {{val|66|u=Mys}}, and several million years ago an African ape-like animal such as ''[[Orrorin tugenensis]]'' gained the ability to stand upright.&lt;ref name="gould1994" /&gt; This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which led to the [[Human evolution|evolution of humans]].

===Future===
{{Main|Future of Earth}}
{{See also|Global catastrophic risk}}
Earth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next {{val|1.1|u=Bys}}, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next {{val|3.5|u=Bys}} by 40%.&lt;ref name="sun_future"/&gt; The Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the [[inorganic]] [[carbon cycle]], reducing [[Carbon dioxide|{{chem2|CO2}}]] concentration to levels lethally low for plants ({{val|10|ul=ppm}} for [[C4 carbon fixation|C4 photosynthesis]]) in approximately {{val|500|–|900|u=Mys}}.&lt;ref name="britt2000" /&gt; The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making animal life impossible.&lt;ref name=ward_brownlee2002/&gt; After another billion years all surface water will have disappeared&lt;ref name=carrington/&gt; and the mean global temperature will reach {{convert|70|C|F|0}}.&lt;ref name=ward_brownlee2002/&gt; From that point, the Earth is expected to be habitable for another {{val|500|u=Myr}},&lt;ref name="britt2000"/&gt; possibly up to {{val|2.3|u=Ga}} if nitrogen is removed from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=pnas1_24_9576/&gt; Even if the Sun were eternal and stable, 27% of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] in one billion years, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.&lt;ref name=hess5_4_569/&gt;

The Sun will [[stellar evolution|evolve]] to become a [[red giant]] in about {{val|5|u=Bys}}. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly {{convert|1|AU|e6km e6mi|lk=in|abbr=unit}}, about 250 times its present radius.&lt;ref name="sun_future" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sun_future_schroder"/&gt; Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit {{convert|1.7|AU|e6km e6mi|lk=off|abbr=unit}} from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius. Most, if not all, remaining life will be destroyed by the Sun's increased luminosity (peaking at about 5,000 times its present level).&lt;ref name="sun_future" /&gt; A 2008 simulation indicates that Earth's orbit will eventually decay due to [[Tidal acceleration|tidal effects]] and drag, causing it to enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.&lt;ref name="sun_future_schroder" /&gt;

{{Main|Figure of the Earth|Earth radius}}
The shape of Earth is approximately [[oblate spheroid]]al. Due to [[rotation]], the Earth is flattened at the poles and [[equatorial bulge|bulging]] around the [[equator]].&lt;ref name=milbert_smith96/&gt; The diameter of the Earth at the equator is {{convert|43|km|mi}} larger than the [[Geographical pole|pole]]-to-pole diameter.&lt;ref name="ngdc2006"/&gt; Thus the point on the surface farthest from Earth's [[center of mass]] is the summit of the equatorial [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] volcano in [[Ecuador]].&lt;ref name=ps20_5_16/&gt;&lt;ref name=lancet365_9462_831/&gt;&lt;ref name=tall_tales/&gt;&lt;ref name="The 'Highest' Spot on Earth"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9428163 |title=The 'Highest' Spot on Earth |publisher=NPR |date=7 April 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average diameter of the reference spheroid is {{convert|12742|km|mi}}. Local [[topography]] deviates from this idealized spheroid, although on a global scale these deviations are small compared to Earth's radius: The maximum deviation of only 0.17% is at the [[Mariana Trench]] ({{convert|10911|m|ft}} below local sea level), whereas [[Mount Everest]] ({{convert|8848|m|ft}} above local sea level) represents a deviation of 0.14%.{{refn|group=n| If Earth were shrunk to the size of a [[billiard ball]], some areas of Earth such as large mountain ranges and oceanic trenches would feel like tiny imperfections, whereas much of the planet, including the [[Great Plains]] and the [[abyssal plain]]s, would feel smoother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://billiards.colostate.edu/bd_articles/2013/june13.pdf |title=Is a Pool Ball Smoother than the Earth? |publisher=Billiards Digest |date=1 June 2013 |accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[geodesy]], the exact shape that Earth's oceans would adopt in the absence of land and perturbations such as tides and winds is called the [[geoid]]. More precisely, the geoid is the surface of gravitational equipotential at [[mean sea level]].

[[Earth mass|Earth's mass]] is approximately {{val|5.97|e=24|ul=kg}} (5,970 [[yottagram|Yg]]). It is composed mostly of [[iron]] (32.1%), [[oxygen]] (30.1%), [[silicon]] (15.1%), [[magnesium]] (13.9%), [[sulfur]] (2.9%), [[nickel]] (1.8%), [[calcium]] (1.5%), and [[aluminium]] (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to [[mass segregation]], the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.&lt;ref name=pnas71_12_6973/&gt;

The most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all [[oxide]]s: chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%. Over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash, and soda.&lt;ref name=brown_mussett1981/&gt;&lt;ref name=pnas71_12_6973/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|title=Petrology |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal structure===
{{Main|Structure of the Earth}}
Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their [[chemical]] or physical ([[Rheology|rheological]]) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct [[Silicate minerals|silicate]] solid crust, which is underlain by a highly [[viscous]] solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the [[Mohorovičić discontinuity]]. The thickness of the crust varies from about {{convert|6|km|mi}} under the oceans to {{convert|30|-|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the [[upper mantle]] are collectively known as the lithosphere, and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are composed. Beneath the lithosphere is the [[asthenosphere]], a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at {{convert|410|and|660|km|mi|abbr=on}} below the surface, spanning a [[Transition zone (Earth)|transition zone]] that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid [[outer core]] lies above a solid [[inner core]].&lt;ref name=tanimoto_ahrens1995/&gt; The Earth's inner core might rotate at a slightly higher [[angular velocity]] than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1–0.5° per year.&lt;ref name=science309_5739_1313/&gt; The radius of the inner core is about one fifth of that of Earth.

===Heat===
{{Main|Earth's internal heat budget}}
Earth's [[internal heat]] comes from a combination of residual heat from [[planetary accretion]] (about 20%) and heat produced through [[radioactive decay]] (80%).&lt;ref name="turcotte"/&gt; The major heat-producing [[isotope]]s within Earth are [[potassium-40]], [[uranium-238]], and [[thorium-232]].&lt;ref name=sanders20031210/&gt; At the center, the temperature may be up to {{convert|6000|C|F}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Earth's Centre is 1000 Degrees Hotter than Previously Thought |url=http://www.esrf.eu/news/general/Earth-Center-Hotter |website=The European Synchrotron (ESRF) |accessdate=12 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HKckNXMF?url=http://www.esrf.eu/news/general/Earth-Center-Hotter/Earth-Centre-Hotter |archivedate=12 June 2013 |date=25 April 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the pressure could reach {{convert|360|GPa|e6psi|abbr=unit|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=ptrsl360_1795_1227/&gt; Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately {{val|3|ul=Gyr}}, twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of [[mantle convection]] and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as [[komatiite]]s that are rarely formed today.&lt;ref name="turcotte" /&gt;&lt;ref name=epsl121_1/&gt;

These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types: At [[Convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], two plates come together; at [[Divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], two plates are pulled apart; and at [[Transform boundary|transform boundaries]], two plates slide past one another laterally. Along these plate boundaries, [[earthquake]]s, [[Volcanism|volcanic activity]], [[Orogeny|mountain-building]], and [[oceanic trench]] formation can occur.&lt;ref name=kious_tilling1999/&gt; The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.&lt;ref name=seligman2008/&gt;

[[File:Mount-Everest.jpg|thumb|left|[[Orogeny|Mountains build up]] when tectonic plates move toward each other, forcing rock up. The highest [[mountain]] on Earth above sea level is [[Mount Everest]].]]

As the tectonic plates migrate, oceanic crust is [[Subduction|subducted]] under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries. At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes recycles the [[oceanic crust]] back into the mantle. Due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than {{val|100|u=Myr}} old. The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific and is estimated to be {{val|200|u=Myr}} old.&lt;ref name=duennebier1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=noaa20070307/&gt; By comparison, the oldest dated [[continental crust]] is {{val|4030|u=Myr|fmt=commas}}.&lt;ref name=cmp134_3/&gt;

The seven major plates are the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]], [[North American Plate|North American]], [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]], [[African Plate|African]], [[Antarctic Plate|Antarctic]], [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australian]], and [[South American Plate|South American]]. Other notable plates include the [[Arabian Plate]], the [[Caribbean Plate]], the [[Nazca Plate]] off the west coast of South America and the [[Scotia Plate]] in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The Australian Plate fused with the Indian Plate between {{val|50|and|55|u=Mya}}. The fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the [[Cocos Plate]] advancing at a rate of {{convert|75|mm/year|in/year|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=podp2000/&gt; and the Pacific Plate moving {{convert|52|–|69|mm/year|in/year|abbr=on}}. At the other extreme, the slowest-moving plate is the Eurasian Plate, progressing at a typical rate of {{convert|21|mm/year|in/year|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=gps_time_series/&gt;

The continental crust consists of lower density material such as the igneous rocks [[granite]] and [[andesite]]. Less common is [[basalt]], a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors.&lt;ref name=layers_earth/&gt; [[Sedimentary rock]] is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and [[Diagenesis|compacted together]]. Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the crust.&lt;ref name=jessey/&gt; The third form of rock material found on Earth is [[metamorphic rock]], which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both.

[[File:Earth elevation histogram 2.svg|thumb|Elevation histogram of Earth's surface]]
The abundance of water on Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes the "Blue Planet" from other planets in the Solar System. Earth's hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans, but technically includes all water surfaces in the world, including inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The deepest underwater location is [[Challenger Deep]] of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean with a depth of {{convert|10911.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref group="n" name="trench_depth"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiko7000/&gt;

The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35{{e|18}}&amp;nbsp;[[metric ton]]s or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass. The oceans cover an area of {{convert|361.8|e6km2|e6mi2|abbr=unit}} with a mean depth of {{convert|3682|m|ft|abbr=on}}, resulting in an estimated volume of {{convert|1.332|e9km3|e6cumi|abbr=unit}}.&lt;ref name=ocean23_2_112/&gt; If all of Earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be {{convert|2.7|to|2.8|km|mi|2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/559627/sphere-depth-of-the-ocean |title=sphere depth of the ocean&amp;nbsp;– hydrology |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ase.tufts.edu/cosmos/print_chapter.asp?id=4 |title=Third rock from the Sun&amp;nbsp;– restless Earth |work=NASA's Cosmos |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 97.5% of the water is [[saline water|saline]]; the remaining 2.5% is [[fresh water]]. Most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in [[ice cap]]s and [[glacier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/earthwherewater.html |title=The World's Water |last1=Perlman |first1=Howard |date=17 March 2014 |accessdate=12 April 2015 |work=USGS Water-Science School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average [[salinity]] of Earth's oceans is about 35&amp;nbsp;grams of salt per kilogram of sea water (3.5% salt).&lt;ref name=kennish2001/&gt; Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks.&lt;ref name=mullen2002/&gt; The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms.&lt;ref name=natsci_oxy4/&gt; Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large [[heat reservoir]].&lt;ref name=michon2006/&gt; Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]].&lt;ref name=sample2005/&gt;

Earth's [[biosphere]] has significantly altered its [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]. [[Oxygen evolution#Oxygen evolution in nature|Oxygenic photosynthesis]] evolved {{val|2.7|u=Gya}}, [[oxygen catastrophe|forming]] the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today.&lt;ref name="NYT-20131003" /&gt; This change enabled the proliferation of [[aerobic organisms]] and, indirectly, the formation of the [[ozone layer]] due to the subsequent [[Ozone–oxygen cycle|conversion of atmospheric {{chem2|O2}} into {{chem2|O3}}]]. The ozone layer blocks [[ultraviolet]] [[solar radiation]], permitting life on land.&lt;ref name="Harrison 2002"/&gt; Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small [[meteor]]s to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature.&lt;ref name="atmosphere"/&gt; This last phenomenon is known as the [[greenhouse effect]]: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture [[thermal energy]] emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, [[methane]], [[nitrous oxide]], and [[ozone]] are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be {{convert|−18|C|F}}, in contrast to the current {{convert|+15|C|F}},&lt;ref name="Pidwirny2006_7" /&gt; and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.&lt;ref name=Narottam2008/&gt; In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be [[Reflection (physics)|reflected light]] from [[ice crystals]] in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170519"&gt;{{cite news |last=St. Fleur |first=Nicholas |title=Spotting Mysterious Twinkles on Earth From a Million Miles Away |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/science/dscovr-satellite-ice-glints-earth-atmosphere.html |date=19 May 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GRL-201760515"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marshak |first1=Alexander |last2=Várnai |first2=Tamás |last3=Kostinski |first3=Alexander |title=Terrestrial glint seen from deep space: oriented ice crystals detected from the Lagrangian point |date=15 May 2017 |journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]] |doi=10.1002/2017GL073248 |volume=44 |issue=10 |pages=5197–5202 |bibcode=2017GeoRL..44.5197M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, slowly becoming thinner and fading into outer space. Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the surface. This lowest layer is called the troposphere. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is [[atmospheric circulation]] that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.&lt;ref name="moran2005"/&gt;

The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the [[trade winds]] in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the [[westerlies]] in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°.&lt;ref name="berger2002"/&gt; [[Ocean current]]s are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the [[thermohaline circulation]] that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.&lt;ref name=rahmstorf2003/&gt;

Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation.&lt;ref name="moran2005" /&gt; Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This [[water cycle]] is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.&lt;ref name=hydrologic_cycle/&gt;

The amount of solar energy reaching Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about {{convert|0.4|C-change|F-change|1}} per degree of latitude from the equator.&lt;ref name=sadava_heller2006/&gt; Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the [[Tropics|tropical]] (or equatorial), [[Subtropics|subtropical]], [[temperate]] and [[Polar region|polar]] climates.&lt;ref name=climate_zones/&gt;

This latitudinal rule has several anomalies:
* Proximity to oceans moderates the climate. For example, the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]] has more moderate climate than similarly northern latitudes of [[northern Canada]].
* The [[wind]] enables this moderating effect. The windward side of a land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side. In the Northern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is west-to-east, and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts. This is seen in Eastern North America and Western Europe, where rough continental climates appear on the east coast on parallels with mild climates on the other side of the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/13573-east-coast-colder-europe-west-coast.html |title=Why U.S. East Coast is colder than Europe's West Coast |publisher=Live Science |date=5 April 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Southern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is east-to-west, and the eastern coasts are milder.
* The distance from the Earth to the Sun varies. The Earth is closest to the Sun (at [[perihelion]]) in January, which is summer in the Southern Hemisphere. It is furthest away (at [[aphelion]]) in July, which is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, and only 93.55% of the solar radiation from the Sun falls on a given square area of land than at perihelion. Despite this, there are larger land masses in the Northern Hemisphere, which are easier to heat than the seas. Consequently, summers are {{convert|2.3|C-change|F-change|0}} warmer in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere under similar conditions.&lt;ref name="Earth at Aphelion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceweather.com/glossary/aphelion.html |title=Earth at Aphelion |publisher=Space Weather |date=July 2008 |accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The climate is colder at high altitudes than at sea level because of the decreased air density.

The commonly used [[Köppen climate classification]] system has five broad groups ([[tropical climate|humid tropics]], [[arid]], [[humid subtropical climate|humid middle latitudes]], [[Continental climate|continental]] and cold [[polar climate|polar]]), which are further divided into more specific subtypes.&lt;ref name="berger2002" /&gt; The Köppen system rates regions of terrain based on observed temperature and precipitation.

The highest air temperature ever measured on Earth was {{convert|56.7|C|F}} in [[Furnace Creek, California]], in [[Death Valley National Park|Death Valley]], in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/highest-recorded-temperature/ |title=Highest recorded temperature |publisher=Guinness World Records |accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest air temperature ever directly measured on Earth was {{convert|-89.2|C|F}} at [[Vostok Station]] in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lyons |first1=Walter A |title=The Handy Weather Answer Book |date=1997 |publisher=Visible Ink Press |location=Detroit, Michigan |isbn=978-0-7876-1034-0 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; but satellites have used remote sensing to measure temperatures as low as {{convert|-94.7|C|F}} in [[East Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/coldest-temperature-recorded-earth-antarctica-guinness-book |title=Coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth in Antarctica |journal=The Guardian |date=10 December 2013 |accessdate=12 July 2015|publisher=Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; These temperature records are only measurements made with modern instruments from the 20th century onwards and likely do not reflect the full range of temperature on Earth.

====Upper atmosphere====
[[File:Full moon partially obscured by atmosphere.jpg|thumb|This view from orbit shows the [[full moon]] partially obscured by Earth's atmosphere.]]
Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the [[stratosphere]], [[mesosphere]], and [[thermosphere]].&lt;ref name="atmosphere" /&gt; Each layer has a different [[lapse rate]], defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the [[exosphere]] thins out into the [[magnetosphere]], where the geomagnetic fields interact with the [[solar wind]].&lt;ref name=sciweek2004/&gt; Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The [[Kármán line]], defined as 100&amp;nbsp;km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and [[outer space]].&lt;ref name=cordoba2004/&gt;

Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady [[Atmospheric escape|loss of the atmosphere into space]]. Because unfixed [[hydrogen]] has a low [[molecular mass]], it can achieve [[escape velocity]] more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases.&lt;ref name=jas31_4_1118/&gt; The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially [[redox|reducing]] state to its current [[Redox|oxidizing]] one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=sci293_5531_839/&gt; Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth.&lt;ref name=abedon1997/&gt; In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.&lt;ref name=arwps4_265/&gt;

The [[gravity of Earth]] is the [[acceleration]] that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within the Earth. Near the Earth's surface, [[gravitational acceleration]] is approximately {{convert|9.8|m/s2|abbr=on}}. Local differences in [[topography]], [[geology]], and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad, regional differences in the Earth's gravitational field, known as [[Gravity anomaly|gravity anomalies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A.

===Magnetic field===
{{Main|Earth's magnetic field}}

The main part of [[Earth's magnetic field]] is generated in the core, the site of a [[Dynamo theory|dynamo]] process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy. The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a [[dipole]]. The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is {{nowrap|3.05 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; [[Tesla (unit)|T]]}}, with global [[magnetic dipole moment]] of {{nowrap|7.91 × 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; T m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=lang2003/&gt; The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. This causes [[Geomagnetic secular variation|secular variation]] of the main field and [[geomagnetic reversal|field reversals]] at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years. The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=fitzpatrick2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=campbelwh/&gt;

The extent of Earth's magnetic field in space defines the [[magnetosphere]].

==Orbit and rotation==

===Rotation===
{{Main|Earth's rotation}}
[[File:EpicEarth-Globespin(2016May29).gif|thumb|right|Earth's rotation imaged by [[Deep Space Climate Observatory|DSCOVR EPIC]] on 29 May 2016, a few weeks before the [[solstice]].]]
Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is {{nowrap|86,400 seconds}} of mean solar time ({{nowrap|86,400.0025 [[SI]] seconds}}).&lt;ref name=aj136_5_1906/&gt; Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to [[tidal acceleration|tidal deceleration]], each day varies between {{nowrap|0 and 2 SI [[millisecond|ms]]}} longer&lt;!--than the previous day or the 19th-C day?  This construction is ambiguous--&gt;.&lt;ref name=USNO_TSD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rapid Service/Prediction of Earth Orientation |journal=IERS Bulletin-A |date=9 April 2015 |volume=28 |issue=15 |url=http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/ser7.dat |accessdate=12 April 2015 |format=.DAT file (displays as plaintext in browser)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth's rotation period relative to the [[fixed star]]s, called its ''stellar day'' by the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] (IERS), is {{nowrap|86,164.0989 seconds}} of mean solar time (UT1), or {{nowrap |23{{smallsup|h}} 56{{smallsup|m}} 4.0989{{smallsup|s}}.}}&lt;ref name=IERS/&gt;&lt;ref group="n" name="Aoki"/&gt; Earth's rotation period relative to the [[precession (astronomy)|precessing]] or moving mean [[vernal equinox]], misnamed its ''[[sidereal day]]'', is {{nowrap|86,164.0905 seconds}} of mean solar time (UT1) {{nowrap|(23{{smallsup|h}} 56{{smallsup|m}} 4.0905{{smallsup|s}})}}.&lt;ref name=IERS/&gt; Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4&amp;nbsp;ms.&lt;ref name=seidelmann1992/&gt; The length of the mean solar day in SI seconds is available from the IERS for the periods 1623–2005&lt;ref name=iers1623/&gt; and 1962–2005.&lt;ref name=iers1962/&gt;

Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at a rate of 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the [[celestial equator]], this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.&lt;ref name=zeilik1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=angular/&gt;

===Orbit===
{{Main|Earth's orbit}}
[[File:Pale Blue Dot.png|thumb|upright|The ''[[Pale Blue Dot]]'' photo taken in 1990 by the ''[[Voyager 1]]'' spacecraft showing Earth (center right) from nearly {{convert|4|e9mi|e9km|order=flip|abbr=unit}} away]]

Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about {{convert|150|e6km|e6mi|abbr=unit}} every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one [[sidereal year]]. This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1°/day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12&amp;nbsp;hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24&amp;nbsp;hours—a [[Solar time|solar day]]—for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]. The orbital speed of Earth averages about {{convert|29.78|km/s|km/h mph|abbr=on}}, which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter, about {{convert|12742|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, {{convert|384000|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in about 3.5 hours.&lt;ref name="earth_fact_sheet" /&gt;

The Moon and Earth orbit a common [[barycenter]] every 27.32&amp;nbsp;days relative to the background stars. When combined with the Earth–Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, the period of the [[synodic month]], from new moon to new moon, is 29.53&amp;nbsp;days. Viewed from the [[celestial pole|celestial north pole]], the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all [[counterclockwise]]. Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's [[axial tilt|axis is tilted]] some 23.44&amp;nbsp;degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the [[ecliptic]]), and the Earth–Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1&amp;nbsp;degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between [[lunar eclipse]]s and [[solar eclipse]]s.&lt;ref name="earth_fact_sheet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moon_fact_sheet" /&gt;

The [[Hill sphere]], or the sphere of [[Gravity|gravitational]] influence, of the Earth is about {{convert|1.5|e6km|mi|abbr=unit}} in radius.&lt;ref name=vazquez_etal2006 /&gt;&lt;ref group="n" name="hill_radius" /&gt; This is the maximum distance at which the Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit the Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.

Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the [[Milky Way]] and orbits about 28,000&amp;nbsp;[[light-year]]s from its center. It is about 20&amp;nbsp;light-years above the [[galactic plane]] in the [[Orion Arm]].&lt;ref name=nasa20051201 /&gt;

===Axial tilt and seasons===
{{Main|Axial tilt#Earth}}
[[File:AxialTiltObliquity.png|thumb|left|Earth's axial tilt (or [[obliquity]]) and its relation to the [[Rotation|rotation axis]] and [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|plane of orbit]]]]
The axial tilt of the Earth is approximately 23.439281°&lt;ref name="IERS"/&gt; with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the [[Celestial Poles]]. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with [[summer]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] occurring when the [[Tropic of Cancer]] is facing the Sun, and [[winter]] taking place when the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] faces the Sun. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. In northern temperate latitudes, the Sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the winter. The Sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west.

Above the [[Arctic Circle]], an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year, up to six months at the North Pole itself, a [[polar night]]. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is exactly reversed, with the [[South Pole]] oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole. Six months later, this pole will experience a [[midnight sun]], a day of 24 hours, again reversing with the South Pole.

By astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the [[solstice]]s—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the [[equinox]]es, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular. In the Northern Hemisphere, [[winter solstice]] currently occurs around 21 December; [[summer solstice]] is near 21 June, [[spring equinox]] is around 20 March and [[autumnal equinox]] is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.&lt;ref name=bromberg2008/&gt;

The angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo [[nutation]]; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=lin2006/&gt; The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, [[precession|precessing]] around in a complete circle over each 25,800&amp;nbsp;year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a [[tropical year]]. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This [[polar motion]] has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed [[quasiperiodic motion]]. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the [[Chandler wobble]]. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.&lt;ref name=fisher19960205/&gt;

In modern times, Earth's [[perihelion]] occurs around 3 January, and its [[aphelion]] around 4 July. These dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as [[Milankovitch cycles]]. The changing Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9%&lt;ref group="n" name="solar_energy"/&gt; in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref name=williams20051230/&gt;

A study from 2016 suggested that [[Planet Nine]] tilted all [[Solar System]] planets, including Earth's, by about six degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.space.com/34448-planet-nine-solar-system-tilt.html |title=Did the Mysterious 'Planet Nine' Tilt the Solar System? |work=Space.com |first=Charles Q. |last=Choi |date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitability==
[[File:Moraine Lake 17092005.jpg|thumb|The [[Rocky Mountains]] in Canada overlook [[Moraine Lake]].]]
A planet that can sustain life is termed [[Planetary habitability|habitable]], even if life did not originate there. Earth provides liquid water—an environment where complex [[Organic compound|organic molecules]] can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain [[metabolism]].&lt;ref name=ab2003/&gt; The distance of Earth from the Sun, as well as its orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere, and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface.&lt;ref name=dole1970/&gt;

===Biosphere===
{{Main|Biosphere}}
A planet's life forms inhabit [[ecosystem]]s, whose total is sometimes said to form a "biosphere". Earth's biosphere is thought to have begun [[evolution|evolving]] about {{val|3.5|u=Gya}}.&lt;ref name="NYT-20131003" /&gt; The biosphere is divided into a number of [[biome]]s, inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals. On land, biomes are separated primarily by differences in latitude, [[elevation|height above sea level]] and [[humidity]]. Terrestrial [[tundra|biomes]] lying within the Arctic or [[Antarctic Circle]]s, at [[Alpine tundra|high altitudes]] or in [[desert|extremely arid areas]] are relatively barren of plant and animal life; [[Latitudinal gradients in species diversity|species diversity]] reaches a peak in [[tropical rainforest|humid lowlands at equatorial latitudes]].&lt;ref name=amnat163_2_192/&gt;

In July 2016, scientists reported identifying a set of 355 [[gene]]s from the [[last universal common ancestor]] (LUCA) of all [[organism]]s living on Earth.&lt;ref name="NYT-20160725"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wade |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Wade |title=Meet Luca, the Ancestor of All Living Things |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/26/science/last-universal-ancestor.html |date=25 July 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth has resources that have been exploited by humans. Those termed [[non-renewable resource]]s, such as [[fossil fuel]]s, only renew over geological timescales.

Large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of [[coal]], [[petroleum]], and [[natural gas]]. These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production. Mineral [[ore]] bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of [[ore genesis]], resulting from actions of [[magmatism]], erosion, and plate tectonics.&lt;ref name="Ramdohr"/&gt; These bodies form concentrated sources for many metals and other useful [[chemical element|elements]].

Earth's biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans, including food, [[wood]], [[pharmaceutical]]s, oxygen, and the recycling of many organic wastes. The land-based [[ecosystem]] depends upon [[topsoil]] and fresh water, and the oceanic ecosystem depends upon dissolved nutrients washed down from the land.&lt;ref name=science299_5607_673/&gt; In 1980, {{convert|5053|e6ha|e6km2 e6sqmi|order=out|abbr=unit}} of Earth's land surface consisted of forest and woodlands, {{convert|6788|e6ha|e6km2 e6sqmi|order=out|abbr=unit}} was grasslands and pasture, and {{convert|1501|e6ha|e6km2 e6sqmi|order=out|abbr=unit}} was cultivated as croplands.&lt;ref name="Turner1990"/&gt; The estimated amount of [[irrigated land]] in 1993 was {{convert|2481250|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; Humans also live on the land by using [[building material]]s to construct shelters.

===Natural and environmental hazards===
[[File:Pavlof2014iss.jpg|thumb|left|A volcano injecting hot ash into the atmosphere]]
Large areas of Earth's surface are subject to extreme weather such as tropical [[cyclone]]s, [[hurricane]]s, or [[typhoon]]s that dominate life in those areas. From 1980 to 2000, these events caused an average of 11,800 human deaths per year.&lt;ref name=walsh2008/&gt; Many places are subject to earthquakes, [[landslide]]s, [[tsunami]]s, [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]], [[tornado]]es, [[sinkhole]]s, [[blizzard]]s, floods, droughts, [[wildfire]]s, and other calamities and disasters.

Many localized areas are subject to human-made [[pollution]] of the air and water, [[acid rain]] and toxic substances, loss of vegetation ([[overgrazing]], [[deforestation]], [[desertification]]), loss of wildlife, species [[extinction]], [[soil degradation]], [[soil depletion]] and [[erosion]].

There is a [[scientific consensus]] linking human activities to [[global warming]] due to industrial carbon dioxide emissions. This is predicted to produce changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, more extreme temperature ranges, significant changes in weather and a [[Sea level rise|global rise in average sea levels]].&lt;ref name=un20070202/&gt;

==Human geography==

[[Cartography]], the study and practice of map-making, and [[geography]], the study of the lands, features, inhabitants and phenomena on Earth, have historically been the disciplines devoted to depicting Earth.

{{Main|Moon}}

The Moon is a relatively large, [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial]], planet-like [[natural satellite]], with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] is larger relative to the [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]]. The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as "moons", after Earth's.

The gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes [[tide]]s on Earth. The same effect on the Moon has led to its [[tidal locking]]: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the [[lunar phase]]s; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the [[terminator (solar)|solar terminator]].
[[File:Earth-Moon.svg|thumb|left|Details of the Earth–Moon system, showing the radius of each object and the Earth–Moon [[barycenter]]. The Moon's axis is located by [[Cassini's laws|Cassini's third law]].]]

Due to their [[Tidal acceleration|tidal interaction]], the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately {{convert|38|mm/yr|in/yr|abbr=on}}. Over millions of years, these tiny modifications—and the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23&amp;nbsp;[[Microsecond|µs]]/yr—add up to significant changes.&lt;ref name=espenak_meeus20070207/&gt; During the [[Devonian]] period, for example, (approximately {{val|410|u=Mya}}) there were 400 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.8 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lambeck |first=Kurt |title=The Earth's Variable Rotation: Geophysical Causes and Consequences |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1980 |page=367 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kiG3uYkoUEC&amp;pg=PA62 |isbn=978-0-521-67330-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate. [[Paleontology|Paleontological]] evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon.&lt;ref name=aaa428_261/&gt; Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the [[torque]]s applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years, as appears to be the case for Mars.&lt;ref name=nature410_6830_773/&gt;

Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The [[angular size]] (or [[solid angle]]) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant.&lt;ref name=angular /&gt; This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.

The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the [[giant-impact hypothesis]], states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.&lt;ref name=nature412_708/&gt;

==Asteroids and artificial satellites==

The standard astronomical symbol of Earth consists of a cross [[circumscribed circle|circumscribed by a circle]], [[File:Earth symbol.svg|18px]],&lt;ref name=liungman2004/&gt; representing the [[four corners of the world]].

[[Culture|Human cultures]] have developed many views of the planet. Earth is sometimes [[Anthropomorphism|personified]] as a [[deity]]. In many cultures it is a [[mother goddess]] that is also the primary [[fertility deity]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Thematic Guide to World Mythology |last=Stookey |first=Lorena Laura |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-313-31505-3 |location=Westport, Conn. |pages=114–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the mid-20th century, the [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia Principle]] compared Earth's environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability.&lt;ref name="vanishing255"&gt;Lovelock, James.

Scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet. Initial belief in a [[flat Earth]] was gradually displaced in the Greek colonies of southern Italy during the late 6th century BC by the idea of [[spherical Earth]],&lt;ref name=russell1997/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burkert1971"&gt;{{cite book |last=Burkert |first=Walter |author-link=Walter Burkert |date=1 June 1972 |title=Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0qqp4Vk1zG0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Pythagoreanism#v=onepage&amp;q=Pythagoreanism |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-53918-1 |pages=306–308 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kahn2001"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kahn |first=Charles H. |date=2001 |title=Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans: A Brief History |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GKUtAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=Pythagoreanism#v=snippet&amp;q=Empedocles%20spherical |location=Indianapolis, Indiana and Cambridge, England |publisher=Hackett Publishing Company |isbn=978-0-87220-575-8 |page=53 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was attributed to both the philosophers [[Pythagoras]] and [[Parmenides]].&lt;ref name="Burkert1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kahn2001"/&gt; By the end of the 5th century BC, the [[sphericity]] of Earth was universally accepted among Greek intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dicks |first=D.

It was only during the 19th century that geologists realized [[Earth's age]] was at least many millions of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Physical Geology: Exploring the Earth |last=Monroe |first=James |publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-495-01148-4 |location= |pages=263–65 |last2=Wicander |first2=Reed |last3=Hazlett |first3=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] used [[thermodynamics]] to estimate the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400&amp;nbsp;million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; it was only when radioactivity and [[Radiometric dating|radioactive dating]] were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth's age was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=An Equation for Every Occasion: Fifty-Two Formulas and Why They Matter |last=Henshaw |first=John M. |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-421-41491-1 |location= |pages=117–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Lord Kelvin and the Age of the Earth |last=Burchfield |first=Joe D. |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-226-08043-7 |location= |pages=13–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perception of Earth shifted again in the 20th century when humans first viewed it from orbit, and especially with photographs of Earth returned by the [[Apollo program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://alcalde.texasexes.org/2012/06/neil-degrasse-tyson-on-why-space-matters-watch/ |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson: Why Space Matters |work=[[The Alcalde]] |first=Rose |last=Cahalan |date=5 June 2012 |accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=Aoki&gt;The ultimate source of these figures, uses the term "seconds of UT1" instead of "seconds of mean solar time".—{{cite journal |last=Aoki |first=S. |title=The new definition of universal time |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |year=1982 |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=359–61 |bibcode=1982A&amp;A...105..359A |last2=Kinoshita |first2=H. |last3=Guinot |first3=B. |last4=Kaplan |first4=G.

&lt;ref name=apsis&gt;aphelion = ''a'' × (1 + ''e''); perihelion = ''a'' × (1&amp;nbsp;– ''e''), where ''a'' is the semi-major axis and ''e'' is the eccentricity. The difference between Earth's perihelion and aphelion is 5 million kilometers.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=epoch&gt;All astronomical quantities vary, both [[Secular phenomena|secularly]] and [[Frequency|periodically]]. The quantities given are the values at the instant [[J2000.0]] of the secular variation, ignoring all periodic variations.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=hill_radius&gt;For Earth, the [[Hill radius]] is &lt;math&gt;R_H = a\left ( \frac{m}{3M} \right )^{\frac{1}{3}}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''m'' is the mass of Earth, ''a'' is an astronomical unit, and ''M'' is the mass of the Sun. So the radius in AU is about &lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{1}{3 \cdot 332,946} \right )^{\frac{1}{3}} = 0.01&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=jaes41_3_379&gt;Including the [[Somali Plate]], which is being formed out of the African Plate. See: {{cite journal |first=Jean |last=Chorowicz |date=October 2005 |title=The East African rift system |journal=[[Journal of African Earth Sciences]] |volume=43 |issue=1–3 |pages=379–410 |doi=10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2005.07.019 |bibcode=2005JAfES..43..379C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=sidereal_solar&gt;The number of solar days in a year is one less than the number of [[sidereal day]]s (the time it takes the Earth to revolve exactly 360 degrees around its axis) because a solar day is about 236 seconds longer than a sidereal day. Over a year, this discrepancy adds up to a full sidereal day.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=solar_energy&gt;Aphelion is 103.4% of the distance to perihelion. Due to the inverse square law, the radiation at perihelion is about 106.9% the energy at aphelion.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=surfacecover&gt;Due to natural fluctuations, ambiguities surrounding [[Ice shelf|ice shelves]], and mapping conventions for [[vertical datum]]s, exact values for land and ocean coverage are not meaningful. Based on data from the [[Vector Map]] and [http://www.landcover.org/ Global Landcover] datasets, extreme values for coverage of lakes and streams are 0.6% and 1.0% of Earth's surface. The ice shields of [[Antarctica]] and [[Greenland]] are counted as land, even though much of the rock that supports them lies below sea level.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=trench_depth&gt;This is the measurement taken by the vessel ''[[Kaikō]]'' in March 1995 and is considered the most accurate measurement to date. See the [[Challenger Deep]] article for more details.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=space_debris&gt;As of 4 January 2018, the United States Strategic Command tracked a total of 18,835 artificial objects, mostly debris.

Received [[radiation]] is unevenly distributed over the planet, because the Sun heats equatorial regions more than polar regions. The atmosphere and ocean work non-stop to even out solar heating imbalances through [[evaporation]] of surface water, convection, rainfall, winds, and ocean circulation. Earth is very close to being in [[radiative equilibrium]], the situation where the incoming solar energy is balanced by an equal flow of heat to space; under that condition, global temperatures will be ''relatively'' stable. Globally, over the course of the year, the Earth system—land surfaces, oceans, and atmosphere—absorbs and then radiates back to space an average of about 240 watts of solar power per square meter. Anything that increases or decreases the amount of incoming or outgoing energy will change global temperatures in response.&lt;ref name="Lindsey 2009"&gt;{{cite journal

However, Earth's energy balance and heat fluxes depend on many factors, such as atmospheric composition (mainly aerosols and greenhouse gases), the [[albedo]] (reflectivity) of surface properties, cloud cover and vegetation and land use patterns.

Changes in surface temperature due to Earth's energy budget do not occur instantaneously, due to the [[inertia]] of the [[ocean]]s and the [[cryosphere]]. The net heat flux is buffered primarily by becoming part of the [[ocean heat content|ocean's heat content]], until a new equilibrium state is established between radiative forcings and the climate response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Energy budget==
[[File:Earth_heat_balance_Sankey_diagram.svg|thumb|250px|left|A [[Sankey diagram]] illustrating the Earth's energy budget described in this section &amp;mdash; line thickness is linearly proportional to relative amount of energy.&lt;ref name="energy_budget" /&gt;]]
In spite of the enormous transfers of energy into and from the Earth, it maintains a relatively constant temperature because, as a whole, there is little net gain or loss: Earth emits via atmospheric and terrestrial radiation (shifted to longer electromagnetic wavelengths) to space about the same amount of energy as it receives via insolation (all forms of electromagnetic radiation).

To quantify Earth's ''heat budget'' or ''heat balance'', let the insolation received at the top of the atmosphere be 100 units (100 units = about 1,360 watts per square meter facing the sun), as shown in the accompanying illustration. Called the [[albedo]] of Earth, around 35 units are reflected back to space: 27 from the top of clouds, 2 from snow and ice-covered areas, and 6 by other parts of the atmosphere. The 65 remaining units are absorbed: 14 within the atmosphere and 51 by the Earth’s surface. These 51 units are radiated to space in the form of terrestrial radiation: 17 directly radiated to space and 34 absorbed by the atmosphere (19 through latent heat of condensation, 9 via convection and turbulence, and 6 directly absorbed). The 48 units absorbed by the atmosphere (34 units from terrestrial radiation and 14 from insolation) are finally radiated back to space. These 65 units (17 from the ground and 48 from the atmosphere) balance the 65 units absorbed from the sun in order to maintain zero net gain of energy by the Earth.&lt;ref name="energy_budget"&gt;

===Incoming radiant energy (shortwave)===

The total amount of energy received per second at the top of [[Earth's atmosphere]] (TOA) is measured in [[watt]]s and is given by the [[solar constant]] times the cross-sectional area of the Earth. Because the surface area of a sphere is four times the cross-sectional surface area of a sphere (i.e. the area of a circle), the average TOA flux is one quarter of the solar constant and so is approximately 340&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Earth's radiation balance and its representation in CMIP5 models|publisher=Copernicus|year=2013|author1=Wild, Martin |author2=Folini, Doris |author3=Schär, Christoph |author4=Loeb, Norman |author5=Dutton, Ellsworth |author6=König-Langlo, Gert |bibcode=2013EGUGA..15.1286W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the absorption varies with location as well as with diurnal, seasonal and annual variations, the numbers quoted are long-term averages, typically averaged from multiple satellite measurements.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;

Of the ~340&amp;nbsp;W/m² of solar radiation received by the Earth, an average of ~77&amp;nbsp;W/m² is reflected back to space by clouds and the atmosphere and ~23&amp;nbsp;W/m² is reflected by the surface [[albedo]], leaving ~240&amp;nbsp;W/m² of solar energy input to the Earth's energy budget. This gives the earth a mean net albedo of 0.29.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;

===Earth's internal heat and other small effects===
The [[Earth's internal heat budget|geothermal heat flux]] from the Earth's interior is estimated to be 47 [[terawatt]]s.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;Davies, J. H., &amp; Davies, D. R. (2010). Earth's surface heat flux. Solid Earth, 1(1), 5–24.&lt;/ref&gt; This comes to 0.087&amp;nbsp;watt/square metre, which represents only 0.027% of Earth's total energy budget at the surface, which is dominated by 173,000 terawatts of incoming [[solar radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ISBN=978-0-470-94341-0|author=Archer, D.|year=2012|title=Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World energy consumption|Human production of energy]] is even lower, at an estimated 18 TW.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[Photosynthesis]] has a larger effect: [[photosynthetic efficiency]] turns up to 2% of incoming sunlight into [[primary production|biomass]], for a total photosynthetic productivity of earth between ~1500–2250 TW (~1%+/-0.26% solar energy hitting the Earth's surface).&lt;ref name="PLoS"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pisciotta JM, Zou Y, Baskakov IV |title=Light-Dependent Electrogenic Activity of Cyanobacteria |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=e10821 |year=2010 |pmid=20520829 |pmc=2876029 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010821|bibcode=2010PLoSO...510821P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other minor sources of energy are usually ignored in these calculations, including accretion of [[interplanetary dust]] and [[solar wind]], light from stars other than the Sun and the thermal radiation from space. Earlier, [[Joseph Fourier]] had claimed that deep space radiation was significant in a paper often cited as the first on the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William M. Connolley's page about Fourier 1827: MEMOIRE sur les temperatures du globe terrestre et des espaces planetaires|url=http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/fourier_1827/|last=Connolley|first=William M.|authorlink=William Connolley|publisher=William M. Connolley|date=18 May 2003|accessdate=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longwave radiation===
{{main|Outgoing longwave radiation}}
Longwave radiation is usually defined as outgoing [[infrared]] energy leaving the planet. However, the atmosphere absorbs parts initially, or cloud cover can reflect radiation. Generally, heat energy is transported between the planet's surface layers (land and ocean) to the atmosphere, transported via [[evapotranspiration]] and [[latent heat]] fluxes or [[thermal conduction|conduction]]/[[convection]] processes.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;  Ultimately, energy is radiated in the form of longwave [[Infrared#Earth as an infrared emitter|infrared radiation]] back into space.

Recent satellite observations indicate additional precipitation, which is sustained by increased energy leaving the surface through evaporation (the latent heat flux), offsetting increases in longwave flux to the surface.&lt;ref name=SatObsEva /&gt;

==Earth's energy imbalance==
If the incoming energy flux is not equal to the outgoing energy flux, net heat is added to or lost by the planet (if the incoming flux is larger or smaller than the outgoing respectively).

===Indirect measurement===
An imbalance must show in something on Earth warming or cooling (depending on the direction of the imbalance), and the ocean being the larger [[thermal reservoir]] on Earth, is a prime candidate for measurements.

Earth's energy imbalance measurements provided by [[Argo (oceanography)|Argo floats]] have detected an accumulation of [[ocean heat content]] (OHC). The estimated imbalance was measured during a deep [[solar minimum]] of 2005–2010 to be 0.58 ± 0.15&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref name="Imbalance"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=James Hansen |author2=Makiko Sato |author3=Pushker Kharecha |author4=Karina von Schuckmann |publisher=NASA|date=January 2012|url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_16/|title=Earth's Energy Imbalance}}&lt;/ref&gt; This level of detail cannot be inferred directly from measurements of surface energy fluxes, which have combined uncertainties of the order of ± 17&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An update on Earth's energy balance in light of the latest global observations|url = http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v5/n10/full/ngeo1580.html|journal = Nature Geoscience|date = 2012-10-01|issn = 1752-0894|pages = 691–696|volume = 5|issue = 10|doi = 10.1038/ngeo1580|first = Graeme L.|last = Stephens|first2 = Juilin|last2 = Li|first3 = Martin|last3 = Wild|first4 = Carol Anne|last4 = Clayson|first5 = Norman|last5 = Loeb|first6 = Seiji|last6 = Kato|first7 = Tristan|last7 = L'Ecuyer|first8 = Paul W. |last8 = Stackhouse Jr.|first9 = Matthew|last9 = Lebsock|bibcode = 2012NatGe...5..691S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Direct measurement ===
Several [[satellite]]s indirectly measure the energy absorbed and radiated by Earth and by inference the energy imbalance. The [[NASA]] [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite|Earth Radiation Budget Experiment]] (ERBE) project involves three such satellites: the [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite]] (ERBS), launched October 1984; NOAA-9, launched December 1984; and NOAA-10, launched September 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icp.giss.nasa.gov/education/radforce/ Effect of the Sun's Energy on the Ocean and Atmosphere (1997)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today NASA's satellite instruments, provided by CERES, part of the NASA's [[Earth Observing System]] (EOS), are designed to measure both solar-reflected and Earth-emitted radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= B.A. Wielicki |display-authors=etal |title=Mission to Planet Earth: Role of Clouds and Radiation in Climate |journal=Bull.

==Natural greenhouse effect==

{{See also|Greenhouse effect}}
The major [[atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric]] gases ([[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]]) are transparent to incoming sunlight but are also transparent to outgoing thermal ([[infrared]]) radiation. However, [[water vapor#Water vapor in Earth.27s atmosphere|water vapor]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and other trace gases are opaque to many [[wavelength]]s of thermal radiation. The Earth's surface radiates the net equivalent of 17 percent of the incoming [[solar radiation|solar energy]] in the form of thermal infrared. However, the amount that directly escapes to space is only about 12 percent of incoming solar energy. The remaining fraction, 5 to 6 percent, is absorbed by the atmosphere by [[greenhouse gas]] [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"&gt;Edited quote from public-domain source: {{citation

[[File:CO2 H2O absorption atmospheric gases unique pattern energy wavelengths of energy transparent to others.png|500px|thumb|Atmospheric gases only absorb some wavelengths of energy but are transparent to others. The absorption patterns of water vapor (blue peaks) and carbon dioxide (pink peaks) overlap in some wavelengths. Carbon dioxide is not as strong a greenhouse gas as water vapor, but it absorbs energy in wavelengths (12–15 micrometres) that water vapor does not, partially closing the "window" through which heat radiated by the surface would normally escape to space. (Illustration NASA, Robert Rohde)&lt;ref name="NASA climate forcings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/EnergyBalance/page7.php|title=NASA: Climate Forcings and Global Warming|date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
When greenhouse gas molecules absorb thermal infrared energy, their temperature rises. Those gases then radiate an increased amount of thermal infrared energy in all directions. Heat radiated upward continues to encounter greenhouse gas molecules; those molecules also absorb the heat, and their temperature rises and the amount of heat they radiate increases. The atmosphere thins with [[altitude]], and at roughly 5–6&amp;nbsp;[[kilometre]]s, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the overlying atmosphere is so thin that heat can escape to space.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"/&gt;

Because greenhouse gas molecules radiate infrared energy in all directions, some of it spreads downward and ultimately returns to the Earth's surface, where it is absorbed. The Earth's surface temperature is thus higher than it would be if it were heated only by direct solar heating. This supplemental heating is the natural greenhouse effect.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"/&gt; It is as if the Earth is covered by a blanket that allows high frequency radiation (sunlight) to enter, but slows the rate at which the low frequency infrared radiant energy emitted by the Earth leaves.

==Climate sensitivity==
{{Main|Radiative forcing}}
A change in the incident radiated portion of the energy budget is referred to as a [[radiative forcing]].

[[Climate sensitivity]] is the [[steady state]] change in the equilibrium temperature as a result of changes in the energy budget.

===Climate forcings and global warming===
[[File:NASA Hansen Aerosol effect on expected energy imbalance Earth budget.gif|right|300px|thumb|Expected Earth energy imbalance for three choices of aerosol climate forcing. Measured imbalance, close to 0.6 W/m², implies that aerosol forcing is close to −1.6 W/m². (Credit: NASA/GISS)&lt;ref name="Imbalance" /&gt;]]
Climate forcings are changes that cause temperatures to rise or fall, disrupting the energy balance. Natural climate forcings include changes in the Sun's brightness, [[Milankovitch cycles]] (small variations in the shape of Earth's orbit and its axis of rotation that occur over thousands of years) and volcanic eruptions that inject light-reflecting particles as high as the [[stratosphere]]. Man-made forcings include particle pollution ([[aerosols]]) that absorb and reflect incoming sunlight; [[deforestation]], which changes how the surface reflects and absorbs sunlight; and the rising concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which decreases the rate at which heat is radiated to space.

A forcing can trigger [[feedback]]s that intensify ([[positive feedback]]) or weaken ([[negative feedback]]) the original forcing. For example, [[Arctic sea ice decline|loss of ice]] at the poles, which makes them less reflective, causes greater absorption of energy and so increases the rate at which the ice melts, is an example of a positive feedback.&lt;ref name="NASA climate forcings" /&gt;

The observed planetary energy imbalance during the [[solar cycle 24|recent solar minimum]] shows that solar forcing of climate, although natural and significant, is overwhelmed by anthropogenic climate forcing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_16/|title=NASA GISS: Science Brief: Earth's Energy Imbalance|website=www.giss.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[NASA]] scientists reported that to stop [[global warming]] atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content would have to be reduced to 350&amp;nbsp;ppm or less, assuming all other climate forcings were fixed. The impact of anthropogenic [[aerosols]] has not been quantified, but individual aerosol types are thought to have substantial heating and cooling effects.&lt;ref name="Imbalance" /&gt;

Emergy is an expression of all the energy used in the work processes that generate a product or service in units of one type of energy. Emergy is measured in units of ''emjoule''s, a unit referring to the available energy consumed in transformations. Emergy accounts for different forms of energy and resources (e.g. sunlight, water, fossil fuels, minerals, etc.) Each form is generated by transformation processes in nature and each has a different ability to support work in natural and in human systems. The recognition of these quality differences is a key concept.

==History==

The theoretical and conceptual basis for the emergy methodology is grounded in [[thermodynamics]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, [[System theory|general system theory]]&lt;ref&gt;von Bertalanffy. L. 1968. [[System theory|General System Theory]]. George Braziller Publ. New York 295 p.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[systems ecology]].&lt;ref name=SysEco&gt;Odum, H. T. 1983.

Odum]] over the first thirty years is reviewed in ''Environmental Accounting''&lt;ref name =EnvAcct/&gt; and in the volume edited by C. A. S. Hall titled ''Maximum Power''.&lt;ref name=SelfOrg&gt;Odum, H.T., 1995. Self organization and maximum power. Chapter 28, pp. 311-364 in ''Maximum Power'', Ed. by C .A. S. Hall, University Press of Colorado, Niwot.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===

Beginning in the 1950s, Odum analyzed [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flow]] in ecosystems (''e.g.'' [[Silver Springs, Florida]];&lt;ref name=SilverSprings&gt;Odum, H. T. 1957.  Trophic structure and productivity of Silver Springs, Florida.  ''Ecol. Monogr''. 27:55-112.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enewetak Atoll|Enewetak atoll]] in the south Pacific;&lt;ref name=Eniwetok&gt;Odum, H. T. and E. P. Odum. 1955.  Trophic structure and productivity of a windward coral reef at Eniwetok Atoll, Marshall Islands.  ''Ecol. Monogr.'' 25:291-320.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galveston Bay]], Texas&lt;ref name=Texas&gt;Odum, H. T. and C. M. Hoskin. 1958.  Comparative studies of the metabolism of Texas Bays.  ''Pubi. Inst. Mar. Sci.'', Univ. Tex. 5:16-46.&lt;/ref&gt; and Puerto Rican rainforests,&lt;ref name=PR&gt;Odum, H. T. and R. F. Pigeon, eds. 1970.  ''A Tropical Rain Forest''.  Division of Technical Information, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. 1600 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; amongst others) where energies in various forms at various scales were observed. His analysis of energy flow in ecosystems, and the differences in the [[potential energy]] of sunlight, fresh water currents, wind and [[ocean current]]s led him to make the suggestion that when two or more different energy sources drive a system, they cannot be added without first converting them to a common measure that accounts for their differences in energy quality. This led him to introduce the concept of "energy of one kind" as a common denominator with the name "energy cost".&lt;ref name=FoodProd&gt;Odum, H. T. 1967.  Energetics of food production.  In: The ''World Food Problem, Report of the President's Science Advisory Committee, Panel on World Food Supply, Vol. 3''. The Whitehouse. pp. 55-94.&lt;/ref&gt; He then expanded the analysis to model food production in the 1960s,&lt;ref name=FoodProd /&gt; and in the 1970s to [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref name= Congress&gt;Odum, H. T. ''et al.'' 1976.  Net Energy Analysis of Alternatives for the United States.  In ''U.S. Energy Policy: Trends and Goals'',  Part V – Middle and Long-term Energy Policies and Alternatives. 94th Congress 2nd Session Committee Print.  Prepared for the Subcommittee on Energy and Power of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the U.S. House of Representatives, 66-723, U.S. Govt.  Printing Office, Wash, DC. pp. 254–304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Man&amp;Nature&gt;Odum, H. T. and E. C. Odum. 1976.  ''Energy Basis for Man and Nature''. McGraw-Hill, NY. 297 pp&lt;/ref&gt;

Odum's first formal statement of what would later be termed emergy was in 1973:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Energy is measured by calories, [[btu]]'s, kilowatthours, and other intraconvertable units, but energy has a scale of quality which is not indicated by these measures.  The ability to do work for man depends on the energy quality and quantity and this is measurable by the amount of energy of a lower quality grade required to develop the higher grade. The scale of energy goes from dilute sunlight up to plant matter, to coal, from coal to oil, to electricity and up to the high quality efforts of computer and human [[information processing]].&lt;ref name=AMBIO&gt;Odum, H. T. 1973.  ''Energy, ecology and economics''.  Royal Swedish Academy of Science.  AMBIO 2(6):220-227.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1975, he introduced a table of "Energy Quality Factors", kilocalories of sunlight energy required to make a kilocalorie of a higher quality energy,&lt;ref name=NRGQuality&gt;Odum, H. T. 1976.  'Energy quality and carrying capacity of the earth.  Response at Prize Ceremony, Institute de la Vie, Paris.  ''Tropical Ecology'' 16(l):1–8.&lt;/ref&gt; the first mention of the energy hierarchy principle which states that "energy quality is measured by the energy used in the transformations" from one type of energy to the next.

These energy quality factors, were placed on a fossil-fuel basis and called "Fossil Fuel Work Equivalents" (FFWE), and the quality of energies were measured based on a fossil fuel standard with rough equivalents of 1 kilocalorie of fossil fuel equal to 2000 kilocalories of sunlight. "Energy quality ratios" were computed by evaluating the quantity of energy in a transformation process to make a new form and were then used to convert different forms of energy to a common form, in this case fossil fuel equivalents. FFWE's were replaced with coal equivalents (CE) and by 1977, the system of evaluating quality was placed on a solar basis and termed solar equivalents (SE).&lt;ref name=NRGAnalysis&gt;Odum, H. T. 1977.  Energy analysis, energy quality and environment.  In ''Energy Analysis: A New Public Policy Tool'', M. W. Gilliland, ed.  American Association for the Advancement of Science, Selected Symposium No. 9, Wash. DC. Westview Press. pp. 55–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embodied energy===

The term "[[embodied energy]]" was used for a time in the early 1980s to refer to energy quality differences in terms of their costs of generation, and a ratio called a "quality factor" for the calories (or joules) of one kind of energy required to make those of another.&lt;ref name=EnvEdu&gt;Odum, E. C., and Odum, H. T., 1980. Energy systems and environmental education. Pp. 213–231 in: ''Environmental Education- Principles, Methods and Applications'', Ed. by T. S. Bakshi and Z. Naveh. Plenum Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the term embodied energy was used by other groups who were evaluating the fossil fuel energy required to generate products and were not including all energies or using the concept to imply quality, embodied energy was dropped in favor of "embodied solar calories", and the quality factors became known as "transformation ratios".

===Introduction of the term "emergy"===

Use of the term "embodied energy" for this concept was modified in 1986 when [[David M. Scienceman|David Scienceman]], a visiting scholar at the University of Florida from Australia, suggested the term "emergy" and "emjoule" or "emcalorie" as the unit of measure to distinguish emergy units from units of available energy.&lt;ref&gt;Scienceman, D. M., 1987. "Energy and Emergy," in G. Pillet and T. Murota (eds), ''Environmental Economics: The Analysis of a Major Interface,'' R. Leimgruber, Geneva, pp. 257–276. (CFW-86-26)&lt;/ref&gt; The term transformation ratio was shortened to [[transformity]] in about the same time. It is important to note that throughout this twenty years the baseline or the basis for evaluating forms of energy and resources shifted from organic matter, to fossil fuels and finally to solar energy.

After 1986, the emergy methodology continued to develop as the community of scientists expanded and as new applied research into combined systems of humans and nature presented new conceptual and theoretical questions. The maturing of the emergy methodology resulted in more rigorous definitions of terms and nomenclature and refinement of the methods of calculating transformities. The [http://EmergySociety.org International Society for the Advancement of Emergy Research] and a biennial [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611231212/http://www.cep.ees.ufl.edu/conference.asp International Conference] at the University of Florida support this research.

==Definitions and examples==

'''''Emergy'''''— amount of energy of one form that is used in transformations directly and indirectly to make a product or service. The unit of emergy is the '''emjoule''' or emergy joule. Using emergy, sunlight, fuel, electricity, and human service can be put on a common basis by expressing each of them in the emjoules of solar energy that is required to produce them. If solar emergy is the baseline, then the results are solar emjoules (abbreviated seJ). Although other baselines have been used, such as coal emjoules or electrical emjoules, in most cases emergy data are given in solar emjoules.

'''''Unit Emergy Values (UEVs)''''' — the emergy required to generate one unit of output. Types of UEVs:
:'''''Transformity''''' — emergy input per unit of available energy output. For example, if 10,000 solar emjoules are required to generate a joule of wood, then the solar transformity of that wood is 10,000 solar emjoules per joule (abbreviated seJ/J). The solar transformity of the sunlight absorbed by the earth is 1.0 by definition.

:'''''Specific emergy''''' — emergy per unit mass output. Specific emergy is usually expressed as solar emergy per gram (seJ/g). Because energy is required to concentrate materials, the unit emergy value of any substance increases with concentration. Elements and compounds not abundant in nature therefore have higher emergy/mass ratios when found in concentrated form since more environmental work is required to concentrate them, both spatially and chemically.

:'''''Emergy per unit money''''' — the emergy supporting the generation of one unit of economic product (expressed in monetary terms)''.'' It is used to convert money into emergy units. Since money is paid for goods and services, but not to the environment, the contribution to a process represented by monetary payments is the emergy that money purchases. The amount of resources that money buys depends on the amount of emergy supporting the economy and the amount of money circulating. An average emergy/money ratio in solar emjoules/$ can be calculated by dividing the total emergy use of a state or nation by its gross economic product. It varies by country and has been shown to decrease each year, which is one index of inflation. This emergy/money ratio is useful for evaluating service inputs given in money units where an average wage rate is appropriate.

:'''''Emergy per unit labor''''' — the emergy supporting one unit of direct labor applied to a process''.'' Workers apply their efforts to a process and in so doing they indirectly invest in it the emergy that made their labor possible (food, training, transport, etc). This emergy intensity is generally expressed as emergy per time (seJ/yr; seJ/hr), but emergy per money earned (seJ/$) is also used. Indirect labor required to make and supply the inputs to a process is generally measured with the dollar cost of services, so that its emergy intensity is calculated as seJ/$.

:'''''Empower''''' — a flow of emergy (i.e., emergy per unit time)''.''

==Accounting method==

Emergy accounting converts the thermodynamic basis of all forms of energy, resources and human services into equivalents of a single form of energy, usually solar. To evaluate a system, a system diagram organizes the evaluation and account for energy inputs and outflows. A table of the flows of resources, labor and energy is constructed from the diagram and all flows are evaluated. The final step involves interpreting the results.&lt;ref name=EnvAcct /&gt;

===Purpose===

In some cases, an evaluation is done to determine the fit of a development proposal within its environment. It also allows comparison of alternatives. Another purpose is to seek the best use of resources to maximize economic vitality.

===Systems diagram===

[[File:Systems diagram of a city.png|thumb|alt=A systems diagram of a city embedded in its support region showing the environmental energy and non renewable energy sources that drive the region and city system|'''Figure 1''': Energy system diagram of a city in its support region]]
System diagrams show the inputs that are evaluated and summed to obtain the emergy of a flow. A diagram of a city and its regional support area is shown in Figure 1.&lt;ref&gt;Many example diagrams can be found at [http://emergysystems.org/symbols.php EmergySystems.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309041649/http://www.emergysystems.org/symbols.php |date=2010-03-09 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluation table===

A table (see example below) of resource flows, labor and energy is constructed from the diagram. Raw data on inflows that cross the boundary are converted into emergy units, and then summed to obtain total emergy supporting the system. Energy flows per unit time (usually per year) are presented in the table as separate line items.

* Column #1 is the line item number, which is also the number of the footnote found below the table where raw data sources are cited and calculations are shown.
*Column # 2 is the name of the item, which is also shown on the aggregated diagram.
*Column # 3 is the raw data in joules, grams, dollars or other units.
*Column # 4 shows the units for each raw data item.
*Column # 5 is the unit emergy value, expressed in solar emergy joules per unit. Sometimes, inputs are expressed in grams, hours, or dollars, therefore an appropriate UEV is used (sej/hr; sej/g; sej/$).
*Column # 6 is the solar emergy of a given flow, calculated as the raw input times the UEV (Column 3 times Column 5).

All tables are followed by footnotes that show citations for data and calculations.

===Calculating unit values===

The table allows a unit emergy value to be calculated. The final, output row (row “O” in the example table above) is evaluated first in units of energy or mass. Then the input emergy is summed and the unit emergy value is calculated by dividing the emergy by the units of the output.

===Performance indicators===

[[File:EmergyRatios5.png|thumb|alt=a basic diagram showing an economic progress that draws resources from the environment that are both renewable and non renewable energies and feedbacks from the main economy.|'''Figure 2''': Systems diagram showing flows used in the performance indicator ratios]]
Figure 2 shows non-renewable environmental contributions (N) as an emergy storage of materials, renewable environmental inputs (R), and inputs from the economy as purchased (F) goods and services. Purchased inputs are needed for the process to take place and include human service and purchased non-renewable energy and material brought in from elsewhere (fuels, minerals, electricity, machinery, fertilizer, etc.). Several ratios, or indices are given in Figure 2 that assess the global performance of a process.
* '''Emergy Yield Ratio (EYR) —''' Emergy released (used up) per unit invested. The ratio is a measure of how much an investment enables a process to exploit local resources.
* '''Environmental Loading Ratio (ELR''') — The ratio of nonrenewable and imported emergy use to renewable emergy use. It is an indicator of the pressure a transformation process exerts on the environment and can be considered a measure of [[ecosystem]] stress due to a production (transformation activity.
* '''Emergy Sustainability Index (ESI''') — The ratio of EYR to ELR. It measures the contribution of a resource or process to the economy per unit of environmental loading.
* '''Areal Empower Intensity —''' The ratio of emergy use in the economy of a region to its area. Renewable and nonrenewable emergy density are calculated separately by dividing the total renewable emergy by area and the total nonrenewable emergy by area, respectively.

Other ratios are useful depending on the type and scale of the system under evaluation.
* '''Percent Renewable Emergy (%Ren''') — The ratio of renewable emergy to total emergy use. In the long run, only processes with high %Ren are sustainable.
* '''Emprice'''. The emprice of a commodity is the emergy one receives for the money spent in sej/$.
* '''Emergy Exchange Ratio (EER''') — The ratio of emergy exchanged in a trade or purchase (what is received to what is given). The ratio is always expressed relative to a trading partner and is a measure of the relative trade advantage of one partner over the other.
* '''Emergy per capita —''' The ratio of emergy use of a region or nation to the population. Emergy per capita can be used as a measure of potential, average standard of living of the population.
* '''Emergy-based energy return on investment''' was introduced as a way to bridge and improve the concept of [[Energy returned on energy invested]] to also include environmental impacts.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Y.|last2=Feng|first2=L.|last3=Wang|first3=J.|last4=Höök|first4=M|title=Emergy-based energy return on investment method for evaluating energy exploitation|journal=Energy|date=2017|volume=128|issue=6|pages=540–549|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2017.04.058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

The recognition of the relevance of energy to the growth and dynamics of [[complex systems]] has resulted in increased emphasis on  environmental evaluation methods that can account for and interpret the effects of matter and energy flows at all scales in systems of humanity and nature. The following table lists some general areas in which the emergy methodology has been employed.

Net-Energy Analysis and the Energy Requirements of Energy Systems. Praeger Publishers, New York, 289 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Emergy theory has been criticized for allegedly offering an energy theory of value to replace other [[Labor theory of value|theories of value]].{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} The stated goal of emergy evaluations is to provide an "ecocentric" valuation of systems, processes. Thus it does not purport to replace economic values but to provide additional information, from a different point of view.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The idea that a [[calorie]] of sunlight is not equivalent to a calorie of fossil fuel or electricity strikes many as absurd, based on the [[Newton's laws of motion|1st Law]] definition of energy units as measures of heat (i.e. Joule's [[mechanical equivalent of heat]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sciubba, E., 2010. On the Second-Law inconsistency of Emergy Analysis. Energy 35, 3696-3706.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have rejected the concept as impractical since from their perspective it is impossible to objectively quantify the amount of sunlight that is required to produce a quantity of oil. In combining systems of humanity and nature and evaluating environmental input to economies, mainstream economists criticize the emergy methodology for disregarding market values.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3864">'''Energoland''' is an information centre for energy and electricity generation which was opened by [[Slovenské elektrárne]] on 14 October 2014 at [[Mochovce]], [[Slovakia]], at the site of the nuclear power plant. It is situated between Levice and Nitra. The centre mainly serves the schools and public. The entry is free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;http://energoland.seas.sk/reservations&lt;/ref&gt; The exposition was awarded as an excellent communication project at the PIME conference and evaluated as a five-star training centre by Laura Elizabeth Kennedy, governor of the United States of America in the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna and chargé d'affaires of permanent representation of the USA in international organisation in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/iaea-governor-energoland-is-a-5-star-education-centre/156&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exposition ==
In Energoland, there are more than thirty objects, applications, and interactive expositions. Edutainment (blending education and entertainment) at Mochovce offers information on energy, electricity generation, global warming, and carbon burden. In addition, visitors learn about the energy mix, electricity grid dispatching, or about the radiation around us. The exposition also focuses on power industry, not only with respect to safety and radioactive waste but also dealing with the fuel cycle, nanowolrd of atoms, and Cherenkov radiation. Some of the specialities include the 3D cinema with its own movie Energy Odyssey, a model of emission-free motorcycle, interactive LED floor or thermal mirror, and mobile application using augmented reality, "Energoland",&lt;ref&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.sk.strategic.EnergolandAR&lt;/ref&gt; downloadable from Google Play or AppStore. Through the Energy Map, various facts and statistics can be searched which are directly shown in the map of the world with the highlighted countries.
Energoland also wants its visitors to make their own opinion of the electricity generation and its sources. Therefore, it does not provide information only about nuclear energy but it also brings knowledge about other sources: water, sun, wind, geothermal energy, or fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;http://energoland.seas.sk/exposition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/energoland-opened-by-slovenske-elektrarne/119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/gallery/energoland-new-dimension-of-entertainment&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction of Energoland ==
The design of the building is the work of Ing. arch. Viktor Šabík (BARAK Architekti) who, together with the QEX Company and Italian agency Piter Design, designed the interior of Energoland, as well.[2] The total area of the building, including the training rooms and offices is 2,000 square metres; the info centre itself takes up the area of 600 m2.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/data/education/126/file/cfakepathe-atom-10-14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Activities ==
Energoland is not only a visitor and information centre; it also serves as a training centre for the employees of Slovenské elektrárne and provides office areas. There are many events for the employees of Slovenské elektrárne or public taking place here, such as the 90 reactor-years anniversary,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/90-reaktorrokov-jadrovych-blokov-slovenskych-elektrarni/140&lt;/ref&gt; programme within the national round of Olympics in Physics,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/mladi-fyzici-na-olympiade-v-atomovej-elektrarni/162&lt;/ref&gt; Science Talks during the Science and Technology Week,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/slovenske-elektrarne-hlavnym-partnerom-tvt/130&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable Development Conference in May 2015, etc.

In [[ecology]], '''energy flow''', also called the '''calorific flow''', refers to the flow of [[energy]] through a [[food chain]], and is the focus of study in '''ecological energetics'''. In an [[ecosystem]], [[ecologist]]s seek to [[Quantification (science)|quantify]] the relative importance of different component [[species]] and feeding relationships.

A general energy flow scenario follows:
*[[Solar energy]] is fixed by the [[photoautotroph]]s, called primary producers, like green [[plant]]s. [[Primary consumers]] absorb most of the stored energy in the plant through [[digestion]], and transform it into the form of energy they need, such as [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), through [[cellular respiration|respiration]]. A part of the energy received by primary consumers, [[herbivore]]s, is converted to [[thermoregulation|body heat]] (an effect of respiration), which is [[radiant energy|radiated]] away and lost from the system. The loss of energy through body heat is far greater in [[warm-blooded]] animals, which must eat much more frequently than those that are [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]]. Energy loss also occurs in the expulsion of [[digestion|undigested]] food (egesta) by [[excrement|excretion]] or [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]].
*Secondary consumers, [[carnivore]]s, then consume the primary consumers, although [[omnivore]]s also consume primary producers. Energy that had been used by the primary consumers for growth and storage is thus absorbed into the secondary consumers through the process of digestion. As with primary consumers, secondary consumers convert this energy into a more suitable form (ATP) during respiration. Again, some energy is lost from the system, since energy which the primary consumers had used for respiration and regulation of body temperature cannot be utilized by the secondary consumers.
*Tertiary consumers, which may or may not be [[apex predator]]s, then consume the secondary consumers, with some energy passed on and some lost, as with the lower levels of the food chain.
*A final link in the food chain are [[decomposer]]s which break down the [[organic matter]] of the tertiary consumers (or whichever consumer is at the top of the chain) and release [[nutrient]]s into the [[soil]]. They also break down plants, herbivores and carnivores that were not eaten by organisms higher on the food chain, as well as the undigested food that is excreted by herbivores and carnivores. [[Saprotrophic nutrition|Saprotrophic]] [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] are decomposers, and play a pivotal role in the [[nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]] and [[carbon cycle]]s.

The energy is passed on from [[trophic level]] to trophic level and each time about 90% of the energy is lost, with some being lost as heat into the environment (an effect of [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]) and some being lost as incompletely digested food (egesta). Therefore, primary consumers get about 10% of the energy produced by autotrophs, while secondary consumers get 1% and tertiary consumers get 0.1%. This means the top consumer of a [[food chain]] receives the least energy, as a lot of the food chain's energy has been lost between trophic levels. This loss of energy at each level limits typical food chains to only four to six links.

== History of ecological energetics ==
Ecological energetics appears to have grown out of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the concerns of the [[Physiocrats]]. It began in the works of [[Sergei Podolinsky]] in the late 1800s, and subsequently was developed by the Soviet ecologist [[Vladmir Stanchinsky]], the Austro-American [[Alfred J. Lotka]], and American limnologists, [[Raymond Lindeman]] and [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]]. It underwent substantial development by [[Howard T. Odum]] and was applied by [[systems ecology|systems ecologists]], and [[radiation ecology|radiation ecologists]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7673">'''Energy Management Software''' ('''EMS''') is a general term and category referring to a variety of energy-related software &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mahmud|first1=Khizir|last2=Town|first2=Graham E.|title=A review of computer tools for modeling electric vehicle energy requirements and their impact on power distribution networks|journal=Applied Energy|date=June 2016|volume=172|pages=337–359|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.100}}&lt;/ref&gt; applications which may provide utility bill tracking, real-time metering, building HVAC and lighting control systems, building simulation and modeling, carbon and sustainability reporting, IT equipment management, [[demand response]], and/or energy audits. Managing energy can require a system of systems approach.&lt;ref&gt;Curry, Edward. 2012. [http://www.edwardcurry.org/publications/Curry_LinkedDataspaceForSOS_SOSE.pdf “System of Systems Information Interoperability Using a Linked Dataspace.”] In IEEE 7th International Conference on System of Systems Engineering (SOSE 2012), 101–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy management software often provides tools for reducing energy costs and consumption for buildings or communities. EMS collects energy data and uses it for three main purposes: Reporting, Monitoring and Engagement. Reporting may include verification of energy data, benchmarking, and setting high-level energy use reduction targets. Monitoring may include trend analysis and tracking [[energy consumption]] to identify cost-saving opportunities. Engagement can mean real-time responses (automated or manual), or the initiation of a dialogue between occupants and building managers to promote [[energy conservation]]. One engagement method that has recently gained popularity is the real-time energy consumption display available in web applications or an onsite energy dashboard/display.

==Data collection==
Energy Management Software collects historic and/or [[real-time data|real-time]] [[interval data]], with intervals varying from quarterly billing statements to minute-by-minute [[smart meter]] readings. The data are collected from interval meters, [[Building automation|Building Automation Systems (BAS)]], directly from utilities, directly from sensors on electrical circuits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SiteSage EMS architecture|url=https://powerhousedynamics.com/solutions/sitesage/#architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other sources. Past bills can be used to provide a comparison between pre- and post-EMS energy consumption.

Electricity and Natural Gas are the most common utilities measured, though systems may monitor steam, petroleum or other energy uses, water use, and even locally generated energy. Renewable energy sources have contributed to the spurred growth in EMS data collection markets.

==Reporting==
Reporting tools are targeted at owners and executives who want to automate energy and emissions auditing. Cost and consumption data from a number of buildings can be aggregated or compared with the software, saving time relative to manual reporting. EMS offers more detailed energy information than utility billing can provide; another advantage is that outside factors affecting energy use, such as weather or building occupancy, can be accounted for as part of the reporting process. This information can be used to prioritize energy savings initiatives and balance energy savings against energy-related capital expenditures.

Bill verification can be used to compare metered consumption against billed consumption. Bill analysis can also demonstrate the impact of different energy costs, for example by comparing electrical demand charges to consumption costs.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting can calculate direct or indirect [[Greenhouse gas emissions|GHG emissions]], which may be used for internal reporting or [[enterprise carbon accounting]].

==Monitoring==
Monitoring tools track and display real-time and historical data. Often, EMS includes various benchmarking tools, such as energy consumption per square foot, weather normalization or more advanced analysis using energy modeling algorithms to identify anomalous consumption. Seeing exactly when energy is used, combined with anomaly recognition, can allow Facility or Energy Managers to identify savings opportunities.

Initiatives such as demand shaving, replacement of malfunctioning equipment, retrofits of inefficient equipment, and removal of unnecessary loads can be discovered and coordinated using the EMS. For example, an unexpected energy spike at a specific time each day may indicate an improperly set or malfunctioning timer. These tools can also be used for Energy Monitoring and Targeting. EMS uses models to correct for variable factors such as weather when performing historical comparisons to verify the effect of conservation and efficiency initiatives.

EMS may offer alerts, via text or email messages, when consumption values exceed pre-defined thresholds based on consumption or cost. These thresholds may be set at absolute levels, or use an energy model to determine when consumption is abnormally high or low. More recently, smartphones and tablets are becoming mainstream platforms for EMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serious Energy Management Software uses Smartphones |url=http://www.seriousenergy.com/energy-management/software/sem.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619012549/http://www.seriousenergy.com:80/energy-management/software/sem.html |archivedate=2011-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Powerhouse Dynamics’ mobile app expands real-time facility ops and energy management capabilities|url=http://www.chainstoreage.com/article/powerhouse-dynamics-mobile-app-expands-real-time-facility-ops-and-energy-management-capabil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engagement==
Engagement can refer to automated or manual responses to collected and analyzed energy data. Building control systems can respond as readily to energy fluctuation as a heating system can respond to temperature variation. Demand spikes can trigger equipment power-down processes, with or without human intervention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echome.co.uk/renewable-energy-services/heating-and-lighting-controls/ "Building Automation and Control"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another objective of Engagement is to connect occupants’ daily choices with building energy consumption. By displaying real-time consumption information, occupants see the immediate impact of their actions. The software can be used to promote energy conservation initiatives, offer advice to the occupants, or provide a forum for feedback on sustainability initiatives.

People-driven energy conservation programs, such as those sponsored by Energy Education, can be highly effective in reducing energy use and cost. 

Letting occupants know their real-time consumption alone can be responsible for a 7% reduction in energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americancity.org/afteroil/entry/1136/ "The Prius Effect"] by [http://americancity.org/afteroil/entry/1136/ Elizabeth Dickinson]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy monitoring and targeting''' (M&amp;T) is an energy efficiency technique based on the standard [[management]] axiom stating that “you cannot manage what you cannot measure”. M&amp;T techniques provide [[Energy engineering|energy manager]]s with feedback on operating practices, results of energy management projects, and guidance on the level of energy use that is expected in a certain period. Importantly, they also give early warning of unexpected excess consumption caused by equipment malfunctions, operator error, unwanted user behaviours, lack of effective maintenance and the like.

The foundation of M&amp;T lies in determining the normal relationships of energy consumptions to relevant driving factors (HVAC equipment, production though puts, weather, occupancy available daylight, etc.) and the goal is to help business managers:

* Identify and explain excessive energy use
* Detect instances when consumption is unexpectedly higher or lower than would usually have been the case
* Visualize energy consumption trends (daily, weekly, seasonal, operational…)
* Determine future energy use and costs when planning changes in the business
* Diagnose specific areas of wasted energy
* Observe how changes to relevant driving factors impact energy efficiency
* Develop performance targets for energy management programs
* Manage energy consumption, rather than accept it as a fixed cost

The ultimate goal is to reduce energy costs through improved [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and energy management control. Other benefits generally include increased resource efficiency, improved [[production, costs, and pricing|production]] budgeting and reduction of [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions.

==History==
M&amp;T is an established technique that was first launched as a national program in the [[UK]] in 1980, and has since then spread throughout Europe. These techniques are now{{When|date=July 2014}} also rapidly growing in America.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Goals and benefits==
Throughout the numerous M&amp;T projects implemented since the 1980s, a certain number of benefits have proved to be recurrent:
* Energy cost savings: generally 5% of the original energy expenses, according to [[The Carbon Trust]]. Carbon Trust has conducted a study over 1000 [[Small Business|small businesses]] and has concluded that on average an organization could save 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advanced metering for SMEs |url=https://www.carbontrust.com/media/77244/ctc713_advanced_metering_for_smes.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209000820/https://www.carbontrust.com/media/77244/ctc713_advanced_metering_for_smes.pdf |archivedate=December 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reduction in [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions: lower energy consumption helps reduce emissions
* Financing: measured energy reductions help obtain [[grant (money)|grants]] for energy efficiency projects
* Improved product and service costing: [[Utility submeter|sub-metering]] allows the division of the energy bill between the different processes of an [[industry]], and can be calculated as a [[production cost]]
* Improved [[budgeting]]: M&amp;T techniques can help forecast energy expenses in the case of changes in the business, for example
* Waste avoidance: helps diagnose energy waste in any process.

==Technique==

=== Key principles ===
Monitoring and Targeting techniques rely on three main principles, which form a constant [[feedback]] cycle, therefore improving control of energy use.

====Monitoring====
Monitoring [[information]] of energy use, in order to establish a basis for energy management and explain [[deviation (statistics)|deviations]] from an established pattern. Its primary goal is to maintain said pattern, by providing all the necessary data on energy consumption, as well as certain [[driving factors]], as identified during preliminary investigation ([[production, costs, and pricing|production]], weather, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodengineeringmag.com/articles/90655-energy-management-crunching-the-numbers|title=Energy management: crunching the numbers|last=Labs|first=Wayne|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Food Engineering Magazine|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reporting====
The final principle is the one which enables ongoing control of energy use, achievement of targets and verification of savings: reports must be issued to the appropriate managers. This in turn allows [[decision-making]] and actions to be taken in order to achieve the targets, as well as confirmation or denial that the targets have been reached.

===Procedures===
Before the M&amp;T measures themselves are implemented, a few preparatory steps are necessary. First of all, key energy consumers on the site must be identified. Generally, most of the energy consumption is concentrated in a small number of processes, like heating, or certain [[machinery]]. This normally requires a certain survey of the [[building]] and the equipment to estimate their energy consumption level.

It is also necessary to assess what other [[measurements]] will be required to [[analysis|analyze]] the consumption appropriately. This data will be used to [[chart]] against the energy consumption: these are underlying factors which influence the consumption, often [[production, costs, and pricing|production]] (for industry processes) or exterior [[temperature]] (for heating processes), but may include many other variables.

Once all variables to be measured have been established, and the necessary meters installed, it is possible to initiate the M&amp;T procedures.

====Measure====
The first step is to compile the data from the different meters.  Low-cost energy feedback displays have become available. The frequency at which the data is compiled varies according to the desired reporting interval, but can go once every 30 seconds to once every 15 minutes. Some measurements can be taken directly from the meters, others must be calculated. These different measurements are often called streams or channels.

Driving factors such as production or [[degree day]]s also constitute streams and must be collected at intervals to match.

====Define the base-line====
The data compiled must then be plotted on a [[chart|graph]] in order to define the general consumption base-line. Consumption rates are plotted in a [[scatter plot]] against [[production, costs, and pricing|production]] or any other variable previously identified, and the [[best fit line]] is identified. This graph is the image of the business’ average energy performance, and conveys a lot of information:

* The [[y-intercept]] gives the minimal consumption in the absence of the variable (no [[production, costs, and pricing|production]], zero [[degree-day]]...). This is the base load of the system, the minimal consumption when it is not operating.
* The [[slope]] represents the relationship between the consumption and the previously identified [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]. This represents the efficiency of the process.
* The scatter is the degree of variability of the consumption with operational factors.
The [[slope]] is not used quite as often for M&amp;T purposes. However, a high [[y-intercept]] can mean that there is a fault in the process, causing it to use too much energy with no performance, unless there are specific distinctive features which lead to high base loads. Very scattered points, on the other hand, may reflect other significant factors playing in the variation of the energy consumption, other than the one plotted in the first place, but it can also be the illustration of a lack of control over the process.

====Monitor variations====
The next step is to monitor the difference between the expected consumption and the actual measured consumption. One of the tools most commonly used for this is the [[control chart|CUSUM]], which is the CUmulative SUM of differences. This consists in first calculating the difference between the expected and actual performances (the [[best fit line]] previously identified and the points themselves).

The [[CUSUM]] can then be plotted against time on a new [[chart|graph]], which then yields more information for the energy efficiency specialist. [[Variance]]s scattered around zero usually mean that the process is operating normally. Marked variations, increasing or decreasing steadily usually reflect a modification in the conditions of the process.

[[Image:CUSUM graph.jpg|right|Example of a CUSUM graph]]In the case of the [[control chart|CUSUM]] graph, the [[slope]] becomes very important, as it is the main indicator of the [[savings]] achieved. A [[slope]] going steadily down indicates steady [[savings]]. Any variation in the [[slope]] indicates a change in the process. For example, in the graph on the right, the first section indicated no [[savings]]. However, in September (beginning of the yellow line), an energy efficiency measure must have been implemented, as [[savings]] start to occur. The green line indicates an increase in the [[savings]] (as the [[slope]] is becoming steeper), whereas the red line must reflect a modification in the process having occurred in November, as [[savings]] have decreased slightly.

====Identify causes====
Energy efficiency specialists, in collaboration with building [[managers]], will decipher the [[control chart|CUSUM]] graph and identify the causes leading to variations in the consumption. This can be a change in [[behaviour]], a modification to the process, different exterior conditions, etc. These changes must be monitored and the causes identified in order to promote and enhance good behaviour, and discourage bad ones.

====Set targets====
Once the base line has been established, and causes for variations in energy consumption have been identified, it is time to set targets for the future. Now with all this information in hand, the targets are more realistic, as they are based on the building’s actual consumption.
Targeting consists in two main parts: the measure to which the consumption can be reduced, and the [[timeframe]] during which the compression will be achieved.

A good initial target is the [[best fit line]] identified during step 2. This line represents the [[average]] historical performance. Therefore, keeping all consumption below or equal to the historical average is an achievable target, yet remains a challenge as it involves eliminating high consumption peaks.

Some companies, as they improve their energy consumption, might even decide to bring their [[average]] performance down to their historical best. This is considered a much more challenging target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicenergy.com/live-energy-monitoring/building-energy-use/case-studies/|title=Building Energy Generation &amp; Usage|work=Case Studies|publisher=Logic Energy|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Monitor results====
This brings us back to step 1: measure consumption. One of the specificities of M&amp;T is that it is an ongoing process, requiring constant [[feedback]] in order to consistently improve performance. Once the targets are set and the desired measures are implemented, repeating the procedure from the start ensures that the managers are aware of the success or failure of the measures, and can then decide on further action.

===Examples===
An example with some features of an M&amp;T application is the [[ASU Campus Metabolism]], which provides real-time and historic energy use and generation data for facilities of [[Arizona State University]] on a public web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cm.asu.edu/|title=DGLux5 by DGLogik|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many utilities also offer customers electric interval data monitoring services.

'''Energy rate density''' is the amount of [[Thermodynamic_free_energy|free energy]] per unit [[time]] per unit [[mass]] (in CGS metric units erg/s/g; in MKS units joule/s/kg).  It is terminologically (but not always numerically) equivalent to [[power density]] when measured in SI units of W/kg.  Regardless of the units used, energy rate density describes the flow of energy through any system of given mass, and has been proposed as a measure of system complexity. The more complex the system, the more energy flows per second through each gram. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2011 | title = Energy Rate Density as a Complexity Metric and Evolutionary Driver | url = https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/EnergyRateDensity_I_FINAL_2011.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Complexity | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 27–40 | doi = 10.1002/cplx.20323 | bibcode = 2011Cmplx..16c..27C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chaisson2014&gt;[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/big_history_review_Chaisson_TSWJ2014.pdf "The Natural Science Underlying Big History,"] ''The Scientific World Journal'', v 2014, 41 pgs, 2014; {{DOI|10.1155/2014/384912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interdisciplinary researchers prefer to use the general term, energy rate density, not only to stress the intuitive notion of energy flow (in contrast to more colloquial connotations of the word "power"), but also to unify its potential application among all the natural sciences,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/ASUessay_revised_for_CUP.pdf "Using Complexity Science to Search for Unity in the Natural Sciences,"] In ''Complexity and the Arrow of Time'', Lineweaver, Davies and Ruse (eds.), Cambridge Univ.

[[File:Generic energy system supplying fuels and electricity.svg|thumb|300px|Physical components of a generic energy system supplying fuels and electricity (but not [[district heating|district heat]]) to end-users]]

An '''energy system''' is a system primarily designed to supply [[#Energy-services|energy-services]] to [[end user|end-users]].&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}  Taking a structural viewpoint, the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] defines an energy system as "all components related to the production, conversion, delivery, and use of energy".&lt;ref name="allwood-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|1261}}  The field of [[energy economics]] includes [[energy market]]s and treats an energy system as the technical and economic systems that satisfy [[consumer demand]] for energy in the forms of [[heat]], [[fuel]]s, and [[electricity]].&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}

The first two definitions allow for demand-side measures, including [[daylighting]], retrofitted [[building insulation]], and [[passive solar building design]], as well as socio-economic factors, such as aspects of [[energy demand management]] and even [[telecommuting]], while the third does not.  Neither does the third account for the [[Informal sector|informal economy]] in traditional [[biomass]] that is significant in many [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name="van-ruijven-etal-2008"/&gt;

The analysis of energy systems thus spans the disciplines of [[engineering]] and [[economics]].&lt;ref name="hoffman-and-wood-1976"/&gt;{{rp|1}}  Merging ideas from both areas to form a coherent description, particularly where [[macroeconomic]] dynamics are involved, is challenging.&lt;ref name="boehringer-and-rutherford-2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="herbst-etal-2012"/&gt;

The concept of an energy system is evolving as new regulations, technologies, and practices enter into service – for example, [[emissions trading]], the development of [[smart grid]]s, and the greater use of [[energy demand management]], respectively.

== Treatment ==

{{see also|Energy industry|Energy modeling}}
&lt;!-- {(see also|Energy industry|Energy modeling|Open energy system models}} --&gt;

From a structural perspective, an energy system is like any [[System|general system]] and is made up of a set of interacting component parts, located within an environment.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster-system"/&gt;  These components derive from ideas found in [[engineering]] and [[economics]].  Taking a process view, an energy system "consists of an integrated set of technical and economic activities operating within a complex societal framework".&lt;ref name="hoffman-and-wood-1976"/&gt;{{rp|423}}  The identification of the components and behaviors of an energy system depends on the circumstances, the purpose of the analysis, and the questions under investigation.  The concept of an energy system is therefore an [[Abstraction (software engineering)|abstraction]] which usually precedes some form of computer-based investigation, such as the construction and use of a suitable [[energy modeling|energy model]].&lt;ref name="anandarajah-etal-2009"/&gt;

Viewed in engineering terms, an energy system lends itself to representation as a [[flow network]]: the [[Glossary of graph theory#vertex|vertices]] map to engineering components like [[power station]]s and [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and the [[Glossary of graph theory#edge|edges]] map to the interfaces between these components.  This approach allows collections of similar or adjacent components to be aggregated and treated as one to simplify the model.  Once described thus, flow network algorithms, such as [[minimum-cost flow problem|minimum cost flow]], may be applied.&lt;ref name="quelhas-etal-2007"/&gt;  The components themselves can be treated as simple [[dynamical systems]] in their own right.&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;

Conversely, relatively pure economic modeling may adopt a sectorial approach with only limited engineering detail present.  The sector and sub-sector categories published by the [[International Energy Agency]] are often used as a basis for this analysis.  A 2009 study of the UK residential energy sector contrasts the use of the technology-rich [[Markal model]] with several UK sectoral housing stock models.&lt;ref name="kannan-and-strachan-2007"/&gt;

International [[statistical study of energy data|energy statistics]] are typically broken down by carrier, sector and sub-sector, and country.&lt;ref name="ires-2016"/&gt;  Energy carriers ({{abbr|aka|also known as}} energy products) are further classified as [[primary energy]] and [[primary energy#Conversion to energy carriers (or secondary energy)|secondary]] (or intermediate) energy and sometimes final (or end-use) energy.  Published energy datasets are normally adjusted so that they are internally consistent, meaning that all energy stocks and flows must [[Energy balance (energy economics)|balance]].  The IEA regularly publishes energy statistics and energy balances with varying levels of detail and cost and also offers mid-term projections based on this data.&lt;ref name="iea-2016a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iea-2016b"/&gt;  The notion of an energy carrier, as used in [[energy economics]], is distinct and different from the definition of [[energy]] used in physics.

Energy systems can range in scope, from local, municipal, national, and regional, to global, depending on issues under investigation.  Researchers may or may not include demand side measures within their definition of an energy system.  The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] does so, for instance, but covers these measures in separate chapters on transport, buildings, industry, and agriculture.{{efn|The IPCC chapter on agriculture is titled: Agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU).}}&lt;ref name="allwood-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|1261}}&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|516}}

Household consumption and investment decisions may also be included within the ambit of an energy system.  Such considerations are not common because consumer behavior is difficult to characterize, but the trend is to include human factors in models.  Household decision-taking may be represented using techniques from [[bounded rationality]] and [[Agent-based model|agent-based behavior]].&lt;ref name="wittmann-and-bruckner-2009"/&gt;  The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) specifically advocates that "more attention should be paid to incorporating behavioral considerations other than price- and income-driven behavior into economic models [of the energy system]".&lt;ref name="aaas-2011"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

== Energy-services ==

{{see also|Energy conservation|Efficient energy use}}

The concept of an energy-service is central, particularly when defining the purpose of an energy system:

{{quote|It is important to realize that the use of energy is no end in itself but is always directed to satisfy human needs and desires. Energy services are the ends for which the energy system provides the means.&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}}}

Energy-services can be defined as amenities that are either furnished through energy consumption or could have been thus supplied.&lt;ref name="morrison-etal-2005"/&gt;{{rp|2}}  More explicitly:

{{quote|Demand should, where possible, be defined in terms of energy-service provision, as characterized by an appropriate intensity{{efn|The term ''intensity'' refers to quantities which do not scale with component size.  See [[intensive and extensive properties]].}} – for example, air [[temperature]] in the case of space-heating or [[lux]] levels for [[illuminance]]. This approach facilitates a much greater set of potential responses to the question of supply, including the use of energetically-passive techniques – for instance, retrofitted [[Building insulation|insulation]] and [[daylighting]].&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2003"/&gt;{{rp|156}}}}

A consideration of energy-services per capita and how such services contribute to human welfare and individual quality of life is paramount to the debate on [[sustainable energy]].  People living in poor regions with low levels of energy-services consumption would clearly benefit from greater consumption, but the same is not generally true for those with high levels of consumption.&lt;ref name="haas-etal-2008"/&gt;

The notion of energy-services has given rise to [[energy service company|energy-service companies]] (ESCo) who contract to provide energy-services to a client for an extended period.  The ESCo is then free to choose the best means to do so, including investments in the thermal performance and [[HVAC]] equipment of the buildings in question.&lt;ref name="duplessis-etal-2012"/&gt;

== ISO 13600, 13601, 13602 on technical energy systems ==

ISO{{nnbsp}}13600, ISO{{nnbsp}}13601, and ISO{{nnbsp}}13602 form a set of [[international standard]]s covering technical energy systems (TES).&lt;ref name="iso-13600-1997-main"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13600-1997-corrigendum-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13601-1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13602-2002"/&gt;  Although withdrawn prior to 2016, these documents provide useful definitions and a framework for formalizing such systems.  The standards depict an energy system broken down into supply and demand sectors, linked by the flow of tradable energy commodities (or energywares).  Each sector has a set of inputs and outputs, some intentional and some harmful byproducts.  Sectors may be further divided into subsectors, each fulfilling a dedicated purpose.  The demand sector is ultimately present to supply energyware-based services to consumers (see [[#Energy-services|energy-services]]).

 | quote = In energy economics, energy systems are usually defined as technical and economic systems meeting the energy demand.  "However, the energy demand is not a fixed quantity but is subject to various influences, e.g., prices, regulations, and consumer preferences. Thus, the definition of energy systems should provide a much broader, socioeconomic view and refer to the technical and economic side of energy supply as well as the socioeconomic phenomena occurring in a society, which uses energy to enhance its standard of living; furthermore the impact on the natural environment is important. ... It is important to realize that the use of energy is no end in itself but is always directed to satisfy human needs and desires. Energy services are the ends for which the energy system provides the means. (page 941)

 | quote = The energy system consists of an integrated set of technical and economic activities operating within a complex societal framework.  Energy is a vital component in the economic and social well-being of a nation and must be considered explicitly in the formulation of regional, national, and international policy.  As the importance of energy in policy making has become apparent, research and analysis in the field of energy system modeling and forecasting has grown rapidly.  The field has evolved from one almost exclusively the domain of planning groups in the major sectors of the energy industry and of government regulatory agencies to one in which many Federal and State agencies are active in the development and application of energy models and forecasts.  Energy system models are now used extensively for regional, national and international forecasting and for policy formulation and analysis.

'''Exertion''' is the [[Action (physics)|physical]] or perceived use of [[energy]].&lt;ref name=":07"&gt;Newton's Third Law, Elert, Glenn. “Forces.” ''Viscosity – The Physics Hypertextbook'', physics.info/newton-first/.&lt;/ref&gt; Exertion traditionally connotes a strenuous or costly ''effort,''resulting in generation of force, initiation of motion,&lt;ref name=":07" /&gt; or in the performance of [[Mechanical work|work]].&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; It often relates to [[Exercise physiology|muscular]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;activity and can be quantified, empirically and by measurable metabolic response.

==Physical==
In [[physics]], ''exertion'' is the expenditure of [[energy]] against, or inductive of, [[inertia]] as described by [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton.27s third law|third law of motion]]. In physics, '''force''' exerted equivocates '''work''' done.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Perceived Exertion, Barry, A. J. (1967). Physical activity and psychic stress/strain. ''Canadian Medical Association Journal'', ''96''(12), 848–853.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to do work can be either positive or negative depending on the direction of exertion relative to gravity. For example, a force exerted upwards, like lifting an object, creates positive work done on that object.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://physics.bu.edu/~duffy/py105/Energy.html|title=Work and energy|website=physics.bu.edu|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exertion often results in force generated, a contributing dynamic of general motion.&lt;ref name=":07" /&gt; In [[mechanics]] it describes the use of [[force]] against a [[Physical body|body]] in the direction of its [[Motion (physics)|motion]] (see [[Vector (geometric)|vector]]).

==Physiological==
Exertion, physiologically, can be described by the initiation of exercise, or, intensive and exhaustive physical activity that causes cardiovascular stress or a sympathetic nervous response. This can be continuous or intermittent exertion.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Exertion requires, of the body, modified oxygen uptake, increased heart rate, and autonomic monitoring of blood [[Lactate dehydrogenase|lactate]] concentrations. Mediators of physical exertion include cardio-respiratory and [[Human musculoskeletal system|musculoskeletal]] strength, as well as metabolic capability.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Kumar, Shrawan. “Theories of Occupational Musculoskeletal Injury Causation.” ''Biomechanics in Ergonomics, Second Edition'', July 2007, doi:10.1201/9780849379093.sec1.&lt;/ref&gt; This often correlates to an output of force followed by a [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]] of recovery. Exertion is limited by cumulative load and repetitive motions.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Muscular energy reserves, or stores for [[Biomechanics|biomechanical]] exertion, stem from metabolic, immediate production of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and increased O2 consumption.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Muscular exertion generated depends on the muscle length and the velocity at which it is able to shorten, or contract.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;“Golgi Tendon Organ.” ''Egyptian Journal of Medical Human Genetics'', Elsevier, www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/golgi-tendon-organ.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perceived exertion can be explained as subjective, perceived experience that mediates response to somatic sensations and mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A [[rating of perceived exertion]], as measured by the ''RPE-scale'', or [[Borg scale]], is a quantitative measure of physical exertion.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borg|first=Gunnar A.V|date=|title=Psychophysical bases of perceived exertion|url=http://fcesoftware.com/images/15_Perceived_Exertion.pdf|journal=Symposium|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often in health, exertion of oneself resulting in cardiovascular stress showed reduced physiological responses, like cortisol levels and mood, to stressors. Therefore, biological exertion is effective in mediating psychological exertion, responsive to environmental stress.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Gröpel, Peter, et al. “Endurance- and Resistance-Trained Men Exhibit Lower Cardiovascular Responses to Psychosocial Stress Than Untrained Men.” ''Frontiers in Psychology'', vol. 9, Jan. 2018, doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00852.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overexertion causes more than 3.5 million injuries a year.{{Clarify|reason=when, where|date=November 2018}} An overexertion injury can include sprains or strains, the stretching and tear of ligaments, tendons, or muscles caused by a load that exceeds the human ability to perform the work.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;“Indications Of Physical Overexertion.” ''JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association'', vol. 71, no. 18, Feb. 1918, p. 1488., doi:10.1001/jama.1918.02600440040013.&lt;/ref&gt; Overexertion, besides causing acute injury, implies physical exertion beyond the person's capacity which leads to symptoms such as dizziness, irregular breathing and heart rate, and fatigue.&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt; Preventative measures can be taken based on biomechanical knowledge to limit possible overexertion injuries.&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;“The Understated Injury: Overexertion.” ''Healthline'', Healthline Media, www.healthline.com/health/understated-injury-overexertion.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually the [[Logarithmic timeline|logarithmic scale]] is used for such timelines but it compresses the most interesting Stelliferous Era too much as [[Future of an expanding universe#Graphical timeline|this]] example shows. Therefore, a [[Logarithm#Related operations and generalizations|double-logarithmic]] scale ''s'' (''s*100'' in the graphics) is used instead. The minimum of it is only 1, not 0 as needed, and the negative outputs for inputs smaller than 10 are useless. Therefore, the time from 0.1 to 10 years is collapsed to a single point 0, but that does not matter in this case because nothing special happens in the history of the universe during that time.

'''Hardness''' is a measure of the resistance to localized plastic deformation induced by either mechanical indentation or abrasion. Some materials (e.g. [[Metal|metals]]) are harder than others (e.g. [[Plastic|plastics]], [[wood]]). Macroscopic hardness is generally characterized by strong [[intermolecular bond]]s, but the behavior of solid materials under force is complex; therefore, there are different measurements of hardness: ''scratch hardness'', ''indentation hardness'', and ''rebound hardness''.

Hardness is dependent on [[ductility]], [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] [[stiffness]], [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]], [[deformation (mechanics)|strain]], [[Strength of materials|strength]], [[toughness]], [[viscoelasticity]], and [[viscosity]].

Common examples of '''hard matter''' are [[ceramic]]s, [[concrete]], certain [[metal]]s, and [[superhard material]]s, which can be contrasted with [[soft matter]].

==Measuring hardness==
[[Image:Vickers-tester.jpg|thumb|A Vickers hardness tester]]

There are three main types of hardness measurements: ''scratch'', ''indentation'', and ''rebound''. Within each of these classes of measurement there are individual measurement scales. For practical reasons [[hardness comparison|conversion tables]] are used to convert between one scale and another.

===Scratch hardness{{Anchor|Scratch hardness}}===

{{main|Scratch hardness}}

Scratch hardness is the measure of how resistant a sample is to [[fracture]] or permanent [[plastic deformation]] due to friction from a sharp object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wredenberg|first=Fredrik|author2=PL Larsson|title=Scratch testing of metals and polymers: Experiments and numerics|journal=Wear|date=2009|doi=10.1016/j.wear.2008.05.014|volume=266|issue=1–2|pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is that an object made of a harder material will scratch an object made of a softer material. When testing coatings, scratch hardness refers to the force necessary to cut through the film to the substrate. The most common test is [[Mohs scale]], which is used in [[mineralogy]]. One tool to make this measurement is the [[sclerometer]].

Another tool used to make these tests is the pocket hardness tester. This tool consists of a scale arm with graduated markings attached to a four-wheeled carriage. A scratch tool with a sharp rim is mounted at a predetermined angle to the testing surface. In order to use it a weight of known mass is added to the scale arm at one of the graduated markings, the tool is then drawn across the test surface. The use of the weight and markings allows a known pressure to be applied without the need for complicated machinery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.byk.com/en/instruments/products/download.php?doc=74 Hoffman Scratch Hardness Tester] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323002752/https://www.byk.com/en/instruments/products/download.php?doc=74 |date=2014-03-23 }}. byk.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indentation hardness===
{{main|Indentation hardness}}

Indentation hardness measures the resistance of a sample to material deformation due to a constant compression load from a sharp object. Tests for indentation hardness are primarily used in [[engineering]] and [[metallurgy]] fields. The tests work on the basic premise of measuring the critical dimensions of an indentation left by a specifically dimensioned and loaded indenter.

Common indentation hardness scales are [[Rockwell scale|Rockwell]], [[Vickers hardness test|Vickers]], [[Shore scale|Shore]], and [[Brinell hardness test|Brinell]], amongst others.

===Rebound hardness===
Rebound hardness, also known as ''dynamic hardness'', measures the height of the "bounce" of a diamond-tipped hammer dropped from a fixed height onto a material. This type of hardness is related to [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]. The device used to take this measurement is known as a [[scleroscope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Allen | first = Robert | title = A guide to rebound hardness and scleroscope test | date = 2006-12-10 | url = http://www.articlestree.com/science/a-guide-to-rebound-hardness-and-scleroscope-test-tx301428.html | accessdate = 2008-09-08 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120718022923/http://www.articlestree.com/science/a-guide-to-rebound-hardness-and-scleroscope-test-tx301428.html | archivedate = 2012-07-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two scales that measures rebound hardness are the [[Leeb rebound hardness test]] and [[Bennett hardness scale]].

==Hardening==
{{Main|Hardening (metallurgy)}}

There are five hardening processes: [[Hall-Petch strengthening]], [[work hardening]], [[solid solution strengthening]], [[precipitation hardening]], and [[martensitic transformation]].

==Physics==
[[Image:stress-strain1.svg|thumb|Diagram of a [[stress-strain curve]], showing the relationship between [[Stress (physics)|stress]] (force applied per unit area) and [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] or [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] of a ductile metal.]]

In [[solid mechanics]], solids generally have three responses to [[force]], depending on the amount of force and the type of material:
* They exhibit [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]—the ability to temporarily change shape, but return to the original shape when the pressure is removed. "Hardness" in the elastic range—a small temporary change in shape for a given force—is known as [[stiffness]] in the case of a given object, or a high [[elastic modulus]] in the case of a material.
* They exhibit [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]]—the ability to permanently change shape in response to the force, but remain in one piece. The [[Yield (engineering)|yield strength]] is the point at which elastic deformation gives way to plastic deformation. Deformation in the plastic range is non-linear, and is described by the [[stress-strain curve]]. This response produces the observed properties of scratch and indentation hardness, as described and measured in materials science. Some materials exhibit both [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and [[viscosity]] when undergoing plastic deformation; this is called [[viscoelasticity]].
* They [[fracture]]—split into two or more pieces.

[[Strength of materials|Strength]] is a measure of the extent of a material's elastic range, or elastic and plastic ranges together. This is quantified as [[compressive strength]], [[shear strength]], [[tensile strength]] depending on the direction of the forces involved. [[Ultimate strength]] is an engineering measure of the maximum load a part of a specific material and geometry can withstand.

[[Brittleness]], in technical usage, is the tendency of a material to fracture with very little or no detectable plastic deformation beforehand. Thus in technical terms, a material can be both brittle and strong. In everyday usage "brittleness" usually refers to the tendency to fracture under a small amount of force, which exhibits both brittleness and a lack of strength (in the technical sense). For perfectly brittle materials, yield strength and ultimate strength are the same, because they do not experience detectable plastic deformation. The opposite of brittleness is [[ductility]].

The [[toughness]] of a material is the maximum amount of [[energy]] it can absorb before fracturing, which is different from the amount of [[force]] that can be applied. Toughness tends to be small for brittle materials, because elastic and plastic deformations allow materials to absorb large amounts of energy.

Hardness increases with decreasing [[particle size]]. This is known as the [[Hall-Petch relationship]]. However, below a critical grain-size, hardness decreases with decreasing grain size. This is known as the inverse Hall-Petch effect.

Hardness of a material to deformation is dependent on its microdurability or small-scale [[shear modulus]] in any direction, not to any [[Stiffness|rigidity]] or [[stiffness]] properties such as its [[bulk modulus]] or [[Young's modulus]]. Stiffness is often confused for hardness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Jeandron | first = Michelle | title = Diamonds are not forever | journal = Physics World | date = 2005-08-25 | url = http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/22997 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090215064216/http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/22997 | archivedate = 2009-02-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = San-Miguel | first = A. | last2 = Blase | first2 = P. | title = High Pressure Behavior of Silicon Clathrates: A New Class of Low Compressibility Materials | journal = Physical Review | volume = 83 | issue = 25 | date = 1999-05-19 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.5290 | pages = 5290 | last3 = Blase | first3 = X. | last4 = Mélinon | first4 = P. | last5 = Perez | first5 = A. | last6 = Itié | first6 = J. | last7 = Polian | first7 = A. | last8 = Reny | first8 = E. | last9 = Cros | first9 = C. | last10 = Pouchard | first10 = M. | bibcode=1999PhRvL..83.5290S| display-authors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some materials are stiffer than diamond (e.g. osmium) but are not harder, and are prone to [[spall]]ing and flaking in squamose or acicular habits.

===Mechanisms and theory===
[[Image:Close-packed spheres.jpg|thumb|A representation of the crystal lattice showing the planes of atoms.]]

The key to understanding the mechanism behind hardness is understanding the metallic [[microstructure]], or the structure and arrangement of the atoms at the atomic level. In fact, most important metallic properties critical to the manufacturing of today’s goods are determined by the microstructure of a material.&lt;ref name="Haasen"&gt;Haasen, P. (1978). Physical metallurgy. Cambridge [Eng.] ; New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; At the atomic level, the atoms in a metal are arranged in an orderly three-dimensional array called a [[crystal lattice]]. In reality, however, a given specimen of a metal likely never contains a consistent single crystal lattice. A given sample of metal will contain many grains, with each grain having a fairly consistent array pattern. At an even smaller scale, each grain contains irregularities.

There are two types of irregularities at the grain level of the microstructure that are responsible for the hardness of the material. These irregularities are point defects and line defects. A point defect is an irregularity located at a single lattice site inside of the overall three-dimensional lattice of the grain. There are three main point defects. If there is an atom missing from the array, a [[vacancy defect]] is formed. If there is a different type of atom at the lattice site that should normally be occupied by a metal atom, a substitutional defect is formed. If there exists an atom in a site where there should normally not be, an [[interstitial defect]] is formed. This is possible because space exists between atoms in a crystal lattice. While point defects are irregularities at a single site in the crystal lattice, line defects are irregularities on a plane of atoms. [[Dislocations]] are a type of line defect involving the misalignment of these planes. In the case of an edge dislocation, a half plane of atoms is wedged between two planes of atoms. In the case of a screw dislocation two planes of atoms are offset with a helical array running between them.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel, J. (2009). ''Introduction to materials science course manual''. Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin-Madison.&lt;/ref&gt;

In glasses, hardness seems to depend linearly on the number of topological constraints acting between the atoms of the network.&lt;ref name=mauro2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smedskjaer|first=Morten M.|author2=John C. Mauro |author3=Yuanzheng Yue |title=Prediction of Glass Hardness Using Temperature-Dependent Constraint Theory|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|year=2010|volume=105|issue=11|page=2010|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.115503|pmid=20867584|bibcode=2010PhRvL.105k5503S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the [[Rigidity theory (physics)|rigidity theory]] has allowed predicting hardness values with respect to composition.

[[Image:Dislocation edge d2.jpg|thumb|right|Planes of atoms split by an edge dislocation.]]

Dislocations provide a mechanism for planes of atoms to slip and thus a method for plastic or permanent deformation.&lt;ref name="Haasen" /&gt;  Planes of atoms can flip from one side of the dislocation to the other effectively allowing the dislocation to traverse through the material and the material to deform permanently. The movement allowed by these dislocations causes a decrease in the material's hardness.

The way to inhibit the movement of planes of atoms, and thus make them harder, involves the interaction of dislocations with each other and interstitial atoms. When a dislocation intersects with a second dislocation, it can no longer traverse through the crystal lattice. The intersection of dislocations creates an anchor point and does not allow the planes of atoms to continue to slip over one another&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, W. C. (1981). The physical metallurgy of steels. Washington: Hempisphere Pub. Corp., New York: McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0070377804}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A dislocation can also be anchored by the interaction with interstitial atoms. If a dislocation comes in contact with two or more interstitial atoms, the slip of the planes will again be disrupted. The interstitial atoms create anchor points, or pinning points, in the same manner as intersecting dislocations.

By varying the presence of interstitial atoms and the density of dislocations, a particular metal's hardness can be controlled. Although seemingly counter-intuitive, as the density of dislocations increases, there are more intersections created and consequently more anchor points. Similarly, as more interstitial atoms are added, more pinning points that impede the movements of dislocations are formed. As a result, the more anchor points added, the harder the material will become.

[[Andreas Cellarius]], German mathematician and cartographer (1596–1665), conceived an Atlas of the Universe, published in 1660, under the title of ''[[Harmonia Macrocosmica]]''. Numerous illustrations of the solar system appear in this atlas by different authors known at that time. Referring to Ptolemy, Cellarius called the representation of this Ptolemaic conception of heaven as "Imago universi secundum Ptolaeum"

''Imago'' is a word in [[Latin]] which means'' 'image''' or even "representation". Therefore, the title expresses the "Picture of the Universe according to Ptolemy." The Latin expression was used in the Middle Ages to express the representation and size of the known world at that time.

''Imago Universi'' is also the title, in Latin, of a [[cosmography|cosmographic]] treatise, written in 2013 by the Spanish scientist Gabriel Barceló.

After analyzing the history of cosmology, the treatise delves into the prevailing scientific lack of explanation of the rotation of the heavenly bodies in the laws of dynamic behaviour of the sidereal system. The author proposes the application of the [[Theory of Dynamic Interactions]] (TID) to astrophysics, in particular, the dynamics of stellar systems and galaxies. This theory allows new comprehension of the dynamics of nature and understands the dynamic equilibrium of the universe, always subjected to rotational accelerations, but repetitive and persistent. The author also highlights that the orbiting always coincides with the intrinsic rotation of celestial bodies. Paradox incorporating the book, noting that this had not been found to date.

{{Cosmology|comp/struct}}
The '''ΛCDM''' ('''Lambda cold dark matter''') or '''Lambda-CDM''' model is a [[parametrization]] of the [[Big Bang]] [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] model in which the universe contains a [[cosmological constant]], denoted by [[Lambda]] ([[Greek alphabet|Greek]] '''Λ'''), associated with [[dark energy]], and [[cold dark matter]] (abbreviated '''CDM'''). It is frequently referred to as the '''standard model''' of Big Bang cosmology because it is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of the following properties of the cosmos:
* the existence and structure of the [[cosmic microwave background]]
* the [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|large-scale structure]] in the distribution of galaxies
* the [[abundance of the chemical elements|abundances]] of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|hydrogen (including deuterium), helium, and lithium]]
* the accelerating [[metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]] observed in the light from distant galaxies and [[supernova]]e

The model assumes that [[general relativity]] is the correct theory of gravity on cosmological scales.
It emerged in the late 1990s as a '''concordance cosmology''', after a period of time when disparate observed properties of the universe appeared mutually inconsistent, and there was no consensus on the makeup of the energy density of the universe.

The ΛCDM model can be extended by adding [[cosmological inflation]], [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] and other elements that are current areas of speculation and research in cosmology.

Some alternative models challenge the assumptions of the ΛCDM model. Examples of these are [[modified Newtonian dynamics]], modified gravity, theories of large-scale variations in the matter density of the universe, and scale invariance of empty space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maeder|first=Andre|date=2017|title=An Alternative to the ΛCDM Model: The Case of Scale Invariance|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0004-637X/834/i=2/a=194|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|language=en|volume=834|issue=2|pages=194|doi=10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/194|issn=0004-637X|arxiv=1701.03964|bibcode=2017ApJ...834..194M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pavel Kroupa|P.

==Overview==
[[File:Lambda-Cold Dark Matter, Accelerated Expansion of the Universe, Big Bang-Inflation.jpg|thumb|upright=2.4|Lambda-CDM, accelerated expansion of the universe. The time-line in this schematic diagram extends from the Big Bang/inflation era 13.7 Byr ago to the present cosmological time.]]
Most modern cosmological models are based on the [[cosmological principle]], which states that our observational location in the universe is not unusual or special; on a large-enough scale, the universe looks the same in all directions ([[isotropy]]) and from every location ([[homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]]).&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Liddle. ''An Introduction to Modern Cosmology (2nd ed.).'' London: Wiley, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The model includes an expansion of metric space that is well documented both as the [[red shift]] of prominent spectral absorption or emission lines in the light from distant galaxies and as the time dilation in the light decay of supernova luminosity curves. Both effects are attributed to a [[Doppler shift]] in electromagnetic radiation as it travels across expanding space. Although this expansion increases the distance between objects that are not under shared gravitational influence, it does not increase the size of the objects (e.g. galaxies) in space. It also allows for distant galaxies to recede from each other at speeds greater than the speed of light; local expansion is less than the speed of light, but expansion summed across great distances can collectively exceed the speed of light.

The letter &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; (lambda) represents the [[cosmological constant]], which is currently associated with a vacuum energy or [[dark energy]] in empty space that is used to explain the contemporary accelerating expansion of space against the attractive effects of gravity. A cosmological constant has negative pressure, &lt;math&gt; p = - \rho c^{2} &lt;/math&gt;, which contributes to the [[stress-energy tensor]] that, according to the general theory of relativity, causes accelerating expansion. The fraction of the total energy density of our (flat or almost flat) universe that is dark energy, &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{\Lambda}&lt;/math&gt;, is currently (2015) estimated to be 0.692 ± 0.012, or even 0.6911 ± 0.0062 based on [[Planck satellite]] data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/planck-upholds-standard-cosmology-0210201523/ Camille M. Carlisle, ''Planck Upholds Standard Cosmology'', Sky &amp; Telescope, February 10, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dark matter]] is postulated in order to account for gravitational effects observed in very large-scale structures (the "flat" [[rotation curve]]s of galaxies; the [[gravitational lens]]ing of light by galaxy clusters; and enhanced clustering of galaxies) that cannot be accounted for by the quantity of observed matter. [[Cold dark matter]] is ''non-[[baryon]]ic'', i.e. it consists of matter other than protons and neutrons (and electrons, by convention, although electrons are not baryons); ''cold'', i.e. its velocity is far less than the speed of light at the epoch of radiation-matter equality (thus neutrinos are excluded, being non-baryonic but not cold); ''dissipationless'', i.e. it cannot cool by radiating photons; and ''collisionless'', i.e. the dark matter particles interact with each other and other particles only through gravity and possibly the weak force. The dark matter component is currently (2013) estimated to constitute about 26.8% of the mass-energy density of the universe.

The remaining 4.9% (2013) comprises all ordinary matter observed as atoms, chemical elements, gas and plasma, the stuff of which visible planets, stars and galaxies are made. The great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is unseen, since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10% of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass-energy density of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Also, the energy density includes a very small fraction (~ 0.01%) in cosmic microwave background radiation, and not more than 0.5% in [[relic neutrinos]]. Although very small today, these were much more important in the distant past, dominating the matter at redshift &gt; 3200.

The model includes a single originating event, the "Big Bang", which was not an explosion but the abrupt appearance of expanding [[space-time]] containing radiation at temperatures of around 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; K. This was immediately (within 10&lt;sup&gt;−29&lt;/sup&gt; seconds) followed by an exponential expansion of space by a scale multiplier of 10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; or more, known as [[cosmic inflation]]. The early universe remained hot (above 10,000 K) for several hundred thousand years, a state that is detectable as a residual [[cosmic microwave background]], or CMB, a very low energy radiation emanating from all parts of the sky. The "Big Bang" scenario, with cosmic inflation and standard particle physics, is the only current cosmological model consistent with the observed continuing expansion of space, the observed distribution of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|lighter elements in the universe]] (hydrogen, helium, and lithium), and the spatial texture of minute irregularities ([[Anisotropy|anisotropies]]) in the CMB radiation. Cosmic inflation also addresses the "[[horizon problem]]" in the CMB; indeed, it seems likely that the universe is larger than the observable [[particle horizon]].

The model uses the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]], the [[Friedmann equations]] and the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|cosmological equations of state]] to describe the observable universe from right after the [[Timeline of the Big Bang#Inflationary epoch|inflationary epoch]] to present and future.

== Cosmic expansion history ==
The expansion of the universe is parametrized by a [[dimensionless]] [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] &lt;math&gt;a = a(t)&lt;/math&gt; (with time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; counted from the birth of the universe), defined relative to the present day, so &lt;math&gt;a_0 = a(t_0) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;; the usual convention in cosmology is that subscript 0 denotes present-day values, so &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the current age of the universe. The scale factor is related to the observed [[Redshift#Expansion of space|redshift]]&lt;ref name="Dodelson"/&gt; &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; of the light emitted at time &lt;math&gt;t_\mathrm{em}&lt;/math&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over a(t_\mathrm{em})} = 1 + z.&lt;/math&gt;
The expansion rate is described by the time-dependent [[Hubble parameter]], &lt;math&gt;H(t)&lt;/math&gt;, defined as
:&lt;math&gt;H(t) \equiv \frac{\dot a}{a},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\dot a&lt;/math&gt; is the time-derivative of the scale factor.  The first [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann equation]] gives the expansion rate in terms of the matter+radiation density {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;,}} the [[Curvature of the universe|curvature]] {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;,}} and the [[cosmological constant]] {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;,}}&lt;ref name="Dodelson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodelson|first1=Scott|title=Modern cosmology|date=2008|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|location=San Diego, CA [etc.]|isbn=978-0122191411|edition=4. [print.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H^2 = \left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \rho - \frac{kc^2}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3}, &lt;/math&gt;

where as usual {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;}} is the speed of light and {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;}} is the [[gravitational constant]]. 
A critical density &lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{crit}&lt;/math&gt; is the present-day density, which gives zero curvature &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, assuming the cosmological constant &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is zero, regardless of its actual value. Substituting these conditions to the Friedmann equation gives

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{crit} = \frac{3 H_0^2}{8 \pi G} = 1.878\;47(23) \times 10^{-26} \; h^2 \; \text{kg} \; \text{m}^{-3},&lt;/math&gt;{{refn|name=constants|{{cite web|url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2015/reviews/rpp2014-rev-astrophysical-constants.pdf |title=The Review of Particle Physics. 2.

where &lt;math&gt; h \equiv H_0 / (100 \; \mathrm{km \; s^{-1} \; Mpc^{-1}}) &lt;/math&gt; is the reduced Hubble constant.
If the cosmological constant were actually zero, the critical density would also mark the dividing line between eventual recollapse of the universe to a [[Big Crunch]], or unlimited expansion. For the Lambda-CDM model with a positive cosmological constant (as observed), the universe is predicted to expand forever regardless of whether the total density is slightly above or below the critical density; though other outcomes are possible in extended models where the [[dark energy]] is not constant but actually time-dependent.

It is standard to define the present-day '''density parameter''' &lt;math&gt;\Omega_x&lt;/math&gt; for various species as the dimensionless ratio
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_x \equiv \frac{\rho_x(t=t_0)}{\rho_\mathrm{crit} } = \frac{8 \pi G\rho_x(t=t_0)}{3 H_0^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where the subscript &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is one of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; for [[Baryon|baryons]], &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; for [[cold dark matter]], &lt;math&gt;rad&lt;/math&gt; for [[radiation]] ([[Photon|photons]] plus relativistic [[Neutrino|neutrinos]]), and &lt;math&gt;DE&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; for [[dark energy]].

Since the densities of various species scale as different powers of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, e.g. &lt;math&gt;a^{-3}&lt;/math&gt; for matter etc.,
the [[Friedmann equation]] can be conveniently rewritten in terms of the various density parameters as
:&lt;math&gt;H(a) \equiv \frac{\dot{a}}{a} = H_0 \sqrt{ (\Omega_c + \Omega_b) a^{-3} + \Omega_\text{rad} a^{-4} + \Omega_k a^{-2} + \Omega_{DE} a^{-3(1+w)} } &lt;/math&gt;
where w is the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] of dark energy, and assuming negligible neutrino mass (significant neutrino mass requires a more complex equation). The various &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; parameters add up to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; by construction.
In the general case this is integrated by computer to give
the expansion history &lt;math&gt;a(t)&lt;/math&gt; and also observable distance-redshift relations for any chosen values of the cosmological parameters, which can then be compared with observations such as [[supernovae]] and [[baryon acoustic oscillations]].

In the minimal 6-parameter Lambda-CDM model, it is assumed that curvature &lt;math&gt;\Omega_k&lt;/math&gt; is zero and &lt;math&gt; w = -1 &lt;/math&gt;, so this simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt; H(a) = H_0 \sqrt{ \Omega_m a^{-3} + \Omega_\text{rad} a^{-4} + \Omega_\Lambda } &lt;/math&gt;

Observations show that the radiation density is very small today, &lt;math&gt; \Omega_\text{rad} \sim 10^{-4} &lt;/math&gt;; if this term is neglected
the above has an analytic solution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frieman|first1=Joshua A.|last2=Turner|first2=Michael S.|last3=Huterer|first3=Dragan|title=Dark Energy and the Accelerating Universe|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|year=2008|volume=46|issue=1|pages=385–432|arxiv=0803.0982|doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.46.060407.145243|bibcode=2008ARA&amp;A..46..385F}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; a(t) = (\Omega_m / \Omega_\Lambda)^{1/3} \, \sinh^{2/3} ( t / t_\Lambda) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; t_\Lambda \equiv 2 / (3 H_0 \sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda} ) \ ; &lt;/math&gt;
this is fairly accurate for &lt;math&gt;a &gt; 0.01&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;t &gt; 10&lt;/math&gt;million years.
Solving for &lt;math&gt; a(t) = 1 &lt;/math&gt; gives the present age of the universe &lt;math&gt; t_0 &lt;/math&gt; in terms of the other parameters.

It follows that the transition from decelerating to accelerating expansion (the second derivative &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a} &lt;/math&gt; crossing zero) occurred when
:&lt;math&gt; a = ( \Omega_m / 2 \Omega_\Lambda )^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;

which evaluates to &lt;math&gt;a \sim 0.6&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;z \sim 0.66&lt;/math&gt; for the best-fit parameters estimated from the [[Planck spacecraft]].

==Historical development==
The discovery of the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] (CMB) in 1964 confirmed a key prediction of the [[Big Bang]] cosmology. From that point on, it was generally accepted that the universe started in a hot, dense state and has been expanding over time. The rate of expansion depends on the types of matter and energy present in the universe, and in particular, whether the total density is above or below the so-called critical density. During the 1970s, most attention focused on pure-baryonic models, but there were serious challenges explaining the formation of galaxies, given the small anisotropies in the CMB (upper limits at that time). In the early 1980s, it was realized that this could be resolved if cold dark matter dominated over the baryons, and the theory of [[cosmic inflation]] motivated models with critical density. During the 1980s, most research focused on cold dark matter with critical density in matter, around 95% CDM and 5% baryons: these showed success at forming galaxies and clusters of galaxies, but problems remained; notably, the model required a Hubble constant lower than preferred by observations, and observations around 1988-1990 showed more large-scale galaxy clustering than predicted. These difficulties sharpened with the discovery of CMB anisotropy by [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] in 1992, and several modified CDM models, including ΛCDM and mixed cold and hot dark matter, came under active consideration through the mid-1990s. The ΛCDM model then became the leading model following the observations of [[Accelerating universe|accelerating expansion]] in 1998, and was quickly supported by other observations: in 2000, the [[BOOMERanG]] microwave background experiment measured the total (matter–energy) density to be close to 100% of critical, whereas in 2001 the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dFGRS]] galaxy redshift survey measured the matter density to be near 25%; the large difference between these values supports a positive Λ or [[dark energy]]. Much more precise spacecraft measurements of the microwave background from [[WMAP]] in 2003 – 2010 and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] in 2013 - 2015 have continued to support the model and pin down the parameter values, most of which are now constrained below 1 percent uncertainty.

There is currently active research into many aspects of the ΛCDM model, both to refine the parameters and possibly detect deviations. In addition, ΛCDM has no explicit physical theory for the origin or physical nature of dark matter or dark energy; the nearly scale-invariant spectrum of the CMB perturbations, and their image across the celestial sphere, are believed to result from very small thermal and acoustic irregularities at the point of recombination. A large majority of astronomers and astrophysicists support the ΛCDM model or close relatives of it, but [[Mordehai Milgrom|Milgrom]], [[Stacy McGaugh|McGaugh]], and [[Pavel Kroupa|Kroupa]] are leading critics, attacking the dark matter portions of the theory from the perspective of [[galaxy formation]] models and supporting the alternative [[MOND]] theory, which requires a modification of the [[Einstein field equations]] and the [[Friedmann equations]] as seen in proposals such as [[MOG theory]] or [[Tensor–vector–scalar gravity|TeVeS theory]]. Other proposals by theoretical astrophysicists of cosmological alternatives to Einstein's general relativity that attempt to account for dark energy or dark matter include [[f(R) gravity]], [[Scalar–tensor theory|scalar–tensor theories]] such as [[galileon]] theories, [[brane cosmology|brane cosmologies]], the [[DGP model]], and [[massive gravity]] and its extensions such as [[bimetric theory|bimetric gravity]].

==Successes==
In addition to explaining pre-2000 observations,
the model has made a number of successful predictions: notably the existence of the
[[baryon acoustic oscillation]] feature, discovered in 2005 in the predicted location; and the statistics of weak [[gravitational lensing]], first observed in 2000 by several teams. The [[Cosmic microwave background#Polarization|polarization]] of the CMB, discovered in 2002 by DASI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kovac|first1=J. M.|last2=Leitch|first2=E.

The six free parameters can be well constrained by the TT spectrum alone, and then the TE and EE spectra can be predicted theoretically to few-percent precision with no further adjustments allowed: comparison of theory and observations shows an excellent match.

==Challenges==
Extensive searches for dark matter particles have so far shown no well-agreed detection;
the dark energy may be almost impossible to detect in a laboratory, and its value is [[cosmological constant problem|unnaturally small]] compared to [[vacuum energy|naive theoretical predictions]].

Comparison of the model with observations is very successful on large scales (larger than galaxies, up to the observable horizon), but may have some problems on sub-galaxy scales, possibly predicting [[Dwarf galaxy problem|too many dwarf galaxies]] and too much dark matter in the innermost regions of galaxies. This problem is called the "small scale crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The simple ΛCDM model is based on six [[parameter]]s: physical baryon density parameter; physical dark matter density parameter; the age of the universe; scalar spectral index; curvature fluctuation amplitude; and reionization optical depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The dark side of the cosmology: dark matter and dark energy|author=Spergel, D. N.|journal=Science|volume=347|issue=6226|year=2015|doi=10.1126/science.aaa0980|pmid=25745164|pages=1100–1102|bibcode=2015Sci...347.1100S}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with [[Occam's razor]], six is the smallest number of parameters needed to give an acceptable fit to current observations; other possible parameters are fixed at "natural" values, e.g. total density parameter = 1.00, dark energy equation of state = −1. (See below for extended models that allow these to vary.)

The values of these six parameters are mostly not predicted by current theory (though, ideally, they may be related by a future "[[Theory of Everything]]"), except that most versions of [[cosmic inflation]] predict the scalar spectral index should be slightly smaller than 1, consistent with the estimated value 0.96. The parameter values, and uncertainties, are estimated using large computer searches to locate the region of parameter space providing an acceptable match to cosmological observations. From these six parameters, the other model values, such as the [[Hubble's law|Hubble constant]] and the [[dark energy]] density, can be readily calculated.

Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the [[cosmic microwave background]] anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including the [[baryon acoustic oscillation]] feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, [[weak gravitational lensing]] and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less precisely measured at present.

Parameter values listed below are from the Planck Collaboration Cosmological parameters 68% confidence limits for the base ΛCDM model from Planck CMB power spectra, in combination with lensing reconstruction and external data (BAO + JLA + H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Planck Collaboration | title = Planck 2015 results.

==Missing baryon problem==
{{main article|Missing baryon problem}}
Massimo Persic and Paolo Salucci&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0502178.pdf The baryon content of the universe, M. Persic and P. Salucci, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; firstly estimated the baryonic density today present in ellipticals, spirals, groups and clusters of galaxies.
They performed an integration of the baryonic mass-to-light ratio over luminosity (in the following &lt;math display="inline"&gt;  M_b/L &lt;/math&gt;), weighted with the luminosity function &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\phi(L)&lt;/math&gt; over the previously mentioned classes of astrophysical objects: 

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_b = \sum \int L\phi(L) \frac{M_b}{L} \, dL.&lt;/math&gt;

The result was:

:&lt;math&gt; \Omega_b=\Omega_*+\Omega_\text{gas}=2.2\times10^{-3}+1.5\times10^{-3}h^{-1.3}\simeq0.003&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; h\simeq0.72 &lt;/math&gt;.

Note that this value is much lower than the prediction of standard cosmic nucleosynthesis &lt;math&gt; \Omega_b\simeq0.048 &lt;/math&gt;, so that stars and gas in galaxies and in galaxy groups and clusters account for less than 10% of the primordially synthesized baryons. This issue is known as the problem of the "missing baryons".

Extended models allow one or more of the "fixed" parameters above to vary, in addition to the basic six; so these models join smoothly to the basic six-parameter model in the limit that the additional parameter(s) approach the default values. For example, possible extensions of the simplest ΛCDM model allow for spatial curvature (&lt;math&gt;\Omega_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; may be different from 1); or [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] rather than a [[cosmological constant]] where the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] of dark energy is allowed to differ from −1. Cosmic inflation predicts tensor fluctuations ([[gravitational wave]]s). Their amplitude is parameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio (denoted &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;), which is determined by the unknown energy scale of inflation. Other modifications allow [[hot dark matter]] in the form of [[neutrino]]s more massive than the minimal value, or a running spectral index; the latter is generally not favoured by simple cosmic inflation models.

Allowing additional variable parameter(s) will generally ''increase'' the uncertainties in the standard six parameters quoted above, and may also shift the central values slightly. The Table below shows results for each of the possible "6+1" scenarios with one additional variable parameter; this indicates that, as of 2015, there is no convincing evidence that any additional parameter is different from its default value.

Some researchers have suggested that there is a running spectral index, but no statistically significant study has revealed one. Theoretical expectations suggest that the tensor-to-scalar ratio &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; should be between 0 and 0.3, and the latest results are now within those limits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5018">[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]
[[Image:Samuel Clarke.jpg|thumb|Samuel Clarke.]]
The '''Leibniz–Clarke correspondence''' was a [[scientific]], [[theological]] and [[philosophical]] [[debate]] conducted in an exchange of letters between the [[Germany|German]] thinker [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and [[Samuel Clarke]], an [[England|English]] supporter of [[Isaac Newton]] during the years 1715 and 1716.  The exchange began because of a letter Leibniz wrote to [[Caroline of Ansbach]], in which he remarked that Newtonian physics was detrimental to [[natural theology]].  Eager to defend the Newtonian view, Clarke responded, and the correspondence continued until the death of Leibniz in 1716.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a variety of subjects is touched on in the letters, the main interest for modern readers is in the dispute between the [[Absolute time and space|absolute]] theory of [[space]] favoured by Newton and Clarke, and Leibniz's [[Relational space|relational]] approach.  Also important is the conflict between Clarke's and Leibniz's opinions on [[free will]] and whether God must create the [[best of all possible worlds]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz had published only a book on moral matters, the ''[[Theodicy|Theodicée]]'' (1710), and his more metaphysical views had never been exposed to a sufficient extent, so the collected letters were met with interest by their contemporaries. The priority dispute between [[Leibniz and Newton calculus controversy|Leibniz and Newton about the calculus]] was still fresh in the public's mind and it was taken as a matter of course that it was Newton himself who stood behind Clarke's replies.

==Editions==
The Leibniz-Clarke letters were first published under Clarke's name in the year following Leibniz' death.&lt;ref&gt;''A Collection of Papers, which passed between the late Learned Mr. Leibniz, and Dr. Clarke, In the Years 1715 and 1716'', by Samuel Clarke D.D. (London:  James Knapton, 1717)&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a preface, took care of the translation from French, added notes and some of his own writing. In 1720 [[Pierre Desmaizeaux]] published a similar volume in a French translation,&lt;ref&gt;''Recueil de pièces diverses sur la philosophie la religion et l'histoire par Leibniz, Clarke et Newton'', publiées par Pierre Desmaizeaux, Amsterdam, 1720&lt;/ref&gt; including quotes from Newton's work. It is quite certain that for both editions the opinion of Newton himself has been sought and Leibniz left at a disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoloni-Melli D., ''Newton and the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence'',  The Cambridge Companion to Newton,   eds. I. B. Cohen and G. E. Smith, Cambridge University Press,  2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  However the German translation of the correspondence published by Kohler, also in 1720,&lt;ref&gt;''Merckwurdige Schriften welche . . . zwischen dem Herrn Baron von Leibniz und dem Herrn D. Clarke über besondere Materien der naturlichen Religion'' in Franzos. und Englischer Sprache gewechselt und . . . in teutscher Sprache herausgegeben worden von Heinrich Kohler, Frankfurt and Leipzig (Jena), 1720: there was a preface by [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] and a reply to Clarke's last letter in  behalf of Leibniz by Ludwig Philipp Thümmig; it appeared also in the latin translation from 1740.&lt;/ref&gt; contained a reply to Clarke's last letter which Leibniz had not been able to answer. The letters have been reprinted in most collections of Leibniz' works and regularly published in stand alone editions.&lt;ref&gt;A full list is given in Alexander H., ''The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence'',  with extracts from Newton's ''Principia'' and ''Opticks'', edited with an introduction and notes, Manchester, 1955 (and reeditions); for a more recent edition see e.g.

A '''material''' is a [[chemical substance]] or [[mixture]] of substances that constitute an object. Materials can be pure or impure, a singular composite or a complex mix, living or non-living matter, whether natural or man-made, either concrete or abstract. Materials can be classified based on different properties such as [[physical property|physical]] and [[chemical property|chemical properties]] (see [[List of materials properties]]), [[geological]], [[biological]], choreographical, or [[property (philosophy)|philosophical properties]]. In the physical sense, materials are studied in the field of [[materials science]].

In [[industry]], materials are inputs to [[wiktionary:production|production]] or [[list of manufacturing processes|manufacturing processes]]. They may either be [[raw material]], that is, unprocessed, or processed before being used in more advanced production processes, either by [[distillation]] or [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] (synthetic materials).

Types of materials include:
*[[Biomaterial]], of biological origin
*[[Composite material]], composed of multiple materials with differing physical properties
*[[Textile]]s, sometimes referred to as "material"
*[[Genetic material]]

==Classification of materials==
Materials are classified according to many different criteria including their physical and chemical characteristics as well as their intended applications whether it is thermal, optical, electrical, magnetic, or combined. As their methods of usage dictate their physical appearance, they can be designed, tailored, and/or prepared in many forms such as powders, thin or thick films, and plates and could be introduced/studied in a single or multi layers. End products could be pure materials or doped ones with most useful compounds are those with controlled added impurities.The dopants could be added chemically or mixed and implanted physically. In case the impurities were added chemically, the dopants/co-dopants on substitutional/interstitial sites should be optimized and investigated thoroughly as well as any stresses instigated by their presence within the structure; whereas in the case of the physical mixing, the influence of the degree of heterogeneity of the prepared hybrid composites ought to be studied.The different physical and chemical preparation techniques can be used solely or combined including solid state synthesis, hydrothermal, sol-gel, precipitations and coprecipitations, spin coating, physical vapor deposition, and spray pyrolysis. Types of impurities along with their amounts are usually dictated by types of matrices to be added to, and their ability to maximize the desired products’ usefulness. Among the most commonly used characterization techniques are X-ray diffraction (XRD) either single crystal or powder, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), UV-Vis absorption Spectroscopy, Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR), and Photoluminescence spectrometry. In addition, it is usually considered of extreme importance to find theoretical models that can confirm and/or predict the experimental findings and assist in discussion, assignment, and the explanation of results and outcomes. Also, vision and room for future modification and development should always be pinpointed. Hence, one can classify the material as a smart one if its presence can serve multi purposes within the final product.

{{quantum mechanics}}
'''Matter waves''' are a central part of the theory of [[quantum mechanics]], being an example of [[wave–particle duality]]. All [[matter]] can exhibit [[wave]]-like behavior. For example, a beam of [[electron]]s can be [[diffraction|diffracted]] just like a beam of light or a water wave. The concept that matter behaves like a wave was proposed by [[Louis de Broglie]] ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|b|r|ɔɪ}}) in 1924. It is also referred to as the ''de Broglie hypothesis''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Feynman|Feynman, R.]], ''[[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]]'', Penguin 1990 Edition, page 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Matter waves are referred to as ''de Broglie waves''.

The ''de Broglie wavelength'' is the [[wavelength]], {{math|''λ''}}, associated with a massive particle and is related to its [[momentum]], {{math|''p''}}, through the [[Planck constant]], {{math|''h''}}:
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{p}=\frac{h}{mv}.&lt;/math&gt;

Wave-like behavior of matter was first experimentally demonstrated by [[George Paget Thomson]]'s thin metal diffraction experiment,&lt;ref name=GPTdiff&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thomson, G. P. | title = Diffraction of Cathode Rays by a Thin Film | journal = Nature | volume = 119 | issue = 3007 | pages = 890 | year = 1927 | doi = 10.1038/119890a0 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v119/n3007/pdf/119890a0.pdf | format = PDF |bibcode = 1927Natur.119Q.890T }}&lt;/ref&gt; and independently in the [[Davisson–Germer experiment]] both using electrons, and it has also been confirmed for other [[elementary particle]]s, neutral [[atom]]s and even [[molecule]]s. Recently, it was also found that investigating the elementary process of diffusion gives the theoretical evidence of the relation of matter wave, regardless of the photon energy.&lt;ref&gt;Okino, T. (2018) Quantum Effect on Elementary Process of Diffusion and Collective Motion of Brown Particles, Journal Modern Physics 9, pp. 1007-1028.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus revealed that the relation of matter wave is now not a hypothesis but an actual equation relevant to a characteristic of micro particle. The wave-like behavior of matter is crucial to the modern theory of atomic  structure and [[particle physics]].

==Historical context==
At the end of the 19th century, light was thought to consist of waves of electromagnetic fields which propagated according to [[Maxwell's equations]], while matter was thought to consist of localized particles (See [[wave–particle duality#Brief history of wave and particle viewpoints|history of wave and particle viewpoints]]). In 1900, this division was exposed to doubt, when, investigating the theory of black body thermal radiation, [[Max Planck]] proposed that light is emitted in discrete quanta of energy. It was thoroughly challenged in 1905. Extending Planck's investigation in several ways, including its connection with the [[photoelectric effect]], [[Albert Einstein]] proposed that light is also propagated and absorbed in quanta. Light quanta are now called [[photon]]s. These quanta would have an energy given by the [[Planck–Einstein relation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;E=h\nu&lt;/math&gt;
and a momentum
:&lt;math&gt;p=\frac{E}{c}=\frac{h}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''ν''}} (lowercase [[Nu (letter)|Greek letter nu]]) and {{math|''λ''}} (lowercase [[Lambda|Greek letter lambda]]) denote the frequency and wavelength of the light, {{math|''c''}} the speed of light, and {{math|''h''}} the [[Planck constant]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein|Einstein, A.]] (1917).

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern convention, frequency is symbolized by ''f'' as is done in the rest of this article. Einstein’s postulate was confirmed experimentally by [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Robert Millikan]] and [[Arthur Compton]] over the next two decades.

==de Broglie hypothesis==
[[File:Propagation of a de broglie wave.svg|290px|"290px"|right|thumb|Propagation of '''de Broglie waves''' in 1d – real part of the [[complex number|complex]] amplitude is blue, imaginary part is green. The probability (shown as the color [[opacity (optics)|opacity]]) of finding the particle at a given point ''x'' is spread out like a waveform; there is no definite position of the particle. As the amplitude increases above zero the [[curvature]] decreases, so the amplitude decreases again, and vice versa. The result is an alternating amplitude: a wave. Top: [[plane wave]]. Bottom: [[wave packet]].]]
De Broglie, in his 1924 PhD thesis, proposed that just as light has both wave-like and particle-like properties, [[electron]]s also have wave-like properties. By rearranging the momentum equation stated in the above section, we find a relationship between the [[wavelength]], {{math|''λ''}} associated with an electron and its [[momentum]], {{math|''p''}}, through the [[Planck constant]], {{math|''h''}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{p}.&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship is now known to hold for all types of matter: all matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves.

{{quote|When I conceived the first basic ideas of wave mechanics in 1923–24, I was guided by the aim to perform a real physical synthesis, valid for all particles, of the coexistence of the wave and of the corpuscular aspects that Einstein had introduced for photons in his theory of light quanta in 1905.|De Broglie&lt;ref&gt;Louis de Broglie [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n170347gr6h82147/ "The Reinterpretation of Wave Mechanics" Foundations of Physics, Vol. 1 No. 1 (1970)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1926, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] published an [[Schrödinger equation|equation]] describing how a matter wave should evolve—the matter wave analogue of [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell’s equations]]—and used it to derive the [[Emission spectrum|energy spectrum]] of [[hydrogen]].

==Experimental confirmation==
[[File:Wave-particle duality.gif|right|thumb|200px|Demonstration of a matter wave in diffraction of electrons]]

Matter waves were first experimentally confirmed to occur in [[George Paget Thomson]]'s cathode ray diffraction experiment&lt;ref name=GPTdiff/&gt; and the [[Davisson–Germer experiment|Davisson-Germer experiment]] for electrons, and the de Broglie hypothesis has been confirmed for other elementary particles. Furthermore, neutral atoms and even molecules have been shown to be wave-like.

===Electrons===
{{further|Davisson–Germer experiment|Electron diffraction}}
In 1927 at Bell Labs, [[Clinton Davisson]] and [[Lester Germer]] [[Davisson–Germer experiment|fired]] slow-moving [[electron]]s at a [[crystal]]line [[nickel]] target. The angular dependence of the diffracted electron intensity was measured, and was determined to have the same [[diffraction|diffraction pattern]] as those predicted by [[William Lawrence Bragg|Bragg]] for [[x-ray]]s. At the same time George Paget Thomson at the University of Aberdeen was independently firing electrons at very thin metal foils to demonstrate the same effect.&lt;ref name=GPTdiff/&gt; Before the acceptance of the de Broglie hypothesis, diffraction was a property that was thought to be exhibited only by waves. Therefore, the presence of any [[diffraction]] effects by matter demonstrated the wave-like nature of matter. When the de Broglie wavelength was inserted into the [[Bragg's law|Bragg condition]], the observed diffraction pattern was predicted, thereby experimentally confirming the de Broglie hypothesis for electrons.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro Dardo, ''Nobel Laureates and Twentieth-Century Physics'', Cambridge University Press 2004, pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a pivotal result in the development of [[quantum mechanics]]. Just as the [[photoelectric effect]] demonstrated the particle nature of light, the [[Davisson–Germer experiment]] showed the wave-nature of matter, and completed the theory of [[wave–particle duality]]. For [[physicist]]s this idea was important because it meant that not only could any particle exhibit wave characteristics, but that one could use [[wave equation]]s to describe phenomena in matter if one used the de Broglie wavelength.

The effect has also been used to explain the spatial version of the [[quantum Zeno effect]], in which an otherwise unstable object may be stabilised by rapidly repeated observations.&lt;ref name="zeno"/&gt;

===Molecules===
Recent experiments even confirm the relations for molecules and even [[macromolecule]]s that otherwise might be supposed too large to undergo quantum mechanical effects. In 1999, a research team in [[Vienna]] demonstrated diffraction for molecules as large as [[fullerene]]s.&lt;ref name="Arndt 680–682"&gt;{{cite journal| title=Wave-particle duality of C60| first=M.| last=Arndt| author2=O.

Still one step further than Louis De Broglie go theories which in quantum mechanics eliminate the concept of a pointlike classical particle and explain the observed facts by means of wavepackets of matter waves alone.&lt;ref&gt;See section VI(e) of Everett's thesis: ''The Theory of the Universal Wave Function'', in [[Bryce Seligman DeWitt]], [[R.

==de Broglie relations&lt;!--This section is linked to by [[de Broglie relations]]--&gt;==
The de Broglie equations relate the [[wavelength]] {{math|''λ''}} to the [[momentum]] {{math|''p''}}, and [[frequency]] {{math|''f''}} to the total energy {{math|''E''}} of a particle:&lt;ref name="Resnick 1985"&gt;{{cite book |title=Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles |edition=2nd |first=R. |last=Resnick |first2=R. |last2=Eisberg |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |date=1985 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-87373-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

In each pair, the second equation is also referred to as the [[Planck–Einstein relation]], since it was also proposed by [[Max Planck|Planck]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]].

===Special relativity===
Using two formulas from [[special relativity]], one for the [[Momentum#Relativistic|relativistic momentum]] and one for the relativistic mass energy

:&lt;math&gt;E = m c^2 = \gamma m_0 c^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{p} = m\vec{v} = \gamma m_0 \vec{v} &lt;/math&gt;

allows the equations to be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}&amp;\lambda =\,\, \frac {h}{\gamma m_0v}\, =\, \frac {h}{m_0v}\,\,\,\, \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\\
&amp; f = \frac{\gamma\,m_0c^2}{h} = \frac {m_0c^2}{h} \bigg/ \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; denotes the particle's [[Invariant mass|rest mass]], &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; its [[velocity]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the [[Lorentz factor]], and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stationary states |first=Alan |last=Holden |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1971 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-501497-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, W.S.C. (2002). ''Introducing Special Relativity'', Taylor &amp; Francis, London, {{ISBN|0-415-27761-2}}, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Broglie, L. (1970). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n170347gr6h82147/ The reinterpretation of wave mechanics, ''Foundations of Physics'' '''1'''(1): 5–15, p. 9.]&lt;/ref&gt; See below for details of the derivation of the de Broglie relations. Group velocity (equal to the particle's speed) should not be confused with [[phase velocity]] (equal to the product of the particle's frequency and its wavelength). In the case of a non-[[dispersion relation|dispersive medium]], they happen to be equal, but otherwise they are not.

====Group velocity====
[[Albert Einstein]] first explained the [[wave–particle duality]] of light in 1905.  [[Louis de Broglie]] hypothesized that any particle should also exhibit such a duality. The velocity of a particle, he concluded, should always equal the group velocity of the corresponding wave. The magnitude of the group velocity is equal to the particle's speed.

Both in relativistic and non-relativistic quantum physics, we can identify the group velocity of a particle's wave function with the particle velocity.  [[Quantum mechanics]] has very accurately demonstrated this hypothesis, and the relation has been shown explicitly for particles as large as [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name="Arndt 680–682"/&gt;

De Broglie deduced that if the duality equations already known for light were the same for any particle, then his hypothesis would hold.  This means that

:&lt;math&gt;v_g = \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k} = \frac{\partial (E/\hbar)}{\partial (p/\hbar)} = \frac{\partial E}{\partial p}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''E''}} is the total [[energy]] of the particle, {{math|''p''}} is its [[momentum]], {{math|''ħ''}} is the reduced Planck constant. For a free non-relativistic particle it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \left( \frac{1}{2}\frac{p^2}{m} \right)\\
    &amp;= \frac{p}{m}\\
    &amp;= v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''}} is the [[mass]] of the particle and {{math|''v''}} its velocity.

Also in [[special relativity]] we find that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \left( \sqrt{p^2c^2+m_0^2c^4} \right)\\
    &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{\sqrt{p^2c^2 + m_0^2c^4}}\\
    &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{E}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the rest mass of the particle and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum. But (see below), using that the phase velocity is {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''E''/''p'' {{=}} ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''v''}}, therefore

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{E}\\
    &amp;= \frac{c^2}{v_p}\\
    &amp;= v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''v''}} is the velocity of the particle regardless of wave behavior.

====Phase velocity====
In [[quantum mechanics]], particles also behave as waves with [[complex number|complex]] phases. The [[phase velocity]] is equal to the product of the frequency multiplied by the wavelength.

By the de Broglie hypothesis, we see that

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{E/\hbar}{p/\hbar} = \frac{E}{p}. &lt;/math&gt;

Using [[special relativity|relativistic]] relations for energy and momentum, we have

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{E}{p} = \frac{m c^2}{m v} = \frac{\gamma m_0 c^2}{\gamma m_0 v} = \frac{c^2}{v} = \frac{c}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is the total energy of the particle (i.e. [[Invariant mass#Rest energy|rest energy]] plus [[kinetic energy]] in the [[Kinematics|kinematic]] sense), ''p'' the [[momentum]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the [[Lorentz factor]], ''c'' the [[speed of light]], and β the speed as a fraction of ''c''. The variable ''v'' can either be taken to be the speed of the particle or the group velocity of the corresponding matter wave. Since the particle speed &lt;math&gt;v &lt; c &lt;/math&gt; for any particle that has mass (according to [[special relativity]]), the phase velocity of matter waves always exceeds ''c'', i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} &gt; c, \,&lt;/math&gt;

and as we can see, it approaches ''c'' when the particle speed is in the relativistic range. The [[Faster-than-light|superluminal]] phase velocity does not violate special relativity, because phase propagation carries no energy. See the article on ''[[Dispersion (optics)#Group and phase velocity|Dispersion (optics)]]'' for details.

===Four-vectors===
{{Main|Four-vector}}

Using four-vectors, the De Broglie relations form a single equation:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}= \hbar\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt;

which is [[Inertial frame of reference|frame]]-independent.

Likewise, the relation between group/particle velocity and phase velocity is given in frame-independent form by:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega_o}{c^2}\right)\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:[[Four-momentum]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = \left(\frac{E}{c}, \vec{\mathbf{p}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:[[Four-vector#Four-wavevector|Four-wavevector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}, \vec{\mathbf{k}} \right) = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}, \frac{\omega}{v_p}\mathbf{\hat{n}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:[[Four-velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U} = \gamma(c,\vec{\mathbf{u}}) = \gamma(c,v_g \hat{\mathbf{n}}) &lt;/math&gt;

==Interpretations==
The physical reality underlying de Broglie waves is a subject of ongoing debate. Some theories treat either the particle or the wave aspect as its fundamental nature, seeking to explain the other as an [[Emergence|emergent property]]. Some, such as the [[hidden variable theory]], treat the wave and the particle as distinct entities. Yet others propose some intermediate entity that is neither quite wave nor quite particle but only appears as such when we measure one or the other property. The [[Copenhagen interpretation]] states that the nature of the underlying reality is unknowable and beyond the bounds of scientific inquiry.

Schrödinger's quantum mechanical waves are conceptually different from ordinary physical waves such as water or sound. Ordinary physical waves are characterized by undulating real-number 'displacements' of dimensioned physical variables at each point of ordinary physical space at each instant of time. Schrödinger's "waves" are characterized by the undulating value of a dimensionless complex number at each point of an abstract multi-dimensional space, for example of configuration space.

At the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927, [[Max Born]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] reported as follows:

{{quote|If one wishes to calculate the probabilities of excitation and ionization of atoms [M. Born, Zur Quantenmechanik der Stossvorgange, ''Z. f. Phys.'', '''37''' (1926), 863; [Quantenmechanik der Stossvorgange], ''ibid.'', '''38''' (1926), 803] then one must introduce the coordinates of the atomic electrons as variables on an equal footing with those of the colliding electron. The waves then propagate no longer in three-dimensional space but in multi-dimensional configuration space. From this one sees that the quantum mechanical waves are indeed something quite different from the light waves of the classical theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1928). Quantum mechanics, pp. 143–181 of ''Électrons et Photons: Rapports et Discussions du Cinquième Conseil de Physique, tenu à Bruxelles du 24 au 29 Octobre 1927, sous les Auspices de l'Institut International de Physique Solvay'', Gauthier-Villars, Paris, p. 166; this translation at p. 425 of Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009), ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the same conference, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] reported likewise.

{{quote|Under [the name 'wave mechanics',] at present two theories are being carried on, which are indeed closely related but not identical. The first, which follows on directly from the famous doctoral thesis by L. de Broglie, concerns waves in three-dimensional space. Because of the strictly relativistic treatment that is adopted in this version from the outset, we shall refer to it as the ''four-dimensional'' wave mechanics. The other theory is more remote from Mr de Broglie's original ideas, insofar as it is based on a wave-like process in the space of ''position coordinates'' (''q''-space) of an arbitrary mechanical system.[Long footnote about manuscript not copied here.] We shall therefore call it the ''multi-dimensional'' wave mechanics. Of course this use of the ''q''-space is to be seen only as a mathematical tool, as it is often applied also in the old mechanics; ultimately, in this version also, the process to be described is one in space and time. In truth, however, a complete unification of the two conceptions has not yet been achieved. Anything over and above the motion of a single electron could be treated so far only in the ''multi''-dimensional version; also, this is the  one that provides the mathematical solution to the problems posed by the Heisenberg-Born matrix mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger, E.]] (1928). Wave mechanics, pp. 185–206 of ''Électrons et Photons: Rapports et Discussions du Cinquième Conseil de Physique, tenu à Bruxelles du 24 au 29 Octobre 1927, sous les Auspices de l'Institut International de Physique Solvay'', Gauthier-Villars, Paris, pp. 185–186; this translation at p. 447 of Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009), ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1955, Heisenberg reiterated this:

{{quote|An important step forward was made by the work of Born [''Z. Phys.'', '''37''': 863, 1926 and '''38''': 803, 1926] in the summer of 1926. In this work, the wave in configuration space was interpreted as a probability wave, in order to explain collision processes on Schrödinger's theory. This hypothesis contained two important new features in comparison with that of [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]], [[Hans Kramers|Kramers]] and [[John C. Slater|Slater]]. The first of these was the assertion that, in considering "probability waves", we are concerned with processes not in ordinary three-dimensional space, but in an abstract configuration space (a fact which is, unfortunately, sometimes overlooked even today); the second was the recognition that the probability wave is related to an individual process.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1955). The development of the interpretation of the quantum theory, pp. 12–29, in ''[[Niels Bohr]] and the Development of Physics: Essays dedicated to Niels Bohr on the occasion of his seventieth birthday'', edited by [[Wolfgang Pauli|W. Pauli]], with the assistance of [[Léon Rosenfeld|L. Rosenfeld]] and [[Victor Weisskopf|V. Weisskopf]], Pergamon Press, London, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is mentioned above that the "displaced quantity" of the Schrödinger wave has values that are dimensionless complex numbers. One may ask what is the physical meaning of those numbers. According to Heisenberg, rather than being of some ordinary physical quantity such as, for example, Maxwell's electric field intensity, or mass density, the Schrödinger-wave packet's "displaced quantity" is probability amplitude. He wrote that instead of using the term 'wave packet', it is preferable to speak of a probability packet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1927). Über den anschlaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik, ''Z. Phys.'' '''43''': 172–198, translated by eds. [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler, J.A.]], [[Wojciech Zurek|Zurek, W.H.]] (1983), at pp. 62–84 of ''Quantum Theory and Measurement'', Princeton University Press, Princeton NJ, p. 73. Also translated as 'The actual content of quantum theoretical kinematics and mechanics' [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19840008978.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; The probability amplitude supports calculation of probability of location or momentum of discrete particles. Heisenberg recites Duane's account of particle diffraction by probabilistic quantal translation momentum transfer, which allows, for example in Young's two-slit experiment, each diffracted particle probabilistically to pass discretely through a particular slit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1930). ''The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory'', translated by C. Eckart, F. C. Hoyt, University of Chicago Press, Chicago IL, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus one does not need necessarily think of the matter wave, as it were, as 'composed of smeared matter'.

These ideas may be expressed in ordinary language as follows. In the account of ordinary physical waves, a 'point' refers to a position in ordinary physical space at an instant of time, at which there is specified a 'displacement' of some physical quantity. But in the account of quantum mechanics, a 'point' refers to a configuration of the system at an instant of time, every particle of the system being in a sense present in every 'point' of configuration space, each particle at such a 'point' being located possibly at a different position in ordinary physical space. There is no explicit definite indication that, at an instant, this particle is 'here' and that particle is 'there' in some separate 'location' in configuration space. This conceptual difference entails that, in contrast to de Broglie's pre-quantum mechanical wave description, the quantum mechanical probability packet description does not directly and explicitly express the Aristotelian idea, referred to by Newton, that causal efficacy propagates through ordinary space by contact, nor the Einsteinian idea that such propagation is no faster than light. In contrast, these ideas are so expressed in the classical wave account, through the [[Green's function]], though it is inadequate for the observed quantal phenomena. The physical reasoning for this was first recognized by Einstein.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, A. (1986).

Miller, Plenum Press, New York, {{ISBN|978-1-4684-8773-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==De Broglie's phase wave and periodic phenomenon==
De Broglie's thesis started from the hypothesis, "that to each portion of energy with a proper mass {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} one may associate a periodic phenomenon of the frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} , such that one finds: {{math|''hν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is to be measured, of course, in the rest frame of the energy packet. This hypothesis is the basis of our theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Broglie | first1 = L. | authorlink = Louis de Broglie | year = 1923 | title = Waves and quanta | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 112 | issue = 2815| page = 540 | doi=10.1038/112540a0| bibcode = 1923Natur.112..540D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis de Broglie|de Broglie, L.]] (1924).

De Broglie followed his initial hypothesis of a periodic phenomenon, with frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, associated with the energy packet. He used the special theory of relativity to find, in the frame of the observer of the electron energy packet that is moving with velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, that its frequency was apparently reduced to

:&lt;math&gt;f = \nu_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
 
Then
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda f = E/p=v_\mathrm p\,.&lt;/math&gt;

using the same notation as above. The quantity &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm p&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of what de Broglie called the "phase y wave". Its wavelength is &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. De Broglie reasoned that his hypothetical intrinsic particle periodic phenomenon is in phase with that phase wave. This was his basic matter wave conception. He noted, as above, that &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm p &gt; c&lt;/math&gt;, and the phase wave does not transfer energy.&lt;ref name="Medicus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009). ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}, pp. 30–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the concept of waves being associated with matter is correct, de Broglie did not leap directly to the final understanding of quantum mechanics with no missteps. There are conceptual problems with the approach that de Broglie took in his thesis that he was not able to resolve, despite trying a number of different fundamental hypotheses in different papers published while working on, and shortly after publishing, his thesis.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Martins"&gt;{{cite web

These difficulties were resolved by [[Erwin Schrödinger]], who developed the wave mechanics approach, starting from a somewhat different basic hypothesis.

However, in [[quantum physics]], [[organic chemistry]], and [[biochemistry]], the term ''molecule'' is often used less strictly, also being applied to [[polyatomic ion]]s.

In the [[kinetic theory of gases]], the term ''molecule'' is often used for any gaseous [[particle]] regardless of its composition. According to this definition, [[noble gas]] atoms are considered molecules as they are monatomic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Chandra| first= Sulekh| title= Comprehensive Inorganic Chemistry| date= 2005| publisher= New Age Publishers| isbn= 81-224-1512-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A molecule may be [[homonuclear]], that is, it consists of atoms of one [[chemical element]], as with [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); or it may be [[heteronuclear]], a [[chemical compound]] composed of more than one element, as with [[water (molecule)|water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). Atoms and complexes connected by [[non-covalent interactions]], such as [[hydrogen bond]]s or [[ionic bond]]s, are generally not considered single molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title= Molecule|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|date =22 January 2016|url=http://global.britannica.com/science/molecule|access-date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molecules as components of matter are common in organic substances (and therefore biochemistry). They also make up most of the oceans and atmosphere. However, the majority of familiar solid substances on Earth, including most of the minerals that make up the [[Crust (geology)|crust]], [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], and [[Earth core|core of the Earth]], contain many chemical bonds, but are ''not'' made of identifiable molecules. Also, no typical molecule can be defined for [[ionic crystal]]s ([[salt (chemistry)|salts]]) and covalent crystals ([[network solid]]s), although these are often composed of repeating [[unit cell]]s that extend either in a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] (such as in [[graphene]]) or three-dimensionally (such as in [[diamond]], [[quartz]], or [[sodium chloride]]). The theme of repeated unit-cellular-structure also holds for most condensed phases with [[metallic bond]]ing, which means that solid metals are also not made of molecules. In [[glass]]es (solids that exist in a vitreous disordered state), atoms may also be held together by chemical bonds with no presence of any definable molecule, nor any of the regularity of repeating units that characterizes crystals.

== Molecular science ==

The science of molecules is called ''molecular chemistry'' or ''[[molecular physics]]'', depending on whether the focus is on chemistry or physics. Molecular chemistry deals with the laws governing the interaction between molecules that results in the formation and breakage of [[chemical bond]]s, while molecular physics deals with the laws governing their structure and properties. In practice, however, this distinction is vague. In molecular sciences, a molecule consists of a stable system ([[bound state]]) composed of two or more [[atom]]s. [[Polyatomic ion]]s may sometimes be usefully thought of as electrically charged molecules. The term ''unstable molecule'' is used for very [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] species, i.e., short-lived assemblies ([[Resonance (chemistry)|resonances]]) of electrons and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], such as [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]], molecular [[ion]]s, [[Rydberg molecule]]s, [[transition state]]s, [[van der Waals bonding|van der Waals complexes]], or systems of colliding atoms as in [[Bose–Einstein condensate]].

== History and etymology ==
{{Main|History of molecular theory}}

According to [[Merriam-Webster]] and the [[Online Etymology Dictionary]], the word "molecule" derives from the [[Latin]] "[[Mole (unit)|moles]]" or small unit of mass.
* '''Molecule''' (1794)&amp;nbsp;– "extremely minute particle", from French ''{{linktext|molécule}}'' (1678), from [[New Latin]] ''{{linktext|molecula}}'', diminutive of Latin ''{{linktext|moles}}'' "mass, barrier". A vague meaning at first; the vogue for the word (used until the late 18th century only in Latin form) can be traced to the philosophy of [[René Descartes|Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|molecule|accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=molecule|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/molecule|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of the molecule has evolved as knowledge of the structure of molecules has increased. Earlier definitions were less precise, defining molecules as the smallest [[list of particles#Molecules|particles]] of pure [[chemical substance]]s that still retain their [[chemical compound|composition]] and chemical properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/glossary/m.shtml#molecule Molecule Definition] ([[Frostburg State University]])&lt;/ref&gt; This definition often breaks down since many substances in ordinary experience, such as [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], and [[metal]]s, are composed of large crystalline networks of [[chemical bond|chemically bonded]] atoms or [[ion]]s, but are not made of discrete molecules.

== Bonding ==

Molecules are held together by either [[covalent bonding]] or [[ionic bonding]]. Several types of non-metal elements exist only as molecules in the environment. For example, hydrogen only exists as hydrogen molecule. A molecule of a compound is made out of two or more elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hutchinson unabridged encyclopedia with atlas and weather guide|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/hutchinson-unabridged-encyclopedia-with-atlas-and-weather-guide/oclc/696918830|website=worldcat.org|publisher=Oxford, England|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Covalent bonding}}
[[File:Covalent bond hydrogen.svg|thumb|right|A covalent bond forming H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (right) where two [[hydrogen atom]]s share the two electrons]]
A covalent bond is a [[chemical bond]] that involves the sharing of [[electron pair]]s between [[atom]]s. These electron pairs are termed ''shared pairs'' or ''bonding pairs'', and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is termed ''covalent bonding''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author2= Brad Williamson; Robin J. Heyden| last= Campbell| first= Neil A.| title= Biology: Exploring Life| url= http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html| accessdate= 2012-02-05| year= 2006| publisher= [[Pearson Prentice Hall]]| location= Boston, Massachusetts| isbn= 0-13-250882-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ionic ===
{{main|Ionic bonding}} [[File:NaF.gif|thumb|left|[[Sodium]] and [[fluorine]] undergoing a redox reaction to form [[sodium fluoride]]. Sodium loses its outer [[electron]]  to give it a stable [[electron configuration]], and this electron enters the fluorine atom [[exothermic]]ally.]]

Ionic bonding is a type of [[chemical bond]] that involves the [[electrostatic]] attraction between oppositely charged [[ion]]s, and is the primary interaction occurring in [[ionic compound]]s. The ions are atoms that have lost one or more [[electron]]s (termed [[cation]]s) and atoms that have gained one or more electrons (termed [[anion]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VdROgeQ5M8C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=ionic+bonding+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi34bOG_6nTAhVnl1QKHRLZBeoQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=ionic%20bonding%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false|title=Elements of Metallurgy and Engineering Alloys|last=Campbell|first=Flake C.|date=2008-01-01|publisher=[[ASM International]]|isbn=9781615030583|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transfer of electrons is termed ''electrovalence'' in contrast to [[covalent bond|covalence]]. In the simplest case, the cation is a [[metal]] atom and the anion is a [[nonmetal]] atom, but these ions can be of a more complicated nature, e.g. molecular ions like NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. Basically, an ionic bond is the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal for both atoms to obtain a full valence shell.

== Molecular size ==

Most molecules are far too small to be seen with the naked eye, but there are exceptions. [[DNA]], a [[macromolecule]], can reach [[macroscopic]] sizes, as can molecules of many [[polymer]]s. Molecules commonly used as building blocks for organic synthesis have a dimension of a few [[angstrom]]s (Å) to several dozen Å, or around one billionth of a meter. Single molecules cannot usually be observed by [[light]] (as noted above), but small molecules and even the outlines of individual atoms may be traced in some circumstances by use of an [[atomic force microscope]]. Some of the largest molecules are [[macromolecule]]s or [[supermolecule]]s.

The smallest molecule is the [[diatomic]] [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), with a bond length of 0.74 Å.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Roger L. DeKock |author2=Harry B.

== Molecular formulas ==

=== Chemical formula types ===
{{Main|Chemical formula}}

The [[chemical formula]] for a molecule uses one line of [[chemical element]] symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, and ''plus'' (+) and ''minus'' (−) signs. These are limited to one typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and superscripts.

A compound's [[empirical formula]] is a very simple type of chemical formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wUmteTIc18C&amp;pg=PA288&amp;dq=empirical+formula&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiv64bBh6rTAhUSwmMKHb3vB0IQ6AEIOjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=empirical%20formula&amp;f=false|title=The Practice of Chemistry|last=Wink|first=Donald J.|last2=Fetzer-Gislason|first2=Sharon|last3=McNicholas|first3=Sheila|date=2003-03-01|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780716748717|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the simplest [[integer]] [[ratio]] of the [[chemical element]]s that constitute it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chemteam.info/Mole/EmpiricalFormula.html|title=ChemTeam: Empirical Formula|website=www.chemteam.info|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, water is always composed of a 2:1 ratio of [[hydrogen]] to [[oxygen]] atoms, and ethyl [[alcohol]] or [[ethanol]] is always composed of [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], and [[oxygen]] in a 2:6:1 ratio. However, this does not determine the kind of molecule uniquely&amp;nbsp;– [[dimethyl ether]] has the same ratios as ethanol, for instance. Molecules with the same [[atom]]s in different arrangements are called [[isomer]]s. Also carbohydrates, for example, have the same ratio (carbon:hydrogen:oxygen= 1:2:1) (and thus the same empirical formula) but different total numbers of atoms in the molecule.

The [[molecular formula]] reflects the exact number of atoms that compose the molecule and so characterizes different molecules. However different isomers can have the same atomic composition while being different molecules.

The empirical formula is often the same as the molecular formula but not always. For example, the molecule [[acetylene]] has molecular formula C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but the simplest integer ratio of elements is CH.

The [[molecular mass]] can be calculated from the [[chemical formula]] and is expressed in conventional [[atomic mass unit]]s equal to 1/12 of the mass of a neutral carbon-12 (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;[[carbon|C]] [[isotope]]) atom. For [[network solid]]s, the term [[formula unit]] is used in [[stoichiometric]] calculations.

[[File:Atisane3.png|thumb|right|upright=1.8|[[Three-dimensional space|3D]] (left and center) and [[2D geometric model|2D]] (right) representations of the [[terpenoid]] molecule atisane]]

For molecules with a complicated 3-dimensional structure, especially involving atoms bonded to four different substituents, a simple molecular formula or even semi-structural [[chemical formula]] may not be enough to completely specify the molecule. In this case, a graphical type of formula called a [[structural formula]] may be needed. Structural formulas may in turn be represented with a one-dimensional chemical name, but such [[chemical nomenclature]] requires many words and terms which are not part of chemical formulas.

== Molecular geometry ==
{{Main|Molecular geometry}}

[[File:Cyanostar STM.png|thumb|left|upright|Structure and [[Scanning tunneling microscopy|STM]] image of a "cyanostar" [[dendrimer]] molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/C4CC03725A|pmid=25080328|title=Anion-induced dimerization of 5-fold symmetric cyanostars in 3D crystalline solids and 2D self-assembled crystals|journal=Chemical Communications|volume=50|issue=69|pages=9827–30|year=2014|last1=Hirsch|first1=Brandon E.|last2=Lee|first2=Semin|last3=Qiao|first3=Bo|last4=Chen|first4=Chun-Hsing|last5=McDonald|first5=Kevin P.|last6=Tait|first6=Steven L.|last7=Flood|first7=Amar H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Molecules have fixed [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] geometries—bond lengths and angles— about which they continuously oscillate through vibrational and rotational motions. A pure substance is composed of molecules with the same average geometrical structure. The chemical formula and the structure of a molecule are the two important factors that determine its properties, particularly its [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]. [[Isomers]] share a chemical formula but normally have very different properties because of their different structures. [[Stereoisomer]]s, a particular type of isomer, may have very similar physico-chemical properties and at the same time different [[biochemistry|biochemical]] activities.

== Molecular spectroscopy ==
{{Main|Spectroscopy}}

[[File:Dehydrogenation of H2TPP by STM.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Hydrogen can be removed from individual [[Tetraphenylporphyrin|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP]] molecules by applying excess voltage to the tip of a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM, a); this removal alters the current-voltage (I-V) curves of TPP molecules, measured using the same STM tip, from [[diode]] like (red curve in b) to [[resistor]] like (green curve). Image (c) shows a row of TPP, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP and TPP molecules. While scanning image (d), excess voltage was applied to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP at the black dot, which instantly removed hydrogen, as shown in the bottom part of (d) and in the rescan image (e). Such manipulations can be used in [[single-molecule electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/srep08350|pmid=25666850|pmc=4322354|title=N and p type character of single molecule diodes|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|page=8350|year=2015|bibcode= 2015NatSR...5E8350Z|author1=Zoldan|first1=V. C.|last2=Faccio|first2=R|last3=Pasa|first3=A. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Molecular spectroscopy''' deals with the response ([[frequency spectrum|spectrum]]) of molecules interacting with probing signals of known [[energy]] (or [[frequency]], according to [[Planck's constant|Planck's formula]]). Molecules have quantized energy levels that can be analyzed by detecting the molecule's energy exchange through [[absorbance]] or [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]].&lt;ref name="iupac2"&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Spectroscopy|file=S05848|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Spectroscopy does not generally refer to [[diffraction]] studies where particles such as [[neutron]]s, [[electron]]s, or high energy [[X-ray]]s interact with a regular arrangement of molecules (as in a crystal).

[[Microwave spectroscopy]] commonly measures changes in the rotation of molecules, and can be used to identify molecules in outer space. [[Infrared spectroscopy]] measures changes in vibration of molecules, including stretching, bending or twisting motions. It is commonly used to identify the kinds of bonds or [[functional group]]s in molecules. Changes in the arrangements of electrons yield absorption or emission lines in ultraviolet, visible or [[near infrared]] light, and result in colour. Nuclear resonance spectroscopy actually measures the environment of particular nuclei in the molecule, and can be used to characterise the numbers of atoms in different positions in a molecule.

== Theoretical aspects ==

The study of molecules by [[molecular physics]] and [[theoretical chemistry]] is largely based on [[quantum mechanic]]s and is essential for the understanding of the [[chemical bond]]. The simplest of molecules is the [[hydrogen molecule-ion]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the [[one-electron bond]]. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is composed of two positively charged [[proton]]s and one negatively charged [[electron]], which means that the [[Schrödinger equation]] for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron–electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of [[computational chemistry]].

When trying to define rigorously whether an arrangement of atoms is ''sufficiently stable'' to be considered a molecule, IUPAC suggests that it "must correspond to a depression on the [[potential energy surface]] that is deep enough to confine at least one vibrational state".&lt;ref name="iupac" /&gt; This definition does not depend on the nature of the interaction between the atoms, but only on the strength of the interaction. In fact, it includes weakly bound species that would not traditionally be considered molecules, such as the [[helium]] [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]], [[helium dimer|He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], which has one vibrational [[bound state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anderson JB |title=Comment on "An exact quantum Monte Carlo calculation of the helium-helium intermolecular potential" [J. Chem. Phys. 115, 4546 (2001)] |journal=J Chem Phys |volume=120 |issue=20 |pages=9886–7 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15268005 |doi=10.1063/1.1704638 |bibcode= 2004JChPh.120.9886A}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is so loosely bound that it is only likely to be observed at very low temperatures.

Whether or not an arrangement of atoms is ''sufficiently stable'' to be considered a molecule is inherently an operational definition. Philosophically, therefore, a molecule is not a fundamental entity (in contrast, for instance, to an [[elementary particle]]); rather, the concept of a molecule is the chemist's way of making a useful statement about the strengths of atomic-scale interactions in the world that we observe.

'''National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day''' was created by the [[Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association]] to help raise awareness of fuel cell and hydrogen technologies and to celebrate how far the industry has come as well as the vast potential the technologies have today and in future. 

October 8th (10.08) was chosen in reference to the atomic weight of hydrogen (1.008).

National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day was officially launched on October 8, 2015.

'''Nature''', in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or [[universe]]. "Nature" can refer to the [[phenomenon|phenomena]] of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of [[science]]. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.

The word ''nature'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''natura'', or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".&lt;ref name="etymonline-nature"&gt;{{OEtymD|nature|accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Natura'' is a Latin translation of the Greek word ''[[physis]]'' (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.&lt;ref&gt;An account of the pre-Socratic use of the concept of φύσις may be found in Naddaf, Gerard (2006) ''The Greek Concept of Nature'', SUNY Press. The word φύσις, while first used in connection with a plant in Homer, occurs very early in Greek philosophy, and in several senses. Generally, these senses match rather well the current senses in which the English word ''nature'' is used, as confirmed by Guthrie, W.K.C. ''Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'' (volume 2 of his ''History of Greek Philosophy''), Cambridge UP, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first known use of ''physis'' was by [[Homer]] in reference to the intrinsic qualities of a plant: ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι '''φύσιν''' αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε. (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its '''nature'''.) ''[[Odyssey]]'' 10.302–3 (ed. A.T. Murray). (The word is dealt with thoroughly in Liddell and Scott's ''[http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/pollux Greek Lexicon]''.) For later but still very early Greek uses of the term, see earlier note.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of nature as a whole, the physical [[universe]], is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] philosophers, and has steadily gained currency ever since. This usage continued during the advent of modern [[scientific method]] in the last several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton's [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] (1687), for example, is translated "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", and reflects the then-current use of the words "[[natural philosophy]]", akin to "systematic study of nature"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The etymology of the word "physical" shows its use as a synonym for "natural" in about the mid-15th century: {{OEtymD|physical|accessdate=September 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and [[wildlife]]. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the [[Earth]]. It is often taken to mean the "[[natural environment]]" or [[wilderness]]—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human [[consciousness]] or a human [[mind]]. Depending on the particular context, the term "natural" might also be distinguished from the [[Wikt:unnatural|unnatural]] or the [[supernatural]].

Earth is the only [[planet]] known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the [[solar system]], it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest [[terrestrial planet]] and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow [[temperate]] zones, and a wide [[equator]]ial tropical to [[subtropical]] region.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions. The [[Crust (geology)|outer surface]] is divided into several gradually migrating [[tectonic plate]]s. The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and an iron-filled core that generates a [[magnetic field]]. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.

===Geology===
{{Main|Geology}}
Geology is the science and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the [[Earth]]. The field of geology encompasses the study of the composition, [[structural geology|structure]], [[Physical property|physical properties]], dynamics, and [[History of the Earth|history]] of [[Earth materials]], and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major [[academic discipline]], and is also important for [[mining|mineral]] and [[petroleum geology|hydrocarbon]] extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of [[natural hazard]]s, some [[Geotechnical engineering]] fields, and understanding [[Paleoclimatology|past climates]] and environments.

====Geological evolution====
[[File:Tectonic plate boundaries.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Three types of geological [[plate tectonic]] boundaries.]]
The geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.

Rock units are first emplaced either by [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] onto the surface or intrude into the [[Country rock (geology)|overlying rock]]. Deposition can occur when [[sediment]]s settle onto the surface of the Earth and later [[lithification|lithify]] into [[sedimentary rock]], or when as [[volcanic rock|volcanic material]] such as [[volcanic ash]] or [[lava]] flows, blanket the surface. Igneous [[intrusion]]s such as [[batholith]]s, [[laccolith]]s, [[dike (geology)|dikes]], and [[sill (geology)|sills]], push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.

After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be [[deformation (mechanics)|deformed]] and/or [[metamorphism|metamorphosed]]. Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, [[extension (geology)|horizontal extension]], or side-to-side ([[strike-slip]]) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to [[convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], [[divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], and [[transform boundary|transform boundaries]], respectively, between [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]].

Continents formed, then broke up and reformed as the surface of Earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years, occasionally combining to make a [[supercontinent]]. Roughly 750&amp;nbsp;million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent [[Rodinia]], began to break apart.

During the [[Neoproterozoic]] era, freezing temperatures covered much of the Earth in [[glacier]]s and ice sheets. This hypothesis has been termed the "[[Snowball Earth]]", and it is of particular interest as it precedes the [[Cambrian explosion]] in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530–540&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J.L. |last=Kirschvink |date=1992 |chapter=Late Proterozoic Low-Latitude Global Glaciation: The Snowball Earth |chapterurl=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~jkirschvink/pdfs/firstsnowball.pdf |title=The Proterozoic Biosphere |editor=J.W.

Several million years ago, a species of small African [[ape]] gained the ability to stand upright.&lt;ref name="Margulis1995" /&gt; The subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further [[civilization]] allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate. By comparison, the [[Great Oxygenation Event]], produced by the proliferation of [[algae]] during the [[Siderian]] period, required about 300&amp;nbsp;million years to culminate.

==Atmosphere, climate, and weather==
[[File:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|[[Rayleigh scattering|Blue light is scattered more]] than other wavelengths by the gases in the [[atmosphere]], giving the Earth a blue [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]] when seen from space]]
{{Main|Atmosphere of Earth|Climate|Weather}}
The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the [[Nature#Ecosystems|ecosystem]]. The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity. Air is mostly [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[water vapor]], with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude. The [[ozone layer]] plays an important role in depleting the amount of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As [[DNA]] is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.

Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the [[troposphere|lower part of the atmosphere]], and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AJ4SnHbb-ZcC&amp;pg=PA42|title=Environmental Science: Problems, Connections and Solutions|last=Miller|first=G.|last2=Spoolman|first2=Scott|date=September 28, 2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0495383376}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ocean current]]s are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater [[thermohaline circulation]] which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the [[polar region]]s much colder.
[[File:Lightnings sequence 2 animation-wcag.gif|thumb|left|[[Lightning]]]]
Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Extremes in weather, such as [[tornado]]es or [[hurricane]]s and [[cyclone]]s, can expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce devastation. Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food.

Climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather. Various factors are known to [[Climate change|influence the climate]], including ocean currents, surface [[albedo]], [[greenhouse gas]]es, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit. Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including [[ice age]]s.
[[File:Dszpics1.jpg|thumb|A tornado in central [[Oklahoma]]]]
The climate of a region depends on a number of factors, especially [[latitude]]. A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions, ranging from the [[tropical climate]] at the equator to the [[polar climate]] in the northern and southern extremes. Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the [[Earth]]'s [[axis of rotation|axis]] being [[axial tilt|tilted]] relative to its [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]. Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the [[sun]]. This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the [[northern hemisphere|northern]] and [[southern hemisphere|southern]] hemispheres experience opposite seasons.

Weather is a [[Chaos theory|chaotic system]] that is readily modified by small changes to the [[Natural environment|environment]], so accurate [[Meteorology|weather forecasting]] is limited to only a few days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stern|first=Harvey|last2=Davidson|first2=Noel|date=May 25, 2015|title=Trends in the skill of weather prediction at lead times of 1–14 days|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|volume=141|issue=692|pages=2726–36|via=Wiley|doi=10.1002/qj.2559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, two things are happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tropical Ocean Warming Drives Recent Northern Hemisphere Climate Change|publisher=Science Daily|date=April 6, 2001|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/04/010406073554.htm|accessdate=May 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water''' is a [[chemical substance]] that is composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] and is vital for all known forms of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/background.html |title=Water for Life |publisher=Un.org |date=March 22, 2005 |accessdate=May 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In typical usage, ''water'' refers only to its liquid form or [[States of matter|state]], but the substance also has a solid state, [[ice]], and a [[gas]]eous state, [[water vapor]], or [[steam]]. &lt;!--About 1.460 [[Tonne#Multiples|petatonnes]]&amp;nbsp;(Pt) (10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kilograms) of water--&gt;Water covers 71% of the [[Earth]]'s surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html#Geo|title=World|work=CIA – World Fact Book|accessdate=December 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies of water, with 1.6% of water below ground in [[aquifer]]s and 0.001% in the [[atmosphere|air]] as [[vapor]], clouds, and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070320034158/http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html Water Vapor in the Climate System], Special Report, American Geophysical Union, December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080220070111/http://www.unep.org/dewa/assessments/ecosystems/water/vitalwater/ Vital Water]. [[UNEP]].&lt;/ref&gt; Oceans hold 97% of surface water, [[glacier]]s, and polar [[ice cap]]s 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.

===Oceans===
[[File:Ocean from Leblon.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the Atlantic Ocean from [[Leblon]], Rio de Janeiro.]]
{{Main|Ocean}}
An ocean is a major body of [[Seawater|saline water]], and a principal component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a [[World Ocean|continuous body of water]] that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. More than half of this area is over {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} deep. Average oceanic [[salinity]] is around 35 [[parts per thousand]] (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the [[World Ocean]] or global ocean.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.answers.com/Ocean#Encyclopedia Ocean]". ''The Columbia Encyclopedia.'' 2002. New York: Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNAoO"&gt;"[http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html Distribution of land and water on the planet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531103749/http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html |date=May 31, 2008 }}". [http://www.oceansatlas.com/ UN Atlas of the Oceans]&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of a global ocean as a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to [[oceanography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spilhaus | first1 = Athelstan F | year = 1942 | title = Maps of the whole world ocean | url = | journal = Geographical Review | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 431–35 | doi=10.2307/210385| jstor = 210385 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the [[continent]]s, various [[archipelago]]s, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the [[Southern Ocean]], and the Arctic Ocean. Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, [[Headlands and bays|gulfs]], [[bay]]s and other names. There are also [[salt lake]]s, which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the World Ocean. Two notable examples of salt lakes are the [[Aral Sea]] and the [[Great Salt Lake]].

===Lakes===
[[File:Lake mapourika NZ.jpeg|thumb|[[Lake Mapourika]], New Zealand]]
{{Main|Lake}}
A lake (from Latin ''lacus'') is a [[terrain feature]] (or [[physical feature]]), a body of liquid on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of [[Depression (geology)|basin]] (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/328083/lake

|accessdate=June 25, 2008
|title=Lake (physical feature)
|quote=[a Lake is] any relatively large body of slowly moving or standing water that occupies an inland basin of appreciable size. Definitions that precisely distinguish lakes, ponds, swamps, and even rivers and other bodies of nonoceanic water are not well established. It may be said, however, that rivers and streams are relatively fast moving; marshes and swamps contain relatively large quantities of grasses, trees, or shrubs; and ponds are relatively small in comparison to lakes. Geologically defined, lakes are temporary bodies of water.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lake Definition|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/lake|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of [[ethane]], most likely mixed with [[methane]]. It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, [[rift zone]]s, and areas with ongoing or recent [[glacier|glaciation]]. Other lakes are found in [[endorheic basin]]s or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last [[Ice Age]]. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.

====Ponds====
[[File:Mill Pond Sunset.jpg|thumb|The Westborough Reservoir (Mill Pond) in [[Westborough, Massachusetts]].]]
{{Main|Pond}}
A '''pond''' is a [[body of water|body]] of [[Water stagnation|standing water]], either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including [[water garden]]s designed for aesthetic ornamentation, [[fish pond]]s designed for commercial fish breeding, and [[solar pond]]s designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via [[current (stream)|current]] speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as [[stream pool]]s and [[tide pool]]s.

===Rivers===
[[File:View from Cairo Tower 31march2007.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Nile]] river in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]'s capital city]]
{{Main|River}}
A river is a natural [[watercourse]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/river River {definition}] from Merriam-Webster. Accessed February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; usually [[freshwater]], flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is ''Burn'' in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/faqs.htm USGS – U.S. Geological Survey – FAQs], No. 17 What is the difference between mountain, hill, and [[Summit (topography)|peak]]; lake and pond; or river and [[stream|creek]]?&lt;/ref&gt; A river is part of the [[hydrological cycle]]. Water within a river is generally collected from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] through [[surface runoff]], [[groundwater]] recharge, [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]], and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from [[glacier]]s).

===Streams===
[[File:Hawaii Creek.jpg|thumb|A rocky stream in [[Hawaii]]]]
{{Main|Stream}}
A stream is a flowing body of water with a [[Current (stream)|current]], confined within a [[stream bed|bed]] and [[stream bank]]s. In the United States, a stream is classified as a watercourse less than {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=off}} wide. Streams are important as conduits in the [[water cycle]], instruments in [[groundwater recharge]], and they serve as corridors for fish and [[wildlife]] migration. The biological [[habitat]] in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a [[riparian zone]]. Given the status of the ongoing [[Holocene extinction]], streams play an important [[wildlife corridor|corridor]] role in connecting [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitats]] and thus in conserving [[biodiversity]]. The study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology|fluvial geomorphology]], [[aquatic ecology]], [[Freshwater fish|fish biology]], [[riparian|riparian ecology]], and others.

Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, stated: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms (ie: the "community") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem."&lt;ref name="Odum1971"&gt;Odum, EP (1971) ''Fundamentals of ecology'', 3rd edition, Saunders New York&lt;/ref&gt; Within the ecosystem, species are connected and dependent upon one another in the [[food chain]], and exchange energy and [[matter]] between themselves as well as with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |date=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Organization of Life |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9d.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human ecosystem concept is based on the human/nature [[dichotomy]] and the idea that all species are ecologically dependent on each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their [[biotope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s5oRDUuMSIC&amp;pg=PA237|title=Biotechnology Fundamentals|last=Khan|first=Firdos Alam|date=2011-09-20|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1439820094|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A smaller unit of size is called a [[microecosystem]]. For example, a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it. A ''macroecosystem'' might involve a whole [[ecoregion]], with its [[drainage basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey |first=Robert G. |date=April 2004 |title=Identifying Ecoregion Boundaries |journal=Environmental Management |volume=34 |pmid=15883869 |issue=Supplement 1 |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/news_info/Identifying_ecoregion_boundaries.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1007/s00267-003-0163-6 |pages=S14–26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lleZy8MU?url=http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/news_info/Identifying_ecoregion_boundaries.pdf |archivedate=December 4, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilderness===

{{Main|Wilderness}}
'''Wilderness''' is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity. Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, [[:Category:national forests|national forests]], [[national park]]s, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas. Wilderness areas and protected [[parks]] are considered important for the survival of certain [[species]], ecological studies, [[Habitat conservation|conservation]], and solitude. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity,&lt;ref name="Man p155-157"&gt;Botkin, Daniel B. (2000) ''No Man's Garden'', Island Press, pp. 155–57, {{ISBN|1559634650}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the Earth's self-sustaining natural [[ecosystem]] (the [[biosphere]]). They may also preserve historic [[genetics|genetic]] traits and that they provide [[habitat]] for wild [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] that may be difficult or impossible to recreate in [[zoo]]s, [[arboretum]]s, or [[laboratory|laboratories]].

==Life==
{{Life timeline}}
[[File:Malards in Golden Gate Park.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Female mallard and ducklings – [[reproduction]] is essential for continuing life]]
{{Main|Life|Biology|Biosphere}}
Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by [[Organism|organization]], [[metabolism]], [[cell growth|growth]], [[adaptation]], response to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], and [[reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2006 |url=http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |title=Definition of Life |publisher=California Academy of Sciences |accessdate=January 7, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208220940/http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |archivedate=February 8, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of [[organism]]s.

Properties common to terrestrial organisms (plants, animals, [[Fungus|fungi]], [[protist]]s, [[archaea]], and bacteria) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with these properties is generally considered life. However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential. Human-made [[Artificial life|analogs of life]] may also be considered to be life.

The [[biosphere]] is the part of Earth's outer shell&amp;nbsp;– including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere&amp;nbsp;– within which life occurs, and which [[Biology|biotic]] processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest [[Geophysiology|geophysiological]] point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the [[lithosphere]] (rocks), [[hydrosphere]] (water), and [[atmosphere]] (air). The entire Earth contains over 75&amp;nbsp;billion tons (150 ''trillion'' pounds or about 6.8×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kilograms) of [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.&lt;ref&gt;The figure "about one-half of one percent" takes into account the following (See, e.g., {{cite book |last=Leckie |first=Stephen |date=1999 |chapter=How Meat-centred Eating Patterns Affect Food Security and the Environment |chapterurl=http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-30610-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |title=For hunger-proof cities: sustainable urban food systems |publisher=International Development Research Centre |location=Ottawa |isbn=978-0889368828 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113020336/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-30610-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html }}, which takes global average weight as 60&amp;nbsp;kg.), the total human biomass is the average weight multiplied by the current human population of approximately 6.5&amp;nbsp;billion (see, ''e.g.'', {{cite web |title=World Population Information |url=https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/world.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau }}): Assuming 60–70&amp;nbsp;kg to be the average human mass (approximately 130–150&amp;nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]] on the average), an approximation of total global human mass of between 390&amp;nbsp;billion (390×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) and 455&amp;nbsp;billion kg (between 845&amp;nbsp;billion and 975&amp;nbsp;billion lb, or about 423&amp;nbsp;million–488&amp;nbsp;million [[short ton]]s). The total biomass of all kinds on earth is estimated to be in excess of 6.8&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg (75&amp;nbsp;billion short tons). By these calculations, the portion of total biomass accounted for by humans would be very roughly 0.6%.&lt;/ref&gt;

Species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct. However, the [[fossil]] record retains evidence of many of these older species.

===Plants and animals===
{{Main|Plant|Animal}}
[[File:Diversity of plants image version 5.png|thumb|left|A selection of diverse [[plant species]]]]
[[File:Animal diversity.png|thumb|A selection of diverse [[animal species]]]]
Originally [[Aristotle]] divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals. In [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]' system, these became the [[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] [[Vegetabilia]] (later [[Plantae]]) and [[Animal]]ia. Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the [[fungus|fungi]] and several groups of [[alga]]e were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=flora |url=http://webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=flora |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=September 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1998 |title=Status and Trends of the Nation's Biological Resources |chapter=Glossary |chapterurl=http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/zy198.htm |publisher=Department of the Interior, Geological Survey |location=Reston, VA |id=SuDocs No. I 19.202:ST 1/V.1-2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715060359/http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/zy198.htm |archivedate=July 15, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some classifications use the term ''bacterial flora'' separately from ''plant flora''.

Among the many ways of classifying plants are by regional [[flora]]s, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include ''fossil flora'', remnants&lt;br&gt; of plant life from a previous era. People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and [[terrain]].

Regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as ''native flora'' and ''agricultural and garden flora'', the lastly mentioned of which are intentionally grown and cultivated. Some types of "native flora" actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another, and become an integral part of the native, or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced. This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature.

Another category of plant has historically been carved out for ''weeds''. Though the term has fallen into disfavor among [[botanist]]s as a formal way to categorize "useless" plants, the informal use of the word "weeds" to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature. Similarly, animals are often categorized in ways such as ''domestic'', ''farm animals'', ''wild animals'', ''pests'', etc. according to their relationship to human life.

Animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] and usually [[multicellular]] (although see [[Myxozoa]]), which separates them from bacteria, [[archaea]], and most [[protist]]s. They are [[heterotroph]]ic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and [[alga]]e. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and [[fungus|fungi]] by lacking [[cell wall]]s.

With a few exceptions—most notably the two [[Phylum|phyla]] consisting of [[sponge]]s and [[placozoa]]ns—animals have bodies that are differentiated into [[biological tissue|tissues]]. These include [[muscle]]s, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a [[nervous system]], which sends and processes signals. There is also typically an internal [[digestion|digestive]] chamber. The eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of [[collagen]] and elastic [[glycoprotein]]s. This may be calcified to form structures like [[Animal shell|shells]], [[bone]]s, and [[spicule (sponge)|spicules]], a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation, and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility.

Although humans comprise only a minuscule proportion of the total living biomass on Earth, the human effect on nature is disproportionately large. Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and "made environments" is not clear cut except at the extremes. Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace.

The development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards. In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human [[civilization]] remains closely linked to changes in the environment. There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Feedback Loops in Global Climate Change Point to a Very Hot 21st Century|publisher=Science Daily|date=May 22, 2006|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/ESD-feedback-loops.html|accessdate=January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include pollution, [[deforestation]], and disasters such as oil spills. Humans have contributed to the [[extinction]] of many plants and animals.

Humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities. The acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains a sizable component of the world's economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://knoema.com/zscvyje/natural-resources-contribution-to-gdp|title=Natural Resources contribution to GDP|date=November 2014|website=World Development Indicators (WDI)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223080408/https://knoema.com/zscvyje/natural-resources-contribution-to-gdp|archive-date=December 23, 2014|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2012.html|title=GDP – Composition by Sector|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|work=[[The World Factbook]]|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some activities, such as hunting and fishing, are used for both sustenance and leisure, often by different people. [[Agriculture#History|Agriculture]] was first adopted around the [[9th millennium BCE]]. Ranging from food production to energy, nature influences economic wealth.

Although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nps.gov/plants/medicinal/plants.htm|title = Plant Conservation Alliance – Medicinal Plant Working Groups Green Medicine|publisher = US National Park Services |accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; most modern human use of plants is through agriculture. The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth has led to a significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Oosthoek|first = Jan|date = 1999|url = http://www.eh-resources.org/philosophy.html|title = Environmental History: Between Science &amp; Philosophy|publisher = Environmental History Resources|accessdate = December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics and beauty===
[[File:504px-Pinguiculagrandiflora1web.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Pinguicula grandiflora]]'', commonly known as a [[Butterwort]]]]
Beauty in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called [[aesthetics]]. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |title=On the Beauty of Nature |publisher=The Wilderness Society |accessdate=September 29, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909220214/http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |archivedate=September 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of [[landscape art]] began in China during the [[Tang Dynasty art|Tang Dynasty]] (618–907). The tradition of representing nature ''as it is'' became one of the aims of [[Chinese painting]] and was a significant influence in Asian art.

Although natural wonders are celebrated in the [[Psalms]] and the [[Book of Job]], [[wilderness]] portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially in the works of the [[Romantic movement]]. [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] artists [[John Constable]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. [[William Wordsworth]]'s poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.spacesfornature.org/greatspaces/conservation.html History of Conservation] BC Spaces for Nature. Accessed: May 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This artistic movement also coincided with the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist movement]] in the Western world. A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word [[mimesis]], the imitation of nature. Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical [[Substantial form|forms]] and more generally by [[patterns in nature]]. As David Rothenburg writes, "The beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art, the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Survival of the Beautiful: Art, Science and Evolution | publisher=Bloomsbury | author=Rothenberg, David |isbn=978-1608192168| date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|281}}

==Matter and energy==

{{Main|Matter|Energy}}
Some fields of science see nature as matter in motion, obeying certain laws of nature which science seeks to understand. For this reason the most fundamental science is generally understood to be "[[physics]]"&amp;nbsp;– the name for which is still recognizable as meaning that it is the study of nature.

Matter is commonly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed. It constitutes the [[observable universe]]. The visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4.9 percent of the total mass. The remainder is believed to consist of 26.8 percent [[cold dark matter]] and 68.3 percent [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name="planck_overview"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Planck 2013 results. I.

The behavior of matter and energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined [[physical law]]s. These laws have been employed to produce [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models that successfully explain the structure and the evolution of the universe we can observe. The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty [[physical constant]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Taylor|first = Barry N.|date = 1971|url = http://www.physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/introduction.html|title = Introduction to the constants for nonexperts|publisher = National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate = January 7, 2007

==Beyond Earth==
[[File:Planets2013.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Planet]]s of the [[Solar System]] ''(Sizes to scale, distances and illumination not to scale)'']]
[[File:NGC 4414 (NASA-med).jpg|thumb|'''[[NGC 4414]]''' is a spiral galaxy in the constellation [[Coma Berenices]] about 56,000 [[light-year]]s in diameter and approximately 60 million light-years from [[Earth]]]]
{{Main|Outer space|Universe|Extraterrestrial life}}
Outer space, also simply called ''space'', refers to the relatively empty regions of the [[universe]] outside the [[atmosphere]]s of celestial bodies. ''Outer'' space is used to distinguish it from [[airspace]] (and terrestrial locations). There is no discrete boundary between the [[Earth's atmosphere]] and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude. Outer space within the [[Solar System]] is called [[interplanetary space]], which passes over into [[interstellar medium|interstellar space]] at what is known as the [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]].

Outer space is sparsely filled with several dozen types of [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[molecule]]s discovered to date by [[rotational spectroscopy|microwave spectroscopy]], [[cosmic microwave background radiation|blackbody radiation]] left over from the [[big bang]] and the origin of the universe, and [[cosmic ray]]s, which include [[ion]]ized [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and various [[subatomic particle]]s. There is also some gas, [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and [[dust]], and small [[meteor]]s. Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this [[space debris|debris]] re-enters the atmosphere periodically.

Although the Earth is the only body within the solar system known to support life, evidence suggests that in the distant past the planet [[Mars]] possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Bibring, J |display-authors=etal|title = Global mineralogical and aqueous mars history derived from OMEGA/Mars Express data|journal = Science|volume = 312|issue = 5772|pages = 400–04|date = 2006|pmid = 16627738|doi = 10.1126/science.1122659|bibcode = 2006Sci...312..400B}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a brief period in Mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life. At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen.
If life exists at all on Mars, it is most likely to be located underground where liquid water can still exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Tariq|last = Malik|date = March 8, 2005|url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7129347/|title = Hunt for Mars life should go underground|publisher = Space.com via msnbc.msn.com |accessdate=September 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions on the other terrestrial planets, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]], appear to be too harsh to support life as we know it. But it has been conjectured that [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], the fourth-largest moon of [[Jupiter]], may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Turner, Scott |date = March 2, 1998|url = http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/news8.html|title = Detailed Images From Europa Point To Slush Below Surface|publisher = NASA |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomers have started to discover extrasolar [[Earth analog]]s – planets that lie in the [[habitable zone]] of space surrounding a [[star]], and therefore could possibly host life as we know it.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Charles Q.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9251">[[File:Romuvan ritual fire.png|thumb|An ''aukuras'', a type of fire altar found in [[Romuva (religion)|Romuva]], a modern Pagan faith characterised as a "nature religion".]]

A '''nature religion''' is a religious movement that believes [[nature]] and the [[Natural environment|natural world]] is an embodiment of divinity, sacredness or spiritual power.&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 11"/&gt; Nature religions include [[indigenous religion]]s [[Nature worship|practiced]] in various parts of the world by cultures who consider the environment to be imbued with spirits and other sacred entities. It also includes [[modern Paganism|contemporary Pagan]] faiths which are primarily concentrated in Europe and North America.

The term "nature religion" was first coined by the American [[religious studies]] scholar [[Catherine Albanese]], who used it in her work ''Nature Religion in America: From the Algonkian Indians to the New Age'' (1991) and later went on to use it in other studies. Following on from Albanese's development of the term it has since been used by other academics working in the discipline.

==Definition==
Catherine Albanese described nature religion as "a symbolic center and the cluster of beliefs, behaviours, and values that encircles it", deeming it to be useful for shining a light on aspects of history that are rarely viewed as religious.{{sfn|Albanese|1991|pp=7&amp;ndash;8}}
In a paper of his on the subject, the Canadian religious studies scholar Peter Beyer described "nature religion" as a "useful analytical abstraction" to refer to "any religious belief or practice in which devotees consider nature to be the embodiment of divinity, sacredness, transcendence, spiritual power, or whatever cognate term one wishes to use".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 11"&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to note that in this way nature religion was not an "identifiable religious tradition" such as [[Buddhism]] or [[Christianity]] are, but that it instead covers "a range of religious and quasi-religious movements, groups and social networks whose participants may or may not identify with one of the many constructed religions of global society which referred to many other nature religion."&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 16"&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

This list could vary somewhat and I certainly do not want to suggest that such classification is an unambiguous matter."

[[File:Amatciems July 2015.jpg|thumb|left|Amatciems, a settlement of [[Ringing Cedars' Anastasians]] in [[Drabeši Parish]], [[Latvia]]. Anastasianism is a Russian-originated modern Pagan movement that sacralises environmental and human nativity (''[[Rod (Slavic religion)|Rod]]''), and is therefore regarded as a "nature religion".]]

===Common characteristics===
Peter Beyer noted the existence of a series of common characteristics which he believed were shared by different nature religions. He remarked that although "one must be careful not to overgeneralise", he suspected that there were a series of features which "occur sufficiently often" in those nature religions known to recorded scholarship to constitute a pattern.&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

The first of these common characteristics was nature religion's "comparative resistance to institutionalisation and legitimisation in terms of identifiable socio-religious authorities and organisations", meaning that nature religionists rarely formed their religious beliefs into large, visible socio-political structures such as churches. Furthermore, Beyer noted, nature religionists often held a "concomitant distrust of and even eschewing of politically orientated power".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt; Instead of this, he felt that among nature religious communities, there was "a valuing of community as non-hierarchical" and a "conditional optimism with regard to human capacity and the future."&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

In the sphere of the environment, Beyer noted that nature religionists held to a "holistic conception of reality" and "a valorisation of physical place as vital aspects of their spiritualities".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt; Similarly, Beyer noted the [[individualism]] which was favoured by nature religionists. He remarked that those adhering to such beliefs typically had respect for "charismatic and hence purely individual authority" and place a "strong emphasis on individual paths" which led them to believe in "the equal value of individuals and groups". Along similar lines, he also commented on the "strong experiential basis" to nature religionist beliefs "where personal experience is a final arbiter of truth or validity".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

==Use within academia==
In April 1996, the [[University of Lancaster]] in North West England held a conference on contemporary Paganism entitled "Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samuel|first=Geoffrey|date=1996-10-01|title=Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s. Conference at the Lake District Campus of Lancaster University, 9th to 13th April 1996|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1006/reli.1996.0031|journal=Religion|volume=26|issue=4|pages=373–376|doi=10.1006/reli.1996.0031|issn=0048-721X}}&lt;/ref&gt;", and ultimately led to the publication of an academic anthology of the same name two years later.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 8"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This book, ''Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World'', was edited by members of the University's Department of Religious Studies, a postgraduate named Joanne Pearson and two professors, Richard H. Roberts and Geoffrey Samuel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his study of [[Wicca]], the [[Pagan studies]] scholar Ethan Doyle White expressed the view that the category of "nature religion" was problematic from a "historical perspective" because it solely emphasises the "commonalities of belief and attitude to the natural world" that are found between different religions and in doing so divorces these different belief systems from their distinctive socio-cultural and historical backgrounds.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=8}}

The '''observable universe''' is a [[celestial sphere|spherical region]] of the [[Universe]] comprising all [[matter]] that can be [[observation|observed]] from [[Earth]] at the present time, because [[electromagnetic radiation]] from these [[astronomical object|objects]] has had time to reach Earth since the beginning of the [[metric expansion of space|cosmological expansion]]. There are at least 2 trillion [[galaxy|galaxies]] in the observable universe.&lt;ref name="Conselice"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Evolution of Galaxy Number Density at ''z'' &lt; 8 and Its Implications |first=Christopher J. |last=Conselice et al |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=830 |issue=2 |year=2016 |arxiv=1607.03909v2 |bibcode= 2016ApJ...830...83C |doi=10.3847/0004-637X/830/2/83 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20161017"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fountain |first=Henry |title=Two Trillion Galaxies, at the Very Least |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/science/two-trillion-galaxies-at-the-very-least.html |date=17 October 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |access-date=17 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the Universe is [[isotropy|isotropic]], the distance to the edge of the observable universe is roughly [[equidistant|the same]] in every direction. That is, the observable universe has a [[sphere|spherical]] volume (a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]]) centered on the observer. Every location in the Universe has its own observable universe, which may or may not overlap with the one [[geocentric model|centered on Earth]].

The word ''observable'' in this sense does not refer to the capability of modern technology to detect [[light]] or other information from an object, or whether there is anything to be detected. It refers to the physical limit created by the [[speed of light]] itself. Because no signals can travel faster than light, any object farther away from us than light could travel in the [[age of the Universe]] (estimated {{as of|2015|lc=y}} around {{val|13.799|0.021|ul=billion}} years&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"/&gt;) simply cannot be detected, as they have not reached us yet. Sometimes astrophysicists distinguish between the ''visible'' universe, which includes only signals emitted since [[Recombination_(cosmology)|recombination]]—and the ''observable'' universe, which includes signals since the beginning of the cosmological expansion (the [[Big Bang cosmology|Big Bang]] in traditional [[physical cosmology]], the end of the [[inflationary epoch]] in modern cosmology).

According to calculations, the current ''[[comoving distance]]''—proper distance, which takes into account that the universe has expanded since the light was emitted—to particles from which the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMBR) was emitted, which represent the radius of the visible universe, is about 14.0 billion [[parsec]]s (about 45.7 billion light-years), while the comoving distance to the edge of the observable universe is about 14.3 billion parsecs (about 46.6 billion light-years),&lt;ref name="mapofuniverse"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Gott III|first = J.

Since the expansion of the universe is known to accelerate and will become exponential in the future, the light emitted from all distant objects, past some time dependent on their current [[redshift]], will never reach the Earth. In the future all currently observable objects will slowly freeze in time while emitting progressively redder and fainter light. For instance, objects with the current redshift ''z'' from 5 to 10 will remain observable for no more than 4–6 billion years. In addition, light emitted by objects currently situated beyond a certain comoving distance (currently about 19 billion parsecs) will never reach Earth.&lt;ref name=Loeb2002&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.65.047301|title=Long-term future of extragalactic astronomy|journal=Physical Review D|volume=65|issue=4|year=2002|last1=Loeb|first1=Abraham|arxiv=astro-ph/0107568|bibcode=2002PhRvD..65d7301L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The universe versus the observable universe ==
{{Physical cosmology|comp/struct}}
Some parts of the universe are too far away for the light emitted since the [[Big Bang]] to have had enough time to reach Earth, and so lie outside the observable universe. In the future, light from distant galaxies will have had more time to travel, so additional regions will become observable. However, due to [[Hubble's law]], regions sufficiently distant from the Earth are expanding away from it faster than the speed of light ([[special relativity]] prevents nearby objects in the same local region from moving faster than the speed of light with respect to each other, but there is no such constraint for distant objects when the space between them is expanding; see [[Comoving and proper distances#Uses of the proper distance|uses of the proper distance]] for a discussion) and furthermore the [[Accelerating expansion of the universe|expansion rate appears to be accelerating]] due to [[dark energy]]. Assuming dark energy remains constant (an unchanging [[cosmological constant]]), so that the expansion rate of the universe continues to accelerate, there is a "future visibility limit" beyond which objects will ''never'' enter our observable universe at any time in the infinite future, because light emitted by objects outside that limit would never reach the Earth. (A subtlety is that, because the [[Hubble's law#Interpretation|Hubble parameter]] is decreasing with time, there can be cases where a galaxy that is receding from the Earth just a bit faster than light does emit a signal that reaches the Earth eventually.&lt;ref name=ly93 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=575 Is the universe expanding faster than the speed of light?] (see the last two paragraphs)&lt;/ref&gt;) This future visibility limit is calculated at a [[comoving distance]] of 19 billion parsecs (62 billion light-years), assuming the universe will keep expanding forever, which implies the number of galaxies that we can ever theoretically observe in the infinite future (leaving aside the issue that some may be impossible to observe in practice due to redshift, as discussed in the following paragraph) is only larger than the number currently observable by a factor of 2.36.&lt;ref name="mapofuniverse2"&gt;The comoving distance of the future visibility limit is calculated on p. 8 of Gott et al.'s [http://www.astro.princeton.edu/universe/ms.pdf A Map of the Universe] to be 4.50 times the [[Hubble radius]], given as 4.220 billion parsecs (13.76 billion light-years), whereas the current comoving radius of the observable universe is calculated on p. 7 to be 3.38 times the Hubble radius. The number of galaxies in a sphere of a given comoving radius is proportional to the cube of the radius, so as shown on p. 8 the ratio between the number of galaxies observable in the future visibility limit to the number of galaxies observable today would be (4.50/3.38)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 2.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though in principle more galaxies will become observable in the future, in practice an increasing number of galaxies will become extremely [[redshift]]ed due to ongoing expansion, so much so that they will seem to disappear from view and become invisible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Krauss|first = Lawrence M.|author2=Robert J.

Science Friday, 3 Apr 2009. According to the [https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=102715275 transcript], [[Brian Greene]] makes the comment "And actually, in the far future, everything we now see, except for our local galaxy and a region of galaxies will have disappeared. The entire universe will disappear before our very eyes, and it's one of my arguments for actually funding cosmology. We've got to do it while we have a chance."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Faster than light#Universal expansion]] and [[Future of an expanding universe#Galaxies outside the Local Supercluster are no longer detectable]].&lt;/ref&gt; An additional subtlety is that a galaxy at a given comoving distance is defined to lie within the "observable universe" if we can receive signals emitted by the galaxy at any age in its past history (say, a signal sent from the galaxy only 500 million years after the Big Bang), but because of the universe's expansion, there may be some later age at which a signal sent from the same galaxy can ''never'' reach the Earth at any point in the infinite future (so, for example, we might never see what the galaxy looked like 10 billion years after the Big Bang),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Loeb|first = Abraham|title = The Long-Term Future of Extragalactic Astronomy|journal = Physical Review D|volume = 65|issue = 4|date = 2002|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.65.047301|arxiv=astro-ph/0107568|bibcode = 2002PhRvD..65d7301L }}&lt;/ref&gt; even though it remains at the same comoving distance (comoving distance is defined to be constant with time—unlike proper distance, which is used to define recession velocity due to the expansion of space), which is less than the comoving radius of the observable universe.{{clarify|date=July 2014}} This fact can be used to define a type of cosmic [[event horizon]] whose distance from the Earth changes over time. For example, the current distance to this horizon is about 16 billion light-years, meaning that a signal from an event happening ''at present'' can eventually reach the Earth in the future if the event is less than 16 billion light-years away, but the signal will never reach the Earth if the event is more than 16 billion light-years away.&lt;ref name=ly93 /&gt;

Both popular and professional research articles in cosmology often use the term "universe" to mean "observable universe".{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} This can be justified on the grounds that we can never know anything by direct experimentation about any part of the universe that is [[Causality (physics)|causally disconnected]] from the Earth, although many credible theories require a total universe much larger than the observable universe.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} No evidence exists to suggest that the boundary of the observable universe constitutes a boundary on the universe as a whole, nor do any of the mainstream cosmological models propose that the universe has any physical boundary in the first place, though some models propose it could be finite but unbounded, like a higher-dimensional analogue of the 2D surface of a sphere that is finite in area but has no edge. It is plausible that the [[galaxy|galaxies]] within our observable universe represent only a minuscule fraction of the galaxies in the universe. According to the theory of [[cosmic inflation]] initially introduced by its founder, [[Alan Guth]] (and by D. Kazanas &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title="Dynamics of the Universe and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking" Kazanas, D., Ap. J. (Lett.), 241, L59-L63.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), if it is assumed that inflation began about 10&lt;sup&gt;−37&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang, then with the plausible assumption that the size of the universe before the inflation occurred was approximately equal to the speed of light times its age, that would suggest that at present the entire universe's size is at least 3×10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; times the radius of the observable universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan H.

If the universe is finite but unbounded, it is also possible that the universe is ''smaller'' than the observable universe. In this case, what we take to be very distant galaxies may actually be duplicate images of nearby galaxies, formed by light that has circumnavigated the universe. It is difficult to test this hypothesis experimentally because different images of a galaxy would show different eras in its history, and consequently might appear quite different.

Many secondary sources have reported a wide variety of incorrect figures for the size of the visible universe. Some of these figures are listed below, with brief descriptions of possible reasons for misconceptions about them.

;13.8 billion light-years
:The [[age of the universe]] is estimated to be 13.8 billion years. While it is commonly understood that nothing can accelerate to velocities equal to or greater than that of light, it is a common misconception that the radius of the observable universe must therefore amount to only 13.8 billion light-years. This reasoning would only make sense if the flat, static [[Minkowski space]]time conception under special relativity were correct. In the real universe, [[spacetime]] is curved in a way that corresponds to the [[Expansion of the universe|expansion of space]], as evidenced by [[Hubble's law]]. Distances obtained as the speed of light multiplied by a cosmological time interval have no direct physical significance.&lt;ref&gt;Ned Wright, [http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/Dltt_is_Dumb.html "Why the Light Travel Time Distance should not be used in Press Releases"].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Redshift survey|Sky surveys]] and mappings of the various [[wavelength]] bands of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (in particular [[Hydrogen line|21-cm emission]]) have yielded much information on the content and character of the [[universe]]'s structure. The organization of structure appears to follow as a [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] model with organization up to the [[scale (spatial)|scale]] of [[supercluster]]s and [[Galaxy filament|filament]]s. Larger than this (at scales between 30 and 200 megaparsecs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLwangEACAAJ|title=An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics|last=Carroll|first=Bradley W.|last2=Ostlie|first2=Dale A.|date=2013-07-23|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9781292022932|edition=International|page=1178|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;), there seems to be no continued structure, a phenomenon that has been referred to as the ''End of Greatness''.&lt;ref name=Kirshner /&gt;

=== Walls, filaments, nodes, and voids ===
[[File:2dfdtfe.gif|thumb|300px|left|[[Dtfe|DTFE reconstruction]] of the inner parts of the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]]]]
The organization of structure arguably begins at the stellar level, though most cosmologists rarely address [[astrophysics]] on that scale. [[Star]]s are organized into [[galaxy|galaxies]], which in turn form [[galaxy group]]s, [[galaxy cluster]]s, [[supercluster]]s, sheets, [[galaxy filament|walls and filaments]], which are separated by immense [[void (astronomy)|voids]], creating a vast foam-like structure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLwangEACAAJ|title=An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics|last=Carroll|first=Bradley W.|last2=Ostlie|first2=Dale A.|date=2013-07-23|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9781292022932|edition=International|pages=1173–1174|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes called the "cosmic web". Prior to 1989, it was commonly assumed that [[virial theorem|virialized]] galaxy clusters were the largest structures in existence, and that they were distributed more or less uniformly throughout the universe in every direction. However, since the early 1980s, more and more structures have been discovered. In 1983, Adrian Webster identified the Webster LQG, a [[large quasar group]] consisting of 5 quasars. The discovery was the first identification of a large-scale structure, and has expanded the information about the known grouping of matter in the universe. In 1987, Robert Brent Tully identified the [[Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex]], the galaxy filament in which the Milky Way resides. It is about 1 billion light-years across. That same year, an unusually large region with a much lower than average distribution of galaxies was discovered, the [[Giant Void]], which measures 1.3 billion light-years across. Based on [[redshift survey]] data, in 1989 [[Margaret Geller]] and [[John Huchra]] discovered the "[[CfA2 Great Wall|Great Wall]]",&lt;ref name="redshift"&gt;{{cite journal |author= M. J. Geller |author2=J. P.

The existence of this structure escaped notice for so long because it requires locating the position of galaxies in three dimensions, which involves combining location information about the galaxies with distance information from [[redshift]]s.
Two years later, astronomers Roger G. Clowes and Luis E. Campusano discovered the [[Clowes–Campusano LQG]], a [[large quasar group]] measuring two billion light-years at its widest point which was the largest known structure in the universe at the time of its announcement. In April 2003, another large-scale structure was discovered, the [[Sloan Great Wall]]. In August 2007, a possible supervoid was detected in the constellation [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12546-biggest-void-in-space-is-1-billion-light-years-across.html Biggest void in space is 1 billion light years across – space – 24 August 2007 – New Scientist].

Retrieved on 2011-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; It coincides with the '[[CMB cold spot]]', a cold region in the microwave sky that is highly improbable under the currently favored cosmological model. This supervoid could cause the cold spot, but to do so it would have to be improbably big, possibly a billion light-years across, almost as big as the Giant Void mentioned above.

Another large-scale structure is the [[SSA22 Protocluster]], a collection of galaxies and enormous gas bubbles that measures about 200 million light-years across.

In 2011, a large quasar group was discovered, [[U1.11]], measuring about 2.5 billion light-years across. On January 11, 2013, another large quasar group, the [[Huge-LQG]], was discovered, which was measured to be four billion light-years across, the largest known structure in the universe at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wall | first = Mike | url = http://www.foxnews.com/science/2013/01/11/largest-structure-in-universe-discovered/ | title = Largest structure in universe discovered | date = 2013-01-11 | publisher = [[Fox News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, astronomers discovered the [[Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall]],&lt;ref name=2014paper&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Horváth |first1=I |last2=Hakkila |first2=Jon |last3=Bagoly |first3=Z. | title = Possible structure in the GRB sky distribution at redshift two | date = 2014 |arxiv=1401.0533 |bibcode=2014A&amp;A...561L..12H |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201323020 |volume=561 |journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |pages=L12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=original&gt;{{cite arXiv |last = Horvath |first = I. |last2= Hakkila |first2=J. |last3=Bagoly |first3=Z. |title = The largest structure of the Universe, defined by Gamma-Ray Bursts |date = 2013 |eprint=1311.1104 |class=astro-ph.CO}}&lt;/ref&gt; an even bigger structure twice as large as the former.

===End of Greatness===
The ''End of Greatness'' is an observational scale discovered at roughly 100&amp;nbsp;[[Megaparsec|Mpc]] (roughly 300 million light-years) where the lumpiness seen in the large-scale structure of the [[universe]] is [[wiktionary:homogeneous|homogenized]] and [[isotropic|isotropized]] in accordance with the [[Cosmological Principle]].&lt;ref name=Kirshner /&gt; At this scale, no pseudo-random [[fractal]]ness is apparent.&lt;ref&gt;LiveScience.com, [https://news.yahoo.com/universe-isnt-fractal-study-finds-215053937.html "The Universe Isn't a Fractal, Study Finds"], Natalie Wolchover,22 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[supercluster]]s and [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] seen in smaller surveys are [[random]]ized to the extent that the smooth distribution of the universe is visually apparent. It was not until the [[redshift survey]]s of the 1990s were completed that this scale could accurately be observed.&lt;ref name=Kirshner&gt;{{cite book |title=The Extravagant Universe: Exploding Stars, Dark Energy and the Accelerating Cosmos |author=Robert P Kirshner |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qQ_mV2prqNYC&amp;pg=PA71 |page=71 |isbn=0-691-05862-8 |date=2002 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observations===
[[File:2MASS LSS chart-NEW Nasa.jpg|right|399px|thumb|"Panoramic view of the entire near-infrared sky reveals the distribution of galaxies beyond the [[Milky Way]]. The image is derived from the [[2MASS|2MASS Extended Source Catalog (XSC)]]—more than 1.5 million galaxies, and the Point Source Catalog (PSC)—nearly 0.5 billion Milky Way stars. The galaxies are color-coded by '[[redshift]]' obtained from the [[Uppsala General Catalogue|UGC]], [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics|CfA]], Tully NBGC, LCRS, [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dF]], 6dFGS, and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]] surveys (and from various observations compiled by the [[NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database|NASA Extragalactic Database]]), or photo-metrically deduced from the [[K band (infrared)|K band]] (2.2 μm).

The map is projected with an equal area Aitoff in the Galactic system (Milky Way at center)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Large Scale Structure in the Local Universe: The 2MASS Galaxy Catalog |last=1Jarrett |first1=T.

Another indicator of large-scale structure is the '[[Lyman-alpha forest]]'. This is a collection of [[Spectral line|absorption lines]] that appear in the spectra of light from [[quasar]]s, which are interpreted as indicating the existence of huge thin sheets of intergalactic (mostly [[hydrogen]]) gas. These sheets appear to be associated with the formation of new galaxies.

Caution is required in describing structures on a cosmic scale because things are often different from how they appear. [[Gravitational lens]]ing (bending of light by gravitation) can make an image appear to originate in a different direction from its real source. This is caused when foreground objects (such as galaxies) curve surrounding spacetime (as predicted by [[general relativity]]), and deflect passing light rays. Rather usefully, strong gravitational lensing can sometimes magnify distant galaxies, making them easier to detect. [[Weak Gravitational Lensing|Weak lensing]] (gravitational shear) by the intervening universe in general also subtly changes the observed large-scale structure. 

The large-scale structure of the universe also looks different if one only uses [[redshift]] to measure distances to galaxies. For example, galaxies behind a galaxy cluster are attracted to it, and so fall towards it, and so are slightly blueshifted (compared to how they would be if there were no cluster) On the near side, things are slightly redshifted. Thus, the environment of the cluster looks a bit squashed if using redshifts to measure distance. An opposite effect works on the galaxies already within a cluster: the galaxies have some random motion around the cluster center, and when these random motions are converted to redshifts, the cluster appears elongated. This creates a "''[[Redshift-space distortions|finger of God]]''"—the illusion of a long chain of galaxies pointed at the Earth.

===Cosmography of Earth's cosmic neighborhood===
At the centre of the [[Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster]], a gravitational anomaly called the [[Great Attractor]] affects the motion of galaxies over a region hundreds of millions of light-years across. These galaxies are all [[redshift]]ed, in accordance with [[Hubble's law]]. This indicates that they are receding from us and from each other, but the variations in their redshift are sufficient to reveal the existence of a concentration of mass equivalent to tens of thousands of galaxies.

The Great Attractor, discovered in 1986, lies at a distance of between 150 million and 250 million light-years (250 million is the most recent estimate), in the direction of the [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] and [[Centaurus]] [[constellation]]s. In its vicinity there is a preponderance of large old galaxies, many of which are colliding with their neighbours, or radiating large amounts of radio waves.

In 1987, [[astronomer]] [[R. Brent Tully]] of the [[University of Hawaii]]'s Institute of Astronomy identified what he called the [[Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex]], a structure one billion [[light-year]]s long and 150 million light-years across in which, he claimed, the Local Supercluster was embedded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/10/science/massive-clusters-of-galaxies-defy-concepts-of-the-universe.html?pagewanted=all Massive Clusters of Galaxies Defy Concepts of the Universe N.Y.

==Mass of ordinary matter==
The mass of the observable universe is often quoted as 10&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt; tonnes or 10&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt; kg.&lt;ref name="Paul Davies 2006 43"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, mass refers to ordinary matter and includes the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) and the [[intergalactic medium]] (IGM). However, it excludes [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]]. This quoted value for the mass of ordinary matter in the universe can be estimated based on critical density. The calculations are for the observable universe only as the volume of the whole is unknown and may be infinite.
===Estimates based on critical density===
Critical density is the energy density for which the universe is flat.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter]].&lt;/ref&gt; If there is no dark energy, it is also the [[density]] for which the expansion of the universe is poised between continued expansion and collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michio Kaku|title=Parallel Worlds| url= https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_4_8?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=parallel+worlds&amp;sprefix=Parallel%2Cstripbooks%2C271| accessdate=1 July 2013 |date=2005|publisher=Anchor Books|isbn=978-1-4000-3372-0|page=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Friedmann equations]], the value for &lt;math&gt;\rho_c&lt;/math&gt; critical density, is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard F. Schutz|title=Gravity from the ground up|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEZNXvYwyNwC&amp;pg=PA361|accessdate=1 May 2011|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-45506-0|pages=361–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_c = \frac{3 H^2}{8 \pi G},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]] and H = ''H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the present value of the [[Hubble constant]]. The current value for ''H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', due to the European Space Agency's Planck Telescope, is ''H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 67.15 kilometers per second per mega parsec. This gives a critical density of {{val|0.85|e=-26|u=kg/m3}} (commonly quoted as about 5 hydrogen atoms per cubic meter). This density includes four significant types of energy/mass: ordinary matter (4.8%), neutrinos (0.1%), [[cold dark matter]] (26.8%), and [[dark energy]] (68.3%).&lt;ref name='planck_cosmological_parameters'&gt;{{cite journal | arxiv=1303.5076 | title=Planck 2013 results.

The density of ordinary matter, as measured by Planck, is 4.8% of the total critical density or {{val|4.08|e=-28|u=kg/m3}}. To convert this density to mass we must multiply by volume, a value based on the radius of the "observable universe". Since the universe has been expanding for 13.8 billion years, the [[Comoving and proper distances|comoving distance]] (radius) is now about 46.6 billion light-years. Thus, volume ({{sfrac|4|3}}''πr''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) equals {{val|3.58|e=80|u=m3}} and the mass of ordinary matter equals density ({{val|4.08|e=-28|u=kg/m3}}) times volume ({{val|3.58|e=80|u=m3}}) or {{val|1.46|e=53|u=kg}}.

Assuming the mass of ordinary matter is about {{val|1.45|e=53|u=kg}} (refer to previous section) and assuming all atoms are [[hydrogen atom]]s (which in reality make up about 74% of all atoms in our galaxy by mass, see [[Abundance of the chemical elements]]), calculating the estimated total number of atoms in the observable universe is straightforward. Divide the mass of ordinary matter by the mass of a hydrogen atom ({{val|1.45|e=53|u=kg}} divided by {{val|1.67|e=-27|u=kg}}). The result is approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt; hydrogen atoms.

==Horizons==
{{Main|List of cosmological horizons}}
The limit of observability in our universe is set by a set of cosmological horizons which limit—based on various physical constraints—the extent to which we can obtain information about various events in the universe. The most famous horizon is the [[particle horizon]] which sets a limit on the precise distance that can be seen due to the finite [[age of the universe]]. Additional horizons are associated with the possible future extent of observations (larger than the particle horizon owing to the [[expansion of space]]), an "optical horizon" at the [[Cosmic microwave background|surface of last scattering]], and associated horizons with the surface of last scattering for [[cosmic neutrino background|neutrinos]] and [[gravitational wave background|gravitational waves]].

'''Open energy system database''' projects employ [[open data]] methods to collect, [[Data cleansing|clean]], and republish energy-related [[dataset]]s for open use.  The resulting information is then available, given a suitable [[open license]], for statistical analysis and for building numerical [[energy system]] [[Energy modeling|models]], including [[open energy system models]].  Permissive licenses like [[Creative Commons]] [[CC0]] and {{nowrap|[[CC BY]]}} are preferred, but some projects will house data made public under market transparency regulations and carrying unqualified [[copyright]].

The databases themselves may furnish information on national power plant fleets, renewable generation assets, transmission networks, [[time series]] for electricity loads, dispatch, [[Spot contract|spot prices]], and cross-border trades, weather information, and similar.  They may also offer other energy statistics including fossil fuel imports and exports, gas, oil, and coal prices, emissions certificate prices, and information on [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] costs and benefits.

Much of the data is sourced from official or semi-official agencies, including [[Official statistics|national statistics offices]], [[transmission system operator]]s, and [[Electricity market|electricity market operators]].  Data is also [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] using public [[wiki]]s and public upload facilities.  Projects usually also maintain a strict record of the [[wiktionary:provenance|provenance]] and version histories of the datasets they hold.  Some projects, as part of their mandate, also try to persuade primary data providers to release their data under more liberal licensing conditions.{{efn|For example, in 2016 the [[#Open Power System Data|Open Power System Data]] project persuaded four German [[transmission system operator]]s to adopt open licensing.&lt;ref name="osi-2016"/&gt;}}

Two drivers favor the establishment of such databases.  The first is a wish to reduce the duplication of effort that accompanies each new analytical project as it assembles and processes the data that it needs from primary sources.  And the second is an increasing desire to make [[public policy]] energy models more transparent to improve their acceptance by policymakers and the public.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Better transparency dictates the use of open information, able to be accessed and scrutinized by third-parties, in addition to releasing the [[source code]] for the models in question.&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"/&gt;

&lt;!-- The projects listed here are deemed suitable for inclusion through having pending or published academic literature or by being reported in secondary sources. --&gt;

== General considerations ==

=== Background ===

In the mid-1990s, energy models used structured text files for data interchange but efforts were being made to migrate to [[relational database management system]]s for data processing.&lt;ref name="groscurth-1995-075bf0"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | first1 = Helmuth-M | last1 = Groscurth
 | date = 1 July 1995
 | title = Design and management of energy databases

 | number = 4
 | pages = 445–457
 | doi = 10.1080/00908319508946093
 | issn = 0090-8312
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  These early efforts however remained local to a project and did not involve online publishing or open data principles.

The first energy information portal to go live was [[#OpenEI|OpenEI]] in late 2009, followed by [[#reegle|reegle]] in 2011.

A 2012 paper marks the first scientific publication to advocate the [[crowdsourcing]] of energy data.&lt;ref name="bazilian-etal-2012"&gt;
{{cite journal

 | access-date = 2016-06-17
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2012 PhD thesis by Chris Davis also discusses the crowdsourcing of energy data in some depth.&lt;ref name="davis-2012"/&gt;  A 2016 thesis surveyed the spatial ([[geographic information system|GIS]]) information requirements for energy planning and finds that most types of data, with the exception of energy expenditure data, are available but nonetheless remain scattered and poorly coordinated.&lt;ref name="berndtsson-2016-msc"&gt;
{{cite thesis

 | access-date = 2017-03-07
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of open data, a 2017 paper concludes that energy research has lagged behind other fields, most notably physics, biotechnology, and medicine.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | last1 = Pfenninger | first1 = Stefan
 | last2 = DeCarolis | first2 = Joseph

 | date = February 2017
 | title = The importance of open data and software: is energy research lagging behind?

 | volume = 101
 | pages = 211–215

 | access-date = 2017-02-03
}} {{open access}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|213–214}}  The paper also lists the benefits of open data and open models and discusses the reasons that many projects nonetheless remain closed.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|211–213}}  A one-page opinion piece from 2017 advances the case for using open energy data and modeling to build public trust in policy analysis.  The article also argues that [[academic journal|scientific journals]] have a responsibility to require that data and code be submitted alongside text for [[peer review]].&lt;ref name="pfenninger-2017"&gt;&lt;!-- alternative url: http://www.nature.com/news/energy-scientists-must-show-their-workings-1.21517 --&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Database design ===

[[Data models]] are central to the design and organization of databases.  Open energy database projects generally try to develop and adhere to well resolved data models, using [[De facto standard|de{{nbsp}}facto]] and [[Technical standard|published standards]] where applicable.  Some projects attempt to coordinate their data models in order to harmonize their data and improve its utility.  Defining and maintaining suitable [[metadata]] is also a key issue.  The [[Information lifecycle management|life-cycle management]] of data includes, but is not limited to, the use of [[version control]] to track the provenance of incoming and [[Data cleansing|cleansed]] data.  Some sites allow users to comment on and rate individual datasets.

=== Dataset copyright and database rights ===

Issues surrounding [[copyright]] remain at the forefront with regard to open energy data.  As noted, most energy datasets are collated and published by official or semi-official sources.  But many of the publicly available energy datasets carry no license, limiting their reuse in numerical and statistical models, open or otherwise.  Copyright protected material cannot lawfully be circulated, nor can it be modified and republished.

{{anchor|ec-regulation-543-2013}}Measures to enforce [[Transparency (market)|market transparency]] have not helped much because the associated information is again not licensed to enable modification and republication.  Transparency measures include the 2013 European energy market transparency regulation 543/2013.&lt;ref name="ec-regulation-543-2013"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | author = European Commission
 | title = Commission Regulation (EU) No 543/2013 of 14 June 2013 on submission and publication of data in electricity markets and amending Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council
 | date = 15 June 2013
 | journal = Official Journal of the European Union
 | volume = L&amp;nbsp;163
 | pages = 1–12
 | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:163:0001:0012:EN:PDF
 | access-date = 2016-12-01
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, 543/2013 "is only an obligation to publish, not an obligation to license".&lt;ref name="boecker-2016"/&gt;{{rp|slide{{nnbsp}}14}}  Notwithstanding, 543/2013 does enable downloaded data to be computer processed with legal certainty.&lt;ref name="jaeger-2017"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

Energy databases with hardware located with the European Union are protected under a general [[Sui generis database right|database law]], irrespective of the legal status of the information they hold.&lt;ref name="boecker-2016"&gt;
{{cite book
 | first1 = Lina | last1 = Boecker
 | date = 21 November 2016
 | title = Energy databases: protection and licensing
 | publisher = JBB Rechtsanwaelte

 | access-date = 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Database rights not waived by public sector providers significantly restrict the amount of data a user can lawfully access.

A December 2017 submission by energy researchers in Germany and elsewhere highlighted a number of concerns over the re-use of public sector information within the Europe Union.&lt;ref name="morrison-etal-2017"&gt;
{{cite book
 | last1 = Morrison | first1 = Robbie
 | last2 = Brown | first2 = Tom
 | last3 = De Felice | first3 = Matteo
 | title = Submission on the re-use of public sector information: with an emphasis on energy system datasets — Release 09
 | date = 10 December 2017
 | location = Berlin, Germany
 | url = https://forum.openmod-initiative.org/uploads/default/original/1X/d659fda325438884e6e78b372772ed7069633f97.pdf
 | access-date = 2017-12-13
}} {{open access}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The submission drew heavily on a recent legal opinion covering electricity data.&lt;ref name="jaeger-2017"&gt;
{{cite book
 | last1 = Jaeger | first1 = Till
 | title = Legal aspects of European electricity data — Legal opinion
 | date = 24 July 2017
 | publisher = JBB Rechtsanwälte
 | location = Berlin, Germany
 | url = https://open-power-system-data.org/legal-opinion.pdf
 | access-date = 2017-10-13
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy statistics ===

National and international energy statistics are published regularly by governments and international agencies, such as the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]].&lt;ref name="iea-2016"&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Key world energy statistics
 | date = 2016
 | publisher = International Energy Agency (IEA)
 | location = Paris, France
 | url = https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2016.pdf
 | access-date = 2016-12-15
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016 the United Nations issued guidelines for energy statistics.&lt;ref name="ires-2016"&gt;&lt;!-- print ISBN: 978-92-1-161584-5 --&gt;
&lt;!-- PDF dated: 23 September 2016  --&gt;
{{cite book|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/energy/ires/IRES_edited2.pdf|title=International Recommendations for Energy Statistics (IRES) — ST/ESA/STAT/SER.M/93|date=2016|publisher=Statistics Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations|isbn=978-92-1-056520-2|location=New York, NY, USA|access-date=2016-12-17}}  Annotated as final edited version prior to typesetting.  Also covers energy-related greenhouse gas emissions accounting.
&lt;/ref&gt;  While the definitions and sectoral breakdowns are useful when defining models, the information provided is rarely in sufficient detail to enable its use in high-resolution energy system models.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|213}}

=== Published standards ===

There are few published standards covering the collection and structuring of high-resolution energy system data.  The [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] [[Common Information Model (electricity)|Common Information Model]] (CIM) defines data exchange protocols for low and high voltage electricity networks.

== Open energy system database projects ==

Energy system models are data intensive and normally require detailed information from a number of sources.  Dedicated projects to collect, collate, document, and republish energy system datasets have arisen to service this need.  Most database projects prefer open data, issued under [[Copyright|free licenses]], but some will accept datasets with proprietary licenses in the absence of other options.

The [[OpenStreetMap]] project, which uses the [[Open Database License]] (ODbL), contains geographic information about energy system components, including transmission lines.  Wikipedia itself has a growing set of information related to national energy systems, including descriptions of individual power stations.&lt;ref name="davis-2012"/&gt;{{rp|156–159}}

The following [[#table-open-energy-system-database-projects|table]] summarizes projects that specifically publish open energy system data.  Some are general repositories while others (for instance, [[#oedb|oedb]]) are designed to interact with open energy system models in real-time.

The energydata.info project from the [[World Bank Group]], [[Washington, DC]], USA is an energy database portal designed to support national development by improving public access to energy information.&lt;ref name="energydata-info-website"&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as sharing data, the platform also offers tools to visualize and analyze energy data.  Although the World Bank Group has made available a number of dataset and apps, external users and organizations are encouraged to contribute.  The concepts of open data and open source development are central to the project.  energydata.info uses its own [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of the [[CKAN]] open source data portal as its web-based platform.  The Creative Commons [[Creative Commons license|CC BY 4.0]] license is preferred for data but other open licenses can be deployed. Users are also bound by the terms of use for the site.&lt;ref name="energydata-info-terms-of-use"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2017|01}}, the database held 131{{nbsp}}datasets, the great majority related to [[Developing country|developing countries]].  The datasets are tagged and can be easily filtered.  A number of download formats, including [[Geographic information system|GIS]] files, are supported: [[Comma-separated values|CSV]], [[Microsoft Excel|XLS]], [[Office Open XML|XLSX]], [[ArcGIS]], [[Esri]], [[GeoJSON]], [[Keyhole Markup Language|KML]], and [[Shapefile|SHP]].  Some datasets are also offered as [[HTML]].  Again, {{as of|lc=yes|2017|01}}, four apps are available.  Some are web-based and run from a browser.

The OpenEnergy Platform (OEP) is a collaborative versioned [[dataset]] repository for storing open energy system model datasets.  A dataset is presumed to be in the form of a [[table (database)|database table]], together with [[metadata]].  Registered users can upload and download datasets manually using a web-interface or programmatically via an [[Application programming interface|API]] using [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] [[POST (HTTP)|POST]] calls.  Uploaded datasets are screened for integrity using deterministic rules and then subject to confirmation by a moderator.  The use of versioning means that any prior state of the database can be accessed (as recommended in this 2012 paper).&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, the repository is specifically designed to interoperate with energy system models.  The [[Front and back ends|backend]] is a [[PostgreSQL]] [[object-relational database]] under [[Apache Subversion|subversion]] [[version control]].  Open source licenses are specific to each dataset.  Unlike other database projects, users can download the current version (the public tables) of the entire [[PostgreSQL]] database or any previous version.  Initial development is being lead by the Reiner Lemoine Institute, [[Berlin]], Germany.

&lt;/ref&gt;  The platform was originally implemented by the [[University of Flensburg]], [[German Institute for Economic Research|DIW Berlin]], the [[Technical University of Berlin]], and the energy economics consultancy Neon Neue Energieökonomik, all from Germany.  The first phase of the project, from August 2015 to July 2017, was funded by the [[Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy]] (BMWi) for {{val|490000|p=€}}.&lt;ref name="fischer-2015"&gt;

Developers collate and harmonize data from a range of government, regulatory, and industry sources throughout Europe.  The website and the metadata utilize English, whereas the original material can be in any one of [[Languages of European Union|24{{nbsp}}languages]].  Datasets follow the emerging [[Comma-separated values#OKI frictionless tabular data package|frictionless data package]] standard being developed by [[Open Knowledge International]] (OKI).  The website was launched on 28{{nbsp}}October 2016.  {{as of|2018|06}}, the project offers the following primary packages, for Germany and other European countries:

* details, including [[geolocation]], of conventional power plants and renewable energy power plants
* aggregated generation capacity by technology and country
* hourly [[time series]] covering electrical load, day-ahead electricity spot prices, and wind and solar resources
* a script to filter and download [[NASA]] MERRA-2 satellite weather data{{efn|name=merra-2|
MERRA-2 stands for Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2.  The [[Remote sensing|remote-sensed]] data is provided unencumbered by the [[NASA]] [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] research laboratory.

In addition, the project hosts selected contributed packages:

* electricity demand and self-generation time series for representative south German households
* simulated [[Photovoltaics|PV]] and wind generation [[capacity factor]] time series for Europe, generated by the [[#Renewables.ninja|Renewables.ninja]] project

To facilitate analysis, the data is aggregated into large structured files (in [[comma-separated values|CSV]] format) and loaded into data packages with standardized machine-readable metadata (in [[JSON]] format).&lt;ref name="oki-data-package"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The same data is usually also provided as [[Office Open XML|XLSX]] ([[Microsoft Excel|Excel]]) and [[SQLite]] files.  The datasets can be accessed in real-time using stable [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]].  The [[Python (programming language)|Python]] scripts deployed for data processing are available on [[GitHub]] and carry an [[MIT license]].  The licensing conditions for the data itself depends on the source and varies in terms of openness.  Previous versions of the datasets and scripts can be recovered in order to track changes or replicate earlier studies.  The project also engages with energy data providers, such as [[transmission system operator]]s (TSO) and [[European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity|ENTSO-E]], to encourage them to make their data available under [[Copyright#Free licences|open licenses]] (for instance, [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons]] and [[Open Database License|ODbL]] licenses).&lt;ref name="osi-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  While much of its data is from US government sources, the platform is intended to be open and global in scope.

OpenEI provides two mechanisms for contributing structured information: a [[semantic wiki]] (using [[MediaWiki]] and the [[Semantic MediaWiki]] extension) for collaboratively-managed resources and a [[dataset]] upload facility for contributor-controlled resources.  US government data is distributed under a [[CC0]] [[public domain]] dedication, whereas other contributors are free to select an open data license of their choice.  Users can rate data using a five-star system, based on accessibility, adaptability, usefulness, and general quality.&lt;ref name="brodt-giles-2012"/&gt;  Individual datasets can be manually downloaded in an appropriate format, often as [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] files.&lt;ref name="brodt-giles-2012"/&gt; [[Scripting language|Scripts]] for processing data can also be shared through the site.  In order to build a community around the platform, a number of [[Internet forum|forums]] are offered covering energy system data and related topics.&lt;ref name="openei-homepage"/&gt;

Most of the data on OpenEI is exposed as [[Linked data#Linked open data|linked open data]] (LOD) (described [[#tag-linked-open-data|elsewhere]] on this page).  OpenEI also uses LOD methods to populate its definitions throughout the wiki with real-time connections to [[DBPedia]], [[#reegle|reegle]], and [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref name="brodt-giles-2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bauer-and-kaltenboeck-2012"&gt;

OpenGridMap employs [[crowdsourcing]] techniques to gather detailed data on electricity network components and then infer a realistic network structure using methods from [[Correlation and dependence|statistics]] and [[graph theory]].  The scope of the project is worldwide and both distribution and transmission networks can be [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]].  The project is managed by the Chair of Business Information Systems, [https://www.in.tum.de/en.html TUM Department of Informatics], [[Technical University of Munich]], [[Munich]], Germany.  The project maintains a website and a [[Facebook]] page and provides an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[mobile app]] to help the public document electrical devices, such as [[transformer]]s and [[Electrical substation|substations]].  The bulk of the data is being made available under a [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons]] {{nowrap|CC BY 3.0 IGO}} license.&lt;ref name="opengridmap-terms-of-use"&gt;

OpenGridMap provides a tailored [[Geographic information system|GIS]] web application, layered on [[OpenStreetMap]], which contributors can use to upload and edit information directly.  The same database automatically stores field recordings submitted by the mobile app.  Subsequent classification by experts allows normal citizens to document and photograph electrical components and have them correctly identified.  The project is experimenting with the use of hobby drones to obtain better information on associated facilities, such as [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] installations.  Transmission line data is also sourced from and shared with OpenStreetMap.  Each component [[Row (database)|record]] is verified by a moderator.

Once sufficient data is available, the transnet software is run to produce a likely network, using [[Correlation and dependence|statistical correlation]], [[Voronoi diagram|Voronoi partitioning]], and [[minimum spanning tree]] (MST) algorithms.  The resulting network can be exported in [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] (separate files for nodes and lines), [[XML]], and [[Common Information Model (electricity)|CIM]] formats.  CIM models are well suited for translation into software-specific data formats for further analysis, including [[Power system simulation|power grid simulation]].  Transnet also displays [[descriptive statistics]] about the resulting network for visual confirmation.&lt;ref name="rivera-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|3–5}}

The project is motivated by the need to provide datasets for high-resolution energy system models, so that energy system transitions (like the German ''[[Energiewende]]'') can be better managed, both technically and policy-wise.&lt;ref name="energate-messenger-2016"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The rapid expansion of [[Renewable energy|renewable generation]] and the anticipated uptake of [[electric vehicle]]s means that electricity system models must increasingly represent distribution and transmission networks in some detail.

{{as of|2017}}, OpenGridMap techniques have been used to estimate the low voltage network in the German city of [[Garching bei München|Garching]] and to estimate the high voltage grids in several other countries.

The project relies on weather data derived from [[meteorological reanalysis]] models and weather [[Meteosat|satellite images]].  More specifically, it uses the 2016 MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset from [[NASA]]{{nnbsp}}{{efn|name=merra-2}} and satellite images from CM-SAF SARAH.&lt;ref name="mueller-etal-2015"&gt;

The website displays an interactive world map to aid the selection of a site.  Users can then choose a plant type and enter some technical characteristics.  {{as of|2017|02}}, only year 2014 data can be served, due to technical restrictions.  The results are automatically plotted and are available for download in hourly [[comma separated values|CSV]] format with or without the associated weather information.  The site offers an [[Application programming interface|API]] for programmatic dataset recovery using token-based authorization.  Examples deploying [[cURL]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] are provided.

A number of studies have been undertaking using the power production datasets underpinning the website (these studies predate the launch of the website), with the bulk focusing on energy options for [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="staffel-and-green-2014"&gt;

'''Outer space''', or just '''space''', is the expanse that exists beyond the [[Earth]] and between [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]]. Outer space is not completely empty—it is a [[hard vacuum]] containing a low density of particles, predominantly a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] as well as [[electromagnetic radiation]], [[magnetic field]]s, [[cosmic neutrino background|neutrinos]], [[cosmic dust|dust]], and [[cosmic ray]]s. The baseline [[temperature]], as set by the [[cosmic background radiation|background radiation]] from the [[Big Bang]], is {{Convert|2.7|K|C F|abbr=out}}.&lt;ref name="CBE2008" /&gt; The [[Warm–hot intergalactic medium|plasma between galaxies]] accounts for about half of the [[baryonic matter|baryonic (ordinary) matter]] in the universe; it has a [[number density]] of less than one [[hydrogen atom]] per [[cubic metre]] and a temperature of millions of kelvins;&lt;ref name=baas41_908/&gt; local concentrations of this plasma have condensed into [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]]. Studies indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form, called [[dark matter]], which interacts with other matter through [[gravitation]]al but not [[electromagnetic force]]s.{{sfn|Freedman|Kaufmann|2005|pp=573, 599–601}}&lt;ref name="Trimble 1987" /&gt; Observations suggest that the majority of the [[Mass–energy equivalence|mass-energy]] in the [[observable universe]] is a poorly understood [[vacuum energy]] of space, which astronomers label ''[[dark energy]]''.&lt;ref name="nasa_darkenergy" /&gt;{{sfn|Freedman|Kaufmann|2005|pp=650–653}} Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the [[Universe]], but even galaxies and [[star system]]s consist almost entirely of empty space.

Outer space does not begin at a definite altitude above the Earth's surface. However, the [[Kármán line]], an altitude of {{Convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} above sea level,{{sfn|O'Leary|2009|p=84}}&lt;ref name=space_begin/&gt; is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping. The framework for international [[space law]] was established by the [[Outer Space Treaty]], which entered into force on 10 October 1967. This treaty precludes any claims of [[national sovereignty]] and permits all states to freely [[space exploration|explore outer space]]. Despite the drafting of [[UN resolution]]s for the peaceful uses of outer space, [[anti-satellite weapon]]s have been tested in Earth orbit.

Humans began the physical exploration of space during the 20th century with the advent of high-altitude [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloon flights]], followed by manned [[rocket launch]]es. [[Earth orbit]] was first achieved by [[Yuri Gagarin]] of the Soviet Union in 1961, and [[unmanned spacecraft]] have since reached all of the known [[planet]]s in the [[Solar System]]. Due to the high cost of getting into space, manned [[spaceflight]] has been limited to low Earth orbit and the [[Moon]].

Outer space represents a challenging environment for human exploration because of the hazards of vacuum and [[radiation]]. [[Microgravity]] also has a negative effect on human [[physiology]] that causes both [[muscle atrophy]] and [[Spaceflight osteopenia|bone loss]]. In addition to these health and environmental issues, the economic cost of putting objects, including humans, into space is very high.

== Discovery ==
In 350 BCE, Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] suggested that ''nature abhors a vacuum'', a principle that became known as the ''[[Horror vacui (physics)|horror vacui]]''. This concept built upon a 5th-century BCE [[Ontology|ontological]] argument by the Greek philosopher [[Parmenides]], who denied the possible existence of a void in space.{{sfn|Grant|1981|p=10}} Based on this idea that a vacuum could not exist, in the [[Western culture|West]] it was widely held for many centuries that space could not be empty.{{sfn|Porter|Park|Daston|2006|p=27}} As late as the 17th century, the French philosopher [[René Descartes]] argued that the entirety of space must be filled.{{sfn|Eckert|2006|p=5}}

In [[ancient China]], the 2nd-century astronomer [[Zhang Heng]] became convinced that space must be infinite, extending well beyond the mechanism that supported the Sun and the stars. The surviving books of the Hsüan Yeh school said that the heavens were boundless, "empty and void of substance". Likewise, the "sun, moon, and the company of stars float in the empty space, moving or standing still".{{sfn|Needham|Ronan|1985|pp=82–87}}

The Italian scientist [[Galileo Galilei]] knew that air had mass and so was subject to gravity. In 1640, he demonstrated that an established force resisted the formation of a vacuum. However, it would remain for his pupil [[Evangelista Torricelli]] to create an apparatus that would produce a partial vacuum in 1643. This experiment resulted in the first mercury [[barometer]] and created a scientific sensation in Europe. The French mathematician [[Blaise Pascal]] reasoned that if the column of mercury was supported by air, then the column ought to be shorter at higher altitude where the [[air pressure]] is lower.{{sfn|Holton|Brush|2001|pp=267–268}} In 1648, his brother-in-law, Florin Périer, repeated the experiment on the [[Puy de Dôme]] mountain in central France and found that the column was shorter by three inches. This decrease in pressure was further demonstrated by carrying a half-full balloon up a mountain and watching it gradually expand, then contract upon descent.{{sfn|Cajori|1917|pp=64–66}}

[[File:Magedurger Halbkugeln Luftpumpe Deutsches Museum.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The original [[Magdeburg hemispheres]] (lower left) used to demonstrate Otto von Guericke's vacuum pump (right)|alt=A glass display case holds a mechanical device with a lever arm, plus two metal hemispheres attached to draw ropes]]

In 1650, German scientist [[Otto von Guericke]] constructed the first vacuum pump: a device that would further refute the principle of ''horror vacui''. He correctly noted that the atmosphere of the Earth surrounds the planet like a shell, with the [[density]] gradually declining with altitude. He concluded that there must be a vacuum between the Earth and the Moon.{{sfn|Genz|2001|pp=127–128}}

Back in the 15th century, German theologian [[Nicolaus Cusanus]] speculated that the [[Universe]] lacked a center and a circumference. He believed that the Universe, while not infinite, could not be held as finite as it lacked any bounds within which it could be contained.{{sfn|Tassoul|Tassoul|2004|p=22}} These ideas led to speculations as to the infinite dimension of space by the Italian philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]] in the 16th century. He extended the Copernican [[heliocentric]] [[cosmology]] to the concept of an infinite Universe filled with a substance he called [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], which did not resist the motion of heavenly bodies.{{sfn|Gatti|2002|pp=99–104}} English philosopher [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] arrived at a similar conclusion, arguing that the stars are visible to us only because they are surrounded by a thin aether or a void.{{sfn|Kelly|1965|pp=97–107}} This concept of an aether originated with [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosophers, including Aristotle, who conceived of it as the medium through which the heavenly bodies move.{{sfn|Olenick|Apostol|Goodstein|1986|p=356}}

The concept of a Universe filled with a [[luminiferous aether]] remained in vogue among some scientists until the early 20th century. This form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate.{{sfn|Hariharan|2003|p=2}} In 1887, the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] tried to detect the Earth's motion through this medium by looking for changes in the [[speed of light]] depending on the direction of the planet's motion. However, the [[null result]] indicated something was wrong with the concept. The idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned. It was replaced by [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[special relativity]], which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant, independent of the observer's motion or [[frame of reference]].{{sfn|Olenick|Apostol|Goodstein|1986|pp=357–365}}{{sfn|Thagard|1992|pp=206–209}}

The first professional [[astronomer]] to support the concept of an infinite Universe was the Englishman [[Thomas Digges]] in 1576.{{sfn|Maor|1991|p=195}} But the scale of the Universe remained unknown until the first successful measurement of the distance to a nearby star in 1838 by the German astronomer [[Friedrich Bessel]]. He showed that the star [[61 Cygni]] had a [[stellar parallax|parallax]] of just 0.31&amp;nbsp;[[arcsecond]]s (compared to the modern value of 0.287″). This corresponds to a distance of over 10 [[light year]]s.{{sfn|Webb|1999|pp=71–73}} In 1917, [[Heber Doust Curtis|Heber Curtis]] noted that [[nova]]e in spiral nebulae were, on average, 10 magnitudes fainter than galactic novae, suggesting that the former are 100 times further away.&lt;ref name=Curtis1988/&gt; The distance to the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] was determined in 1923 by American astronomer [[Edwin Hubble]] by measuring the brightness of [[cepheid variable]]s in that galaxy, a new technique discovered by [[Henrietta Leavitt]].&lt;ref name=csiro_20041025/&gt; This established that the Andromeda galaxy, and by extension all galaxies, lay well outside the [[Milky Way]].{{sfn|Tyson|Goldsmith|2004|pp=114–115}}

The earliest known estimate of the temperature of outer space was by the Swiss physicist [[Charles Édouard Guillaume|Charles É. Guillaume]] in 1896. Using the estimated radiation of the background stars, he concluded that space must be heated to a temperature of 5–6&amp;nbsp;K. British physicist [[Arthur Eddington]] made a similar calculation to derive a temperature of 3.18&amp;nbsp;K in 1926. German physicist [[Erich Regener]] used the total measured energy of [[cosmic ray]]s to estimate an intergalactic temperature of 2.8&amp;nbsp;K in 1933.&lt;ref name="Apeiron2_3_79"/&gt;

The modern concept of outer space is based on the [[Big Bang cosmology|"Big Bang" cosmology]], first proposed in 1931 by the Belgian physicist [[Georges Lemaître]].&lt;ref name=nature127_3210_706/&gt; This theory holds that the universe originated from a very dense form that has since undergone continuous [[Hubble's law|expansion]]. The background energy released during the initial expansion has steadily decreased in density, leading to a 1948 prediction by American physicists [[Ralph Alpher]] and [[Robert Herman]] of a temperature of 5&amp;nbsp;K for the temperature of space.&lt;ref name="Apeiron2_3_79"/&gt;

The term ''outward space'' was used in 1842 by the English poet Lady [[Emmeline Stuart-Wortley]] in her poem "The Maiden of Moscow".{{sfn|Stuart Wortley|1841|p=410}} The expression ''outer space'' was used as an astronomical term by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] in 1845.{{sfn|Von Humboldt|1845|p=39}} It was later popularized in the writings of [[H. G. Wells]] in 1901.&lt;ref name="entymonline"/&gt; The shorter term ''space'' is older, first used to mean the region beyond Earth's sky in [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' in 1667.&lt;ref name=harper2001/&gt;

== Formation and state ==
[[File:CMB Timeline300 no WMAP.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|This is an artist's concept of the [[metric expansion of space]], where a volume of the Universe is represented at each time interval by the circular sections. At left is depicted the rapid [[Inflationary epoch|inflation]] from the initial state, followed thereafter by steady expansion to the present day, shown at right.]]
{{Main|Big Bang}}
According to the Big Bang theory, the very early Universe was an extremely hot and dense state about [[age of the universe|13.8 billion years ago]]&lt;ref name=planck_2013 /&gt; which rapidly [[Metric expansion of space|expanded]]. About 380,000 years later the Universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen—the so-called [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination epoch]]. When this happened, matter and energy became decoupled, allowing photons to travel freely through the continually expanding space.&lt;ref name="SciAm301_1_36"/&gt; Matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create [[star]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]] and other [[astronomical object]]s, leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space.{{sfn|Silk|2000|pp=105–308}} As light has a finite velocity, this theory also constrains the size of the directly observable universe.&lt;ref name="SciAm301_1_36"/&gt; This leaves open the question as to whether the Universe is finite or infinite.

The present day [[shape of the universe]] has been determined from measurements of the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|cosmic microwave background]] using satellites like the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]]. These observations indicate that the [[spatial geometry]] of the observable universe is "[[Flatness (cosmology)|flat]]", meaning that photons on parallel paths at one point remain parallel as they travel through space to the limit of the observable universe, except for local gravity.&lt;ref name="WMAP"/&gt; The flat Universe, combined with the measured mass density of the Universe and the accelerating [[Hubble's law|expansion of the Universe]], indicates that space has a non-zero [[vacuum energy]], which is called [[dark energy]].{{sfn|Sparke|Gallagher|2007|pp=329–330}}

Estimates put the average energy density of the present day Universe at the equivalent of 5.9 protons per cubic meter, including dark energy, [[dark matter]], and [[baryonic matter]] (ordinary matter composed of atoms). The atoms account for only 4.6% of the total energy density, or a density of one proton per four cubic meters.&lt;ref name=nasa_wmap/&gt; The density of the Universe, however, is clearly not uniform; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and [[black hole]]s—to conditions in vast [[Void (astronomy)|voids]] that have much lower density, at least in terms of visible matter.&lt;ref name=aj89_1461/&gt; Unlike matter and dark matter, dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy's influence is 5 [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the Milky Way.&lt;ref name=rvmphys_75_559 /&gt;

They typically have white, red or blue hues.]]
Outer space is the closest known approximation to a [[perfect vacuum]]. It has effectively no [[friction]], allowing stars, [[planets]], and [[moons]] to move freely along their ideal [[orbit]]s, following the [[Planetary formation|initial formation]] stage. However, even the deep vacuum of [[Outer space#Intergalactic|intergalactic space]] is not devoid of [[matter]], as it contains a few [[hydrogen atoms]] per cubic meter.&lt;ref name=pasj20_230/&gt; By comparison, the air humans breathe contains about 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; molecules per cubic meter.{{sfn|Borowitz|Beiser|1971}}&lt;ref name=patrick/&gt; The low density of matter in outer space means that [[electromagnetic radiation]] can travel great distances without being scattered: the [[mean free path]] of a [[photon]] in intergalactic space is about 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km, or 10 billion light years.{{sfn|Davies|1977|p=93}} In spite of this, [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]], which is the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] and [[scattering]] of photons by dust and gas, is an important factor in galactic and intergalactic [[astronomy]].&lt;ref name=fitzpatrick2004/&gt;

Stars, planets, and moons retain their [[atmosphere]]s by gravitational attraction. Atmospheres have no clearly delineated upper boundary: the density of atmospheric gas gradually decreases with distance from the object until it becomes indistinguishable from outer space.{{sfn|Chamberlain|1978|p=2}} The Earth's atmospheric [[pressure]] drops to about {{nowrap|0.032 }}[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] at {{Convert|100|km|mi|abbr=off}} of altitude,&lt;ref name=squire2000/&gt; compared to 100,000 Pa for the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) definition of [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard pressure]]. Above this altitude, isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to [[radiation pressure]] from the [[Sun]] and the [[dynamic pressure]] of the [[solar wind]]. The [[thermosphere]] in this range has large gradients of pressure, temperature and composition, and varies greatly due to [[space weather]].&lt;ref name=jmsj_85B_193/&gt;

The temperature of outer space is measured in terms of the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic]] activity of the gas, as it is on Earth. However, the radiation of outer space has a different temperature than the kinetic temperature of the gas, meaning that the gas and radiation are not in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].{{sfn|Prialnik|2000|pp=195–196}}{{sfn|Spitzer|1978|p=28–30}} All of the observable universe is filled with photons that were created during the [[Big Bang]], which is known as the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB). (There is quite likely a correspondingly large number of [[neutrino]]s called the [[cosmic neutrino background]].&lt;ref name="fp2_30"/&gt;) The current [[black body]] temperature of the background radiation is about {{convert|3|K|C F|0|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=apj707_2_916/&gt; The gas temperatures in outer space are always at least the temperature of the CMB but can be much higher. For example, the [[corona]] of the Sun reaches temperatures over 1.2–2.6&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref name=apj325_442/&gt;

Magnetic fields have been detected in the space around just about every class of celestial object. Star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale [[dynamo]]s, creating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5–10&amp;nbsp;μ[[Gauss (unit)|G]]. The [[Davis–Greenstein effect]] causes elongated [[Cosmic dust|dust grains]] to align themselves with a galaxy's magnetic field, resulting in weak optical [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]. This has been used to show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies. [[Magnetohydrodynamics|Magneto-hydrodynamic]] processes in [[Active galactic nucleus|active]] [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] produce their characteristic [[Astrophysical jet|jets]] and [[radio lobe]]s. Non-thermal [[Astronomical radio source|radio sources]] have been detected even among the most distant, [[redshift|high-z]] sources, indicating the presence of magnetic fields.&lt;ref name=WielebinskiBeck2010/&gt;

Outside a protective atmosphere and magnetic field, there are few obstacles to the passage through space of energetic [[subatomic particle]]s known as cosmic rays. These particles have energies ranging from about 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|eV]] up to an extreme 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;eV of [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]]s.&lt;ref name=rmp83_3_907/&gt; The peak flux of cosmic rays occurs at energies of about 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;eV, with approximately 87% protons, 12% helium nuclei and 1% heavier nuclei. In the high energy range, the flux of [[electron]]s is only about 1% of that of protons.{{sfn|Lang|1999|p=462}} Cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a [[Health threat from cosmic rays|health threat]] to space travelers.{{sfn|Lide|1993|p=11{{hyphen}}217&lt;!-- Note: this is not a page range --&gt;}} According to astronauts, like [[Don Pettit]], space has a burned/metallic odor that clings to their suits and equipment, similar to the scent of an [[arc welding]] torch.&lt;ref name=ls2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="PopSicSmell"/&gt;

Despite the harsh environment, several life forms have been found that can withstand extreme space conditions for extended periods. Species of lichen carried on the ESA [[BIOPAN]] facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007.&lt;ref name="Astrobiology_11_4_281"/&gt; Seeds of ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' and ''[[Nicotiana tabacum]]'' germinated after being exposed to space for 1.5 years.&lt;ref name="Astrobiology_12_5_517"/&gt; A strain of ''[[bacillus subtilis]]'' has survived 559 days when exposed to low-Earth orbit or a simulated martian environment.&lt;ref name="Astrobiology_12_5_498"/&gt; The [[Panspermia|lithopanspermia]] hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world. A conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early in the history of the Solar System, with potentially [[microorganism]]-bearing rocks being exchanged between Venus, Earth, and Mars.&lt;ref name="Nicholson2010"/&gt;

=== Effect on human bodies ===

Even at relatively low altitudes in the Earth's atmosphere, conditions are hostile to the human body. The altitude where atmospheric pressure matches the [[vapor pressure of water]] at the [[Human body temperature|temperature of the human body]] is called the [[Armstrong line]], named after American physician [[Harry G. Armstrong]]. It is located at an altitude of around {{convert|19.14|km|mi|abbr=on}}. At or above the Armstrong line, fluids in the throat and lungs boil away. More specifically, exposed bodily liquids such as saliva, tears, and liquids in the lungs boil away. Hence, at this altitude, human survival requires a pressure suit, or a pressurized capsule.{{sfn|Piantadosi|2003|pp=188–189}}

Once in space, sudden exposure of unprotected humans to very low [[Atmospheric pressure|pressure]], such as during a rapid decompression, can cause [[pulmonary barotrauma]]—a rupture of the lungs, due to the large pressure differential between inside and outside the chest.&lt;ref name=ajeas2_4_573/&gt; Even if the subject's airway is fully open, the flow of air through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the rupture.&lt;ref name=krebs_pilmanis1996/&gt; Rapid decompression can rupture eardrums and sinuses, bruising and blood seep can occur in soft tissues, and shock can cause an increase in oxygen consumption that leads to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].&lt;ref name=ajeas2_4_573/&gt;

As a consequence of rapid decompression, [[oxygen]] dissolved in the blood empties into the lungs to try to equalize the [[partial pressure]] gradient. Once the deoxygenated blood arrives at the brain, humans lose consciousness after a few seconds and die of hypoxia within minutes.&lt;ref name=bmj286/&gt; Blood and other body fluids boil when the pressure drops below 6.3&amp;nbsp;kPa, and this condition is called [[ebullism]].&lt;ref name=jramc157_1_85/&gt; The steam may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation, but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture. Ebullism is slowed by the pressure containment of blood vessels, so some blood remains liquid.{{sfn|Billings|1973|pp=1–34}}&lt;ref name=landis20070807/&gt; Swelling and ebullism can be reduced by containment in a [[pressure suit]]. The Crew Altitude Protection Suit (CAPS), a fitted elastic garment designed in the 1960s for astronauts, prevents ebullism at pressures as low as 2 kPa.&lt;ref name=am39_376/&gt; Supplemental oxygen is needed at {{Convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} to provide enough oxygen for breathing and to prevent water loss, while above {{Convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} pressure suits are essential to prevent ebullism.{{sfn|Ellery|2000|p=68}} Most space suits use around 30–39&amp;nbsp;kPa of pure oxygen, about the same as on the Earth's surface. This pressure is high enough to prevent ebullism, but evaporation of nitrogen dissolved in the blood could still cause [[decompression sickness]] and [[air embolism|gas embolisms]] if not managed.{{sfn|Davis|Johnson|Stepanek|2008|pp=270–271}}

[[Human evolution|Humans evolved]] for life in Earth [[Gravitation|gravity]], and exposure to weightlessness has been shown to have deleterious effects on human health. Initially, more than 50% of astronauts experience [[space motion sickness]]. This can cause [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], headaches, [[lethargy]], and overall malaise. The duration of space sickness varies, but it typically lasts for 1–3 days, after which the body adjusts to the new environment. Longer-term exposure to weightlessness results in [[muscle atrophy]] and deterioration of the [[Human skeleton|skeleton]], or [[spaceflight osteopenia]]. These effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise.&lt;ref name=spp22_15/&gt; Other effects include fluid redistribution, slowing of the [[cardiovascular system]], decreased production of [[red blood cell]]s, balance disorders, and a weakening of the [[immune system]]. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, and puffiness of the face.&lt;ref name=cmaj180_13_1317/&gt;

For long-duration space travel, radiation can pose an [[acute health hazard]].
Exposure to high-energy, ionizing [[cosmic rays]] can result in fatigue, nausea, vomiting, as well as damage to the immune system and changes to the [[white blood cell]] count. Over longer durations, symptoms include an increased risk of [[cancer]], plus damage to the [[Human eye|eyes]], [[nervous system]], [[Human lung|lungs]] and the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]].&lt;ref name=nsbri_radiation/&gt; On a round-trip [[Mars]] mission lasting three years, a large fraction of the cells in an astronaut's body would be traversed and potentially damaged by high energy nuclei.&lt;ref name=curtis_and_Letaw/&gt; The energy of such particles is significantly diminished by the shielding provided by the walls of a spacecraft and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers. However, the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew. Further research is needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures.&lt;ref name=sas4_11_1013/&gt;

There is no clear boundary between [[Earth's atmosphere]] and space, as the density of the atmosphere gradually decreases as the altitude increases. There are several standard boundary designations, namely:
* The [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] has established the [[Kármán line]] at an altitude of {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} as a working definition for the boundary between aeronautics and astronautics. This is used because at an altitude of about {{Convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}, as [[Theodore von Kármán]] calculated, a vehicle would have to travel faster than [[Orbital speed|orbital velocity]] to derive sufficient [[aerodynamic lift]] from the atmosphere to support itself.{{sfn|O'Leary|2009|p=84}}&lt;ref name=space_begin/&gt;
* The United States designates people who travel above an altitude of {{convert|50|mi|km}} as [[astronaut]]s.{{sfn|Wong|Fergusson|2010|p=16}}
* [[NASA]]'s Space Shuttle used 400,000 feet (76&amp;nbsp;mi, 122&amp;nbsp;km) as its [[atmospheric reentry|re-entry]] altitude (termed the Entry Interface), which roughly marks the boundary where [[atmospheric drag]] becomes noticeable, thus beginning the process of switching from steering with thrusters to maneuvering with aerodynamic control surfaces.&lt;ref name=petty20030213/&gt;

In 2009, scientists reported detailed measurements with a Supra-Thermal Ion Imager (an instrument that measures the direction and speed of ions), which allowed them to establish a boundary at {{Convert|118|km|mi|abbr=on}} above Earth. The boundary represents the midpoint of a gradual transition over tens of kilometers from the relatively gentle winds of the Earth's atmosphere to the more violent flows of charged particles in space, which can reach speeds well over {{Convert|268|m/s|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=thompton20090409/&gt;&lt;ref name=jgr114/&gt;

The [[Outer Space Treaty]] provides the basic framework for international space law. It covers the legal use of outer space by nation states, and includes in its definition of ''outer space'' the Moon and other celestial bodies. The treaty states that outer space is free for all nation states to explore and is not subject to claims of national [[sovereignty]]. It also prohibits the deployment of [[nuclear weapon]]s in outer space. The treaty was passed by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the USSR, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. As of 2017, 105 state parties have either ratified or acceded to the treaty. An additional 25 states signed the treaty, without ratifying it.&lt;ref name="unoosa2" /&gt;.&lt;ref name=unoosa/&gt;

Since 1958, outer space has been the subject of multiple United Nations resolutions. Of these, more than 50 have been concerning the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space.&lt;ref name=garros/&gt; Four additional [[space law]] treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's [[United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space|Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space]]. Still, there remains no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons in space, and [[anti-satellite weapon]]s have been successfully tested by the US, USSR and China.{{sfn|Wong|Fergusson|2010|p=4}} The 1979 [[Moon Treaty]] turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. However, this treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices manned spaceflight.&lt;ref name=esf20071105/&gt;

In 1976, eight equatorial states ([[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Zaire]], [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], and [[Indonesia]]) met in [[Bogotá]], Colombia. With their "Declaration of the First Meeting of Equatorial Countries", or "the Bogotá Declaration", they claimed control of the segment of the geosynchronous orbital path corresponding to each country.&lt;ref name=bogota1976/&gt; These claims are not internationally accepted.&lt;ref name=aasl31_2006/&gt;

== Earth orbit ==
A spacecraft enters orbit when its [[Centripetal force|centripetal]] [[acceleration]] due to [[Gravitation|gravity]] is less than or equal to the [[centrifugal force|centrifugal]] acceleration due to the horizontal component of its velocity. For a [[low Earth orbit]], this velocity is about {{Convert|7800|m/s|km/h mph|-2|abbr=on}};&lt;ref name=hill1999/&gt; by contrast, the fastest manned airplane speed ever achieved (excluding speeds achieved by deorbiting spacecraft) was {{Convert|2200|m/s|km/h mph|-2|abbr=on}} in 1967 by the [[North American X-15]].&lt;ref name=shiner20071101/&gt;

To achieve an orbit, a [[spacecraft]] must travel faster than a [[sub-orbital spaceflight]]. The energy required to reach Earth orbital velocity at an altitude of {{Convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on}} is about 36&amp;nbsp;[[Megajoule|MJ]]/kg, which is six times the energy needed merely to climb to the corresponding altitude.&lt;ref name=dimotakis1999/&gt; Spacecraft with a [[Apsis|perigee]] below about {{Convert|2,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} are subject to drag from the Earth's atmosphere,{{sfn|Ghosh|2000|pp=47–48}} which decreases the orbital altitude. The rate of orbital decay depends on the satellite's cross-sectional area and mass, as well as variations in the air density of the upper atmosphere. Below about {{Convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}}, decay becomes more rapid with lifetimes measured in days. Once a satellite descends to {{Convert|180|km|mi|abbr=on}}, it has only hours before it vaporizes in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=slsa/&gt; The [[escape velocity]] required to pull free of Earth's gravitational field altogether and move into interplanetary space is about {{Convert|11200|m/s|km/h mph|-2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=williams2010/&gt;

== Regions ==
Space is a partial vacuum: its different regions are defined by the various atmospheres and "winds" that dominate within them, and extend to the point at which those winds give way to those beyond. Geospace extends from Earth's atmosphere to the outer reaches of Earth's magnetic field, whereupon it gives way to the solar wind of interplanetary space.{{sfn|Schrijver|Siscoe|2010|p=363}} Interplanetary space extends to the heliopause, whereupon the solar wind gives way to the winds of the [[interstellar medium]].&lt;ref name=universetoday_interplanetaryspace /&gt; Interstellar space then continues to the edges of the galaxy, where it fades into the intergalactic void.&lt;ref name=jpl_interstellarspace /&gt;

=== Geospace ===
[[File:Aurora-SpaceShuttle-EO.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aurora (astronomy)|Aurora australis]] observed from the [[Space Shuttle]] ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', on [[STS-39]], May 1991 (orbital altitude: 260 km)|alt=The lower half is the blue-white planet in low illumination. Nebulous red streamers climb upward from the limb of the disk toward the black sky. The Space Shuttle is visible along the left edge.]]

[[wikt:geospace|Geospace]] is the region of outer space near Earth, including the upper atmosphere and [[magnetosphere]].{{sfn|Schrijver|Siscoe|2010|p=363}} The [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s lie within the geospace. The outer boundary of geospace is the [[magnetopause]], which forms an interface between the Earth's magnetosphere and the solar wind. The inner boundary is the [[ionosphere]].&lt;ref name=geospace/&gt; The variable space-weather conditions of geospace are affected by the behavior of the Sun and the solar wind; the subject of geospace is interlinked with [[heliophysics]] -- the study of the Sun and its impact on the planets of the Solar System.{{sfn|Fichtner|Liu|2011|pp=341–345}}

The day-side magnetopause is compressed by solar-wind pressure -- the subsolar distance from the center of the Earth is typically 10 Earth radii. On the night side, the solar wind stretches the magnetosphere to form a [[magnetotail]] that sometimes extends out to more than 100–200 Earth radii.{{sfn|Koskinen|2010|pp=32, 42}}&lt;ref name=HonesJr1986/&gt; For roughly four days of each month, the lunar surface is shielded from the solar wind as the Moon passes through the magnetotail.{{sfn|Mendillo|2000|p=275}}

Geospace is populated by electrically charged particles at very low densities, the motions of which are controlled by the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. These plasmas form a medium from which storm-like disturbances powered by the solar wind can drive electrical currents into the Earth's upper atmosphere. [[Geomagnetic storm]]s can disturb two regions of geospace, the radiation belts and the ionosphere. These storms increase fluxes of energetic electrons that can permanently damage satellite electronics, interfering with shortwave radio communication and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] location and timing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Space Weather &amp; Telecommunications |first=John M. |last=Goodman |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4465qvHUZusC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=effect+space+weather+shortwave+gps&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwis_6eZ88rXAhVCx1QKHcYaB4kQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnetic storms can also be a hazard to astronauts, even in low Earth orbit. They also create [[aurora (astronomy)|aurorae]] seen at high latitudes in an oval surrounding the [[geomagnetic pole]]s.&lt;ref name=oecd/&gt;

Although it meets the definition of outer space, the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the Kármán line is still sufficient to produce significant [[Drag (physics)|drag]] on [[satellite]]s.&lt;ref name=slsa/&gt; This region contains material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches that are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this [[space debris|debris]] re-enters Earth's atmosphere periodically.&lt;ref name=portree_loftus1999/&gt;

====Cislunar space====
[[File:Artist's concept of Cislunar Spacecraft Configuration.jpg|right|thumb|Proposed spacecraft for manned cislunar travel in the [[2020s in spaceflight|2020s]]]]

[[gravity of Earth|Earth's gravity]] keeps the [[Moon]] in orbit at an [[lunar distance (astronomy)|average distance]] of {{cvt|384403|km|mi}}. The region outside [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] and extending out to just beyond the [[orbit of the Moon|Moon's orbit]], including the [[Lagrangian point]]s, is sometimes referred to as '''cislunar space'''.&lt;ref name=sr2165/&gt;

The region of space where Earth's gravity remains dominant against gravitational [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] from the Sun is called the [[Hill sphere]].&lt;ref name=yoder1995/&gt; This extends well out into translunar space to a distance of roughly 1% of the mean distance from Earth to the Sun,{{sfn|Barbieri|2006|p=253}} or {{convert|1.5|e6km|e6mi|abbr=unit}}.

'''Deep space''' has different definitions as to where it starts. It has been defined by the United States government and others as any region beyond cislunar space.{{sfn|Dickson|2010|p=57}}{{sfn|United States|p=536}}{{sfn|Williamson|2006|p=97}}&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt; The [[ITU-R|International Telecommunication Union responsible for radio communication]] (including satellites) defines the beginning of deep space at about 5 times that distance ({{Val|2e6|u=km}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://life.itu.int/radioclub/rr/art1.pdf |title=ITU-R Radio Regulations, Article 1, Terms and definitions, Section VIII, Technical terms relating to space, paragraph 1.177. |publisher=International Telecommunication Union |accessdate=2018-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interplanetary space ===
{{main|Interplanetary medium}}
[[File:Comet Hale-Bopp 1995O1.jpg|right|thumb|The sparse plasma (blue) and dust (white) in the tail of [[comet Hale–Bopp]] are being shaped by pressure from [[Sunlight|solar radiation]] and the solar wind, respectively|alt=At lower left, a white coma stands out against a black background. Nebulous material streams away to the top and left, slowly fading with distance.]]
Interplanetary space is defined by the solar wind, a continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun that creates a very tenuous atmosphere (the [[heliosphere]]) for billions of kilometers into space. This wind has a particle density of 5–10 [[proton]]s/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and is moving at a velocity of {{Convert|350|-|400|km/s|mph|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Papagiannis|1972|pp=12–149}} Interplanetary space extends out to the [[Astropause|heliopause]] where the influence of the galactic environment starts to dominate over the magnetic field and particle flux from the Sun.&lt;ref name=universetoday_interplanetaryspace /&gt; The distance and strength of the heliopause varies depending on the activity level of the solar wind.&lt;ref name=phillips2009/&gt;

The volume of interplanetary space is a nearly total vacuum, with a mean free path of about one [[astronomical unit]] at the orbital distance of the Earth. However, this space is not completely empty, and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays, which include [[ion]]ized [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and various subatomic particles. There is also gas, [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and dust, small [[meteor]]s, and several dozen types of [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[molecule]]s discovered to date by [[rotational spectroscopy|microwave spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name=asp2003/&gt; A cloud of interplanetary dust is visible at night as a faint band called the [[zodiacal light]].&lt;ref name="leinert_grun_1990"/&gt;

Interplanetary space contains the magnetic field generated by the Sun.{{sfn|Papagiannis|1972|pp=12–149}} There are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and the Earth that have their own magnetic fields. These are shaped by the influence of the solar wind into the approximation of a teardrop shape, with the long tail extending outward behind the planet. These magnetic fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources, creating belts of charged particles such as the Van Allen radiation belts. Planets without magnetic fields, such as Mars, have their atmospheres gradually eroded by the solar wind.&lt;ref name=ssr69_3_215/&gt;

=== Interstellar space ===
{{main|Interstellar medium}}
{{Redirect|Interstellar space|the album|Interstellar Space}}
[[File:52706main hstorion lg.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bow shock]] formed by the [[magnetosphere]] of the young star [[LL Orionis]] (center) as it collides with the [[Orion Nebula]] flow|alt=Patchy orange and blue nebulosity against a black background, with a curved orange arc wrapping around a star at the center.]]
Interstellar space is the physical space within a galaxy beyond the influence each star has upon the encompassed plasma.&lt;ref name=jpl_interstellarspace /&gt; The contents of interstellar space are called the interstellar medium. Approximately 70% of the mass of the interstellar medium consists of lone hydrogen atoms; most of the remainder consists of helium atoms. This is enriched with trace amounts of heavier atoms formed through [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. These atoms are ejected into the interstellar medium by [[stellar wind]]s or when evolved stars begin to shed their outer envelopes such as during the formation of a [[planetary nebula]].&lt;ref name="Ferrière2001"/&gt; The cataclysmic explosion of a [[supernova]] generates an expanding [[shock wave]] consisting of ejected materials that further enrich the medium.&lt;ref name="witt2001"/&gt; The density of matter in the interstellar medium can vary considerably: the average is around 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; particles per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref name=Boulares1990/&gt; but cold [[molecular clouds]] can hold 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.{{sfn|Prialnik|2000|pp=195–196}}&lt;ref name="Ferrière2001"/&gt;

A [[List of interstellar and circumstellar molecules|number of molecules]] exist in interstellar space, as can tiny 0.1&amp;nbsp;[[Micrometre|μm]] dust particles.{{sfn|Rauchfuss|2008|pp=72–81}} The tally of molecules discovered through [[radio astronomy]] is steadily increasing at the rate of about four new species per year. Large regions of higher density matter known as [[molecular cloud]]s allow chemical reactions to occur, including the formation of organic polyatomic species. Much of this chemistry is driven by collisions. Energetic cosmic rays penetrate the cold, dense clouds and ionize hydrogen and helium, resulting, for example, in the [[trihydrogen cation]]. An ionized helium atom can then split relatively abundant [[carbon monoxide]] to produce ionized carbon, which in turn can lead to organic chemical reactions.&lt;ref name="PNAS103_33_12232"/&gt;

The local interstellar medium is a region of space within 100&amp;nbsp;[[parsec]]s (pc) of the Sun, which is of interest both for its proximity and for its interaction with the Solar System. This volume nearly coincides with a region of space known as the [[Local Bubble]], which is characterized by a lack of dense, cold clouds. It forms a cavity in the [[Orion Arm]] of the Milky Way galaxy, with dense molecular clouds lying along the borders, such as those in the [[constellation]]s of [[Ophiuchus]] and [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]. (The actual distance to the border of this cavity varies from 60 to 250&amp;nbsp;pc or more.) This volume contains about 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; stars and the local interstellar gas counterbalances the [[Stellar-wind bubble|astrospheres]] that surround these stars, with the volume of each sphere varying depending on the local density of the interstellar medium. The Local Bubble contains dozens of warm interstellar clouds with temperatures of up to 7,000&amp;nbsp;K and radii of 0.5–5&amp;nbsp;pc.&lt;ref name=redfield2006/&gt;

When stars are moving at sufficiently high [[peculiar velocities]], their astrospheres can generate [[bow shock]]s as they collide with the interstellar medium. For decades it was assumed that the Sun had a bow shock. In 2012, data from [[Interstellar Boundary Explorer|Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX)]] and NASA's [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes showed that the Sun's bow shock does not exist. Instead, these authors argue that a [[Mach number|subsonic]] bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the interstellar medium.&lt;ref name=bow_science/&gt;&lt;ref name=bow/&gt; A bow shock is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the [[Heliosphere#Termination shock|termination shock]] and the astropause (called the heliopause in the Solar System).&lt;ref name=bow/&gt;

=== Intergalactic space ===
[[File:LH 95.jpg|thumb|right|[[LH 95|A]] [[star]]-forming region in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]], perhaps the closest Galaxy to Earth's [[Milky Way]]]]
{{See also|Intracluster medium}}
Intergalactic space is the physical space between galaxies. Studies of the large scale distribution of galaxies show that the Universe has a foam-like structure, with [[Galaxy groups and clusters|clusters and groups of galaxies]] lying along filaments that occupy about a tenth of the total space. The remainder forms huge voids that are mostly empty of galaxies. Typically, a [[Void (astronomy)|void]] spans a distance of (10–40) ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Mpc, where ''h'' is the [[Hubble constant]] in units of {{nowrap|100 km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Mpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.{{sfn|Wszolek|2013|p=67}}

Surrounding and stretching between galaxies, there is a [[rarefaction|rarefied]] plasma&lt;ref name=jafelice_opher1992/&gt; that is organized in a [[galaxy filament|galactic filamentary]] structure.&lt;ref name=wadsley2002/&gt; This material is called the intergalactic medium (IGM). The density of the IGM is 5–200 times the average density of the Universe.&lt;ref name="apj_714_1715"/&gt; It consists mostly of ionized hydrogen; i.e. a plasma consisting of equal numbers of electrons and protons. As gas falls into the intergalactic medium from the voids, it heats up to temperatures of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K to 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K,&lt;ref name=baas41_908/&gt; which is high enough so that collisions between atoms have enough energy to cause the bound electrons to escape from the hydrogen nuclei; this is why the IGM is ionized. At these temperatures, it is called the [[warm–hot intergalactic medium]] (WHIM). (Although the plasma is very hot by terrestrial standards, 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; K is often called "warm" in astrophysics.) Computer simulations and observations indicate that up to half of the atomic matter in the Universe might exist in this warm–hot, rarefied state.&lt;ref name="apj_714_1715" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ssr134_1_141/&gt;&lt;ref name="apjs_182_378"/&gt; When gas falls from the filamentary structures of the WHIM into the galaxy clusters at the intersections of the cosmic filaments, it can heat up even more, reaching temperatures of 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K and above in the so-called intracluster medium.&lt;ref name="apj546_100"/&gt;

== Exploration and applications ==
{{Main|Space exploration|Space colonization|Space manufacturing}}
[[File:As08-16-2593.jpg|right|thumb|The first image taken of the entire Earth by astronauts was shot during the [[Apollo 8]] mission|alt=An blue-white disk against a black background. Brown areas of ground are visible in some areas through openings in the swirling white clouds. The lower left of the disk is in partial shadow.]]

For the majority of human history, space was explored by observations made from the Earth's surface—initially with the unaided eye and then with the telescope. Prior to the advent of reliable rocket technology, the closest that humans had come to reaching outer space was through the use of balloon flights. In 1935, the U.S. ''[[Explorer II]]'' manned balloon flight had reached an altitude of {{Convert|22|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=ssr13_2_199/&gt; This was greatly exceeded in 1942 when the third launch of the German [[V-2 rocket|A-4 rocket]] climbed to an altitude of about {{Convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}}. In 1957, the unmanned satellite ''[[Sputnik 1]]'' was launched by a Russian [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7 rocket]], achieving Earth orbit at an altitude of {{Convert|215|-|939|km|mi}}.{{sfn|O'Leary|2009|pp=209–224}} This was followed by the first human spaceflight in 1961, when [[Yuri Gagarin]] was sent into orbit on [[Vostok 1]]. The first humans to escape low-Earth orbit were [[Frank Borman]], [[Jim Lovell]] and [[William Anders]] in 1968 on board the U.S. [[Apollo 8]], which achieved lunar orbit{{sfn|Harrison|2002|pp=60–63}} and reached a maximum distance of {{Convert|377349|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Earth.{{sfn|Orloff|2001}}

The first spacecraft to reach escape velocity was the Soviet [[Luna 1]], which performed a fly-by of the Moon in 1959.{{sfn|Hardesty|Eisman|Krushchev|2008|pp=89–90}} In 1961, [[Venera 1]] became the first planetary probe. It revealed the presence of the solar wind and performed the first fly-by of [[Venus]], although contact was lost before reaching Venus. The first successful planetary mission was the 1962 fly-by of Venus by [[Mariner 2]].{{sfn|Collins|2007|p=86}} The first fly-by of Mars was by [[Mariner 4]] in 1964. Since that time, unmanned spacecraft have successfully examined each of the Solar System's planets, as well their moons and many [[minor planet]]s and comets. They remain a fundamental tool for the exploration of outer space, as well as observation of the Earth.{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=7, 68–69}} In August 2012, [[Voyager 1]] became the first man-made object to leave the Solar System and enter [[interstellar space]].&lt;ref name="mike_wall"/&gt;

The absence of air makes outer space an ideal location for astronomy at all wavelengths of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. This is evidenced by the spectacular pictures sent back by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], allowing light from more than 13&amp;nbsp;billion years ago—almost to the time of the Big Bang—to be observed.&lt;ref name=hubblesite_cosmicdawn /&gt; However, not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The [[Interplanetary dust cloud|interplanetary zodiacal dust]] emits a diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an [[infrared telescope]] out past the dust increases its effectiveness.&lt;ref name=esa105/&gt; Likewise, a site like the [[Daedalus (crater)|Daedalus crater]] on the [[far side of the Moon]] could shield a [[radio telescope]] from the [[Electromagnetic interference|radio frequency interference]] that hampers Earth-based observations.&lt;ref name=maccone2001/&gt;

Unmanned spacecraft in Earth orbit are an essential technology of modern civilization. They allow direct monitoring of [[Weather satellite|weather conditions]], relay [[Communications satellite|long-range communications]] like television, provide a means of [[Satellite navigation|precise navigation]], and allow [[remote sensing]] of the Earth. The latter role serves a wide variety of purposes, including tracking soil moisture for agriculture, prediction of water outflow from seasonal snow packs, detection of diseases in plants and trees, and [[Spy satellite|surveillance]] of military activities.{{sfn|Razani|2012|pp=97–99}}

The deep vacuum of space could make it an attractive environment for certain industrial processes, such as those requiring ultraclean surfaces.&lt;ref name=chapman1991/&gt; However, like [[asteroid mining]], [[space manufacturing]] requires significant investment with little prospect of immediate return.&lt;ref name="IJA10_307"/&gt; An important factor in the total expense is the high cost of placing mass into Earth orbit: ${{Inflation|US|6000|2006|r=-3|fmt=c}}–{{Inflation|US|20000|2006|r=-3|fmt=c}} per kg in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to a 2006 estimate.&lt;ref name="jsr43_3_696"/&gt; Proposed concepts for addressing this issue include [[non-rocket spacelaunch]], [[momentum exchange tether]]s, and [[space elevators]].{{sfn|Bolonkin|2010|p=xv}}

[[Interstellar travel]] for a human crew remains at present only a theoretical possibility. The distances to the nearest stars will require new technological developments and the ability to safely sustain crews for journeys lasting several decades. For example, the [[Daedalus Project]] study, which proposed a spacecraft powered by the [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] of [[Deuterium]] and [[Helium-3|He&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]], would require 36 years to reach the nearby [[Alpha Centauri]] system. Other proposed interstellar propulsion systems include [[light sail]]s, [[Bussard ramjet|ramjets]], and [[beam-powered propulsion]]. More advanced propulsion systems could use [[antimatter]] as a fuel, potentially reaching [[Relativistic speed|relativistic velocities]].&lt;ref name=Crawford1990/&gt;

'''Physis''' (Greek: {{lang|grc|φύσις|italic=yes}} ''phusis'') is a Greek [[theology|theological]], [[philosophy|philosophical]], and [[science|scientific]] term usually translated into English as "[[nature (philosophy)|nature]]".

The term is central to [[Greek philosophy]], and as a consequence to [[Western philosophy]] as a whole.
In [[pre-Socratic]] usage, ''phusis'' contrasted with {{lang|grc|νόμος}} ''nomos'' "law, human convention"
Since  [[Aristotle]], however, the ''physical'' (the subject matter of ''[[physics]]'', properly  {{lang|grc|τὰ φυσικά}} "natural things") has more typically  been juxtaposed to the ''[[metaphysics|metaphysical]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Discussed in Aristotle's works so titled, ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' "Physis, translated since the Third Century B.C. usually as "nature" and less frequently as "essence", means one thing for the presocratic philosophers and quite another thing for Plato."

== Pre-socratic usage ==
The word φύσις is a verbal noun based on [[:wikt:φύω|φύω]] "to grow, to appear" ([[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/bʰuH-|cognate]] with English "to be"). In [[Homeric Greek]] it is used quite literally, of the manner of growth of a particular species of plant.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Odyssey]]'' 10.302-3:  {{lang|grc|ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι '''φύσιν''' αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε}}. (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its '''nature'''.) ''[[Odyssey]]''  (ed. A.T. Murray).&lt;/ref&gt;  

In [[pre-Socratic philosophers|pre-Socratic]] philosophy, beginning with [[Heraclitus]], ''phusis'' in keeping with its etymology of "growing, becoming" is always used in the sense of the "natural" ''development'', although the focus might lie either with the origin, or the process, or the end result of the process. There is some evidence that by the 6th century BC, beginning with the [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Ionian School]], the word could also be used 
in the comprehensive sense, as referring to "''all'' things", as it were "Nature" in the sense of "[[Universe]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Naddaf, ''The Greek Concept of Nature'', SUNY Press, 2005, p. 3.
Guthrie, W. K. C., ''Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'' (volume 2 of his ''History of Greek Philosophy''), Cambridge UP, 1965.{{page needed|date=December 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Sophist]] tradition, the term stood in opposition to ''[[:wikt:nomos|nomos]]'' ({{lang|grc|νόμος}}), "[[law]]" or "[[convention (norm)|custom]]", in the debate on which parts of human existence are natural, and which are due to convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dunkie |first1=Roger |title=The Classical Origins of Western Culture: The Core Studies 1 Study Guide |url=http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/studyguide/studygde.htm |accessdate=30 January 2012 |series=Brooklyn College Core Curriculum Series |date=1986 |publisher=[[Brooklyn College]] |location=[[Brooklyn, NY]]  |chapter=Philosophical background of the 5th Century B.C. |chapterurl=http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/studyguide/sophists.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The contrast of ''phisis'' vs. ''[[:wikt:nomos|nomos]]'' could be applied to any subject, much like the modern contrast of "[[nature vs. nurture]]".

== In Plato's Laws ==
In book 10 of ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'', Plato criticizes those who write works ''peri phuseōs''. The criticism is that such authors tend to focus on a purely "naturalistic" explanation of the world, ignoring the role of "intention" or ''technē'', and thus becoming prone to the error of naive [[History_of_atheism#Classical_Greece_and_Rome|atheism]]. Plato accuses even [[Theogony|Hesiod]] of this, for the reason that the gods in Hesiod "grow" out of primordial entities after the physical universe had been established.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Naddaf, ''The Greek Concept of Nature'' (2005), 1f.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Because those who use the term mean to say that nature is the first creative power; but if the soul turns out to be the primeval element, and not fire or air, then in the truest sense and beyond other things the soul may be said to exist ''by'' nature; and this would be true if you proved that the soul is older than the body, but not otherwise."
::— Plato's Laws, Book 10(892c) – ''translation by Benjamin Jowett''

== Aristotle ==
Aristotle sought out the definition of "physis" to prove that there was more than one definition of "physis", and more than one way to interpret nature. "Though Aristotle retains the ancient sense of "physis" as growth, he insists that an adequate definition of "physis" requires the different perspectives of the [[four causes]] (aitia): material, efficient, formal, and final."&lt;ref name="Rhetoric Reclaimed"&gt;Atwill, Janet. "The Interstices of Nature, Spontaneity, and Chance." Rhetoric Reclaimed: Aristotle and the Liberal Arts Tradition. Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP, 1998. N. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that nature itself contained its own source of matter (material), power/motion (efficiency), form, and end (final). A unique feature about Aristotle's definition of "physis" was his relationship between art and nature. Aristotle said that "physis" (nature) is dependent on [[techne]] (art). "The critical distinction between art and nature concerns their different efficient causes: nature is its own source of motion, whereas techne always requires a source of motion outside itself."&lt;ref name="Rhetoric Reclaimed" /&gt; What Aristotle was trying to bring to light, was that art does not contain within itself its form or source of motion. Consider the process of an acorn becoming an oak tree. This is a natural process that has its own driving force behind it. There is no external force pushing this acorn to its final state, rather it is progressively developing towards one specific end ([[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]).


==Biblical usage==
Though φύσις was often used in Hellenistic philosophy, it is used only 14 times in the New Testament (10 of those in the writings of Paul).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balz|first1=Horst Robert|title=Exegetical dictionary of the New Testament|publisher=[[William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company]]|location=Michigan1994|isbn=9780802828033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its meaning varies throughout Paul's writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verbrugge|first1=Verlyn D.|title=New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology|date=2000|publisher=[[Zondervan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One usage refers to the established or natural order of things, as in ''Romans 2:14'' where Paul writes "For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by ''nature'' do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Romans|2:14|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danker|first1=Frederick W.|title=A Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian literature|date=2014|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another use of φύσις in the sense of "natural order" is ''Romans 1:26'' where he writes "the men likewise gave up ''natural'' relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another".&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Romans|1:26-1:27|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danker|first1=Frederick W.|title=A Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian literature|date=2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''1 Corinthians 11:14'', Paul asks "Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Corinthians|11:13|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balz|first1=Horst Robert|title=Exegetical dictionary of the New Testament|publisher=William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company|location=Michigan1994|isbn=9780802828033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of φύσις as referring to a "natural order" in ''Romans 1:26'' and ''1 Corinthians 11:14''  may have been influenced by [[Stoicism]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Greek philosophers, including [[Aristotle]] and the Stoics are credited with distinguishing between man-made laws and a [[natural law]] of universal validity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of the Classical World|date=2007|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192801463.001.0001/acref-9780192801463-e-1250.|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Gerhard Kittel]] states that the Stoic philosophers were not able to combine the concepts of νόμος (law) and φύσις (nature) to produce the concept of "natural law" in the sense that was made possible by [[Judeo-Christian]] theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kittel|first1=Gerhard|title=Theological Dictionary of the New Testament|publisher=Eerdman's Publishing Company|location=Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline theology]] of [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] by [[Grace in Christianity|grace]], Paul writes in ''Ephesians 2:3'' that "we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by ''nature'' children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. In the next verse he writes, "by grace you have been saved." &lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Ephesians|2:3-2:4|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verbrugge|first1=Verlyn D.|title=New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology|date=2000|publisher=Zondervan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage in patristic theology ==
Theologians of the early Christian period differed in the usage of this term. In [[School of Antioch|Antiochene]] circles, it connoted the humanity or divinity of Christ conceived as a concrete set of characteristics or attributes. In [[Alexandrian School|Alexandrine]] thinking, it meant a concrete individual or independent existent and approximated to [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]] without being a synonym.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, J.N.D. ''Early Christian Doctrines'' A&amp;C Black(1965) p.318&lt;/ref&gt;  While it refers to much the same thing as [[ousia]] it is more empirical and descriptive focussing on function while ousia is metaphysical and focuses more on reality.&lt;ref name="GiPT"&gt;Prestige, G.L. ''God in Patristic Thought'', SPCK (1964), p.234&lt;/ref&gt; Although found in the context of the [[Trinity|Trinitarian debate]], it is chiefly important in the [[Christology]] of [[Cyril of Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="GiPT"/&gt;

== Modern usage ==
The Greek adjective ''phusikos'' is represented  in various forms in modern English:
As ''[[physics]]'' "the study of nature", as ''[[:wikt:physical|physical]]'' (via Middle Latin ''physicalis'') referring both to physics (the study of nature, the material universe) and to the [[human body]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=physical |title=Physical |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |accessdate=20 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[physiology]] (''physiologia'') is of 16th-century coinage ([[Jean Fernel]]). The term ''physique'', for "the bodily constitution of a person", is a 19th-century loan from French. 

In medicine the suffix ''-physis'' occurs in such compounds as ''[[symphysis]]'', ''[[epiphysis]]'', and a few others, in the sense of "a growth". The physis also refers to the "[[Epiphyseal plate|growth plate]]", or site of growth at the end of long bones.

'''Primary energy''' ('''PE''') is an [[energy]] form found in nature that has not been subjected to any [[energy engineering|human engineered]] conversion process. It is energy contained in raw [[fuel|fuels]], and other forms of energy received as input to a [[system]]. Primary energy can be [[non-renewable resource|non-renewable]] or [[renewable energy|renewable]].

Where primary energy is used to describe fossil fuels, the [[embodied energy]] of the fuel is available as thermal energy and around 70% is typically lost in conversion to electrical or mechanical energy. There is a similar 60-80% conversion loss when solar and wind energy is converted to electricity, but today's UN conventions on energy statistics counts the electricity made from wind and solar as the primary energy itself for these sources. One consequence of this counting method is that the contribution of wind and solar energy is under reported compared to fossil energy sources, and there is hence an international debate on how to count primary energy from wind and solar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sauar|first1=Erik|title=IEA underreports contribution solar and wind by a factor of three compared to fossil fuels|url=http://energypost.eu/iea-underreports-contribution-solar-wind-factor-three-compared-fossil-fuels/|website=energypost.eu|publisher=Energy Post|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Total primary energy supply''' ('''TPES''') is the sum of production and imports subtracting exports and storage changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/factbook-2013-en/06/01/01/index.html?contentType=&amp;itemId=%2fcontent%2fchapter%2ffactbook-2013-41-en&amp;mimeType=text%2fhtml&amp;containerItemId=%2fcontent%2fserial%2f18147364&amp;accessItemIds=|title=OECD Factbook 2013: Economic, Environmental and Social Statistics|year=2013|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of primary energy is used in [[energy distance|energy statistics]] in the compilation of [[energy accounting|energy balances]], as well as in the field of [[energetics]]. In energetics, a primary energy source (PES) refers to the energy forms required by the energy sector to generate the supply of [[energy carrier|energy carriers]] used by human society.&lt;ref name="GIAMPIETROMAYUMI2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Giampietro |first1=Mario |last2=Mayumi |first2=Kozo |title=The Biofuel Delusion: The Fallacy of Large Scale Agro-Biofuels Production |publisher=Earthscan, Taylor &amp; Francis group |year=2009 |pages=336 |isbn=978-1-84407-681-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secondary energy''' is a carrier of energy, such as electricity. These are produced by conversion from a primary energy source.

The use of primary energy as a measure ignores conversion efficiency. Thus forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency, particularly the thermal sources, coal, gas and nuclear are overstated, whereas energy sources such as hydroelectricity which are converted efficiently, while a small fraction of primary energy are significantly more important than their total raw energy supply may seem to imply.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

PE and TPES are better defined in the context of [[worldwide energy supply]].

==Examples of sources==
Primary energy sources should not be confused with the [[energy system]] components (or conversion processes) through which they are converted into energy carriers.

==Usable energy==
{{main|exergy}}
[[File:Different energy forms (PES).png|thumb|Primary energy sources are transformed by the energy sector to generate energy carriers.]]
Primary energy sources are transformed in [[energy conversion]] processes to more convenient forms of energy that can directly be used by society, such as [[electrical energy]], refined [[fuels]], or synthetic fuels such as [[hydrogen fuel]]. In the field of [[energetics]], these forms are called [[energy carrier]]s and correspond to the concept of "secondary energy" in energy statistics.

===Conversion to energy carriers (or secondary energy)===
Energy carriers are energy forms which have been transformed from primary energy sources. Electricity is one of the most common energy carriers, being transformed from various primary energy sources such as coal, oil, natural gas, and wind. Electricity is particularly useful since it has low entropy (is highly ordered) and so can be converted into other forms of energy very efficiently. [[District heating]] is another example of secondary energy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/understand-metrics/difference   U.S. EPA Energy STAR] Retrieved 2017-11-03&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[laws of thermodynamics]], primary energy sources cannot be produced. They must be available to society to enable the production of energy carriers.&lt;ref name="GIAMPIETROMAYUMI2009" /&gt;

[[Thermal efficiency|Conversion efficiency]] varies. For thermal energy, electricity and mechanical energy production is limited by [[Carnot's theorem]], and generates a lot of [[waste heat]]. Other non-thermal conversions can be more efficient. For example, while wind turbines do not capture all of the wind's energy, they have a high conversion efficiency and generate very little waste heat since wind energy is low entropy. In principle solar photovoltaic conversions could be very efficient, but current conversion can only be done well for narrow ranges of wavelength, whereas solar thermal is also subject to Carnot efficiency limits. Hydroelectric power is also very ordered, and converted very efficiently. The amount of usable energy is the [[exergy]] of a system.

===Site and source energy===
Site energy is the term used in North America for the amount of end-use energy of all forms consumed at a specified location. This can be a mix of primary energy (such as natural gas burned at the site) and secondary energy (such as electricity). Site energy is measured at the campus, building, or sub-building level and is the basis for energy charges on utility bills.&lt;ref name="NRCan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring energy: site energy vs. source energy in ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager|url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/efficiency/buildings/energy-benchmarking/update/getready/19453|publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]]|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Source energy, in contrast, is the term used in North America for the amount of primary energy consumed in order to provide a facility’s site energy. It is always greater than the site energy, as it includes all site energy and adds to it the energy lost during transmission, delivery, and conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torcellini|first=Paul|last2=Pless|first2=Shanti|last3=Deru|first3=Michael|last4=Crawley|first4=Drury|date=June 2006|title=Zero energy buildings: a critical look at the definition|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/39833.pdf|journal=ACEEE Summer Study|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory/U.S. Department of Energy|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While source or primary energy provides a more complete picture of energy consumption, it cannot be measured directly and must be calculated using conversion factors from site energy measurements.&lt;ref name="NRCan" /&gt; For electricity, a typical value is three units of source energy for one unit of site energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Site Energy vs Source Energy|url=http://wbi.worldbank.org/energy/content/site-energy-vs-source-energy|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this can vary considerably depending on factors such as the primary energy source or fuel type, the type of power plant, and the transmission infrastructure.

Energy accidents are accidents that occur in systems that provide energy or power. These can result in fatalities, as can the normal running of many systems, for example those deaths due to pollution.

Globally, coal is responsible for 100,000 deaths per trillion kWh.&lt;ref name=deadly&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/#2f9f079649d2 How Deadly Is Your Kilowatt? We Rank The Killer Energy Sources James Conca, June 10, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''relational theory of space''' is a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory according to which [[space]] is composed of relations between objects, with the implication that it cannot exist in the absence of matter. Its opposite is the [[container space|container]] theory. A [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[physics|physical]] theory implies a [[relation (philosophy)|relational metaphysics]], but not the other way round: even if space is composed of nothing but relations between [[observer (relativity)|observer]]s and [[event (relativity)|event]]s, it would be conceptually possible for all observers to agree on their measurements, whereas relativity implies they will disagree. [[Newtonian physics]] can be cast in [[Galilean invariance|relational terms]], but Newton insisted, for philosophical reasons, on [[Absolute time and space|absolute]] (container) space. The subject was famously debated by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and a supporter of Newton's in the [[Leibniz–Clarke correspondence]].

An absolute approach can also be applied to [[time]], with, for instance, the implication that there might have been vast epochs of time before the first [[event (philosophy)|event]].&lt;ref&gt;''Physics and Metaphysics: Theories of Space and Time'' by Jennifer Trusted, Routledge, 1991 {{ISBN|0-415-05948-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Surface conductivity''' is an additional [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]] of an [[electrolyte]] in the vicinity of charged surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Surface and [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|volume conductivity]] correspond to the electrically driven motion of [[ions]] in an [[electric field]].&lt;/ref&gt; Close to charged surfaces a layer of [[counter ion]]s of opposite polarity exists which is attracted by the [[surface charge]]s. This layer of higher ionic concentration is a part of the interfacial [[Double layer (interfacial)|double layer]]. The concentration of the ions in this layer is higher as compared to the [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|volume conductivity]] far from the charged surface and leads to a higher conductivity of this layer.

[[Marian Smoluchowski|Smoluchowski]] was the first to recognize the importance of surface conductivity at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;M. von Smoluchowski, Physik, Z., 6, 529 (1905)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a detailed description of surface conductivity by Lyklema in "Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science" &lt;ref&gt;Lyklema, J. "Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science", vol. 2, Academic Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The Double Layer (DL) has two regions, according to the well established Gouy-Chapman-Stern model, Ref.2. The upper level, which is in contact with the bulk fluid is the [[diffuse layer]]. The inner layer that is in contact with interface is the [[Stern layer]].

It is possible that the lateral motion of ions in both parts of the DL contributes to the surface conductivity.

The contribution of the Stern layer is less well described. It is often called "additional surface conductivity".&lt;ref&gt;Dukhin, S.S. and Derjaguin, B.V. "Electrokinetic Phenomena", John Wiley and Sons, New York (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of the surface conductivity of the diffuse part of the DL was developed by Bikerman.&lt;ref&gt;Bikerman, J.J. Z.Physik.Chem. A163, 378, 1933&lt;/ref&gt; He derived a simple equation that links surface conductivity κ&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; with the behaviour of ions at the interface. For symmetrical electrolyte and assuming identical ions diffusion coefficients D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;=D&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;=D it is given in Ref.2:

:&lt;math&gt; {\kappa}^{\sigma} = \frac{4F^2Cz^2D(1+3m/z^2)}{RT\kappa}\left(\cosh\frac{zF\zeta}{2RT}-1\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where
:F is the [[Faraday constant]]
:T is the [[absolute temperature]]
:R is the [[gas constant]]
:C is the ionic concentration in the bulk fluid
:z is the [[ion]] [[valence (chemistry)|valency]]
:ζ is the [[electrokinetic potential]]

The parameter ''m'' characterizes the contribution of [[electro-osmosis]] to the motion of ions within the DL:
:&lt;math&gt; m = \frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_m R^2T^2}{3\eta F^2 D}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Dukhin number]] is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the contribution of the surface conductivity to a variety of [[electrokinetic phenomena]], such as, [[electrophoresis]] and [[electroacoustic phenomena]].

==Surface Science==
'''Surface conductivity''' may refer to the electrical conduction across a solid surface measured by surface probes. Experiments may be done to test this material property as in the [[Extrinsic semiconductor|n-type]] surface conductivity of [[Extrinsic semiconductor|p-type]] &lt;ref&gt; W.L. Brown. "n-Type Surface Conductivity on p-Type Germanium". Phys. Rev. 91, 518 (1953). &lt;/ref&gt;. Additionally, surface conductivity is measured in coupled phenomena such as [[Photoconductivity|photoconductivity]], for example, for the metal oxide semiconductor [[Zinc oxide|ZnO]]&lt;ref&gt;Y. Shapira, S.M. Cox and David Lichtman. "CHEMISORPTION, PHOTODESORPTION AND CONDUCTIVITY
MEASUREMENTS ON ZnO SURFACES". Surface Science 54, 43 (1976). &lt;/ref&gt;. Surface conductivity differs from bulk conductivity for analogous reasons to the electrolyte solution case, where the [[Charge carrier|charge carriers]] of holes (+1) and electrons (-1) play the role of ions in solution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13373">'''Visual space''' is the [[perception|perceptual]] space housing the [[visual perception|visual]] world being experienced by an aware [[observation|observer]]; it is the subjective counterpart of the space of physical objects before an observer's eyes.

==Spaces of objects and of visual percepts==

===Space of physical objects===

In ''' object space''' the location and shape of physical targets can be accurately described with the tools of geometry. For practical purposes it is [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]]. It is three-dimensional and various co-ordinate systems like the [[Cartesian coordinates|Cartesian]] x,y,z (with a defined origin in relation to an observer's head or eyes), or [[Bipolar coordinates|bipolar]] with angles of elevation, azimuth and binocular parallax (based on the separation of the two eyes) are interchangeable. No elaborate mathematics are needed.

===Space of visual percepts===

'''Percepts''', the counterparts in the aware observer's conscious experience of objects in physical space, constitute an ordered ensemble or, as [[Ernst Cassirer]] explained,&lt;ref&gt;Cassirer, E. (1944). The concept of group and the theory of perception. ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'', 5 (1), 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt; the perceptual world has a structure and is not an aggregate of scattered sensations. This visual space can be accessed by introspection, by interrogation, or by suitable experimental procedures which allow relative location as well as some structural properties to be assessed, even quantitatively.

An example illustrates the relationship between the concepts of object and visual space:
Two straight lines are presented to an observer who is asked to set them so that they appear parallel. When this has been done, the lines ''are'' parallel in visual space and now a comparison is feasible with the physical lines' setting in object space. Good precision can be achieved using psychophysical procedures in human observers or behavioral ones in trained animals. The reciprocal experiment is easier to perform but does not yield a numerical read-out as readily: show objectively parallel lines and make a determination of their inclination in the observer's perception.

Considering how it arises (see below), visual space seems, as an immediate, unmediated experience, to provide a remarkably true and unproblematic representation of a real world of objects.

===Visual space and visual field===

The distinction is mandatory between what the eye professions call ''visual field'', the area or extent of physical space that is available to the eye or that is being imaged on the retina, and the virtual, perceptual ''visual space'' in which visual percepts are located, the subject of this entry.
Confusion is caused by the use of ''[[:de:Geschichte der Theorie des Sehens|Sehraum]]'' in the German literature for both. There is no doubt that [[Ewald Hering]] and his followers &lt;ref&gt;Tschermak, A. (1947). ''Einführung in die Physiologische Optik''. Wien: Springer-Verlag&lt;/ref&gt; meant visual space in their disquisitions.

===Spaces: formal, physical, perceptual&lt;!--Linked from 'Rudolf Carnap'--&gt;===
{{See also|Conceptual space}}
The fundamental distinction was made by [[Rudolf Carnap]] between three kinds of space which he called ''formal'', ''physical'' and ''perceptual.''&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. (1922). Der Raum. In: ''Kantstudien Ergänzungsheft'', 56&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematicians, for example, deal with ordered structures, ensembles of elements for which rules of logico-deductive relationships hold, limited solely by being not self-contradictory. These are the ''formal'' spaces. According to Carnap, studying ''physical'' space means examining the relationship between empirically determined objects. Finally, there is the realm of what students of Kant know as ''[[:de:Anschauung|Anschauungen]],'' immediate sensory experiences, often awkwardly translated as "[[apperception]]s," which belong to ''perceptual spaces.''

==Visual space and geometry==
Geometry is the discipline devoted to the study of space and the rules relating the elements to each other. For example, in Euclidean space there is the [[Pythagorean theorem]] for distances. In a two-dimensional space of constant curvature, like the surface of a sphere, the rule is somewhat more complex but applies everywhere. On the two-dimensional surface of a football, the rule is more complex still and has different values depending on location. In well-behaved spaces such rules used for measurement and called ''[[Metric (mathematics)|Metrics]],'' are classically handled by the mathematics invented by [[Riemann]]. Object space belongs to that class.

To the extent that it is reachable by scientifically acceptable probes, visual space as defined is also a candidate for such considerations. The first and remarkably prescient analysis was published by [[Ernst Mach]]&lt;ref&gt;Mach, E. (1906) ''Space and Geometry''. Open Court Publishing: Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; in 1901. Under the heading ''On Physiological as Distinguished from Geometrical Space'' Mach states that "Both spaces are threefold manifoldnesses" but the former is "...neither constituted everywhere and in all directions alike, nor infinite in extent, nor unbounded." A notable attempt at a rigorous formulation was made in 1947 by the highly talented mathematician [[Rudolf Luneburg]], who preceded his essay &lt;ref&gt;Luneburg, R.K. (1947). ''Mathematical Analysis of Binocular Vision''. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; by a profound analysis of the underlying principles. When features are sufficiently singular and distinct, there is no problem about a correspondence between an individual item ''A'' in object space and its correlate ''A' '' in visual space. Questions can be asked and answered such as "If visual percepts ''A',B',C' '' are correlates of physical objects ''A,B,C,'' and if ''C'' lies between ''A'' and ''B'', does ''C' '' lie between ''A' '' and ''B' ''?" In this manner, the possibility of visual space being metrical can be approached. If the exercise is successful, a great deal can be said about the nature of the mapping of the physical space on the visual space.

On the basis of fragmentary psychophysical data of previous generations, Luneburg concluded that visual space was hyperbolic with constant curvature, meaning that elements can be moved throughout the space without changing shape. One of Luneburg's major arguments is that, in accord with a common observation, the transformation involving hyperbolic space renders infinity into a dome (the sky). The Luneburg proposition gave rise to discussions and attempts at corroborating experiments, which on the whole did not favor it.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 3 ''Geometry and Spatial Vision''. (2006) In M.R.M. Jenkin and L.R. Harris (Eds) ''Seeing Spatial Form''. Oxford U. Press. pp 35-41&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic to the problem, and underestimated by Luneburg the mathematician, is the likely success of a mathematically viable formulation of the relationship between objects in physical space and percepts in visual space. Any scientific investigation of visual space is colored by the kind of access we have to it, and the precision, repeatability and generality of measurements. Insightful questions can be asked about the mapping of visual space to object space &lt;ref&gt;Foley, J.M. (1964). Desarguesian property in visual space. ''Journal of the Optical Society of America'', 54 (5), 684-692.&lt;/ref&gt; but answers are mostly limited in the range of their validity. If the physical setting that satisfies the criterion of, say, apparent parallelism varies from observer to observer, or from day to day, or from context to context, so does the geometrical nature of, and hence mathematical formulation for, visual space.

All these arguments notwithstanding, there is a major concordance between the locations of items in object space and their correlates in visual space. It is adequately veridical for us to navigate very effectively in the world, deviations from such a situation are sufficiently notable to warrant special consideration. [[visual space agnosia]] is a recognized neurological condition, and the many common distortions, called [[geometrical-optical illusions]], are widely demonstrated but of minor consequence.

==Neural representation of space==

===Fechner's ''inner'' and ''outer'' psychophysics ===

Its founder, [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]] defined the mission of the discipline of [[psychophysics]] as the functional relationship between the mental and material worlds—in this particular case, the visual and object spaces—but he acknowledged an intermediate step, which has since blossomed into the major enterprise of modern neuroscience. In distinguishing between ''inner'' and ''outer'' psychophysics, Fechner recognized that a physical stimulus generates a percept by way of an effect on the organism's sensory and nervous systems. Hence, without denying that its essence is the arc between object and percept, the inquiry can concern itself with the neural substrate of visual space.

===Retinotopy and beyond===

Two major concepts dating back to the middle of the 19th century set the parameters of the discussion here. [[Johannes Peter Müller|Johannes Müller]] emphasized that what matters in a neural path is the connection it makes, and Hermann [[Lotze]], from psychological considerations, enunciated the principle of local sign. Put together in modern neuroanatomical terms they mean that a nerve fiber from a fixed retinal location instructs its target neurons in the brain about the presence of a stimulus in the location in the eye's visual field that is imaged there. The orderly array of retinal locations is preserved in the passage from the retina to the brain, and provides what is aptly called a "[[Retinotopy|retinotopic"]] mapping in the primary visual cortex. Thus in the first instance brain activity retains the relative spatial ordering of the objects and lays the foundations for a neural substrate of visual space. Unfortunately, as is so common in brain studies, simplicity and transparency ends here. Right at the outset, visual signals are analyzed not only for their position, but also, separately in parallel channels, for many other attributes such as brightness, color, orientation, depth. No single neuron or even neuronal center or circuit represents both the nature of a target feature and its accurate location. The unitary mapping of object space into the coherent visual space without internal contradictions or inconsistencies that we as observer automatically experience, demands concepts of conjoint activity in several parts of the nervous system that is at present beyond the reach of neurophysiological research.

===Place cells===

Though the details of the process by which the experience of visual space emerges remain opaque, a startling finding gives hope for future insights. Neural units have been demonstrated in the brain structure called [[hippocampus]] that show activity only when the animal is in a specific place in its environment{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}.

==Space and its content==
Only on an astronomical scale are physical space and its contents interdependent, This major proposition of the [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]] is of no concern in vision. For us, distances in object space are independent of the nature of the objects.

But this is not so simple in visual space. At a minim an observer judges the relative location of a few light points in an otherwise dark visual field, a simplistic extension from object space that enabled Luneburg to make some statements about the geometry of visual space. In a more richly textured visual world, the various visual percepts carry with them prior perceptual associations which often affect their relative spatial disposition. Identical separations in physical space can look quite different (''are quite different'' in visual space) depending on the features that demarcate them. This is particularly so in the depth dimension because the apparatus by which values in the third visual dimension are assigned is fundamentally different from that for the height and width of objects.

Even in monocular vision, which physiologically has only two dimensions, cues of size, perspective, relative motion etc. are used to [[Monocular depth cues|assign depth differences to percepts]]. Looked at as a mathematical/geometrical problem, expanding a 2-dimensional object manifold into a 3-dimensional visual world is "ill-posed," i.e., not capable of a rational solution, but is accomplished quite effectively by the human observer.

The problem becomes less ill-posed when [[binocular vision]] allows actual determination of relative depth by [[stereoscopy]], but its linkage to the evaluation of distance in the other two dimensions is uncertain (see: [[stereoscopic depth rendition]]). Hence, the uncomplicated three-dimensional visual space of every-day experience is the product of many perceptual and cognitive layers superimposed on the physiological representation of the physical world of objects.

A '''wormhole''' (or '''Einstein–Rosen bridge''') is a speculative structure linking separate points in [[spacetime]], and is based on a [[Solutions of the Einstein field equations|solution of the Einstein field equations]]. A wormhole can be visualized as a tunnel with two ends, each at separate points in spacetime (i.e., different locations or different points of time). More precisely it is a transcendental bijection of the spacetime continuum, an asymptotic projection of the [[Calabi–Yau]] manifold manifesting itself in [[Anti-de Sitter space]]. 

Wormholes are consistent with the [[general theory of relativity]], but whether wormholes actually exist remains to be seen.

A wormhole could connect extremely long distances such as a billion [[light year]]s or more, short distances such as a few [[meter]]s, different [[multiverse|universes]], or different points in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1998-08-03|title=Focus: Wormhole Construction: Proceed with Caution|url=https://physics.aps.org/story/v2/st7|journal=Physics|language=en-US|volume=2|pages=|via=American Physical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visualization ==
[[File:Wormhole-demo.png|thumb|Wormhole visualized]]
For a simplified notion of a wormhole, [[space]] can be visualized as a two-dimensional (2D) surface. In this case, a wormhole would appear as a hole in that surface, lead into a [[Three-dimensional space (mathematics)|3D]] tube (the inside surface of a [[cylinder]]), then re-emerge at another location on the 2D surface with a hole similar to the entrance. An actual wormhole would be analogous to this, but with the spatial dimensions raised by one. For example, instead of circular holes on a [[2D plane]], the entry and exit points could be visualized as spheres in [[3D space]].

Another way to imagine wormholes is to take a sheet of paper and draw two somewhat distant points on one side of the paper. The sheet of paper represents a plane in the [[Spacetime|spacetime continuum]], and the two points represent a distance to be traveled, however theoretically a wormhole could connect these two points by folding that plane so the points are touching. In this way it would be much easier to traverse the distance since the two points are now touching.


== Terminology ==
In 1928, [[Hermann Weyl]] proposed a wormhole hypothesis of matter in connection with mass analysis of [[electromagnetic field]] energy;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weyl | first1 = H. | title = Feld und Materie | doi = 10.1002/andp.19213701405 | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 65 | issue = 14| year = 1921 | pages=541–563| bibcode = 1921AnP...370..541W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scholz, Erhard  (ed.), ''Hermann Weyl's Raum - Zeit - Materie and a General Introduction to His Scientific Work'', 2001, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; however, he did not use the term "wormhole" (he spoke of "one-dimensional tubes" instead).&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weyl/ "Hermann Weyl"]: entry in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

American [[theoretical physicist]] [[John Archibald Wheeler]] (inspired by Weyl's work)&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; coined the term "wormhole" in a 1957 paper co-authored by [[Charles Misner]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Misner | first1 = C.

{{quote|This analysis forces one to consider situations... where there is a net flux of lines of force, through what [[topologist]]s would call "a [[Handle decomposition|handle]]" of the multiply-connected space, and what physicists might perhaps be excused for more vividly terming a "wormhole".|Charles Misner and John Wheeler in ''[[Annals of Physics]]''}}

=== Modern definitions ===
Wormholes have been defined both [[Geometry and topology|''geometrically'' and ''topologically'']].{{elucidate|are these definitions equivalent?|date=March 2017}} From a topological point of view, an intra-universe wormhole (a wormhole between two points in the same universe) is a [[Compact space|compact]] region of spacetime whose boundary is topologically trivial, but whose interior is not [[simply connected]]. Formalizing this idea leads to definitions such as the following, taken from [[Matt Visser]]'s ''Lorentzian Wormholes'' (1996).&lt;ref name="Visser1996" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2018}}

{{quote|If a [[Minkowski space]]time contains a compact region Ω, and if the topology of Ω is of the form Ω ~ R × Σ, where Σ is a three-manifold of the nontrivial topology, whose boundary has topology of the form ∂Σ ~ S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and if, furthermore, the [[hypersurface]]s Σ are all spacelike, then the region Ω contains a quasipermanent intrauniverse wormhole.}}

Geometrically, wormholes can be described as regions of spacetime that constrain the incremental deformation of closed surfaces. For example, in Enrico Rodrigo's ''The Physics of Stargates, ''a wormhole is defined informally as: {{quote|a region of spacetime containing a "[[world tube]]" (the time evolution of a closed surface) that cannot be continuously deformed (shrunk) to a [[world line]] (the time evolution of a point).}}

The equations of the theory of [[general relativity]] have valid solutions that contain wormholes.

Wormholes that could be crossed in both directions, known as [[Wormhole#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormholes]], would only be possible if [[exotic matter]] with negative [[energy density]] could be used to stabilize them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[File:FY221c15.png|thumb|An artist's impression of a wormhole from an observer's perspective, crossing the [[event horizon]] of a Schwarzschild wormhole that bridges two different universes. The observer originates from the right, and another universe becomes visible in the center of the wormhole's shadow once the horizon is crossed, the observer seeing light that has fallen into the [[black hole]] interior region from the other universe; however, this other universe is unreachable in the case of a Schwarzschild wormhole, as the bridge always collapses before the observer has time to cross it, and everything that has fallen through the event horizon of either universe is inevitably crushed in the [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]].]]

Schwarzschild wormholes, also known as ''Einstein–Rosen bridges''&lt;ref name=Dobrev/&gt; (named after [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Nathan Rosen]]),&lt;ref name=ER/&gt; are connections between areas of space that can be modeled as [[vacuum solution]]s to the [[Einstein field equations]], and that are now understood to be intrinsic parts of the [[Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates#The maximally extended Schwarzschild solution|maximally extended]] version of the [[Schwarzschild metric]] describing an eternal black hole with no charge and no rotation. Here, "maximally extended" refers to the idea that the [[spacetime]] should not have any "edges": it should be possible to continue this path arbitrarily far into the particle's future or past for any possible trajectory of a free-falling particle (following a [[geodesic]] in the spacetime).

In order to satisfy this requirement, it turns out that in addition to the black hole interior region that particles enter when they fall through the [[event horizon]] from the outside, there must be a separate [[white hole]] interior region that allows us to extrapolate the trajectories of particles that an outside observer sees rising up ''away'' from the event horizon. And just as there are two separate interior regions of the maximally extended spacetime, there are also two separate exterior regions, sometimes called two different "universes", with the second universe allowing us to extrapolate some possible particle trajectories in the two interior regions. This means that the interior black hole region can contain a mix of particles that fell in from either universe (and thus an observer who fell in from one universe might be able to see light that fell in from the other one), and likewise particles from the interior white hole region can escape into either universe. All four regions can be seen in a spacetime diagram that uses [[Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates]].

In this spacetime, it is possible to come up with [[coordinate system]]s such that if a [[hypersurface]] of constant time (a set of points that all have the same time coordinate, such that every point on the surface has a [[space-like]] separation, giving what is called a 'space-like surface') is picked and an "embedding diagram" drawn depicting the curvature of space at that time, the embedding diagram will look like a tube connecting the two exterior regions, known as an "Einstein&amp;ndash;Rosen bridge". Note that the Schwarzschild metric describes an idealized black hole that exists eternally from the perspective of external observers; a more realistic black hole that forms at some particular time from a collapsing star would require a different metric. When the infalling stellar matter is added to a diagram of a black hole's history, it removes the part of the diagram corresponding to the white hole interior region, along with the part of the diagram corresponding to the other universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/collapse.html#kruskal |title=Collapse to a Black Hole |publisher=Casa.colorado.edu |date=2010-10-03 |accessdate=2010-11-11}}{{tertiary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Einstein&amp;ndash;Rosen bridge was discovered by [[Ludwig Flamm]] in 1916,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flamm|title=Beiträge zur Einsteinschen Gravitationstheorie|date=1916|journal=[[Physikalische Zeitschrift]]|volume=XVII|page=448}} ("Comments on Einstein's Theory of Gravity")&lt;/ref&gt; a few months after Schwarzschild published his solution, and was rediscovered by Albert Einstein and his colleague Nathan Rosen, who published their result in 1935.&lt;ref name=ER&gt;A.

Fuller]] published a paper&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Fuller and J. A. Wheeler, "Causality and Multiply-Connected Space-Time," ''Phys. Rev.'' '''128'''(919) (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; showing that this type of wormhole is unstable if it connects two parts of the same universe, and that it will pinch off too quickly for light (or any particle moving slower than light) that falls in from one exterior region to make it to the other exterior region.

According to general relativity, the [[gravitational collapse]] of a sufficiently compact mass forms a singular Schwarzschild black hole. In the [[Einstein–Cartan theory|Einstein–Cartan]]–Sciama–Kibble theory of gravity, however, it forms a regular Einstein–Rosen bridge. This theory extends general relativity by removing a constraint of the symmetry of the [[affine connection]] and regarding its antisymmetric part, the [[torsion tensor]], as a dynamical variable. Torsion naturally accounts for the quantum-mechanical, intrinsic angular momentum ([[spin (physics)|spin]]) of matter. The minimal coupling between torsion and [[Dirac spinor]]s generates a repulsive spin–spin interaction that is significant in fermionic matter at extremely high densities. Such an interaction prevents the formation of a gravitational singularity.{{clarify|date=April 2015}} Instead, the collapsing matter reaches an enormous but finite density and rebounds, forming the other side of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poplawski, Nikodem J. |authorlink=Nikodem Popławski |year=2010 |title=Cosmology with torsion: An alternative to cosmic inflation |journal=Phys.

Although Schwarzschild wormholes are not traversable in both directions, their existence inspired [[Kip Thorne]] to imagine traversable wormholes created by holding the "throat" of a Schwarzschild wormhole open with [[exotic matter]] (material that has negative mass/energy).

Ellis thoroughly analyzed the topology and the [[geodesic]]s of the [[Ellis drainhole]], showing it to be geodesically complete, horizonless, singularity-free, and fully traversable in both directions.  The drainhole is a solution manifold of Einstein's field equations for a vacuum space-time, modified by inclusion of a scalar field minimally coupled to the [[Ricci tensor]] with antiorthodox polarity (negative instead of positive).  (Ellis specifically rejected referring to the scalar field as 'exotic' because of the antiorthodox coupling, finding arguments for doing so unpersuasive.)  The solution depends on two parameters: &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, which fixes the strength of its gravitational field, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, which determines the curvature of its spatial cross sections.  When &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is set equal to 0, the drainhole's gravitational field vanishes.  What is left is the [[Ellis wormhole]], a nongravitating, purely geometric, traversable wormhole.
[[Kip Thorne]] and his graduate student [[Mike Morris (physicist)|Mike Morris]], unaware of the 1973 papers by Ellis and Bronnikov,  manufactured, and in 1988 published, a duplicate of the Ellis wormhole for use as a tool for teaching general relativity. For this reason, the type of traversable wormhole they proposed, held open by a spherical shell of [[exotic matter]], was from 1988 to 2015 exclusively referred to in the literature as a ''Morris–Thorne wormhole''. Later, other types of traversable wormholes were discovered as allowable solutions to the equations of general relativity, including a variety analyzed in a 1989 paper by [[Matt Visser]], in which a path through the wormhole can be made where the traversing path does not pass through a region of exotic matter. However, in the pure [[Gauss–Bonnet gravity]] (a modification to general relativity involving extra spatial dimensions which is sometimes studied in the context of [[brane cosmology]]) exotic matter is not needed in order for wormholes to exist—they can exist even with no matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Elias Gravanis|author2=Steven Willison|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.75.084025|year=2007|title='Mass without mass' from thin shells in Gauss-Bonnet gravity|issue=8|pages=084025|volume=75|journal=Phys.

Cramer|Cramer]] ''et al.'',&lt;ref name="naturalwormholes"/&gt; in which it was proposed that such wormholes could have been naturally created in the early universe.

Wormholes connect two points in spacetime, which means that they would in principle allow [[time travel|travel in time]], as well as in space. In 1988, Morris, Thorne and Yurtsever worked out explicitly how to convert a wormhole traversing space into one traversing time by accelerating one of its two mouths.&lt;ref name="time travel"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.1446|title=Wormholes, Time Machines, and the Weak Energy Condition|date=1988|last1=Morris|first1=Michael|last2=Thorne|first2=Kip|last3=Yurtsever|first3=Ulvi|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=61|issue=13|pages=1446–1449|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/9262/1/MORprl88.pdf|pmid=10038800|bibcode=1988PhRvL..61.1446M}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to general relativity, it would not be possible to use a wormhole to travel back to a time earlier than when the wormhole was first converted into a time 'machine'. Until this time it could not have been noticed or have been used.&lt;ref name="Thorne1994" /&gt;{{Rp|504}}

== Raychaudhuri's theorem and exotic matter ==
To see why [[exotic matter]] is required, consider an incoming light front traveling along geodesics, which then crosses the wormhole and re-expands on the other side. The [[congruence (general relativity)|expansion]] goes from negative to positive. As the wormhole neck is of finite size, we would not expect caustics to develop, at least within the vicinity of the neck. According to the optical [[Raychaudhuri's theorem]], this requires a violation of the [[averaged null energy condition]]. Quantum effects such as the [[Casimir effect]] cannot violate the averaged null energy condition in any neighborhood of space with zero curvature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fewster|first=Christopher J.|author2=Ken D.

==Modified general relativity==
In some hypotheses where [[Alternatives to general relativity|general relativity is modified]], it is possible to have a wormhole that does not collapse without having to resort to exotic matter. For example, this is possible with R^2 gravity, a form of [[f(R) gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1506.00988|title=Exotica ex nihilo: Traversable wormholes &amp; non-singular black holes from the vacuum of quadratic gravity|journal=Physical Review D|volume=92|issue=4|pages=043516|last1=Duplessis|first1=Francis|last2= Easson|first2=Damien A.|year=2015|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.92.043516|bibcode=2015PhRvD..92d3516D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impossibility of faster-than-light relative speed only applies locally. Wormholes might allow effective superluminal ([[faster-than-light]]) travel by ensuring that the speed of light is not exceeded locally at any time. While traveling through a wormhole, subluminal (slower-than-light) speeds are used. If two points are connected by a wormhole whose length is shorter than the distance between them ''outside'' the wormhole, the time taken to traverse it could be less than the time it would take a light beam to make the journey if it took a path through the space ''outside'' the wormhole. However, a light beam traveling through the same wormhole would of course beat the traveler.

If [[#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormholes]] exist, they could allow [[time travel]].&lt;ref name="time travel"/&gt; A proposed time-travel machine using a traversable wormhole would hypothetically work in the following way: One end of the wormhole is accelerated to some significant fraction of the speed of light, perhaps with some advanced [[Vehicle propulsion|propulsion system]], and then brought back to the point of origin. Alternatively, another way is to take one entrance of the wormhole and move it to within the gravitational field of an object that has higher gravity than the other entrance, and then return it to a position near the other entrance. For both of these methods, [[time dilation]] causes the end of the wormhole that has been moved to have aged less, or become "younger", than the stationary end as seen by an external observer; however, time connects differently ''through'' the wormhole than ''outside'' it, so that [[Synchronization|synchronized]] clocks at either end of the wormhole will always remain synchronized as seen by an observer passing through the wormhole, no matter how the two ends move around.&lt;ref name="Thorne1994"&gt;{{cite book | last = Thorne | first = Kip S. | authorlink = Kip Thorne | title = Black Holes and Time Warps | publisher = W. W. Norton | year= 1994 | isbn = 978-0-393-31276-8| title-link = Black Holes and Time Warps }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|502}} This means that an observer entering the "younger" end would exit the "older" end at a time when it was the same age as the "younger" end, effectively going back in time as seen by an observer from the outside. One significant limitation of such a time machine is that it is only possible to go as far back in time as the initial creation of the machine;&lt;ref name="Thorne1994" /&gt;{{rp|503}} It is more of a path through time rather than it is a device that itself moves through time, and it would not allow the technology itself to be moved backward in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=gr-qc/0503097|title=Wormholes and Time Travel?

According to current theories on the nature of wormholes, construction of a traversable wormhole would require the existence of a substance with negative energy, often referred to as "[[exotic matter]]". More technically, the wormhole spacetime requires a distribution of energy that violates various [[energy condition]]s, such as the null energy condition along with the weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions. However, it is known that quantum effects can lead to small measurable violations of the null energy condition,&lt;ref name="Visser1996"&gt;{{cite book | last = Visser | first = Matt | authorlink = Matt Visser | title = Lorentzian Wormholes | publisher = Springer-Verlag | year= 1996 | isbn = 978-1-56396-653-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|101}} and many physicists believe that the required negative energy may actually be possible due to the [[Casimir effect]] in quantum physics.&lt;ref name="casimir"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npl.washington.edu/av/altvw69.html |title=NASA Goes FTL Part 1: Wormhole Physics |website=Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact Magazine|year=1994|accessdate=December 2, 2006|last1=Cramer|first1=John G. |authorlink=John G.

In 1993, [[Matt Visser]] argued that the two mouths of a wormhole with such an induced clock difference could not be brought together without inducing quantum field and gravitational effects that would either make the wormhole collapse or the two mouths repel each other,&lt;ref name="visser_1"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Matt | last = Visser | authorlink = Matt Visser | title = From wormhole to time machine: Comments on Hawking's Chronology Protection Conjecture | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 47 | year = 1993 | issue = 2 | pages = 554–565 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.47.554| arxiv=hep-th/9202090|bibcode = 1993PhRvD..47..554V }}&lt;/ref&gt; or otherwise prevent information from passing through the wormhole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=gr-qc/0204022|title=The quantum physics of chronology protection|last1=Visser|first1=Matt|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the two mouths could not be brought close enough for [[causality (physics)|causality]] violation to take place. However, in a 1997 paper, Visser hypothesized that a complex "[[Roman ring]]" (named after Tom Roman) configuration of an N number of wormholes arranged in a symmetric polygon could still act as a time machine, although he concludes that this is more likely a flaw in classical quantum gravity theory rather than proof that causality violation is possible.&lt;ref name="visser_2"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Matt | last = Visser | authorlink = Matt Visser | title = Traversable wormholes: the Roman ring | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 55 | year = 1997 | issue = 8 | pages = 5212–5214 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.55.5212| arxiv=gr-qc/9702043|bibcode = 1997PhRvD..55.5212V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interuniversal travel&lt;!--'Interuniversal travel', 'Inter-universal travel' and 'Everett phone' redirect here--&gt; ==
A possible resolution to the paradoxes resulting from wormhole-enabled time travel rests on the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]].

In 1991 [[David Deutsch]] showed that quantum theory is fully consistent (in the sense that the so-called [[density matrix]] can be made free of discontinuities) in spacetimes with closed timelike curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=David |title=Quantum Mechanics Near Closed Timelike Lines|date=1991|journal=[[Physical Review D]]|volume=44|issue=10|page=3197|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevD.44.3197|bibcode=1991PhRvD..44.3197D}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later it was shown that such model of closed timelike curve can have internal inconsistencies as it will lead to strange phenomena like distinguishing non-orthogonal quantum states and distinguishing proper and improper mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Brun|display-authors=etal |title=Localized Closed Timelike Curves Can Perfectly Distinguish Quantum States|date=2009|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=102|issue=21|page=210402|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.210402|bibcode=2009PhRvL.102u0402B|pmid=19519086|arxiv=0811.1209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pati |author2=Chakrabarty|author3=Agrawal|title=Purification of mixed states with closed timelike curve is not possible|date=2011|journal=[[Physical Review A]]|volume=84|issue=6|page=062325|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevA.84.062325|bibcode = 2011PhRvA..84f2325P |arxiv = 1003.4221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the destructive positive feedback loop of virtual particles circulating through a wormhole time machine, a result indicated by semi-classical calculations, is averted. A particle returning from the future does not return to its universe of origination but to a parallel universe. This suggests that a wormhole time machine with an exceedingly short time jump is a theoretical bridge between contemporaneous parallel universes.&lt;ref name="Rodrigo2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodrigo|first=Enrico|title=The Physics of Stargates|publisher=Eridanus Press|date= 2010|page=281|isbn= 978-0-9841500-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because a wormhole time-machine introduces a type of nonlinearity into quantum theory, this sort of communication between parallel universes is consistent with [[Joseph Polchinski]]'s proposal of an '''Everett phone'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Polchinski|first=Joseph |title=Weinberg's Nonlinear quantum Mechanics and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=66|issue=4|pages=397–400 |date=1991 |bibcode=1991PhRvL..66..397P|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.66.397 |pmid=10043797}}&lt;/ref&gt; (named after [[Hugh Everett III|Hugh Everett]]) in [[Steven Weinberg]]'s formulation of nonlinear quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Rodrigo, ''The Physics of Stargates: Parallel Universes, Time Travel, and the Enigma of Wormhole Physics'', Eridanus Press, 2010, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility of communication between parallel universes has been dubbed '''interuniversal travel'''.&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Walker, [https://www.newscientist.com/letter/mg23331111-100-14-interuniversal-travel-i-wouldnt-start-from-here/ "Inter-universal travel: I wouldn't start from here], ''[[New Scientist]]'' (1 February 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metrics ==
Theories of ''wormhole metrics'' describe the spacetime geometry of a wormhole and serve as theoretical models for time travel. An example of a (traversable) wormhole [[metric tensor|metric]] is the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Raine |first1=Derek |last2=Thomas |first2=Edwin |date=2009 |title= Black Holes: An Introduction |publisher=Imperial College Press |page=143 |isbn=978-1-84816-383-6 | edition=2nd|doi=10.1142/p637 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2= - c^2 dt^2 + dl^2 + (k^2 + l^2)(d \theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2),&lt;/math&gt;

first presented by Ellis (see [[Ellis wormhole]]) as a special case of the [[Ellis drainhole]].

One type of non-traversable wormhole [[metric tensor|metric]] is the [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild solution]] (see the first diagram):

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2= - c^2 \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)dt^2 + \frac{dr^2}{1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}} + r^2(d \theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2).&lt;/math&gt;

The original Einstein–Rosen bridge was described in an article published in July 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einstein|first1=A.|last2=Rosen|first2=N.|title=The Particle Problem in the General Theory of Relativity|journal=Physical Review|date=1 July 1935|volume=48|issue=1|pages=73–77|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.48.73|bibcode = 1935PhRv...48...73E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBPpRqxY8Uw|title=Leonard Susskind {{!}} 'ER = EPR' or 'What's Behind the Horizons of Black Holes?'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Schwarzschild spherically symmetric static solution 
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = - \frac{1}{1 - \frac{2m}{r}} dr^2 - r^2(d\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2) + (1 - \frac{2m}{r})dt^2&lt;/math&gt;
(&lt;math&gt;ds&lt;/math&gt; = proper time, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; = 1)

If one replaces &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; according to
&lt;math&gt;u^2 = r - 2m&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = -4(u^2 + 2m)du^2 - (u^2 + 2m)^2(d\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2) + \frac{u^2}{u^2 + 2m} dt^2&lt;/math&gt;

{{Quote|text=The four-dimensional space is described mathematically by two congruent parts or "sheets", corresponding to &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; &gt; 0 and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; &lt; 0, which are joined by a hyperplane &lt;math&gt;r = 2m&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; = 0 in which &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; vanishes. We call such a connection between the two sheets a "bridge".|author=A. Einstein, N. Rosen, "The Particle Problem in the General Theory of Relativity"}}

For the combined field, gravity and electricity, Einstein and Rosen derived the following Schwarzschild static spherically symmetric solution
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{1} = \phi_{2} = \phi_{3} = 0, \phi_{4} = \frac{\epsilon}{4},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = - \frac{1}{( 1 - \frac{2m}{r} - \frac{\epsilon^2}{2 r^2})} dr^2 - r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2) +
(1 - \frac{2m}{r} - \frac{\epsilon^2}{2 r^2}) dt^2&lt;/math&gt;
(&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; = electrical charge)

The field equations without denominators in the case when &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; = 0 can be written
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{\mu \nu} = \phi_{\mu,\nu} - \phi_{\nu,\mu}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g^2 \phi_{\mu\nu;\sigma}g^{\nu\sigma} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g^2 (R_{ik} + \phi_{i\alpha}\phi_{k}^{\alpha} - \frac{1}{4} g_{ik} \phi_{\alpha\beta}\phi^{ab}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

In order to eliminate singularities, if one replaces &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; according to the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;u^2 = r^2 - \frac{\epsilon^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; = 0 one obtains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/09/150903081506.htm|title=Magnetic wormhole connecting two regions of space created for the first time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uab.cat/web/newsroom/news-detail/magnetic-wormhole-created-for-first-time-1345668003610.html?noticiaid=1345689132054|title=Magnetic wormhole created for first time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{1} = \phi_{2} = \phi_{3} = 0,  \phi_{4} = \epsilon / (u^2 + \frac{\epsilon^2}{2})^\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = - du^2 - (u^2 + \frac{\epsilon^2}{2})(d \theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2) + (\frac{2 u^2}{2 u^2 + \epsilon^2})dt^2&lt;/math&gt;
