'''Affective labor''' is [[Labour (economics)|work]] carried out that is intended to produce or modify emotional experiences in people. Coming out of [[Autonomist]] [[Feminist economics|feminist]] critiques of marginalized and so-called "invisible" labor, it has been the focus of critical discussions by, e.g., [[Antonio Negri]], [[Michael Hardt]], Juan Martin Prada, and [[Michael Betancourt]].

Although its history is as old as that of [[Labour (economics)|labor]] itself, affective labor has been of increasing importance to modern [[economies]] since the emergence of [[mass culture]] in the nineteenth century.  The most visible institutionalized form of affective labor is perhaps [[advertising]], which typically attempts to make audiences relate to products through particular effects.  Yet there are many other areas in which affective labor figures prominently, including [[service industry|service and care industries]] whose purpose is to make people feel in particular ways. [[Domestic worker|Domestic work]], frequently ignored by other analysts of labor, has also been a critical focus of theories of affective labor.&lt;ref&gt;Federici, Silvia (2004) Caliban and the Witch: Women, the Body, and Primitive Accumulation. Brooklyn, NY: Autonomedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The phrase affective labor, seen broadly, has its roots in the [[Autonomist]] critiques of the 1970s, in particular those that theorize a dynamic form of capitalism that is able to move away from purely industrial labor. In particular, the "Fragment on Machines," from Marx's ''[[Grundrisse]]'', and conceptions of [[immaterial labor]] decentered the focus of labor theory and sparked debate over what constituted real labor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No longer does the worker insert a modified natural thing (Naturgegenstand) as middle link between the object (Objekt) and himself; rather, he inserts the process of nature, transformed into an industrial process, as a means between himself and inorganic nature, mastering it. He steps to the side of the production process instead of being its chief actor. In this transformation, it is neither the direct human labour he himself performs, nor the time during which he works, but rather the appropriation of his own general productive power, his understanding of nature and his mastery over it by virtue of his presence as a social body – it is, in a word, the development of the social individual which appears as the great foundation-stone of production and of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. ''The Grundrisse.'' Accessed Online at: http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Meanwhile, movements such as [[Selma James]] and Marirosa Dalla Costa's [[Wages for housework]] campaign attempted to activate the most exploited and invisible sectors of the economy and challenge the typical, male and industrial focus of labor studies.

==Hardt and Negri==

[[Antonio Negri]] and [[Michael Hardt]] have begun to develop this concept in their books [[Empire (Negri and Hardt book)|''Empire'']]&lt;ref&gt;Hardt, M. and Negri, A. (2000) ''Empire''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire]]''.&lt;ref name=Multitude&gt;Hardt, M. and Negri, A. (2004) ''Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire''. New York: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their recent work, Hardt and Negri focus on the role affective labor plays in the current mode of production (which can be referred to as "imperial", "late capitalist", or "postmodern").  In this passage from ''Multitude'' they briefly define their key terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Unlike emotions, which are mental phenomena, affects refer equally to body and mind.  In fact, affects, such as joy and sadness, reveal the present state of life in the entire organism, expressing a certain state of the body along with a certain mode of thinking.  Affective labor, then, is labor that produces or manipulates affects.... One can recognize affective labor, for example, in the work of legal assistants, flight attendants, and fast food workers (service with a smile). One indication of the rising importance of affective labor, at least in the dominant countries, is the tendency for employers to highlight education, attitude, character, and "prosocial" behavior as the primary skills employees need.  A worker with a good attitude and social skills is another way of saying a worker is adept at affective labor."&lt;ref name=Multitude/&gt;{{rp|108}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The most important point in their scholarship with respect to this issue is that immaterial labor, of which affective labor is a specific form, has achieved dominance in the current mode of production. This does not mean that there are more immaterial laborers than material laborers, or that immaterial labor produces more capital than material labor.  Instead, this dominance is signaled by the fact that, in developed countries, labor is more often figured as immaterial than material.  To illustrate the significance of this claim, they draw a comparison between the early twenty-first century and that of the mid-nineteenth century, famously engaged by [[Karl Marx]], in which factory labor was dominant even if it was not the form of labor practiced by the most people.  One popular, albeit slightly less than perfect example, of this might be that, whereas [[Fred Flintstone]], as an average American, drove a crane in a quarry, [[Homer Simpson]] sits at a desk and provides safety.

==Role in the political economy==

[[Michael Betancourt]] has suggested that affective labor may have a role in the development and maintenance of what he has termed "[[agnotology|agnotologic capitalism]]". His point is that affective labor is a symptom of the disassociation between the reality of capitalist economy and the alienation it produces:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The affective labor created to address this alienation is part of the mechanisms where the agnotological order maintains its grip on the social: managing the emotional states of the consumers, who also serve as the labor reserve, is a necessary precondition for the effective management of the quality and range of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=652 |title=Michael Betancourt, "Immaterial Value and Scarcity in Digital Capitalism", CTheory, Theory Beyond the Codes: tbc002, Date Published: 6/10/2010, Arthur and Marilouise Kroker, Editors}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His construction of affective labor is concerned with its role as an enabler for a larger capitalist superstructure, where the reduction of alienation is a precondition for the elimination of dissent. Affective labor is part of a larger activity where the population is distracted by affective pursuits and fantasies of economic advancement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16506">The '''American system of manufacturing''' was a set of [[manufacturing]] methods that evolved in the 19th century. The two notable features were the extensive use of  [[interchangeable parts]] and [[mechanization]] for production, which resulted in more efficient use of labor compared to hand methods. The system was also known as '''armory practice''' because it was first fully developed in [[armory (military)|armories]], namely, the United States Armories at [[Springfield Armory|Springfield]] in [[Massachusetts]] and [[Harpers Ferry Armory|Harpers Ferry]] in [[Virginia]] (later [[West Virginia]]),&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[inside contracting|inside contractors]] to supply the [[United States Armed Forces]], and various private armories.  The name "American system" came not from any aspect of the system that is unique to the American national character, but simply from the fact that for a time in the 19th century it was strongly associated with the American companies who first successfully implemented it, and how their methods contrasted (at that time) with those of British and continental European companies. In the 1850s, the "American system" was contrasted to the British [[factory system]] which had evolved over the previous century. Within a few decades, manufacturing technology had evolved further, and the ideas behind the "American" system were in use worldwide. Therefore, in manufacturing today, which is global in the scope of its methods, there is no longer any such distinction.

The American system involved semi-skilled labor using [[machine tool]]s and [[jig (tool)|jigs]] to make standardized, identical, [[interchangeable parts]], manufactured to a [[tolerance (engineering)|tolerance]], which could be assembled with a minimum of time and skill, requiring little to no [[wikt:fit#Verb|fitting]].

Since the parts are interchangeable, it was also possible to separate manufacture from assembly, and repair—an example of the [[division of labor]]. This meant that all three functions could be carried out by semi-skilled labor: manufacture in smaller factories up the supply chain, assembly on an [[assembly line]] in a main factory, and repair in small specialized shops or in the field. The result is that more things could be made, more cheaply, and with higher quality, and those things also could be distributed further, and lasted longer, because repairs were also easier and cheaper. In the case of each function, the system of interchangeable parts typically involved substituting specialized machinery to replace hand tools.

Interchangeability of parts was finally achieved by combining a number of innovations and improvements in machining operations and [[machine tools]], which were developed primarily for making textile machinery. These innovations included the invention of new machine tools and jigs (in both cases, for guiding the [[cutting tool (machining)|cutting tool]]), fixtures for holding the work in the proper position, and blocks and gauges to check the accuracy of the finished parts.&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984" /&gt;

==Use of machinery==
English machine tool manufacturer [[Joseph Whitworth]] was appointed as a British commissioner for the New York International Exhibition. Accompanied by another British commissioner, he traveled around several states visiting various manufacturers, and as a result published a highly influential report on American manufacturing, from which he is quoted:

{{quote| The laboring classes are comparatively few in number, but this is counterbalanced by, and indeed, may be one of the causes of the eagerness by which they call in the use of machinery in almost every department of industry. Wherever it can be applied as a substitute for manual labor, it is universally and willingly resorted to….  It is this condition of the labor market, and this eager resort to machinery wherever it can be applied, to which, under the guidance of superior education and intelligence, the remarkable prosperity of the United States is due.&lt;ref&gt;{{Roe1916}}. {{Citation | title = Report of the British Commissioners to the New York Industrial Exhibition | place = London | year = 1854}}.&lt;/ref&gt; | Joseph Whitworth, 1854}}

==Other characteristics==
The American system contributed to efficiency gains through division of labor. Division of labor helped manufacturing transition from small artisan's shops to early factories. Key pieces of evidence supporting efficiency gains include increase in firm size, evidence of returns to scale, and an increase in non-specialized labor. The need for firms to train uneducated people to perform only one thing in the productivity chain allowed for the use of non-specialized labor. Women and children were employed more frequently within larger firms, especially those producing furniture and clothing.{{Citation needed |date=July 2015}}.

==History==
In the late 18th century, [[France|French]] General [[Jean Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval]] suggested that [[musket]]s could be manufactured faster and more economically if they were made from interchangeable parts. This system would also make field repairs easier to carry out under battle conditions. He provided patronage to [[Honoré Blanc]], who attempted to implement the [[Gribeauval system|''Système Gribeauval'']], but never succeeded.&lt;ref name = "hounshell-1984" /&gt; Until then, under the British [[factory system]], skilled machinists were required to produce parts from a design.  But however skilled the machinist, parts were never identical, and each part had to be manufactured separately to fit its counterpart—almost always by one person who produced each completed item from start to finish.

Mass production using interchangeable parts was first achieved in 1803 by [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] in cooperation with [[Henry Maudslay]], and Simon Goodrich, under the management of (with contributions by) Brigadier-General Sir [[Samuel Bentham]], the Inspector General of Naval Works at [[Portsmouth Block Mills]] at [[Portsmouth Dockyard]], for the British Royal Navy during the Napoleonic War. By 1808 annual production had reached 130,000 [[Block (sailing)|sailing blocks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Enlightenment &amp; measurement |publisher=Making the modern world |url=http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/stories/enlightenment_and_measurement/05.ST.02/?scene=3&amp;tv=true |place=[[United Kingdom|UK]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Portsmouth dockyard | place =UK |url=http://www.portsmouthdockyard.org.uk/Page%206.htm}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |contribution=Block |title=Collections |publisher=Science museum |contribution-url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/collections/exhiblets/block/ |place=UK | type = exhiblet}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Gilbert |first=KR |title=The Portsmouth Block-making Machinery |place=London |year=1965}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cooper |first=CC |title= The Production Line at Portsmouth Block Mill | journal=Industrial Archaeology Review |volume=VI |year=1982 |pages=28–44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cooper |first=CC |title=The Portsmouth System of Manufacture |journal=Technology and Culture |volume=25 |year = 1984 | pages =182–225}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Coad |first=Jonathan |title=The Royal Dockyards 1690–1850 |place=Aldershot |year=1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Coad |first=Jonathan | title =The Portsmouth Block Mills : Bentham, Brunel and the start of the Royal Navy's Industrial Revolution |year=2005 |isbn=1-873592-87-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Wilkin |first=Susan |title=The application of emerging new technologies by Portsmouth Dockyard, 1790–1815 |publisher=The Open University |type=PhD Thesis |year=1999}} (copies available from the British Thesis service of the British Library).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor1-last=Cantrell |editor1-first=J | editor2-last =Cookson |editor2-first=G |title=Henry Maudslay and the Pioneers of the Machine Age |place=Stroud |year=2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This method of working did not catch on in general manufacturing in Britain for many decades, and when it did it was imported from America, becoming known as the ''American System of Manufacturing'', even though it originated in England.

The [[Lowell system]] is also related to the American system during this time.  It emphasized procuring, training, and providing housing and other living necessities for the workforce, as well as using semi-automated machines in a centralized factory building or complex.

Gribeauval's idea was conveyed to the US by two routes. First, Blanc's friend [[Thomas Jefferson]] championed it, sending copies of Blanc's memoirs and papers describing his work to [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry Knox]].  Second, artillery officer [[Louis de Tousard]] (who had served with [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]]) was an enthusiast of Gribeauval's ideas. Tousard wrote two influential documents after the [[American Revolution]]; one was used as the blueprint for [[West Point]], and the other became the officer's training manual.&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984" /&gt;

The War Department, which included officers trained at West Point on Tousard's manual, established the armories at [[Springfield Armory|Springfield]] and [[Harper's Ferry]] and tasked them with solving the problem of interchangeability. The task was finally accomplished in the 1820s. Historian [[David A. Hounshell]] believes that this was done by [[Captain John H. Hall]], an [[Inside contracting|inside contractor]] at Harper's Ferry.&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984"/&gt; In a letter dated 1822 Hall makes the claim he achieved interchangeability in 1822.&lt;ref name ="Cowan 1997"/&gt; But historian [[Diana Muir]] argues that it is more probable that it was [[Simeon North]], a Connecticut arms contractor manufacturing guns for the US Army. North, not Hall, was the inventor of the crucial [[milling machine]] in 1816, and had an advantage over Hall in that he worked closely with the first industry that mass-produced complex machines from mass-produced [[interchangeable parts]], the Connecticut clock-making industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Diana | last = Muir | title = [[Reflections in Bullough's Pond]] | publisher = University Press of New England}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}  By 1815 the idea of interchangeability was well established in the US government system of procurement; Congressional contracts stipulated this quality in muskets, rifles and pistols ordered after that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = James Burke (science historian)| first = James | last = Burke | title = Connections | publisher = Little, Brown &amp; Co | origyear = 1978 | year = 1995 | ISBN = 0-316-11672-6 | page = 151}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Interchangeability of firearms parts at the U.S. armories was found to have been in use for a number of years by the time of the 1853 British Parliamentary Commissions Committee on Small Arms inquiry.&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984" /&gt;

A critical factor in making interchangeable metal parts was the invention of several [[machine tool]]s, such as the slide rest lathe, screw cutting lathe, turret lathe, milling machine and metal planer. One of the most important and versatile of these machine tools was [[David Wilkinson (machinist)#Wilkinson lathe|David Wilkinson's lathe]], for which he received a $10,000 award from the government of the United States.&lt;ref name="Thompson2009"&gt;{{cite book | title=Structures of Change in the Mechanical Age: Technological Invention in the United States 1790–1865 |last=Thompson |first= Ross |year=2009 |publisher =The Johns Hopkins University Press |location= Baltimore, MD |isbn= 978-0-8018-9141-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}

[[Eli Whitney]] is generally credited with the idea and the practical application, but both are incorrect attributions. Based on his reputation as the inventor of the [[cotton gin]], the US government gave him a contract in 1798 for 10,000 muskets to be produced within two years. It actually took eight years to deliver the order, as Whitney perfected and developed new techniques and machines. In a letter to Treasury Secretary Oliver Wolcott apologizing for the delays, Whitney wrote:
{{quote| One of my primary objectives it to form tools so the tools themselves shall fashion the work and give to every part its just proportion – which when once accomplished, will give expedition, uniformity, and exactness to the whole…  In short, the tools which I contemplate are similar to engraving on a copper plate from which may be taken a great number of impressions, perfectly alike.&lt;ref name= "Cowan 1997"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Cowan |first= Ruth Schwartz |title= A Social History of American Technology | publisher=Oxford University Press | place =New York |year=1997 |pages=7–8 |isbn= 0-19-504606-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}}}

Whitney did use machinery; however, there is no evidence that he produced any new type of metalworking machinery.&lt;ref name= "Cowan 1997" /&gt; After completing the initial contract, Whitney went on to produce another 15,000 muskets within the following two years. Whitney never actually expressed any interest in interchangeability until 1800, when [[Treasury Secretary]] [[Oliver Wolcott, Jr.|Wolcott]] exposed him to the memoirs of Blanc,&lt;ref name= "hounshell-1984" /&gt; but he spent far more time and energy promoting the idea than developing it.

In order to spread knowledge of manufacturing techniques, the War Department made contractors open their shops to other manufacturers and competitors.  The armories also openly shared manufacturing techniques with private industry.&lt;ref name = "Thompson2009" /&gt; Additionally, the idea migrated from the armories to industry as machinists trained in the armory system were hired by other manufacturers. Skilled engineers and machinists thus influenced American [[clockmaker]]s and sewing machine manufacturers Wilcox and Gibbs and Wheeler and Wilson, who used interchangeable parts before 1860.&lt;ref name= "hounshell-1984" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Path to Mechanized Shoe Production in the United States |last= Thomson |first = Ross | year = 1989 | publisher = University of North Carolina Press | isbn = 978-0-80781867-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late to adopt the interchangeable system were [[Singer Corporation]] sewing machine (1870s), [[reaper]] manufacturer [[Cyrus McCormick|McCormick Harvesting Machine Company]] (1870s–80s)&lt;ref name = "hounshell-1984" /&gt; and several large steam engine manufacturers such as Corliss (mid-1880s)&lt;ref name = "Hunter 1985"&gt;{{cite book |title= A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930 | volume = 2: Steam Power |last=Hunter |first= Louis C. | year=1985 |publisher = University Press of Virginia | location = Charlottesville}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as locomotive makers. Large scale of production of bicycles in the 1880s used the interchangeable system.&lt;ref name = "hounshell-1984" /&gt;

The idea would also help lead to the American "Golden Age" of manufacturing when [[Henry Ford]] mass-produced the automobile. Mastering true interchangeability on the assembly line, the Ford plant produced standard model cars. These efficient production strategies allowed these automobiles to be affordable for the middle class.

===Pre-Industrial Revolution===
{{more citations needed |date=November 2006}}
The idea of interchangeable parts and the separate assembly line was not new, though it was little used. The idea was first developed in [[East Asia]] during the [[Warring States]] period and later the [[Qin Dynasty]] over 2200 years ago – bronze crossbow triggers and locking mechanisms were mass-produced and made to be interchangeable. [[Venice]] during the late Middle Ages had ships that were produced using pre-manufactured parts, [[assembly line]]s, and [[mass production]]. The [[Venetian Arsenal]] apparently produced nearly one ship every day, in what was effectively the world's first [[factory]].

[[File:Car transporter 001.JPG|thumb|250px]]

An '''auto transport broker''' is a type of [[cargo broker]] that specializes in the shipping and transportation of vehicles. Most vehicles shipped in the U.S. are cars and trucks, but many brokers handle boats, RVs, motorcycles and other types of vehicles as well. Auto transport is classified as "specialized freight trucking" under [[North American Industry Classification System|NAICS]] code 484230.

==How Brokers Work==

An auto transport broker is part of the personal vehicle freight business industry chain. In the U.S., these broker companies must have proper licensing and authority from the [[FMCSA]] to be allowed to broker vehicles for customers.  The individual or business that needs to move a car or other vehicle is the shipper; the shipper contacts a broker to have their vehicle shipped or transported.  Once a broker is booked, the broker's job is to find a carrier, which is the individual or company that actually employs drivers and operates the car transport equipment.

Brokers are employed because they have access to freight [[load board]]s, where they can post the job and find carriers that have transportation resources in the area. They can also get lower shipping prices by getting competing bids by different carriers. However, brokers and carriers are not always separate entities - a number of auto transport companies handle both brokerage and transport.

==Numbers==

The [[United States Department of Transportation|US Department of Transportation]] keeps statistics on cargo shipments, showing over $651 billion worth of motorized and other vehicles (including parts) moved by truck in 2007. Of that number, $452bn of cargo was moved via for-hire truck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2007 Commodity Flow Survey, Table 7|url=https://www.bts.gov/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/commodity_flow_survey/final_tables_december_2009/index.html | publisher=Bureau of Transportation Statistics | accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official statistics about the size of the secondary auto transport market, number of commercial-size [[car carrier trailer|car carrier]] vehicles on the road and number of vehicles shipped aren't kept by the DOT.

With the advent of the Internet, the auto transport industry has seen an influx of new brokers, attracted by the low cost of starting a brokerage business online. While this encouraged greater competition and lower costs in the industry, government agencies have also seen a "dramatic increase in complaints against auto transporters and auto transport brokers" due to Internet fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.protectyourmove.gov/documents/PYM-Consumer-Advisory-Auto-Transport.pdf | title= Consumer Advisory about Automobile Transporters | publisher= The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) | accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Licensing requirements==

Auto transport brokers in the USA are subject to government licensing. The candidate must obtain an Operating Authority number from the [[Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration]] by filling out a form on the FMCSA website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FMCSA online registration page |url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/registration-licensing/online-registration/onlineregdescription.htm |publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) Registration &amp; Assistance: Number/Operating Authority |accessdate=December 11, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209064840/http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/registration-licensing/online-registration/onlineregdescription.htm |archivedate=December 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FORM OP-1  APPLICATION FOR MOTOR PROPERTY CARRIER |url=http://autotransportbrokerleads.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/op1.pdf | publisher= U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration  | accessdate= 11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a small application processing fee. Brokers are also required to obtain a [[Surety bond|bond]]. Known as a [[Freight broker bond|Freight Broker Bond]], it exists to cover losses by the motor carrier, in case the broker commits fraud or other lapses. Prior to 2012, the minimum bond was $10,000, although many brokers chose to obtain higher amounts.

==2012 regulations==

The [[Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=WEISMAN|first=JONATHAN|title=Congress Approves a $127 Billion Transportation and Student Loan Package|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/us/politics/congress-approves-transportation-and-student-loan-package.html|accessdate=11 December 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; signed by [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] on July 6 of 2012, introduced a number of new regulations for auto transport brokers. The chief among them is raising the minimum broker bond from $10,000 to $75,000. The new provision goes in force on October 1, 2013, and has applied to all existing brokers retroactively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MAP-21 Broker and Freight Forwarder Questions &amp; Answers |url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/documents/MAP-21/Broker-Rule-Questions.pdf |publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) |accessdate=11 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030073721/http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/documents/MAP-21/Broker-Rule-Questions.pdf |archivedate=October 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BMC-84 Freight Broker Bond is paid for on an annual basis. The freight broker bond cost is figured as a percentage of the bond amount depending on 
* Credit of ownership ([[credit score]], age/status of any Public Records)
* Years in Business
* Financials
* Experience
Other rules include:

* A license status review by the FMCSA every five years; the FMCSA also has the power to revoke a broker's license in case of unethical practices.
* A 3-year relevant experience and certified training requirement to obtain a broker license, bringing auto shipping broker qualification requirements in line with the ocean shipping industry.&lt;ref name=forwarderlaw&gt;{{cite web|last=Block|first=Steve|title=MAP-21: New Surface Transportation Legislation Overcomes Political Obstacles to Bring Law Closer to Industry Realities|url=http://www.forwarderlaw.com/library/view.php?article_id=854|publisher=Forwarder Law|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tighter regulation of "interlining," the practice of freight carriers hiring other carriers to "perform all or part of the services the originating carrier is obliged" to provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seaton|first=Henry|title=Intermodal Moves Make for Messy Law|url=http://www.ccjdigital.com/law-18|publisher=Commercial Carrier Journal|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, carriers that contract all or part of the job to other carriers will need to procure separate broker authority from the government. A transport company will also be required to notify its customers what role (carrier, forwarder or broker) it plays at each stage of the transport job, as well as which USDOT body regulates the activity.&lt;ref name=forwarderlaw /&gt;

===Industry Reactions===

The Association of Independent Property Brokers &amp; Agents (AIPBA), a property broker trade group that claims 1,400 members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About AIPBA |url=http://aipba.vpweb.com/About-AIPBA.html |publisher=Association of Independent Property Brokers &amp; Agents (AIPBA) |accessdate=11 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922091614/http://aipba.vpweb.com/About-AIPBA.html |archivedate=22 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  has petitioned and lobbied against higher bond requirements when these have been proposed in the past,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OPEN LETTER TO OOIDA |url=http://aipba.vpweb.com/OPEN-LETTER-TO-OOIDA.html |publisher=Association of Independent Property Brokers &amp; Agents (AIPBA) |accessdate=11 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228081659/http://aipba.vpweb.com/OPEN-LETTER-TO-OOIDA.html |archivedate=28 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and has harshly criticized the new law. The founder &amp; president of AIPBA, James Lamb, has called the law a lobbyist-driven attempt to "eliminate small brokers from the market" and establish an oligopoly that charges customers more and pays carriers less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dills|first=Todd|title=Small brokers reload on $75K bond|url=http://www.overdriveonline.com/small-brokers-reload-on-75k-bond/|accessdate=11 December 2013|newspaper=OverDrive |date=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Association for Minority Truckers (NAfMT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NAfMT Official Site |url=http://nafmt.com/ |publisher=National Association for Minority Truckers (NAfMT) |accessdate=12 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109023707/http://nafmt.com/ |archivedate=November 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has also come out against the higher bond requirements. NAfMT CEO Kevin Reid called the $75,000 bond an "unreasonable barrier to entry for would-be entrepreneurs." He also spoke out against the new restrictions on owner-operators brokering out excess freight. The NAfMT has joined efforts by AIPBA to repeal the stricter surety requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dills|first=Todd|title=Broker bond increase challenge gets new backer|url=http://www.overdriveonline.com/broker-bond-increase-challenge-gets-new-backer/|accessdate=11 December 2013|newspaper=OverDrive |date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other industry associations have been supportive of the law. The [[Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association]] (OOIDA), a group that represents independent trucking owner-operators, has been a key force behind the new regulations. While the final rules in MAP-21 fell short of the OOIDA's wishes, Todd Spencer, executive vice president of the organization, praised them as a "win-win" for truckers and legitimate brokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller |first=Eric |title=Higher Bond Enrages Small Brokers |url=http://www.steelheadfinance.com/2012/07/higher-bond-enrages-small-brokers |publisher=Steal Head Finance |accessdate=11 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807064313/http://www.steelheadfinance.com/2012/07/higher-bond-enrages-small-brokers |archivedate=August 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Transportation Intermediaries Association]] (TIA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIA Official Site |url=http://www.tianet.org/AM/template.cfm?section=Home |publisher=Transportation Intermediaries Association |accessdate=11 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201084934/http://www.tianet.org/AM/template.cfm?section=Home |archivedate=December 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  a major third-party logistics trade organization, has also advocated for the new FMCSA regulations through its lobbying arm TIAPAC as a way to protect motor carriers from both incompetent and unscrupulous brokers. TIA board member Ken Lund acknowledged that the new bond may be difficult for smaller brokers to pay, but defended it as "reasonably priced" and useful to prevent fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dills|first=Todd|title=Ken Lund: 75K broker bond no ‘large broker’ move|url=http://www.overdriveonline.com/ken-lund-75k-broker-bond-no-large-broker-move/|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=Overdrive|date=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Banking business process outsourcing''' or '''banking BPO''' is a highly specialized sourcing strategy used by [[bank]]s and lending institutions to support the business acquisition and account servicing activities associated with the customer lending lifecycle.  These specific BPO services are usually offered through multi-year [[service-level agreements]] for all or portions of the [[credit card lending]], [[consumer lending]] or [[commercial lending]] segments of the financial services market. Some larger financial services organizations choose to extend their sourcing strategy to include other outsourced services such as [[Information Technology Outsourcing|ITO]] systems and software, [[human resources outsourcing]] and benefits services, [[finance and accounting outsourcing]] (FAO) services, procurement or [[training outsourcing]].

Banking BPO services are typically defined by industry analysts, advisors and leaders in the sourcing industry, such as the set of discrete processes or transactional activities that support the  lending lifecycle as follows:
* '''New customer acquisition services''' include [[telemarketing]] activities, application processing, [[underwriting]], customer or merchant credit evaluation and verification, credit approval, [[document processing]], account opening and [[customer care]] and on-boarding.
* '''Account servicing processes''' for [[credit cards]] or [[consumer loan]]s. These most commonly include payment processing systems and services, customer service or [[call center]] support operations (voice, digital, email and mail services), product renewals, and loan disbursement; [[document management]] services such as printing and mailing of statements, networked printing and storage solutions; [[collection (payment)|collection]]s, recoveries processing, default management, risk management and [[foreclosure]].
* '''Consumer and commercial lending''' post origination transaction processing services, such as check processing, clearance and settlement services, [[remittance]], and [[records management]].
* '''Back office transaction process management''' for loans or credit card portfolios, including custody services, [[fraud]] mitigation and detection, regulatory and program [[compliance (regulation)|compliance]], portfolio [[analytics]], reporting, conversions, management of technology platforms, interface for customer data and custom development.

'''Burn rate''' is the rate at which a company is losing money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.capshare.com/blog/burn-rate-101/|title=Burn Rate 101: How to Calculate and Understand Burn Rate [Downloadable Excel Model Included] - Capshare Blog|date=2016-06-22|website=Capshare Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is typically expressed in monthly terms.  E.g., "the company's burn rate is currently $65,000 per month."  In this sense, the word "burn" is a synonymous term for negative [[cash flow]]. It is also measure for how fast a company will use up its shareholder capital.&lt;ref name="forbes_20130104"&gt;Ehrenberg, David. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2013/01/04/is-your-company-dangerously-rushing-to-scale/ "Is Your Company Dangerously Rushing To Scale?"] ''Forbes.com'' January 4, 2013. Retrieved on May 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; If the shareholder capital is exhausted, the company will either have to start making a profit, find additional funding, or close down.

The term came into common use during the [[dot-com era]] when many start-up companies went through several stages of funding before emerging into profitability and positive cash flows and thus becoming self-sustainable (or, as for the majority, failing to find additional funding and sustainable business models and thus going bankrupt). In between funding events, burn rate becomes an important management measure, since together with the available funds, it provides a time measure to when the next funding event needs to take place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ron Conway]] and [[Mike Maples]], [http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=1902 lecture and discussion with science and engineering entrepreneurship students], [[Stanford Entrepreneurship Corner]], 2008.01.23&lt;/ref&gt;

Some entrepreneurs and investors say that part of the reasons behind the [[dot-com bust]] was the unsound management and financial investor practices to keep the burn rate up, taking it as a proxy for how fast the start-up company was acquiring a customer base.

The term '''burn rate''' can also refer to how quickly individuals spend their money, particularly their [[discretionary income]]. For example, Mackenzie Investments commissioned a test to gauge the spending and saving behavior of Canadians to determine if they are “Overspenders.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.financialpost.com/money/rrsp/story.html?id=290425 Financial Post Story&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205192051/http://www.financialpost.com/money/rrsp/story.html?id=290425 |date=February 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In project management ==

Aside from financing, the term '''burn rate''' is also used in [[project management]] to determine the rate at which hours (allocated to a project) are being used, to identify when work is going out of scope, or when efficiencies are being lost. Simply put, the burn rate of any project is the rate at which the project budget is being burned (spent).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmhut.com/the-project-scorecard The Project Scorecard]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[earned value management]], burn rate is calculated via the formula, 1/CPI, where CPI stands for Cost Performance Index, which is equal to Earned Value / Actual Cost.

A '''business guru''' or '''management guru''' is a leading authority on business practices and can be defined as 'a person with [[influencer|influential]] ideas or theories about business'. The earliest use of the term business guru can be tracked back to the 1960s being used in ''[[Business Week]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = business guru - definition of business guru in English from the Oxford dictionary|url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/business-guru?q=business+guru|website = www.oxforddictionaries.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no existing qualifications that make someone a business guru.

One English&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/authors/carol-kennedy |title=Carol Kennedy |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Random House Group |access-date=2015-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; writer has described management gurus as "overwhelmingly a US phenomenon."&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennedy|first=Carol|title=Guide to the Management Gurus: 5th Edition|year=2012|publisher=Random House|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-HqZ8wyeYMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples and lists==

There is no definitive list of business gurus, but some writers have proposed "personal" lists.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; These lists are mostly created by organizations such as business magazines or management writers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There have been many business guru lists created through history.

A list consisting of people who are included in almost all of the lists created, collectively known as the "Famous Five", are: [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]], [[Michael Porter]], [[Alfred Sloan]], [[Peter Drucker]], and [[Douglas McGregor]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hindle|first=Tim|title=Guide to Management Ideas and Gurus|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|pages=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-K_wp74bK3sC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, ''Harvard Business Review'' asked the gurus to name their favorite gurus. The people named were Peter Drucker, James March and Herbert Simon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another list includes Peter Drucker, Michael Porter, and [[Tom Peters]] as the three leading gurus of our time.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012"/&gt;

There are also many gurus who have emerged and disappeared through history. For example, the Japanese were known for making improvements to the business world and bringing out gurus in the 1980s, which included Keniche Ohmae and Akio Morita. Then European gurus emerged, which included Yves Doz, Geert Hofstede, Manfred Kets De Vries and Charles Handy.&lt;ref name="Hindle"/&gt;

==Criticisms of "guru" status==
One management expert, [[Gary Hamel]], says there have been "few genuine breakthroughs" since the work of Taylor and [[Max Weber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Asian Development Bank|title=Compendium of Knowledge Solutions|year=2010|publisher=Asian Development Bank|pages=304|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vAo_CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT304#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, Hamel says that management is "stuck in a time warp."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamel|first=Gary|title=The Future of Management|year=2013|publisher=Harvard Business Press|pages=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gLktvtlqHSYC&amp;pg=PA4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, even one of the authors of a book about management gurus warns that [[management theory]] is "not served well by fads," citing [[Enron]] as a "[[management fad]] for its supposed culture of [[innovation]]."&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012"/&gt;

==United States==
{{main article|American business history}}

===Robber baron debate===
{{main article|Robber baron (industrialist)}}
Even before academic studies began, Americans were enthralled by the [[Robber baron (industrialist)|Robber baron debate]]. As the United States industrialized very rapidly after the Civil War, a few hundred prominent men made large fortunes by building and controlling major industries, such as railroads, shipping, steel, mining and banking. Yet the newer who gathered the most attention was railroader [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]]. Historian Stephen Frazier argues that probably most Americans admired Vanderbilt; they agreed with biographer William Augustus Croffut who wrote in 1886:
:It is now known that the desire to own property is the chief difference between the Savage in the enlightened man; that aggregations of money in the hands of individuals are in inestimable blessing to Society, for without them there could be no public improvements or private enterprises, no railroads or steamships,  or telegraphs; no cities, the leisure class, no schools, colleges, literature, art – in short, no civilization. The one man to whom the community owes most is the capitalist, that the menu gives, but the man who saves and invests, so that his property reproduces and multiplies itself instead of being consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Augustus Croffut|title=The Vanderbilts and the Story of Their Fortune|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X9kpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA275|year=1886|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Fraser goes on, there was a minority who vehemently dissented:
:A minority were irate and excoriated the titans of finance and industry as 'robber barons' and worse. [[E.L. Godkin]], founder of ''[[The Nation]]'', launched a volley of invective at the new plutocracy: 'kings of the street' like Vanderbilt displayed 'unmitigated and immitigable selfishness' as appalling as their 'audacity, push, unscrupulousness and brazen disregard of others' rights'.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Fraser, [http://www.thenation.com/article/misunderstood-robber-baron-cornelius-vanderbilt/ "The Misunderstood Robber Baron: On Cornelius Vanderbilt: T.J. Stiles's The First Tycoon is a gilded portrait of the robber baron Cornelius Vanderbilt", '' The Nation'' Nov. 11, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
By the Great Depression of the 1930s, Fraser continues:
:Biographies of Mellon, Carnegie and Rockefeller were often laced with moral censure, warning that 'tories of industry' were a threat to democracy and that parasitism, aristocratic pretension and tyranny have always trailed in the wake of concentrated wealth, whether accumulated dynastically or more impersonally by the faceless corporation. This scholarship, and the cultural persuasion of which it was an expression, drew on a deeply rooted sensibility–partly religious, partly egalitarian and democratic–that stretched back to William Jennings Bryan, Andrew Jackson and Tom Paine.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, "The Misunderstood Robber Baron"&lt;/ref&gt;

However a counterattack by academic historians began as the Depression ended. Business historian [[Allan Nevins]] challenged this view of big businessmen by advocating the "Industrial Statesman" thesis.  Nevins, in his ''John D. Rockefeller: The Heroic Age of American Enterprise'' (2 vols., 1940), took on Josephson.  He argued that while Rockefeller may have engaged in some unethical and illegal business practices, this should not overshadow his bringing order to industrial chaos of the day. [[Gilded Age]] capitalists, according to Nevins, sought to impose order and stability on competitive business, and that their work made the United States the foremost economy by the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Nevins, ''John D. Rockefeller: The Heroic Age of American Enterprise'' (2 vols., 1940).&lt;/ref&gt;  Business journalist [[Ferdinand Lundberg]] later criticized Nevins for confusing readers.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Lundberg. ''The Rockefeller Syndrome''. New York: Lyle Stuart, 1975. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, historian Priscilla Roberts argues that Nevins' studies of inventors and businessmen brought about a reassessment of American industrialization and its leaders. She writes: 
:Nevins argued that economic development in the United States caused relatively little human suffering, while raising the general standard of living and making the United States the great industrial power capable of defeating Germany in both world wars. The great capitalists of that period should, he argued, be viewed, not as 'robber barons', but as men whose economic self-interest  had played an essentially positive role in American history, and who had done nothing criminal by the standards of their time.&lt;ref&gt;Priscilla M. Roberts, "Nevins, Allan" in {{cite book|author=Kelly Boyd, ed.|title=Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, vol. 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0121vD9STIMC&amp;pg=PA869|year=1999|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians and biographers who followed Nevins' lead include [[Jean Strouse]], [[Ron Chernow]], David Nasaw, and T. J. Stiles, chronicling the lives and careers of such dominant figures as [[J. Pierpont Morgan]], [[John D. Rockefeller]], [[Andrew Carnegie]], and [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]].  Though these later biographers did not confer heroic status on their subjects, they used historical and biographical investigations to establish a more complex understanding of the American past, and the history of American economic development in particular.

In 1958 historian Hal Bridges finds that "The most vehement and persistent controversy in business history has been that waged by the critics and defenders of the 'robber baron' concept of the American businessman."&lt;ref&gt;Hal Bridges, "The Robber Baron Concept in American History", ''Business History Review'' (1958) 32#1 pp.&amp;nbsp;1–13 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3111897 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of the Robber Baron model, by the end of the 20th century scholars had mostly discarded it although it remained influential in the popular culture. [[Richard White (historian)|Richard White]], historian of the transcontinental railroads, stated in 2011 he has no use for the concept, because it had been killed off by historians [[Robert Wiebe]] and [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.|Alfred Chandler]]. He notes that "Much of the modern history of corporations is a reaction against the Robber Barons and fictions."&lt;ref&gt;Richard White, ''Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America'' (2011) pp. xxxi, 234, 508.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic studies===
Meanwhile, business history as an academic discipline was founded by Professor [[N. S. B. Gras]] at the [[Harvard University Graduate School of Business Administration]], starting in 1927. He defined the field's subject matter and approach, wrote the first general treatise in the field, and helped [[Harvard]] build a tradition of scholarship as well as the leading library in the field. He edited a series of monographs, the Harvard Studies in Business History. He also served as editor of the ''Bulletin of the Business Historical Society'' (1926–1953), a journal which later became the ''[[Business History Review]]'' (1954-date).   N.S.B. Grass and Henrietta M. Larson, ''Casebook in American business history'' (1939) defined the field for a generation.&lt;ref&gt;See  N.S.B. Grass and Henrietta M. Larson, ''Casebook in American business history'' (1939)&lt;/ref&gt;

Business history in the U.S. took off in the 1960s with a high volume of product and innovative methodologies. Scholars worked to develop theoretical explanations of the growth of business enterprise, the study of strategy and structure by Alfred Chandler being a prime example. The relationship between business and the federal government became a focal point of study. On the whole, the 1960s affirmed the conclusions of the earlier decades regarding the close interrelationship between government and business enterprise.

===Chandler===
After 1960 the most influential scholar was [[Alfred D. Chandler]] (1918-2007) at the [[Harvard Business School]].  In a career that spanned over sixty years, Chandler produced numerous groundbreaking monographs, articles, and reviews. Intensely focused on only a few areas of the discipline, Chandler nonetheless succeeded in establishing and developing an entirely new realm of business history.&lt;ref&gt;Richard R. John, "Elaborations, Revisions, Dissents: Alfred D. Chandler Jr.'s The Visible Hand after Twenty Years," ''Business History Review'' (1997) 7#1 pp 151-200 [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~twod/oil/NEW_SCHOOL_COURSE2005/articles/research-oil/research-oil/john_chandlers_visible_hand_20_yrs_after_bus-hst-revw_1997.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard R. John, "Turner, Beard, Chandler: Progressive Historians." ''Business History Review'' 82.02 (2008): 227-240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Walker  Laird, "Alfred D. Chandler, Jr. and the Landscape of Marketing History." ''Journal of Macromarketing'' 20#2 (2000): 167-173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chandler's masterwork was ''The Visible Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business'' (1977). His first two chapters looked at traditional owner-operated small business operations in commerce and production, including the largest among them, the slave plantations in the South. Chapters 3-5 summarize the history of railroad management, with stress on innovations not just in technology but also in accounting, finance and statistics. He then turned to the new business operations made possible by the rail system in mass distribution, such as jobbers, department stores and mail order. A quick survey (ch 8) review mass innovation in mass production.The integration of mass distribution and mass production (ch 9-11) led to many mergers and the emergence of giant industrial corporations by 1900.  Management for Chandler was much more than the CEO, it was the whole system of techniques and included middle management (ch 11) as well as the corporate structure of the biggest firms, Standard Oil, General Electric, US Steel, and DuPont (ch 13-14).  Chandler argued that modern large-scale firms arose to take advantage of the national markets and productive techniques available after the rail network was in place. He found that they prospered because they had higher productivity, lower costs, and higher profits. The firms created the "managerial class" in America because they needed to coordinate the increasingly complex and interdependent system.  This ability to achieve efficiency through coordination, not some anti-competitive monopolistic greed by robber barons, explained the high levels of concentration in modern American industry.&lt;ref&gt;Steven W. Usselman, "Still Visible: Alfred D. Chandler's The Visible Hand," ''Technology and Culture'' vol 47 #3 (2006) 584-596&lt;/ref&gt;

Chandler's work was somewhat ignored in history departments, but proved influential business, economics, and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas K. McCraw, "Alfred Chandler: His Vision and Achievement," ''Business History Review,'' Summer 2008, Vol. 82 Issue 2, pp 207-226&lt;/ref&gt;  In sociology, for example, prior to Chandler's research, sociologists assumed there were no differences between governmental, corporate, and nonprofit organizations. Chandler's focus on corporations clearly demonstrated that there were differences, and this thesis has guided organizational sociologists' work since the 1970s. It also motivated sociologists to investigate and critique Chandler's work more closely, turning up instances in which Chandler assumed American corporations acted for reasons of efficiency when they actually operated in a context of politics or conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[[Neil Fligstein]], "Chandler and the Sociology of Organizations," ''Business History Review,'' Summer 2008, Vol. 82 Issue 2, pp 241-250&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians, such as [[Gabriel Kolko]], challenged the very notion of "efficiency through coordination", arguing instead that [[big business]] had, for reasons of inefficiency and a dislike of market discipline, openly sought government assistance to keep market forces at bay.

===Other mechanisms===
Lamoreaux ''et al.'' (2003)offers a new synthesis of American business history during the 19th-20th centuries. Moving beyond the markets-versus-hierarchies framework that underlies the previously dominant interpretation of Chandler, the authors highlight the great variety of coordination mechanisms in use in the economy at any given time. Drawing on late-20th-century theoretical work in economics, they show how the relative advantages and disadvantages of these different mechanisms have shifted in complex and often unpredictable ways as a result of changing economic circumstances. One advantage of this perspective is that it avoids the teleology that has characterized so much writing in the field. As a result, the authors can situate the "New Economy" of the late 20th century in broad historical context without succumbing to the temptation to view it as a climactic stage in the process of economic development. They thus provide a particularly persuasive example of the importance of business history to the understanding of national and international history.&lt;ref&gt;Naomi R. Lamoreaux et al, "Beyond Markets and Hierarchies: Toward a New Synthesis of American Business History." ''American Historical Review'' 2003 108(2): 404-433.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative===
Understanding the development of business history as a discipline meriting its own aims, theories and methods is often understood as a transition from dominating themes of 'company biography', toward more analytical 'comparative' approaches. This 'comparative' trend enabled practitioners to underline their work with 'generalist' potential. Questions of comparative business performance have become a staple, featuring into the wider economic histories of nations, regions and communities. For many this transition was first achieved by [[Alfred D. Chandler]]. Chandler’s successors as Isidor Straus Professor of Business History at [[Harvard Business School]] continued to emphasize the importance of comparative research and course development. In 1995 [[Thomas K. McCraw]] published ''Creating Modern Capitalism'' (Cambridge, MA 1995) &lt;ref name="McCraw1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas K. McCraw|title=Creating Modern Capitalism|year=1995|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-17555-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book compared the business histories of Britain, Germany, Japan and the United States since the Industrial Revolution, and was used as the text of a new year MBA course at [[Harvard Business School]]. [[Geoffrey Jones (academic)|Geoffrey Jones]], who was McCraw’s successor as Isidor Straus Professor of Business History, also pursued a comparative research agenda. He published a comparative study of the history of globalization called ''Multinationals and Global Capitalism'' (Oxford, 2005).&lt;ref name="Jones2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Jones|title=Multinationals and Global Capitalism|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-927210-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Jones also published a comparative history of the global beauty industry entitled ''Beauty Imagined: A History of the Global Beauty Industry'' (Oxford, 2010).&lt;ref name=Jones2010&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Jones|title=Beauty Imagined: A History of the Global Beauty Industry|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2010|isbn=978-0199556496}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Jones and the Business History Initiative at the [[Harvard Business School]] has sought to facilitate research and teaching on African, Asian and Latin American business history in a project called Creating Emerging Markets, which includes interviews with long-time leaders of firms and NGOs in those regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/emerging-markets/Pages/default.aspx |website=Creating Emerging Markets |publisher=Harvard Business School}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/thriving-in-the-turbulence-of-emerging-markets |title=Thriving in the Turbulence of Emerging Markets |website=Working Knowledge: The Thinking That Leads |publisher=Harvard Business School |date=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/building-histories-of-emerging-economies-one-interview-at-a-time |title=Building Histories of Emerging Economies One Interview at a Time |website=Working Knowledge: The Thinking That Leads |publisher=Harvard Business School |date=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A trend in recent years has been to compare the business histories of individual countries. [[Geoffrey Jones (academic)]] and Andrea Lluch have published a comparative study of the historical impact of globalization on Argentina and Chile.&lt;ref name="JonesLluch2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Jones|author2=Andrea Lluch|title=The Impact of Globalization on Argentina and Chile. Business Enterprises and Entrepreneurship|year=2015|publisher=Edward Elgar|isbn=978-1-78347-363-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Jones and his co-editor Walter A. Friedman published an editorial in ''Business History Review'' which identified comparative research as essential for the future of business history as a discipline.&lt;ref name="FriedmanJones2011"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Walter A. Friedman|author2=Geoffrey Jones|date= 2011|title=Time for Debate|journal=Business History Review|volume=85|issue=3|pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
American historians working in French business history led by [[Rondo Cameron]] argued that most of the business enterprises in France were family-owned, small in scale, and managed conservatively.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Kemp,  "French economic performance: some new views critically examined." ''European History Quarterly'' 15.4 (1985): 473-488.&lt;/ref&gt;  By contrast, French business historians emphasized the success of national economic planning since the end of World War II. They argued that the economic development in this period stemmed from various phenomena of the late 19th century: the corporation system, the joint-stock deposit and investment banks, and the technological innovations in the steel industry. To clarify the contributions of 19th-century entrepreneurs to the economic development in France, French scholars support two journals, '' Enterprises et Histoire'' and ''Revue d'Histoire de la Siderurgie.''&lt;ref&gt;Youssef Cassis, "Business History in France" in Franco Amatori and Geoffrey Jones, eds. ''Business history around the world'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003) pp. 192-214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;François Crouzet, "The historiography of French economic growth in the nineteenth century." ''Economic History Review'' 56.2 (2003): 215-242.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin America==
Barbero (2008) examines the development of the field of Latin American business history, from the 1960s to 2007. Latin American business history developed in the 1960s, but until the 1980s it was dominated by either highly politicized debates over Latin American underdevelopment or biographies of Latin American entrepreneurs. Since the 1980s, Latin American business history has become a much more professionalized and an integrated part of Latin American academia. It is much less politicized and has moved beyond entrepreneurial biography to histories of companies and industries. However, Latin American business historians have still not devoted enough attention to agricultural enterprises or comparative histories between the many countries. Probably most importantly, Latin American business historians have to become much more versed in business history theory and methodology so as to get beyond mere summation of the region's economic past.&lt;ref&gt;María Inés Barbero,  "Business History in Latin America: A Historiographical Perspective," ''Business History Review,'' (2008) 82#3, pp 555-575&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carlos, Marichal, "Archival Note: Banking History and Archives in Latin America," ''Business History Review,'' (2008) 82#3 pp 585-602&lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain==
Business History in Britain emerged in the 1950s following the publication of a series of influential company histories and the establishment of the journal ''Business History''&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/00076791.asp ''Business History''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414213334/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/00076791.asp |date=2011-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1958 at the University of Liverpool. The most influential of these early company histories was [[Charles Wilson (historian)]]’s ''History of Unilever'', the first volume of which was published in 1954. Other examples included Coleman’s work on Courtaulds and artificial fibres, Alford on Wills and the tobacco industry, Barker on Pilkington’s and glass manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;John Wilson, and Steven Toms, J.S ‘Fifty years of Business History’, ''Business History'' (2008) 50#2 pp.125-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;. Leslie Hannah, ‘New Issues in British Business History’, ''Business History Review'' (1983) 57# 2, pp.165-174.&lt;/ref&gt;  These early studies were conducted by primarily by economic historians interested in the role of leading firms in the development of the wider industry, and therefore went beyond mere corporate histories. Although some work examined the successful industries of the industrial revolution and the role of the key entrepreneurs, in the 1970s scholarly debate in British business history became increasingly focused on economic decline. For economic historians, the loss of British competitive advantage after 1870 could at least in part be explained by entrepreneurial failure, prompting further business history research into individual industry and corporate cases. The Lancashire cotton textile industry, which had been the leading take-off sector in the industrial revolution, but which was slow to invest in subsequent technical developments, became an important topic of debate on this subject. [[William Lazonick]] for example argued that cotton textile entrepreneurs in Britain failed to develop larger integrated plants on the American model; a conclusion similar to Chandler’s synthesis of a number of comparative case studies.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, A., Scale and Scope: The Dynamics of Industrial Capitalism, Cambridge Mass.: Belknap Press (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Mass, &amp; William Lazonick, "The British Cotton Industry and International Competitive Advantage: the state of the debates," ''Business History,'' (1990) 32#4 pp. 9-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of British business leaders have emphasized how they fit into the class structure, especially their relationship to the aristocracy, and the desire to use their wealth to purchase landed estates, and hereditary titles.&lt;ref&gt;Howard L. Malchow, ''Gentlemen capitalists: the social and political world of the Victorian businessman'' (Stanford University Press, 19920.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William D. Rubinstein, "Wealth, elites and the class structure of modern Britain." ''Past &amp; Present'' 76 (1977): 99-126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julia A. Smith,  "Land ownership and social change in late nineteenth-century Britain." ''Economic History Review'' 53#.4 (2000): 767-776. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2598603 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Biography has been of less importance in British business history, but there are compilations.&lt;ref&gt;David J. Jeremy, ed., ''Dictionary of business biography: a biographical dictionary of business leaders active in Britain in the period 1860-1980'' (Butterworths, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;
British business history began to widen its scope in the 1980s, with research work conducted at the LSE's Business History Unit, led first by Leslie Hannah, then by Terry Gourvish. Other research centres followed, notably at Glasgow and Reading, reflecting an increasing involvement in the discipline by Business and Management School academics. More recent editors of ''Business History'', [[Geoffrey Jones (academic)]](Harvard Business School), Charles Harvey (University of Newcastle Business School), John Wilson (Liverpool University Management School) and Steven Toms (Leeds University Business School) have promoted management strategy themes such as networks, family capitalism, corporate governance, human resource management, marketing and brands, and multi-national organisations in their international as well as merely British context. Employing these new themes has allowed business historians to challenge and adapt the earlier conclusions of Chandler and others about the performance of the British economy.&lt;ref&gt;Toms, Steven and Wilson, John F. "Scale, Scope and Accountability: Towards a New Paradigm of British Business History," ''Business History'' (2003) 45#4 pp 1-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Utilising the DW/BI system is the final step before business users can get access to the information. The first impression the business community gets is when introduced to the BI frontend drives. Because the acceptance from the users is important the deployment has to be thoughtfully planned to ensure that the DW/BI system can perform and is delivering the results it is designed to.
To ensure that the implementation can perform and deliver it has to be exposed to extensive end-to-end testing .&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Kimball|Kimball]] et al., ''The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit'', Second Edition. New York, Wiley, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-470-14977-5}}, 542&lt;/ref&gt; The process of testing is an ongoing activity along the development process, because defects that should be correct later in the lifecycle are difficult to find and are associated with exponentially increasing costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.information-management.com/issues/20070601/1086005-1.html?pg=1 Information Management: Strategies for Testing Data Warehouse Applications]&lt;/ref&gt; A way of securing that the testing is done through the development lifecycle is to follow a methodology.
Kimball prescribe that before adding the DW/BI system, it should have passed a mock test that will cover the following procedures;
 
* Testing procedures
* Data quality
* Operations process testing
* Performance testing
* Deployment testing
* User desktop readiness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9312">A '''business rule''' defines or constrains some aspect of [[business]] and always resolves to either true or false. Business rules are intended to assert business structure or to control or influence the behavior of the business.&lt;ref name="BRG1" /&gt; Business rules describe the operations, definitions and constraints that apply to an organization.  Business rules can apply to people, processes, corporate behavior and computing systems in an organization, and are put in place to help the organization achieve its goals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

For example, a business rule might state that ''no credit check is to be performed on return customers''.  Other examples of business rules include requiring a rental agent to disallow a rental tenant if their credit rating is too low, or requiring company agents to use a list of preferred suppliers and supply schedules.

While a business rule may be informal or even unwritten, documenting the rules clearly and making sure that they don't conflict is a valuable activity.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}  When carefully managed, rules can be used to help the organization to better achieve goals, remove obstacles to market growth, reduce costly mistakes, improve communication, comply with legal requirements, and increase customer loyalty.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Introduction==
'''Business rules'''  tell an organization ''what'' it can do in detail, while strategy tells it ''how'' to focus the business at a macro level to optimize results.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Put differently, a strategy provides high-level direction about what an organization should do. Business rules provide detailed guidance about how a strategy can be translated to action.

Business rules exist for an organization whether or not they are ever written down, talked about or even part of the organization's consciousness.  However it is a fairly common practice for organizations to gather business rules.  This may happen in one of two ways.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Organizations may choose to proactively describe their business practices, producing a database of rules.  While this activity may be beneficial, it may be expensive and time-consuming.  For example, they might hire a consultant to comb through the organization to document and consolidate the various standards and methods currently in practice.

Gathering business rules is also called rules harvesting or [[business rule mining]]. The [[business analyst]] or consultant can extract the rules from IT documentation (like use cases, specifications or system code).  They may also organize workshops and interviews with subject matter experts (commonly abbreviated as SMEs). Software technologies designed to capture business rules through analysis of legacy source code or of actual user behavior can accelerate the rule gathering processing.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

More commonly, business rules are discovered and documented informally during the initial stages of a project.  In this case the collecting of the business rules is incidental.  In addition, business projects, such as the launching of a new product or the re-engineering of a complex process, might lead to the definition of new business rules.  This practice of incidental, or emergent, business rule gathering is vulnerable to the creation of inconsistent or even conflicting business rules within different organizational units, or within the same organizational unit over time. This inconsistency creates problems that can be difficult to find and fix.

Allowing business rules to be documented during the course of business projects is less expensive and easier to accomplish than the first approach{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}, but if the rules are not collected in a consistent manner, they are not valuable.  In order to teach business people about the best ways to gather and document business rules, experts in business analysis have created the [[business rules approach|Business Rules Methodology]].  This methodology defines a process of capturing business rules in natural language, in a verifiable and understandable way.  This process is not difficult to learn, can be performed in real-time, and empowers business stakeholders to manage their own business rules in a consistent manner.

== Categories ==

According to the white paper by the Business Rules Group,&lt;ref name="BRG1"&gt;Business Rules Group, ''Defining Business Rules ~ What Are They Really?'', [http://www.businessrulesgroup.org/first_paper/br01c0.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; a statement of a business rule falls into one of four categories:
*Definitions of business terms
The most basic element of a business rule is the language used to express it. The very definition of a term is itself a business rule that describes how people think and talk about things. Thus, defining a term is establishing a category of business rule. Terms have traditionally been documented in a [[Glossary]] or as entities in a [[Conceptual schema|conceptual model]].

*Facts relating terms to each other
The nature or operating structure of an organization can be described in terms of the facts that relate terms to each other. To say that a customer can place an order is NOT a business rule, but a ''fact''. '''Facts''' can be documented as natural language sentences or as relationships, attributes, and generalization structures in a graphical model.

*Constraints (also called "action assertions")
Every enterprise constrains behavior in some way, and this is closely related to constraints on what data may or may not be updated. To prevent a record from being made is, in many cases, to prevent an action from taking place.

*Derivations
Business rules (including laws of nature) define how [[knowledge]] in one form may be transformed into other knowledge, possibly in a different form.

== Real world applications and obstacles ==

Business rules are gathered in these situations: 
# When dictated by law
# During the [[business analysis]]
# As an [[ephemeral]] [[aid]] to engineers.
  
This lack of consistent approach is mostly due to the cost and effort required to maintain the list of rules.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

While newer software tools are able to combine business rule management and execution, it is important to realize that these two ideas are distinct, and each provides value that is different from the other.  Software packages automate business rules using [[business logic]].  The term ''business rule'' is sometimes used interchangeably with ''business logic''; however the latter connotes an engineering practice and the former an intrinsic business practice{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}.  There is value in outlining an organization's business rules regardless of whether this information is used to automate its operations.

One of the pitfalls in trying to fill the gap between rules management and execution is trying to give business rules the syntax of logic, and merely describing logical constructs in a natural language. Translation for engines is easier, but business users will no longer be able to write down the rules.

== Formal specification ==

Business rules can be expressed using modeling approaches such as [[Unified Modeling Language]], [[Z notation]], [[Business Process Execution Language]], [[Business Process Modeling Notation]], [[Decision Model and Notation]] or the [[Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules]] (SBVR).{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Business rules encoded in computer code in an operational program are known as [[business logic]].

Similar to how [[Business Risks]] can be structured as:

If &lt;condition(s)&gt; Then &lt;consequence(s)&gt;

a Business Rule can be structured as:

When &lt;condition(s)&gt; Then &lt;imposition(s)&gt; Otherwise &lt;consequence(s)&gt;

It honors the highest ideals of the petroleum industry and is awarded to honor the achievements and character of a petroleum executive. Recently it has been presented at the annual meeting of the [[Independent Petroleum Association of America]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]].

The bronze Joe Roughneck bust, created by [[Torg Thompson]] and presented to each Chief Roughneck recipient, began life in [[Lone Star Steel Company]] print advertising.

Joe Roughneck's sculpture has been dedicated in several oil patch parks, saluted by governors, and featured in newspaper and magazine articles.

The '''Chief Ethics Officer''' (CFO) is a senior ranking individual in an organization. The primary role is to build a strong ethical culture within the organization. In order to perform these responsibilities the CFO must be given support, independence, and opportunity to influence key decision-making board members. The chief ethics officer normally reports to the [[chief executive officer]], and have some access to the [[board of directors]].

==The role==
Chief Ethics Officer role was redefined in 1991 for businesses, when [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the Federal Guidelines for Organization (FSCO). Before 1991 this role existed in the financial services and the health care industry without much influence because of the rash of accounting scandals such as the [[Enron scandal]]. The need for chief ethics officers has increased tremendously.  The role of chief ethics officers has increased since the passage of the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] (SOA), and amendments of the [[U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines]] (FSCO).  The role of Chief Ethics Officer is no longer a figure head position.

In 2002, after congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act and the Consumer Protection Act, chief ethics officer responsibilities have expanded.  the role has expanded to be more specific.  The chief ethics officer is responsible for Developing and distributing codes of ethics, developing training programs for employees', monitor and comply too government regulations.  His role is also to monitor and audit ethical conduct.  In addition his responsibilities entails administering punishments for violation of ethical codes of conduct.&lt;ref name="Ferrell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferrell|first1=O.C.|last2=Fraedrich|first2=John|last3=Ferrell|first3=Linda|title=Business Ethics, Ethical Decision Making and cases|date=2017|publisher=Cengage|ISBN=978-1-111-82516-4|edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/conf_processings/2012rand_cf305.PDF Rand Corporation]{{dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Price ethics ==
The primary objective of pricing ethics is to prevent the establishment of [[monopolies]], inequitable pricing practices, and reduce or restrict competition. Such laws are some times called pro-competitive legislation, which were enacted to encourage competition, and prevent activities that restrain trade.

The following are some of the acts passed by Congress, to help prevent unethical practices by businesses to manipulate prices in order to monopolize their industries, such as the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] of 1890, which prohibits organizations from holding monopolies in their industry, the [[Robinson–Patman Act]] of 1936, which bans price discrimination between retailers and wholesalers, and the Consumer Goods Pricing Acts of 1975, which prohibits price maintenance agreements among manufactures and resellers in interstate commerce.&lt;ref name="Ferrell" /&gt;

== Organizational ethics ==
[[Organizational ethics]] is the ethics of an organization, and it is how an organization responds to an internal or external issue.  Organizational ethics is independent of the [[organizational culture]]. Organizational culture tends to display the same ethical views of the surrounding community.  To reinforce positive views of the community, certain businesses give incentives to both employees and the community.  Business organizations give to community by granting scholarships, funds and resources.  Employees also give back to the community by contributing their time, gifts and talents.  When the local residents obtain the skills from skilled employees then these individuals can apply and fulfill critical skills shortages needed by the organization.  When the incentive value method represent the community in a positive way everyone wins, such as the business organization, and the community.&lt;ref name="Ferrell" /&gt;

== Ethics in business communication ==
Ethical communication is a must for a businesses to have a long and successful future.  A business cannot act unethically when dealing with its customers, employees or other businesses. Unethical communication consist of false or misleading information, which is a violation of the Federal Trade Communication. Other unethical means of marketing material, is by fraud, scams, and e-mail, or text messaging unsolicited marketing material ([[Spamming|SPAM]]).

The '''chief operating officer''' ('''COO'''), also called the '''chief operations officer''', is one of the highest-ranking executive positions in an organization, comprising part of the "[[C-Suite]]". The COO is responsible for the daily operation of the [[company]],&lt;ref name=investopedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coo.asp|title=Chief Operating Officer – COO|accessdate=2011-02-08|publisher=Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and routinely reports to the highest-ranking executive, usually the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO).&lt;ref name=Levinson1993&gt;{{Citation|title=Between CEO and COO|jstor=4165123|year=1993|author=Levinson, Harry|journal=Academy of Management Executive|pages=71–83|volume=7|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The COO is usually the [[second in command]] at the firm, especially if the highest-ranking executive is the [[Chairman]] and [[chief executive officer|CEO]].

==Responsibilities and similar titles==
Unlike other [[C-Suite]] positions, which tend to be defined according to commonly designated responsibilities across most companies, the COO job tends to be defined in relation to the specific CEO with whom they work, given the close working relationship of these two individuals.&lt;ref name=hbr2006&gt;{{Citation|title=Second in Command: The Misunderstood Role of the Chief Operating Officer|url=http://hbr.org/2006/05/second-in-command-the-misunderstood-role-of-the-chief-operating-officer/ar/1|year=2006|journal=Harvard Business Review|pages=70–79|volume=84|issue=5|last1="Miles"|first1=Stephen A.|last2="Bennett"|first2=Nathan|accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, the selection of a COO is similar to the selection of a [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] or [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] of the United States: power and responsibility structures vary in government and private regimes depending on the style and needs of the President or CEO. Thus, the COO role meets individual expectations and changes as leadership teams adjust.&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt;

===President===
In a similar vein to the COO, the title of corporate President as a separate position (as opposed to being combined with a "[[C-Suite]]" designation, such as "President and CEO" or "President and COO") is also loosely defined. The President is usually the legally recognized highest rank of corporate officer, ranking above the various Vice Presidents (including Senior Vice President and Executive Vice President), but on its own generally considered subordinate, in practice, to the CEO. 

Lloyd E. Reuss was President of [[General Motors]] from 1990 to 1992, as the right-hand man of Chairman and CEO [[Robert C. Stempel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/Lloyd_and_Mark_Reuss:_Father_and_Son|title=Lloyd and Mark Reuss: Father and Son – Generations of GM|website=history.gmheritagecenter.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630175729/https://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/Lloyd_and_Mark_Reuss:_Father_and_Son|archive-date=2017-06-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stempel insisted on naming Reuss as company president in charge of North American operations, the board reluctantly agreed but showed their displeasure by not giving Reuss the title of COO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cg.org.cn/english/practice/GM.asp Practice] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102021525/http://www.cg.org.cn/english/practice/GM.asp |date=November 2, 2013 }}.

[[Richard D. Parsons]] was number two in the company hierarchy during his tenure as President of [[Time Warner]] from 1995 to 2001, but he had no authority over the operating divisions, and instead took on assignments at the behest of Chairman and CEO [[Gerald Levin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ninamunk.com/documents/PowerFailure.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714183334/http://www.ninamunk.com/documents/PowerFailure.htm|date=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.observer.com/node/46271|title=Naomi Campbell Won't Take 'No' for an Answer|date=2017-02-09|work=Observer|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ajbianco.com/can_dick_parsons_rescue_time_warner.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100518142337/http://www.ajbianco.com/can_dick_parsons_rescue_time_warner.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-05-18|title=Anthony Bianco – Cover Stories|website=www.ajbianco.com|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Capellas]] was appointed President of [[Hewlett-Packard]] in order to ease its acquisition and integration of [[Compaq]], where Capellas was previously Chairman and CEO. Capellas ended up serving just six months as HP president before departing. His former role of president was not filled as the executives who reported to him then reported directly to the CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dignan |first=Larry |url=http://www.silicon.com/technology/networks/2002/11/12/capellas-leaves-hp-11036342/ |title=Capellas leaves HP &amp;#124; Networks |publisher=silicon.com |date=2002-11-12 |accessdate=2011-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403041405/http://www.silicon.com/technology/networks/2002/11/12/capellas-leaves-hp-11036342/ |archivedate=2012-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itjungle.com/mid/mid111302-story01.html |title=Guild Companies |publisher=Itjungle.com |date=2002-11-13 |accessdate=2011-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325164459/https://www.itjungle.com/mid/mid111302-story01.html |archivedate=2012-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the investment banking firms of [[Bear Stearns]] and [[Morgan Stanley]] each had two presidents (Warren Spector and Alan Schwartz at Bear, Robert Scully and Zoe Cruz at Morgan) reporting to one CEO (who was also chairman of the board); each president was essentially a co-COO (despite the lack of title) overseeing half of the firm's business divisions. Schwartz became sole president of Bear after Spector was ousted, and several months later assumed the position of CEO as well when [[James Cayne]] was forced to resign (Cayne remained chairman).

[[Tom Anselmi]] of [[Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment]] was Chief Operating Officer from 2004 until September 6, 2013. Between the departure of [[Richard Peddie]] and the hiring of [[Tim Leiweke]] for the posts of President and CEO, Anselmi added the title of President from September 4, 2012 to June 30, 2013, however he remained COO and did not receive the title of CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cox|first=Damien|title=Maple Leafs: New era of MLSE intrigue unfolding: Cox|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/leafs/article/1252698--a-new-era-of-mlse-intrigue-unfolding|accessdate=September 8, 2012|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Fuld]], the chairman and CEO of [[Lehman Brothers]], had a succession of "number twos" under him, usually titled as President and Chief Operating Officer. Chris Pettit was Fuld's second-in-command for two decades until November 26, 1996, when he resigned as President and board member. Pettit lost a power struggle with his deputies (Steve Lessing, Tom Tucker, and Joseph M. Gregory) on March 15 that year that caused him to relinquish its COO title, likely brought about after the three men found about Pettit's extramarital affairs, which violated Fuld's unwritten rules on marriage and social etiquette. Bradley Jack and Joseph M. Gregory were appointed co-COOs in 2002, but Jack was demoted to the Office of the Chairman in May 2004 and departed in June 2005 with a severance package of $80&amp;nbsp;million, making Gregory the sole COO. While Fuld was considered the "face" of Lehman brothers, Gregory was in charge of day-to-day operations and he influenced culture to drive the bottom line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nymag.com/print/?/news/business/52603/|title=Print Page|website=nymag.com|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory was demoted on June 12, 2008 and replaced as President and COO by [[Bart McDade]], who had been serving as head of Equities, and McDade would see Lehman through bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=Ward2010/&gt;&lt;ref name="truell"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/27/business/pettit-resigns-as-president-of-lehman-brothers-firm.html?pagewanted=print| work=The New York Times| publisher=NYTimes.com| first=Peter| last=Truell| title=Pettit Resigns as President Of Lehman Brothers Firm| date=November 27, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas W. LaSorda]] served as President and CEO of [[Chrysler]] from January 1, 2006 to August 5, 2007 while Chrysler was owned by [[Daimler-Benz]]. When [[Cerberus Capital]] bought majority control of Chrysler, [[Bob Nardelli]] was appointed [[Chairman]] and CEO of Chrysler while LaSorda became Vice Chairman and President. Despite the appointment of a second Vice Chairman and President, [[Jim Press]], LaSorda stayed on.&lt;ref name="detnews.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.detnews.com/article/20090502/AUTO01/905020344/1148/LaSorda+s+legacy+is++unselfish+devotion+ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130122054107/http://www.detnews.com/article/20090502/AUTO01/905020344/1148/LaSorda+s+legacy+is++unselfish+devotion+ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-22 |title=He led GM"s quality and lean manufacturing activities as a corporate VP |publisher=The Detroit News |date=2009-05-02 |accessdate=2014-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/corporate/cerberus-buys-chrysler.html |title=The Cerberus Takeover of Chrysler |publisher=Allpar.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaSorda's titles as Vice Chairman and President officially stated that he was in charge of manufacturing, procurement and supply, employee relations, global business development and alliances. However, LaSorda's actual role was to find a new partner or buyer for Chrysler, leading to speculation that Cerberus Capital was less interested in rebuilding the auto manufacturer than it was to turning profit though a [[leveraged buyout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/news/trans-canada-highway/so-long-lasorda/article785654/|title=So long, LaSorda|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Walt Disney Company]] has used the [[List of management of The Walt Disney Company#Presidents|President and COO]] titles in varied ways for their number two executive.  [[Ron W. Miller]] was President from 1978 to 1984, while serving additionally as CEO for 18 months from 1983 to 84.  [[Frank Wells]] was President from 1984 to 1994, where he reported to the board of directors and not Chairman and CEO [[Michael Eisner]]. When Wells died in a helicopter crash,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/05/obituaries/frank-wells-disney-s-president-is-killed-in-a-copter-crash-at-62.html|title=Frank Wells, Disney's President, Is Killed in a Copter Crash at 62|first=The Associated|last=Press|date=|website=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; no replacement President was named as his duties were resumed by Eisner. [[Michael Ovitz]] was President from 1995 to 1997, being hired by Eisner and then dismissed not long afterwards. [[Bob Iger]] was President and COO from 2000 to 2005, when he succeeded Eisner as CEO. [[Thomas O. Staggs]] was COO from 2015 to 2016, during that time the senior executive team had a dual reporting structure to both Staggs and Iger; Staggs resigned after the board did not give him assurances that he would succeed as CEO.

[[Manulife]] has used the President and COO titles for separate roles. From June 5 until September 30, 2017, Rocco "Roy" Gori served as President where he oversaw Manulife's global operating businesses, with his subordinates being the general managers of the Canadian, U.S., and Asia Divisions, and the Chief Investment Officer. Gori reported to Chief Executive Officer Donald Guloien before additionally assuming the title of CEO on October 1, 2017 upon Guloien's retirement. Linda Mantia, the Chief Operating Officer, reported to the President on Corporate Strategy while continuing to report to the CEO on all other matters including Corporate Development, Analytics, Technology, Marketing, Innovation, Human Resources, Regulatory and Public Affairs, Global Resourcing and Procurement, and the Global Program Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/manulife-appoints-roy-gori-as-president-617424583.html|title=Manulife appoints Roy Gori as President|author=|date=|website=www.newswire.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these instances the CEO either takes on more roles and responsibilities, or the roles traditionally assigned to the COO are carried out by sub [[C-Suite]] executives. Although the number of COOs has been in decline for the past 10 years, there are reasons to anticipate an increased utilization of the position in the future, including:
* Companies are becoming larger and more complex, making it more difficult for one person alone to have total oversight over the whole organization.&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt;
* Companies are finding a strong relationship between firm performance and the presence of a COO.&lt;ref name=Marcel2009&gt;{{Citation

* Companies are becoming more deliberate about [[CEO succession]] planning and will use the role to on-board and train successors.&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt;
* The increase in talent mobility means that the role will likely be used more often as a retention mechanism for key executives who are at risk of moving to a competitor.&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt;

==Roles and functions==

The role of the COO differs from industry to industry and from organization to organization. Some organizations function without a COO. Others may have two COOs, each assigned to oversee several business lines or divisions, such as [[Lehman Brothers]] from 2002 to 2004 when Bradley Jack and Joseph M. Gregory were the co-COOs.&lt;ref name=Ward2010&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A COO could also be brought in from other organizations as a "fixer," such as Daniel J. O'Neill who in 1999 joined Molson in that capacity.&lt;ref name=Molson&gt;{{Citation

In the [[manufacturing sector]], the primary role of the COO is routinely one of [[operations management]], meaning that the COO is responsible for the development, design, operation, and improvement of the systems that create and deliver the firm's [[product (business)|products]]. The COO is responsible for ensuring that [[business operations]] are efficient and effective and that the proper [[Resource management|management of resources]], [[supply chain management|distribution of goods and services to customers]] and analysis of queue systems is conducted.

Despite the functional diversity associated with the role of COO, there are some common functions the COOs usually perform:
* At the direction of the CEO and Board of Directors, marshaling limited resources to the most productive uses with the aim of creating maximum value for the company's stakeholders
* Developing and cascading the organization's strategy/mission statement to the lower-ranking staff, and implementing appropriate rewards/recognition and coaching/corrective practices to align personnel with company goals
* Planning by prioritizing customer, employee, and organizational requirements
* Maintaining and monitoring staffing, levels, Knowledge-Skills-Attributes (KSA), expectations and motivation to fulfill organizational requirements
* Driving performance measures for the operation (including a consideration of efficiency versus effectiveness), often in the form of dashboards convenient for review of high level key indicators

===COO as successor===
Routinely in large organizations the COO will be the [[heir apparent]] to the CEO.&lt;ref name=Galbraith2009&gt;{{Citation

Either way, the position is used as a training and testing ground for the next CEO.

A 2003 Crist Associates study revealed that only 17% of companies that promote a COO to a CEO replace the COO within the next year.&lt;ref name=Martin2003&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; COOs transitioning into the CEO role often face similar challenges including:
* '''Not being automatically granted the luxury of a "diagnostic period."''' Given that they know the company, COOs turned CEOs are often expected to hit the ground running when in actuality they too need to enter diagnostic mode to fully understand their new role and to see the company from a new perspective.
* '''Finding time to manage a new key stakeholder: The board.''' Many COOs turned CEOs are often surprised how time-intensive managing the Board of Directors can be and must learn to incorporate this important responsibility into an already packed schedule.
* '''Being in the spotlight.''' COOs are used to having the luxury of working "behind the scenes." As CEO, many are surprised to find they have become a "public" figure both inside and outside the organization and must learn how to manage this additional obligation.
* '''Recalibrating their image.''' Often COOs struggle not with the strategy portion of the job itself, but overcoming the perception of other stakeholders that they are an "execution" executive versus a "strategy" executive.&lt;ref name=Miles2010 /&gt;

According to researchers Miles and Bennett, just knowing these common pitfalls can help a COO "heir" better prepare for the transition, thereby avoiding them in totality or ensuring that at least they do not evolve into full derailers once they are in the CEO seat.&lt;ref name=Miles2010 /&gt;

==Relationship with CEO==

Because the COO is often responsible for serving as an information conduit to the CEO, it is essential that the relationship between COO and CEO be a positive one.&lt;ref name=Bennett2008&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trust is the most important ingredient necessary for a CEO-COO relationship to thrive. The CEO must have full confidence that the COO is not making direct passes for their job, can get the work done, and shares their vision (rather than using their trusted spot and access to information to undermine the CEO's strategy or implement his/her own vision). When a relationship built upon trust is created between the CEO and COO, firm performance is improved and shareholder results are strengthened. Seven strategies that are key to building trust in the CEO-COO relationship include:&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Miles2006&gt;{{Citation

# Communication—The CEO has to be comfortable sharing information with the COO and regularly communicating the strategy and any changes to it. Similarly, the COO has to be comfortable regularly providing status updates to the CEO. When communication breaks down, mistrust or misunderstanding is likely to mess up.
# Clear Decision Rights—The COO role appears to work the best when the roles and responsibilities of the COO have been clearly delineated ahead of time and the COO is allowed to make the final decision within pre-agreed upon scope.
# Lock on the Backdoor—The CEO must not undermine the COO's credibility by continually reversing decisions. When employees learn that they can get a different answer by going directly to the CEO as opposed to the COO, the COO role quickly becomes impotent.
# Sharing the Spotlight—In effective CEO-COO relationships, both parties are comfortable with how much "credit" they receive for their work internally, externally, from the Board of Directors, and from each other.
# Fit between CEO &amp; COO—The two individuals must respect each other and effectively partner together. This is not a partnership that can be forced.
# Fit Between the COO &amp; the Position—The selected COO must have the right credentials to carry out the purpose for which the COO role was created (which can include everything from operations expertise to change expertise to having a complementary skill set to the CEO).
# Transparency of Succession Expectations and Timeline—Both parties must understand whether the COO desires the CEO job, whether the COO is in consideration for the top job, and what the timing might be for such a transition.

==Relationship with board of directors==
In addition to having a strong and trusting relationship with the CEO, the COO should also have an effective relationship with the board.&lt;ref name=Miles2007&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good relationship between COO and the board allows the board to better understand and independently judge a potential successor. A strong relationship between the board and the COO also offers the board an additional expert opinion on the health of the company, and status of key initiatives. It benefits the CEO to allow such a relationship to form because it reflects confidence and fosters transparency. It also reinforces that the CEO is capable of developing talent, and helps the CEO to retain the COO by further empowering the individual. A strong relationship benefits the COOs in that they are able to expand their experience as well as their professional network. Additionally, if they are looking to be the next CEO, it allows them to develop credibility with the board. Researchers advise the COO to go beyond simply presenting at board meetings, to ensure they are developing strong one-on-one relationships with each board director.&lt;ref name=Miles2007 /&gt;  Researchers{{Who|date=May 2014}} also urge the COO to develop his or her own voice, independent of the CEO.

==Failure in the COO role==
Any breakdown in trust between the CEO and COO can lead to failure. Additionally, the COO typically has to be a high-level leader who is comfortable being fully in charge. Many executives with the leadership skills necessary to be a top-level COO would prefer to be running their own organization as opposed to taking orders from a CEO.  For COOs who are expecting to serve their time and be promoted to the top spot, their timelines for such a move can often be out of sync with the CEOs, causing a breakdown in the relationship. COOs can also find themselves trapped into being labeled an "operations" person or a "Number 2" as opposed to being seen as a strategic and top-level leader by the Board of Directors, which causes some executives to steer clear of the position.&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt; Harry Levinson, Ph.D., effectively summarized the challenges of the COO position: "The relationship between the chief executive officer and the chief operating officer in any organization is fraught with many psychological complexities. Perhaps it is the most difficult of all organizational working relationships because more than others, it is a balancing act on the threshold of power."&lt;ref name=Levinson1993 /&gt;

==Experts and research==
Nathan Bennett and [[Stephen A. Miles]] have published extensively on the subject of the COO. In addition to writing a book dedicated to analyzing this hard-to-understand position,&lt;ref name=shotgun&gt;{{cite book|author1=Miles, Stephen A.|author2=Nathan Bennett|title=Riding shotgun: the role of the COO|publisher=Stanford Business Books|location=Stanford, Calif|year=2006|pages=|isbn=0-8047-5166-8|oclc=|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; their research has been published in the ''Harvard Business Review'', ''MIT Management Review'' and Chief Executive.net.&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Miles2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Miles2007 /&gt; Their work focuses on identifying different types of COOs, when the role works to deliver additional value, and when the role fails to produce the desired results. Their research includes interviews with more than a hundred CEOs and COOs on the topic.

'''Commercial law''', also known as '''trade law''', is the body of [[law]] that applies to the rights, relations, and conduct of [[Legal person|persons]] and businesses engaged in [[commerce]], [[merchandising]], [[trade]], and sales.&lt;ref name=cornellcommerciallaw&gt;{{cite web|title=Commercial Law: An Overview|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/commercial_law|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often considered to be a branch of [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] and deals with issues of both [[private law]] and [[public law]].

Commercial law includes within its compass such titles as principal and agent; carriage by land and sea; [[Maritime transport|merchant shipping]]; [[guarantee]]; marine, fire, life, and accident [[insurance]]; bills of exchange, [[Negotiable instrument|negotiable instruments]], [[Contract|contracts]] and partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Commercial Law|volume=6|page=771|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these categories fall within [[Financial law]], an aspected of Commercial law pertaining specifically to financing and the financial markets. It can also be understood to regulate [[corporation|corporate]] [[contract]]s, [[Recruitment|hiring practices]], and the [[manufacturing|manufacture]] and [[sales]] of [[Final good|consumer goods]]. Many countries have adopted [[civil code]]s that contain comprehensive statements of their commercial law.

In the United States, commercial law is the province of both the [[United States Congress]], under its power to regulate interstate commerce, and the states, under their police power. Efforts have been made to create a unified body of commercial law in the United States; the most successful of these attempts has resulted in the general [[Uniform Commercial Code adoption|adoption]] of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], which has been adopted in all 50 states (with some modification by state legislatures), the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], and the U.S. territories.

Various regulatory schemes control how commerce is conducted, particularly ''vis-a-vis'' employees and customers. Privacy laws, safety laws (e.g., the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act]] in the United States), and food and drug laws are some examples.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1007">{{Unreferenced|date=June 2018}} A '''computer bureau''' is a [[service bureau]] providing computer services.

Computer bureaus developed during the early 1960s, following the development of [[time-sharing]] operating systems. These allowed the services of a single large and expensive [[mainframe]] computer to be divided up and sold as a [[fungible]] commodity. Development of telecommunications and the first [[modem]]s encouraged the growth of computer bureau as they allowed immediate access to the computer facilities from a customer's own premises.

The computer bureau model shrank during the 1980s, as cheap commodity computers, particularly the [[PC compatible|PC clone]] but also the [[minicomputer]] allowed services to be hosted [[on-premises hosting|on-premises]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3249">The '''Credit Managers' Index''' '''(CMI)''' is a monthly economic indicator of financial activity reflecting credit managers' responses to levels of favorable and unfavorable factors. The measure has been sourced in stories from publications such as the ''Wall Street Journal'', ''CFO'' and ''Bloomberg''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ww2.cfo.com/credit/2015/09/credit-managers-index-continues-decline/|title=Credit Managers' Index Continues to Decline -|last=Kuehner-Hebert|first=Katie|date=2015-09-30|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-11-01/economy-looking-up-ahead-of-big-jobs-number|title=Economy Looking Up Ahead of Big Jobs Number|last=Coy|first=Peter|website=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2007/10/01/woes-dont-extend-to-credit-managers/|title=Woes Don’t Extend to Credit Managers|last=WSJ|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracked since February 2002, the CMI is produced by the [[National Association of Credit Management]] (NACM)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nacm.org/cmi.html|title=Credit Managers' Index (CMI)|website=nacm.org|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently conducted by Armada Corporate Intelligence's Chris Kuehl, who also serves as NACM's economic advisor. The CMI is compiled through a voluntary poll of credit and finance professionals in the service and manufacturing sectors. The CMI results generally are released on the last business day of each month.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.nacm.org/CMI/PDF/CMIcurrent.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A CMI number of more than 50 indicates an economy in expansion; less than 50 indicates contraction.

Unlike many economic indexes, the CMI resisted the month-to-month swings during the most recent{{when?|date=October 2017}} economic downturn. The index accurately signaled that the economic plunge was stabilizing and beginning to recover from the recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nacmnc.org/news/news.asp?id=271241|title=Simple Act, Huge Impact - NACM North Central|website=www.nacmnc.org|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chartered Institute of Credit Management (CICM) in the UK produces a similar Index&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cicm.com/credit-management-index/|title=CICM UK Credit Management Index - Chartered Institute of Credit Management|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a quarterly basis reflecting its members' responses to questions about the same factors and it uses the same methodology.

==Methodology==
The index is based on survey responses of approximately 1,000 trade credit managers in the second half of each month. There is typically an approximately equal representation between the manufacturing and service sectors. Respondents from throughout the United States are asked to comment on whether they are seeing improvement, deterioration, or no change for various favorable and unfavorable factors.

The computation of seasonality is based on the formula used by the U.S. Census Bureau and most of the federal government's statistical gathering apparatus. This is designed to streamline comparisons between the CMI diffusion index and comparable indices.

For some countries, [[architecture]], the visual and [[performing arts]], [[sport]], [[advertising]], and cultural tourism may be included as adding value to the content and generating values for individuals and societies. They are knowledge-based and labour-intensive, creating employment and wealth. By nurturing creativity and fostering innovation societies will maintain cultural diversity and enhance economic performance.

Cultural industries worldwide have adapted [[To The New]] digital technologies and to the arrival of national, regional and international (de)regulatory policies. These factors have radically altered the context in which cultural goods, services, and investments flow between countries and, consequently, these industries have undergone a process of internationalization and progressive concentration, resulting in the formation of a few big conglomerates: a new global [[oligopoly]].

'''Customer Demand Planning''' (CDP) is a business-planning process that enables sales teams to develop demand forecasts as input to service-planning processes, production, inventory planning and revenue planning.&lt;ref&gt;Lee J. Krajewski, Larry P Ritzman, Manoj K. Malhotra: "Operations Management: Process Chain and Value Chains, 8th Edition", page 521. Pearson Education, Inc. 2007, {{ISBN|0-13-169739-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
CDP is an important aspect of managing [[value chain]]s. Generally, the first step of CDP is to [[forecasting|forecast]] product demand. A manager can [[planning|plan]] resource deployment in accordance with the resulting forecasts. It's a bottom-up approach vs. top down planning. Associated risks with this method are: Low forecast accuracy and numbers of planners required. There are various [[software system]]s created by companies such as [[Dynasys]], [[Avercast]], [[Demand Solutions]], [[RightChain TM]], [[SAS System]], [[Agentrics]], [[Manugistics]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Petrolsoft Corporation]] (now Aspen Technology), [[StatSoft]],  [[ToolsGroup]] and [[GMDH Shell]] that are designed to forecast demand and plan operations. To test the added value of implementing bottom-up approach, [[SAP APO]] applications are providing simulations functionalities to estimate the resulting Demand Forecast Accuracy (e.g. POS sales ; Sales invoices ; shipments, etc.)

In the manufacturer to retailer model, customer [[collaborative partnerships]] have been become more common since the 1990s. Although there was a lot of industry support behind CPFR (Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment), manufacturers and retailers are adopting different versions of collaborative forecasting and replenishment strategies. These include Collaborative-VMI, CPFR, Account Based Forecasting, CMI, Shared Single Forecast and replenishment etc.

=== Discovering markets ===
The challenges and complexities faced by the retailer are somewhat different from the challenges faced by suppliers (manufacturers and distributors). Therefore, the demand management technology for the merchant is somewhat different from that of the brand or manufacturer on the supply-side.
Customer Demand Planning aims at matching customer supply planning logic and imply CPFR type collaboration.
Areas components of Demand Management include Customer Experience, Demand Creation, Inventory and Pricing Optimization, Channel Management, Sourcing, Transportation Optimization and Advanced Practices in Technology.

== Required skills ==
Customer service representative positions often require at least a high school diploma. Representatives often have some experience with [[office software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Customer_Service_Representative_(CSR)/Hourly_Rate |title=Average Customer Service Representative (CSR) Hourly Pay |date=November 5, 2018 |website=[[PayScale]] |accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First impressions are very important in this job. The moment one begins to communicate with a customer, one is being judged. The way one communicates with a customer will not only influence how the conversation develops, but the overall impression of the CSR and the organization they represent. There are five key customer service skills that define the best CSRs:      
* Ability to establish rapport with customers. 
* [[Problem solving]]     
* Strong [[Understanding|listening skills]]    
* Strong commercial awareness     
* [[Team work]]ing

== Salary ==

Although earnings may vary, the median hourly average for CSRs in 2017 was $15.81, in the US.&lt;ref name=dl/&gt; People in this job typically have less than 20 years' experience. Skills that are associated with high pay for this job are those in customer service metrics, [[Microsoft Office]], [[customer relationship management]], and oral and verbal communication.

'''Dashboards''' often provide at-a-glance views of [[key performance indicators]] (KPIs) relevant to a particular objective or business process. In the other, "dashboard" has another name for "progress report" or "report."

The "dashboard" is often displayed on a web page which is linked to a database that allows the report to be constantly updated. For example, a manufacturing dashboard may show numbers related to productivity such as number of parts manufactured, or number of failed quality inspections per hour. Similarly, a human resources dashboard may show numbers related to staff recruitment, retention and composition, for example number of open positions, or average days or cost per recruitment.&lt;ref name="Briggs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.targetdashboard.com/site/Dashboard-Best-Practice/Management-Report-and-Dashboard-best-practice-index.aspx|title=Management Reports &amp; Dashboard Best Practice|last=Briggs|first=Jonathan|publisher=Target Dashboard|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term dashboard originates from the [[automobile]] [[dashboard]] where drivers   monitor the major functions at a glance via the instrument cluster.

==Benefits==
Digital dashboards allow managers to monitor the contribution of the various departments in their organization. To gauge exactly how well an organization is performing overall, digital dashboards allow you to capture and report specific data points from each department within the organization, thus providing a "snapshot" of performance.

Benefits of using digital dashboards include:&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;
*Visual presentation of performance measures
*Ability to identify and correct negative trends
*Measure efficiencies/inefficiencies
*Ability to generate detailed reports showing new trends
*Ability to make more informed decisions based on collected [[business intelligence]]
*Align strategies and organizational goals
*Saves time compared to running multiple reports
*Gain total visibility of all systems instantly
*Quick identification of data outliers and correlations

==Classification==
Dashboards can be broken down according to role and are either [[strategic]], analytical, operational, or informational.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Few, ''Information Dashboard Design: The Effective Visual Communication of Data'' (O'Reilly, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Strategic dashboards support managers at any level in an organization, and provide the quick overview that decision makers need to monitor the health and opportunities of the business. Dashboards of this type focus on high level measures of performance, and forecasts. Strategic dashboards benefit from static snapshots of data (daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly) that are not constantly changing from one moment to the next. Dashboards for analytical purposes often include more context, comparisons, and history, along with subtler performance evaluators. Analytical dashboards typically support interactions with the data, such as drilling down into the underlying details. Dashboards for monitoring operations are often designed differently from those that support strategic decision making or data analysis and often require monitoring of activities and events that are constantly changing and might require attention and response at a moment's notice.

==Types of dashboards==

Digital dashboards may be laid out to track the flows inherent in the business processes that they monitor. Graphically, users may see the high-level processes and then [[data drilling|drill down]] into low level data. This level of detail is often buried deep within the corporate enterprise and otherwise unavailable to the senior executives.

Three main types of digital dashboard dominate the market today: stand alone software applications, web-browser based applications, and desktop applications also known as [[desktop widgets]]. The last are driven by a [[Software widget|widget engine]].

Specialized dashboards may track all corporate functions. Examples include [[human resources]], [[Recruitment|recruiting]], [[sales]], [[Business operations|operations]], [[security]], [[information technology]], [[project management]], [[customer relationship management]] and many more departmental dashboards. For a smaller organization like a startup a compact startup scorecard dashboard tracks important activities across lot of domains ranging from social media to sales.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

Digital dashboard projects involve business units as the driver and the information technology department as the enabler. The success of digital dashboard projects often depends on the [[measurement|metrics]] that were chosen for monitoring. [[Key performance indicator]]s, [[balanced scorecard]]s, and sales performance figures are some of the content appropriate on business dashboards.

==Dashboards and scoreboards==
Balanced Scoreboards and Dashboards have been linked together as if they were interchangeable. However, although both visually display critical information, the difference is in the format: Scoreboards can open the quality of an operation while dashboards provide calculated direction. 
A balanced scoreboard has what they called a "prescriptive" format. It should always contain these components (Active Strategy)...
*Perspectives – group
*Objectives – verb-noun phrases pulled from a strategy plan
*Measures – also called Metric or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
*Spotlight Indicators – red, yellow, or green symbols that provide an at-a-glance view of a measure’s performance.
Each of these sections ensures that a Balanced Scorecard is essentially connected to the businesses critical strategic needs.

The design of a dashboard is more loosely defined.  Dashboards are usually a series of graphics, charts, gauges and other visual indicators that can be monitored and interpreted.  Even when there is a strategic link, on a dashboard, it may not be noticed as such since objectives are not normally present on dashboards.  However, dashboards can be customized to link their graphs and charts to strategic objectives.&lt;ref&gt;ZSL Inc., ''Dashboards Vs Scorecards – An Insight'' ZSL Inc. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Digital dashboard technology is available "out-of-the-box" from many software providers. Some companies however continue to do in-house development and maintenance of dashboard applications. For example, [[GE Aviation]] has developed a proprietary software/portal called "Digital Cockpit" to monitor the trends in aircraft spare parts business.

Good dashboard design practices take into account and address the following:

* the medium it is designed for (desktop, laptop, mobile, tablet)
* use of visuals over tabluar presentation of data
** bar charts: to visualize one or more series of data
** line charts: to track changes in a number of dependent data sets over a period of time
** sparklines: to show the trend in a single data set
* use of legends anytime more than one color or shape is present on a graph
* spatial arrangement: place your most important view on the top left (if the language is written left to right) then arrange the following views in a Z pattern with the most important information following the top-to-bottom, left-to-right pattern&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Firican|first=George|date=May 22, 2017|title=Best Practices for Powerful Dashboards|url=https://tdwi.org/research/2017/05/business-intelligence-journal-vol-22-no-2.aspx|journal=Business Intelligence Journal|volume=22|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* color palettes to be colorblind friendly 

A good information design will clearly communicate key information to users and makes supporting information easily accessible.&lt;ref&gt;Stacey Barr, ''7 Small Business Dashboard Design Dos and Don'ts'' (Barr, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessing the quality of dashboards==
There are a few key elements to a good dashboard:.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Hetherington, ''Dashboard Demystified: What is a Dashboard?'' (Hetherington, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
# Simple, communicates easily
# Minimum distractions...it could cause confusion
# Supports organized business with meaning and useful data
# Applies human visual perception to visual presentation of information
# It can be accessed easily by its intended audience&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lightsondata.com/white-paper-on-best-practices-for-powerful-dashboards/|title=White Paper: Best practices for powerful dashboards|last=|first=|date=May 29, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The idea of digital dashboards followed the study of [[decision support system]]s in the 1970s. Early predecessors of the modern business dashboard were first developed in the 1980s in the form of [[Executive Information Systems]] (EISs). Due to problems primarily with data refreshing and handling, it was soon realized that the approach wasn’t practical as information was often incomplete, unreliable, and spread across too many disparate sources.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Few, ''Information Dashboard Design: The Effective Visual Communication of Data'' (O'Reilly, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, EISs hibernated until the 1990s when the information age quickened pace and data warehousing, and [[online analytical processing]] (OLAP) allowed dashboards to function adequately.{{fact|date=August 2014}} Despite the availability of enabling technologies, the dashboard use didn't become popular until later in that decade, with the rise of [[key performance indicators]] (KPIs), and the introduction of Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton's [[Balanced Scorecard]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wayne W. Eckerson]], ''Performance Dashboards: Measuring, Monitoring, and Managing Your Business'' (Wiley , 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, [[Microsoft]] promoted a concept known as the [[Digital Nervous System]] and "digital dashboards" were described as being one leg of that concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kmworld.com/Articles/News/Breaking-News/Microsoft-refines-Digital-Dashboard-concept--12189.aspx | title=Microsoft refines Digital Dashboard concept | accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the use of dashboards forms an important part of Business Performance Management (BPM).

[[File:ERP Modules.png|500px|thumb|right|Diagram showing some typical ERP modules]]

'''Enterprise resource planning''' ('''ERP''') is the integrated management of core business processes, often in real-time and mediated by software and technology.

ERP is usually referred to as a category of business-[[management]] software — typically a suite of integrated [[application software|application]]s—that an organization can use to collect, store, manage, and interpret data from these many [[business sector|business]] activities.

ERP provides an integrated and continuously updated  view of core business processes using common [[database]]s maintained by a [[database management system]]. ERP systems track business resources—cash, [[raw material]]s, [[production capacity]]—and the status of business commitments: orders, [[purchase order]]s, and [[payroll]]. The applications that make up the system share data across various departments (manufacturing, purchasing, sales, [[accounting]], etc.) that provide the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/JEIM-03-2015-0024|title=Antecedents of ERP systems implementation success: a study on Jordanian healthcare sector|journal=Journal of Enterprise Information Management|volume=29|issue=4|pages=549|last=Almajali|first=Dmaithan|date=|website=|publisher=Emeralad|access-date=|accessdate=January 6, 2016|doi=10.1108/JEIM-03-2015-0024|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ERP facilitates information flow between all business functions and manages connections to outside [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Radovilsky |first=Zinovy |editor-last=Bidgoli |editor-first=Hossein |year=2004 |title=The Internet Encyclopedia, Volume 1 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |page=707 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ACfBmYiNaTcC&amp;pg=PA707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enterprise system software is a multibillion-dollar industry that produces components supporting a variety of business functions. IT investments have become the largest category of capital expenditure in United States-based businesses over the past{{which|date=November 2015}} decade. Though early ERP systems focused on large enterprises, smaller enterprises increasingly use ERP systems.&lt;ref&gt;Rubina Adam, Paula Kotze, Alta van der Merwe. 2011. Acceptance of enterprise resource planning systems by small manufacturing Enterprises. In: Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems, edited by Runtong Zhang, José Cordeiro, Xuewei Li, Zhenji Zhang and Juliang Zhang, SciTePress, p. 229 - 238&lt;/ref&gt;

The ERP system integrates varied organizational systems and facilitates error-free transactions and production, thereby enhancing the organization's efficiency. However, developing an ERP system differs from traditional system development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shaul | first1 = L. | last2 = Tauber | first2 = D. | year = 2012 | title = CSFs along ERP life-cycle in SMEs: a field study | url = | journal = Industrial Management &amp; Data Systems | volume = 112 | issue = 3| pages = 360–384 | doi=10.1108/02635571211210031}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ERP systems run on a variety of [[computer hardware]] and [[Computer network|network]] configurations, typically using a [[database]] as an [[information repository]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Origin==
The Gartner Group first used the abbreviation ERP in the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2583660/e-commerce/extended-erp-technology-reborn-in-b2b.html|title=Extended ERP technology reborn in B2B|last=InfoWorld|first=Heather Harreld,|access-date=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A Vision of Next Generation MRP II", Scenario S-300-339, Gartner Group, April 12, 1990{{Third-party-inline|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to extend upon the capabilities of [[material requirements planning]] (MRP), and the later [[manufacturing resource planning]] (MRP II),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Without replacing these terms, ERP came to represent a larger whole that reflected the evolution of application integration beyond manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sheilds |first=Mureell G. |title=E-Business and ERP: Rapid Implementation and Project Planning |year=2005 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons, Inc. |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all ERP packages developed from a manufacturing core; ERP vendors variously began assembling their packages with finance-and-accounting, [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]], and human-resource components. By the mid-1990s ERP systems addressed all core enterprise functions. Governments and non–profit organizations also began to use ERP systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=SI |last=Chang |author2=Guy Gable |author3= Errol Smythe |author4= Greg Timbrell  |conference= International Conference on Information Systems |title= A Delphi examination of public sector ERP implementation issues |pages= 494–500 |publisher= [[Association for Information Systems]] |year= 2000 |location= Atlanta |url= http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=359640.359793|accessdate= September 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==

ERP systems experienced rapid growth in the 1990s. Because of the [[year 2000 problem]] and the introduction of the [[euro]] that disrupted legacy systems, many companies took the opportunity to replace their old systems with ERP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thin Enterprise Resource Planning |publisher=Thomson Course Technology |year=2006 |location=Boston |edition=Second |isbn=0-619-21663-8 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ERP systems initially focused on automating [[back office]] functions that did not directly affect [[customer]]s and the public. [[Front office]] functions, such as [[customer relationship management]] (CRM), dealt directly with customers, or [[electronic business|e-business]] systems such as [[e-commerce]], [[e-government]], e-telecom, and [[e-finance]]—or [[Supply chain management|supplier relationship management]] (SRM) became integrated later, when the internet simplified communicating with external parties.&lt;ref name="HaymanERP00"&gt;{{cite journal |title=ERP in the Internet Economy |journal=Information Systems Frontiers |author=Hayman, L. |volume=2000 |issue=2 |pages=137–139 |year=2000 |doi=10.1023/A:1026595923192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"ERP II" was coined in 2000 in an article by Gartner Publications entitled ''ERP Is Dead—Long Live ERP II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The ERP II role expands traditional ERP resource optimization and [[transaction processing]]. Rather than just manage buying, selling, etc.—ERP II leverages information in the resources under its management to help the enterprise collaborate with other enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncg.edu/bae/people/holderness/readings/ERP_is_Dead--Long_Live_ERP_II.pdf |title=The Bryan School of Business and Economics at UNCG—Exceptional Problem Solvers |publisher=Uncg.edu |accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ERP II is more flexible than the first generation ERP. Rather than confine ERP system capabilities within the organization, it goes beyond the corporate walls to interact with other systems. Enterprise application suite is an alternate name for such systems. ERP II systems are typically used to enable collaborative initiatives such as [[Supply chain management|supply chain management (SCM)]], [[Customer relationship management|customer relationship management (CRM)]], and [[Business intelligence|business intelligence (BI)]] among business partner organizations through the use of various [[Electronic business|e-business technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charles Møller|date=August 1, 2005|title=ERP II: a conceptual framework for next‐generation enterprise systems?|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/17410390510609626|journal=Journal of Enterprise Information Management|volume=18|issue=4|pages=483–497|doi=10.1108/17410390510609626|issn=1741-0398}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruhi|first=Umar|date=July 1, 2016|title=An experiential learning pedagogical framework for enterprise systems education in business schools|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472811716300222|journal=The International Journal of Management Education|volume=14|issue=2|pages=198–211|doi=10.1016/j.ijme.2016.04.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developers now make more effort to integrate mobile devices with the ERP system. ERP vendors are extending ERP to these devices, along with other business applications. Technical stakes of modern ERP concern integration—hardware, applications, networking, supply chains. ERP now covers more functions and roles—including [[decision making]], stakeholders' relationships, [[standardization]], [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]], [[globalization]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shaul | first1 = L. | last2 = Tauber | first2 = D. | year = 2013 | title = Critical Success Factors in Enterprise Resource Planning Systems: Review of the Last Decade | doi = 10.1145/2501654.2501669 | journal = ACM Computing Surveys | volume = 45 | issue = 4| page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
ERP  systems typically include the following characteristics:
* An integrated system 
* Operates in (or near) real time
* A common database that supports all the applications
* A consistent look and feel across modules
* Installation of the system with elaborate application/data integration by the Information Technology (IT) department, provided the implementation is not done in small steps&lt;ref&gt;Sheilds, Mureell G., E-Business and ERP: Rapid Implementation and Project Planning. (2001) John Wiley and Sons, Inc. p. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Deployment options include: [[on-premises]], cloud hosted, or [[SaaS]]

==Functional areas==
An ERP system covers the following common functional areas. In many ERP systems, these are called and grouped together as ERP modules:
* [[Finance &amp; Accounting]]: [[General Ledger]],  [[Fixed assets|Fixed Assets]], [[Accounts Payable|payables]] including vouchering, matching and payment,  [[Accounts Receivable|receivables]] Cash Management and collections, [[cash management]],  [[Consolidation (business)|Financial Consolidation]]
* [[Management Accounting]]: [[Budgeting]], Costing, [[cost management]], [[activity based costing]]
* [[Human resources]]: [[Recruitment|Recruiting]], [[training]], [[Schedule (workplace)|rostering]], [[payroll]], [[Employee benefit|benefits]], [[Pensions|retirement and pension plans]], [[Diversity (business)|diversity management]], [[retirement]], [[Employee exit management|separation]]
* Manufacturing: [[Engineering]], [[bill of materials]], work orders, [[scheduling]], [[capacity utilization|capacity]], [[workflow management system|workflow management]], [[quality control]], manufacturing process, manufacturing projects, manufacturing flow,  [[product life cycle management]]
* Order Processing: [[Order to cash]], order entry, credit checking, [[pricing]], available to promise, [[inventory]], [[shipping]], sales analysis and reporting, sales commissioning.
* [[Supply chain management]]: Supply chain planning, supplier scheduling, [[product configurator]], [[order to cash]], [[purchasing]], [[inventory]], claim processing, [[warehousing]] (receiving, putaway, [[Order picking|picking]] and [[Packaging and labeling|packing]]).
* [[Project management]]: Project planning, resource planning, project costing, [[work breakdown structure]], [[Invoice|billing]], time and expense, performance units, activity management
* Customer relationship management: Sales and marketing, commissions, service, customer contact, [[call center]] support&amp;nbsp;— CRM systems are not always considered part of ERP systems but rather Business Support systems (BSS).
* Data services : Various "self–service" interfaces for customers, suppliers and/or employees

=== GRP ===
Government resource planning (GRP) is the equivalent of an ERP for the [[public sector]] and an  integrated office automation system for government bodies.&lt;ref&gt;
Yunliang, Xiongtao, Qing, Jing and  Ning (2010) "Design of E-Government Information Management Platform Based on SOA Framework", 2010 First International Conference on Networking and Distributed Computing, Hangzhou, doi:10.1109/ICNDC.2010.42.&lt;/ref&gt; The software structure, modularization, core algorithms and main interfaces do not differ from other ERPs, and ERP software suppliers manage to adapt their systems to government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Kern and Havenhand (2000) "ERP Critical Success Factors: an exploration of the contextual factors in public sector institutions", Proceedings of the 35th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Gable, Smythe and Timbrell (2000) "A Delphi examination of public sector ERP implementation issues" Proceedings of ICIS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ebrahim | first1 = Zakareya | last2 = Irani | first2 = Zahir | year = 2005 | title = E‐government adoption: architecture and barriers | url = | journal = Business Process Management Journal | volume =  11| issue = 5| pages =  589–611| doi = 10.1108/14637150510619902 | citeseerx =10.1.1.453.87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both system implementations, in private and public organizations, are adopted to improve productivity and overall business performance in organizations, but comparisons (private vs. public) of implementations shows that the main factors influencing ERP implementation success in the public sector are cultural.&lt;ref&gt;Wingreen, Maryam  and Hritik (2014) "An Investigation into Enterprise Resource Planning Implementation Success: Evidence from Private and Public Sector Organizations", [http://aisel.aisnet.org/pacis2014/339 PACIS 2014/339].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.2860.pdf Shafqat, Enhong and Faisal (2012)], "Enterprise Resource Planning - 'real blessing' or 'a blessing in disguise': an exploration of the contextual factors in public sector"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coelho | first1 = Cunha | last2 = Meirelles | first2 =  | year = 2015 | title = The client-consultant relationship in the implementation of ERP in government: exploring the dynamic between power and knowledge | url = | journal = DGO | volume =  | issue = | pages = 140 | page =  | doi = 10.1145/2757401.2757405 | isbn = 9781450336000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
* [[Database transaction|Transactional database]]
* Management portal/[[dashboard (business)|dashboard]]
* People
* Software

==Best practices==
Most ERP systems incorporate [[best practice]]s. This means the software reflects the vendor's interpretation of the most effective way to perform each business process. Systems vary in how conveniently the customer can modify these practices.&lt;ref&gt;Monk, Ellen and Wagner, Brett."Concepts in Enterprise Resource Planning" 3rd.ed.Course Technology Cengage Learning.Boston, Massachusetts.2009&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, best practices reduced risk by 71% compared to other software implementations.&lt;ref&gt;"Enhanced Project Success Through SAP Best Practices&amp;nbsp;– International Benchmarking Study". {{ISBN|1-59229-031-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of best practices eases compliance with requirements such as [[IFRS]], [[Sarbanes-Oxley]], or [[Basel II]]. They can also help comply with de facto industry standards, such as [[electronic funds transfer]]. This is because the procedure can be readily codified within the ERP software and replicated with confidence across multiple businesses who share that business requirement.&lt;ref name="IngolfoEstab11"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Establishing Regulatory Compliance for Software Requirements |journal=Conceptual Modeling - ER 2011 | last1=Ingolfo | first1=S. | last2=Siena | first2=A. | last3=Mylopoulos | first3=J. |pages=47–61 |year=2011 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-24606-7_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSITSys"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.metricstream.com/insights/IT_sys_val.htm |title=IT Systems Validation for SOx and Regulatory Compliance |work=Insights |publisher=MetricStream, Inc |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connectivity to plant floor information==
ERP systems connect to real–time data and transaction data in a variety of ways. These systems are typically configured by [[systems integrator]]s, who bring unique knowledge on process, equipment, and vendor solutions.

'''Direct integration'''—ERP systems have connectivity (communications to plant floor equipment) as part of their product offering. This requires that the vendors offer specific support for the plant floor equipment their customers operate. ERP vendors must be experts in their own products and connectivity to other vendor products, including those of their competitors.

'''Database integration'''—ERP systems connect to plant floor data sources through staging tables in a database. Plant floor systems deposit the necessary information into the database. The ERP system reads the information in the table. The benefit of staging is that ERP vendors do not need to master the complexities of equipment integration. Connectivity becomes the responsibility of the systems integrator.

'''[[Enterprise appliance transaction module]]s (EATM)'''—These devices communicate directly with plant floor equipment and with the ERP system via methods supported by the ERP system. EATM can employ a staging table, web services, or system–specific program interfaces ([[Api|APIs]]). An EATM offers the benefit of being an off–the–shelf solution.

'''Custom–integration solutions'''—Many system integrators offer custom solutions. These systems tend to have the highest level of initial integration cost, and can have a higher long term maintenance and reliability costs. Long term costs can be minimized through careful system testing and thorough documentation. Custom–integrated solutions typically run on [[workstation]] or server-class computers.

==Implementation==
ERP's scope usually implies significant changes to staff work processes and practices.&lt;ref name="tech-faq.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tech-faq.com/erp.shtml |title=ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) |publisher=Tech-faq.com |date=March 5, 2014 |accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, three types of services are available to help implement such changes—consulting, customization, and support.&lt;ref name="tech-faq.com" /&gt; Implementation time depends on business size, number of modules, customization, the scope of process changes, and the readiness of the customer to take ownership for the project. Modular ERP systems can be implemented in stages. The typical project for a large enterprise takes about 14 months and requires around 150 consultants.&lt;ref name="carl.sandiego.edu"&gt;{{cite web |title=Critical Issues Affecting an ERP Implementation |url=http://carl.sandiego.edu/gba573/critical_issues_affecting_an_erp.htm |publisher=Auerbach Publications |work=Information Systems Management |volume=16 |issue=3 |page=7 |year=1999 |accessdate=January 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103032912/http://carl.sandiego.edu/gba573/critical_issues_affecting_an_erp.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small projects can require months; multinational and other large implementations can take years.&lt;ref name="SankarImplement06"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVS9AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8 |title=Implementation Strategies for SAP R/3 in a Multinational Organization: Lessons from a Real-World Case Study |last1=Sankar |first1=C. |last2=Rau |first2=K.-H. |publisher=Cybertech Publishing |page=8 |year=2006 |isbn=9781591407782 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PelphreyDirecting15"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KJO9BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA92 |title=Directing the ERP Implementation: A Best Practice Guide to Avoiding Program Failure Traps While Tuning System Performance |author=Pelphrey, M.W. |publisher=CRC Press |pages=92–111 |year=2015 |isbn=9781482248425}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mass customization|Customization]] can substantially increase implementation times.&lt;ref name="carl.sandiego.edu" /&gt;

Besides that, information processing influences various business functions e.g. some large corporations like [[Wal-Mart]] use a [[Just in time (business)|just in time]] inventory system. This reduces inventory storage and increases delivery efficiency, and requires up-to-date data. Before 2014, Walmart used a system called Inforem developed by [[IBM]] to manage replenishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecitywire.com/node/31165 |title=Wal-Mart slow to roll out new replenishment system |publisher=Thecitywire.com |location=Arkansas |date=January 8, 2014 |accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process preparation===
Implementing ERP typically requires changes in existing business processes.&lt;ref&gt;Turban et al. (2008). ''Information Technology for Management, Transforming Organizations in the Digital Economy''. Massachusetts: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., pp. 300–343. {{ISBN|978-0-471-78712-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor understanding of needed process changes prior to starting implementation is a main reason for project failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = C. | last2 = Vessey | first2 = I. | title = Managing the Next Wave of Enterprise Systems: Leveraging Lessons from ERP | url = | journal = MIS Quarterly Executive | volume = 2 | issue = 1| year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulties could be related to the system, business process, infrastructure, training, or lack of motivation.

It is therefore crucial that organizations thoroughly analyze business processes before they implement ERP software. Analysis can identify opportunities for process modernization. It also enables an assessment of the alignment of current processes with those provided by the ERP system. Research indicates that risk of business process mismatch is decreased by:
* Linking current processes to the organization's strategy
* Analyzing the effectiveness of each process
* Understanding existing automated solutions&lt;ref&gt;King. W., "Ensuring ERP implementation success," ''Information Systems Management'', Summer 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yusuf, Y., A. Gunasekaran, and M. Abthorpe, "Enterprise Information Systems Project Implementation: A Case Study of ERP in Rolls-Royce," ''International Journal of Production Economics'', 87(3), February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

ERP implementation is considerably more difficult (and politically charged) in decentralized organizations, because they often have different processes, business rules, data semantics, authorization hierarchies, and decision centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Requirements Engineering for Cross-organizational ERP Implementation: Undocumented Assumptions and Potential Mismatches | first1=Maya |last1=Daneva |author2=Roel Wieringa |author2-link=Roel Wieringa |publisher=University of Twente |url=http://www.vital-project.org/papers/Daneva-Wieringa-Camera-Ready-RE-Paper.pdf |accessdate=July 12, 2008 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may require migrating some business units before others, delaying implementation to work through the necessary changes for each unit, possibly reducing integration (e.g., linking via [[Master data management]]) or customizing the system to meet specific needs.&lt;ref name="Thomas H. Davenport 1998"&gt;Thomas H. Davenport, "Putting the Enterprise into the Enterprise System", ''Harvard Business Review'', July–August 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

A potential disadvantage is that adopting "standard" processes can lead to a loss of [[competitive advantage]]. While this has happened, losses in one area are often offset by gains in other areas, increasing overall competitive advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Turban et al. (2008). ''Information Technology for Management, Transforming Organizations in the Digital Economy''. Massachusetts: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., p. 320. {{ISBN|978-0-471-78712-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Dehning|Dehning, B.]] and T.Stratopoulos, 'Determinants of a Sustainable Competitive Advantage Due to an IT-enabled Strategy,' Journal of Strategic Information Systems, Vol. 12, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Configuration===
Configuring an ERP system is largely a matter of balancing the way the organization wants the system to work with the way it was designed to work. ERP systems typically include many settings that modify system operations. For example, an organization can select the type of inventory accounting—[[FIFO and LIFO accounting|FIFO or LIFO]]—to use; whether to recognize revenue by geographical unit, product line, or distribution channel; and whether to pay for shipping costs on customer returns.&lt;ref name="Thomas H. Davenport 1998"/&gt;

===Two tier enterprise resource planning===

Two-tier ERP software and hardware lets companies run the equivalent of two ERP systems at once: one at the corporate level and one at the division or subsidiary level. For example, a manufacturing company could use an ERP system to manage across the organization using independent global or regional distribution, production or sales centers, and service providers to support the main company’s customers. Each independent center or subsidiary may have its own [[business model]]s, [[workflow]]s, and [[business process]]es.

Given the realities of globalization, enterprises continuously evaluate how to optimize their regional, divisional, and product or manufacturing strategies to support strategic goals and reduce time-to-market while increasing profitability and delivering value.&lt;ref name="ferdows"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ferdows | first1 = K | year = 1997 | title = Making the most of foreign factories | url = | journal = [[Harvard Business Review]] | volume = 75 | issue = 2| pages = 73–88 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With two-tier ERP, the regional distribution, production, or sales centers and service providers continue operating under their own business model—separate from the main company, using their own ERP systems. Since these smaller companies' processes and workflows are not tied to main company's processes and workflows, they can respond to local business requirements in multiple locations.&lt;ref name="gill"&gt;Gill, R. (2011). "The rise of two-tier ERP." ''Strategic Finance'', 93(5), 35-40, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors that affect enterprises' adoption of two-tier ERP systems include:
* Manufacturing globalization, the economics of sourcing in emerging economies
* Potential for quicker, less costly ERP implementations at subsidiaries, based on selecting software more suited to smaller companies
* Extra effort, (often involving the use of [[Enterprise application integration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceiton.com/CMS/EN/workflow/system-centric-bpms.html#Back-End_EAI |title=Technical Workflows |publisher=[[CEITON]] |accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is required where data must pass between two ERP systems&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, Nigel (2010).[http://www.gartner.com/id=1412121 "Two-Tier ERP Suite Strategy: Considering Your Options."] Gartner Group. July 28, 2010. Retrieved September 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Two-tier ERP strategies give enterprises agility in responding to market demands and in aligning IT systems at a corporate level while inevitably resulting in more systems as compared to one ERP system used throughout the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kovacs | first1 = G. L. | last2 = Paganelli | first2 = P. | year = 2003 | title = A planning and management infrastructure for large, complex, distributed projects&amp;nbsp;— beyond ERP and SCM | url = http://ceit.aut.ac.ir/~sa_hashemi/My Teachings/MS-CEIT-Supply Chain Management/W-Selected Papers for class seminars-last/scm-pm-A planning and management infrastructure for large%2C complex%2Cdistributed projects-beyond ERP and SCM.pdf| journal = Computers in Industry | volume = 51 | issue = 2| pages = 165–165 | doi=10.1016/s0166-3615(03)00034-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Customization===
ERP systems are theoretically based on industry best practices, and their makers intend that organizations deploy them "as is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kraemmerand|first=P.|title=ERP implementation: an integrated process of radical change and continuous learning|journal=Production Planning &amp; Control|year=2003|volume=14|issue=4|pages=228–248|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vilpola|first=Inka Heidi|title=A method for improving ERP implementation success by the principles and process of user-centred design|journal=Enterprise Information Systems|year=2008|volume=2|issue=1|pages=47–76|doi=10.1080/17517570701793848}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ERP vendors do offer customers configuration options that let organizations incorporate their own business rules, but gaps in features often remain even after configuration is complete.

ERP customers have several options to reconcile feature gaps, each with their own pros/cons. Technical solutions include rewriting part of the delivered software, writing a homegrown module to work within the ERP system, or interfacing to an external system. These three options constitute varying degrees of system customization—with the first being the most invasive and costly to maintain.&lt;ref name="Fryling 2010 391–421"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fryling|first=Meg|title=Estimating the impact of enterprise resource planning project management decisions on post-implementation maintenance costs: a case study using simulation modelling|journal=Enterprise Information Systems|year=2010|volume=4|issue=4|pages=391–421|doi=10.1080/17517575.2010.519785|bibcode=2010EntIS...4..391F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, there are non-technical options such as changing business practices or organizational policies to better match the delivered ERP feature set. Key differences between customization and configuration include:

* Customization is always optional, whereas the software must always be configured before use (e.g., setting up cost/profit center structures, organizational trees, purchase approval rules, etc.).
* The software is designed to handle various configurations, and behaves predictably in any allowed configuration.
* The effect of configuration changes on system behavior and performance is predictable and is the responsibility of the ERP vendor. The effect of customization is less predictable. It is the customer's responsibility, and increases testing activities.
* Configuration changes survive upgrades to new software versions. Some customizations (e.g., code that uses pre–defined "hooks" that are called before/after displaying data screens) survive upgrades, though they require retesting. Other customizations (e.g., those involving changes to fundamental data structures) are overwritten during upgrades and must be re-implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yakovlev|first=I.V.|title=An ERP implementation and business process reengineering at a Small University|journal=Educause Quarterly|year=2002|volume=2|pages=52–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Customization advantages include that it:
* Improves user acceptance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fryling|first=Meg|title=Total Cost of Ownership, System Acceptance and Perceived Success of Enterprise Resource Planning Software: Simulating a Dynamic Feedback Perspective of ERP in the Higher Education Environment|year=2010|publisher=ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database|isbn=978-1-109-74428-6|page=403}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Offers the potential to obtain competitive advantage vis-à-vis companies using only standard features

Customization disadvantages include that it may:
* Increase time and resources required to implement and maintain&lt;ref name="Fryling 2010 391–421"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BradfordModern15"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KZRqCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107 |title=Modern ERP: Select, Implement, &amp; Use Today's Advanced Business Systems |author=Bradford, M. |pages=107–108 |year=2015 |isbn=9781312665989 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hinder seamless interfacing/integration between suppliers and customers due to the differences between systems&lt;ref name="BradfordModern15" /&gt;
* Limit the company's ability to upgrade the ERP software in the future&lt;ref name="BradfordModern15" /&gt;
* Create over reliance on customization, undermining the principles of ERP as a standardizing software platform

===Extensions===
ERP systems can be extended with third–party software, often via vendor-supplied interfaces.&lt;ref name="BendolyStrat05"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GAOHQvgpeNYC&amp;pg=PA95 |title=Strategic ERP Extension and Use |last1=Bendoly |first1=E. |last2=Jacobs |first2=F.R. |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=95 |year=2005 |isbn=9780804750981 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LeonERP08"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=95QiBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171 |title=ERP Demystified |author=Leon, A. |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education |pages=170–171 |year=2008 |isbn=9780070656642}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensions offer features such as:&lt;ref name="LeonERP08" /&gt;
* product data management
* product life cycle management
* customer relations management
* [[data mining]]
* e-procurement

===Data migration===
[[Data migration]] is the process of moving, copying, and restructuring data from an existing system to the ERP system. Migration is critical to implementation success and requires significant planning. Unfortunately, since migration is one of the final activities before the production phase, it often receives insufficient attention. The following steps can structure migration planning:&lt;ref name="RamaswamyData07"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.ittoolbox.com/white-papers/backoffice/erp/data-migration-strategies-in-erp-4620/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030160728/http://research.ittoolbox.com/white-papers/backoffice/erp/data-migration-strategies-in-erp-4620/ |title=Data Migration Strategy in ERP |author=Ramaswamy, V.K. |publisher=Information Technology Toolbox, Inc |date=27 September 2007 |archivedate=30 October 2007 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Identify the data to be migrated.
* Determine the migration timing.
* Generate data migration templates for key data components
* Freeze the toolset.
* Decide on the migration-related setup of key business accounts.
* Define [[data archiving]] policies and procedures.

Often, data migration is incomplete because some of the data in the existing system is either incompatible or not needed in the new system. As such, the existing system may need to be kept as an archived database to refer back to once the new ERP system is in place.&lt;ref name="RamaswamyData07" /&gt;

===Advantages===
The most fundamental advantage of ERP is that the integration of myriad business processes saves time and expense. Management can make decisions faster and with fewer errors. Data becomes visible across the organization. Tasks that benefit from this integration include:&lt;ref name="MeerBest05"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9YaMB6tOd5oC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Best Practices in ERP Software Applications |author=Meer, K.H. |pages=59 |year=2005 |isbn=0595345131 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sales forecasting, which allows [[inventory optimization]].
* Chronological history of every transaction through relevant data compilation in every area of operation.
* [[Order tracking]], from acceptance through fulfillment
* Revenue tracking, from [[invoice]] through cash receipt
* Matching [[purchase order]]s (what was ordered), inventory receipts (what arrived), and [[cost]]ing (what the vendor invoiced)

ERP systems centralize business data, which:
* Eliminates the need to synchronize changes between multiple systems—consolidation of finance, marketing, sales, human resource, and manufacturing applications
* Brings legitimacy and transparency to each bit of statistical data
* Facilitates standard [[Product naming convention|product naming/coding]]
* Provides a comprehensive enterprise view (no "islands of information"), making real–time information available to management anywhere, anytime to make proper decisions
* Protects sensitive data by consolidating multiple security systems into a single structure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Katherine |last=Walsh |url=http://www.csoonline.com/article/216940/The_ERP_Security_Challenge |title=The ERP Security Challenge |work=CSOonline |publisher=CXO Media Inc |date=January 2009 |accessdate=January 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===

* ERP can improve quality and efficiency of the business. By keeping a company's internal business processes running smoothly, ERP can lead to better outputs that may benefit the company, such as in customer service and manufacturing.
* ERP  supports upper level management by providing information for decision making.
* ERP creates a more agile company that adapts better to change. It also makes a company more flexible and less rigidly structured so organization components operate more cohesively, enhancing the business—internally and externally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien|first=James|title=Management Information Systems(MIS)|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill, Irwin|location=New York|page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ERP can improve data security in a closed environment. A common control system, such as the kind offered by ERP systems, allows organizations the ability to more easily ensure key company data is not compromised. This changes, however, with a more open environment, requiring further scrutiny of ERP security features and internal company policies regarding security.&lt;ref name="SheSecurity07"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Security for Enterprise Resource Planning Systems |journal=Information Systems Security |last1=She |first1=W. |last2=Thuraisingham |first2=B. |volume=16 |pages=152–163 |year=2007 |doi=10.1080/10658980701401959}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ERP provides increased opportunities for [[collaboration]]. Data takes many forms in the modern enterprise, including documents, files, forms, audio and video, and [[email]]s. Often, each data medium has its own mechanism for allowing collaboration. ERP provides a collaborative platform that lets employees spend more time collaborating on content rather than mastering the learning curve of communicating in various formats across distributed systems.&lt;ref name="LeonERP08" /&gt;

===Disadvantages===
* Customization can be problematic. Compared to the best-of-breed approach, ERP can be seen as meeting an organization’s lowest common denominator needs, forcing the organization to find workarounds to meet unique demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young |first=Joanna |url=http://www.evolllution.com/opinions/audio-best-of-breed-vs-erp-whats-higher-ed-today/ |title=AUDIO &amp;#124; Best-of-Breed vs. ERP: What’s Best for Higher Ed Today? |publisher=The EvoLLLution |accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Business process re-engineering|Re-engineering business processes]] to fit the ERP system may damage competitiveness or divert focus from other critical activities.
* ERP can cost more than less integrated or less comprehensive solutions.
* High ERP [[switching cost]]s can increase the ERP vendor's negotiating power, which can increase support, maintenance, and upgrade expenses.
* Overcoming resistance to sharing sensitive information between departments can divert management attention.
* Integration of truly independent businesses can create unnecessary dependencies.
* Extensive training requirements take resources from daily operations.
* Harmonization of ERP systems can be a mammoth task (especially for big companies) and requires a lot of time, planning, and money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfo-insight.com/reporting-forecasting/forecasting/the-minefield-of-harmonising-erp/ |title=The Minefied of Harmonising ERP |publisher=Cfo-insight.com |date=July 23, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727021524/http://www.cfo-insight.com/reporting-forecasting/forecasting/the-minefield-of-harmonising-erp |archivedate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Postmodern ERP ==
The term "postmodern ERP" was coined by [[Gartner]] in 2013, when it first appeared in the paper series "Predicts 2014".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2633315/predicts--rise-postmodern-erp|title=Predicts 2014: The Rise of the Postmodern ERP and Enterprise Applications World|publisher=Gartner Group|access-date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gartner's definition of the postmodern ERP strategy, [[Legacy system|legacy]], [[Monolithic system|monolithic]] and highly customized ERP suites, in which all parts are heavily reliant on each other, should sooner or later be replaced by a mixture of both cloud-based and on-premises applications, which are more loosely coupled and can be easily exchanged if needed.

The basic idea is that there should still be a core ERP solution that would cover most important business functions, while other functions will be covered by specialist software solutions that merely extend the core ERP. This concept is similar to the so-called best-of-breed approach&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3171517/postmodern-erp-strategy-bestofbreed-approach|title=Postmodern ERP Strategy Is Not a Best-of-Breed Approach|publisher=Gartner Group|access-date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to software implementation, but it shouldn't be confused with it. While in both cases, applications that make up the whole are relatively loosely connected and quite easily interchangeable, in the case of the latter there is no ERP solution whatsoever. Instead, every business function is covered by a separate software solution.

There is, however, no golden rule as to what business functions should be part of the core ERP, and what should be covered by supplementary solutions. According to Gartner, every company must define their own postmodern ERP strategy, based on company's internal and external needs, operations and processes. For example, a company may define that the core ERP solution should cover those business processes that must stay behind the firewall, and therefore, choose to leave their core ERP [[On-premises software|on-premises]]. At the same time, another company may decide to host the core ERP solution in the cloud and move only a few ERP modules as supplementary solutions to on-premises.

The main benefits that companies will gain from implementing postmodern ERP strategy are speed and flexibility when reacting to unexpected changes in business processes or on the organizational level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://enterprise-resource-planning.cioreview.com/cxoinsight/5-factors-facilitating-the-transition-to-the-postmodern-erp-era-nid-7292-cid-96.html|title=5 Factors Facilitating the Transition to the Postmodern ERP Era|newspaper=CIOReview|access-date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the majority of applications having a relatively loose connection, it is fairly easy to replace or upgrade them whenever necessary. In addition to that, following the examples above, companies can select and combine cloud-based and on-premises solutions that are most suited for their ERP needs. The downside of postmodern ERP is that it will most likely lead to an increased number of software vendors that companies will have to manage, as well as pose additional [[Application Integration Architecture|integration]] challenges for the central IT.

'''Entrepreneur in Residence''' or '''Executive in Residence''' is a kind of position in [[venture capital]] firms, [[law firm]]s or [[business school]]s that is usually temporary and not formal. This is when an institution brings in an entrepreneur, who is usually in the process of starting or expanding his/her new company.&lt;ref&gt;An Entrepreneurial Life, (2013).

==Venture Capital firm==
In a Venture Capital firm the entrepreneur is funded to work with some of the [[investment]] team of the company as well as being exposed to business-building processes, where he/she can assist the firm with any existing portfolio. In addition he/she is expected to help the company evaluate new potential investments, especially if it is an area of the E.I.R's experience. 
On the other hand, the company usually benefits from this by getting significant access to the new company started by the E.I.R. This is due to the fact that the company gets to, usually, be the first investor in E.I.R's new company, giving them a chance to influence some company decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Festanstellung - Entrepreneur in Residence (m/w) - München, Berlin - www.etventure.com, (2014).

[online] Available at: http://www.etventure.com/de/festanstellung-entrepreneur-in-residence-muenchen-berlin.html [Accessed 25 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law Firm==
In a law firm scenario, the [[entrepreneur]] is expected to provide services to the firm’s clients who are also involved in entrepreneur activity. 
For a firm having an entrepreneur who can interact with other entrepreneurs and advise them is a way of gaining client trust by helping them with business decisions and networks.
In addition Law firms can also have the previous E.I.Rs as their clients once they start up their company. This is an easy and accessible [[clientele]] with whom the companies had previous relationships. 
This is a very beneficial relationship for the E.I.R, who will develop relationships with several other entrepreneurs, that could be potential partners in the future. The E.I.R gets a chance to show his/her knowledge and understanding to the law firm's client and will develop further relationships with any partners of the client's partner as well.

==Business School==
While in a Business school, an E.I.R is expected to provide guidance to business students who are intending to go through the same path as those who are helping them. The type of nurturing an E.I.R can provide to a 
business school environment helps students, professors or whoever wishes to start a business within the institution environment. The E.I.R helps them develop ideas, organize them and follow the right path towards making these ideas reality.
E.I.Rs are usually interested in these types of opportunities for several reasons, including expanding their own [[Curriculum vitae|CV]] through teaching and influence as well as developing relationships with future business owners who could be future partners of the E.I.R.&lt;ref&gt;http://www..gsb.columbia.edu, (2014).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7969">An '''executive summary''', or '''management summary''', is a short document or section of a document, produced for [[business]] purposes, that summarizes a longer report or proposal or a group of related reports in such a way that readers can rapidly become acquainted with a large body of material without having to read it all. It usually contains a brief statement of the problem or proposal covered in the major document(s), background information, concise analysis and main conclusions. It is intended as an aid to decision-making by managers and has been described as the most important part of a [[business plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writing.colostate.edu/guides/documents/execsum/pop2a.cfm|title=Writing@CSU|website=writing.colostate.edu|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/3660.html|title=Crafting a Powerful Executive Summary|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davelavinsky/2013/12/03/business-plan-outline-23-point-checklist-for-success/|title=Business Plan Outline - 23 Point Checklist For Success|first=Dave|last=Lavinsky|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.changeupmerseyside.org.uk/changeupdocs/CTA%20Business%20Planning%20Guide.pdf|title=Rough Guide to Business Planning|work=Greater Merseyside Changeup|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An executive summary differs from an [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]] in that an abstract will usually be shorter and is typically intended as an overview or orientation rather than being a condensed version of the full document. Abstracts are extensively used in academic research where the concept of the executive summary is not in common usage. "An abstract is a brief summarizing statement... read by parties who are trying to decide whether or not to read the main document", while "an executive summary, unlike an abstract, is a document in miniature that may be read in place of the longer document".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhhe.com/mayfieldpub/tsw/abstract.htm|title=Abstract|website=www.mhhe.com|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
There is general agreement on the structure of an executive summary - books and training courses emphasise similar points.&lt;ref name=greenhall&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenhall|first=Margaret|title=Report Writing Skills Training Course - How to Write a Report and Executive Summary, and Plan, Design and Present Your Report - An Easy Format for ... of Exercises and Free Downloadable Workbook [|year=2010|publisher=Universe of Learning Ltd|isbn=978-1-84937-036-3|url=http://www.uolearn.com/reportwriting/writingexecutivesummaries.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=csuwg&gt;{{cite web|title=Writing Guide: Executive Summaries|url=http://writing.colostate.edu/guides/documents/execsum/index.cfm|publisher=Colorado State University|accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=howe&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Summary |url=http://www.fsb.muohio.edu/fsb/content/programs/howe-writing-initiative/student-resources/Writing%20an%20Executive%20Summary.doc |work=Howe Writing Initiative |publisher=Miami School of Business.

* be approximately 5-10% of the length of the main report&lt;ref name=howe /&gt;&lt;ref name=foster /&gt;
* be written in language appropriate for the target audience&lt;ref name=csuwg /&gt;&lt;ref name=foster /&gt;
* consist of short, concise paragraphs&lt;ref name=csuwg /&gt;&lt;ref name=foster /&gt;
* begin with a summary&lt;ref name=csuwg /&gt;&lt;ref name=foster /&gt;
* be written in the same order as the main report&lt;ref name=greenhall /&gt;&lt;ref name=howe /&gt;
* only include material present in the main report&lt;ref name=greenhall /&gt;&lt;ref name=howe /&gt;
* make recommendations&lt;ref name=csuwg /&gt;&lt;ref name=foster /&gt;
* provide a justification&lt;ref name=csuwg /&gt;&lt;ref name=foster /&gt;
* have a conclusion&lt;ref name=csuwg/&gt;&lt;ref name=howe /&gt;&lt;ref name=foster /&gt;
* be readable separately from the main report&lt;ref name=greenhall /&gt;&lt;ref name=csuwg /&gt;&lt;ref name=howe /&gt;
* sometimes summarize more than one document&lt;ref name=csuwg /&gt;

== Importance ==
Executive summaries are important as a communication tool in both academia and business. For example, members of [[Texas A&amp;M University]] Department of Agricultural Economics observes that "An executive summary is an initial interaction between the writers of the report and their target readers: decision makers, potential customers, and/or peers. A business leader’s decision to continue reading a certain report often depends on the impression the executive summary gives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agecon2.tamu.edu/people/faculty/williams-gary/429/Complete%20Writing%20Guidelines.pdf|title=Texas A&amp;M University Department of Agricultural Economics|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

It has been said that, by providing an easy digest of an often complex matter, an executive summary can lead policy makers and others to overlook important issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/article.aspx?id=409|title=Murky Media|website=www.vision.org|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. Amanda Sinclair of the [[University of Melbourne]] has argued that this is often an active rather than a passive process. In one study, centred on globalization, she found that policy makers face "pressures to adopt a simple reading of complex issues" and "to depoliticise and universalize all sorts of differences". She claims that "all research was framed under pre-defined and generic headings, such as business case points. The partners' reports were supposed to look the same. The standardization of research occurred via vehicles such as executive summaries: “executives only read the summaries” we were told”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan003381.pdf|title="Doing Critical Research for the Government of Australia By Amanda Sinclair"|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly [[Colin Leys]], writing in The [[Socialist Register]], argues that executive summaries are used to present dumbed down arguments:  "there is remarkably little adverse comment on the steep decline that has occurred since 1980 in the quality of government policy documents, whose level of argumentation and use of evidence is all too often inversely related to the quality of their presentation (in the style of corporate reports, complete with executive summaries and flashy graphics)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comunicazione.uniroma1.it/materiali/19.25.02_THE%20CYNICAL%20STATE.doc "The cynical state"  by Colin Lays, Socialist Register 2006 p1-27]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Expert-as-a-Service''' (ExaaS) is an online delivery model of human [[consulting]] and/or automated [[knowledge transfer]]. Similarly to SaaS ([[Software as a service]]) the concept of ExaaS comes from the remote nature of processing data and/or providing service. The user of ExaaS &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thiede |first=Charles |url=http://www.business2community.com/strategy/3-reasons-experts-service-future-consulting-0917775#frvhQ38cJBmi6lHV.97 |title=3 Reasons Why Experts-as-a-Service is the Future of Consulting |publisher=Business2community.com |date=2014-06-17 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; accesses the service through a [[webpage]], [[VoiP]], [[Instant messaging|IM]], etc. or any related [[mobile app]]. Typical ExaaS providers are [[consultants]], [[lawyers]], [[Physician|physicians]], [[teachers]] etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1834">'''Forged endorsement''' is a legal term used to describe a fraudulent payment. For example, someone may write a cheque with a forged signature. In this case the forged signature makes the endorsement fraudulent. Forging endorsements can be use to prevent the person or legal entity that the payment is made out to from being able to receive its value (such as cashing a cheque).

==Legal description==

If an [[Financial instrument|instrument]] is endorsed in full, it cannot be endorsed or negotiated except by an [[Negotiable instrument|endorsement]] signed by the person to whom or to whose order the instrument is payable. Thus, if such an instrument is negotiated by way of a forged endorsement, the endorsee will not acquire the title even though he be a purchaser for value and in good faith, because the endorsement is [[Legal nullity|nullity]]. But where the instrument has been endorsed in blank, it can be negotiated by mere delivery and the holder derives his title independent of the forged endorsement and can claim the amount from any of the parties to the instrument.

== Examples==
A bill is endorsed, “payable to X or order”. X endorses it in blank and it comes into the hands of Y, who simply delivers it to A. A would then forge Y's endorsement and transfers it to B. B, as the holder, does not derive his title through the forged endorsement to Y, but through the genuine endorsement of X and can claim payment from any of the parties to the instrument in spite of the intervening forged endorsement.

[[File:IFSA Network.png|thumb|IFSA Network Logo]]

The '''IFSA Network''' (previously known as the International Finance Students Association&lt;ref name="IFSA Network"&gt;{{cite web |title=IFSA Network Website |url=http://ifsa-network.com/ |website=IFSA Network |publisher=WordPress |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a global [[non-profit organization]] entirely run by students. Its main aim is to give students in the fields of finance, economics, management and engineering, a path to enter the professional world of [[finance]] by providing them with lectures, workshops, competitions and connecting them through a global network.

== History ==
The IFSA Network was founded in 2014 in [[Rotterdam]],&lt;ref name="IFSA Network: Letter to Stakeholders"&gt;{{cite web |title=IFSA Network: Letter to Stakeholders |url=http://ifsa-network.com/letter-to-stakeholders-16/ |website=IFSA Network: Letter to Stakeholders |publisher=WordPress |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Rotterdam School of Management]]. Its first focus was to regroup people studying Finance, and connect them both between themselves and established financial actors. It quickly spread across Europe and Asia, before opening chapters in South Africa and the Americas.

== Concept ==
The IFSA Network is composed of different chapters throughout the world. The concept is to have semi-independent units,&lt;ref name="IFSA Network: Who Are We"&gt;{{cite web |title=IFSA Network: Who Are We |url=http://ifsa-network.com/who-are-we/ |website=IFSA Network: Who Are We |publisher=WordPress |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; each composed of their own board &amp; active members and to create synergy between these in order to provide the best opportunities to their members. The objective of the association is to build a comprehensive network that connects finance students across the globe and enable them to interact and communicate with each other.

== Hierarchy ==
Each chapter has a board, composed of a Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Treasure and General Secretary. This board manages day to day operations locally and supervises its regional activities. Chapters also typically have departments (Finance, Marketing, Events), with a department head managing the analysts.
Chairmen also regularly connect to establish international strategies and overview national operations.

== Current Chapters ==
As of 2017, The IFSA Network has the following chapters:

=== Local Venues ===
The various IFSA Network chapters try to offer their communities various local events to connect with the professional world.&lt;ref name="Geneva Students"&gt;{{cite web |title=Geneva students are hungry and getting prepared to face the challenges ! |url=https://www.notzstucki.com/ifsa-event-geneva-students-are-hungry-and-getting-prepared-to-face-the-challenges/ |website=NOTZ STUCKI |publisher=NOTZ STUCKI |accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, an industry professional will come to the IFSA Network events and meet students. The purpose of those venues is to give students a taste of the professional world, share tips and knowledge, and give an opportunity to network.

=== Boston Consulting Group Case competition ===
In 2018, the IFSA Network in cooperation with the [[Boston Consulting Group]] and InvestSoc, organised the first, three-week long International Cape Town Case Competition. The competition has a unique format where teams consisting of 2 to 4 participants, propose solutions for crises that are presented to them. In their solutions, participants are able to showcase their knowledge, creativity and problem-solving skills on a current macroeconomic issue. 
A jury picks the 15 best international teams and the best local teams, from Cape Town. The selected teams arrive in [[Cape Town, South Africa]], to participate in the second round, and present in front of a select panel of distinguished professors and practitioners. The winning team is awarded a cash prize of 5000 South African Rand.

== Network Creation ==
The IFSA Network is very selective when it comes to opening chapters and selecting board members. Striving for excellency, it will only open chapters in elite universities, and hires only the most ambitious and brightest students. The purpose of this is to ensure smooth operations and maintain a high-level of execution in all of the organisation’s activities. Ultimately, the goal is to have establishments around the world, regrouping all major academic institutions.

{{Labour|sp=Oxford|expanded=academic}}
'''Industrial relations''' or '''employment relations''' is the multidisciplinary academic field that studies the employment relationship;{{sfnm |1a1=Ackers |1y=2002 |2a1=Kaufman |2y=2004 |2p=94}} that is, the complex interrelations between [[employer]]s and [[employee]]s, [[labor union|labor/trade union]]s, [[employer organization]]s and [[the state]]. 

The newer name, "employment relations" is increasingly taking precedence because "industrial relations" is often seen to have relatively narrow connotations.{{sfn|Lewis|Thornhill|Saunders|2003|p=3}} Nevertheless, industrial relations has frequently been concerned with employment relationships in the broadest sense, including "non-industrial" employment relationships. This is sometimes seen as paralleling a trend in the separate but related  disciple of [[human resource management]].{{sfn|Banfield|Kay|2008|p=114}}

While some scholars regard or treat industrial/employment relations as synonymous with '''employee relations''' and [[labour relations]], this is controversial, because of the narrower focus of employee/labour relations, i.e. on employees or labour, from the perspective of employers, managers and/or officials. In addition, employee relations is often perceived as dealing only with non-unionized workers, whereas labour relations is seen as dealing with [[Portal:Organized_Labour|organized labour]], i.e unionized workers.&lt;ref name="OgilvieCooper2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ogilvie |first=John R. |year=2006 |title=CLEP Principles of Management |location=Piscataway, New Jersey |publisher=Research &amp; Education Association |isbn=978-0-7386-0125-0 |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=July 2018}} Some academics, universities and other institutions regard human resource management as synonymous with one or more of the above disciplines,{{sfn|Rose|2008}} although this too is controversial.

== Overview ==
Industrial relations examines various employment situations, not just ones with a unionized workforce. However, according to Bruce E. Kaufman, "To a large degree, most scholars regard [[trade union|trade unionism]], [[collective bargaining]] and labour–[[management]] relations, and the national labour policy and [[labour law]] within which they are embedded, as the core subjects of the field."{{sfn|Kaufman|2008|p=31}}

Initiated in the United States at end of the 19th century, it took off as a field in conjunction with the [[New Deal]]. However, it is generally regarded as a separate field of study only in English-speaking countries, having no direct equivalent in continental Europe.{{sfn|Ackers|2002}} In recent times, industrial relations has been in decline as a field, in correlation with the decline in importance of trade unions{{sfn|Kaufman|2008|p=31}} and also with the increasing preference of [[business school]]s for the human resource management paradigm.{{sfn|Taras|2008|p=124}}

[[File:Ir rally img 3870.jpg|thumb|Protest against industrial relations legislation in Melbourne in 2005.]]

Industrial relations has three faces: science building, problem solving, and ethical.{{sfn|Kaufman|2004|p=94}} In the science building phase, industrial relations is part of the [[social science]]s, and it seeks to understand the [[employment]] relationship and its institutions through high-quality, rigorous research. In this vein, industrial relations scholarship intersects with scholarship in [[labour economics]], [[industrial sociology]], [[labour history (discipline)|labour]] and [[social history]], [[human resource management]], [[political science]], [[law]], and other areas.

Industrial relations scholarship assumes that labour markets are not perfectly competitive and thus, in contrast to mainstream [[economic theory]], employers typically have greater bargaining power than employees. Industrial relations scholarship also assumes that there are at least some inherent conflicts of interest between employers and employees (for example, higher wages versus higher profits) and thus, in contrast to scholarship in human resource management and [[organizational behaviour]], conflict is seen as a natural part of the employment relationship. Industrial relations scholars therefore frequently study the diverse institutional arrangements that characterize and shape the employment relationship—from norms and power structures on the shop floor, to employee voice mechanisms in the workplace, to [[collective bargaining]] arrangements at company, regional, or national level, to various levels of public policy and [[labour law]] regimes,{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} to varieties of [[capitalism]]{{sfn|Hamann|Kelly|2008|p=129}} (such as [[corporatism]], [[social democracy]], and [[neoliberalism]]).

When labour markets are seen as imperfect, and when the employment relationship includes conflicts of interest, then one cannot rely on markets or [[manager]]s to always serve workers' interests, and in extreme cases to prevent worker exploitation. Industrial relations scholars and practitioners, therefore, support institutional interventions to improve the workings of the employment relationship and to protect workers' rights. The nature of these institutional interventions, however, differ between two camps within industrial relations.{{sfn|Budd|Bhave|2008}} The pluralist camp sees the employment relationship as a mixture of shared interests and conflicts of interests{{sfn|Budd|Bhave|2008|p=104}} that are largely limited to the employment relationship. In the workplace, pluralists, therefore, champion [[grievance (labour)|grievance]] procedures, [[employee voice]] mechanisms such as [[works council]]s and [[trade union]]s, collective bargaining, and labour–management partnerships. In the policy arena, pluralists advocate for [[minimum wage]] laws, [[occupational health and safety]] standards, [[international labour standards]], and other employment and labour laws and public policies.{{sfn|Befort|Budd|2009}} These institutional interventions are all seen as methods for balancing the employment relationship to generate not only economic efficiency but also employee equity and  voice.{{sfn|Budd|2004}} In contrast, the [[Marxism|Marxist]]-inspired critical camp sees employer–employee conflicts of interest as sharply antagonistic and deeply embedded in the socio-political-economic system. From this perspective, the pursuit of a balanced employment relationship gives too much weight to employers' interests, and instead deep-seated structural reforms are needed to change the sharply antagonistic employment relationship that is inherent within capitalism. Militant trade unions are thus frequently supported.

== History ==
Industrial relations has its roots in the [[industrial revolution]] which created the modern employment relationship by spawning free labour markets and large-scale industrial organizations with thousands of wage workers.{{sfn|Kaufman|2004|pp=15–16}} As society wrestled with these massive economic and social changes, labour problems arose. Low wages, long working hours, monotonous and dangerous work, and abusive supervisory practices led to high employee turnover, violent [[strike action|strikes]], and the threat of social instability. Intellectually, industrial relations was formed at the end of the 19th century as a middle ground between classical economics and [[Marxian economics|Marxism]],{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} with [[Sidney Webb]] and [[Beatrice Webb]]'s ''[[Industrial Democracy]]'' (1897) being a key intellectual work.{{sfn|Farnham|2008}} Industrial relations thus rejected the classical econ.

Institutionally, industrial relations was founded by [[John R. Commons]] when he created the first academic industrial relations program at the [[University of Wisconsin]] in 1920.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Another scholarly pioneer in industrial relations and labour research was [[Robert F. Hoxie]].{{sfn|Kuhn|Lewin|McNulty|1983|p=157}} Early financial support for the field came from [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] who supported progressive labour–management relations in the aftermath of the [[Ludlow Massacre|bloody strike at a Rockefeller-owned coal mine in Colorado]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} In Britain, another progressive industrialist, [[Montague Burton]], endowed chairs in industrial relations at the universities of [[University of Leeds|Leeds]], [[Cardiff University|Cardiff]], and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in 1929–1930.{{sfn|Sigsworth|1990|p=124}}

Beginning in the early 1930s there was a rapid increase in membership of [[labor unions in the United States|trade unions in the United States]], and with that came frequent and sometimes violent labour–management conflict.{{sfn|Kaufman|1993|pp=61–62}} During the [[Second World War]] these were suppressed by the arbitration powers of the [[National War Labor Board (1942–1945)|National War Labor Board]].{{sfn|Kaufman|1993|p=62}}

However, as the Second World War drew to a close and in anticipation of a renewal of labour–management conflict after the war, there was a wave of creations of new academic institutes and degree programs that sought to analyse such conflicts and the role of collective bargaining.{{sfn|Kaufman|1993|pp=61–67, 80–81}} The most known of these was the [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]], founded in 1945.{{sfn|Kaufman|1993|p=63}}&lt;ref name="nyt-1947"/&gt;  But counting various forms, there were over seventy-five others.&lt;ref name="nyt-1947"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fine |first=Benjamin |author-link=Benjamin Fine |date=9 February 1947 |title=Growth and Variety of University Programs in Labor Studies Shown in a Survey |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1947/02/09/archives/growth-and-variety-of-university-programs-in-labor-studies-shown-in.html |url-access=subscription |newspaper=The New York Times |page=E9 |access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included the [[Yale Labor and Management Center]], directed by [[E. Wight Bakke]], which began in 1945.&lt;ref name="nyt-1946"&gt;{{cite news |last=Porter |first=Russell |date=15 July 1946 |title=Behavior Studied for Labor Peace |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1946/07/15/archives/behavior-studied-for-labor-peace-research-by-new-unit-at-yale-seeks.html |url-access=subscription |newspaper=The New York Times |page=23 |access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An influential industrial relations scholar in the 1940s and 1950s was [[Neil W. Chamberlain]] at [[Yale University|Yale]] and [[Columbia University|Columbia]] universities.{{sfn|Kuhn|Lewin|McNulty|1983}} 

In the 1950s, industrial relations was formalized as a distinct academic discipline with the emergence in the UK of the so-called "Oxford school", including {{ill|Allan Flanders|de}}, [[Hugh Clegg (industrial relations)|Hugh Clegg]],{{sfn|Ackers|Wilkinson|2005|p=446}} and [[Alan Fox (sociologist)|Alan Fox]], Lord [[William McCarthy, Baron McCarthy|William McCarthy]], Sir [[George Bain (academic)|George Bain]] (all of whom taught at [[Nuffield College, Oxford]]), as well as [[Otto Kahn-Freund]] ([[Brasenose College, Oxford]]).

Industrial relations was formed with a strong problem-solving orientation{{sfn|Kaufman|1993|p=187}} that rejected both the classical economists' ''[[laissez-faire]]'' solutions to labour problems and the Marxist solution of [[class revolution]]. It is this approach that underlies the [[New Deal]] legislation in the United States, such as the [[National Labor Relations Act]] and the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]].

By the early 21st century, the academic field of industrial relations was often described as being in crisis.{{sfnm |1a1=Ackers |1y=2002 |2a1=Kaufman |2y=2004 |3a1=Whalen |3y=2008}} In academia, its traditional positions are threatened on one side by the dominance of mainstream economics and organizational behaviour, and on the other by [[postmodernism]]. 

In policy-making circles, the industrial relations emphasis on institutional intervention is trumped by a neoliberal emphasis on the ''laissez-faire'' promotion of [[free market]]s. In practice, trade unions are declining and fewer companies have industrial relations functions.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The number of academic programs in industrial relations is therefore shrinking, while fields such as human resource management and organizational behaviour grow.{{sfn|Kaufman|1993|pp=189, 192}} The importance of this work, however, is stronger than ever, and the lessons of industrial relations remain vital. The challenge for industrial relations is to re-establish these connections with the broader academic, policy, and business worlds.

== Theoretical perspectives ==
Industrial relations scholars such as Alan Fox have described three major theoretical perspectives or frameworks, that contrast in their understanding and analysis of workplace relations. The three views are generally known as unitarism, pluralism, and the radical or critical school. Each offers a particular perception of workplace relations and will, therefore, interpret such events as workplace conflict, the role of unions and job regulation differently. The perspective of the critical school is sometimes referred to as the ''[[conflict theories|conflict]] model'', although this is somewhat ambiguous, as pluralism also tends to see conflict as inherent in workplaces. Radical theories are strongly identified with [[Marxist theory|Marxist theories]], although they are not limited to these.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

=== Pluralist perspective ===
In pluralism, the organization is perceived as being made up of {{citation needed span |date=July 2018 |text=powerful and}} divergent sub-groups, each with its own legitimate interests{{sfn|Calveley|Allsop|Rocha Lawton|Huesmann|2017|p=290}} and loyalties and with their own set of objectives and leaders. In particular, the two predominant sub-groups in the pluralist perspective are the management and trade unions. The pluralist perspective also supports that conflict is inherent in dealing with industrial relations since different sub-groups have different opinions in the day-to-day operations.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Consequently, the role of management would lean less towards enforcing and controlling and more toward persuasion and coordination.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Trade unions are deemed as legitimate representatives of employees,{{sfn|Calveley|Allsop|Rocha Lawton|Huesmann|2017|p=290}} conflict is dealt by collective bargaining and is viewed not necessarily as a bad thing and, if managed, could, in fact, be channeled towards evolution and positive change. It is the opposite of the unitary approach, there are different the group within the environment. Hence, the interest of employers and employee are divergent.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The employers want to maximize profit {{citation needed span |date=July 2018 |text=at the expenses of employees}} and employees want to enjoy social benefits in the form of increased wages,{{sfn|Calveley|Allsop|Rocha Lawton|Huesmann|2017|p=290}} conducive environment. Therefore, conflict is inevitable and the need for the trade union to protect the interest of both parties. Also, there is dual authority/loyalty in this approach. Therefore, employees are loyal to the management as well as their labour leaders.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

=== Unitarist perspective ===
In unitarism, the organization is perceived as an integrated and harmonious whole with the idea of "one happy family" in which management and other members of the staff all share a common purpose by emphasizing mutual co-operation.{{sfn|Zhang|2014|p=228}}&lt;!-- NOTE: This sentence appears to have been lifted by Zhang from Wikipedia rather than the other way around. --&gt; Furthermore, unitarism has a paternalistic approach: it demands loyalty of all employees{{sfn|Zhang|2014|p=228}} and is managerial in its emphasis and application.{{sfn|Barchiesi|2014|p=243}} Consequently, trade unions are deemed as unnecessary{{sfn|Budd|Bhave|2008|pp=92–93, 103}} since the loyalty between employees and organizations are considered mutually exclusive, and there cannot be two sides of industry.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Conflict is perceived as {{citation needed span |date=July 2018 |text=destructive and}} the result of poor management.{{sfn|Budd|Bhave|2008|p=103}}

=== Radical or critical perspective ===
This view of industrial relations looks at the nature of the capitalist society, where there is a fundamental division of interest between capital and labour, and sees workplace relations against this background. This perspective sees inequalities of power and economic wealth as having their roots in the nature of the capitalist economic system.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Conflict is therefore seen as a natural outcome of capitalism, thus it is inevitable and trade unions are a natural response of workers{{sfn|Zhang|2014|p=228}} to their exploitation by capital. Whilst there may be periods of acquiescence, the Marxist view would be that institutions of joint regulation would enhance rather than limit management's position as they presume the continuation of capitalism rather than challenge it.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9654">A '''Local information system''' ('''LIS''') is a form of [[information system]] built with [[business intelligence tools]], designed primarily to support geographic [[report]]ing. They overlap with some capabilities of [[geographic information system]]s (GIS), although their primary function is the reporting of [[statistical data]] rather than the analysis of [[geospatial data]]. LIS also tend to offer some common [[knowledge management]] functionality for storage and retrieval of [[unstructured data]] such as documents. They deliver functionality to load, store, analyse and present statistical data that has a strong geographic reference. In most cases the data is structured as indicators and is linked to discrete geographic areas, for example population figures for [[County (United States)|US counties]] or numbers claiming [[unemployment benefit]] across [[Ward (country subdivision)|wards]] in [[England]]. The ability to present this data using data visualization tools like charts and maps is also a core feature of these systems.

The term "LIS" has emerged since 2004, primarily in the [[UK public sector]]. To date it is not widely used elsewhere although other terms like '''Community Information Systems''' apply to solutions, primarily in North America, that have a great deal of overlap. Another widely used and largely synonymous term is '''Data Observatory'''. Data Observatory is a more widely used term internationally particularly within the area of public health where sites which often include this type of statistical reporting application are often termed a [[health observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apho.org.uk/ Association of Public Health Observatories]&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary application for LIS is to provide a place-focused evidence base that is easily accessible to a wide range of users including data experts, managers, policy makers, front-line staff and citizens. They provide a wide range of statistics and reports allowing users to review the current evidence base and build a picture of localities and neighbourhoods for their area of interest. LIS are commonly used by partnerships where they need to come together to provide joined-up services for a common area. The ability to have a common evidence base and a platform to share sensitive and non-sensitive data is critical in this situation. LIS enables partners to publish a wide range of indicators in the form of defined outputs which combine locally and nationally available data into more meaningful intelligence aimed at specific user groups

== Background ==

In the UK, like many other countries, there has been a rapid growth in the availability of small area statistics. National [[Neighbourhood Statistics]] projects across the UK, set up as a result of the PAT 18 report,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/social_exclusion_task_force/assets/publications_1997_to_2006/pat_report_18.pdf Cabinet Office PAT 18 Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703112129/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/social_exclusion_task_force/assets/publications_1997_to_2006/pat_report_18.pdf |date=2009-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have opened up access to a wide range of government small area based statistics. This has been accompanied by a gradual shift across the public sector, a shift that remains very much on-going, towards the recognition that policy and decisions should be influenced to a greater degree by evidence. There also continues to be a growing acceptance that some services can be more effectively delivered by targeting resources at specific areas of need − the idea of high demand 'hotspots'. This relies on having reliable and detailed data about the needs of customers, in this case citizens, and where they live, work and take leisure time. 

In England in particular this has led to a rapid increase in the number of Local Information Systems particularly within local Authorities and Local Strategic Partnerships. This development has been actively supported by the Department of Communities and Local Government (CLG) under their ‘Neighbourhood Renewal’ agenda. A national research project was funded to identify examples and disseminate best practice – this reported publicly in 2004 and led to a more formal report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/localinformationsystems Local Information Systems: A review of their role, characteristics and benefits] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815070807/http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/localinformationsystems |date=2009-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; being published in 2006. CLG’s role as a catalyst in this area is further re-enforced through its provision of Neighbourhood Renewal Funds (NRF) - this funding was used by a number of authorities to pump-prime their initial LIS developments.

An initiative is currently on-going through the CLG Information Management Programme to coordinate all LIS activity across local government and partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esd.org.uk/esdtoolkit/Communities/LIS/ContentView.aspx?ContentType=Content-287 CLG LIS Resources Home page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625045528/http://www.esd.org.uk/esdtoolkit/Communities/LIS/ContentView.aspx?ContentType=Content-287 |date=2009-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to regular national LIS meetings and a dedicated LIS forum. To date it is estimated that approximately 50 per cent of top tier authorities in England now have some form of LIS. In some cases these have been built as bespoke solutions, in other cases they are based on off-the-shelf products. Elsewhere within the UK this figure is lower although an initiative has been launched in Scotland in 2009 resulting in a Scottish LIS Toolkit&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.improvementservice.org.uk/resources/toolkits/ Improvement Service LIS Toolkit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914234626/http://www.improvementservice.org.uk/resources/toolkits/ |date=2009-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to complement the English version.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esd.org.uk/esdtoolkit/Communities/LIS/ContentView.aspx?ContentType=Content-372 CLG LIS Toolkit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208162003/http://www.esd.org.uk/esdtoolkit/Communities/LIS/ContentView.aspx?ContentType=Content-372 |date=2008-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data ==
The range of data managed within a LIS can be wide and classified in many different ways. Most common is some form of domain specific classification where indicators are grouped into top level categories like ‘Demography’, ‘Health and Welfare’, ‘Crime and Community Safety’, ‘Education and Children's Services’, ‘Environment’ and ‘Economy’. There may also be cross-cutting themes such as ‘Performance’ and ‘Social Disadvantage’. In the UK key government data sources include ONS Neighbourhood Statistics, CLG, Dept for Work and Pensions, NOMIS, Audit Commission and several areas of NHS information services. However the real value of LIS is their ability to combine national data with local data available from a wide range of internal business systems including those of partners. This local data is often not provided to central government and, even when it is, it tends to be in a form that limits its value.

'''NxTier''', is an [[application service provider|ASP]] company that provided software solutions to the [[logistics]] and [[supply chain]] industry. Using their VSC platform, the industry has visibility and control of their data virtually anywhere in the world at any time. The VSC platform is an [[application service provider|ASP]] application deployed over the [[Internet]].
The platform allows logistic and supply chain industry providers to schedule and dispatch [[transportation management system]], accept and transmit [[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]], provide Web tracking functionality, manage orders with the [[order management system|OMS]] , perform [[business analytics]] and consolidate and optimize orders and loads.

The system was originally created specifically for the [[third-party logistics]] (3PL) market. Later it was quickly adopted by the specialized delivery, home delivery and the [[less than truckload]] (LTL) markets. Today it has furthered it reach to full [[truckload carrier]] market, the service industry; dispatch and scheduling, retail build out, appliance and furniture as well as retail replenishment. As the internet became a more reliable platform NxTier positioned its VSC platform to compete in the EDI space to reduce or eliminate [[value added network]] (VAN) based fees.
Nxtier VSC (Visibility, Synchronization, Control)  platform provides multiple components of an [[List of ERP software packages|ERP]] system. It also provides interfaces to other platforms and systems.

The platform is Internet-based, ERP and can be accessed with any internet connection.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.promaras.com/samples/NxTier_pres.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://japan.internet.com/ecnews/20000502/7.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*The main components of the system:
*Online order Management System (OOMS)
*Execution Management System (EMS)
*Warehouse Management System (WMS)
*Transportation Management System(TMS)
*Integration &amp; Execution Management (IEM)
*Time Management (T&amp;E)
*Scheduling (SMS)
*Load Optimization (FOS)

== History ==

Founded in 1994, in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], to help the transportation industry increase visibility into the supply chain by giving them greater visibility and Control over their IT functions and data.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3562">The '''Open Angel Forum''' is a recurring event designed to aid early stage [[startup company|startup companies]] seeking funding, via presentations to prospective [[angel investors]].

Launched in 2009 by tech entrepreneur and media figure [[Jason Calacanis]], the event was the culmination of a series of public comments by Calacanis questioning the ethics of groups who charge fledgling companies to present to wealthy investors.&lt;ref&gt;https://venturebeat.com/2009/12/06/serial-entropr-calacanis-launches-open-angel-forum-a-free-access-to-investors-program/&lt;/ref&gt; Calacanis, already co-founder of startup competition TechCrunch50 with [[Michael Arrington]] (which ran from 2007-2009),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2363693,00.asp&lt;/ref&gt; had spoken out repeatedly against specific groups he characterized as preying on small, hopeful companies seeking financing.

The conversation evolved quickly over the course of several days, beginning with a [http://calacanis.com/2009/10/05/jason-jihad-keiretsu-forum-must-be-stopped/ blog post] calling for "[[Jihad]]" against the [[Keiretsu Forum]], a discussion on his online broadcast This Week in Startups,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/2010/02/open-angel-forum-sf-ny.php&lt;/ref&gt; and two impassioned polemics outlining the impetus for creating an alternative model: the [http://calacanis.com/2009/10/09/why-startups-shouldnt-have-to-pay-to-pitch-angel-investors/ first] self-described as "declaring war" and "written with boiling blood" quickly followed by a [http://calacanis.com/2009/10/13/and-now-some-smoking-guns-or-part-two-of-angels-that-charge/ second] containing quotes from other prominent tech industry pundits such as [[Fred Wilson (financier)|Fred Wilson]] and Brad Feld as well as anonymous individuals claiming to be formerly affiliated or familiar with the groups in question.

Upon formalizing the organization, several principles were outlined regarding qualifications and structure, the most notable legacy of the initial controversy being a strict rule against fees for both presenters and investors for participation.&lt;ref&gt;http://openangelforum.com/2009/12/27/oaf-update-more-events-local-chapters-and-oaf-mission-statement/&lt;/ref&gt; Startups presenting at the Open Angel Forum are picked by the event's organizers (which include regional "chapter heads" as well). Six companies are chosen and each presents for 10 minutes. Angel investors must apply for admission as well, and required to be active, with at least four investments in the past year. The first event was held on January 14, 2009 in Los Angeles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openangelforum.com/2009/12/04/about-the-open-angel-forum/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531190926/http://openangelforum.com/2009/12/04/about-the-open-angel-forum/ |archivedate=2010-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to date events have been held in six cities: [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], [[Palo Alto]], [[Boston]], [[Boulder, CO]] and [[New York City]].

Though news reports and blog postings by participating companies, as well as the organization itself, have touted funding offers following the events, the group does not maintain a comprehensive list of presenters, nor have they announced the success rate or other metrics as to the efficacy of the program as a source for startup capital for participants.

The general purpose of PRM is to enable vendors to better manage their partners through the introduction of reliable systems, processes and procedures for interacting with them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svcawards.com/files/Forrester%20Wave%20PRM%20Q4%202013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/sales-focused-partner-relationship-management-prm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/partner-relationship-management&lt;/ref&gt; Web-based PRM systems typically include a [[Content Management System]], a partner and customer contact database, and the notion of a partner portal which allows partners to log in and interact with a [[vendor]]'s sales opportunity database and obtain product, pricing, and training information. There are a number of solution providers who offer PRM software companies who rely heavily on a PRM solution to stay relevant in their respective industries.

Vendors who implement a PRM solution are typically motivated by a need to reduce the financial overhead and establish new partnerships to drive channel revenue and scale.  Partners may also be integrators or managed service providers.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.compubase.net/Partners-Resellers-ISVs-MSPs-Integrators-lists-for-business_a272.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike [[Customer relationship management|CRM]] systems, which are tailored toward getting an end customer to purchase from you, a PRM system is focused on getting a partner to sell on your behalf.  As a result, they commonly offer web-based self-service tools, information, and resources to partner resellers. Tools often include:
* [[Market development funds|MDF]] Request Programs
* Training, [[Certification]], and [[Accreditation]] Automation
* [[Qualified prospect|Deal]] Registration Programs
* Indirect [[Sales process|Sales Pipeline]] Reporting
* Joint [[Business Plan]]ning
* [[Bounty (reward)|Reward]] and [[Loyalty Program]]s
* [[Digital library|Content Library]]

==Trends==

Gartner reports that PRM solutions have mainly been adopted by companies in the hardware technology, software technology, telecommunication, and manufacturing industries.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gartner.com/technology/media-products/newsletters/impartner/1-34MYI19/gartner.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The PRM application market has expanded significantly in the last 10 years, with vendors offering improved end-to-end and point solutions for the management of channel sales partners.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gartner.com/technology/media-products/newsletters/impartner/1-34MYI19/gartner.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25187">'''Process capital''' is the value to an [[Business|enterprise]] which is derived from the techniques, procedures, and programs that implement and enhance the delivery of [[goods and services]].  Process capital is one of the three components of [[structural capital]], itself a component of [[intellectual capital]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Edvinsson L, Malone MS (1997) Intellectual capital: realizing your company’s true value by finding its hidden roots. HarperBusiness, New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://staffweb.hkbu.edu.hk/vwschow/lectures/ism3620/rp01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Process capital can be seen as the value of processes to any entity, whether for profit or not-for profit, but is most commonly used in reference to for-profit entities.

A process comprises a "series or network of value-added activities, performed by their relevant roles or collaborators, to purposefully achieve the common business goal.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan K. L.

== Roots ==

=== Process Capital in Organisations ===
Organisations invest in process capital in order to build a company’s unique infrastructure for achieving operational and strategic goals. Given the dynamics of industry and technology, the development of process capital evolves and interacts with environmental changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shang, S. and Lin, S.-F. (2010) Barriers to Implementing ITIL—A Multi-Case Study on the Service-Based Industry. Contemporary Management Research, 6, 56-70.{{!}}Reference{{!}}Scientific Research Publish|url = http://www.ljemail.org/reference/ReferencesPapers.aspx?ReferenceID=1353902|website = www.ljemail.org|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisations have invested in information technology (IT) and organisational change programs to build process capital for achieving business excellence through customer satisfaction. The vast investments include: [[IT infrastructure]] implementation, [[quality improvement|quality-improvement]] projects, process-redesign projects, and various process integration projects. Although process capital plays an important role in organising resources, processing information, interacting with stakeholders, and delivering organisational values,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The intellectual capital dimensions of ducati's turnaround: exploring knowledge assets grounding a change management program|url = http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S1363919608001935|journal = International Journal of Innovation Management|date = 2008-06-01|issn = 1363-9196|pages = 161–193|volume = 12|issue = 02|doi = 10.1142/S1363919608001935|first = Giovanni|last = Schiuma|first2 = Antonio|last2 = Lerro|first3 = Damiano|last3 = Sanitate}}&lt;/ref&gt; few studies have discussed its specific content, and it is rare to focus attention on the level of its management. Instead, process capital has usually been hidden in the measurement of IT investment or organisational intellectual capital as an intangible element of organisational assets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Failure to treat process capital as a separate and unique management issue is widespread among both businesses and researchers because most of the systems and processes within the organisations are interdependent. Therefore, a systematic approach to measuring process capital is necessary in order to manage process potential to its full extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How knowledge assets lead to a sustainable competitive advantage: are organizational capabilities a missing link?|url = http://www.palgrave-journals.com/kmrp/journal/v7/n4/abs/kmrp200926a.html|journal = Knowledge Management Research &amp; Practice|date = 2009-01-01|issn = 1477-8238|pages = 339–355|volume = 7|issue = 4|doi = 10.1057/kmrp.2009.26|first = Karim|last = Moustaghfir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Definition ===
[[Capital (economics)|Capital]] is something owned which provides ongoing services. In the national accounts, or to firms, capital is made up of durable investment goods, normally summed in units of money. Process capital, in practice, embraces the practical knowledge of operations, techniques, and employee programs in the effort to extend and enhance the efficiency of manufacturing or the delivery of products and services for long-term value.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Failure to treat process capital as a separate and unique management issue is widespread among both businesses and researchers because most of the systems and processes within the organisations are interdependent. Therefore, a systematic approach to measuring process capital is necessary in order to manage process potential to its full extent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Strategy Development ==
Process capital is essential for strategy development and implementation. Business processes are large with technology, location and other factors combining to generate limitless possibilities. Throughout the process of developing and appropriating technology-enabled processes, collective brainpower is formalised, captured, and leveraged to produce an asset of higher value and affect organisational performance in all aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Knowledge Driven Service Innovation and Management: IT Strategies for Business Alignment and Value Creation: IT Strategies for Business Alignment and Value Creation|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uc2v0omGt5oC|publisher = IGI Global|date = 2012-11-30|isbn = 9781466625136|first = Chew, Eng|last = K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organisational Performance ===
Organisational performance can include the operational, managerial, and strategic impacts of different business efforts on the management of business processes. However, because organisational performance is influenced by numerous factors, the benefits from process capital can be expected to take up to several years to filter through the various levels of business performance. For example, a process integration technology may take months to develop and transform into real processes and to generate increased productivity. In addition, after processes emerge into business operation, greater managerial and strategic performance may appear later. Therefore, it is important to use proper measures to reflect process value for both the short and long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Performance of organisations treating lean as an ideology|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/14637151111182729|journal = Business Process Management Journal|pages = 986–1011|volume = 17|issue = 6|doi = 10.1108/14637151111182729|first = Sanjay|last = Bhasin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring process capital ==

=== Input Method ===
The input method is measured by the resources invested in process capital for business operations. In economic terms, this is expected to predict the future value of the processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Measuring process capital from a system model perspective|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/BPMJ-11-2012-0117|journal = Business Process Management Journal|pages = 662–679|volume = 19|issue = 4|doi = 10.1108/bpmj-11-2012-0117|first = Shari S.C.|last = Shang|first2 = Ya‐Ling|last2 = Wu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two measurement indicators for this method are investment in information technology and administrative expanses.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Intellectual Capital: Realizing Your Company's True Value by Finding Its Hidden Brainpower|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fJWgQgAACAAJ|publisher = HarperCollins|date = 1997-03-06|isbn = 9780887308413|first = Leif|last = Edvinsson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firm size and industry type are the two controlled variables that are used in all three methods.

=== Output Method ===
The output method is measured by the total effort of managing the technology and operations which achieve business effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Total Quality Management and Business Excellence|last = Kueng|first = P|publisher = |year = 2000|isbn = |location = |pages = 67–85|chapter = “Process performance measurement system: a tool to support process-based organizations”|volume = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process indicators measure the actual value of labor productivity, such as profit per employee, to determine the contribution to the firm's overall productivity. This method is based on reviewing past performances to predict future results.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Management Capability ===
Management capability is the capability of constructing and coordinating resources to integrate and develop processes to respond to changing business conditions. The method measures the value of the process capital at the time of the measurement as a percentage change of the productivity compared to the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Dynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management|journal = Strategic Management Journal|date = 1997-08-01|pages = 509–533|volume = 18|issue = 7|first = David J.|last = Teece|first2 = Gary|last2 = Pisano|first3 = Amy|last3 = Shuen|doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-0266(199708)18:7&lt;509::aid-smj882&gt;3.0.co;2-z|jstor=3088148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Green Capital ==
Studies show that process capital has a positive influence on competitive advantages of firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Positive Effect of Green Intellectual Capital on Competitive Advantages of Firms|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-006-9349-1|journal = Journal of Business Ethics|date = 2007-03-17|issn = 0167-4544|pages = 271–286|volume = 77|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s10551-006-9349-1|first = Yu-Shan|last = Chen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Competitive Advantage ===
Companies engaging in environmental management and green innovation actively can not only minimise production waste and increase productivity, but also charge relatively high prices for green products, improve corporate images, and thereby obtain corporate competitive advantages under the trends of popular environmentalism consciousness of consumers and severe international regulations of environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Proactive Corporate Environmental Management: A New Industrial Revolution|journal = The Academy of Management Executive (1993-2005)|date = 1998-05-01|pages = 38–50|volume = 12|issue = 2|first = Michael A.|last = Berry|first2 = Dennis A.|last2 = Rondinelli|doi=10.5465/ame.1998.650515|jstor=4165456}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the stocks of organisational capabilities, organisational commitments, knowledge management systems, reward systems, information technology systems, databases, managerial institution, operation processes, managerial philosophies, organisational culture, company images, patents, copy rights, and trademarks, etc. about environmental protection or green innovation within a company can help companies obtain competitive advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Toward a New Conception of the Environment-Competitiveness Relationship|url = https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/jep.9.4.97|journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives|pages = 97–118|volume = 9|issue = 4|doi = 10.1257/jep.9.4.97|first = Michael E|last = Porter|first2 = Claas van der|last2 = Linde}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measuring Green Capital ===

''(8) whether the overall operation processes about environmental protection in the firm work smoothly;''

''(9) whether the knowledge management system about environmental management in the firm is favorable for the accumulation and sharing of the knowledge of environmental management.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Management Theory and Practice|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HQhvAnb4TgMC|publisher = Cengage Learning EMEA|date = 2004-01-01|isbn = 1844800881|first = Gerald A.|last = Cole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process Capital and Nursing ==
Process capital is one of the three components of [[structural capital]].  Nursing structural capital is knowledge converted into information structures that nurses can use to assist with their clinical decision-making and care planning.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The middle-range theory of nursing intellectual capital|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2648.2008.04626.x/abstract|journal = Journal of Advanced Nursing|date = 2008-07-01|issn = 1365-2648|pages = 94–103|volume = 63|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2008.04626.x|first = Christine L.|last = Covell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nursing structural capital in the form of practice guidelines, care maps or protocols is believed to provide relevant information to nurses for improving the quality of care they deliver. Care maps, practice guidelines and protocols have been found to contribute to improved patient outcomes and reduce the rate of adverse events.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Transforming Human Capital to Structural Capital ==

=== Distinguishing between Information Elements  ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Intellectual Capital Relations Chart.jpeg|thumb|337x337px|Figure 1]] --&gt;
The intellectual capital model distinguishes between three distinct elements: Human Capital, Structural Capital, and Relational Capital. Leadership represents ideas of Human Capital, the intellectual value of the employees in a firm. All intellectual capital first originates as Human Capital. Innovation and process capital represents components of structural capital, elements that show the legal and process value of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = 1st|title = Intellectual Capital: Core asset for the third millennium|url = https://www.amazon.com/Intellectual-Capital-asset-third-millennium/dp/1861524080|publisher = Cengage Learning|date = 1996-07-30|location = London|isbn = 9781861524089|first = Annie|last = Brooking|first2 = Brooking|last2 = a|first3 = Brooking|last3 = Annie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Innovation capital includes embodied knowledge sets like patents and copyrights. Process capital tends to consist of more intangible elements of a tacit knowledge set which includes process technologies. In other words, structural capital consists of  elements with which the firm's members interact to create more knowledge or get the work done. Relational capital is moderated by cultural capital and both of these elements represent the knowledge needed to provide ongoing value-added relations with shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Tacit knowledge the key to the strategic alignment of intellectual capitalnull|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/eb054547|journal = Planning Review|date = 1996-02-01|issn = 0094-064X|pages = 10–16|volume = 24|issue = 2|doi = 10.1108/eb054547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(Figure 1 source.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Leveraging intellectual capital through product and process management of human capital|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/14691930210448323|journal = Journal of Intellectual Capital|pages = 415–429|volume = 3|issue = 4|doi = 10.1108/14691930210448323|first = William H.A.|last = Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Key Principle ===
The key principle illustrated in Figure 1 is that no element of intellectual capital by itself creates ongoing value for the firm but is value creating only when interacting with other elements of the intellectual capital model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Organizational Behavior 2: Essential theories of process and structure|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qqZ_FDFoDcMC|publisher = M.E. Sharpe|date = 2006-01-01|isbn = 9780765615251|first = John B.|last = Miner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the true nature of the intellectual capital machine within the firm is dynamic and with reference to measurement issues. Measuring one elements may affect the measurement of another and once measurements are made of the element its magnitude and direction of flow may have already changed. Total knowledge of the intellectual capital system through measurement is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mapping Strategic Knowledge|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LE95fcRz_IcC|publisher = SAGE|date = 2002-01-31|isbn = 9781446232279|first = Anne Sigismund|last = Huff|first2 = Mark|last2 = Jenkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Institutionalisation Issues ===
A problem that may result from narrowly defining the knowledge stocks to be measured is that of reification and institutionalisation of such stock. Identifying a set of importance may over-emphasise the real strategic value of the set, especially in times of strategical change. When knowledge stocks are identified and attention given to them their importance may be rectified by those within the firm and results in the development of core rigidities, or strategic commitment, which may stagnate potentially revitalising innovation. Leonard-Barton identified knowledge as one of the most difficult to change. When it is past success and attention, it creates core rigidities. The term she uses to demonstrate the basic principle is a "way of seeing is also a way of not seeing." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Wellsprings of Knowledge" by Dorothy Leonard-Barton|url = http://www.strategy-business.com/article/8599?gko=8edb4|website = strategy+business|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structuralization assumption ==
The predominance of a structuralization assumption is that all knowledge needs to be structuralized to be valuable to a firm, leading to reification of knowledge as explicit. This assumption treats all knowledge as easily distinguishable from human experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Review|journal = Administrative Science Quarterly|date = 1959-06-01|pages = 129–131|volume = 4|issue = 1|doi = 10.2307/2390654|first = William H.|last = Form|jstor=2390654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lynn's anecdote ===
A woman who had been working in North America for a German company was fired when the firm downsized and moved all its operations back to Germany. Later, the company learned that the woman had been working on strategically important information on the North American market, thus the knowledge this woman had created had been erroneously "let go" in the process of downsizing.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Intellectual capital: perceptions of productivity a and investment|url = http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S1415-65552011000200006&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal = Revista de Administração Contemporânea|issn = 1415-6555|pages = 249–260|volume = 15|issue = 2|doi = 10.1590/S1415-65552011000200006|first = Aristides Isidoro|last = Ferreira|first2 = Luís Fructuoso|last2 = Martinez}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moral of the story espoused by the author was that the company should have structuralized this knowledge so that it could be owned and retained by the firm even after eliminating the woman from its payroll. Why was the woman fired? Surely, the firm should have been more aware of its developing knowledge sets because knowledge sets are the bases from which all intellectual capital emanates. Furthermore, the strategically relevant information is communicable and could have been codified.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Issues in managing multiple capital ===
How does the firm manage both its structural capital as product and its human capital as process? If this flip side seems humanistic, it is. The human intellect is the only entity that has the capacity to create new knowledge that has value. Computers may reassemble information into new modes analytically but cannot integrate these into something new. Structuralization of human capital may be only possible and desired when it can be used to further help the development of human capital, as non-contextual data or information, or sold as a product for profit. An important insight is that the firm need not own something outright in order for it to profit from association. An example of such an intangible tacit knowledge set that the firm could hardly structuralize and yet profits by association is seen in the relational capital created between a sales agent and client.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The move towards structuralization of tacit, experiential knowledge may result in other problems. Attempts to measure knowledge stock may disrupt the very process involved in creating new knowledge stocks. In such attempts, will we have killed the goose in order to get the golden egg? That is, the very process of measurement may interfere with the process by which knowledge creates value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Tacit Dimension|url = http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/T/bo6035368.html|website = University of Chicago Press|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, firms should also look towards leveraging intellectual capital through "organising" rather than "structuralizaing" their knowledge assets: organising attempts to coordinate the intellectual capital elements such that their interaction increases ongoing value of the firm as a  " going concern" rather than simply as an asset on a balance sheet.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Another problem here may be called the "false recipe" syndrome where the metaphor is that of the chef who, unconsciously or otherwise, neglects to communicate subtle but important elements of a recipe. Managers often lose the support of labor in initiating productivity improvement  exercise because, rightly or wrongly, they are perceived as designed to put workers out of a job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Commitment: Dynamic of Strategy|url = https://www.amazon.co.uk/Commitment-Dynamic-Strategy-Pankaj-Ghemawat/dp/0029115752|publisher = The Free Press|date = 1991-08-15|location = New York|isbn = 9780029115756|first = Pankaj|last = Ghemawat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product and process ==
In managing intellectual capital there are at least two distinct things that are being managed. Figure 2 illustrates these two streams flowing from the development of human capital.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; (Figure 2 source.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;)

=== Stock ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Process and product chart.jpeg|thumb|450x450px|Figure 2]] --&gt;
The first is the knowledge stock itself. The most successful examples of managing intellectual capital from the literature are indicative of this type. Because this type represents the structural capital of the "structuralization" assumption, this is not surprising. It is, however, important. Usually these consist of the products of the intellectual capital development process.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Work ===
The second thing being managed is the knowledge work itself. This is more difficult to manage than the first because of its intangible nature. Inevitably the knowledge worker will be the best equipped to understand the full requirements of any particular job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Intellectual Capital for Communities|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qtwJBAAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 2012-06-25|isbn = 9781136395000|first = Ahmed|last = Bounfour|first2 = Leif|last2 = Edvinsson}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, managers must act as facilitators, setting up the structures and process that will help the knowledge worker will be best equipped to understand the full requirements of any particular job. In this case, managers must act as facilitators, setting up the structures and processes that will help the knowledge worker's development and allow for the efficient interaction of human capital with the other elements of the intellectual capital framework.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5529">The project controller is a key member of the project team and works directly with the project manager to help define the project's goals and objectives; create and maintain a project's budget and schedule, analyse progress reported against the work schedules; and recommend actions to improve progress. In order to ensure accurate documentation and reporting on a consistent basis, many organisations are positioning the project manager and project controller as part of a centralised project support organisation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arabianbusiness.com/the-role-of-project-controller-10704.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Job==
Project controllers are often employed by consulting firms that perform management, [[technology]], and/or [[human capital]] work for an external client. Although titles vary from firm to firm, most large consulting firms such as [[Accenture]], [[PWC]], [[Deloitte]] and [[Bearing Point]] have individuals who perform project controller duties. The project controller is responsible for overseeing the financial health of the project by analyzing costs, revenue, risks, and pricing for the consulting firm. The role of the project controller can vary depending on the type and scale of the project, but most all project controllers maintain budget tracking tools, issue invoices and billings, manage fee structures, and forecast potential gains and losses in pursuing future work with a client.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanresources.hrvinet.com/project-controller-job-description Project Controller Key Duties] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918213920/http://www.humanresources.hrvinet.com/project-controller-job-description/ |date=2010-09-18 }} HR Management. November 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all projects have a project controller. Smaller projects that are expected to be shorter in duration typically may have no project controller overseeing the daily financial activity of the project. The responsibility will usually be assumed by the [[project manager]] of the project. For larger scale projects or projects requiring on-site interaction with the external client (typically [[public sector]] projects), there may be one or several project controllers to ensure that staffing levels and billing rates are appropriate for the budgetary scope of the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabianbusiness.com/the-role-of-project-controller-10704.html The Role of a Project Controller] Arabian Business. November 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Because most project controllers are serving the internal project management team, they are typically considered non-billable to the client. However, in projects where client staff and the consulting firm work in the same unit, some clients have agreed to be billed for project controllers to facilitate financial transactions and communications between the [[Consultant|consulting]] firm and the client. Some project controllers will also perform [[expense audits]] for the project to ensure that all expenses to the project are in compliance with the consulting firm's and the client's expense policies.

Along with profit/loss analysis and budgeting, project controllers are often involved in the original pricing of a project. The pricing of a project occurs before the work begins and is meant decide the best fee structure and overall cost to the client for the service that will be provided. The project controller helps determine the optimal price to charge the client in order to retain profit at the end of the engagement. 

==Qualification==
Although there are no formal qualification criteria, project controllers usually have graduate level training in project management or finance such as [[master of science in finance|MSF]] or [[MBA]] degrees, or are [[qualified accountant]]s (i.e. CIMA, CCA, ACCA, CGA, [[Certified Management Accountant|CMA]], or CA designation). "Industry experience" is often a pre-requisite and so controllers often have undergraduate degrees in related fields. Also, many analysts originally enter this domain through their practice as consultants or accountants and so a very wide range of qualifications is common.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usjobs.deloitte.com/jobs/306827-Consulting-Project-Controller-Project-Financial-Analyst.aspx Deloitte Project Controller Qualifications]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Deloitte November 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some firms, it is (additionally) preferred that analysts earn a professional certification such as the [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]] (CIMA) [[Chartered Financial Analyst]] (CFA) designation, or the [[Certified International Investment Analyst]] (CIIA) designation. However, professional designation is rarely a requirement, and many have reached the peak of the profession without ever sitting for the CFA or the CIIA exam. 

Basic [[analytical skills]], and strong numerical skills are necessary and a proficient understanding of and experience with [[Microsoft Excel]] is usually required.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6518">'''Rapid Results''' is a structured process that mobilizes teams to achieve tangible results over a rapid time frame and accelerate organizational learning. [http://www.schafferresults.com Schaffer Consulting], a [[management consulting]] firm headquartered in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], developed the Rapid Results approach based on their experience working with clients across industries to achieve breakthrough levels of performance. The approach and its practitioners have since been recognized in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', and ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', among other publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Tina|title=Making Change Happen, on a Deadline|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/making-change-happen-on-a-deadline/|newspaper=The New York Times|date=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schaffer|first1=Robert|title=Demand Better Results - And Get Them|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=1 March 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foreign Policy"&gt;{{cite web|title=The FP Top 100 Global Thinkers 2012|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/11/26/the_fp_100_global_thinkers?page=0,24#thinker25|publisher=Foreign Policy Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Schaffer Consulting founded the [[Rapid Results Institute]] (RRI) to refine the methodology to support non-profit work and development projects across Sub-Saharan Africa, South America, the United States, and the Middle East.

== Methodology ==

The objective of Rapid Results initiatives is to achieve dramatic results, formed under the pressure of short time frames and ambitious targets.&lt;ref name="Global Health 101"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skolnik|first=Richard|title=Global Health 101|year=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|location=Burlington, MA|isbn=0763797510|pages=174–175|url=https://books.google.com.lb/books?id=sBQRpj4uWmYC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;lpg=PA174&amp;dq=(Rapid+Results+Institute+and+Micronutrient+Initiative+2008&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VVnQliS5--&amp;sig=BETcx2RH6JJeZYfP53x_EG6_1Ag&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4-QkUfiZMIm70QXqp4CgDw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=rapid%20results%20institute&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid Results initiatives begin with a call to action for significant performance improvement delivered by a single leader or group of leaders to cross-functional teams of 8-10 people. Team members then set and commit to "seemingly unreasonable" short-term goals — often in 100 days or less — tied to the strategic imperatives outlined by their leaders. Teams then experiment with new ways of working, capturing learnings along the way, and persisting until they achieve desired outcomes. Rapid Results aims to stimulate innovation, collaboration, and more effective execution in and across organizations and stakeholder groups. Leaders leverage initial results to create longer-term and wider-scale impact in subsequent waves of Rapid Results projects.&lt;ref name="Managing Human Resources"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jackson|author2=Ones|author3=Dilchert|title=Managing Human Resources for Environmental Sustainability|year=2012|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=319–340|url=https://books.google.com.lb/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=UBBeYc1rCu0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA319&amp;dq=%22Rapid+Results+Institute%22&amp;ots=pQjY2tyTeS&amp;sig=W1Pq8GqOGTk3ntqQjeKeF8H7H2c&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Rapid%20Results%20Institute%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business impact ==

Leaders in many industries leverage Rapid Results to achieve performance goals, including accelerating growth, increasing productivity, and realizing cost savings.

Lynn Chambers, group head of Talent at the London Stock Exchange Group, says, “This approach can be taken to accelerate progress on almost any goal.” Dean Scarborough, president and chief executive officer of Avery Dennison describes Rapid Results “driving an incredible amount of creativity” among team members. Martha Marsh, former president and CEO of Stanford Hospital and Clinics, observes that Rapid Results “provide an intense focus on getting results, while helping build the capacity of our organization to drive transformational change.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schaffer|first1=Robert|last2=Ashkenas|first2=Ron|title=Rapid Results! How 100-Day Projects Build the Capacity for Large-Scale Change|date=2005|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rapid Results Institute ==

Formed in 2007, the Rapid Results Institute works with a broad range of partners — including government agencies, not-for-profit organizations, and international development agencies — across a wide spectrum of development initiatives. Past and ongoing projects include H.I.V. prevention in [[Eritrea]] and [[Ethiopia]], public sector reform in [[Kenya]], waste management in [[Brazil]], and housing [[homeless veterans in the United States]].

The Rapid Results Institute is partnering with the 100,000 Homes Campaign and the [[US Department of Veterans Affairs]] to house homeless veterans across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Tina|title=Teaming Up to End Homelessness|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/whe-one-fix-leads-to-another/|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development impact ==

Following a project on [[HIV/AIDS]] awareness among youth, Eritrean Minister of Education Osman Saleh called the Rapid Results approach "a new movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Valerio|first1=Alexandria|title=Education and HIV/AIDS: A Sourcebook of HIV/AIDS Prevention Programs|date=2008|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780821374405|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kenya]], an independent evaluation by the AIDS Research and Treatment journal reported that “significant improvement in PMTCT [prevention of mother-to-child-transmission] services can be achieved through introduction of an RRI [Rapid Results Initiative], which appears to lead to sustained benefits for pregnant HIV-infected women and their infants.”

Due to its success in a variety of contexts, the Rapid Results approach has been adopted by the [[World Bank]], as well as by many Kenyan government ministries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The FP Top 100 Global Thinkers 2012|journal=Foreign Policy Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16173">'''Shared services''' is the provision of a service by one part of an organization or group, where that service had previously been found, in more than one part of the organization or group. Thus the funding and resourcing of the service is shared and the providing department effectively becomes an internal service provider. The key here is the idea of 'sharing' within an organization or group. This sharing needs to fundamentally include shared accountability of results by the unit from where the work is migrated to the provider. The provider, on the other hand, needs to ensure that the agreed results are delivered based on defined measures ([[Performance indicator|KPI]]s, cost, quality etc.).

== Overviews ==
Shared services is similar to collaboration that might take place between different organizations such as a Hospital Trust or a Police Force. For example, adjacent Trusts might decide to collaborate by merging their HR or IT functions.

There are two arguments for sharing services:&lt;ref name="thesystemsthinkingreview18"&gt;[http://www.thesystemsthinkingreview.co.uk/index.php?pg=18&amp;utwkstoryid=266 Why do we believe in economy of scale?]. Thesystemsthinkingreview.co.uk. Retrieved on 2013-07-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The ‘less of a common resource' argument and the ‘efficiency through industrialization' argument. The former is ‘obvious': if you have fewer managers, IT systems, buildings etc; if you use less of some resource, it will reduce costs. The second argument is ‘efficiency through industrialization’. This argument assumes that efficiencies follow from specialization and standardization – resulting in the creation of ‘front' and ‘back' offices. The typical method is to simplify, standardize and then centralize, using an IT 'solution' as the means.

Shared services is different from the model of [[outsourcing]], which is where an external third party is paid to provide a service that was previously internal to the buying organization, typically leading to redundancies and re-organization. There is an ongoing debate about the advantages of shared services over [[outsourcing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/05/30/78681_23OPreality_1.html Outsourcing vs. shared services | InfoWorld | Column | 2006-05-30 | By Ephraim Schwartz&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115115454/http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/05/30/78681_23OPreality_1.html |date=2008-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itbusinessedge.com/item/?ci=18405 Shared Services vs. Outsourcing | IT Business Edge&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029160946/http://www.itbusinessedge.com/item/?ci=18405 |date=2006-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.us.capgemini.com/news/current_news.asp?ID=441&amp;PRyear=2004 Capgemini U.S. | Jury Is Still Out On Outsourcing Versus Shared Services As Dominant Service Delivery Model, Says Capgemini Survey&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | citeseerx = 10.1.1.109.6832 | last1 = Janssen | first1 = M. | last2 = Joha | first2 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Motives for Establishing Shared Service Centers in Public Administrations | journal = International Journal of Information Management | issn = 0268-4012 | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 102–116 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes assumed that a [[joint venture]] between a government department and a commercial organization is an example of shared services. The joint venture involves the creation of a separate legal commercial entity (jointly owned), which provides profit to its shareholders.

Traditionally the development of a shared-service organization (SSO) or shared-service centre (SSC) within an organization is an attempt to reduce costs (often attempted through [[economies of scale]]), standardized processes (through centralization). A global Service Center Benchmark study&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssonetwork.com/business-process-outsourcing/webinars/the-hackett-group-and-sson-service-center-benchmar/#.UdGPftfF8ms SSON and Hackett Group global Service Center Benchmark study | Shared Services &amp; Outsourcing Network (SSON) | Webinar | 2009-03-31 | Presented by Penny Weller]&lt;/ref&gt; carried out by the Shared Services &amp; Outsourcing Network (SSON) and the Hackett Group, which surveyed more than 250 companies, found that only about a third of all participants were able to generate cost savings of 20% or greater from their SSOs. At NASA, the 2006 switch to a shared services model is realizing nearly $20 million of savings annually. Further, by the end of 2015, the NASA Shared Services Center is expected to save the organization a total of over $200 million, according to NASA’s Director of Service Delivery.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Newton, “Shared Services: Bringing Efficiency from NASA to Higher Education,” The EvoLLLution, October 17, 2014. Accessed at http://www.evolllution.com/opinions/shared-services-bringing-efficiency-nasa-higher-education/&lt;/ref&gt;

A large-scale cultural and process transformation can be a key component of a move to shared services and may include redundancies and changes of work practices. It is claimed that transformation often results in a better quality of work life for employees although there are few case studies to back this up {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}.

Shared services are more than just centralization or consolidation of similar activities in one location. Shared services can mean running these service activities like a business and delivering services to internal customers at a cost, quality, and timeliness that is competitive with alternatives.

== Critics of shared services ==

The management thinker and inventor of [[The Vanguard Method]], Professor [[John Seddon]] claims that shared service projects based on attempts to achieve '[[economies of scale]]' are a mix of the plausibly obvious and a little hard data, brought together to produce two broad assertions, for which there is little hard factual evidence.&lt;ref name="thesystemsthinkingreview18"/&gt; He argues that shared service projects fail (and often end up costing more than they hoped to save) because they cause a disruption to the service flow by moving the work to a central location, creating waste in handoffs, rework and duplication, lengthening the time it takes to deliver a service and consequently creating [[failure demand]] (demand caused by a failure to do something or do something right for a customer).&lt;ref&gt;Systems Thinking in the Public Sector, John Seddon, Page 57&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial structures ==

A shared service can take a variety of different commercial structures. The basic commercial structures include:

; Unitary: A single organization consolidating and centralizing a business service
: Lead department: An organization consolidating and centralizing a business service that will be shared by other organizations
; Joint initiatives: Agreement between two or more organizations to set up and operate shared services

== Location variations ==

It is sometimes argued that there are three basic location variations for a shared service including:

; On-shore: Work is carried out in the same country but at a different location
; [[Nearshoring|Near-shore]]: Work is carried out in a close location (e.g. continental Europe relative to the UK)
; [[Offshoring|Off-shore]]: Work is carried out anywhere in the world that is not on-shore or near-shore

This is not just to take advantage of wage arbitrage but to appreciate the talents of particular economies in delivering specific service offerings.

The difficulty with this argument is that near-shore and off-shore are normally associated with the [[outsourcing]] model and are difficult to reconcile with the notion of an internally shared service as distinct from an externally purchased service. Clearly, the use of off-shore facilities by a government department is not an example of shared services.

== Benchmarking and measurement ==

In establishing and running a shared service, [[benchmarking]] and [[measurement]] is considered by some as a necessity. Benchmarking is the comparison of the service provision usually against [[best in class]]. The measurement occurs by using agreed key performance indicators (KPIs). Although the amount of KPIs chosen differs greatly it is generally accepted that fewer than 10 carefully chosen KPIs will deliver the best results.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Organizations do attempt to define benchmarks for processes and business operations.

Benchmarking can be used to achieve different goals including:&lt;br&gt;
'''1.''' To drive performance improvements using benchmarks as a means for setting performance targets that are met either through incremental performance improvements or transformational change.&lt;br&gt;
-	Strategic: with a focus on a long term horizon; and &lt;br&gt;
-	Tactical: with a focus on the short and medium term

'''2.''' To focus an organization on becoming world class with processes that deliver the highest levels of performance that are better than those of its peer group.

== In the private sector ==

The [[private sector]] has been moving towards shared services since the beginning of the 1980s. Large organizations such as the [[BBC]], [[BP]], [[Bristol Myers Squibb]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[GE]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Pfizer]], [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]], [[ArcelorMittal]], and [[SAP AG|SAP]] are operating them with great success. According to the English Institute of Chartered Accountants, more than 30% of U.S. Fortune 500 companies have implemented a shared-service center, and are reporting cost savings in their general accounting functions of up to 46%.

The conventional accounting practice used to generate these figures is disputed however by management thinker Professor [[John Seddon]], who argues that the measurement known as 'unit cost' tells you nothing about overall costs. Overall costs include '[[failure demand]]', which is defined as a failure to do something or do something right for the customer.

== In the public sector ==
The public sector has taken note of the benefits derived in the private sector and continues to strive for best practice. The United States and Australia among others have had shared services in government since the late 1990s. However, the failures of these projects are increasingly being reported by the press&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cio.com.au/article/392372/government_shared_services_navigate_rocky_road_-_part_1 Government shared services navigate a rocky road - Part 1 - shared services, government services division, queensland health].

=== UK ===
The UK government under a central drive to efficiency following from the [[Gershon Review]] are working to an overall plan for realizing the benefits of shared services. The [[Cabinet Office]] has established a team specifically tasked with the role of accelerating the take up and developing the strategy for all government departments to converge and consolidate. The savings potential of this transformation in the UK Public Sector was initially estimated by the [[Cabinet Office]] at £1.4bn per annum (20%  of the estimated cost of HR and Finance functions). The [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)]] in its November 2007 report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/nao_reports/07-08/07089.pdf NAO report (HC 2007-08): improving corporate functions using shared services&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that this £1.4bn figure lacked a clear baseline of costs and contained several uncertainties, such as the initial expenditure required and the time frame for the savings.

There are reports of UK government shared service centres failing to realise savings, such as the Department of Transport's project, described as 'stupendous incompetence' by the Parliament's Public Accounts Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/systems-management/2008/12/16/mps-condemn-dft-shared-services-failure-39578367/ ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS), has implemented shared services for a number of departments and functions. For example, IT Assist (the ICT Shared Service Centre) provides common infrastructure and desktop services to NICS staff in the office, at home or when mobile working.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sogeti.ie/en/News--Events/Events/New-Webinar-Series--Software-Test-Leadership-/New-Webinar-Series-Business-Transformation/Public-Sector-Shared-Services/ Case study presentation on the IT Assist programme in Northern Ireland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511160218/http://www.sogeti.ie/en/News--Events/Events/New-Webinar-Series--Software-Test-Leadership-/New-Webinar-Series-Business-Transformation/Public-Sector-Shared-Services/ |date=2010-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===

The government of Canada instituted Shared Services Canada on August 4, 2011, with the objective of consolidating its data centres, networks and email systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.gc.ca/web/article-eng.do?nid=614499 Canada News Centre - Government of Canada to Reduce Information Technology Costs and Save Taxpayers' Dollars] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111170030/http://news.gc.ca/web/article-eng.do?nid=614499 |date=January 11, 2012 }}. News.gc.ca (2011-08-04). Retrieved on 2013-07-26.&lt;/ref&gt; This follows a tendency to centralize IT services that has been followed by the provinces of British Columbia, Québec, and Ontario, as well as the federal government of the United States of America and some states like Texas. PriceWaterhouseCoopers recommended integrating government data centres in a report ordered by Public Works and Government Services Canada, revealed in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/comm/vedette-features/2011-12-02-00-eng.html PricewaterhouseCoopers feasibility study provides valuable insight into Government of Canada Data Centre Environment - Features - PWGSC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305035654/http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/comm/vedette-features/2011-12-02-00-eng.html |date=2012-03-05 }}.

=== Ireland ===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the health service nationally has been reorganized from a set of regional Health Boards to a unified national structure, the Health Services Executive. Within this structure there will be a National Shared Services Organisation, based on the model developed at the former Eastern Health Shared Services, where procurement, HR, finance and ICT services were provided to health agencies in the Eastern Region of Ireland on a business-to business basis.

==New trends==

Organizations that have centralized their IT functions have now begun to take a close look at the technology services that their IT departments provide to internal customers, evaluating where it makes sense to provide specific technology components as a shared service.  E-mail and scanning operations were obvious early candidates; many organizations with document-intensive operations are deploying scanning centers as a shared service.

Many large organizations, in both the public and private sectors, are now considering deploying [[Enterprise Content Management|enterprise content management (ECM)]] technology as a shared service.

===Synthetic fibres===
[[Artificial fibres]] can be made by extruding a polymer, through a spinneret into a medium where it hardens. Wet spinning (rayon) uses a coagulating medium. In dry spinning (acetate and triacetate), the polymer is contained in a solvent that evaporates in the heated exit chamber. In melt spinning (nylons and polyesters) the extruded polymer is cooled in gas or air and then sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these fibres will be of great length, often kilometres long.

Artificial fibres can be processed as long fibres or batched and cut so they can be processed like a natural fibre.

===Natural fibres===
[[Natural fibres]] are either from animals ([[wool|sheep]], [[goat]], [[Angora rabbit|rabbit]], [[silk|silk-worm]]) mineral ([[asbestos]]) or from plants ([[cotton]], [[flax]], [[sisal]]). These vegetable fibres can come from the seed (cotton), the stem (known as bast fibres: flax, [[hemp]], [[jute]]) or the leaf (sisal).&lt;ref name="Collier 1970 5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without exception, many processes are needed before a clean even staple is obtained- each with a specific name. With the exception of silk, each of these fibres is short, being only centimeters in length, and each has a rough surface that enables it to bond with similar staples.&lt;ref name="Collier 1970 5"/&gt;

==History==

===Cottage stage===
{{Main|Textile manufacturing by pre-industrial methods}} There are some indications that weaving was already known in the [[Palaeolithic]]. An indistinct [[textile]] impression has been found at [[Pavlovian culture|Pavlov]], Moravia.  [[Neolithic]] textiles were found in [[pile dwellings]] excavations in Switzerland and at [[Fayum|El Fayum, Egypt]] at a site which dates to about [[5th millennium BC|5000 BC]].

In Roman times, wool, linen and leather clothed the European population, and silk, imported along the [[Silk Road]] from China, was an extravagant luxury. The use of [[flax]] fiber in the manufacturing of cloth in Northern Europe dates back to Neolithic times.

During the late [[medieval]] period, [[cotton]] began to be [[International trade|import]]ed into Northern [[Europe]].  Without any knowledge of what it came from, other than that it was a [[plant]], noting its similarities to wool, people in the region could only imagine that cotton must be produced by plant-borne sheep. [[John Mandeville]], writing in 1350, stated as fact the now-preposterous belief: "There grew in [[Indian subcontinent|India]] a wonderful tree which bore tiny lambs on the edges of its branches. These branches were so pliable that they bent down to allow the lambs to feed when they are hungry." This aspect is retained in the name for cotton in many European languages, such as [[German language|German]] ''Baumwolle'', which translates as "tree wool". By the end of the 16th century, cotton was cultivated throughout the warmer regions of Asia and the Americas.

The main steps in the production of cloth are producing the fibre, preparing it, converting it to yarn, converting yarn to cloth, and then finishing the cloth. The cloth is then taken to the manufacturer of garments. The preparation of the fibres differs the most, depending on the fibre used. Flax requires [[retting]] and dressing, while wool requires carding and washing. The [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] and [[weaving]] processes are very similar between fibers, however.

Spinning evolved from twisting the fibers by hand, to using a [[Spindle (textiles)|drop spindle]], to using a [[spinning wheel]]. Spindles or parts of them have been found in archaeological sites and may represent one of the first pieces of technology available. They were invented in the [[Indian subcontinent]] between 500 and 1000 AD.&lt;ref name=Wayne&gt;Cotton: Origin, History, Technology, and Production By C. Wayne Smith, Joe Tom Cotton.  Page viii.

===Britain===
{{Main|Calico Acts|Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution}}

The key British industry at the beginning of the 18th century was the production of textiles made with wool from the large sheep-farming areas in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and across the country (created as a result of land-clearance and [[enclosure]]). This was a labour-intensive activity providing employment throughout Britain, with major centres being the West Country; [[Norwich]] and environs; and the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]].  The export trade in woolen goods accounted for more than a quarter of British exports during most of the 18th century, doubling between 1701 and 1770.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/toynbee/indrev|title=Lectures On The Industrial Revolution In England: Public Addresses, Notes and Other Fragments, together with a Short Memoir by B.

Exports by the cotton industry &amp;ndash; centered in [[Lancashire]] &amp;ndash; had grown tenfold during this time, but still accounted for only a tenth of the value of the woolen trade. Before the 17th century, the manufacture of goods was performed on a limited scale by individual workers, usually on their own premises (such as [[weavers' cottage]]s). Goods were transported around the country by [[cloth merchant|clothiers]] who visited the village with their trains of [[packhorse]]s. Some of the cloth was made into clothes for people living in the same area, and a large amount of cloth was exported.  [[River navigation]]s were constructed, and some contour-following [[canal]]s. In the early 18th century, artisans were inventing ways to become more productive. [[Silk]], wool, [[fustian]], and [[linen]] were being eclipsed by cotton, which was becoming the most important textile. This set the foundations for the changes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/IndustrialRevolutionandtheStandardofLiving.html Industrial Revolution and the Standard of Living: The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221233322/http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/IndustrialRevolutionandtheStandardofLiving.html |date=2008-02-21 }}, Library of Economics and Liberty&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial revolution===
{{Main|Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution}}

The woven fabric portion of the textile industry grew out of the [[industrial revolution]] in the 18th century as [[mass production]] of yarn and cloth became a mainstream industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hammond|first=J.L.|last2=Hammond|authorlink1= John Lawrence Hammond|first2=Barbara|authorlink2 = Barbara Hammond|title=The Skilled Labourer 1760-1832| url=https://archive.org/details/skilledlabourer00hammiala|format=pdf|publisher=Longmans, Green and co.|year=1919|location=London|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1734 in [[Bury, Lancashire]] [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]] invented the [[flying shuttle]] &amp;mdash; one of the first of a series of inventions associated with the cotton [[woven fabric]] industry.  The flying shuttle increased the width of cotton cloth and speed of production of a single weaver at a [[loom]].&lt;ref name=WF11&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Resistance by workers to the perceived threat to jobs delayed the widespread introduction of this technology, even though the higher rate of production generated an increased demand for [[spinning (textiles)|spun]] cotton. [[File:Bradford Industrial Museum 014.jpg|thumb|Shuttles]]

In 1761, the [[Bridgewater Canal|Duke of Bridgewater's canal]] connected Manchester to the coal fields of [[Worsley]] and in 1762, [[Matthew Boulton]] opened the [[Soho Foundry]] engineering works in [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth]], [[Birmingham]].  His partnership with Scottish engineer [[James Watt]] resulted, in 1775, in the commercial production of the more efficient [[Watt steam engine]] which used a separate condenser.

In 1764, [[James Hargreaves]] is credited as inventor of the [[spinning jenny]] which multiplied the spun thread production capacity of a single worker &amp;mdash; initially eightfold and subsequently much further.  Others&lt;ref&gt;Great Industries of Great Britain, Volume I, published by Cassell Petter and Galpin, (London, Paris, New York, c1880).&lt;/ref&gt; credit the invention to [[Thomas Highs]].  [[Industrial unrest]] and a failure to patent the invention until 1770 forced Hargreaves from Blackburn, but his lack of protection of the idea allowed the concept to be exploited by others. As a result, there were over 20,000 spinning jennies in use by the time of his death. Also in 1764, Thorp Mill, the first water-powered [[cotton mill]] in the world was constructed at [[Royton]], Lancashire, and was used for carding cotton. With the spinning and weaving process now mechanized, cotton mills cropped up all over the North West of England.

The [[stocking frame]] invented in 1589 for silk became viable when in 1759, [[Jedediah Strutt]] introduced an attachment for the frame which produced what became known as the [[Derby Rib]],{{sfn|Earnshaw|1986|p=17}} that produced a knit and purl stitch. This allowed stockings to be manufactured in silk and later in cotton. In 1768, Hammond modified the stocking frame to weave weft-knitted openworks or nets by crossing over the loops, using a mobile tickler bar- this led in 1781 to Thomas Frost's square net. Cotton had been too coarse for [[lace]], but by 1805 Houldsworths of Manchester were producing reliable 300 count cotton thread.{{sfn|Earnshaw|1986|pp=24-26}}

===19th century developments===
{{for|further details of the operation and history of looms|Power loom}}
{{for|further details of the operation and history of spinning mules|Spinning mule}}
With the  Cartwright Loom, the Spinning Mule and the Boulton &amp; Watt steam engine, the pieces were in place to build a mechanised woven fabric textile industry. From this point there were no new inventions, but a continuous improvement in technology as the mill-owner strove to reduce cost and improve quality. Developments in the transport infrastructure; that is the canals and after 1831 the railways facilitated the import of raw materials and export of finished cloth.

Firstly, the use of water power to drive mills was supplemented by steam driven water pumps, and then superseded completely by the [[Stationary steam engine|steam engines]]. For example, [[Samuel Greg]] joined his uncle's firm of textile merchants, and, on taking over the company in 1782, he sought out a site to establish a mill.[[Quarry Bank Mill]] was built on the [[River Bollin]] at [[Styal]] in [[Cheshire]]. It was initially powered by a [[water wheel]], but installed steam engines  in 1810. [[Quarry Bank Mill]] in [[Cheshire]] still exists as a well-preserved museum, having been in use from its construction in 1784 until 1959.  It also illustrates how the mill owners exploited child labour, taking orphans from nearby [[Manchester]] to work the cotton. It shows that these children were housed, clothed, fed and provided with some education.  In 1830, the average power of a mill engine was 48&amp;nbsp;hp, but Quarry Bank mill installed a new 100&amp;nbsp;hp water wheel.&lt;ref name="Hills 1993 113"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hills|1993|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;  William Fairbairn addressed the problem of line-shafting  and was  responsible for improving the efficiency of the mill. In 1815 he replaced the wooden turning shafts that drove the machines at 50rpm, to wrought iron shafting working at 250 rpm, these were a third of the weight of the previous ones and absorbed less power.&lt;ref name="Hills 1993 113"/&gt;

[[File:Powerloom weaving in 1835.jpg|thumb|A Roberts loom in a weaving shed in 1835. Note the wrought iron shafting, fixed to the cast iron columns]]
Secondly, in 1830, using an 1822 patent, [[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Richard Roberts]] manufactured the first loom with a [[cast iron]] frame, the [[Roberts Loom]].&lt;ref name=WF11/&gt; In 1842 [[Howard &amp; Bullough|James Bullough and William Kenworthy]], made the [[Lancashire Loom]], a semiautomatic [[power loom]]: although it is self-acting, it has to be stopped to recharge empty shuttles. It was the mainstay of the [[Lancashire]] cotton industry for a century, until the [[Northrop Loom]] (invented in 1894, with an automatic weft replenishment function) gained ascendancy.

[[File:Baines 1835-Roberts' Self Acting Mule.png|thumb|Roberts self-acting mule with quadrant gearing]]
Thirdly, also in 1830, Richard Roberts patented the first self-acting mule. Stalybridge mule spinners strike was in 1824; this stimulated research into the problem of applying power to the winding stroke of the mule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hills|1993|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The draw while spinning had been assisted by power, but the push of the wind had been done manually by the spinner, the mule could be operated by semiskilled labor. Before 1830, the spinner would operate a partially powered mule with a maximum of 400 spindles; after, self-acting mules with up to 1300 spindles could be built.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|Farnie|1992|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Textile production in England peaked in 1926, and as mills were decommissioned, many of the scrapped mules and looms were bought up and reinstated in India.

===20th century===
{{See also|Clothing industry}}
[[File:Ignacy Płażewski, Prządki przy pracy, I-4717-4.jpg|thumb|Textile factory workers in Poland, 1950s]]

Major changes came to the textile industry during the 20th century, with continuing technological innovations in machinery, synthetic fibre, logistics, and globalization of the business. The business model that had dominated the industry for centuries was to change radically. Cotton and wool producers were not the only source for fibres, as chemical companies created new synthetic fibres that had superior qualities for many uses, such as [[rayon]], invented in 1910, and [[DuPont]]'s [[nylon]], invented in 1935 as in inexpensive silk substitute, and used for products ranging from women's stockings to tooth brushes and military parachutes.

The variety of synthetic fibres used in manufacturing fibre grew steadily throughout the 20th century. In the 1920s, [[the computer]] was invented; in the 1940s, [[acetate]], [[modacrylic]], metal fibres, and [[saran (plastic)|saran]] were developed; [[acrylic fiber|acrylic]], [[polyester]], and [[spandex]] were introduced in the 1950s. Polyester became hugely popular in the apparel market, and by the late 1970s, more polyester was sold in the United States than cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The U.S. textile and apparel industry : a revolution in progress : special report.|year=1987|publisher=United States Congress, Office of Technology Assessment|isbn=9781428922945|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1980s, the apparel segment was no longer the largest market for fibre products, with industrial and home furnishings together representing a larger proportion of the fibre market.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|title=The U.S. textile and apparel industry : a revolution in progress : special report.|year=1987|publisher=United States Congress, Office of Technology Assessment|isbn=9781428922945|pages=31–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Industry integration and global manufacturing led to many small firms closing for good during the 1970s and 1980s in the United States; during those decades, 95 percent of the looms in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia shut down, and Alabama and Virginia also saw many factories close.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Commerce and regulation==
The [[Multi Fibre Arrangement]] (MFA) governed the world trade in [[textiles]] and garments from 1974 through 2004, imposing [[wiktionary:quota|quota]]s on the amount [[developing country|developing countries]] could [[export]] to [[developed country|developed countries]]. It expired on 1 January 2005.

The MFA was introduced in 1974 as a short-term measure intended to allow developed countries to adjust to imports from the developing world. Developing countries have a natural advantage in textile production because it is labor-intensive and they have low labor costs. According to a [[World Bank]]/[[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) study, the system has cost the developing world 27 million jobs and $40 billion a year in lost exports.&lt;ref&gt;Presentation by H.E. K.M. Chandrasekhar, Chairman [[ITCB]], EC Conference on the Future of Textiles and Clothing after 2004, Brussels, 5 – 6 May 2003. {{cite web |url=http://www.itcb.org/Documents/ITCB-MI35.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221050047/http://www.itcb.org/Documents/ITCB-MI35.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Arrangement was not negative for all developing countries. For example, the [[European Union]] (EU) imposed no restrictions or duties on imports from the very poor countries, such as [[Bangladesh]], leading to a massive expansion of the industry there.

At the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) [[Uruguay Round]], it was decided to bring the textile trade under the jurisdiction of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). The WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing provided for the gradual dismantling of the quotas that existed under the MFA. This process was completed on 1 January 2005. However, large tariffs remain in place on many textile products.
[[File:Photo by Mona Mijthab, July 2011 (6349812257).jpg|thumb|Women work in a textile factory outside Dhaka, Bangladesh.]]
Bangladesh was expected to suffer the most from the ending of the MFA, as it was expected to face more competition, particularly from [[China]]. However, this was not the case. It turns out that even in the face of other economic giants, Bangladesh’s labor is “cheaper than anywhere else in the world.” While some smaller factories were documented making pay cuts and layoffs, most downsizing was essentially speculative – the orders for goods kept coming even after the MFA expired. In fact, Bangladesh's exports increased in value by about $500 million in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Haider, Mahtab. “Defying predictions, Bangladesh’s garment factories thrive.” The Christian Science Monitor. 7 Feb 2006. 11 Feb 2007. {{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0207/p04s02-wosc.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930084350/http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0207/p04s02-wosc.html |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory standards==
For textiles, like for many other products, there are certain national and international standards and regulations that need to be complied with to ensure quality, safety and sustainability.

The following standards amongst others apply to textiles:

* [[CPSIA]], e.g. Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/BUSINFO/frnotices/fr09/stflclcor.pdf|title=Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles|author=|date=|website=cpsc.gov|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108105745/https://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/frnotices/fr09/stflclcor.pdf|archivedate=8 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''trade sale''' is a common means of exit to a [[trade]] buyer. This allows the management to withdraw from the business and may open up the prospect of collaboration on larger projects. The term trade sale is mostly used in the context of venture capital funded businesses and refers to the sale of a company in its early stages. 

It normally entails the disposal of a company's [[shares]] or [[assets]] and even liabilities, in whole or in part. This may refer to a strategic buyer who intends to grow theirs business or to a financial buyer who wants to generate a financial return on their invested capital at the time of exit. 

Trade sales are the most frequently used to exit vehicle both in Europe and the US.

The term trade sale may also refer to [[business-to-business]] sales, rather than sales made directly to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=trade-sale|title=Trade Sale Definition from Financial Times Lexicon|website=lexicon.ft.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15218">'''Unstructured data''' (or '''unstructured information''') is information that either does not have a pre-defined [[data model]] or is not organized in a pre-defined manner. Unstructured information is typically [[plain text|text]]-heavy, but may contain data such as dates, numbers, and facts as well. This results in irregularities and [[ambiguities]] that make it difficult to understand using traditional programs as compared to data stored in fielded form in databases or [[annotation|annotated]] ([[Tag (metadata)|semantically tagged]]) in documents.

In 1998, [[Merrill Lynch]] cited a rule of thumb that somewhere around 80-90% of all potentially usable business information may originate in unstructured form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shilakes |first1=Christopher C. |last2=Tylman |first2=Julie |title=Enterprise Information Portals |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724175845/http://ikt.hia.no/perep/eip_ind.pdf |website=Merrill Lynch |date=16 Nov 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rule of thumb is not based on primary or any quantitative research, but nonetheless is accepted by some.&lt;ref name="Clarabridge"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Grimes |first1=Seth |title=Unstructured Data and the 80 Percent Rule |url=http://breakthroughanalysis.com/2008/08/01/unstructured-data-and-the-80-percent-rule |website=Breakthrough Analysis - Bridgepoints |publisher=Clarabridge |date=1 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources have reported similar or higher percentages of unstructured data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gandomi|first=Amir|last2=Haider|first2=Murtaza|date=April 2015|title=Beyond the hype: Big data concepts, methods, and analytics|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2014.10.007|journal=International Journal of Information Management|volume=35|issue=2|pages=137–144|doi=10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2014.10.007|issn=0268-4012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson/2016/05/biggest-data-challenges-might-not-even-know/|title=The biggest data challenges that you might not even know you have - Watson|date=2016-05-25|work=Watson|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.datamation.com/big-data/structured-vs-unstructured-data.html|title=Structured vs. Unstructured Data|website=www.datamation.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The earliest research into [[business intelligence]] focused in on unstructured textual data, rather than numerical data.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grimes|first1=Seth|title=A Brief History of Text Analytics|url=http://www.b-eye-network.com/view/6311|website=B Eye Network|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1958, [[computer science]] researchers like [[Hans Peter Luhn|H.P. Luhn]] were particularly concerned with the extraction and classification of unstructured text.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; However, only since the turn of the century has the technology caught up with the research interest. In 2004, the [[SAS (software)|SAS]] Institute developed the SAS Text Miner, which uses [[Singular Value Decomposition]] (SVD) to reduce a [[Dimensional Analysis|hyper-dimensional]] textual [[space (mathematics)|space]] into smaller dimensions for significantly more efficient machine-analysis.&lt;ref name="SVD"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Albright|first1=Russ|title=Taming Text with the SVD|url=ftp://ftp.sas.com/techsup/download/EMiner/TamingTextwiththeSVD.pdf|website=SAS|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematical and technological advances sparked by [[machine learning|machine]] textual analysis prompted a number of businesses to research applications, leading to the development of fields like [[sentiment analysis]], [[voice of the customer]] mining, and call center optimization.&lt;ref name="Applications"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Desai|first1=Manish|title=Applications of Text Analytics|url=http://mybusinessanalytics.blogspot.com/2009/08/applications-of-text-analytics.html|website=My Business Analytics @ Blogspot|accessdate=June 24, 2016|date=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of [[Big Data]] in the late 2000s led to a heightened interest in the applications of unstructured data analytics in contemporary fields such as [[predictive analytics]] and [[root cause analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chakraborty|first1=Goutam|title=Analysis of Unstructured Data: Applications of Text Analytics and Sentiment Mining|url=https://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings14/1288-2014.pdf|website=SAS|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues with terminology ==
The term is imprecise for several reasons:
# [[Structure]], while not formally defined, can still be implied.
# Data with some form of structure may still be characterized as unstructured if its structure is not helpful for the processing task at hand.
# Unstructured information might have some structure ([[semi-structured data|semi-structured]]) or even be highly structured but in ways that are unanticipated or unannounced.

== Dealing with unstructured data ==
Techniques such as [[data mining]], [[natural language processing]] (NLP), and [[text analytics]] provide different methods to [[pattern recognition|find patterns]] in, or otherwise interpret, this information. Common techniques for structuring text usually involve manual [[Tag (metadata)|tagging with metadata]] or [[part-of-speech tagging]] for further [[text mining]]-based structuring. The [[UIMA|Unstructured Information Management Architecture]] (UIMA) standard provided a common framework for processing this information to extract meaning and create structured data about the information.&lt;ref name = "IBMContentAnalytics"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Andreas |last1=Holzinger |first2=Christof |last2=Stocker |first3=Bernhard |last3=Ofner |first4=Gottfried |last4=Prohaska |first5=Alberto |last5=Brabenetz |first6=Rainer |last6=Hofmann-Wellenhof |year=2013 |chapter=Combining HCI, Natural Language Processing, and Knowledge Discovery – Potential of IBM Content Analytics as an Assistive Technology in the Biomedical Field |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-39146-0_2 |pages=13–24 |editor1-first=Andreas |editor1-last=Holzinger |editor2-first=Gabriella |editor2-last=Pasi |title=Human-Computer Interaction and Knowledge Discovery in Complex, Unstructured, Big Data |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-39146-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Software that creates machine-processable structure can utilize the linguistic, auditory, and visual structure that exist in all forms of human communication.&lt;ref name="IntelligentEnterprise"&gt;{{cite web |title=Structure, Models and Meaning: Is "unstructured" data merely unmodeled? |url=http://www.intelligententerprise.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=59301538 |website=InformationWeek |language=en |date=March 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algorithms can infer this inherent structure from text, for instance, by examining word [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], sentence syntax, and other small- and large-scale patterns. Unstructured information can then be enriched and tagged to address ambiguities and relevancy-based techniques then used to facilitate search and discovery. Examples of "unstructured data" may include books, journals, documents, [[metadata]], [[health record]]s, [[Sound|audio]], [[video]], [[Analog device|analog data]], images, files, and unstructured text such as the body of an [[e-mail]] message, [[Web page]], or [[word-processor]] document. While the main content being conveyed does not have a defined structure, it generally comes packaged in objects (e.g. in files or documents, …) that themselves have structure and are thus a mix of structured and unstructured data, but collectively this is still referred to as "unstructured data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Malone |first1=Robert |title=Structuring Unstructured Data |url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/04/04/teradata-solution-software-biz-logistics-cx_rm_0405data.html |website=Forbes |language=en |date=April 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an [[HTML]] web page is tagged, but HTML mark-up typically serves solely for rendering. It does not capture the meaning or function of tagged elements in ways that support automated processing of the information content of the page. [[XHTML]] tagging does allow machine processing of elements, although it typically does not capture or convey the semantic meaning of tagged terms.

Since unstructured data commonly occurs in [[electronic document]]s, the use of a [[content management|content]] or [[document management]] system which can categorize entire documents is often preferred over data transfer and manipulation from within the documents. Document management thus provides the means to convey structure onto [[text corpus|document collections]].

[[Search engines]] have become popular tools for indexing and searching through such data, especially text.

=== Approaches in natural language processing ===
Specific computational workflows have been developed to impose structure upon the unstructured data contained within text documents. These workflows are generally designed to handle sets of thousands or even millions of documents, or far more than manual approaches to annotation may permit. Several of these approaches are based upon the concept of [[Online analytical processing|online analytical processing, or OLAP]], and may be supported by data models such as text cubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lin|first=Cindy Xide|last2=Ding|first2=Bolin|last3=Han|first3=Jiawei|last4=Zhu|first4=Feida|last5=Zhao|first5=Bo|date=December 2008|title=Text Cube: Computing IR Measures for Multidimensional Text Database Analysis|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4781199/?reload=true|journal=2008 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining|language=en-US|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/icdm.2008.135|isbn=9780769535029|citeseerx=10.1.1.215.3177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once document metadata is available through a data model, generating summaries of subsets of documents (i.e., cells within a text cube) may be performed with phrase-based approaches.&lt;ref name = "textcubes"&gt;{{cite web |title=Multi-Dimensional, Phrase-Based Summarization in Text Cubes |url=http://sites.computer.org/debull/A16sept/p74.pdf |last=Tao|first=Fangbo | last2=Zhuang|first2=Honglei | last3=Yu|first3=Chi Wang| first4=Qi|last4=Wang | first5=Taylor|last5=Cassidy | first6=Lance|last6=Kaplan | first7=Clare|last7=Voss| last8=Han | first8=Jiawei | date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Approaches in medicine and biomedical research ===
Biomedical research generates one major source of unstructured data as researchers often publish their findings in scholarly journals. Though the language in these documents is challenging to derive structural elements from (e.g., due to the complicated technical vocabulary contained within and the domain knowledge required to fully contextualize observations), the results of these activities may yield links between technical and medical studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collier|first=Nigel|last2=Nazarenko|first2=Adeline|last3=Baud|first3=Robert|last4=Ruch|first4=Patrick|date=June 2006|title=Recent advances in natural language processing for biomedical applications|journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics|volume=75|issue=6|pages=413–417|doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2005.06.008|issn=1386-5056|pmid=16139564}}&lt;/ref&gt; and clues regarding new disease therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gonzalez|first=Graciela H.|last2=Tahsin|first2=Tasnia|last3=Goodale|first3=Britton C.|last4=Greene|first4=Anna C.|last5=Greene|first5=Casey S.|date=January 2016|title=Recent Advances and Emerging Applications in Text and Data Mining for Biomedical Discovery|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|volume=17|issue=1|pages=33–42|doi=10.1093/bib/bbv087|issn=1477-4054|pmc=4719073|pmid=26420781}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent efforts to enforce structure upon biomedical documents include [[self-organizing map]] approaches for identifying topics among documents,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skupin|first=André|last2=Biberstine|first2=Joseph R.|last3=Börner|first3=Katy|date=2013|title=Visualizing the topical structure of the medical sciences: a self-organizing map approach|journal=PLOS One|volume=8|issue=3|pages=e58779|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0058779|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3595294|pmid=23554924}}&lt;/ref&gt; general-purpose [[Unsupervised learning|unsupervised algorithms]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiela|first=Douwe|last2=Guo|first2=Yufan|last3=Stenius|first3=Ulla|last4=Korhonen|first4=Anna|date=2015-04-01|title=Unsupervised discovery of information structure in biomedical documents|journal=Bioinformatics|volume=31|issue=7|pages=1084–1092|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btu758|issn=1367-4811|pmid=25411329}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an application of the CaseOLAP workflow&lt;ref name = "textcubes" /&gt; to determine associations between protein names and [[cardiovascular disease]] topics in the literature.&lt;ref name="caseolapCV"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liem|first=David A.|last2=Murali|first2=Sanjana|last3=Sigdel|first3=Dibakar|last4=Shi|first4=Yu|last5=Wang|first5=Xuan|last6=Shen|first6=Jiaming|last7=Choi|first7=Howard|last8=Caufield|first8=John H.|last9=Wang|first9=Wei|last10=Ping|first10=Peipei|last11=Han|first11=Jiawei|date=Oct 1, 2018|title=Phrase mining of textual data to analyze extracellular matrix protein patterns across cardiovascular disease|journal=American Journal of Physiology.
