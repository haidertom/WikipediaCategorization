==Acquisition==
Acquisition can occur from a multitude of methods including 2D images, acquired sensor data and on site sensors.

===Acquisition from 2D images===
{{see also|Photogrammetry}}

3D data acquisition and object reconstruction can be performed using stereo image pairs. Stereo photogrammetry or photogrammetry based on a block of overlapped images is the primary approach for 3D mapping and object reconstruction using 2D images. Close-range photogrammetry has also matured to the level where cameras or digital cameras can be used to capture the close-look images of objects, e.g., buildings, and reconstruct them using the very same theory as the aerial photogrammetry. An example of software which could do this is [[Vexcel]] [[FotoG]] 5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-88825431.html Vexcel FotoG]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.directionsmag.com/article.php?article_id=628 3D data acquisition]&lt;/ref&gt; This software has now been replaced by Vexcel [[GeoSynth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vexcel.com/geospatial/geosynth/index.asp |title=Vexcel GeoSynth |access-date=2009-10-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004101204/http://www.vexcel.com/geospatial/geosynth/index.asp |archive-date=2009-10-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another similar software program is [[Microsoft Photosynth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://photosynth.net/about.aspx Photosynth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://grail.cs.washington.edu/rome/ 3D data acquisition and object reconstruction using photos]&lt;/ref&gt;

A semi-automatic method for acquiring 3D topologically structured data from 2D aerial stereo images has been presented by [[Sisi Zlatanova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gdmc.nl/zlatanova/thesis/html/refer/ps/sz_jp_kt98.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724152353/http://www.gdmc.nl/zlatanova/thesis/html/refer/ps/sz_jp_kt98.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process involves the manual digitizing of a number of points necessary for automatically reconstructing the 3D objects. Each reconstructed object is validated by superimposition of its wire frame graphics in the stereo model. The topologically structured 3D data is stored in a database and are also used for visualization of the objects. Software used for 3D data acquisition using 2D images include e.g. [[PhotoScan|Agisoft Photoscan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agisoft.com/|title=Agisoft PhotoScan|website=www.agisoft.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RealityCapture]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.capturingreality.com/|title=RealityCapture|last=|first=|date=|website=www.capturingreality.com/|language=en|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autodesk 123D Catch, ENSAIS Engineering College TIPHON (Traitement d'Image et PHOtogrammétrie Numérique).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifp.uni-stuttgart.de/publications/commIV/koehl2neu.pdf 3D data acquisition and modeling in a Topographic Information System]&lt;/ref&gt; CyberCity 3D Modeler, [http://www.3dunderworld.org/software/ 3D UNDERWORLD SLS].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite arXiv | title = 3DUNDERWORLD-SLS: An Open-Source Structured-Light Scanning System for Rapid Geometry Acquisition |author1=Kyriakos Herakleous |author2=Charalambos Poullis | year = 2014 | arxiv = 1406.6595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A method for semi-automatic building extraction together with a concept for storing building models alongside terrain and other topographic data in a topographical information system has been developed by Franz Rottensteiner. His approach was based on the integration of building parameter estimations into the photogrammetry process applying a hybrid modeling scheme. Buildings are decomposed into a set of simple primitives that are reconstructed individually and are then combined by Boolean operators. The internal data structure of both the primitives and the compound building models are based on the boundary representation methods&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.commission3.isprs.org/pia/papers/pia03_s2p1.pdf |title=Franz Rottensteiner article |access-date=2009-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220154004/http://www.commission3.isprs.org/pia/papers/pia03_s2p1.pdf |archive-date=2007-12-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Semi-automatic extraction of buildings based on hybrid adjustment using 3D surface models and management of building data in a TIS by F. Rottensteiner&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple images are used in Zeng's approach to surface reconstruction from multiple images. A central idea is to explore the integration of both 3D stereo data and 2D calibrated images. This approach is motivated by the fact that only robust and accurate feature points that survived the geometry scrutiny of multiple images are reconstructed in space. The density insufficiency and the inevitable holes in the stereo data should then be filled in by using information from multiple images. The idea is thus to first construct small surface patches from stereo points, then to progressively propagate only reliable patches in their neighborhood from images into the whole surface using a best-first strategy. The problem thus reduces to searching for an optimal local surface patch going through a given set of stereo points from images.

Multi-spectral images are also used for 3D building detection. The first and last pulse data and the normalized difference vegetation index are used in the process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmis.csiro.au/Hugues.Talbot/dicta2003/cdrom/pdf/0673.pdf Multi-spectral images for 3D building detection]&lt;/ref&gt;

New measurement techniques are also employed to obtain measurements of and between objects from single images by using the projection, or the shadow as well as their combination. This technology is gaining attention given its fast processing time, and far lower cost than stereo measurements. [[GeoTango]] [[SilverEye technology]] is the first of this kind commercial product that can produce very realistic city models and buildings from single satellite and aerial images.

===Acquisition from acquired sensor data===
Semi-Automatic building extraction from LIDAR Data and High-Resolution Images is also a possibility. Again, this approach allows modelling without physically moving towards the location or object.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gisdevelopment.net/application/urban/products/mi08_226.htm Semi-Automatic building extraction from LIDAR Data and High-Resolution Image]&lt;/ref&gt; From airborne LIDAR data, digital surface model (DSM) can be generated and then the objects higher than the ground are automatically detected from the DSM. Based on general knowledge about buildings, geometric characteristics such as size, height and shape information are then used to separate the buildings from other objects. The extracted building outlines are then simplified using an orthogonal algorithm to obtain better cartographic quality. Watershed analysis can be conducted to extract the ridgelines of building roofs. The ridgelines as well as slope information are used to classify the buildings per type. The buildings are then reconstructed using three parametric building models (flat, gabled, hipped).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrest.missouri.edu/Projects/NASA/FeatureExtraction-Buildings/Building%20Extraction Building extraction from airborne LIDAR data]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition from on-site sensors===
LIDAR and other terrestrial laser scanning technology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://geoweb.ugent.be/3dda/areas/ |title=Terrestrial laser scanning |access-date=2009-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511125642/http://geoweb.ugent.be/3dda/areas/ |archive-date=2009-05-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; offers the fastest, automated way to collect height or distance information. LIDAR or laser for height measurement of buildings is becoming very promising.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifp.uni-stuttgart.de/publications/1998/ohio_laser.pdf Terrestrial laser scanning project]&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial applications of both airborne LIDAR and ground laser scanning technology have proven to be fast and accurate methods for building height extraction. The building extraction task is needed to determine building locations, ground elevation, orientations, building size, rooftop heights, etc. Most buildings are described to sufficient details in terms of general polyhedra, i.e., their boundaries can be represented by a set of planar surfaces and straight lines. Further processing such as expressing building footprints as polygons is used for data storing in GIS databases.

Using laser scans and images taken from ground level and a bird's-eye perspective, Fruh and Zakhor present an approach to automatically create textured 3D city models. This approach involves registering and merging the detailed facade models with a complementary airborne model. The airborne modeling process generates a half-meter resolution model with a bird's-eye view of the entire area, containing terrain profile and building tops. Ground-based modeling process results in a detailed model of the building facades. Using the DSM obtained from airborne laser scans, they localize the acquisition vehicle and register the ground-based facades to the airborne model by means of Monte Carlo localization (MCL). Finally, the two models are merged with different resolutions to obtain a 3D model.

Using an airborne laser altimeter, Haala, Brenner and Anders combined height data with the existing ground plans of buildings. The ground plans of buildings had already been acquired either in analog form by maps and plans or digitally in a 2D GIS. The project was done in order to enable an automatic data capture by the integration of these different types of information. Afterwards virtual reality city models are generated in the project by texture processing, e.g. by mapping of terrestrial images. The project demonstrated the feasibility of rapid acquisition of 3D urban GIS. Ground plans proved are another very important source of information for 3D building reconstruction. Compared to results of automatic procedures, these ground plans proved more reliable since they contain aggregated information which has been made explicit by human interpretation. For this reason, ground plans, can considerably reduce costs in a reconstruction project. An example of existing ground plan data usable in building reconstruction is the [[Digital Cadastral DataBase|Digital Cadastral map]], which provides information on the distribution of property, including the borders of all agricultural areas and the ground plans of existing buildings. Additionally information as street names and the usage of buildings (e.g. garage, residential building, office block, industrial building, church) is provided in the form of text symbols. At the moment the Digital Cadastral map is built up as a data base covering an area, mainly composed by digitizing preexisting maps or plans.

===Software===
Software used for airborne laser scanning includes [[OPALS]] (Orientation and Processing of Airborne Laser Scanning data), ...&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipf.tuwien.ac.at/opals/opals_docu/index.php OPALS]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost===
* Terrestrial laser scan devices (pulse or phase devices) + processing software generally start at a price of €150,000. Some less precise devices (as the Trimble VX) cost around €75,000.
* Terrestrial LIDAR systems cost around €300,000.
* Systems using regular still cameras mounted on RC helicopters ([[Photogrammetry]]) are also possible, and cost around €25,000. Systems that use still cameras with balloons are even cheaper (around €2,500), but require additional manual processing. As the manual processing takes around 1 month of labor for every day of taking pictures, this is still an expensive solution in the long run.
* Obtaining satellite images is also an expensive endeavor. High resolution stereo images (0.5&amp;nbsp;m resolution) cost around €11,000. Image satellites include Quikbird, Ikonos. High resolution monoscopic images cost around €5,500. Somewhat lower resolution images (e.g. from the CORONA satellite; with a 2&amp;nbsp;m resolution) cost around €1.000 per 2 images. Note that Google Earth images are too low in resolution to make an accurate 3D model.&lt;ref&gt;Ghent University, Department of Geography&lt;/ref&gt;

==Object reconstruction==
{{main article|3D reconstruction}}
{{see also|3D reconstruction from multiple images}}
After the data has been collected, the acquired (and sometimes already processed) data from images or sensors needs to be reconstructed. This may be done in the same program or in some cases, the 3D data needs to be exported and imported into another program for further refining, and/or to add additional data. Such additional data could be gps-location data, ... Also, after the reconstruction, the data might be directly implemented into a local (GIS) map&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.geo.tudelft.nl/frs/papers/2001/ildi_manchester.pdf |title=Implementing data to GIS map |access-date=2009-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030506080319/http://www.geo.tudelft.nl/frs/papers/2001/ildi_manchester.pdf |archive-date=2003-05-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itc.nl/personal/vosselman/papers/suveg2001.bmvc.pdf 3D data implementation to GIS maps]&lt;/ref&gt; or a worldwide map such as [[Google Earth]].

The '''Age of Discovery''', or the '''Age of Exploration''' (approximately from the beginning of the [[15th century]] until the end of the [[18th century]]) is an informal and loosely defined term for the [[historical period|period]] in [[Europe]]an  history in which extensive overseas exploration emerged as a powerful factor in [[Culture of Europe|European culture]] and was the beginning of [[globalization]]. It also marks the rise of the period of widespread adoption in Europe of [[colonialism]] and [[mercantilism]] as national policies. Many lands previously unknown to Europeans were discovered by them during this period, though most were already inhabited. From the perspective of many non-Europeans, the Age of Discovery marked the arrival of invaders from previously unknown continents. 
 
Global exploration started with the [[Portuguese discoveries]] of the Atlantic [[archipelago]]s of [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]], the coast of Africa, and the [[discovery of the sea route to India]] in 1498; and the [[Crown of Castile]] ([[Spain]]) the trans-Atlantic [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus]] to the Americas between 1492 and 1502 and the first [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|circumnavigation of the globe]] in 1519–1522. These discoveries led to numerous naval expeditions across the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans, and land expeditions in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia that continued into the late [[19th century]], and ended with the exploration of the polar regions in the [[20th century]].

European overseas exploration led to the rise of [[global trade]] and the European [[colonial empire]]s, with the contact between the ''[[Old World]]'' (Europe, Asia and Africa) and the ''[[New World]]'' (the Americas and Australia) producing the [[Columbian Exchange]]; a wide transfer of plants, animals, food, human populations (including [[Slavery|slaves]]), [[Infectious disease|communicable disease]]s and culture between the [[Eastern Hemisphere|Eastern]] and [[Western Hemisphere|Western]] [[Hemisphere of the Earth|Hemispheres]]. This represented one of the most-significant [[globalization|global]] events concerning ecology, agriculture and culture in history. The Age of Discovery and later [[Major explorations after the Age of Discovery|European exploration]] allowed the global mapping of the world, resulting in a new world-view and distant civilizations coming into contact, but also led to the propagation of diseases that decimated populations not previously in contact with Eurasia and Africa and to the enslavement, exploitation, military conquest and economic dominance by Europe and its colonies over native populations. It also allowed for the expansion of [[Christianity]] throughout the world: with the spread of [[Christian missionary|missionary]] activity, it eventually became the [[Largest religion|world's largest religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Adherents.com, [http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html ''Religions by Adherents'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC Documentary: A History of Christianity by Diarmaid MacCulloch, Oxford University&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese began systematically exploring the Atlantic coast of Africa from 1418, under the sponsorship of [[Henry the Navigator|Prince Henry]]. Under the direction of [[Henry the Navigator]], the Portuguese developed a new, much lighter ship, the [[caravel]], which could sail further and faster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

To prevent conflict between Portugal and Castile (the crown under which Columbus made the voyage), the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] was signed dividing the world into two regions of exploration, where each had exclusive rights to claim newly discovered lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h17-am.html|title=Columbus to the Caribbean|author=|date=|work=fsmitha.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/exploration/christopher-columbus|title=Christopher Columbus – Exploration |author=|date=|work=history.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1498, a Portuguese expedition commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]] reached India by sailing around Africa, opening up direct trade with Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Diffie, Bailey W. and George D. Winius, "Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415–1580", p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; While other exploratory fleets were sent from Portugal to northern North America, in the following years [[Portuguese India Armadas]] also extended this Eastern oceanic route, touching sometimes South America and by this way opening a circuit from the New World to Asia (starting in 1500, under the command of [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]]), and explored islands in the South Atlantic and Southern Indian Oceans. Soon, the Portuguese sailed further eastward, to the valuable [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] in 1512, landing in China one year later. In 1513, Spanish [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and reached the "other sea" from the New World. Thus, Europe first received news of the eastern and western Pacific within a one-year span around 1512. East and west exploration overlapped in 1522, when a Castilian (Spanish) expedition, led by Portuguese navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]] and later by Spanish Basque navigator [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], sailing westward, completed the first circumnavigation of the world,&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, Stefan, "Conqueror of the Seas – The Story of Magellan", Read Books, 2007, {{ISBN|1-4067-6006-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Spanish ''[[conquistador]]s'' explored the interior of the Americas, and later, some of the South Pacific islands.

Since 1495, the French and English and, much later, the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] entered the race of exploration after learning of these exploits, defying the Iberian monopoly on maritime trade by searching for new routes, first to the western coasts of North and South America, through the first English and French expeditions (starting with the first expedition of [[John Cabot]] in 1497 to the north, in the service of England, followed by the French expeditions to South America and later to North America), and into the Pacific Ocean around South America, but eventually by following the Portuguese around Africa into the Indian Ocean; discovering Australia in 1606, New Zealand in 1642, and Hawaii in 1778. Meanwhile, from the 1580s to the 1640s, Russians explored and conquered almost the whole of [[Russian conquest of Siberia|Siberia]], and Alaska in the 1730s.

==Background==
{{See also|Early world maps|Chronology of European exploration of Asia}}

===Rise of European trade===
Between the 12th and 15th centuries the European economy was transformed by the interconnecting of river and sea trade routes, causing Europe to become one of the world's most prosperous trading networks.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Sea and Civilization: A Maritime History of the World |last=Paine |first= Lincoln |year= 2013 |publisher =Random House, LLC |location= New York |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|345}} 

Before the 12th century the main obstacle to trade east of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] was lack of commercial incentive rather than inadequate ship design.  Economic growth of Spain followed the reconquest of [[Al-Andalus|parts of Muslim Spain]] and the siege of Lisbon (1147 AD). The decline of [[Fatamid|Fatimid Caliphate]] naval strength that started before the [[First Crusade]] helped the maritime Italian states, mainly Venice, Genoa and Pisa, dominate trade in the eastern Mediterranean, with Italian merchants becoming wealthy and politically influential.  The [[Norman Conquest of England]] in the late 11th century allowed for peaceful trade on the North Sea. The [[Hanseatic League]], a confederation of merchant guilds and their towns in northern Germany along the North Sea and Baltic Sea, was instrumental in commercial development of the region.  In the 12th century the region of Flanders, Hainault and Braband produced the finest quality textiles in northern Europe, which encouraged merchants from Genoa and Venice to sail there directly.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|316-38}} Nicolozzo Spinola made the first recorded direct voyage from Genoa to Flanders in 1277.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|328}}

===Technology: ship design and the compass===
[[File:Sd11-boom.JPG|thumb|left|A large dhow with two lateen sail rigs and a [[headsail]].  Dhows had superior maneuverability and were used in the Indian Ocean before being built in Italy in the 13th century.]]Technological advancements that were important to the Age of Exploration were the adoption of the [[compass|magnetic compass]] and advances in ship design.  

The compass was an addition to the ancient method of navigation based on sightings of the sun and stars.  The compass had been used for navigation in China by the 11th century and was adopted by the Arab traders in the Indian Ocean. The compass spread to Europe by the late 12th or early 13th century.&lt;ref name="Merson_1990"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius That Was China: East and West in the Making of the Modern World|last=Merson |first= John|year= 1990|publisher = The Overlook Press|location=Woodstock, New York |isbn= 0-87951-397-7|pages=|postscript = &lt;A companion to the PBS Series "The Genius That Was China"&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Use of the compass for navigation in the Indian Ocean was first mentioned in 1232.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|351-2}} The first mention of use of the compass in Europe was in 1180.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|382}}  The Europeans used a "dry" compass, with a needle on a pivot.  The compass card was also a European invention.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;

[[File:Adler von Lübeck. Model ship 05.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pintle]]-and-[[gudgeon]] stern-post rudder of the [[Hanseatic league]] flagship ''[[Adler von Lübeck]]'' (1567–1581]] The Chinese also made several important improvements in ship design, such as the sternpost rudder, multiple masts and lateen sails.  These improvements gave greater maneuverability and allowed ships to sail at any time of the year.  These new style ships were produced in Italian states between 1280 and 1330, resulting in a boost in trade and connectivity between northern and southern Europe.&lt;ref name="Merson_1990"/&gt;  [[Cog (ship)|Cogs]] remained popular for trade because of their low cost. [[Galley]]s were also used in trade.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;

Ships grew in size, required smaller crews and were able to sail longer distances without stopping.  This led to significant lower long distance shipping costs by the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|342}}

===Geography and maps===
The [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]], a document dating from 40-60 AD, describes a newly discovered route through the Red Sea to India, with descriptions of the markets in towns around Red Sea, Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, including along the eastern coast of Africa, which states "for beyond these places the unexplored ocean curves around toward the west, and running along by the regions to the south of Aethiopia and Libya and Africa, it mingles with the western sea (possible reference to the Atlantic Ocean)".  European medieval knowledge about Asia beyond the reach of the [[Byzantine Empire]] was sourced in partial reports, often obscured by legends,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; dating back from the time of the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] and his successors. 
Another source was the [[Radhanite|Radhanite Jewish trade networks]] of merchants established as go-betweens between Europe and the Muslim world during the time of the [[Crusader states]].

[[File:Ptolemy Cosmographia 1467 - world map.jpg|thumb|[[Ptolemy's world map]] (2nd century) in a 15th-century reconstruction]]
In 1154, the [[Geography in medieval Islam|Arab geographer]] [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] created a description of the world and a [[world map]], the [[Tabula Rogeriana]], at the court of King [[Roger II of Sicily]],&lt;ref name=houben&gt;Houben, 2002, pp. 102–04.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harley&gt;Harley &amp; Woodward, 1992, pp. 156–61.&lt;/ref&gt; but still Africa was only partially known to either Christians, Genoese and Venetians, or the Arab seamen, and its southern extent unknown. There were reports of great African [[Sahara]], but the factual knowledge was limited for the Europeans to the Mediterranean coasts and little else since the Arab blockade of North Africa precluded exploration inland. Knowledge about the Atlantic African coast was fragmented and derived mainly from [[Early world maps|old]] Greek and Roman maps based on Carthaginian knowledge, including the time of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] exploration of [[Mauritania]]. The [[Red Sea]] was barely known and only trade links with the [[Maritime republics]], the [[Republic of Venice]] especially, fostered collection of accurate maritime knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Ocean trade routes were sailed by Arab traders. Between 1405 and 1421, the [[Yongle Emperor]] of [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] sponsored a series of long range [[Treasure voyages|tributary missions]] under the command of [[Zheng He]] (Cheng Ho).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The fleets visited [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], [[East Africa]], [[India]], [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] and [[Thailand]]. But the journeys, reported by [[Ma Huan]], a [[Muslim]] voyager and translator, were halted abruptly after the emperor's death&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and were not followed up, as the Chinese [[Ming Dynasty]] retreated in the ''[[haijin]]'', a policy of [[isolationism]], having limited maritime trade.

By 1400 a Latin translation of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia]]'' reached Italy coming from Constantinople. The rediscovery of Roman geographical knowledge was a revelation,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; both for mapmaking and worldview,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Love 2006|Love 2006]], p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; although reinforcing the idea that the Indian Ocean was landlocked.

=== Medieval travel (1241–1438) ===
[[File:Silk route copy.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[Silk Road]] and [[spice trade]] routes later blocked by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453 spurring exploration to find alternative sea routes]]
[[File:Travels of Marco Polo.png|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Marco Polo]] travels (1271–1295)]]

A prelude to the Age of Discovery was a series of European expeditions crossing [[Eurasia]] by land in the late Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#silk-road 2008|silk-road 2008]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Mongols]] had threatened Europe with pillage and destruction,{{clarify|date=August 2013}} Mongol states also unified much of Eurasia and, from 1206 on, the ''[[Pax Mongolica]]'' allowed safe trade routes and communication lines stretching from the Middle East to China.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A series of Europeans took advantage of these to explore eastwards. Most were Italians, as trade between Europe and the Middle East was controlled mainly by the [[Maritime republics]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The close [[Italian city-states|Italian]] links to the [[Levant]] raised great curiosity and commercial interest in countries which lay further east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=City of Fortune|last=Crowley|first=Roger|date=2011|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|isbn=9780571245956|edition=Main|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}}

There are a few accounts of merchants from North Africa and the Mediterranean region who traded in the Indian Ocean in late medieval times.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;

Christian embassies were sent as far as [[Karakorum]] during the [[Mongol invasions of the Levant]], from which they gained a greater understanding of the world.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The first of these travellers was [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]], dispatched by [[Pope Innocent IV]] to the [[Great Khan]], who journeyed to [[Mongolia]] and back from 1241 to 1247.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; About the same time, Russian prince [[Yaroslav of Vladimir]], and subsequently his sons [[Alexander Nevsky]] and [[Andrey II of Vladimir]], travelled to the Mongolian capital. Though having strong political implications, their journeys left no detailed accounts. Other travellers followed, like French [[André de Longjumeau]] and Flemish [[William of Rubruck]], who reached China through Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marco Polo]], a Venetian merchant, dictated an account of journeys throughout Asia from 1271 to 1295, describing being a guest at the [[Yuan Dynasty]] court of [[Kublai Khan]] in ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Travels]]'', and it was read throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1291, in a first Atlantic exploration attempt, merchant brothers [[Vadino and Ugolino Vivaldi]] sailed from Genoa with two galleys but disappeared off the Moroccan coast, feeding the fears of oceanic travel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 2006|Parry 2006]], p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1325 to 1354, a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] scholar from [[Tangier]], [[Ibn Battuta]], journeyed through North Africa, the Sahara desert, West Africa, Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East and Asia, having reached China. After returning, he dictated an account of his journeys to a scholar he met in Granada, the ''[[Rihla]]'' ("The Journey"),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dunn 2004|Dunn 2004]], p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; the unheralded source on his adventures. Between 1357 and 1371 a book of supposed travels compiled by [[John Mandeville]] acquired extraordinary popularity. Despite the unreliable and often fantastical nature of its accounts it was used as a reference&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 1999|Mancall 1999]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; for the East, Egypt, and the Levant in general, asserting the old belief that Jerusalem was the [[Axis mundi|centre of the world]].

Following the period of [[Timurid relations with Europe]], in 1439 [[Niccolò de' Conti]] published an account of his travels as a Muslim merchant to India and Southeast Asia and, later in 1466–1472, Russian merchant [[Afanasy Nikitin]] of [[Tver]] travelled to India, which he described in his book ''[[A Journey Beyond the Three Seas]]''.

These overland journeys had little immediate effect. The [[Mongol Empire]] collapsed almost as quickly as it formed and soon the route to the east became more difficult and dangerous. The [[Black Death]] of the 14th century also blocked travel and trade.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]] further limited the possibilities of European overland trade.

===Chinese missions (1405–1433)===
{{Further|Treasure voyages|Chinese exploration}}
[[File:Stellardiagram-Zhengho.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|"Mao Kun map", believed to be based on [[Zheng He]]'s travels, showing sailing directions between ports of SE Asia and as far as Malindi, in ''[[Wu Bei Zhi]]'' (1628)]]
The Chinese had wide connections through trade in Asia and had been sailing to [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], and [[Egypt]] since the [[Tang Dynasty]] (AD 618–907). Between 1405 and 1421 the third Ming emperor [[Yongle Emperor|Yongle]] sponsored a series of long range [[tribute|tributary missions]] in the Indian Ocean under the command of admiral [[Zheng He]] (Cheng Ho).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A large fleet of new [[Junk (ship)|junk]] ships was prepared for these international diplomatic expeditions. The largest of these junks—that the Chinese termed [[Chinese treasure ship|''bao chuan'' (treasure ships)]]—may have measured 121 metres (400&amp;nbsp;feet) stem to stern, and thousands of sailors were involved. The first expedition departed in 1405. At least seven well-documented expeditions were launched, each bigger and more expensive than the last. The fleets visited [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], [[India]], [[Malay Archipelago]] and [[Thailand]] (at the time called [[Siam]]), exchanging goods along the way.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tamura 1997|Tamura 1997]], p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; They presented gifts of gold, silver, [[porcelain]] and [[silk]]; in return, received such novelties as [[ostrich]]es, [[zebra]]s, [[camel]]s, [[ivory]] and [[giraffe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cromer 1995|Cromer 1995]], p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tsai 2002|Tsai 2002]], p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; After the emperor's death, Zheng He led a final expedition departing from Nanking in 1431 and returning to Beijing in 1433. It is very likely that this last expedition reached as far as [[Madagascar]]. The travels were reported by [[Ma Huan]], a Muslim voyager and translator who accompanied Zheng He on three of the seven expeditions, his account published as "Ying-Yai Sheng-Lam" (Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores) (1433).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

These long distance journeys were not followed up, as the Chinese Ming dynasty retreated in the ''[[haijin]]'', a policy of [[isolationism]], having limited maritime trade. Travels were halted abruptly after the emperor's death, as the Chinese lost interest in what they termed barbarian lands turning inward,&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; and successor emperors felt the expeditions were harmful to the Chinese state; [[Hongxi Emperor]] ended further expeditions and [[Xuande Emperor]] suppressed much of the information about Zheng He's voyages.

[[File:Republik Venedig Handelswege01.png|thumb|[[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] (red) and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] (green) maritime trade routes in the Mediterranean and [[Black Sea]]]]

From the 8th century until the 15th century, the [[Republic of Venice]] and neighbouring [[maritime republics]] held the monopoly of European trade with the Middle East.   The [[Silk Road|silk]] and [[spice trade]], involving [[spice]]s, [[incense]], [[herb]]s, [[drug]]s and [[opium]], made these Mediterranean city-states phenomenally rich. Spices were among the most expensive and demanded products of the Middle Ages, as they were used in [[medieval medicine]],&lt;ref&gt;Spice importance for medieval [[humorism]] principles of medicine was such that shortly after entering the trade, apothecaries and physicians like [[Tomé Pires]] and [[Garcia de Orta|Garcia da Orta]] (see [[#Burns 2001|Burns 2001]], p. 14) were sent to India having studied spices in works like ''Suma Oriental'' (see [[#Pires 1512|Pires 1512]], p. lxii) and ''[[Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India]]'' ("Conversations on the simples, drugs and materia medica of India)&lt;/ref&gt; religious [[ritual]]s, [[cosmetics]], [[perfume]]ry, as well as [[food additive]]s and [[Food preservatives|preservatives]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#ScienceDaily 1998|ScienceDaily 1998]], news.&lt;/ref&gt; They were all imported from Asia and Africa.

Muslim traders—mainly descendants of Arab sailors from [[Yemen]] and [[Oman]]—dominated maritime routes throughout the Indian Ocean, tapping source regions in the Far East and shipping for trading emporiums in India, mainly [[Kozhikode]], westward to [[Ormus]] in the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Jeddah]] in the [[Red Sea]]. From there, overland routes led to the Mediterranean coasts. Venetian merchants distributed the goods through Europe until the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], that eventually led to the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, barring Europeans from important combined-land-sea routes.&lt;ref name=GT-DEX-1453-09&gt;{{cite web|title=

Forced to reduce their activities in the Black Sea, and at war with Venice, the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] had turned to North African trade of wheat, [[olive oil]] (valued also as an energy source) and a search for silver and gold. Europeans had a constant [[Commercial Revolution#Monetary factors|deficit in silver and gold]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spufford 1989|Spufford 1989]], pp. 339–49.&lt;/ref&gt; as coin only went one way: out, spent on eastern trade that was now cut off. Several European mines were exhausted,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spufford 1989|Spufford 1989]], p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of [[bullion]] leading to the development of a complex banking system to manage the risks in trade (the very first state bank, ''[[Bank of Saint George|Banco di San Giorgio]]'', was founded in 1407 at Genoa). Sailing also into the ports of [[Bruges]] (Flanders) and England, Genoese communities were then established in Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; who profited from their enterprise and financial expertise.

European sailing had been primarily close to land [[cabotage]], guided by [[portolan chart]]s. These charts specified proven ocean routes guided by coastal landmarks: sailors departed from a known point, followed a [[compass]] heading, and tried to identify their location by its landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 1981|Parry 1981]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first oceanic exploration Western Europeans used the [[compass]], as well as progressive new advances in [[cartography]] and [[astronomy]]. Arab navigational tools like the [[astrolabe]] and [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] were used for [[celestial navigation]].

In 1297, with the Portuguese part of the [[reconquista]] completed, King [[Dinis of Portugal]] took personal interest in exports and in 1317 he made an agreement with Genoese merchant sailor [[Manuel Pessanha]] (Pesagno), appointing him first [[admiral]] of the [[Portuguese navy]], with the goal of defending the country against Muslim pirate raids.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Outbreaks of [[bubonic plague]] led to severe depopulation in the second half of the 14th century: only the sea offered alternatives, with most population settling in fishing and trading coastal areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Newitt 2005|Newitt 2005]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1325 and 1357 [[Afonso IV of Portugal]] encouraged maritime commerce and ordered the first explorations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1960|Diffie 1960]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canary Islands]], already known to the Genoese, were claimed as officially discovered under patronage of the Portuguese but in 1344 Castile disputed them, expanding their rivalry into the sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butel 1999|Butel 1999]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure their monopoly on trade, Europeans (beginning with the Portuguese) attempted to install a mediterranean system of trade which used military might and intimidation to divert trade through ports they controlled; there it could be taxed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trade and Civilization in the Indian Ocean: An Economic History from the Rise of Islam to 1750|last=Chaudhuri|first=K. N.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1415, [[Ceuta]] was [[Battle of Ceuta|conquered]] by the Portuguese aiming to control navigation of the African coast. Young prince [[Henry the Navigator]] was there and became aware of profit possibilities in the [[Trans-Saharan trade]] routes. For centuries [[Arab slave trade|slave and gold]] trade routes linking West Africa with the Mediterranean passed over the Western Sahara Desert, controlled by the Moors of North Africa.

Henry wished to know how far Muslim territories in Africa extended, hoping to bypass them and trade directly with West Africa by sea, find allies in legendary Christian lands to the south&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; like the long-lost Christian kingdom of [[Prester John]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anderson 2000|Anderson 2000]], p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and to probe whether it was possible to reach the [[Indies]] by sea, the source of the lucrative [[spice trade]]. He invested in sponsoring voyages down the coast of [[Mauritania]], gathering a group of merchants, shipowners and stakeholders interested in new sea lanes. Soon the Atlantic islands of [[Madeira]] (1419) and the [[Azores]] (1427) were reached. In particular, they were discovered by voyages launched by the command of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]]. The expedition leader himself, who established settlements on the island of Madeira, was [[João Gonçalves Zarco]].&lt;ref&gt;Joaquinn Pedro Oliveira Martins, The Golden Age Of Prince Henry The Navigator. (New York: Dutton), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, Europeans did not know what lay beyond [[Cape Non]] (Cape Chaunar) on the African coast, and whether it was possible to return once it was crossed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Locke 1824|Locke 1824]], p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; Nautical myths warned of oceanic monsters or an edge of the world, but Prince Henry's navigation challenged such beliefs: starting in 1421, systematic sailing overcame it, reaching the difficult [[Cape Bojador]] that in 1434 one of Prince Henry's captains, [[Gil Eanes]], finally passed.

A major advance was the introduction of the [[caravel]] in the mid-15th century, a small ship able to sail [[Windward and leeward|windward]] more than any other in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1969|Boxer 1969]], p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolved from fishing ships designs, they were the first that could leave the coastal [[cabotage]] navigation and sail safely on the open Atlantic. For [[celestial navigation]] the Portuguese used the [[Ephemerides]], which experienced a remarkable diffusion in the 15th century. These were astronomical charts plotting the location of the stars over a distinct period of time. Published in 1496 by the Jewish astronomer, astrologer, and mathematician [[Abraham Zacuto]], the [[Almanach Perpetuum]] included some of these tables for the movements of stars.&lt;ref&gt;Nissan Mindel, Rabbi Abraham Zacuto – (1450–1515), http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/111917/jewish/Rabbi-Abraham-Zacuto.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These tables revolutionized navigation, allowing the calculation of [[latitude]]. Exact [[longitude]], however, remained elusive, and mariners struggled to determine it for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 1981|Parry 1981]], p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 132–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the caravel, systematic exploration continued ever more southerly, advancing on average one degree a year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Russell-Wood 1998|Russell-Wood 1998]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Senegal]] and [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde Peninsula]] were reached in 1445 and in 1446, [[Álvaro Fernandes]] pushed on almost as far as present-day [[Sierra Leone]].

In 1453 the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the hands of the [[Ottomans]] was a blow to Christendom and the established business relations linking with the east. In 1455 [[Pope Nicholas V]] issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Romanus Pontifex]]'' reinforcing the previous ''[[Dum Diversas]]'' (1452), granting all lands and seas discovered beyond Cape Bojador to King [[Afonso V of Portugal]] and his successors, as well as trade and conquest against Muslims and pagans, initiating a ''[[mare clausum]]'' policy in the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Daus 1983|Daus 1983]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The king, who had been inquiring of Genoese experts about a seaway to India, commissioned the [[Fra Mauro map|Fra Mauro world map]], which arrived in Lisbon in 1459.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bagrow 1964|Bagrow 1964]], p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1456 [[Diogo Gomes]] reached the [[Cape Verde]] archipelago. In the next decade several captains at the service of Prince Henry – including the Genoese [[Antonio da Noli]] and Venetian [[Alvise Cadamosto]] – discovered the remaining islands which were occupied during the 15th century. The Gulf of Guinea would be reached in the 1460s.

==== Portuguese exploration after Prince Henry ====
In 1460 [[Pedro de Sintra]] reached Sierra Leone. Prince Henry died in November that year after which, given the meagre revenues, exploration was granted to Lisbon merchant [[Fernão Gomes]] in 1469, who in exchange for the monopoly of trade in the Gulf of Guinea had to explore {{convert|100|mi|0|abbr=off}} each year for five years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 145–48.&lt;/ref&gt; With his sponsorship, explorers [[João de Santarém]], [[Pedro Escobar]], Lopo Gonçalves, [[Fernão do Pó]], and Pedro de Sintra made it even beyond those goals. They reached the Southern Hemisphere and the islands of the Gulf of Guinea, including [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] and [[Elmina]] on the Gold Coast in 1471. (In the Southern Hemisphere, they used the [[Southern Cross]] as the reference for celestial navigation.) There, in what came to be called the "Gold Coast" in what is today [[Ghana]], a thriving alluvial gold trade was found among the natives and Arab and [[Berbers|Berber]] traders.

In 1478 (during the War of the Castilian Succession), near the coast at Elmina was fought a large battle between a Castilian armada of 35 caravels and a Portuguese fleet for hegemony of the Guinea trade (gold, slaves, ivory and melegueta pepper). The war ended with a Portuguese naval victory followed by the official recognition by the Catholic Monarchs of Portuguese sovereignty over most of the disputed West African territories embodied in the Treaty of Alcáçovas, 1479. (See entry on Elmina.) This was the first colonial war among European powers.

In 1481 the recently crowned [[John II of Portugal|João II]] decided to build [[Elmina Castle|São Jorge da Mina]] [[factory (trading post)|factory]]. In 1482 the [[Congo River]] was explored by [[Diogo Cão]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; who in 1486 continued to [[Cape Cross]] (modern [[Namibia]]).

The next crucial breakthrough was in 1488, when [[Bartolomeu Dias]] rounded the southern tip of Africa, which he named "Cape of Storms" (Cabo das Tormentas), anchoring at [[Mossel Bay]] and then sailing east as far as the mouth of the [[Great Fish River]], proving that the Indian Ocean was accessible from the Atlantic. Simultaneously [[Pêro da Covilhã]], sent out travelling secretly overland, had reached [[Ethiopia]] having collected important information about the Red Sea and Quenia coast, suggesting that a sea route to the Indies would soon be forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anderson 2000|Anderson 2000]], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the cape was renamed by king [[John II of Portugal]] the "[[Cape of Good Hope]]" (Cabo da Boa Esperança), because of the great optimism engendered by the possibility of a sea route to India, proving false the view that had existed since [[Ptolemy]] that the Indian Ocean was [[Landlocked country|land-locked]].

Based on much later stories of the [[phantom island]] known as [[Bacalao]] and the carvings on [[Dighton Rock]] some have speculated that Portuguese explorer [[João Vaz Corte-Real]] discovered [[Newfoundland]] in 1473, but the sources cited are considered by mainstream historians to be unreliable and unconvincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lusa|title=Portugueses chegaram à América 19 anos antes de Colombo|url=https://expresso.sapo.pt/cultura/2016-02-27-Portugueses-chegaram-a-America-19-anos-antes-de-Colombo|publisher=Expresso}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish exploration: Columbus and the West Indies===
{{see also|Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Spanish colonization of the Americas}}
[[File:Viajes de colon en.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|The four voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]] 1492–1503]]

Portugal's neighbouring fellow Iberian rival, [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], had begun to establish its rule over the [[Canary Islands]], located off the west African coast, in 1402, but then became distracted by internal Iberian politics and the repelling of Islamic invasion attempts and raids through most of the 15th century. Only late in the century, following the unification of the crowns of Castile and Aragon and the completion of the ''[[reconquista]]'', did an emerging modern Spain become fully committed to the search for new trade routes overseas. The [[Crown of Aragon]] had been an important maritime potentate in the Mediterranean, controlling territories in eastern Spain, southwestern France, major islands like [[Sicily]], [[Malta]], and the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and [[Sardinia]], with mainland possessions as far as Greece. In 1492 the [[Catholic Monarchs|joint rulers]] conquered the [[Emirate of Granada|Moorish kingdom of Granada]], which had been providing Castile with African goods through tribute, and decided to fund [[Christopher Columbus]]'s expedition in the hope of bypassing Portugal's monopoly on west African sea routes, to reach "the Indies" (east and south Asia) by travelling west.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; Twice before, in 1485 and 1488, Columbus had presented the project to king [[John II of Portugal]], who rejected it.

On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from [[Palos de la Frontera]] with three ships; one larger [[carrack]], ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'', nicknamed ''Gallega'' (''the Galician''), and two smaller [[caravel]]s, ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' (''the Painted'') and ''Santa Clara'', nicknamed ''[[Niña]]''. Columbus first sailed to the Canary Islands, where he restocked for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean, crossing a section of the Atlantic that became known as the [[Sargasso Sea]].

Land was sighted on 12 October 1492, and Columbus called the island (now [[The Bahamas]]) ''San Salvador'', in what he thought to be the "[[Caribbean|West Indies]]". Columbus also explored the northeast coast of [[Cuba]] (landed on 28 October) and the northern coast of [[Hispaniola]], by 5 December. He was received by the native [[cacique]] [[Guacanagaríx|Guacanagari]], who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind.
[[File:TresCarabelas.jpg|thumb|left|Replicas of ''[[Niña]]'', ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' and ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'' at [[Palos de la Frontera]], Spain]] Columbus left 39 men and founded the settlement of ''[[La Navidad]]'' in what is now [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Maclean 2008|Maclean 2008]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Before returning to Spain, he kidnapped some ten to twenty-five natives and took them back with him. Only seven or eight of the native 'Indians' arrived in Spain alive, but they made quite an impression on Seville.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Forbes 1993|Forbes 1993]], p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;
On the return, a storm forced him to dock in [[Lisbon]], on 4 March 1493. After a week in Portugal, he set sail for Spain and on 15 March 1493 arrived in [[Barcelona]], where he reported to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand. Word of his discovery of new lands [[Columbus's Letter on the First Voyage|rapidly spread throughout Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 1999|Mancall 1999]], p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus and other Spanish explorers were initially disappointed with their discoveries—unlike Africa or Asia, the Caribbean islanders had little to trade with the Castilian ships. The islands thus became the focus of colonization efforts. It was not until the continent itself was explored that Spain found the wealth it had sought.

===Treaty of Tordesillas (1494)===
{{Main|Treaty of Tordesillas}}
[[File:Spain and Portugal.png|upright=0.9|thumb|The 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesilhas Treaty]] meridian (purple) and the later [[Maluku Islands]] [[180th meridian|antimeridian]] (green), set at the [[Treaty of Zaragoza (1529)]]]]

Shortly after Columbus's return from what would later be called the "West Indies", a division of influence became necessary to avoid conflict between the Spanish and Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 May 1493, two months after Columbus's arrival, the [[Catholic Monarchs]] received a [[Papal bull|bull]] (''[[Inter caetera]]'') from [[Pope Alexander VI]] stating that all lands west and south of a pole-to-pole line 100 leagues west and south of the [[Azores]] or the Cape Verde Islands should belong to Castile and, later, all mainlands and islands then belonging to India. It did not mention Portugal, which could not claim newly discovered lands east of the line.

King [[John II of Portugal]] was not pleased with the arrangement, feeling that it gave him far too little land—preventing him from reaching India, his main goal. He then negotiated directly with King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] of Spain to move the line west, and allowing him to claim newly discovered lands east of it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Davenport 1917|Davenport 1917]], pp. 107–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

An agreement was reached in 1494, with the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] that divided the world between the two powers. In this treaty the Portuguese received everything outside Europe east of a line that ran 370 [[league (unit)|leagues]] west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands (already Portuguese), and the islands discovered by [[Christopher Columbus]] on his first voyage (claimed for Castile), named in the treaty as [[Names of Japan#Jipangu|Cipangu]] and [[Antilia]] ([[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]]). This gave them control over Africa, Asia and eastern South America (Brazil). The Spanish (Castile) received everything west of this line.  At the time of negotiation, the treaty split the known world of Atlantic islands roughly in half, with the dividing line about halfway between Portuguese Cape Verde and the Spanish discoveries in the Caribbean.

[[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] encountered in 1500 what is now known as the Brazilian coast, originally thought to be a large island.  Since it was east of the dividing line, he claimed it for Portugal and this was respected by the Spanish.  Portuguese ships sailed west into the Atlantic to get favourable winds for the journey to India, and this is where Cabral was headed on his journey, in a corridor the treaty was negotiated to protect.  Some suspect the Portuguese had secretly discovered Brazil earlier, and this is why they had the line moved eastward and how Cabral found it, but there is no reliable evidence of this.  Others suspect [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] secretly discovered Brazil in 1498, but this not considered credible by mainstream historians.

Later the Spanish territory would prove to include huge areas of the continental mainland of North and South America, though Portuguese-controlled Brazil would expand across the line, and settlements by other European powers ignored the treaty.

===A New World: Americas===
[[File:Waldseemuller map closeup with America.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of 1507 [[Waldseemüller map]] showing the name "America" for the first time.]]
Very little of the divided area had actually been seen by Europeans, as it was only divided by a geographical definition rather than control on the ground. Columbus's first voyage in 1492 spurred maritime exploration and, from 1497, a number of explorers headed west.

====North America====
That year [[John Cabot]], also a commissioned Italian, got [[letters patent]] from King [[Henry VII of England]]. Sailing from [[Bristol]], probably backed by the local [[Society of Merchant Venturers]], Cabot crossed the Atlantic from a northerly latitude hoping the voyage to the "West Indies" would be shorter&lt;ref&gt;[[#Croxton 2007|Croxton 2007]], web (on subscription)&lt;/ref&gt; and made a landfall somewhere in North America, possibly [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].
In 1499 [[João Fernandes Lavrador]] was licensed by the King of Portugal and together with [[Pêro de Barcelos]] they first sighted [[Labrador]], which was granted and named after him. After returning he possibly went to Bristol to sail in the name of England.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 463–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly at the same time, between 1499 and 1502 brothers [[Gaspar Corte-Real|Gaspar]] and [[Miguel Corte-Real|Miguel Corte Real]] explored and named the coasts of [[Greenland]] and also Newfoundland.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 464–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Both explorations are noted in the 1502 [[Cantino planisphere]].

====The "True Indies" and Brazil====
In 1497, newly crowned King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] sent an exploratory fleet eastwards, fulfilling his predecessor's project of finding a route to the Indies. In July 1499 news spread that the Portuguese had reached the "true indies", as a letter was dispatched by the Portuguese king to the Spanish Catholic Monarchs one day after the celebrated return of the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third expedition by Columbus in 1498 was the beginning of the first successful Castilian (Spanish) colonization in the [[West Indies]], on the island of Hispaniola. Despite growing doubts, Columbus refused to accept that he had not reached the Indies. During the voyage he discovered the mouth of the [[Orinoco River]] on the north coast of South America (now Venezuela) and thought that the huge quantity of fresh water coming from it could only be from a continental land mass, which he was certain was the Asian mainland.

As shipping between [[Seville]] and the West Indies grew, knowledge of the Caribbean islands, Central America and the northern coast of South America grew.
One of these Spanish fleets, that of [[Alonso de Ojeda]] and [[Amerigo Vespucci]] in 1499–1500, reached land at the coast of what is now [[Guyana]], when the two explorers seem to have separated in opposite directions. Vespucci sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the [[Amazon River]] in July 1499,&lt;ref name=Pohl1966&gt;{{cite book

In the beginning of 1500 [[Vicente Yáñez Pinzon]] was blown off course by a storm and reached what is now the north east coast of Brazil on 26 January 1500, exploring as far south as the present-day state of [[Pernambuco]]. His fleet was the first to fully enter the Amazon River estuary which he named ''Río Santa María de la Mar Dulce'' (''Saint Mary's River of the Freshwater Sea'').&lt;ref name=Morison1974&gt;{{cite book

The 1515–16 expedition was spurred on by reports of Portuguese exploration of the region (see below). It ended when de Solís and some of his crew disappeared when exploring a [[Río de la Plata|River Plate]] river in a boat, but what it found re-ignited Spanish interest, and colonization began in 1531.

In April 1500, the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|second Portuguese India Armada]], headed by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], with a crew of expert captains, including Bartolomeu Dias and [[Nicolau Coelho]], encountered the Brazilian coast as it swung westward in the Atlantic while performing a large "[[volta do mar]]" to avoid becalming in the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. On 21 April 1500 a mountain was seen and was named ''[[Monte Pascoal]]'', and on 22 April Cabral landed on the coast. On 25 April the entire fleet sailed into the harbour they named ''[[Porto Seguro]]'' (Port Secure). Cabral perceived that the new land lay east of the line of Tordesillas, and sent an envoy to Portugal with the discovery in letters, including the [[carta de Pêro Vaz de Caminha|letter]] of [[Pero Vaz de Caminha]]. Believing the land to be an island, he named it [[Ilha de Vera Cruz]] (Island of the True Cross).&lt;ref&gt;N. McAlister, Lyle. (1984) ''Spain and Portugal in the New World: 1492–1700.'' p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have suggested that the Portuguese may have encountered the South American bulge earlier while sailing the "volta do mar", hence the insistence of John II in moving the line west of Tordesillas in 1494—so his landing in Brazil may not have been an accident; although John's motivation may have simply been to increase the chance of claiming new lands in the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crow 1992|Crow 1992]], p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; From the east coast, the fleet then turned eastward to resume the journey to the southern tip of Africa and India. Cabral was the first captain to touch four continents, leading the first expedition that connected and united Europe, Africa, the New World, and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hBTqPX4G9Y4C&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=Cabral+four+continents&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zPIIU8HvE-af7AakkYDICw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Cabral%20four%20continents&amp;f=false ''Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415–1580''], Bailey Wallys Diffie and George D.

At the invitation of King Manuel I of Portugal, Amerigo Vespucci&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 456–62.&lt;/ref&gt;—a Florentine who had been working for a branch of the [[Medici Bank]] in [[Seville]] since 1491, fitting oceanic expeditions and travelling twice to [[The Guianas]] with [[Juan de la Cosa]] in the service of Spain&lt;ref&gt;[[#Catholic Encyclopædia 2|Catholic Encyclopædia 2]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;—participated as observer in these exploratory voyages to the east coast of South America. The expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to him, published between 1502 and 1504, suggested that the newly discovered lands were not the Indies but a "[[New World]]",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arciniegas 1978|Arciniegas 1978]], pp. 295–300.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Mundus novus'', Latin title of a contemporary document based on Vespucci letters to [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], which had become widely popular in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 458.&lt;/ref&gt; It was soon understood that Columbus had not reached Asia but had found a new continent, the Americas. [[America (name)|The Americas were named]] in 1507 by [[Cartography|cartographer]]s [[Waldseemüller map|Martin Waldseemüller]] and [[Matthias Ringmann]], probably after Amerigo Vespucci.

In 1501–1502, one of these Portuguese expeditions, led by [[Gonçalo Coelho]] (and/or [[André Gonçalves (explorer)|André Gonçalves]] or [[Gaspar de Lemos]]), sailed south along the coast of South America to the bay of present-day [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Amerigo Vespucci's account states that the expedition reached the latitude "South Pole elevation 52° S", in the "cold" latitudes of what is now southern [[Patagonia]] (possibly near the Strait), before turning back. Vespucci wrote that they headed toward the southwest and south, following "a long, unbending coastline" (apparently coincident with the southern South American coast). This seems controversial, since he changed part of his description in the subsequent letter, stating a shift, from about 32° S (Southern Brazil), to south-southeast, to open sea; maintaining, however, that they reached 50°/52° S (if it was by his own decision or by D. Manuel's censors who had to pressure him to alter his account, because he had revealed far too much to Lorenzo de' Medici and into the public domain, is unknown).&lt;ref&gt;[http://icaadocs.mfah.org/icaadocs/THEARCHIVE/FullRecord/tabid/88/doc/839287/language/en-US/Default.aspx The Invention of America].

In 1503, [[Binot Paulmier de Gonneville]], challenging the Portuguese policy of ''[[mare clausum]]'', led one of the earliest [[French people|French]] [[Normandy|Normand]] and [[Brittany|Breton]] expeditions to Brazil. He intended to sail to the East Indies, but near the Cape of Good Hope his ship was diverted to west by a storm, and landed in the present day state of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] (southern Brazil), on 5 January 1504.

In 1511–1512, Portuguese captains [[João de Lisboa]] and Estevão de Fróis reached the [[Rio de La Plata|River Plate]] estuary in present-day [[Uruguay]] and [[Argentina]], and went as far south as the present-day [[Gulf of San Matias]] at 42°S (recorded in the ''Newen Zeytung auss Pressilandt'' meaning "New Tidings from the Land of Brazil").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Also gives the first news of the ''White King'' and the "people of the mountains" to the interior (the [[Inca Empire]]), and a gift, an ax of silver, obtained from the [[Charrúa]] natives on their return ("to the coast or side of ''Brazil''"), and "to West" (along the coast and the River Plate estuary), and offered to King Manuel I.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblio.wdfiles.com/local--files/schuller-1915-nova/schuller_1915_nova.pdf Newen Zeytung auss Presillg Landt]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher de Haro]], a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] of [[Sephardic]] origin (one of the financiers of the expedition along with D. Nuno Manuel), who would serve the Spanish Crown after 1516, believed that the navigators had discovered a southern ''strait'' to west and Asia.

In 1519, an expedition sent by the Spanish Crown to find a way to Asia was led by the experienced Portuguese navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]]. The fleet explored the rivers and bays as it charted the South American coast until it found a way to the Pacific Ocean through the [[Strait of Magellan]].

In 1524–1525, [[Aleixo Garcia]], a Portuguese conquistador (possibly a veteran of the Solís expedition of 1516), led a private expedition of a few shipwrecked Castilian and Portuguese adventurers, that recruited about 2000 [[Guaraní people|Guaraní Indians]]. They explored the territories of present-day southern Brazil, [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]], using the native trail network, the ''Peabiru''. They were also the first Europeans to cross the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] and reach the outer territories of the Inca Empire on the hills of the [[Andes]], near [[Sucre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novomilenio.inf.br/sv/svh009b.htm ''Peabiru, the route lost''] in English&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gama's route to India===

{{see also|Portuguese India Armadas}}

[[File:Caminho maritimo para a India.png|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Vasco da Gama]]'s 1497–1499 travel to India (black). Previous travels of [[Pêro da Covilhã]] (orange) and [[Afonso de Paiva]] (blue), and their common route (green)]]

Protected from direct Spanish competition by the treaty of Tordesillas, Portuguese eastward exploration and colonization continued apace. Twice, in 1485 and 1488, Portugal officially rejected [[Christopher Columbus]]'s idea of reaching India by sailing westwards. King [[John II of Portugal]]'s experts rejected it, for they held the opinion that Columbus's estimation of a travel distance of {{convert|2400|mi|km|-1}} was undervalued,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morison 1942|Morison 1942]], pp. 65–75.&lt;/ref&gt; and in part because [[Bartolomeu Dias]] departed in 1487 trying the rounding of the southern tip of Africa, therefore they believed that sailing east would require a far shorter journey. Dias's return from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1488, and [[Pêro da Covilhã]]'s travel to [[Ethiopia]] overland indicated that the richness of the [[Indian Ocean|Indian Sea]] was accessible from the Atlantic. A long-overdue expedition was prepared.

[[File:Map of Portuguese Carreira da India.gif|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Outward and return voyages of the [[Portuguese India Armadas]] in the Atlantic and the Indian oceans, with the [[North Atlantic Gyre]] (''[[Volta do mar]]'') picked up by [[Henry the Navigator|Henry]]'s navigators, and the outward route of the South Atlantic westerlies that [[Bartolomeu Dias]] discovered in 1488, followed and explored by the expeditions of [[Vasco da Gama]] and [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]]]]

Under new king [[Manuel I of Portugal]], on July 1497 a small exploratory fleet of four ships and about 170 men left [[Lisbon]] under the command of [[Vasco da Gama]]. By December the fleet passed the [[Great Fish River]]—where Dias had turned back—and sailed into unknown waters. On 20 May 1498, they arrived at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]. The efforts of Vasco da Gama to get favourable trading conditions were hampered by the low value of their goods, compared with the valuable goods traded there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World|last=Bernstein|first=William J.|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=9780802144164|date=2008|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}} Two years and two days after departure, Gama and a survivor crew of 55 men returned in glory to Portugal as the first ships to sail directly from Europe to India.

In 1500, a second, larger fleet of thirteen ships and about 1500 men were sent to India. Under command of [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] they made a first landfall on the Brazilian coast; later, in the Indian Ocean, one of Cabral's ships reached [[Madagascar]] (1501), which was partly explored by [[Tristão da Cunha]] in 1507; [[Mauritius]] was discovered in 1507, [[Socotra]] occupied in 1506. In the same year [[Lourenço de Almeida]] landed in [[Sri Lanka]], the eastern island named "[[Names of Sri Lanka|Taprobane]]" in remote accounts of [[Alexander the Great]]'s and 4th-century BC Greek [[geographer]] [[Megasthenes]]. On the Asiatic mainland the first [[factory (trading post)|factories (trading-posts)]] were established at Kochi and Calicut (1501) and then [[Old Goa|Goa]] (1510).

===The "Spice Islands" and China===
[[File:Malaccaship.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Replica of ''[[Flor de la Mar]]'' [[carrack]] housing the Maritime Museum of [[Malacca]]]]

In 1511, [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquered [[Malacca]] for Portugal, then the centre of Asian trade. East of Malacca, Albuquerque sent several diplomatic missions: [[Duarte Fernandes]] as the first European envoy to the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] (modern [[Thailand]]).

Getting to know the secret location of the so-called "spice islands"—the [[Maluku Islands]], mainly the [[Banda Islands|Banda]], then the single world source of [[nutmeg]] and [[clove]]s, was the main purpose for the travels in the Indian sea—he sent an expedition led by [[António de Abreu]] to Banda (via [[Java]] and the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]), where they were the first Europeans to arrive in early 1512, after taking a route through which they also reached first the islands of [[Buru]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Seram]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Milton 1999|Milton 1999]], pp. 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Armando|last=Cortesão|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC&amp;lpg=PR81&amp;dq=Simao%20Afonso%20Bisagudo&amp;pg=PR81#v=onepage&amp;q=Simao%20Afonso%20Bisagudo&amp;f=false|title=The Suma Oriental of Tomé Pires: an account of the east, from the Red Sea to Japan, written in Malacca and India in 1512–1515/The Book of Francisco Rodrigues rutter of a voyage in the Red Sea, nautical rules, almanack and maps, written and drawn in the east before 1515|publisher=The [[Hakluyt Society]]|year=1944|accessdate=2016-02-10|isbn=9788120605350}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Banda Abreu returned to Malacca, while his vice-captain [[Francisco Serrão]], after a separation forced by a shipwreck and heading north, reached once again Ambon and sank off [[Ternate]], where he obtained a license to build a Portuguese fortress-factory: the Fort of São João Baptista de Ternate, which founded the Portuguese presence in the [[Malay Archipelago]].

In May 1513 [[Jorge Álvares]], one of the Portuguese envoys, reached China. Although he was the first to land on [[Nei Lingding Island|Lintin Island]] in the [[Pearl River Delta]], it was [[Rafael Perestrello]]—a cousin of the famed [[Christopher Columbus]]—who became the first European explorer to land on the southern coast of mainland China and trade in [[Guangzhou]] in 1516, commanding a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] vessel with a crew from a Malaysian junk that had sailed from [[Malacca]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pfoundes 1882|Pfoundes 1882]], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nowell 1947|Nowell 1947]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fernão Pires de Andrade]] visited Canton in 1517 and opened up trade with China. The Portuguese were defeated by the Chinese in 1521 at the [[Battle of Tunmen]] and in 1522 at the [[Battle of Xicaowan]], during which the Chinese captured Portuguese [[breech-loading swivel gun]]s and reverse engineered the technology, calling them "Folangji" 佛郎機 ([[Farangi|Frankish]]) guns, since the Portuguese were called "Folangji" by the Chinese. After a few decades, hostilities between the Portuguese and Chinese ceased and in 1557 the Chinese allowed the Portuguese to occupy [[Macau]].

To enforce a trade monopoly, [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], and [[Strait of Hormuz|Hormuz]] in the [[Persian Gulf]], were seized by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] in 1507 and in 1515, respectively. He also entered into [[Diplomacy|diplomatic relations]] with [[Iran|Persia]]. In 1513 while trying to conquer [[Aden]], an expedition led by Albuquerque cruised the [[Red Sea]] inside the [[Bab al-Mandab]], and sheltered at [[Kamaran]] island. In 1521, a force under [[António Correia (admiral)|António Correia]] conquered [[Bahrain]], ushering in a period of almost eighty years of Portuguese rule of the Gulf archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cole 2002|Cole 2002]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Red Sea, [[Massawa]] was the most northerly point frequented by the Portuguese until 1541, when a fleet under [[Estêvão da Gama (16th century)|Estevão da Gama]] penetrated as far as [[Suez]].

==Pacific Ocean (1513–1529)==
[[File:Balboa Voyage 1513.PNG|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]]'s travel to the "[[Pacific Ocean|South Sea]]", 1513]]

===Discovery of the Pacific Ocean===
In 1513, about {{convert|40|mi|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Acandí]], in present-day [[Colombia]], Spanish [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] heard unexpected news of an "other sea" rich in gold, which he received with great interest.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Otfinoski 2004|Otfinoski 2004]], p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; With few resources and using information given by ''[[cacique]]s'', he journeyed across the [[Isthmus of Panama]] with 190 Spaniards, a few native guides, and a pack of dogs.

Using a small [[brigantine]] and ten native [[canoe]]s, they sailed along the coast and made landfalls. On September 6, the expedition was reinforced with 1,000 men, fought several battles, entered a dense jungle and climbed the mountain range along the [[Chucunaque River]] from where this "other sea" could be seen. Balboa went ahead and, before noon September 25, he saw in the horizon an undiscovered sea, becoming the first European to have seen or reached the Pacific from the New World. The expedition descended towards the shore for a short reconnaissance trip, thus becoming the first Europeans to navigate the Pacific Ocean off the coast of the New World. After travelling more than {{convert|110|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, Balboa named the bay where they ended up [[Bay of San Miguel|''San Miguel'']]. He named the new sea [[Pacific Ocean|''Mar del Sur'' (South Sea)]], since they had travelled south to reach it. Balboa's main purpose in the expedition was the search for gold-rich kingdoms. To this end, he crossed through the lands of ''caciques'' to the islands, naming the largest one ''Isla Rica'' (Rich Island, today known as [[Isla del Rey (Panama)|Isla del Rey]]). He named the entire group ''[[Pearl Islands|Archipiélago de las Perlas]]'', which they still keep today.

===Subsequent developments to the east===
In 1515–1516, the Spanish fleet led by [[Juan Díaz de Solís]] sailed down the east coast of South America as far as [[Río de la Plata]], which Solís named shortly before he died, while trying to find a passage to the "South Sea".

At the same time, the Portuguese in Southeast Asia made the [[First Europeans in the Philippines|first European report on the western Pacific]], having identified [[Luzon]] east of [[Borneo]] and named its inhabitants the "[[Luções]]", in the modern [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lach 1998|Lach 1998]], p. 626&lt;/ref&gt;

===First circumnavigation===
[[File:Magellan's voyage EN.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|Route of [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]-[[Juan Sebastián Elcano|Elcano]] world circumnavigation (1519–1522)]]

By 1516 several Portuguese navigators, conflicting with King Manuel I of Portugal, had gathered in [[Seville]] to serve the newly crowned [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]]. Among them were explorers Diogo and [[Duarte Barbosa]], [[Estêvão Gomes]], [[João Serrão]] and [[Ferdinand Magellan]], cartographers [[Jorge Reinel]] and [[Diogo Ribeiro]], cosmographers Francisco and [[Rui Faleiro|Ruy Faleiro]] and the Flemish merchant [[Christopher de Haro]]. Ferdinand Magellan—who had sailed in India for Portugal up to 1513, when the [[Maluku Islands]] were reached, kept contact with [[Francisco Serrão]] living there&lt;ref&gt;[[#Zweig 1938|Zweig 1938]], p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donkin 2003|Donkin 2003]], p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;—developed the theory that the islands were in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas]] Spanish area, supported on studies by Faleiro brothers.

Aware of the efforts of the Spanish to find a route to India by sailing west, Magellan presented his plan to Charles I of Spain. The king and Christopher de Haro financed Magellan's expedition. A fleet was put together, and Spanish navigators such as [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] joined the enterprise. On August 10, 1519, they departed from Seville with a fleet of five ships—the [[flagship]] ''[[Trinidad (ship)|Trinidad]]'' under Magellan's command, ''San Antonio'', ''Concepcion'', ''Santiago'' and ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'', the first being a [[caravel]], and all others rated as [[carrack]]s or "naus"—with a crew of about 237 men from several nations, with the goal of reaching the Maluku Islands by travelling west, trying to reclaim it under Spain's economic and political sphere.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Detail from a map of Ortelius - Magellan's ship Victoria.png|thumb|upright=0.7|left|''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'', the single ship to have completed the first world [[circumnavigation]]. (Detail from ''[[Maris Pacifici]]'' by [[Ortelius]], 1589.)]]

The fleet sailed further and further south, avoiding the Portuguese territories in Brazil, and became the first to reach [[Tierra del Fuego]] at the tip of the Americas. On October 21, starting in [[Cape Virgenes]], they began an arduous trip through a 373-mile (600&amp;nbsp;km) long strait that Magellan named ''Estrecho de Todos los Santos'', the modern [[Strait of Magellan]]. On November 28, three ships entered the Pacific Ocean—then named ''Mar Pacífico'' because of its apparent stillness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Catholic Encyclopædia 2007|Catholic Encyclopædia 2007]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition managed to cross the Pacific. Magellan died in the [[battle of Mactan]] in the [[Philippines]], leaving the Spaniard [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] the task of completing the voyage, reaching the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] in 1521. On September 6, 1522 ''Victoria'' returned to Spain, thus completing the first [[circumnavigation]] of the globe. Of the men who set out on five ships, only 18 completed the circumnavigation and managed to return to Spain in this single vessel led by Elcano. Seventeen others arrived later in Spain: twelve captured by the Portuguese in Cape Verde some weeks earlier, and between 1525 and 1527, and five survivors of the ''Trinidad''. [[Antonio Pigafetta]], a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] scholar and traveller who had asked to be on board and become a strict assistant of Magellan, kept an accurate journal that become the main source for much of what we know about this voyage.

This round-the-world voyage gave Spain valuable knowledge of the world and its oceans which later helped in the exploration and settlement of the [[Philippines]]. Although this was not a realistic alternative to the Portuguese route around Africa&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fernandez-Armesto 2006|Fernandez-Armesto 2006]], p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[Strait of Magellan]] was too far south, and the Pacific Ocean too vast to cover in a single trip from Spain) successive Spanish expeditions used this information to explore the Pacific Ocean and discovered routes that [[Manila galleon|opened up trade]] between [[Acapulco]], [[New Spain]] (present-day [[Mexico]]) and [[Manila]] in the Philippines.

===Westward and eastward exploration meet===
[[File:Pulau Maitara and Pulau Tidore from the Floridas Restaurant in Pulau Ternate (Ternate Island), The Moluccas (Maluku) (15182126636).jpg|thumb|View from [[Ternate]] to [[Tidore]] islands in the [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], where Portuguese Eastward and Spanish Westward explorations ultimately met and clashed between 1522 and 1529&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[[#Newitt 2005|Newitt 2005]], p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lach 1998|Lach 1998]], p. 1397&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Saavedra-1527-1529.svg|thumb|Saavedra's failed attempts to find a return route from the Maluku to New Spain (Mexico) in 1529]]
Soon after Magellan's expedition, the Portuguese rushed to seize the surviving crew and built a fort in [[Ternate]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In 1525, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] sent another expedition westward to colonize the [[Maluku Islands]], claiming that they were in his zone of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]]. The fleet of seven ships and 450 men was led by [[García Jofre de Loaísa]] and included the most notable Spanish navigators: [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] and Loaísa, who lost their lives then, and the young [[Andrés de Urdaneta]].

Near the [[Strait of Magellan]] one of the ships was pushed south by a storm, reaching 56° S, where they thought seeing "''earth's end''": so [[Cape Horn]] was crossed for the first time. The expedition reached the islands with great difficulty, docking at [[Tidore]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The conflict with the Portuguese established in nearby Ternate was inevitable, starting nearly a decade of skirmishes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lach 1998|Lach 1998]], p. 1397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;

As there was not a set eastern limit to the Tordesillas line, both kingdoms organized meetings to resolve the issue. From 1524 to 1529 Portuguese and Spanish experts met at Badajoz-Elvas trying to find the exact location of the [[antimeridian]] of Tordesillas, which would divide the world into two equal hemispheres. Each crown appointed three [[astronomy|astronomers]] and [[cartography|cartographers]], three [[navigation|pilots]] and three mathematicians. [[Lopo Homem]], Portuguese cartographer and cosmographer was in the board, along with cartographer [[Diogo Ribeiro]] on the Spanish delegation. The board met several times, without reaching an agreement: the knowledge at that time was insufficient for an [[History of longitude|accurate calculation of longitude]], and each group gave the islands to its sovereign. The issue was settled only in 1529, after a long negotiation, with the signing of [[Treaty of Zaragoza]], that attributed the Maluku Islands to Portugal and the [[Philippines]] to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 368, 473.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1525 and 1528 Portugal sent several expeditions around the Maluku Islands. [[Gomes de Sequeira]] and Diogo da Rocha were sent north by the governor of Ternate [[Jorge de Menezes]], being the first Europeans to reach the [[Caroline Islands]], which they named "Islands de Sequeira".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Galvano 1563|Galvano 1563]], p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; In 1526, Jorge de Meneses docked on [[Biak]] and [[Waigeo]] islands, Papua New Guinea. Based on these explorations stands the [[theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia]], one among several competing theories about the early discovery of Australia, supported by Australian historian [[Kenneth McIntyre]], stating it was discovered by [[Cristóvão de Mendonça]] and Gomes de Sequeira.

In 1527 [[Hernán Cortés]] fitted out a fleet to find new lands in the "South Sea" (Pacific Ocean), asking his cousin [[Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón]] to take charge. On October 31 of 1527 Saavedra sailed from [[New Spain]], crossing the Pacific and touring the north of [[New Guinea]], then named ''Isla de Oro''. In October 1528 one of the vessels reached the Maluku Islands. In his attempt to return to New Spain he was diverted by the northeast [[trade wind]]s, which threw him back, so he tried sailing back down, to the south. He returned to New Guinea and sailed northeast, where he sighted the [[Marshall Islands]] and the [[Admiralty Islands]], but again was surprised by the winds, which brought him a third time to the Moluccas. This westbound return route was hard to find, but was eventually discovered by [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] in 1565.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fernandez-Armesto 2006|Fernandez-Armesto 2006]], p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inland Spanish ''conquistadores'' (1519–1532)==
Rumours of undiscovered islands northwest of [[Hispaniola]] had reached Spain by 1511 and king [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] was interested in forestalling further exploration. While Portuguese were making huge gains in the Indian Ocean, the Spanish invested in exploring inland in search of gold and valuable resources. The members of these expeditions, the "[[conquistadors]]", came from a variety of backgrounds including artisans, merchants, clergy, lesser nobility and freed slaves. They usually supplied their own equipment in exchange for a share in profits, having no direct connection with the royal army, and often no professional military training or experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[#U.C. 2009|U.C. 2009]], web&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Americas the Spanish found a number of empires that were as large and populous as those in Europe. However, small bodies of ''conquistadors'', with large armies of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous Americans]] groups, managed to conquer these states. During this time, [[pandemic]]s of European disease such as [[smallpox]] devastated the indigenous populations. Once Spanish [[sovereignty]] was established, the Spanish focused on the extraction and export of gold and silver.

In 1512, to reward [[Juan Ponce de León]] for exploring [[Puerto Rico]] in 1508, king Ferdinand urged him to seek these new lands. He would become governor of discovered lands, but was to finance himself all exploration.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lawson 2007|Lawson 2007]], pp. 84–88.&lt;/ref&gt; With three ships and about 200 men, Léon set out from Puerto Rico in March 1513. In April they sighted land and named it ''[[Florida|La Florida]]''—because it was [[Easter]] (Florida) season—believing it was an island, becoming credited as the first European to land in the continent. The arrival location has been disputed between [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lawson 2007|Lawson 2007]], pp. 29–32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ponce de León Inlet]] and [[Melbourne Beach, Florida|Melbourne Beach]]. They headed south for further exploration and on April 8 encountered a current so strong that it pushed them backwards: this was the first encounter with the [[Gulf Stream]] that would soon become the primary route for eastbound ships leaving the Spanish Indies bound for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Weddle 1985|Weddle 1985]], p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; They explored down the coast reaching [[Biscayne Bay]], [[Dry Tortugas]] and then sailing southwest in an attempt to circle [[Cuba]] to return, reaching [[Grand Bahama]] on July.

===Cortés' Mexico and the Aztec Empire===
{{main|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire}}
{{See also|Spanish conquest of Yucatán|Spanish conquest of Guatemala}}
[[File:Ruta de Cortés.svg|thumb|Route of Cortés inland progress 1519–1521]]
In 1517 [[Cuba]]'s governor [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]] commissioned a fleet under the command of [[Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (Yucatán conquistador)|Hernández de Córdoba]] to explore the [[Yucatán peninsula]]. They reached the coast where [[Mayans]] invited them to land, but were attacked at night and only a remnant of the crew returned. Velázquez then commissioned another expedition led by his nephew [[Juan de Grijalva]], who sailed south along the coast to [[Tabasco]], part of the Aztec empire. In 1518 Velázquez gave the mayor of the capital of Cuba, [[Hernán Cortés]], the command of an expedition to secure the interior of Mexico but, due to an old gripe between them, revoked the charter.

In February 1519 Cortés went ahead anyway, in an act of open mutiny. With about 11 ships, 500 men, 13 horses and a small number of cannons he landed in Yucatán, in [[Mayan civilization|Mayan]] territory,&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"&gt;[[#Grunberg 2007|Grunberg 2007]], magazine&lt;/ref&gt; claiming the land for the Spanish crown. From [[Trinidad]] he proceeded to [[Tabasco]] and won a battle against the natives. Among the vanquished was [[La Malinche]], his future mistress, who knew both (Aztec) [[Nahuatl language]] and Maya, becoming a valuable interpreter and counsellor. Through her, Cortés learned about the wealthy [[Aztec Empire]].

In July his men took over [[Veracruz]] and he placed himself under direct orders of new king [[Charles I of Spain]].&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; There Cortés asked for a meeting with Aztec Emperor [[Montezuma II]], who repeatedly refused. They headed to [[Tenochtitlan]] and on the way made alliances with several tribes. In October, accompanied by about 3,000 [[Tlaxcaltec]] they marched to [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], the second largest city in central Mexico. Either to instill fear upon the Aztecs waiting for him or (as he later claimed) wishing to make an example when he feared native treachery, they massacred thousands of unarmed members of the nobility gathered at the central plaza and partially burned the city.
[[File:Tenochtitlan y Golfo de Mexico 1524.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the island city [[Tenochtitlán]] and Mexico gulf made by one of Cortés' men, 1524, [[Newberry Library]], Chicago]]
Arriving in Tenochtitlan with a large army, on November 8 they were peacefully received by Moctezuma II, who deliberately let Cortés enter the heart of the Aztec Empire, hoping to know them better to crush them later.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; The emperor gave them lavish gifts in gold which enticed them to plunder vast amounts. In his letters to King Charles, Cortés claimed to have learned then that he was considered by the Aztecs to be either an emissary of the feathered serpent god [[Quetzalcoatl]] or Quetzalcoatl himself—a belief contested by a few modern historians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Restall 2004|Restall 2004]], pp. 659–87.&lt;/ref&gt; But he soon learned that his men on the coast had been attacked, and decided to hostage Moctezuma in his palace, demanding a ransom as tribute to King Charles.

Meanwhile, Velasquez sent another expedition, led by [[Pánfilo de Narváez]], to oppose Cortès, arriving in Mexico in April 1520 with 1,100 men.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; Cortés left 200 men in Tenochtitlan and took the rest to confront Narvaez, whom he overcame, convincing his men to join him. In Tenochtitlán one of Cortés's lieutenants committed a [[massacre in the Great Temple]], triggering local rebellion. Cortés speedily returned, attempting the support of Moctezuma but the Aztec emperor was killed, possibly stoned by his subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Castillo 1963|Castillo 1963]], p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish fled for the Tlaxcaltec during the ''[[La Noche Triste|Noche Triste]]'', where they managed a narrow escape while their back guard was massacred. Much of the treasure looted was lost during this panicked escape.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; After [[Battle of Otumba|a battle in Otumba]] they reached Tlaxcala, having lost 870 men.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; Having prevailed with the assistance of allies and reinforcements from [[Cuba]], Cortés [[Fall of Tenochtitlan|besieged Tenochtitlán]] and captured its ruler [[Cuauhtémoc]] in August 1521. As the Aztec Empire ended he claimed the city for Spain, renaming it Mexico City.

===Pizarro's Peru and the Inca Empire===
[[File:Conquest peru 1531 edited.png|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Francisco Pizarro]]'s route of exploration during the conquest of [[Peru]] (1531–1533)]]

A first attempt to explore western South America was undertaken in 1522 by [[Pascual de Andagoya]]. Native South Americans told him about a gold-rich territory on a river called Pirú. Having reached [[San Juan River (Colombia)]], Andagoya fell ill and returned to [[Panama]], where he spread news about "Pirú" as the legendary [[El Dorado]]. These, along with the accounts of success of [[Hernán Cortés]], caught the attention of Pizarro.

[[Francisco Pizarro]] had accompanied [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa|Balboa]] in the crossing of the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. In 1524 he formed a partnership with priest [[Hernando de Luque]] and soldier [[Diego de Almagro]] to explore the south, agreeing to divide the profits. They dubbed the enterprise the "''Empresa del Levante''": Pizarro would command, Almagro would provide military and food supplies, and Luque would be in charge of finances and additional provisions.

On 13 September 1524, the first of three expeditions left to conquer [[Peru]] with about 80 men and 40 horses. The expedition was a failure, reaching no farther than Colombia before succumbing to bad weather, hunger and skirmishes with hostile locals, where Almagro lost an eye. The place names bestowed along their route, ''Puerto deseado'' (desired port), ''Puerto del hambre'' (port of hunger) and ''Puerto quemado'' (burned port), attest to the difficulties of their journey. Two years later they began a second expedition with reluctant permission from the Governor of Panama. In August 1526, they left with two ships, 160 men and several horses. Upon reaching San Juan River they separated, Pizarro staying to explore the swampy coasts and Almagro sent back for reinforcements. Pizarro's main pilot sailed south and, after crossing the equator, captured a raft from [[Tumbes Region|Tumbes]]. To his surprise, it carried textiles, ceramic and much-desired gold, silver, and emeralds, becoming the central focus of the expedition. Soon Almagro joined with reinforcements and they resumed. After a difficult voyage facing strong winds and currents, they reached [[Atacames]] where they found a large native population under [[Inca]] rule, but they did not land.

Pizarro remained safe near the coast, while Almagro and Luque went back for reinforcements with proof of the [[El Dorado|rumoured gold]]. The new governor outright rejected a third expedition and ordered two ships to bring everyone back to Panama. Almagro and Luque grasped the opportunity to join Pizarro. When they arrived at the ''Isla de Gallo'', Pizarro drew a line in the sand, saying: ''"There lies Peru with its riches; Here, Panama and its poverty. Choose, each man, what best becomes a brave Castilian."'' Thirteen men decided to stay and became known as ''The Famous Thirteen''. They headed for ''La Isla Gorgona'', where they remained for seven months before the arrival of provisions.

They decided to sail south and, by April 1528, reached the northwestern Peruvian [[Tumbes Region]] and were warmly received by local ''Tumpis''. Two of Pizarro's men reported incredible riches, including gold and silver decorations around the chief's house. They saw for the first time a [[llama]] which Pizarro called "little camels". The natives named the Spanish "Children of the Sun" for their fair complexion and brilliant armours. They decided then to return to Panama to prepare a final expedition. Before leaving they sailed south through territories they named such as Cabo Blanco, port of Payta, Sechura, Punta de Aguja, Santa Cruz, and [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], reaching the ninth degree south.

In the spring of 1528 Pizarro sailed for Spain, where he had an interview with king [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]]. The king heard of his expeditions in lands rich in gold and silver and promised to support him. The ''Capitulación de Toledo''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cervantes web|Cervantes web]], original text.&lt;/ref&gt; authorized Pizarro to proceed with the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]]. Pizarro was then able to convince many friends and relatives to join: his brothers [[Hernándo Pizarro]], [[Juan Pizarro (conquistador)|Juan Pizarro]], [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] and also [[Francisco de Orellana]], who would later explore the [[Amazon River]], as well as his cousin [[Pedro Pizarro]].

Pizarro's third and final expedition left Panama for Peru on 27 December 1530. With three ships and one hundred and eighty men they landed near Ecuador and sailed to Tumbes, finding the place destroyed. They entered the interior and established the first Spanish settlement in [[Peru]], [[San Miguel de Piura]]. One of the men returned with an Incan envoy and an invitation for a meeting. Since the last meeting, the Inca had begun a [[Inca Civil War|civil war]] and [[Atahualpa]] had been resting in northern Peru following the defeat of his brother [[Huáscar]]. After marching for two months, they approached Atahualpa. He refused the Spanish, however, saying he would "be no man's tributary." There were fewer than 200 Spanish to his 80,000 soldiers, but Pizarro attacked and won the Incan army in the [[Battle of Cajamarca]], taking Atahualpa captive at the so-called [[The Ransom Room|ransom room]]. Despite fulfilling his promise of filling one room with gold and two with silver, he was convicted for killing his brother and plotting against Pizarro, and was executed.

In 1533, Pizarro invaded [[Cusco|Cuzco]] with indigenous troops and wrote to King Charles I: "''This city is the greatest and the finest ever seen in this country or anywhere in the Indies&amp;nbsp;... it is so beautiful and has such fine buildings that it would be remarkable even in Spain.''" After the Spanish had sealed the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]], [[Jauja]] in fertile [[Mantaro Valley]] was established as Peru's provisional capital, but it was too far up in the mountains, and Pizarro founded the city of [[Lima]] on 18 January 1535, which Pizarro considered one of the most important acts in his life.

==New trade routes (1542–1565)==
[[File:16th century Portuguese Spanish trade routes.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] trade routes (blue) and the rival [[Manila galleon|Manila-Acapulco galleons]] trade routes (white) established in 1568]]

In 1543 three Portuguese traders accidentally became the first Westerners to reach and trade with Japan. According to [[Fernão Mendes Pinto]], who claimed to be in this journey, they arrived at [[Tanegashima]], where the locals were impressed by [[Firearms of Japan|firearms]] that would be immediately made by the Japanese on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pacey 1991|Pacey 1991]], p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish conquest of the [[Philippines]] was ordered by [[Philip II of Spain]], and [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] was the designated commander. Urdaneta agreed to accompany the expedition but refused to command and [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] was appointed instead. The expedition set sail on November 1564.&lt;ref&gt;N. McAlister, Lyle. (1984) ''Spain and Portugal in the New World: 1492–1700.'' p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; After spending some time on the islands, Legazpi sent Urdaneta back to find a better return route. Urdaneta set sail from San Miguel on the island of [[Cebu]] on June 1, 1565, but was obliged to sail as far as [[38th parallel north|38 degrees North latitude]] to obtain favourable winds.
[[File:Namban-11.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Portuguese [[carrack]] in [[Nagasaki]], [[Nanban trade|Nanban art]] attributed to [[Kanō Naizen]], 1570–1616 Japan]]

He reasoned that the [[trade wind]]s of the Pacific might move in a [[gyre]] as the Atlantic winds did. If in the Atlantic, ships made the ''[[Volta do mar]]'' to pick up winds that would bring them back from Madeira, then, he reasoned, by sailing far to the north before heading east, he would pick up trade winds to bring him back to North America. His hunch paid off, and he hit the coast near [[Cape Mendocino]], California, then followed the coast south. The ship reached the port of Acapulco, on October 8, 1565, having travelled {{convert|12000|mi|0|abbr=off}} in 130 days. Fourteen of his crew died; only Urdaneta and Felipe de Salcedo, nephew of López de Legazpi, had strength enough to cast the anchors.

Thus, a cross-Pacific Spanish route was established, between Mexico and the Philippines. For a long time these routes were used by the [[Manila galleon]]s, thereby creating a trade link joining China, the Americas, and Europe via the combined trans-Pacific and [[Transatlantic crossing|trans-Atlantic]] routes.

==Northern European involvement (1595 – 17th century)==
[[File:OrteliusWorldMap1570.jpg|thumb|In 1570 (May 20) Gilles Coppens de Diest at [[Antwerp]] published 53 maps created by [[Abraham Ortelius]] under the title ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'', considered the "first modern atlas". Three Latin editions of this (besides a Dutch, a French and a German edition) appeared before the end of 1572; the atlas continued to be in demand till about 1612. This is the world map from this atlas.]]

Nations outside Iberia refused to acknowledge the Treaty of Tordesillas. France, the Netherlands and [[Kingdom of England|England]] each had a long [[Maritime history of Europe|maritime tradition]] and had been engaging in [[privateer]]ing. Despite Iberian protections, the new technologies and maps soon made their way north.

In 1568 the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] rebelled against the rule of [[Philip II of Spain]] leading to the [[Eighty Years' War]]. War between England and Spain also broke out. In 1580 Philip II became King of Portugal, as heir to the Crown. The combined empires were simply too big to go unchallenged by European rivals.

Philip's troops conquered the important trading cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]]. [[Antwerp]], then the most important port in the world, fell in 1585. The Protestant population was given two years to settle affairs before leaving the city.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1977|Boxer 1977]], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Many settled in [[Amsterdam]]. Those were mainly skilled craftsmen, rich merchants of the port cities and refugees that fled religious persecution, particularly [[Sephardi Jews]] from Portugal and Spain and, later, the [[Huguenot]]s from France. The [[Pilgrim Fathers]] also spent time there before going to the New World. This mass immigration was an important driving force: a small port in 1585, Amsterdam quickly transformed into one of the most important commercial centres in the world. After the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 there was a huge expansion of maritime trade even though the defeat of the [[English Armada]] would confirm the naval supremacy of the Spanish navy over the emergent competitors.

The emergence of Dutch maritime power was swift and remarkable: for years Dutch sailors had participated in Portuguese voyages to the east, as able seafarers and keen mapmakers. In 1592, [[Cornelis de Houtman]] was sent by Dutch merchants to Lisbon, to gather as much information as he could about the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]. In 1595, merchant and explorer [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], having travelled widely in the Indian Ocean at the service of the Portuguese, published a travel report in Amsterdam, the ''"Reys-gheschrift vande navigatien der Portugaloysers in Orienten"'' (''"Report of a journey through the navigations of the Portuguese in the East"'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#Linschoten 1598|Linschoten 1598]], original book&lt;/ref&gt; This included vast directions on how to navigate between Portugal and the East Indies and to Japan. That same year Houtman followed this directions in the Dutch first exploratory travel that discovered a new sea route, sailing directly from Madagascar to [[Sunda Strait]] in Indonesia and signing a treaty with the [[Banten]] Sultan.

Dutch and British interest, fed on new information, led to a movement of commercial expansion, and the foundation of English (1600), and Dutch (1602) [[chartered companies]]. Dutch, French, and English sent ships which flouted the Portuguese monopoly, concentrated mostly on the coastal areas, which proved unable to defend against such a vast and dispersed venture.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1969|Boxer 1969]], p 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploring North America===
[[File:Henry Hudson Map 26.png|thumb|right|Map of [[Henry Hudson]]'s 1609–1611 voyages to North America for the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC)]]

The 1497 English expedition led by Italian Venetian [[John Cabot]] (Giovanni Caboto) was the first of a series of French and English missions exploring North America. Spain put limited efforts into exploring the northern part of the Americas, as its resources were concentrated in Central and South America where more wealth had been found.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[#Paine 2000|Paine 2000]], p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; These expeditions were hoping to find an oceanic [[Northwest Passage]] to Asian trade.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This was never discovered, but other possibilities were found, and in the early 17th century colonists from a number of Northern European states began to settle on the east coast of North America. In 1520–1521 the Portuguese [[João Álvares Fagundes]], accompanied by couples of mainland Portugal and the Azores, explored Newfoundland and [[Nova Scotia]] (possibly reaching the [[Bay of Fundy]] on the [[Minas Basin]]&lt;ref&gt;Mount Allison University, ''[http://www.mta.ca/marshland/topic3_europeans/european.htm Marshlands: Records of Life on the Tantramar: European Contact and Mapping]'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt;), and established a fishing colony on the [[Cape Breton Island]], that would last until at least the 1570s or near the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;''Tratado das ilhas novas e descombrimento dellas e outras couzas, 1570'' Francisco de Souza, p. 6 [https://books.google.com/books/about/Tratado_das_ilhas_novas_e_descombrimento.html?id=3WMDAAAAQAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1524, Italian [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] sailed at the behest of [[Francis I of France]], who was motivated by indignation over the division of the world between Portuguese and Spanish. Verrazzano explored the Atlantic Coast of North America, from [[South Carolina]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and was the first recorded European to visit what would later become the [[Virginia Colony]] and the United States. In the same year [[Esteban Gómez|Estevão Gomes]], a Portuguese [[cartography|cartographer]] who had sailed in Ferdinand Magellan's fleet, explored [[Nova Scotia]], sailing South through [[Maine]], where he entered [[New York Harbor]], the [[Hudson River]] and eventually reached [[Florida]] in August 1525. As a result of his expedition, the 1529 [[Diogo Ribeiro]] world map outlines the East coast of North America almost perfectly. From 1534 to 1536, French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]], believed to have accompanied Verrazzano to Nova Scotia and Brazil, was the first European to travel inland in North America, describing the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], which he [[Name of Canada|named "The Country of Canadas]]", after [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquois names]], claiming what is now Canada for Francis I of France.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cartier E.B. 2009|Cartier E.B. 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#histori.ca 2009|Histori.ca 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Half Moon in Hudson.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Hudson's ship ''[[Halve Maen]]'' in the [[Hudson River]]]]

Europeans explored the Pacific Coast beginning in the mid-16th century. [[Francisco de Ulloa]] explored the Pacific coast of present-day Mexico including the [[Gulf of California]], proving that [[Baja California]] was a peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gutierrez 1998|Gutierrez 1998]]. pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his discoveries, the myth persisted in Europe that California was an [[Island of California|island]]. His account provided the first recorded use of the name "California". [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo|João Rodrigues Cabrilho]], a Portuguese navigator sailing for the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Crown]], was the first European to set foot in California, landing on September 28, 1542 on the shores of [[San Diego Bay]] and claiming California for Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#San Diego HS|San Diego HS]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; He also landed on [[San Miguel Island|San Miguel]], one of the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]], and continued as far as [[Point Reyes]]. After his death the crew continued exploring as far north as [[Oregon]].

The English naval commander [[Francis Drake]] sailed along the coast in 1579 somewhere north of Cabrillo's landing site—the actual location of Drake's landing was secret and is still undetermined
&lt;ref&gt;Sir Francis Drake Association | http://www.SirFrancisDrakeAssociation.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Drake N.Guild|Drake N.Guild]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;—and claimed the land for England,&lt;ref&gt;Edward Wright's World Chart 1599 documents a Land Claim | http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1179/0082288414Z.00000000027&lt;/ref&gt; calling it [[New Albion|Nova Albion]]. The term "Nova Albion" was therefore used on many European maps to designate territory north of the Spanish settlements.&lt;ref&gt;[[#USF 2010|USF 2010]], web&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1609 and 1611, after several voyages on behalf of English merchants to explore a prospective [[Northern Sea Route|Northeast Passage]] to India, Kingdom of England's [[Henry Hudson]], under the auspices of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), explored the region around present-day New York City, while looking for a western route to Asia. He explored the [[Hudson River]] and laid the foundation for [[New Netherland|Dutch colonization]] of the region. Hudson's final expedition ranged farther north in search of the [[Northwest Passage]], leading to his discovery of the [[Hudson Strait]] and [[Hudson Bay]]. After wintering in the [[James Bay]], Hudson tried to press on with his voyage in the spring of 1611, but his crew mutinied and they [[marooning|cast him adrift]].

===Search for a northern route===
[[File:Barentsz Full Map.jpg|thumb|1599 map of Arctic exploration by [[Willem Barentsz]] in his third voyage]]

France, the Netherlands, and England were left without a sea route to Asia, either via Africa or South America. When it became apparent that there was no route through the heart of the Americas, attention turned to the possibility of a passage through northern waters, which English called the [[Northwest Passage]]. The desire to establish such a route motivated much of the European exploration of both coasts of North America and in Russia. In Russia the idea of a possible seaway connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific was first put forward by the diplomat [[Dmitry Gerasimov|Gerasimov]] in 1525, although Russian settlers on the coast of the [[White Sea]], the [[Pomor]]s, had been exploring parts of the route as early as the 11th century.

In 1553 English explorer [[Hugh Willoughby]] with chief pilot [[Richard Chancellor]] were sent out with three vessels in search of a passage by London's [[Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands]]. During the voyage across the [[Barents Sea]], Willoughby thought he saw islands to the north, and islands called [[Willoughby's Land]] were shown on maps published by [[Petrus Plancius|Plancius]] and [[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]] into the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hacquebord 1995|Hacquebord 1995]],&lt;/ref&gt; The vessels were separated by "terrible whirlwinds" in the [[Norwegian Sea]] and Willoughby sailed into a bay near the present border between Finland and Russia. His ships with the frozen crews, including Captain Willoughby and his journal, were found by Russian fishermen a year later. [[Richard Chancellor]] was able to drop anchor in the [[White Sea]] and trudge his way overland to Moscow and [[Ivan the Terrible]]'s Court, opening trade with Russia and the Company of Merchant Adventurers became the [[Muscovy Company]].

====Barentsz' Arctic exploration====
5 June 1594, Dutch [[cartographer]] [[Willem Barentsz]] departed from [[Texel]] in a fleet of three ships to enter the [[Kara Sea]], with the hopes of finding the [[Northeast Passage]] above [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Synge 1912|Synge 1912]], p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; At Williams Island the crew encountered a [[polar bear]] for the first time. They managed to bring it on board, but the bear rampaged and was killed. Barentsz reached the west coast of [[Novaya Zemlya]] and followed it northward, before being forced to turn back in the face of large [[iceberg]]s.

The following year, [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurice of Orange]] named him chief pilot of a new expedition of six ships, loaded with merchant wares that the Dutch hoped to trade with China.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ULT 2009|ULT 2009]], web&lt;/ref&gt; The party came across [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyed]] "wild men" but eventually turned back upon discovering the [[Kara Sea]] frozen. In 1596, the States-General offered a high reward for anybody who ''successfully'' navigated the [[Northeast Passage]]. The Town Council of [[Amsterdam]] purchased and outfitted two small ships, captained by [[Jan Rijp]] and [[Jacob van Heemskerk]], to search for the elusive channel, under the command of Barents. They set off on May, and on June discovered [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]] and [[Spitsbergen]], sighting its northwest coast. They saw a large bay, later called [[Raudfjorden]] and entered [[Magdalenefjorden]], which they named ''Tusk Bay'', sailing into the northern entrance of [[Forlandsundet]], which they called ''Keerwyck'', but were forced to turn back because of a shoal. On 28 June they rounded the northern point of [[Prins Karls Forland]], which they named ''Vogelhoek'', on account of the large number of birds, and sailed south, passing [[Isfjorden (Svalbard)|Isfjorden]] and [[Bellsund]], which were labelled on Barentsz's chart as ''Grooten Inwyck'' and ''Inwyck''.

[[File:Polar bear, Gerrit de Veer (1596).jpg|thumb|left|Crew of Willem Barentsz fighting a [[polar bear]]]]

The ships once again reached Bear Island on 1 July, which led to a disagreement. They parted ways, with Barentsz continuing northeast, while Rijp headed north. Barentsz reached [[Novaya Zemlya]] and, to avoid becoming entrapped in ice, headed for the [[Vaigatch Strait]] but became stuck within the icebergs and floes. Stranded, the 16-man crew was forced to spend the winter on the ice. The crew used lumber from their ship to build a lodge they called ''Het Behouden Huys'' (The Kept House). Dealing with extreme cold, they used the merchant fabrics to make additional blankets and clothing and caught [[Arctic fox]]es in primitive traps, as well as polar bears. When June arrived, and the ice had still not loosened its grip on the ship, [[scurvy]]-ridden survivors took two small boats out into the sea. Barentsz died at sea on 20 June 1597, while studying charts. It took seven more weeks for the boats to reach [[Kola (town)|Kola]] where they were rescued by a Russian merchant vessel. Only 12 crewmen remained, reaching Amsterdam in November. Two of Barentsz' crewmembers later published their journals, [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], who had accompanied him on the first two voyages, and [[Gerrit de Veer]] who had acted as the ship's carpenter on the last.

In 1608, [[Henry Hudson]] made a second attempt, trying to go across the top of Russia. He made it to [[Novaya Zemlya]] but was forced to turn back. Between 1609 and 1611, Hudson, after several voyages on behalf of English merchants to explore a prospective Northern Sea Route to India, explored the region around modern New York City while looking for a western route to Asia under the auspices of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC).

===Dutch Australia and New Zealand===
[[File:Tasmanroutes.PNG|thumb|The route of [[Abel Tasman]]'s 1642 and 1644 voyages in [[New Holland (Australia)]] in the service of the VOC ([[Dutch East India Company]])]]

''[[Terra Australis|Terra Australis Ignota]]'' (Latin, "the unknown land of the south") was a hypothetical continent appearing on European maps from the 15th to the 18th centuries, with roots in a notion introduced by [[Aristotle]]. It was depicted on the mid-16th-century [[Dieppe maps]], where its coastline appeared just south of the islands of the East Indies; it was often elaborately charted, with a wealth of fictitious detail. The discoveries reduced the area where the continent could be found; however, many cartographers held to Aristotle's opinion, like [[Gerardus Mercator]] (1569) and [[Alexander Dalrymple]] even so late as 1767&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilford 1982|Wilford 1982]], p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; argued for its existence, with such arguments as that there should be a large landmass in the Southern Hemisphere as a counterweight to the known landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere. As new lands were discovered, they were often assumed to be parts of this hypothetical continent.

[[Juan Fernández (explorer)|Juan Fernandez]], sailing from Chile in 1576, claimed he had discovered the Southern Continent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Medina 1918|Medina 1918]], pp. 136–246.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luís Vaz de Torres|Luis Váez de Torres]], a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]n navigator working for the Spanish Crown, proved the existence of a passage south of New Guinea, now known as [[Torres Strait]]. [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]], a Portuguese navigator sailing for the Spanish Crown, saw a large island south of New Guinea in 1606, which he named La Australia del [[Espiritu Santo]]. He represented this to the King of Spain as the Terra Australis incognita. In fact, it was not Australia but an island in present-day [[Vanuatu]].
[[File:Duyfken replica, Swan River.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Duyfken]]'' replica, Swan River, Australia]]
[[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] navigator and colonial governor, [[Willem Janszoon]] sailed from the Netherlands for the East Indies for the third time on December 18, 1603, as captain of the ''[[Duyfken]]'' (or ''Duijfken'', meaning "Little Dove"), one of twelve ships of the great fleet of [[Steven van der Hagen]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mutch 1942|Mutch 1942]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Once in the Indies, Janszoon was sent to search for other outlets of trade, particularly in "the great land of Nova Guinea and other East and Southlands." On November 18, 1605, the ''Duyfken'' sailed from [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] to the coast of western [[New Guinea]]. Janszoon then crossed the eastern end of the [[Arafura Sea]], without seeing the [[Torres Strait]], into the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. On February 26, 1606, he made landfall at the [[Pennefather River]] on the western shore of [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] in Queensland, near the modern town of [[Weipa, Queensland|Weipa]]. This is the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent. Janszoon proceeded to chart some {{convert|320|km|0|abbr=off}} of the coastline, which he thought was a southerly extension of New Guinea. In 1615, [[Jacob Le Maire|Jacob le Maire]] and [[Willem Schouten]]'s rounding of Cape Horn proved that [[Tierra del Fuego]] was a relatively small island.

In 1642–1644 [[Abel Tasman]], also a Dutch explorer and [[merchant]] in the service of the VOC, circumnavigated [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] proving that Australia was not part of the mythical southern continent. He was the first known European [[Exploration|expedition]] to reach the islands of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (now [[Tasmania]]) and [[New Zealand]] and to sight the [[Fiji]] islands, which he did in 1643. Tasman, his navigator Visscher, and his merchant Gilsemans also mapped substantial portions of Australia, New Zealand and the [[Pacific Islands]].

==Russian exploration of Siberia (1581–1660)==
{{Main|Russian conquest of Siberia|Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir|Siberian River Routes|List of Russian explorers}}
[[File:Siberiariverroutemap.png|right|thumb|[[Siberian river routes]] were of primary significance in the process of exploration.]]
In the mid-16th century the [[Tsardom of Russia]] conquered the Tatar khanates of [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]], thus annexing the entire [[Volga Region]] and opening the way to the [[Ural Mountains]]. The colonization of the new easternmost lands of Russia and further onslaught eastward was led by the rich merchants [[Stroganov]]s. Tsar [[Ivan IV]] granted vast estates near the Urals as well as tax privileges to [[Anikey Stroganov]], who organized large scale migration to these lands. Stroganovs developed farming, hunting, saltworks, fishing, and ore mining on the Urals and established trade with [[Siberia]]n tribes.

===Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir===
Around 1577, [[Semyon Stroganov]] and other sons of Anikey Stroganov hired a [[Cossack]] leader called [[Yermak]] to protect their lands from the attacks of [[Siberian Khanate|Siberian Khan]] [[Kuchum]]. By 1580 Stroganovs and Yermak came up with the idea of the military expedition to Siberia, in order to fight Kuchum in his own land. In 1581 Yermak began his voyage into the depths of [[Siberia]]. After a few victories over the khan's army, Yermak's people defeated the main forces of Kuchum on [[Irtysh River]] in a 3-day [[Battle of Chuvash Cape]] in 1582. The remains of the khan's army retreated to the [[steppe]]s, and thus Yermak captured the [[Siberia Khanate]], including its capital [[Qashliq]] near modern [[Tobolsk]]. Kuchum still was strong and suddenly attacked Yermak in 1585 in the dead of night, killing most of his people. Yermak was wounded and tried to swim across the Wagay River ([[Irtysh]]'s tributary), but drowned under the weight of his own [[Mail (armour)|chain mail]]. The Cossacks had to withdraw from Siberia completely, but thanks to Yermak's having explored all the main river routes in West Siberia, Russians successfully reclaimed all his conquests just several years later.
[[File:Yermak Timofeyevich and his band of adventurers crossing the Ural Mountains at Tagil, entering Asia from Europe.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yermak Timofeyevich]] and his band of adventurers crossing the [[Ural Mountains]] at Tagil, entering Asia from Europe]]

===Siberian river routes===
In the early 17th century the eastward movement of Russians was slowed by the internal problems in the country during the [[Time of Troubles]]. However, very soon the exploration and colonization of the huge territories of Siberia was resumed, led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable [[furs]] and [[ivory]]. While [[Cossacks]] came from the Southern Urals, another wave of Russians came by the Arctic Ocean. These were [[Pomors]] from the [[Northwest Russia|Russian North]], who already had been making [[fur]] trade with [[Mangazeya]] in the north of the Western Siberia for quite a long time. In 1607 the settlement of [[Turukhansk]] was founded on the northern [[Yenisei River]], near the mouth of [[Lower Tunguska]], and in 1619 [[Yeniseysk]]y [[ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]] was founded on the mid-Yenisei at the mouth of the [[Upper Tunguska]].

Between 1620 and 1624 a group of fur hunters led by [[Demid Pyanda]] left [[Turukhansk]] and explored some {{convert|1430|mi|0|abbr=off}} of the Lower Tunguska, wintering in the proximity of the [[Vilyuy]] and [[Lena River|Lena]] rivers. According to later legendary accounts (folktales collected a century after the fact), Pyanda discovered the Lena River. He allegedly explored some {{convert|1500|mi|0|abbr=off}} of its length, reaching as far as central [[Yakutia]]. He returned up the Lena until it became too rocky and shallow, and portaged to the [[Angara River]]. In this way, Pyanda may have become the first Russian to meet [[Yakuts]] and [[Buryats]]. He built new boats and explored some {{convert|870|mi|0|abbr=off}} of the Angara, finally reaching Yeniseysk and discovering that the Angara (a [[Buryat language|Buryat]] name) and [[Upper Tunguska]] (Verkhnyaya Tunguska, as initially known by Russians) are one and the same river.

In 1627 [[Pyotr Beketov]] was appointed Yenisei [[voevoda]] in [[Siberia]]. He successfully carried out the voyage to collect taxes from [[Zabaykalye]] Buryats, becoming the first Russian to step in [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryatia]]. He founded the first Russian settlement there, Rybinsky ostrog. Beketov was sent to the Lena River in 1631, where in 1632 he founded [[Yakutsk]] and sent his Cossacks to explore the [[Aldan River|Aldan]] and farther down the Lena, to found new fortresses, and to collect taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lincoln 1994|Lincoln 1994]], p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Yakutsk soon turned into a major starting point for further Russian expeditions eastward, southward and northward. [[Maksim Perfilyev]], who earlier had been one of the founders of Yeniseysk, founded [[Bratsk]]y ostrog on the Angara in 1631, and in 1638 he became the first Russian to step into [[Transbaikalia]], travelling there from Yakutsk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#The Perfilyevs|The Perfilyevs]], web {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sbaikal|Sbaikal]], web {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baikal sea.gif|thumb|right|A map of [[Irkutsk]] and [[Lake Baikal]] in its neighbourhood, as depicted in the late-17th-century [[Remezov Chronicle]]]]
In 1643 [[Kurbat Ivanov]] led a group of Cossacks from Yakutsk to the south of the [[Baikal Mountains]] and discovered [[Lake Baikal]], visiting its [[Olkhon Island]]. Later Ivanov made the first chart and description of Baikal.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lincoln 1994|Lincoln 1994]], p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russians reach the Pacific===
In 1639 a group of explorers led by [[Ivan Moskvitin]] became the first Russians to reach the Pacific Ocean and to discover the [[Sea of Okhotsk]], having built a winter camp on its shore at the [[Ulya River]] mouth. The Cossacks learned from the locals about the large [[Amur River]] far to the south. In 1640 they apparently sailed south, explored the south-eastern shores of the Okhotsk Sea, perhaps reaching the mouth of the [[Amur River]] and possibly discovering the [[Shantar Islands]] on their way back. Based on Moskvitin's account, [[Kurbat Ivanov]] drew the first Russian map of the [[Far East]] in 1642.

In 1643, [[Vasily Poyarkov]] crossed the [[Stanovoy Range]] and reached the upper [[Zeya River]] in the country of the [[Daur people|Daurs]], who were paying tribute to the [[Manchu]] Chinese. After wintering, in 1644 Poyarkov pushed down the Zeya and became the first Russian to reach the [[Amur River]]. He sailed down the Amur and finally discovered the mouth of that great river from land. Since his Cossacks provoked the enmity of the locals behind, Poyarkov chose a different way back. They built boats and in 1645 sailed along the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] coast to the [[Ulya River]] and spent the next winter in the huts that had been built by [[Ivan Moskvitin]] six years earlier. In 1646 they returned to Yakutsk.

In 1644 [[Mikhail Stadukhin]] discovered the [[Kolyma River]] and founded [[Srednekolymsk]]. A merchant named [[Fedot Alekseyev Popov]] organized a further expedition eastward, and [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] became a captain of one of the [[Koch (boat)|kochi]]. In 1648 they sailed from [[Srednekolymsk]] down to the Arctic and after some time they rounded [[Cape Dezhnyov]], thus becoming the first explorers to pass through the [[Bering Strait]] and to discover [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]] and the [[Bering Sea]]. All their kochi and most of their men (including Popov himself) were lost in storms and clashes with the natives. A small group led by Dezhnyov reached the mouth of the [[Anadyr River]] and sailed up it in 1649, having built new boats from the wreckage. They founded [[Anadyrsk]] and were stranded there, until Stadukhin found them, coming from Kolyma by land.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fisher 1981|Fisher 1981]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Stadukhin set off south in 1651 and discovered [[Penzhin Bay]] on the northern coast of the [[Okhotsk Sea]]. He also may have explored the western shores of [[Kamchatka]].

In 1649–50 [[Yerofey Khabarov]] became the second Russian to explore the [[Amur River]]. Through [[Olyokma]], [[Tungur]] and [[Shilka River]]s he reached Amur ([[Dauria]]), returned to [[Yakutsk]] and then back to Amur with a larger force in 1650–53. This time he [[Russian-Manchu border conflicts|was met with armed resistance]]. He built winter quarters at [[Albazin]], then sailed down Amur and found Achansk, which preceded the present-day [[Khabarovsk]], defeating or evading large armies of [[Transbaikal|Daurian]] [[Manchu]] Chinese and [[Koreans]] on his way. He charted the Amur in his ''Draft of the Amur river''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dymytryshyn 1985|Dymytryshyn 1985]], web&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Russians held on to the Amur Region until 1689, when by the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] this land was assigned to [[Imperial Chinese|Chinese Empire]] (it was returned, however, by the [[Treaty of Aigun]] in 1858).

In 1659–65 [[Kurbat Ivanov]] was the next head of [[Anadyrsk]]y ostrog after [[Semyon Dezhnyov]]. In 1660 he sailed from [[Anadyr Bay]] to [[Cape Dezhnyov]]. Atop his earlier pioneering charts, Ivanov is credited with creation of the early map of [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]] and [[Bering Strait]], which was the first to show on paper (very schematically) the yet undiscovered [[Wrangel Island]], both [[Diomede Islands]] and Alaska, based on the data collected from the natives of Chukotka.

So, by the mid-17th century, Russians established the borders of their country close to modern ones, and explored almost the whole of Siberia, except the eastern [[Kamchatka]] and some regions north of the Arctic Circle. The conquest of Kamchatka later would be achieved in the early 1700s by [[Vladimir Atlasov]], while the discovery of the Arctic coastline and Alaska would be completed by the [[Great Northern Expedition]] in 1733–1743.

European overseas expansion led to the contact between the Old and New Worlds producing the [[Columbian Exchange]],&lt;ref name="Mayne 2009"&gt;[[#Mayne 2009|Mayne 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; named after Columbus. It involved the transfer of goods unique to one hemisphere to another. Europeans brought cattle, horses, and sheep to the New World, and from the New World Europeans received tobacco, potatoes and [[maize]]. Other items becoming important in global trade were the [[sugarcane]] and [[cotton]] crops of the Americas, and the gold and silver brought from the Americas not only to Europe but elsewhere in the Old World.

The new trans-oceanic links and their domination by the European powers led to the [[Imperialism|Age of Imperialism]], where European colonial powers came to control most of the planet. The European appetite for trade, commodities, empire and slaves greatly affected many other areas of the world. Spain participated in the destruction of aggressive empires in the Americas, only to substitute its own, and forcibly replaced the original religions. The pattern of territorial aggression was repeated by other European empires, most notably the Dutch, Russian, French and British. Christianity replaced older "pagan" rituals, as were new languages, political and sexual cultures, and in some areas like North America, Australia, New Zealand and [[Argentina]], the [[indigenous peoples]] were abused and driven off most of their lands, being reduced to small, dependent minorities.
[[File:Namban-08.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Portuguese ''[[wiktionary:南蛮人|Nanbanjin]]'' arriving at Japan much to the surprise of locals, detail from a [[Nanban trade|Nanban]] panel of the [[Kanō school]], 1593–1600]]
Similarly, in coastal Africa, local states supplied the appetite of European [[History of slavery|slave traders]], changing the complexion of coastal African states and fundamentally altering the nature of [[African slave trade|African slavery]], causing impacts on societies and economies deep inland. (See [[Atlantic slave trade]]).

Aboriginal peoples were living in North America at this time and still do today. There were many conflicts between Europeans and Natives. The Europeans had many advantages over the natives. They gave them diseases that they had not been exposed to before and this wiped out 50–90% of their population. (See [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas]].)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cook 1998|Cook 1998]], p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maize]] and [[Cassava|manioc]] were introduced into Africa in the 16th century by the Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;[[#OSU 2006|OSU 2006]], news.&lt;/ref&gt; They are now important staple foods, replacing native African crops.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0154e/A0154E02.HTM The cassava transformation in Africa]". The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scitizen 2007|Scitizen 2007]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred W. Crosby]] speculated that increased production of maize, manioc, and other New World crops led to heavier concentrations of population in the areas from which slavers captured their victims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crosby 1972|Crosby 1972]], p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th-century economy of China, the [[Ming Dynasty]] was stimulated by trade with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], and [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]]. China became involved in a new global trade of goods, plants, animals, and food crops known as the [[Columbian Exchange]]. Trade with [[Early modern Europe|European powers]] and the Japanese brought in massive amounts of silver, which then replaced copper and paper [[banknote]]s as the common [[medium of exchange]] in China. During the last decades of the Ming the flow of silver into China was greatly diminished, thereby undermining state revenues and indeed the entire Ming economy. This damage to the economy was compounded by the effects on agriculture of the incipient [[Little Ice Age]], natural calamities, crop failure, and sudden epidemics. The ensuing breakdown of authority and people's livelihoods allowed rebel leaders such as [[Li Zicheng]] to challenge [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] authority.

[[File:Jesuites en chine.jpg|thumb|[[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit]] scholars collaborated extensively with Chinese astronomers, introducing [[Copernican principle]]s. Top: [[Matteo Ricci]], [[Adam Schall von Bell|Adam Schaal]] and [[Ferdinand Verbiest]] (1623–1688); Bottom: [[Xu Guangqi|Paul Siu (Xu Guangqi)]], ''Colao'' or Prime Minister of State, and his granddaughter Candide Hiu]]

New crops that had come to Asia from the Americas via the Spanish colonizers in the 16th century contributed to the Asia's population growth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Columbia University 2009|Columbia University 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the bulk of imports to China were silver, the Chinese also purchased New World crops from the [[Spanish Empire]]. This included [[sweet potato]]es, [[maize]], and peanuts, foods that could be cultivated in lands where traditional Chinese staple crops—wheat, millet, and rice—could not grow, hence facilitating a rise in the population of China.&lt;ref name="Ebrey 2006, p. 211"&gt;[[#Ebrey 2006|Ebrey 2006]], p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crosby 1972|Crosby 1972]], pp. 198–201&lt;/ref&gt; In the Song Dynasty (960–1279), rice had become the major staple crop of the poor;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gernet 1962|Gernet 1962]], p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; after sweet potatoes were introduced to China around 1560, it gradually became the traditional food of the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crosby 1972|Crosby 1972]], p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of the Portuguese to Japan in 1543 initiated the [[Nanban trade|Nanban trade period]], with the Japanese adopting several technologies and cultural practices, like the [[arquebus]], European-style cuirasses, European ships, Christianity, decorative art, and language. After the Chinese had banned direct trade by Chinese merchants with Japan, the Portuguese filled this commercial vacuum as intermediaries between China and Japan. The Portuguese bought Chinese silk and sold it to the Japanese in return for Japanese-mined silver; since silver was more highly valued in China, the Portuguese could then use Japanese silver to buy even larger stocks of Chinese silk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spence 1999|Spence 1999]], pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1573—after the Spanish established a trading base in Manila—the Portuguese intermediary trade was trumped by the prime source of incoming silver to China from the Spanish Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian Jesuit [[Matteo Ricci]] (1552–1610) was the first European allowed into the Forbidden City. He taught the Chinese how to construct and play the [[spinet]], translated Chinese texts into Latin and vice versa, and worked closely with his Chinese associate [[Xu Guangqi]] (1562–1633) on mathematical work.

As a wider variety of global luxury commodities entered the European markets by sea, previous European markets for [[luxury good]]s stagnated. The Atlantic trade largely supplanted pre-existing [[Maritime republics|Italian]] and [[Hanseatic League|German]] trading powers which had relied on their Baltic, Russian and Islamic trade links. The new commodities also caused [[social change]], as sugar, spices, silks and chinawares entered the luxury markets of Europe.

The European economic centre shifted from the Mediterranean to Western Europe. The city of [[Antwerp]], part of the [[Duchy of Brabant]], became "the centre of the ''entire'' international economy",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1985|Braudel 1985]], p.&amp;nbsp;143.&lt;/ref&gt; and the richest city in Europe at this time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dunton 1896|Dunton 1896]], p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Centred in Antwerp first and then in [[Amsterdam]], "[[Dutch Golden Age]]" was tightly linked to the Age of Discovery. [[Francesco Guicciardini]], a Venetian envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass Antwerp in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with [[black pepper|pepper]] and [[cinnamon]] would unload their cargo. With many foreign merchants resident in the city and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very international, with merchants and traders from [[Venice]], [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], Spain and Portugal and a policy of toleration, which attracted a large [[Orthodox Jew]]ish community. The city experienced three booms during its golden age, the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by New World silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the [[Italian War of 1551–1559|Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis]], in 1559, based on the textiles industry.

Despite initial hostilities, by 1549 the Portuguese were sending annual trade missions to [[Shangchuan Island]] in China. In 1557 they managed to convince the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] court to agree on a legal port treaty that would establish [[Macau]] as an official Portuguese trade colony.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese friar [[Gaspar da Cruz]] (c. 1520 February 5, 1570) wrote the first complete book on China and the Ming Dynasty that was published in Europe; it included information on its geography, provinces, royalty, official class, bureaucracy, shipping, architecture, farming, craftsmanship, merchant affairs, clothing, religious and social customs, music and instruments, writing, education, and justice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#AAS 1976|Aas 1976]], pp. 410–411.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DelftChina18thCenturyCompanieDesIndes.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Delftware]] depicting Chinese scenes, 18th century. [[Ernest Cognacq Museum]]]]
From China the major exports were [[silk]] and [[porcelain]], adapted to meet European tastes. The [[Chinese export porcelain]]s were held in such great esteem in Europe that, in English, ''[[wikt:china|china]]'' became a commonly–used synonym for ''porcelain''. [[Kraak porcelain]] (believed to be named after the Portuguese [[carrack]]s in which it was transported) was among the first Chinese ware to arrive in Europe in mass quantities. Only the richest could afford these early imports, and Kraak often featured in [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch still life]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;For a study on foreign objects in Dutch paintings, see [[#Hochstrasser 2007|Hochstrasser 2007]], ''Still life and trade in the Dutch golden age''.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a lively trade with the East, having imported 6 million porcelain items from China to Europe between the years 1602 to 1682.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volker 1971|Volker 1971]], p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese workmanship impressed many. Between 1575 and 1587 [[Medici porcelain]] from [[Florence]] was the first successful attempt to imitate Chinese porcelain. Although Dutch potters did not immediately imitate Chinese porcelain, they began to do it when the supply to Europe was interrupted, after the death of [[Wanli Emperor]] in 1620. Kraak, mainly the [[blue and white porcelain]], was imitated all over the world by potters in [[Arita, Saga|Arita, Japan]] and [[Iran|Persia]]—where Dutch merchants turned when the fall of the Ming Dynasty rendered Chinese originals unavailable&lt;ref&gt;[[#Howard 1978|Howard 1978]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;—and ultimately in [[Delftware]]. Dutch and later [[English Delftware]] inspired by Chinese designs persisted from about 1630 to the mid-18th century alongside European patterns.

[[File:Heem, Jan Davidsz. de - A Richly Laid Table with Parrots - detail cup.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Jan Davidsz. de Heem]], detail of silverware from "A Richly Laid Table with Parrots", c. 1650]]

[[Antonio de Morga]] (1559–1636), a Spanish official in [[Manila]], listed an extensive inventory of goods that were traded by Ming China at the turn of the 16th to 17th century, noting there were "rarities which, did I refer to them all, I would never finish, nor have sufficient paper for it".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], pp. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt; After noting the variety of silk goods traded to Europeans, Ebrey writes of the considerable size of commercial transactions: In one case a galleon to the Spanish territories in the New World carried over 50,000 pairs of silk stockings. In return China imported mostly silver from Peruvian and Mexican mines, [[Manila galleon|transported via Manila]]. Chinese merchants were active in these trading ventures, and many emigrated to such places as the [[Philippines]] and Borneo to take advantage of the new commercial opportunities.&lt;ref name="Ebrey 2006, p. 211"/&gt;

The increase in gold and silver experienced by [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] coincided with a major [[inflation]]ary cycle both within Spain and Europe, known as the [[price revolution]]. Spain had amassed large quantities of gold and silver from the New World.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Walton 1994|Walton 1994]], pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1520s large scale extraction of silver from Mexico's [[Guanajuato]] began. With the opening of the silver mines in [[Zacatecas]] and Bolivia's [[Potosí]] in 1546 large shipments of silver became the fabled source of wealth. During the 16th century, Spain held the equivalent of US$1.5 trillion (1990 terms) in gold and silver from [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]]. Being the most powerful European monarch at a time full of war and religious conflicts, the [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg]] rulers spent the wealth in wars and arts across Europe. "I learnt a proverb here", said a French traveller in 1603: "Everything is dear in Spain except silver".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1979|Braudel 1979]], p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The spent silver, suddenly spread throughout a previously cash-starved Europe, caused widespread inflation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tracy 1994|Tracy 1994]], p. 655.&lt;/ref&gt; The inflation was worsened by a growing population with a static production level, low salaries and a rising cost of living, which damaged local industry. Increasingly, Spain became dependent on the revenues flowing in from the mercantile empire in the Americas, leading to Spain's first bankruptcy in 1557 due to rising military costs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1979|Braudel 1979]], pp. 523–25&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip II of Spain defaulted on debt payments in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596. The increase in prices as a result of currency circulation fuelled the growth of the commercial [[middle class]] in Europe, the ''[[bourgeoisie]]'', which came to influence the politics and culture of many countries.

One effect of the inflation, particularly in Great Britain, was that tenant farmers who held long term leases from lords saw real decreases in rent. Some lords opted to sell their leased land, giving rise to small land-owing farmers such as [[yeoman]] and gentlemen farmers.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Diagram of Holland Channel cable.png|thumb|300px|right|A period depiction of the Ambrose Channel pilot cable in action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bond|1920}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''Ambrose Channel pilot cable''', also called the '''Ambrose Channel leader cable''', was a cable laid in [[Ambrose Channel]] at the entrance to the [[Port of New York and New Jersey]] that provided an audio tone for guiding ships in and out of port at times of low visibility. The cable was laid during 1919 and 1920;  it had been removed from the channel and replaced by wireless technology by the end of the 1920s.
&lt;!-- Note: this image needs 500px as it has detail which gets blurred out at lower resolution. --&gt;

==Background==
[[Ambrose Channel]] is the only shipping channel in and out of the [[Port of New York and New Jersey]], an important [[commercial port]]. Delays posed a major problem for shipping en route to [[New York City]], and bad weather could close the channel for days. Ships were forced to wait at the harbor's entrance for conditions to clear. These delays cost shipping companies substantial amounts of money, with each ship costing between $500 and $4000 per hour it was stopped (roughly $5,700 to $46,000 in 2013 dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=249 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and operation==
[[File:Ambrose pilot cable cross section.png|thumb|The Cable was composed of several layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921b|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]The Ambrose leader cable was an armored cable with a single internal conductor (see picture) that acted like a long radio antenna laid on the channel floor. It originated at [[Fort Lafayette]] (near the present day [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge]]), then extended 16 miles down the [[Ambrose Channel]] to the vicinity of [[Lightship Ambrose]] offshore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|pp=44–45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was powered by a generator at Fort Lafayette that produced 500&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]] (cycles per second) current at 400&amp;nbsp;volts, resulting in an alternating electromagnetic field along the length of the cable that could be detected to approximately a thousand yards away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=51}}. Other voltages may have been used in subsequent operation.&lt;/ref&gt;  The current was mechanically keyed to send the word "NAVY" in [[Morse Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|New York Times|1920|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ship received by a pair of [[induction coil]]s hung on opposite sides of the ship, and fed through an amplifier into a headset (see diagram, below). By switching between coils, the relative strength of the signal on each side could be compared. The ship maintained a course parallel to the cable by maneuvering to keep the signal strength constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|pp=46–47}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and development==
[[File:SE 1600 amplifier ckt.png|thumb|200px|Two-stage vacuum-tube amplifier alternately takes input from inductance coils (top) hung on each side of ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The pilot cable required a series of prior discoveries and inventions. In 1882,  A. R. Sennett patented the use of a submerged electrical cable to communicate with a ship at a fixed location. Around the same time Charles Stevenson patented a means of navigating ships over an electrically charge cable using a [[galvanometer]]. The method became practical when Earl Hanson adapted early [[vacuum tube]] circuits to amplify the signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=34}}; {{Harvnb|Current History|1921|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert H. Marriott]] was a radio pioneer employed by the Navy in [[Puget Sound]], where he conducted early experiments with underwater pilot cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geselowitz|2009}}; {{Harvnb|Marriott|1924}}; {{Harvnb|Woods|1980|p=523}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His results were sufficiently promising that he recommended further development to Commander Stanford C. Hooper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=250 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October, 1919 Commander Hooper instructed A. Crossley, an expert radio aid, to develop and test the concept on a larger scale at the [[Naval Submarine Base New London#History|New London Naval Base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=250 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Crossley installed a longer version of the cable that Marriott had designed. He used a wooden hulled [[launch (ship)|launch]] for the first round of tests before moving to a steel-hulled [[submarine]] for later tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=250 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both types of vessel picked up the signal and followed the underwater test cable without problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=250 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Installation and testing==
[[File:Ambrose Channel pilot cable in action.PNG|frame|left|Commander R. F. McConnell on the USS ''Semmes'' with the "Hanson apparatus".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nautical Gazette|1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Following the successful tests at New London, the Navy proceeded to large scale testing in Ambrose Channel late in 1919. The [[Minelayer#Naval minelayers|minelayer]] ''Ord'' laid a pilot cable composed of 2,000 feet of leaded and armored cable, 2,000 feet of leaded cable, and 83,000 feet of standard rubber-insulated cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|pp=38–39 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[USS O'Brien (DD-51)|USS ''O'Brien'']] was fitted with receiving equipment and attempted to follow the cable out of the channel. Unfortunately, it was unable to detect a signal past the 1,000 foot mark, where a break in the cable had prevented the signal from continuing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=40 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The break in the cable was repaired, but over the course of the winter of 1919-1920, crews found that the cable had broken in a total of fifty-two different places due to the strain placed on it while it was being laid. The damage was irreparable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=40 }}; {{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=250 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Going back to the drawing board, engineers tested 150-foot segments of three different types of cable and used the results to design a new full-size pilot cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|pp=40–41}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Navy ordered 87,000 feet of cable from the Simplex Wire and Cable Company in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once complete, the cable was loaded onto the [[USS Pequot (ID-2998)|USS ''Pequot'']] in the [[Boston Navy Yard]]. The ship arrived in New York on July 31, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=43 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ambrose Channel was already crossed by three telegraph cables, owned by [[Western Union]], the [[United States Army|Army]], and the [[New York City Police Department|police]], all of which had to be raised to the surface so the pilot cable could be laid underneath them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=43 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The installation of the cable was completed on August 6, 1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|pp=38–39 }}; {{Harvnb|New York Times|1920|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and by August 28, electrical tests showed that both the sending and receiving circuits were functioning properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Los Angeles Times|1920}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Navy tested the cable using the seagoing tug [[USS Algorma (AT-34)|USS ''Algorma'']]. It then invited "representatives of various radio companies, shipping interests, [[Maritime pilot|pilots']] associations, governmental bureaus, naval attaches, and others" for a public demonstration on board the destroyer [[USS Semmes (DD-189)|USS ''Semmes'']] from October 6 through October 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=290}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ship's windows were covered with canvas and the captains took turns navigating using only the audio cues from the cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|New York Times|1920|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cable was well received. Even before the New London tests, the Washington Post called it "the greatest development in marine travel since the invention of the steam turbine"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Washington Post|1919|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Los Angeles Times declared the technology to be "one of the greatest peacetime gifts that science has devised."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Los Angeles Times|1919}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Once operational, the latter newspaper called it "the greatest safeguard devised for shipping in modern history".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Los Angeles Times|1920}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a 1921 trade magazine, leader cables had five functions: "to enable a ship to make a good landfall in thick weather, to lead a ship up the harbor, to lead a ship from open water through a restricted channel to open water on the far side, to give warning of outlying dangers, and to assist a vessel to keep a straight course from port to port and thus save fuel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1921|p=951}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1922, the publication ''Radio World'' stated that the cable's first two years of operation had been successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gordon|1922|p=72}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 1922, ''Radio Broadcast'' boasted about the money saved by the cable as well as the ease of using it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=249 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cable itself was paid for using public funds, but it was the responsibility of ship owners to outfit their vessels with receiving equipment. Installation of the cable cost roughly $50,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=249 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the listening apparatus installed on each ship using the channel cost $1,200,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|New York Times|1920|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; compared with hourly costs of delays that ranged from $500 to $4,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=249 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Radio Broadcast'' expressed the belief that navigation cables would become common for both ships and aircraft: "...there is a future for the audio cable... Its fullest usefulness at American ports and elsewhere waits, however, on that large appreciation of radio devices for sea as well as air navigation which pilots, both on the sea and in the air, expect, but do not as yet demand."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=251}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Obsolescence and legacy ==
Despite the media hype, it appears that the Ambrose Channel pilot cable never met with large scale commercial success. Initially, some contemporaries of the cable proposed that it be extended several miles past the Ambrose light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such plans never came to fruition, as advances in technology rendered the pilot cable obsolete.  By 1929 the ''Baltimore Sun'' reported ships navigating the Channel blindly without making any reference to the cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baltimore Sun|1929}}; {{Harvnb|Putnam|1924|p=215}}; {{Harvnb|Science|1924|p=xiv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, Marriott publicly complained that navigation cables still had unrealized potential for guiding ships. &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Science News-Letter|1929}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Leader cable systems appear to have been made obsolete by the refinement of [[radio direction finding]] and the placement of [[Electric beacon|radio beacons]] (low-power radio transmitters) at strategic locations. Those beacons are analogous to lighthouses, but can be "seen" in all weather, and are used for navigation in the same way as regular lighthouses.  The first successful application of these radio beacons as "radio fog signals" were three stations installed near New York in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Putnam|1924}}; {{Harvnb|Radio Broadcast|1922|p=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1924, there were eleven stations in operation in the United States and nearly three hundred ships suitably equipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Putnam|1924|p=213}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1930, an article in the ''Journal of the [[Royal Society of Arts]]'' declared that "wireless aids and echo sounding have superseded [the leader cable]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cooper|1930|pp=995–996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, more modern navigation tools such as [[radar]], [[global positioning system|GPS]], and lighted [[buoy]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s help ships navigate Ambrose Channel.



Earl Hanson, one of the key players in designing the Ambrose Channel cable, writing for ''Popular Mechanics,'' viewed it as a step toward applying radio cable technology in vast swaths of everyday life, including guiding aircraft and navigating and powering automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hanson|1934}}; {{Harvnb|Yates|Pacent|1922|p=296}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ambrose Channel cable was removed from the channel and used in testing an early system of [[autolanding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Howeth|1963|loc= Chap. 28, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112064674325;view=1up;seq=367 §16]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The cable found no more success in that role than it did in guiding ships. The [[Blind Landing Experimental Unit]] later tried a similar system briefly before also abandoning it in favor of wireless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wood|1930|p=13 }}; {{Harvnb|Davis|1922|p=5}}; {{Harvnb|Armstrong|1930|pp=1–2}}; {{Harvnb|Perry|2004|p=100}}; {{Harvnb|Hanson|1919|p=489}}; {{Harvnb|Current History|1921|p=162}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Botanical garden of Upper Brittany''' ([[French language|French]]: Jardin botanique de Haute-Bretagne) is a private estate, open to the public, with an area of 25&amp;nbsp;hectares, located in the [[Ille-et-Vilaine]] department of  [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]], near the medieval city of [[Fougères]]. The park is part of the estate of "La Foltière", where stands the "Château de la Foltière", built in 1847.

[[File:Le jardin de la Source bleue au centre du Parc Botanique de Haute Bretagne.JPG|thumb|left|300px|The garden of the blue spring]]

== Location ==
The Botanical garden of Upper Brittany is located on the village of Le Châtellier (Ille-et-Vilaine), approximately 10&amp;nbsp;kilometers from the city of Fougères, between [[Rennes]] and the [[Mont Saint-Michel]], near the A84 motorway.

== History ==
"Foltiere" is the name of the estate, which means "ground where beech trees grow", the word "fou" being ancient french for "beech tree".
The park was created in 1847,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120729031227/http://www.bretagne35.com/parcs-et-jardins/parc-floral-de-haute-bretagne Parc floral de Haute-Bretagne] site de [http://www.bretagne35.com/ Tourisme Haute-Bretagne]&lt;/ref&gt; around the Château de la Foltière. In 1796 the old [[manor house]] was the headquarters of an uprising against the government of the French Republic led by Count [[Joseph de Puisaye]].&lt;ref name="Parc floral"&gt;[http://www.parcsetjardins.fr/bretagne/ille_et_vilaine/parc_floral_de_haute_bretagne-307.html PARC FLORAL DE HAUTE BRETAGNE (25 ha)] site du [http://www.parcsetjardins.fr/index.php Comité des parcs et jardins de France]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1820, the Estate of "La Foltière" is bought by the family Frontin des Buffards.&lt;ref name="Parc floral"/&gt; In 1847, the land surrounding the pond in the park was redesigned as an English romantic landscape garden, with winding paths that follow the terrain, and a view from the lawn in front of the house to the church tower in the village.

The botanical park is made up of three parts :

==== The Arcadia Gardens ====
The first part : Arcadia refers to classical antiquity and the youthfulness of the garden.
* The path of white pearls. This pathway is made up of five separate enclosures for which the gardener has composed five maxims. These emphasis the qualities he deems essential in the composition of a garden and where species from the five continents have been planted.
* The [[1001 nights]] garden, inspired by Moorish water gardens, is the first garden one comes across on entering the park. A canal with fountains runs through the garden. At the far end are three cypress trees and on either side luxuriant vegetation including jasmine, damask roses and daphnes. Our senses are lulled by the music of running water, the heady perfume and beautiful colours of the exotic flowers.
* The city of antiquity evokes a journey around the Mediterranean. An archaeological site is represented by three central quadrants lined on either side by rows of juniper trees, and columns covered with climbing roses complete the scene. The fourth quadrant has retained its original function as a vegetable garden. And like a frieze enhancing a green dominated landscape, flower beds of hardy perennials surround the antique city.
* The city of [[Knossos]], backs on to the walls of the city of Antiquity. The labyrinth is composed of a collection of 480 varieties of Camellia. The variety « sinesis » or «chinese tea » flowers from around mid-September. Next comes the « Camellia Sansanqua » in early October and then the « Camellia japonica ». March is the best time to discover the full range. At the end of the maze a [[minotaur]] awaits the children…
* Bamboo grove, a maze of bamboos which gives onto a pond planted with lotus (which flower at the end of summer) and in the middle of which are three pyramids covered with miniature bamboos
* The secret garden access to which is via an impressive and ornate staircase, is inspired by the humanistic ideal of the Italian Renaissance. It revives the « Secret Garden », vegetal parlour  concept inherited from mediaeval tradition.
* The ancient rose walk relates the starting story from the first rose bushes known in antiquity down to those at the beginning of the 20th century…Mysterious and complicated hybridizations. A story illustrated by the natural grace of these bushes, the beauty of their flowers and their delicate perfume.
* [[Dionysus]]' garden. Here one sees a combination of shrubs and perennials. Vines bring a lighter touch to the linear fencing at the entrance to the garden.
* Robinson labyrinth, where children love getting lost in a mage of greenery.
* The garden of Olympus. Four circles evoke the twelve gods and goddesses of [[Mount Olympus]] and the daughters of [[Zeus]]: the twelve hours, the nine Muses and the three graces. Opposite Mount Olympus one can see the box which Zeus gave to Pandora.
* The [[prehistoric]] garden. This garden is an evocation of the flora existent during the [[Cretaceous]] era over 100&amp;nbsp;million years ago and before dinosaurs disappeared. It explains the evolution of plant life.

==== The Romantic Gardens ====

The second part represents maturity and plenitude - construction of the manor house and development and perfection of the gardens. Here is a romantic landscape garden where dreams and exotism are part of everyday life.
* The garden of [[the Rising Sun]]. A gentle combination of mineral, aquatic and vegetal. In this locality, lulled by the music of a waterfall, only abstract beauty counts-that of plants and stones. The trees are works of art, constantly changing form by pruning. Three aspects of traditional Japanese gardens are evoked here:- the walking garden, the zen garden and the tea garden.
* Copse "Decisif". Six yew trees planted two by two to form a triangle.
* The garden of exotic fragances where species from far afield can be found, such as « richeas ».
* The garden of the blue spring. Set around a pond, this garden is composed solely of blue flowers but with an infinite variety of shades- symbol of eternal love.
* The carnivores' den. This marshy area is inhabited by fascinating insect-eating plants. Venus fly-trap and others.
* The garden of the four seasons is situated opposite the manor house. There are four flower beds, one for each season.
* The modern rose path which is lined with beautiful modern rose bushes.

==== The Twilight Gardens ====

The third part offers a timeless composition which represents the development of the garden, old age and twilight of life.
* The evening resting place contains a collection of mountain laurel and « moschata » roses. A central tetraplyon offers views of the adjacent gardens.
* The starry nights garden. This garden is tucked away in the clearing of the « little wood of confidences ».Here the plants have black leaves and delicate yellow petals.
* The garden of dreams on a summer evening. Three enclosures display collections of agapanthes, crocosmias, echinaceas and peonies planted in small square boxes.
* The garden of the April moon. Peonies and shrubs with leaves which flush scarlet in the autumn are to be found in this garden.
* The sunset garden, mirror of the north facade of the chateau, this garden benefits from the last rays of light before the sun sets. A curved flower bed contains plants which flower a vivid yellow.
* The garden of the old oak tree which is dominated by the presence of a three-hundred-year-old oak tree.

== Quality label ==

The [[French Ministry of Culture]] classified the Parc botanique de Haute-Bretagne as a "Jardin remarquable", [[Notable gardens of France]].
The French Ministry of Tourism allotted to the botanical garden the label « Qualité Tourisme » in 2011.

'''Bouldergaine''' is a variant sport combining the disciplines of [[bouldering]] and [[rogaining]].

The sport takes place in a large boulder field, which is mapped in a similar way to a traditional rogaine. Teams of 2 people choose which checkpoints to visit within a time limit with the intent of maximizing their score. At each checkpoint is at least one extra bonus point station, which requires scrambling or climbing to access. A successful team will require a mixture of fitness, climbing ability and map skills.

The world's first bouldergaine was held on March 15, 2014 at [[Castle Hill, New Zealand|Kura Tawhiti / Castle Hill]] in Canterbury, New Zealand. The event was organised by the [[New Zealand Alpine Club]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contour Lines|url=http://papo.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013-12-December.pdf|publisher=papo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over 100 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBS Website|url=http://nbs.org.nz/news/2014/worlds-first-bouldergaine-a-success|publisher=nbs.org.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stuff.co.nz|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/9830768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18146">'''CLLI code''' (sometimes referred to as '''CLLI name''' or '''COMMON LANGUAGE Location Identifier Code''', and often pronounced  as ''silly'') is a [[Common Language Information Services]] identifier used within the North American [[telecommunications]] industry to specify the location and function of telecommunications equipment or of a relevant location such as an international border or a supporting equipment location, like a manhole or pole.&lt;ref name="CLLI desc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.commonlanguage.com/resources/commonlang/productshowroom/product/clli/|publisher=Common Language Information Services|accessdate=26 March 2018|title=CLLI Codes Technical Description}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally, they were used by [[Bell Telephone Company|Bell Telephone]] companies, but since all other telecommunications carriers needed to interconnect with the dominant Bell companies, CLLI code adoption eventually became universal.  CLLI codes are now maintained and issued by [[Telcordia]], which claims trademarks on the names "Common Language" and "CLLI".&lt;ref name = "CLLI desc"/&gt;

CLLI codes are useful to telecommunications companies for ordering phone service, for the rating of call detail records for billing purposes, and to assist in tracing calls.  CLLI codes are associated with Vertical and Horizontal coordinates (frequently abbreviated to "V and H coordinates"), which were developed by [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] researcher Jay K. Donald to provide a relatively simple method of calculating distance between two network locations.&lt;ref name="TRA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trainfo.com/products_services/tra/vhpage.html|publisher=Telcordia|accessdate=22 February 2009|title=Vertical and Horizontal Coordinates}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various mileage-sensitive services are priced according to the V and H coordinates associated with the two endpoints' CLLI codes.&lt;ref name="TRA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computeruser.com/resources/dictionary/get_by_category/23/130|publisher=ComputerUser, Inc.|accessdate=22 February 2009|title=High-Tech Dictionary - VOIP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The first six characters of a CLLI code represent the place the code refers to and contain two code elements:

* Four characters to denote the geographical area and the geographical area type (for example, city, town, and borough), known as the Geographical code element.&lt;ref name="iowa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iub.iowa.gov/sites/default/files/files/regulated_industries/telecom/NRRIC.pdf|title=Intercompany Responsibilities Within The Telecommunications Industry|work=ATIS/NIIF 0015 Issue 1.0|accessdate=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two characters to denote the state, province, or country, known as the Geopolitical code element.&lt;ref name="state.ia.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.ia.us/government/com/util/docs/misc/NRRIC.pdf|title=Intercompany Responsibilities Within The Telecommunications Industry|work=ATIS/NIIF 0015 Issue 1.0|accessdate=2012-06-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021031250/http://www.state.ia.us/government/com/util/docs/misc/NRRIC.pdf|archivedate=2012-10-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The codes HS (high seas) and EO (earth orbit) are reserved for ships at sea and satellites, respectively.&lt;ref name="1982 CLLI"&gt;[http://etler.com/docs/BSP/795/795-100-100_I5.pdf CLLI code description], Bell System Practices (AT&amp;amp;T standard) Section 795-100-100 Issue 5, October 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

For the various code formats, the remaining two or five characters contain one of:
* A two-character building identifier, either two letters or two numbers, for telephone company buildings. Incumbent independent telephone companies will use two-letter identifiers with X as the first letter.
** The two-character building identifier may be followed by three characters to identify an individual switching or non-switching entity within the building.
* A non-building location, identified by a letter followed by four digits.
* A client site is identified by a digit, a letter, then three more digits for non-building locations.

There are four CLLI code formats.

===Network Site Code Format===

A Network Site code represents any existing or proposed building, structure, or enclosure, where there is a need to uniquely identify one or more network functions. Network Site codes are typically used to identify building locations, such as central office buildings.

* The first six characters are the city (four letters) and province/state (two letters). Each territory is normally identified using its two-letter [[ISO 3166-2:CA]] or [[ISO 3166-2:US]] postal abbreviation suffix (with exceptions: Québec as PQ and Nunavut written as VU).
* The seventh and eighth characters in this format are known as the Network Site code element and denote the specific location or building address.&lt;ref name="state.ia.us"/&gt; These will be either two letters or two numbers; a X followed by a letter identifies a local independent telephone company building.

===Network Entity Code Format===

CLLI codes in the Network Entity format are the most commonly used CLLI codes. Network Entity codes are eleven-character codes used to describe the location and function of network equipment.

* The first eight characters are the city, province/state and network site location (see Network Site Code Format, above).
* The ninth, tenth and eleventh characters of a Network Entity code specify a particular type of equipment function at a Network Site location.&lt;ref name="state.ia.us"/&gt;
** Three-letter entity codes often begin with two letters to identify combinations of switching equipment such as MG (crossbar exchange - marker group), SG (step-by-step exchange - step group), CG (electronic switching system - control group), DS (digital switch), CT (concentrator) or RS (remote switcher).&lt;ref name="1982 CLLI"/&gt;
** Non-switching entity codes may begin with A (administrative office space and computers), E (exchange switchroom), F (frame), K (software cross-connectable entity), M (maintenance group), P (test/service position), Q (radio tower), S (service centre), T (toll test) or W (miscellaneous), followed by anything except G (to avoid conflict with switches).
** Reserved final (eleventh) characters include B ('board' - operator and switchboard positions including '0' and '4-1-1'), D (various termination entities, including [[Mobile Telephone Switching Office|mobile]] or [[Competitive local exchange carrier|CLEC]] exchanges, hosted Centrex, 9-1-1 dispatch, time/weather and pre-recorded announcements), T (tandem), I, O, U, W or Y (not used). The specific type of board or termination entity is specified by the tenth character.

===Network Support Site Code Format===

A Network Support Site code represents any non-building structures or outside plant equipment such as Wireless Access Points, International Boundary Crossing Points, End-Points, Fiber Nodes, Junctions, Manholes, Poles, Base Transceiver Station / Radio Equipment and Repeaters.

This format contains 6 characters representing location and a 5-character Network Support Site Code element.

* The first six characters are the city (four letters) and province/state (two letters)
* The seventh character is a letter. X identifies any independent telephone company location. The letter otherwise is the location type:  B (international boundary crossing), E (end point or non-international boundary), J (junction), M (manhole), P (pole), Q (radio location), R (repeater), S (toll station) or U (other or utility (per Pete)).
* The eighth through eleventh characters contain a four-digit identifying number.

The code for a communications satellite is STLT (satellite) EO (earth orbit) Q (radio location) then a four-digit identifier.&lt;ref name="1982 CLLI"/&gt;

===Customer Site Code===

A Customer Site code is used to uniquely identify customer locations. These locations are required to identify customers, circuit terminations, facilities, or equipment for each specific customer for facility provisioning or other requirements. This format contains 6 characters representing location and a 5-character Customer Site Code element.

* The first six characters are the city (four letters) and province/state (two letters)
* The seventh character is a number, followed by a letter, then three more numbers.

Entities within client-owned buildings (such as [[Centrex]] installations) are coded in the same format as telephone company buildings.

== Examples ==

'''HSTNTXMOCG0'''
* HSTN = [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]
* TX = [[Texas]]
* MO = The AT&amp;T [[telephone exchange]] office at 4068 Bellaire Boulevard in [[West University Place, Texas]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/MapItDrawServlet?geo_id=16000US4877956&amp;_bucket_id=50&amp;tree_id=420&amp;context=saff&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on West University Place city]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}." ''[[United States Census Bureau]]''. Retrieved on February 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;—the office is known as the "Mohawk office"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.att.com/PublicAffairs/PublicPolicy/Wire_Centers/docs/Southwestern_Bell_Telephone_6-8-01.xls|publisher=Southwestern Bell Telephone|accessdate=22 February 2009|title=Southwestern Bell exchange list}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* CG0 = The first (or perhaps only) electronic [[telephone switch]] at that location (in this instance, [[analog signal|analog]] - now HSTNTXMODS0 as a digital switch)

This code shows two characteristics: 
* Telephone companies often give names to their central offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ourwebhome.com/TENP/TENproject.html|accessdate=22 February 2009|title=Telephone EXchange Name Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The names frequently relate to the [[telephone exchange names|name given to the exchanges]] served from that office in the days of two-letter, five-number dialing, where a [[telephone number]] might have been referred to as "MOhawk 3-1234". The numbers are now listed as all-figures, so (713) MOhawk x-xxxx becomes +1-713-66x-xxxx.
* The Geographical code field does not always align exactly with the city location.  West University Place is an [[enclave]] of Houston, Texas.

'''PTLDOR12DS0'''
* PTLD = [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]
* OR = [[Oregon]]
* 12 = The [[Qwest]] "Atlantic office" at 2911 NE 24th Ave&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telcodata.us/telcodata/switchinfo?clli=PTLDOR12DS0|publisher=Telcodata.us|accessdate=22 February 2009|title=Telcodata lookup}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* DS0 = The first (and perhaps only) [[Digital data|digital]] telephone switch at that location. While some telcos use -CG suffixes for both computer-controlled analogue and full-digital electronic switching systems, -DS is always a fully digital switch.

Some telephone companies named their central offices, but did not reflect this name in the CLLI code, as in the above example with a numeric location code.

'''PTLEORTEDS0'''
* PTLE = Portland
* OR = Oregon
* TE = A specific address: 6038 NE 78th Court&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telcodata.us/telcodata/switchinfo?clli=PTLEORTEDS0|publisher=Telcodata.us|accessdate=22 February 2009|title=Telcodata lookup}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* DS0 = The first (and perhaps only) digital telephone switch at that location

The item to note in the above example is that Portland is usually abbreviated as "PTLD", but because of the relatively small number of possible combinations available in the two-character location code, the city abbreviation must occasionally be modified for locations added later, usually by incrementing the fourth character in the code.

'''DLLSTXRNDS1'''
* DLLS = [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]
* TX = Texas
* RN = The Richardson office
* DS1 = The second digital telephone switch at that location

Note that this location is actually in [[Richardson, Texas]], not Dallas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telcodata.us/telcodata/switchinfo?clli=DLLSTXRNDS1|publisher=Telcodata.us|accessdate=22 February 2009|title=Telcodata lookup}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apparently, the organizational structure of [[Southwestern Bell|Southwestern Bell Telephone]] at the time considered Richardson to be within its own Dallas organization, although the cities themselves have always been legally separate.

'''SWASONXTSG1'''
* SWAS = [[Swastika, Ontario|Swastika]], a 1908 mining village on the [[Ontario Northland Railway]] at the edge of [[Kirkland Lake, Ontario|Kirkland Lake]]
* ON = Ontario
* XT = X indicated a nominally [[independent telephone company]], in this instance [[Timmins, Ontario|Timmins]]-area Northern Telephone Ltd.
* SG1 = a Western Electric [[Strowger switch|step-by-step]] exchange&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telcodata.us/view-switch-detail-by-clli?clli=SWASONXTSG1 SWASONXTSG1] on telcodata.us&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NorthernTel]]'s +1-705-642 exchange at 5 Cameron Avenue, Swastika was a throwback to a simpler era in which mechanical [[stepping switch]]es rotated in response to [[dial pulse]]s from [[rotary dial]] telephones. As a step-by-step exchange offers none of the [[calling feature]]s of an electronic or digital switch, these are becoming increasingly rare as mechanical switching equipment is displaced by electronics. This one held out a little longer than most as it was a small community in formerly independent telco territory, but was ultimately replaced by a digital remote station SWASONXTRSA controlled from Timmins TMNSONXTCG0.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.localcallingguide.com/lca_prefix.php?npa=705&amp;nxx=642&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OTWAON080MD'''
* OTWA = [[Ottawa]]
* ON = [[Ontario]]
* 08 = A [[Bell Canada]] co-location site on Iona Street in Ottawa
* 0 = Identifies a specific local exchange at the site (this one is [[Rogers Wireless]])
* MD = A [[mobile phone]] exchange or competitor's point of interconnection (POI) to an incumbent landline network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.localcallingguide.com/lca_prefix.php?switch=OTWAON080MD OTWAON080MD on localcallingguide.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers is not a landline [[ILEC|incumbent]] but a rival mobile telephone carrier with a block of 220000 Ottawa numbers. The Iona Street office (OTWAON08) is a [[co-location facility]] which hosts a landline exchange (incumbent [[Bell Canada]]'s OTWAON08 -CG0) and three rival mobile switches (-0MD is Rogers, -3MD is [[Telus Mobility|Telus]], -AMD is [[Bell Mobility]]), one for each major wireless carrier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.localcallingguide.com/lca_switch.php?switch=OTWAON08 OTWAON08 - Iona Street, Ottawa] on localcallingguide.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar naming conventions apply for [[Competitive local exchange carrier|CLEC]] exchanges at a point of interconnection to incumbent carrier networks. The suffix -MD nominally refers to "miscellaneous other termination entities".&lt;ref name="1982 CLLI"/&gt;

'''MALTON22CG1'''
* MALT = [[Malton, Ontario|Malton]]
* ON = Ontario
* 22 = An individual switching station (3255 Derry Rd E, Mississauga) located midway between [[Toronto]]'s city limits and the main airport
* CG1 = One of two electronic switches on the same site (both are actually digital [[Nortel]] [[DMS-100]]'s)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.localcallingguide.com/lca_prefix.php?switch=MALTON22CG1 MALTON22CG1] on localcallingguide.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Mississauga, Ontario|Mississauga]] is a sprawling half-million person suburb directly west of Toronto. It is in [[Regional Municipality of Peel|Peel Region]] and therefore in a different [[local interconnection region]], a different area code ([[area code 905|905]] instead of [[area code 416|416]]) and different, multiple rate centres (Clarkson, Streetsville, Cooksville, Malton, Port Credit; [[Bell Canada]] has no named "Mississauga" exchange despite the city's incorporation in 1973).

This individual exchange, MALTON22CG1, serves multiple rate centres with different local calling areas for each. It is located 1800 metres west of the boundary between Toronto and Mississauga, serving a major [[YYZ|international airport]] (in Mississauga) and that airport's hotel strip (directly across the town line, therefore in Toronto). Callers from [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]] would be a local call to the hotels but long-distance to the airport itself, even though both destinations are served by the same physical [[Digital Multiplex System]] switch.

This CLLI code identifies a wire centre (the location of the switch) only. A similar exchange on the other side of the town line (such as TOROON29DS0, located 900 metres east of Toronto's western city limits at 40 Old Burnhamthorpe Road, [[Etobicoke]] and serving multiple rate centres) would be issued a Toronto CLLI to reflect the location of the switch itself, but follow the same pattern of a more restrictive calling area for individual subscribers outside city limits. Wire centre CLLI codes therefore do not suffice to identify a rate centre or V/H co-ordinates for toll billing; any +1-416 numbers are billed as if they were in downtown Toronto.

'''WFISON15RS0'''
* WFIS = [[Wolfe Island, Ontario|Wolfe Island]]
* ON = Ontario
* 15 = The +1-613-385 exchange (in this instance, the only local exchange).
* RS0 = An automated [[DMS-100#Remote Cluster Controller|remote switching centre]] (RSC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.localcallingguide.com/lca_prefix.php?switch=WFISON15RS0 WFISON15RS0 on localcallingguide.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 	 	

This is an unattended, automated remote switch housed in a small, square windowless brick building on a side street in [[Frontenac Islands#Communities|Marysville]] village. It serves about 1400 people on Wolfe and [[Simcoe Island]]s in the [[Thousand Islands]].

A Remote Switching Centre (RSC) has limited capability. It can operate autonomously to connect calls within the same exchange, but otherwise relies entirely on control via a single uplink to a host office (in this case, mainland  [[Digital Multiplex System]] exchange [[Kingston, Ontario|KGTNON08CG0]]).&lt;ref&gt;Despite the -CG0 suffix, Kingston's "LIberty 8" exchange (+1-613-54x-xxxx) is a [[Nortel]] [[DMS-100]] per [http://www.telcodata.us/view-switch-detail-by-clli?clli=KGTNON08CG0 KGTNON08CG0 on telcodata.us]&lt;/ref&gt;

An electronic or digital exchange in a small city surrounded by rural villages most often will act as an upstream host for multiple remote switching centres, one in each local village.

The '''Official Municipality Key''', formerly also known as the Official Municipality Characteristic Number or Municipality Code Number, is a number sequence for the identification of politically independent [[municipality|municipalities]] or [[unincorporated area]]s.  Other classifications for the identification of areas include [[postal code]]s, [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS]] codes or [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS]] codes.

=== Structure ===
The municipality identifier consists of five digits in [[Austria]], which are generated as follows: The {{color|red|'''first digit'''}} designates the number of the Austrian [[States of Austria|state]], the {{color|blue|'''second and third digits'''}} designate the district, and the {{color|green|'''fourth and fifth digits'''}} designate the municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Municipalities|url=http://www.statistik.at/web_en/classifications/regional_breakdown/municipalities/index.html|website=Statistics Austria|publisher=Statistics Austria|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== France ==
See [[Code officiel géographique]].

== Germany ==
In [[Germany]] the Official Municipality Key serves [[statistics|statistical]] purposes and is issued by the statistics offices of individual German [[States of Germany|states]].  The municipality key is to be indicated in instances such as changing residence on the notice of departure or registration documents.  This is done at the registration office in every town's [[city hall (administration)|city hall]].

=== Structure ===
The municipality key consists of eight digits, which are generated as follows: The {{color|red|'''first two numbers'''}} designate the individual German state.  The {{color|blue|'''third digit'''}} designates the government district (in areas without government districts a zero is used instead).  The {{color|green|'''fourth and fifth digits'''}} designate the number of the urban area (in a district-free city) or the district (in a city with districts).  The {{color|purple|'''sixth, seventh, and eighth digits'''}} indicate the municipality or the number of the unincorporated area.

==== Examples ====
{{color|red|'''08'''}} {{color|blue|'''1'''}} {{color|green|'''11'''}} {{color|purple|'''000'''}}: [[Stuttgart]]

* {{color|red|'''08'''}}: [[Baden-Württemberg]]
* {{color|blue|'''1'''}}: Government district of Stuttgart
* {{color|green|'''11'''}}: Urban area of Stuttgart
* {{color|purple|'''000'''}}: No other municipality is available, since Stuttgart is an urban area

===Structure===

Usually known as the municipal code or {{va|PSGC code}}, the number comprises nine digits rrppmmbbb, for which rr = region code, pp = province code, {{nowrap|1=mm = city / municipality}} code, bbb = barangay code.

For example, the municipality of [[Ubay, Bohol]] has a code of 071246000 meaning region 07 (Central Visayas), province 12 (Bohol), municipality 46 (Ubay) with barangay code of zero signifying "not at this level." [[Bongbong]], one of its constituent barangays, has a code of 071246007.

The province code is unique and is independent of the region code. All PSGCs, are therefore, unique.

== Sweden ==
A '''kommunkod''' (municipal code) is a numerical code given to all [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipalities]] by the Swedish tax authorities.  The code consists of four digits, the first two indicating which [[counties of Sweden|county]] the municipality is situated in, and the last two specific for the municipality.

The code system was introduced with the municipal reform of 1952. There were three different categories of municipalities at the time, which affected the number that they were allocated. Those with [[Stad (Sweden)|stad]]-status (cities) were given codes ending in 80 to 99, smaller towns ([[köping]]) 60 to 79 and [[Rural municipality|rural municipalities]] 01 to 59. The county seats were allocated codes ending in 80.

As part of the reform in the early 1970s, the categorization of municipalities was abolished, but the code was in most cases preserved. When several municipalities were merged, the code for the biggest municipality was kept.

'''Environmental studies''' is a multidisciplinary academic field which systematically studies [[human behavior|human interaction]] with the [[Natural environment|environment]] in the interests of solving complex problems. Environmental studies brings together the principles of the physical sciences, commerce/economics and social sciences so as to solve contemporary environmental problems. It is a broad field of study that includes the [[natural environment]], the [[built environment]], and the sets of relationships between them. The field encompasses study in basic principles of [[ecology]] and [[environmental science]], as well as associated subjects such as [[environmental ethics|ethics]], [[environmental geography|geography]], [[anthropology]], [[environmental policy|policy]], [[environmental politics|politics]], [[urban planning]], [[environmental law|law]], [[environmental economics|economics]], [[environmental philosophy|philosophy]], [[environmental sociology|sociology]] and [[environmental justice|social justice]], [[environmental planning|planning]], [[pollution control]] and [[natural resource management]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Center for Education Statistics]].

Institute of Education Sciences, [[United States Department of Education]]. [Accessed 29 January 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many degree programs in Environmental Studies including the [[Master's degree|Master of Environmental Studies]] and the [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor of Environmental Studies]].

==History==
The [[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry|New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University]] established a BS in environmental studies degree in the 1950s, awarding its first degree in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/es/about.htm "About Environmental Studies at ESF,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031236/http://www.esf.edu/es/about.htm |date=1 December 2017 }} SUNY-ESF website.

The [[Environmental Studies Association of Canada]] (ESAC) was established in 1993 "to further research and teaching activities in areas related to environmental studies in Canada".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esac.ca/about/a-brief-history-of-esac/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128074556/http://esac.ca/about/a-brief-history-of-esac/ |archivedate=28 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }} "A Brief History of ESAC". Accessed 12 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ESAC's magazine, ''[[A\J: Alternatives Journal]]'' was first published by [[Robert A. Paehlke]] on 4 July 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternativesjournal.ca/magazines/summer-1971-11 ''Alternatives''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106014646/http://www.alternativesjournal.ca/magazines/summer-1971-11 |date=6 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternativesjournal.ca/the-alternatives-story "The Alternatives Story"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106020749/http://www.alternativesjournal.ca/the-alternatives-story |date=6 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Association for Environmental Studies and Sciences]] (AESS) was founded in 2008 as the first professional association in the interdisciplinary field of environmental studies in the United States. In 2010, the National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE) agreed to advise and support the Association. The Association's scholarly journal, the ''Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences'' (JESS), commenced publication in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aess.info|title=Association for Environmental Studies &amp; Sciences AESSonline.org|author=|date=|website=AESSOnline.org|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310034932/http://aess.info/|archivedate=10 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History and Development of AESS|url=https://aessonline.org/about-aess/history/|website=Association for Environmental Studies and Sciences|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106060958/https://aessonline.org/about-aess/history/|archivedate=6 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, many high school students are able to take environmental science as a college-level course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-environmental-science|title=AP Environmental Science|publisher=''Collegeboard|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 500 colleges and universities in the United States offer environmental studies as a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/majors/natural-resources-conservation-environmental-studies|title=Major: Environmental Studies|publisher=''Collegeboard''|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Far East''' is a geographical term in [[English language|English]] that usually refers to [[East Asia]] (including [[Northeast Asia]]), the [[Russian Far East]] (part of [[North Asia]]), and [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/fareast?view=uk|title=Oxford Dictionaries - Dictionary, Thesaurus, &amp; Grammar|work=askoxford.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Asia]] is sometimes also included for economic and cultural reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feer.com/ The 'Far Eastern Economic Review' for example covers news from India and Sri Lanka.]&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Far East" came into use in [[Europe]]an geopolitical discourse in the 12th century, denoting the Far East as the "farthest" of the three "easts", beyond the [[Near East]] and the [[Middle East]]. Likewise, in [[Qing Dynasty]] of the 19th and early 20th centuries the term "[[Far West (Taixi)|Tàixī]] ({{lang|zh|泰西}})" – i.e. anything further west than the [[Arab world]] – was used to refer to the [[Western world|Western]] countries.

Since the 1960s, East Asia has become the most common term for the region in international [[mass media]] outlets.&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15213613|title=A menagerie of monikers|date=7 January 2010|accessdate=9 July 2011|publisher=[[The Economist]]|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reischauer 1960"&gt;Reischauer, Edwin and John K Fairbank, ''East Asia: The Great Tradition,'' 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popularization ==
Prior to the colonial era, "Far East" referred to anything further east than the Middle East. In the 16th century, [[King John III of Portugal]] called [[India]] a "rich and interesting country in the Far East&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Forgotten Empire: Vijayanagar; A Contribution to the History of India|author=Robert Sewell|year=1901}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Extremo Oriente'')." The term was popularized during the period of the [[British Empire]] as a blanket term for lands to the east of [[British Raj|British India]].

In pre-[[World War I]] European geopolitics, the ''[[Near East]]'' referred to the relatively nearby lands of the [[Ottoman Empire]], the ''[[Middle East]]'' denoted northwestern [[South Asia]] and [[Central Asia]], and the ''Far East'' meant countries along the western [[Pacific Ocean]] and eastern [[Indian Ocean]]. Many European languages have analogous terms, such as the [[French language|French]] (''{{lang|fr|[[:fr:Extrême-Orient|Extrême-Orient]]}}''), [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (''{{lang|es|[[:es:Extremo Oriente|Extremo Oriente]]}}''), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (''{{lang|pt|[[:pt:Extremo Oriente|Extremo Oriente]]}}''), [[German language|German]] (''{{lang|de|[[:de:Ferner Osten|Ferner Osten]]}}''), [[Italian language|Italian]] (''{{lang|it|[[:it:Estremo Oriente|Estremo Oriente]]}}''), [[Polish language|Polish]] (''{{lang|pl|[[:pl:Daleki Wschód|Daleki Wschód]]}}''), [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] (''{{lang|no|[[:no:Det fjerne Østen|Det fjerne Østen]]}}'') and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (''{{lang|nl|[[:nl:Verre Oosten|Verre Oosten]]}}'').

== Cultural as well as geographic meaning ==
{{main|East Asian cultural sphere}}

Significantly, the term evokes cultural as well as geographic separation; the ''Far East'' is not just geographically distant, but also culturally exotic. It never refers, for instance, to the culturally Western nations of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], which lie even farther to the east of Europe than East Asia itself. This combination of cultural and geographic subjectivity was well illustrated in 1939 by [[Robert Menzies]], a [[Prime Minister of Australia]]. Reflecting on his country's geopolitical concerns with the onset of [[World War II|war]], Menzies commented that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; The problems of the Pacific are different. What Great Britain calls the Far East is to us the Near North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.dfat.gov.au/info/historical/HistDocs.nsf/(LookupVolNoNumber)/2~73|title=Historical documents|website=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Far East'' in its usual sense is comparable to terms such as ''the [[Orient]]'', which means [[East]]; the ''[[Eastern world]]''; or simply the ''East''. [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Russian Far East]], and occasionally the [[Indian Subcontinent]] might be included in the Far East to some extent.

Concerning the term, John K. Fairbank and Edwin O. Reischauer, professors of East Asian Studies at [[Harvard University]], wrote (in ''East Asia: The Great Tradition''): "When Europeans traveled far to the east to reach [[Cathay]], Japan and the Indies, they naturally gave those distant regions the general name 'Far East.' Americans who reached China, Japan and Southeast Asia by sail and steam across the Pacific could, with equal logic, have called that area the 'Far West.' For the people who live in that part of the world, however, it is neither 'East' nor 'West' and certainly not 'Far.' A more generally acceptable term for the area is 'East Asia,' which is geographically more precise and does not imply the outdated notion that Europe is the center of the civilized world."&lt;ref name="Reischauer 1960"/&gt;

Today, the term remains in the names of some longstanding institutions, including the [[Far Eastern Federal University]] in [[Vladivostok]], [[Far Eastern University]] in [[Manila]], and the [[Far East University (Korea)|Far East University]] in [[South Korea]]. Furthermore, the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]] have historically used ''Far East'' for several military units and commands in the region:

'''Geo-Enable''' is a [[neologism]], a [[portmanteau]] of [[Geospatial]] or [[Geographic]] and [[Enablement (disambiguation)|Enablement]]. Associated words include Geo-Enablment and Geo-Enabling.

As a verb it is increasingly used in the fields of [[Geographic Information System]] (GIS), Web Development, Mobility, [[Information Management]] (IM) and [[Information technology|IT]]. Similar to the terms 'Web-Enabled' or 'GPS-Enabled' - 'Geo-Enable' suggests the application of location or geospatial information as part of business processes or using 'location intelligence' to augment non-spatial [[information systems]] and/or [[Business Intelligence]] (BI).

Geospatial Enablement can be thought of as the integrated use of Geographic Information, as opposed to using Geographic Information within a geographic and technology-centric environment of something such as a [[GPS]] or GIS.

A definition given by GeoEnable Ltd is:

'Geo-Enablement n.:
1. Embedding and leveraging the power of location and geography within workflows and business processes.
2. The act of deriving and utilising geography within non-spatial information.
3. The state of being enabled using location information.' &lt;ref name="Geo-Enablement"&gt;GeoEnable. ''What is Geo-Enablement?'' GeoEnable Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition by the US Government is:

'To geo-enable is to apply geospatial capabilities to a business process in order to establish the authoritative spatial location of business data, and enable contextual spatial analysis.' &lt;ref name="GeospatialPlatform2010"&gt;US Government. ''Modernization Roadmap for the Geospatial Platform (Version 4.0)''. US Department of the Interior &amp; Federal Geographic Data Committee, March 2011, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geographic information retrieval (GIR)''' or '''geographical information retrieval''' is the augmentation of [[information retrieval]] with geographic information. GIR aims at solving textual queries that include a geographic dimension, such as "What wars were fought in Greece?" or "restaurants in Beirut".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Geographic Information Retrieval|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2047296.2047297|journal = SIGSPATIAL Special|date = 2011-07-01|issn = 1946-7729|pages = 2–4|volume = 3|issue = 2|doi = 10.1145/2047296.2047297|first = Ross|last = Purves|first2 = Christopher|last2 = Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common in GIR to separate the text indexing and analysis from the geographic indexing. [[Semantic similarity]] and [[word-sense disambiguation]] are important components of GIR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The semantics of similarity in geographic information retrieval {{!}} Janowicz {{!}} Journal of Spatial Information Science|url = http://josis.net/index.php/josis/article/viewArticle/26|website = josis.net|accessdate = 2015-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; To identify place names, GIR often relies on [[Gazetteer|gazetteers]].

== GIR architecture ==
GIR involves extracting and resolving the meaning of locations in unstructured text.  This is known as [[Geoparsing]]. After identifying location references in text, a GIR system must index this information for search and retrieval. GIR systems can commonly be broken down into the following stages: [[GeoTagging]], text and geographic indexing, data storage, geographic relevance ranking (with respect to a geographic query) and browsing results (commonly with a map interface).

== GIR systems ==

== Evaluation ==

In 2005 the [[Cross-Language Evaluation Forum]] added a geographic track, GeoCLEF. GeoCLEF was the first [[Text Retrieval Conference|TREC]] style evaluation forum for GIR systems and provided participants a chance to compare systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = GeoCLEF: The CLEF 2005 Cross-Language Geographic Information Retrieval Track Overview|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11878773_101|publisher = Springer Berlin Heidelberg|date = 2005-09-21|isbn = 978-3-540-45697-1|pages = 908-919|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|doi = 10.1007/11878773_101#page-1|language = en|first = Fredric|last = Gey|first2 = Ray|last2 = Larson|first3 = Mark|last3 = Sanderson|first4 = Hideo|last4 = Joho|first5 = Paul|last5 = Clough|first6 = Vivien|last6 = Petras|editor-first = Carol|editor-last = Peters|editor-first2 = Fredric C.|editor-last2 = Gey|editor-first3 = Julio|editor-last3 = Gonzalo|editor-first4 = Henning|editor-last4 = Müller|editor-first5 = Gareth J.

'''Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo''' (1497 – January 3, 1543) was a [[Spanish explorers|Spanish explorer]] born in [[Palma del Río|Palma del Rio]], [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], [[Spain]],&lt;ref name = SDHC&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kramer|first=Wendy|date=Summer-Fall 2016|title=Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, Citizen of Guatemala and native of Palma del Río: New sources from the Sixteenth Century|journal=The Journal of San Diego History|volume=62|issue=3 &amp; 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he is also claimed by tradition as a native of Portugal.&lt;ref name = "was"/&gt; Among other things he was a maritime navigator known for exploring the [[West Coast of North America]] on behalf of the [[Spanish Empire]]. Cabrillo was the first European to navigate the coast of present-day [[California]]. He is best known for his exploration of the coast of California in 1542–1543. Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo served under the command of [[Pánfilo de Narváez]] and aided him in the conquest of Cuba about 1518.

==Nationality==
Cabrillo's nationality{{spaced ndash}}[[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] or [[Spaniards|Spanish]]{{spaced ndash}}has been debated for centuries. He was described as Portuguese by Spanish chronicler [[Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas]]; in his ''Historia General de los hechos de los Castellanos en las Islas y tierra firme del Mar Oceano'', written 60 years after Cabrillo's death, Herrera referred to Cabrillo as ''Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo Português''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hererra y Todesillas|first=Antonio de|title=Historia general de los hechos de los castellanos en las Islas i Tierra firme del Mar Océano|url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-8393.html|date=1601–1615|publisher=En la Empr. Real|location=Madrid}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moriarty|first=James Robert|title=Explorers of the Baja and California Coasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VZULAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Juan+Rodriguez+Cabrillo+Portugues%22&amp;dq=%22Juan+Rodriguez+Cabrillo+Portugues%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAGoVChMI4Yi_9s6IyAIVSJeACh2o5Qdt|year=1978|publisher=Cabrillo Historical Association|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several locations in Portugal claim to be his birthplace (e.g. Lapela (Cabril), Portugal). However, the source for Herrera's description is unknown.

Some historians have long believed that Cabrillo was from Spain, and a set of documents discovered in 2015 gave strength to that opinion. A witness from a 1532 lawsuit, named Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, testified under oath that he was born in Palma de Micergilio (now [[Palma del Río]]), a town in the [[Province of Córdoba (Spain)|province of Córdoba]] in Spain. Other details of the witness's biography match known facts about the explorer.&lt;ref name = SDHC/&gt; A leader of San Diego's Portuguese community cautioned that the new evidence must be carefully evaluated, and requested that copies of the documents be turned over to the Portuguese government for study.&lt;ref name="was"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2015/sep/14/cabrillo-spain-settle-debate/|title=Was Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo from Spain?|date=September 14, 2015|work=San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lapela, in the parish of Cabril and a municipality of [[Montalegre]] ([[Portugal]]), is the region where allegedly the nickname "Cabrilha" originated. It became the surname Cabrilho and was pronounced at the time ''Cabrilhe'' in Galician and ''Cabrillo'' in Spanish, according to the historian João Soares Tavares, biographer of João Rodrigues Cabrilho. The name still exists in Portugal as a surname, and several localities named Cabril in [[Beira Alta Province|Beira Alta]] and neighboring regions as Castro Daire, Viseu or Pampilhosa da Serra have been claimed as Cabrillo's birthplace. In Lapela there is an ancient house where local tradition claims he was born. Local people, and alleged local descendants of branches of his ancient family with the same surname ("Rodrigues Cabrilho"), call the house ''Casa do Galego'' (''House of the Galician'') and ''Casa do Americano'' (''House of the American'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibliotecas.cm-porto.pt/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=133X8551502NK.40541&amp;profile=bmp&amp;uri=link=3100018~!247144~!3100024~!3100022&amp;aspect=subtab13&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=1&amp;source=~!horizon&amp;term=Tavares%2C+Jo%C3%A3o+Soares&amp;index=] João Rodrigues Cabrilho : Um Homem do Barroso? / João Soares Tavares&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Voyages==
Cabrillo shipped for [[Havana]] as a young man and joined forces with [[Hernán Cortés]] in [[Mexico]] (then called [[New Spain]]). Later, his success in mining gold in [[Guatemala]] made him one of the richest of the [[conquistador]]es in Mexico.&lt;ref name = "spartacus" /&gt;  According to his biographer Harry Kelsey, he took an indigenous woman as his common-law wife and sired several children, including at least three daughters.&lt;ref name="spartacus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/WWcabrillo.htm|title=Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo|work=Spartacus Educational|publisher=Schoolnet.com|accessdate=1 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402230021/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/WWcabrillo.htm|archivedate=2 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he married Beatriz Sanchez de Ortega in Seville during a hiatus in Spain. She returned to Guatemala with him and bore him two sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/online_resources/cabrillo.html|title=Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo (? - 1543)|work=San Diego History Center|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabrillo benefited from the [[encomienda]] system that enslaved the Native peoples of the Americas. In Honduras, for example, he broke up families, sending the men to the mines for gold and to the forest to harvest materials he needed for ship building.  The women and girls he gave over to his soldiers and sailors, presumably as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Dozier, Deborah (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

He accompanied Francisco de Orozco to subdue the indigenous [[Mixtec]] people at what would eventually become the city of [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]], in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Voyage of Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo"&gt;{{cite book| title=An Account of the Voyage of Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo|year=1999|publisher=Cabrillo National Monument Foundation|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=0-941032-07-8|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of what Cabrillo did there.

In 1539, [[Francisco de Ulloa]], who had been commissioned by Cortés, discovered the [[Gulf of California]] and reached nearly as far north as the 30th parallel.&lt;ref&gt;Engstrand, Iris, and Harry Kelsey, "Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo and the Building of the San Salvador," ''Mains'l Haul: A Journal of Pacific Maritime History,'' vol. 45, Winter/Spring 2009, pp. 36, 39-40&lt;/ref&gt; Cabrillo was then commissioned by the new [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Viceroy of New Spain]], [[Antonio de Mendoza]], to lead an expedition up the [[West coast of the United States|Pacific coast]] in search of trade opportunities, perhaps to find a way to China (for the full extent of the northern Pacific was unknown) or to find the mythical Strait of Anián (or [[Northwest Passage]]) connecting the Pacific Ocean with [[Hudson Bay]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Cabrillo built and owned the flagship of his venture (two or three ships), and stood to profit from any trade or treasure.&lt;ref&gt;Linder, Bruce, ''San Salvador: Cabrillo's Galleon of Discovery,'' Maritime Museum of San Diego, 2011, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cabrillo National Monument (Loki30).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cabrillo National Monument]] in San Diego, California]]
In 1540 the fleet sailed from [[Acajutla]], [[El Salvador]], and reached [[Barra de Navidad, Jalisco|Navidad, Mexico]] on Christmas Day. While in Mexico, [[Pedro de Alvarado]] went to the assistance of the town of [[Nochistlán]], which was under siege by hostile natives, and was killed when his horse fell on him, crushing his chest. Following Alvarado's death, the viceroy took possession of Alvarado's fleet. Part of the fleet was sent off to the [[Philippine Islands]] under [[Ruy Lopez de Villalobos]] and two of the ships were sent north under the command of Cabrillo.

On June 27, 1542, Cabrillo set out from Navidad with three ships: the 200-ton [[galleon]] and flagship ''[[San Salvador (Cabrillo's ship)|San Salvador]]'', the smaller ''La Victoria'' (c. 100 tons), and the [[lateen]]-rigged, twenty-six oared "fragata" or "bergantin" ''San Miguel''.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsey (1986), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 1, Cabrillo anchored within sight of [[Cedros Island]]. Before the end of the month they had passed Baja Point (named "Cabo del Engaño" by de Ulloa in 1539) and entered "uncharted waters, where no Spanish ships had been before".&lt;ref&gt;Kelsey (1986), pp. 131-33.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 28, he landed in what is now [[San Diego Bay]] and named it "San Miguel".&lt;ref&gt;Kelsey (1986), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; A little over a week later he reached [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Santa Catalina Island]] (October 7), which he named "San Salvador", after his flagship.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsey (1986), pp. 144, 150. Catalina was also called "Capitana", "Juan Rodriquez", or "La Posesión".&lt;/ref&gt; On sending a boat to the island "a great crowd of armed Indians appeared" — whom, however, they later "befriended". Nearby [[San Clemente Island]] was named "Victoria", in honor of the third ship of the fleet. The next morning, October 8, Cabrillo came to [[San Pedro Bay (California)|San Pedro Bay]], which was named "Baya de los Fumos" (English: Smoke Bay). The following day they anchored overnight in [[Santa Monica Bay]]. Going up the coast Cabrillo saw [[Anacapa Island]], which they learned from the Indians was uninhabited. The fleet spent the next week in the islands, mostly anchored in Cuyler Harbor, a bay on the northeastern coast of [[San Miguel Island]]. On October 18 the expedition saw [[Point Conception]], which they named "Cabo de Galera".

Cabrillo's expedition recorded the names of numerous [[Chumash people|Chumash]] villages on the California coast and adjacent islands in October 1542 &amp;mdash; then located in the two warring provinces of ''Xexo'' (ruled by an "old woman", now [[Santa Barbara County, California]]) and ''Xucu'' (now [[Ventura County, California]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

On November 13 they sighted and named "Cabo de Piños" (possibly either [[Point Pinos]] or [[Point Reyes]]), but missed the entrance to [[San Francisco Bay]], a lapse that mariners would repeat for the next two centuries and more. The expedition reached as far north as the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]] before autumn storms forced them to turn back. Coming back down the coast, Cabrillo entered [[Monterey Bay]], naming it "Bahia de Los Piños".&lt;ref&gt;Kelsey (1986), pp. 145-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 23, 1542, the little fleet arrived back in "San Salvador" (Santa Catalina Island) to overwinter and make repairs. There, around Christmas Eve, Cabrillo stepped out of his boat and splintered his shin when he stumbled onto a jagged rock while trying to rescue some of his men from attacking [[Tongva]] warriors. The injury became infected and developed [[gangrene]], and he died on January 3, 1543 and was buried. A possible headstone was later found on San Miguel Island. His second-in-command brought the remainder of the party back to Navidad, where they arrived April 14, 1543.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsey (1986), p. 159, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

A notary's official report of Cabrillo's expedition was lost; all that survives is a summary of it made by another investigator, [[Andrés de Urdaneta]], who also had access to ships' logs and charts.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} No printed account of Cabrillo's voyage appeared before historian Antonio de Herrera's account early in the 17th century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

His discoveries went largely unnoticed at the time, so none of his place names were permanently adopted. Despite this, Cabrillo is now remembered as the first European to travel the California coast, and many parks, schools, buildings and streets in California bear his name.

Most notably, the [[National Park Service]] operates [[Cabrillo National Monument]], overlooking the bay and ocean from [[Point Loma, San Diego|Point Loma]] in [[San Diego]], commemorating his first landing in California and offering views of San Diego and the Pacific Ocean. The monument features a larger-than-life statue of Cabrillo, donated by the government of [[Portugal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20080803/news_lz1mc3cabrill.html|title=Cabrillo statue's journey to San Diego marked by legal twists|last=Crawford|first=Richard|date=August 3, 2008|work=San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a plaque honoring him donated in 1935 by the Portuguese ambassador to the United States.&lt;ref name="Rowe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/oct/13/cabrillo-monument-hundred/|title=Cabrillo National Monument at 100|last=Rowe|first=Peter|date=October 13, 2013|work=San Diego Union-Tribune|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A museum in the park focuses on Cabrillo and his voyages of discovery. Every September Cabrillo Festival Inc. hosts the Cabrillo Festival, an annual three-day celebration of his discovery of [[San Diego Bay]], including a re-enactment of his landing at Ballast Point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cabrillofestival.org/|title=Cabrillo Festival|work=Cabrillo National Monument|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabrillofestival.org Cabrillo Festival Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[SS Cabrillo|SS ''Cabrillo'']] was a wooden steamer launched in 1914 to serve as a ferry across the San Pedro Channel to Santa Catalina Island. It was later requisitioned by the United States Army and served as a troop transport in northern California during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://napavalleyregister.com/news/local/the-ghost-ship-of-carneros/article_3b176ba7-93f2-5cd7-9094-87c472667e8c.html|title=The ghost ship of Carneros|last=Courtney|first=Kevin|date=September 13, 2009|work=Napa Valley Register|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==San Salvador replica==
The [[Maritime Museum of San Diego]], in partnership with [[Cabrillo National Monument]], has built a full-sized, fully functional, and historically accurate replica of Juan Rodriquez Cabrillo’s flagship, ''[[San Salvador (Cabrillo's ship)|San Salvador]]''. The construction of the replica was based on historical and archeological research into early Spanish and Portuguese shipbuilding techniques.

The construction was carried out in full public view on the shores of San Diego Bay by professional boat builders, assisted by scores of volunteers. Her keel was laid in April 2011; her first official public unveiling was in September 2015 when she led a parade of tall ships. The replica ship now sails on regular tours in the waters of the [[Southern California]] coast as an educational historical resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sdmaritime.org/visit/the-ships/san-salvador/|title=San Salvador|work=Maritime Museum of San Diego|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A LIS consists of an accurate, current and reliable land record [[cadastre]] and its associated attribute and spatial data that represent the legal boundaries of land tenure and provides a vital base layer capable of integration into other geographic systems or as a standalone solution that allows data stewards to retrieve, create, update, store, view, analyze and publish land information.

== Importance ==
# Land parcel is the basic unit for access and control of land, land use decisions. 
# Current, reliable land information necessary for many public programs: land planning, infrastructure development and maintenance, environmental protection and resource management, emergency services, social service programs and so forth. 
# LIS provides a base for land markets, development, and other economic activity. 
# LIS helps in updating of the maps.

'''Land systems''' constitute the terrestrial component of the Earth system and encompass all processes and activities related to the human use of land, including socioeconomic, technological and organizational investments and arrangements, as well as the benefits gained from land and the unintended social and ecological outcomes of societal activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Verburg|first=Peter H|last2=Erb|first2=Karl-Heinz|last3=Mertz|first3=Ole|last4=Espindola|first4=Giovana|date=2013-10-01|title=Land System Science: between global challenges and local realities|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343513000936|journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability|series=Human settlements and industrial systems|volume=5|issue=5|pages=433–437|doi=10.1016/j.cosust.2013.08.001|pmc=4018982|pmid=24851141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes  in land systems have large consequences for the local environment and human well-being and are at the same time pervasive factors of global environmental change. Land provides vital resources to society, such as food, fuel, fibres and many other [[ecosystem services]] that support production functions, regulate risks of natural hazards, or provide cultural and spiritual services.  By using the land, society alters and modifies the quantity and quality of the provision of these services.

Land system changes are the direct result of human decision making at multiple scales ranging from local land owners decisions to national scale land use planning and global trade agreements. The aggregate impact of many local land system changes has far reaching consequences for the Earth System, that feedback on ecosystem services, human well-being and decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crossman|first=Neville D|last2=Bryan|first2=Brett A|last3=de Groot|first3=Rudolf S|last4=Lin|first4=Yu-Pin|last5=Minang|first5=Peter A|date=2013-10-01|title=Land science contributions to ecosystem services|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343513000729|journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability|series=Human settlements and industrial systems|volume=5|issue=5|pages=509–514|doi=10.1016/j.cosust.2013.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, land system change is both a cause and consequence of socio-ecological processes.

'''Levelling''' ([[British English]]) or '''leveling''' ([[American English]]); is a branch of [[surveying]], the object of which is to establish or verify or measure the height of specified points relative to a datum. It is widely used in  [[cartography]] to measure [[Geodetic system|geodetic]] [[height]], and in [[construction]] to measure height differences of construction artifacts.

==Optical levelling==
[[Image:Baak.svg|thumb|right|Stadia marks on a crosshair while viewing a metric [[levelling rod]]. The top mark is at 1.5 m and the lower is at 1.345 m. The distance between the marks is 0.155 m, yielding a distance to the rod of 15.5 m.]]Optical levelling  employs an [[optical level]],which consists of a precision telescope with [[crosshair]]s and [[Stadia mark]]s. The cross hairs are used to establish the level point on the target, and the stadia allow range-finding; stadia are usually at ratios of 100:1, in which case one metre between the stadia marks on the levelling staff represents 100 metres from the target.
The complete unit is normally mounted on a [[Tripod (surveying)|tripod]], and the telescope can freely rotate 360° in a horizontal plane. The surveyor adjusts the instrument's level by coarse adjustment of the tripod legs and fine adjustment using three precision levelling screws on the instrument to make the rotational plane horizontal. The surveyor does this with the use of a [[Bull's eye level|bull's eye]] [[spirit level|level]] built into the instrument mount.
The surveyor looks through the eyepiece of telescope while an assistant holds a vertical [[Level staff|level staff]] which is a graduated in inches or centimeters. The level staff is placed with its foot on the  point for which the level measurement is required. The telescope is rotated and focused until the level staff is plainly visible in the crosshairs. In the case of a high accuracy manual level, the fine level adjustment is made by an altitude screw, using a high accuracy bubble level fixed to the telescope. This can be viewed by a mirror whilst adjusting or the ends of the bubble can be displayed within the telescope, which also allows assurance of the accurate level of the telescope whilst the sight is being taken. However, in the case of an automatic level, altitude adjustment is done automatically by a suspended prism due to gravity, as long as the coarse levelling is accurate within certain limits. When level, the staff graduation reading at the crosshairs is recorded, and an identifying mark or marker placed where the level staff rested on the object or position being surveyed.

==Linear levelling procedure==
[[File:NivellementExample.svg|thumb|Diagram showing relationship between two level staff, or rods, shown as 1 and 3. The level line of sight is 2.]]

A typical procedure for a linear track of levels from a known datum is as follows. Set up the instrument within {{convert|100|m|yd|abbr=off}} of a point of known or assumed elevation. A rod or staff is held vertical on that point and the instrument is used manually or automatically to read the rod scale. This gives the height of the instrument above the starting (backsight) point and allows the height of the instrument (H.I.) above the datum to be computed.
The rod is then held on an unknown point and a reading is taken in the same manner, allowing the elevation of the new (foresight) point to be computed. The procedure is repeated until the destination point is reached. It is usual practice to perform either a complete loop back to the starting point or else close the traverse on a second point whose elevation is already known. The closure check guards against blunders in the operation, and allows residual error to be distributed in the most likely manner among the stations.

Some instruments provide three crosshairs which allow [[Stadia mark|stadia]] measurement of the foresight and backsight distances. These also allow use of the average of the three readings (3-wire leveling) as a check against blunders and for averaging out the error of interpolation between marks on the rod scale.

The two main types of levelling are single-levelling as already described, and double-levelling (Double-rodding). In double-levelling, a surveyor takes two foresights and two backsights and makes sure the difference between the foresights and the difference between the backsights are equal, thereby reducing the amount of error.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Ira Osborn Baker|title=Leveling: Barometric, Trigonometric and Spirit|page=126|publisher=D. Van Nostrand|year=1887|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SXIOAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22single+leveling%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Double-levelling costs twice as much as single-levelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Guy Bomford|title=Geodesy|publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]|edition=4th|page=204|year=1980|isbn=0-19-851946-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4hAJAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22single+levelling%22&amp;dq=%22single+levelling%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Turning a level===

When using an optical level, the endpoint may be out of the effective range of the instrument. There may be obstructions or large changes of elevation between the endpoints. In these situations, extra setups are needed. Turning is a term used when referring to moving the level to take an elevation shot from a different location.

To "turn" the level, one must first take a reading and record the elevation of the point the rod is located on. While the rod is being kept in exactly the same location, the level is moved to a new location where the rod is still visible. A reading is taken from the new location of the level and the height difference is used to find the new elevation of the level gun. This is repeated until the series of measurements is completed.

The level must be horizontal to get a valid measurement. Because of this, if the horizontal crosshair of the instrument is lower than the base of the rod, the surveyor will not be able to sight the rod and get a reading. The rod can usually be raised up to 25 feet high, allowing the level to be set much higher than the base of the rod.

==Refraction and curvature==
The curvature of the earth means that a line of sight that is horizontal at the instrument will be higher and higher above a spheroid at greater distances. The effect may be significant for some work at distances under 100 meters.

The line of sight is horizontal at the instrument, but is not a straight line because of refraction in the air. The change of air density with elevation causes the line of sight to bend toward the earth.

The combined correction for refraction and curvature is approximately:&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Foote, and Kelly, Surveying Theory and Practice, 1966 p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta h_{meters} = 0.067 D_{km} ^2 &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \Delta h_{feet} = 0.021 \left(\frac {D_{ft}}{1000} \right)^2 &lt;/math&gt; 
For precise work these effects need to be calculated and corrections applied. For most work it is sufficient to keep the foresight and backsight distances approximately equal so that the refraction and curvature effects cancel out. Refraction is generally the greatest source of error in leveling. For short level lines the effects of temperature and pressure are generally insignificant, but the effect of the temperature gradient ''dT / dh'' can lead to errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Guy Bomford|title=Geodesy|publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]|place=Oxford | edition=4th | page=222|year=1980|isbn=0-19-851946-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4hAJAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22single+levelling%22&amp;dq=%22single+levelling%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Levelling loops and gravity variations==

Assuming error-free measurements, if the Earth's gravity field were completely regular and gravity constant, leveling loops would always close precisely:

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=0}^n \Delta h_i = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

around a loop. In the real gravity field of the Earth, this happens only approximately; on small loops typical of engineering projects, the loop closure is negligible, but on larger loops covering regions or continents it is not.

Instead of height differences, ''geopotential differences'' do close around loops:

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=0}^n \Delta h_i g_i, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt; stands for gravity at the leveling interval ''i''. For precise leveling networks on a national scale, the latter formula should always be used.

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta W_i = \Delta h_i g_i\ &lt;/math&gt;

should be used in all computations, producing geopotential values &lt;math&gt;W_i&lt;/math&gt; for the [[benchmark (surveying)|benchmark]]s of the network.

===Older instruments===

[[File:SAM PC 1 - Levelling instrument Kern+Co. 1890.jpg|thumb|A "Y" level. The telescope can be removed and reversed or rotated to remove errors.]] The wye level is the oldest and bulkiest of the older style optical instruments. A low-powered telescope is placed in a pair of clamp mounts, and the instrument then leveled using a [[spirit level]], which is mounted parallel to the main telescope.

The [[dumpy level]] was developed by English civil engineer [[William Gravatt]], while surveying the route of a proposed railway line from London to Dover. More compact and hence both more robust and easier to transport, it is commonly believed that dumpy levelling is less accurate than other types of levelling, but such is not the case. Dumpy levelling requires shorter and therefore more numerous sights, but this fault is compensated by the practice of making foresights and backsights equal.

Precise level designs were often used for large leveling projects where utmost accuracy was required. They differ from other levels in having a very precise spirit level tube and a micrometer adjustment to raise or lower the line of sight so that the crosshair can be made to coincide with a line on the rod scale and no interpolation is required.

===Automatic level===
Automatic levels make use of a compensator that ensures that the line of sight remains horizontal once the operator has roughly leveled the instrument (to within maybe 0.05 degree). The surveyor sets the instrument up quickly and doesn't have to relevel it carefully each time he sights on a rod on another point. It also reduces the effect of minor settling of the tripod to the actual amount of motion instead of leveraging the tilt over the sight distance. Three level screws are used to level the instrument.

===Laser level===
{{Main|Laser level}}
Laser levels &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=John S. Scott|title=Dictionary of Civil Engineering|page=252|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|year=1992|isbn=0-412-98421-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7oIHQDDrxsC&amp;dq=%22laser+levelling%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; project a beam which is visible and/or detectable by a sensor on the leveling rod. This style is widely used in construction work but not for more precise control work. An advantage is that one person can perform the levelling independently, whereas other types require one person at the instrument and one holding the rod.

The sensor can be mounted on earth-moving machinery to allow automated grading.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20697">This is a '''list of IATA-indexed railway stations''', which are assigned codes by the [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]], similar to [[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA airport codes]]. Such [[railway stations]] are typically used in [[air-rail alliance]]s or code sharing agreements (commonly known as "Rail Fly") between [[airlines]] and rail lines, particularly in Europe. By assigning railway stations an IATA code, passengers on trips involving those stations can be ticketed all the way. Sometimes they can get checked straight through to their final destination, without the bother of having to claim their baggage and check-in again when changing between the rail and air portions of a trip. At other places passengers have to carry their baggage on the train, but anyway need no separate train booking process.

==Railway station codes==
The IATA codes for railway stations normally begin with '''Q''', '''X''' or '''Z''', except when the station shares the code with an airport. For some smaller cities the railway station in the city has the same code as the airport outside the city (several kilometers distance). A connection involving transfer between them can appear when searching travel possibilities. A taxi ride, a train, or a bus transfer is usually needed then.

The '''world's longest above-water mountain range''' is the [[Andes]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/andes.htm ''Andes Mountains''  by Alan W./Knapp Gregory. 1999] Retrieve 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Windows to Universe [http://www.windows2universe.org/geography/andes.html ''The Andes Mountains'' by: Julia Genyuk.] Retrieve 17 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; about {{convert|7,000|km|abbr=on}}  long. The range stretches from north to south through seven countries in [[South America]], along the west coast of the continent: [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], and [[Argentina]]. [[Aconcagua]] is the highest peak, at about {{convert|6,962|m|abbr=on}}. 

This list does not include submarine mountain ranges. If submarine mountains are included, the longest is the global [[mid-ocean ridge]] system which extends for about {{convert|65,000|km|abbr=on}}.

==Formation==
Mountain chains are typically formed by the process of [[plate tectonics]]. [[Tectonic plate]]s slide very slowly over the [[Earth]]'s [[mantle (geology)|mantle]], a lower place of rock that is heated from the Earth's interior. Several huge sections of the earth’s crust are impelled by heat currents in the mantle, producing tremendous forces that can buckle the material at the edges of the plates to form [[mountain]]s. Usually one plate is forced underneath the other, and the lower plate is slowly absorbed by the mantle. Where the two plates pass one another, heated [[Rock (geology)|rock]] from the mantle can burst through the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] to form [[volcano]]es. The movement of the plates against one another can also cause [[earthquake]]s.

The '''North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition''', also known as the '''Rodgers-Ringgold Expedition''' was a United States scientific and exploring project from 1853 to 1856. 

Commander [[Cadwalader Ringgold]] (1802&amp;ndash;1867) led the expedition until he was relieved of command in [[Hong Kong]] by a commission convened by Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]]. Lt. [[John Rodgers (naval officer, Civil War)|John Rodgers]] (1812&amp;ndash;1882) then commanded the expedition until its conclusion.

==The expedition under Ringgold==
[[Image:Commodore Cadwalader Ringgold.jpg|thumb|left|upright |[[Cadwalader Ringgold]] ]]
Ringgold sailed on [[USS Porpoise (1836)|USS ''Porpoise'']], a ship he had commanded during the [[U.S. Exploring Expedition]] years before. [[USS John Hancock (1850)|USS ''John Hancock'']], commanded by Lt. [[John Rodgers (naval officer, Civil War)|John Rodgers]] and three other vessels including [[USS Vincennes (1826)|USS ''Vincennes'']] would be the other vessels in the expedition.

''Porpoise'' joined the squadron at Hampton Roads, and with it, stood out to sea 11 June 1853. After stopping at [[Funchal]], [[Madeira Islands]]; [[Porto Praya]]; and [[Simonstown]], [[False Bay]]; the expedition arrived [[Jakarta|Batavia]], [[Java (island)|Java]], 12 December and in [[China]] in March 1854. 

Five months were devoted to surveying the waters surrounding the large islands off the coast of Southeast Asia. Early in May 1854, ''John Hancock'', with Rodgers commanding, departed for [[Hong Kong]], where she arrived 24 May. The squadron operated from that port as its base throughout the summer, surveying nearby coasts, islands and rivers. At this time [[China]] was plagued by rebellion and [[pirate]]s endangering foreigners and threatening their property. The American ships helped protect American citizens and interests. While steaming up the [[Pearl River (China)|Canton River]], two armed boats from ''John Hancock'' were fired upon by rebel batteries, which ''Hancock'''s cannon promptly silenced.

==From Hong Kong to the United States==

In July 1854, Ringgold became sick with malaria and was sent home, according to at least one source.&lt;ref name=fraser&gt;[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst;jsessionid=FvPM4s2QZ207lH0LK4PgT4g5LlKhs6gCQ1xQ1GqhpZC1lPQMQKQR!15464514?a=o&amp;d=5002380544 Questia.com] Questia Online Library Web site copy of: Houston, Alan Fraser, "Cadwalader Ringgold, U. S. Navy" an article in ''California History'' magazine, Volume 79, Issue 4, Winter 2000, page 208, Web site accessed October 19, 2006, Footnote 11&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nathaniel Philbrick, in his book "Sea of Glory" about the U.S. Exploring Expedition, writes that in the later expedition Ringgold "began to act strangely" once in China, keeping his ships in port "ceaselessly repairing his vessels". Commodore Perry, on his own expedition, sailed in and convened an official panel which relieved Ringgold from command of the expedition and sent him home. Philbrick quotes Perry as declaring Ringgold "insane."&lt;ref&gt;Philbrick, Nathaniel, ''Sea of Glory: America's voyage of discovery, The U.S. Exploring Expedition, 1838-1842'' (Viking: 2003), {{ISBN|0-670-03231-X}} pages 351,-352&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Rodgers (naval officer, Civil War)|John Rodgers]] was given full command of the expedition and completed it.

The squadron headed north along the coast as far as the [[Bering Sea]], surveying as it went.
The squadron at that time also explored islands well off the coast of Asia, including the [[Bonins]], the [[Mariana Islands|Ladrones]], and the [[Marianas]]. ''Porpoise'' parted company with the other vessels 21 September 1854 between [[Taiwan|Formosa]] and China, and was never heard from again. It is supposed that she foundered in a heavy typhoon which occurred a few days after her separation from the squadron.

At the Bering sea, the expedition turned south along the western coast of North America. In March 1856, the expedition arrived at [[Puget Sound]] to help suppress Indian uprisings which threatened to wipe out white settlements and Army outposts established in the early 1850s.

==Results of the expedition==
Besides greatly increasing knowledge of the western and northern Pacific, stimulating commerce, and easing navigation in previously unknown seas, the expedition has been credited with helping to establish friendly relations between the United States and several nations of East Asia.

A '''notice to mariners''' (NTM&lt;ref&gt;Web site uses abbreviation NTM&lt;/ref&gt;) advises mariners of important matters affecting navigational safety, including new [[Hydrography|hydrographic information]], changes in [[channel (geography)|channel]]s and aids to [[navigation]], and other important data.

Over 60 countries which produce nautical charts also
produce a notice to mariners. About one third of these are
weekly, another third are bi-monthly or monthly, and the
rest irregularly issued according to need. For example, the [[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office]] issues weekly updates.

==United States==

The U.S. ''Notice to Mariners'' is made available weekly by the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA), prepared jointly with the [[National Ocean Service]] (NOS) and the [[U.S. Coast Guard]]. The information in the ''Notice to Mariners'' is formatted to simplify the correction of [[nautical chart|paper charts]], ''[[List of Lights]]'', ''[[Light List]]s'', ''[[United States Coast Pilots]]'', and other publications produced by NGA, NOS, and the U.S. Coast Guard.

Information for the ''Notice to Mariners'' is contributed
by: the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (Department of Defense) for waters
outside the territorial limits of the United States; National
Ocean Service ([[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]],
[[Department of Commerce]]), which is charged
with surveying and charting the coasts and harbors of the
United States and its territories; the U.S. Coast Guard ([[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]) which is responsible for the safety of life at sea and the establishment and operation of aids to navigation; and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] ([[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]), which is charged with the
improvement of rivers and harbors of the United States. In
addition, important contributions are made by foreign hydrographic
offices and cooperating observers of all
nationalities.

The Notice consists of a page of Hydrograms listing
important items in the Notice, a chart correction
section organized by ascending chart number, a product catalog corrections section, a publications
correction section, a summary of broadcast
navigation warnings, and a page of additional miscellaneous information. It is the responsibility of users to decide which of their
charts and publications require correction.
Mariners are requested to cooperate in the correction of
charts and publications by reporting all discrepancies between
published information and conditions actually
observed and by recommending appropriate improvements. A reporting form is provided in the back of each
''Notice to Mariners''.

Issue No. 1 of each year contains important
information on a variety of subjects which supplements
information not usually found on charts and in navigational
publications. This information is published as Special Notice
to Mariners Paragraphs. Additional items considered
of interest to the mariner are also included in this Notice.

Much of the data
in the U.S. ''Notice to Mariners'' is obtained from foreign
notices.

==Canada==
In Canada, the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/ Notice to Mariners] publication informs mariners of important navigational safety matters affecting Canadian Waters.  This electronic publication is published on a monthly basis and can be downloaded from the [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/go.php?doc=eng/services/notmar/index Notices to Mariners (NOTMAR) Web site].  The information in the Notice to Mariners is formatted to simplify the correction of paper charts and navigational publications.

The [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/ NOTMAR.gc.ca] site is a free 24/7 service providing mariners with up-to-date safety advisories.   It provides mariners with a quick and easy to use interface to access Notices to Mariners information. This system also generates [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/search/mycharts-eng.php?czozMDoibnRtPXN0ZXBfb25lc3RhcnQmYWNjZXB0cHJpdj0xIjs= weekly and monthly notification mailers], for its registered users.  These on-line mail services provides the [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/subscribe/ monthly Notices to Mariners publications] as well as the weekly(section II - chart corrections) notices that advise the mariner of the notices that have been issued against their chart selections.  These mail services simplify the process for registered clients to update their publications and charts as required under the Canada Shipping Act.

The NOTMAR web site also includes the [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/go.php?doc=eng/services/notmar/numindex historical Chart corrections] and [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/go.php?doc=eng/services/notmar/sec4index historical Sailing Direction corrections]; as well, it provides access to downloadable Chart Patches, contains links to CHS’s Chart Number 1, instructions for applying Notices to mariners to manually update their paper charts, and other useful information.

==Summary of Corrections==
A close companion to the ''Notice to Mariners'' is the '''[http://msi.nga.mil/MSISiteContent/StaticFiles/SOCDownloadPage.htm Summary of Corrections]'''. The ''Summary'' is published in five volumes. Each volume covers a major portion of the earth including several chart regions and many subregions.  Volume 5 also includes special charts and publications corrected
by the ''Notice to Mariners''. Since the Summaries contain cumulative corrections, any chart, regardless of its print date, can be corrected with the proper volume of the Summary and all subsequent ''Notice to Mariners''.

Studies show that [[human error]] is a factor in 80 percent of navigational accidents and that in many cases the human making the error had access to information that could have prevented the accident.&lt;ref name="annex24"/&gt;  The practice of voyage planning has evolved from penciling lines on [[nautical chart]]s to a process of [[risk management]].&lt;ref name="annex24"/&gt;

==Planning stages==
[[File:Cruising sailor navigating.jpg|thumb|Monitoring progress and comparing it to the plan are key to passage planning.]]
Passage planning consists of four stages: appraisal, planning, execution, and monitoring.&lt;ref name="annex24"/&gt;  These stages are specified in ''[[International Maritime Organization]] Resolution A.893(21), Guidelines For Voyage Planning,''&lt;ref name="annex25-1"&gt;International Maritime Organization, Section 1 of ''Guidelines for Voyage Planning'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; which are, in turn, reflected in the local laws of IMO signatory countries.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in [[33 CFR|Title 33 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Guidelines'' specify fifty elements of passage planning, some of which are only applicable in certain situations.&lt;ref name="bow367"/&gt;

The ''Guidelines'' specify three key items to consider in the practice of voyage planning:

*having and using a voyage plan is "of essential importance for safety of life at sea, safety and efficiency of navigation and protection of the marine environment,"&lt;ref name="annex25-1"/&gt;
* voyage planning is necessary for all types of vessels on all types of voyages,&lt;ref name="annex25-1"/&gt; and
* the plan's scope should be based on all information available, should be "berth to berth," including when [[harbour pilot|under pilotage]], and the plan includes the execution and the monitoring of progress.&lt;ref name="annex25-1"/&gt;

Voyage planning starts with the appraisal stage.  Before each voyage begins, the navigator should develop a detailed [[mental model]] of how the entire voyage will proceed.&lt;ref name="bow367"&gt;Bowditch 2002, p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt;  The appraisal stage consists of gathering and contemplating all information relevant to the voyage.  Much of this appraisal is done by consulting [[nautical chart]]s, [[nautical publications]] and performing a number of technical tasks such as weather forecasting, prediction of tides and currents, and checks of local regulations and warnings.&lt;ref name="annex25-2"&gt;International Maritime Organization, Section 2 of ''Guidelines for Voyage Planning'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nautical publications are a valuable guide to local conditions and regulations, but they must be updated and actually read to be of any use.&lt;ref name="chap4"&gt;{{cite web
 |title       = Chapter 4, Nautical Publications
 |url         = http://www.irbs.com/bowditch/

 |deadurl     = yes
 |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070624193729/http://www.irbs.com/bowditch/

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These publications could include [[Sailing Directions]] and [[Coast Pilots]] or similar texts produced by other authorities.&lt;ref name="annex25-2"/&gt;

The next stage of the process is known as the planning stage.  Once information is gathered and considered, the navigator can begin the process of actually laying out the voyage.  The process involves projecting various future events including landfalls, narrow passages, and course changes expected during the voyage.&lt;ref name="bow367"/&gt; This mental model becomes the standard by which the navigator measures progress toward the goal of a safe and efficient voyage, and it is manifested in a passage plan.&lt;ref name="bow367"/&gt;

A good passage plan will include a track line laid out upon the best-scale charts available.&lt;ref name="bow267"&gt;Bowditch 2002, p.214.&lt;/ref&gt;  This track is judged with respect to at least nine separate criteria given in the ''Guidelines'' including under-keel clearance, safe speed, air draft, the use of routing and reporting services (TSS and VTS), and the availability of contingencies in case of emergency.&lt;ref name="annex25-3"&gt;International Maritime Organization, Section 3 of ''Guidelines for Voyage Planning'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Navigation system on a merchant ship.jpg|right|thumb|Modern navigators often enter passage plans on [[ECDIS|electronic systems]]]]The navigator will draw and redraw the [[Course (navigation)|track line]] until it is safe, efficient, and in line with all applicable laws and regulations.&lt;ref name="bow367"/&gt;  When the track is finished, it is becoming common practice to also enter it into electronic navigation tools such as an [[Electronic Chart Display and Information System]], a [[chartplotter]], an [[Automatic radar plotting aid|ARPA]] system, or a [[GPS]] unit.&lt;ref name="bow224-225"&gt;Bowditch 2002, pp 224–225.&lt;/ref&gt;

When working in a team environment, the passage plan should be communicated to the navigation team in a pre-voyage conference in order to ensure that all members of the team share the same mental model of the entire trip.&lt;ref name="bow367"/&gt;

The third stage of passage planning is the execution stage.  The IMO was careful to include execution as part of the process of passage planning.  This underscores the fact that the ''Guidelines'' list a number of tasks that are to executed during the course of the voyage.  It also reiterates the captain's responsibility to treat the plan as a "living document" and to review or change it in case of any special circumstances that should arise.&lt;ref name="annex25-4"&gt;International Maritime Organization, Section 4 of ''Guidelines for Voyage Planning'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth and final stage of voyage planning is the monitoring stage.  Once the voyage has begun the progress of the vessel along its planned route must be monitored. This requires that the ship's position be determined, using standard methods including [[dead reckoning]], [[celestial navigation]], [[Maritime pilot|pilotage]], and [[electronic navigation]].

According to the ''Guidelines,'' the passage plan should always be available to the [[deck officer|officer on watch]] on the bridge.  The ''Guidelines'' also specify that deviations from the plan should be clearly recorded and be consistent with other provisions of the ''Guidelines.''&lt;ref name="annex25-5"&gt;International Maritime Organization, Section 5 of ''Guidelines for Voyage Planning'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer aids==
In modern times, computer software can greatly simplify the passage planning process and ensure that nothing important is overlooked.&lt;ref name="bow367"/&gt; Passage planning software may include functions such as waypoint management, distance calculators, tide and tidal current
predictors, celestial navigational calculators, consumables estimators for fuel, oil, water, and stores, and other useful applications.&lt;ref name="bow367"/&gt;

'''Polar exploration''' is the process of [[exploration]] of the [[polar regions]] of the [[Earth]] - the [[Arctic region]] and [[Antarctica]] - particularly with the goal of reaching the [[North Pole]] and [[South Pole]], respectively. Historically, this was accomplished by explorers making often arduous travels on foot or by sled in these regions, known as a '''polar expedition'''. More recently, exploration has been accomplished with technology, particularly with [[satellite imagery]].

From 600 BC to 300 BC [[Greek philosophy|Greek Philosophers]] theorized that the planet was a [[Spherical Earth]] with [[North Pole|North]] and [[South Pole|South]] [[Polar region]]s. By 150 [[Anno Domini|AD]] [[Ptolemy]] published [[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]], which notes a hypothetical [[Terra Australis|Terra Australis Incognita]]. However, due to harsh weather conditions, the poles themselves would not be reached for centuries after that. When they finally were reached, the achievement was realized only a few years apart.

There are two claims, both disputed, about who was the first person to reach the [[geographic North Pole]]. [[Frederick Cook]], accompanied by two [[Inuit]] men, Ahwelah and Etukishook claimed to have reached the Pole on April 21, 1908, although this claim is generally doubted. On April 6, 1909, [[Robert Peary]] claimed to be the first person in recorded history to reach the North Pole,&lt;ref name="arcticchronology"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quarkexpeditions.com/arctic/exploration.shtml|title=ARCTIC EXPLORATION - CHRONOLOGY|accessdate=2006-10-19|publisher=Quark Expeditions|year=2004 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060911074922/http://www.quarkexpeditions.com/arctic/exploration.shtml |archivedate = 2006-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; accompanied by his employee [[Matthew Henson]] and four Inuit men Ootah, [[Seegloo]], Egingway, and Ooqueah (although whether he actually reached the Pole is doubted by some).&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/encyclopedia/arctic_the.jsp|title=ARCTIC, THE|accessdate=2006-10-19|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2004|work=Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="caencyclo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=J1ARTJ0005796|title=North Pole|accessdate=2006-10-20|publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norwegian explorer [[Roald Amundsen]] had planned to reach the [[North Pole]] by means of an extended drift in an icebound ship. He obtained the use of [[Fridtjof Nansen]]'s polar exploration ship ''[[Fram]]'', and undertook extensive fundraising. Preparations for this expedition were disrupted when Cook and Peary each claimed to have reached the North Pole. Amundsen then changed his plan and began to prepare for a conquest of the [[geographic South Pole]]; uncertain of the extent to which the public and his backers would support him, he kept this revised objective secret. When he set out in June&amp;nbsp;1910, he led even his crew to believe they were embarking on an Arctic drift, and revealed their true Antarctic destination only when ''Fram'' was leaving their last port of call, Madeira.

[[Amundsen's South Pole expedition]], with Amundsen and four others, arrived at the pole on 14&amp;nbsp;December 1911,&lt;ref&gt;Some sources give the date as 15&amp;nbsp;December. Since the western and eastern hemispheres are conjoined at the South Pole, both dates can be considered as correct, though Amundsen gives 14&amp;nbsp;December, both in his first telegraphed report on arrival in Hobart, and in his fuller account, ''The South Pole''. Huntford, ''The Last Place on Earth'' (1985), p. 511.&lt;/ref&gt; five weeks ahead of a British party led by [[Robert Falcon Scott]] as part of the [[Terra Nova Expedition]]. Amundsen and his team returned safely to their base, and later learned that Scott and his four companions had died on their return journey.

Traditional '''Polynesian navigation''' was used for thousands of years to make long voyages across thousands of miles of the [[Pelagic zone|open]] [[Pacific Ocean]]. [[Navigator]]s travelled to small inhabited islands using [[wayfinding]] techniques and knowledge passed by [[oral tradition]] from master to apprentice, often in the form of song. Generally each island maintained a [[guild]] of navigators who had very high status; in times of famine or difficulty they could trade for aid or evacuate people to neighboring islands. As of 2014, these traditional [[navigation]] methods are still taught in the [[Polynesian outlier]] of [[Duff Islands|Taumako Island]] in the [[Islands of the Solomon Islands|Solomons]].

Polynesian navigation used some navigational instruments, which predate and are distinct from the machined metal tools used by European navigators (such as the [[sextant]], first produced in 1730; the [[sea astrolabe]], from around late 15th century; and the [[marine chronometer]], invented in 1761). However, they also relied heavily on close observation of sea sign and a large body of knowledge from oral tradition.&lt;ref name="Leisl Clark"&gt;{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Liesl |title=Polynesia's Genius Navigators |date=15 February 2000 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/polynesia-genius-navigators.html |accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[wayfinding]] techniques and [[outrigger canoe]] construction methods have been kept as [[Trade secret|guild secrets]], but in the modern revival of these skills, they are being recorded and published.

==History==
{{See also|Ancient Hawaii|Discovery and settlement of Hawaii}}
[[File:Polynesia.png|thumb|A projection of the [[Polynesian triangle]] on the globe.]]
Between about 3000 and 1000 BC speakers of Austronesian languages spread through the islands of [[Southeast Asia]] – almost certainly starting out from [[Taiwan]],&lt;ref name="howe20069298"&gt;{{Citation |title=Vaka Moana: Voyages of the Ancestors – the discovery and settlement of the Pacific |last=Howe |first=K. R |year=2006 |publisher=David Bateman |location=Albany, Auckland |pages=92–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; as tribes whose [[Taiwanese aborigines|natives]] were thought to have previously arrived from mainland South China about 8000 years ago – into the edges of western [[Micronesia]] and on into [[Melanesia]]. In the archaeological record there are well-defined traces of this expansion which allow the path it took to be followed and dated with a degree of certainty. In the mid-2nd millennium BC a distinctive culture appeared suddenly in north-west Melanesia, in the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], the chain of islands forming a great arch from [[New Britain]] to the [[Admiralty Islands]]. This culture, known as [[Lapita]], stands out in the Melanesian archeological record, with its large permanent villages on beach terraces along the coasts. Particularly characteristic of the Lapita culture is the making of pottery, including a great many vessels of varied shapes, some distinguished by fine patterns and motifs pressed into the clay. Within a mere three or four centuries between about 1300 and 900 BC, the Lapita culture spread 6000&amp;nbsp;km further to the east from the Bismarck Archipelago, until it reached as far as [[Tonga]] and [[Samoa]].{{sfn|Bellwood|1987|pp=45–65}} Lapita pottery persisted in places such as [[Samoa]], [[Tonga]], and [[Fiji]] for many years after its upbringing to Western and Central Polynesia. However, pottery-making died out in most of Polynesia due to the scarcity of clay on the islands.&lt;ref name="Originalpeople.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lapita culture: ancestors of Polynesians, Micronesians, and some coastal areas of Melanesia|url=http://originalpeople.org/lapita-culture/|website=Originalpeople.org|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this region, the distinctive Polynesian culture developed. The Polynesians are then believed to have spread eastward from the Samoan Islands into the Marquesas, the Society Islands, the Hawaiian Islands and Easter Island; and south to New Zealand. The pattern of settlement also extended to the north of Samoa to the Tuvaluan atolls, with [[Tuvalu]] providing a stepping stone to migration into the [[Polynesian outliers|Polynesian Outlier communities]] in [[Melanesia]] and [[Micronesia]].{{sfn|Bellwood|1987|pp=29, 54}}&lt;ref name="Bayard"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bayard|first1=D.

==Canoes and navigation==
The Polynesians encountered nearly every island within the vast [[Polynesian Triangle]] using outrigger canoes or double-hulled canoes. The double-hulled canoes were two large hulls, equal in length, and lashed side by side. The space between the paralleled canoes allowed for storage of food, hunting materials, and nets when embarking on long voyages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellwood|first1=Peter|title=The Polynesians Prehistory of an Island People|date=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=NY|isbn=9780500020937|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polynesians used strategic and natural navigation aides such as the stars, ocean currents, and wind patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellwood|first1=Peter|title=The Polynesians Prehistory of an Island People|date=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=NY|isbn=9780500020937|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Navigational devices==
[[File:Polynesian navigation device showing directions of winds, waves and islands.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Polynesian navigation device showing directions of winds, waves and islands, c. 1904]]
There are numerous traditional Polynesian devices used for navigating and/or teaching navigation. These include charts, spatial representations of islands and the conditions around them, and navigational instruments, such as those for measuring the elevation of celestial objects. They also include non-physical devices such as songs and stories for memorizing the properties of stars, islands, and navigational routes.

==Navigational techniques==
Navigation relies heavily on constant observation and memorization; you must constantly be aware of your surroundings. You cannot simply look up at the stars and know where you are. You are only able to know where you are if you are able to memorize where you have sailed from. The sun was the main guide for voyagers because they could follow its exact points as it rose and set; then, at night time they'd switch to using the stars rising and setting points. With constant observation, comes the knowledge of knowing and remembering the speed of your canoe (when it speeds up and slows down), what direction you are facing, and what time of the day or night it is. In the ancient days, they did not have watches, compasses or speedometers but they had their minds and the ability to memorize their surroundings. When there are no stars because of a cloudy night or during midday, the navigator would use the winds and swells to guide them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Nainoa|title=On Wayfinding|url=http://archive.hokulea.com/ike/hookele/on_wayfinding.html|website=Polynesian Voyaging Society|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Polynesian navigators employed a whole range of techniques including use of the stars, the movement of ocean currents and wave patterns, the air and sea interference patterns caused by islands and [[atoll]]s, the flight of birds, the winds and the weather.&lt;ref name="Gatty_1958"&gt;{{harvnb|Gatty|1958}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bird observation===
Certain seabirds such as the [[White tern]] and Noddy tern feed on fish in the morning and return to rest on land at night time. Navigators use these birds to guide them to land by following where the birds are flying from in the morning and flying toward at night. Birds habits change during nesting season which is another thing navigators must be mindful of when voyaging. Generally speaking, if a navigator can see a large group of birds, that is a much more reliable sign for land than following one, two or a small group of birds.&lt;ref name="Lewis 1972"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=David|title=We, the Navigators|date=1972|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=HI|isbn=9780824802295}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Harold Gatty]] suggested that long-distance Polynesian voyaging followed the seasonal paths of [[bird migration]]s. In "The Raft Book",&lt;ref&gt;"[http://blog.library.si.edu/tag/harold-gatty/ Be Your Own Navigator]," ''Smithsonian Libraries Unbound'', 11 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; a survival guide he wrote for the U.S. military during World War II, Gatty outlined various Polynesian navigation techniques Allied sailors or aviators wrecked at sea could use to find their way to land. There are some references in their oral traditions to the flight of birds and some say that there were range marks onshore pointing to distant islands in line with the [[West Pacific Flyway]]. A voyage from Tahiti, the Tuamotus or the Cook Islands to New Zealand might have followed the migration of the [[long-tailed cuckoo]] (''Eudynamys taitensis'') just as the voyage from Tahiti to Hawai{{okina}}i would coincide with the track of the [[Pacific golden plover]] (''Pluvialis fulva'') and the [[bristle-thighed curlew]] (''Numenius tahitiensis''). It is also believed that Polynesians employed shore-sighting birds as did many seafaring peoples. One theory is that they would have taken a [[frigatebird]] (''Fregata'') with them. These birds refuse to land on the water as their feathers will become waterlogged making it impossible to fly. When the voyagers thought they were close to land they may have released the bird, which would either fly towards land or else return to the canoe.&lt;ref name="Gatty_1958" /&gt;

===Navigation by the stars===
[[File:Mau-star-compass.png|thumb|A photograph of a recreation of the star compass of [[Mau Piailug]] depicted with shells on sand, with [[Satawalese]] (See [[Trukic languages]]) text labels, as described and translated by the [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pvs.kcc.hawaii.edu/ike/hookele/star_compasses.html |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5rkR1hSvX?url=http://pvs.kcc.hawaii.edu/ike/hookele/star_compasses.html |archive-date=5 August 2010 |title=Star Compasses |publisher=Polynesian Voyaging Society |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shown here north-up. See annotations on Commons.]]
The positions of the stars helped guide Polynesians through their voyaging routes. Stars- as opposed to planets are able to hold a steady position year-round. The only thing that changes is the time the star rises which changes seasonally. Polynesian voyagers would follow stars near the horizon whether they were just rising or about to set and they used these specific stars for guidance. These stars were used to set the direction for their canoe up until the point when those stars rise too high and are no longer easy to follow. Once the star they've used to guide them rises too high, they use the next star that rises from the previous stars exact rising point to guide them next. The canoes latitude and the course being followed determines how many stars the navigator will need to get him to his destination.&lt;ref name="Lewis 1972"/&gt;
For navigators near the equator [[celestial navigation]] is simplified since the whole [[celestial sphere]] is exposed. Any star that passes the [[zenith]] (overhead) is on the [[celestial equator]], the basis of the [[equatorial coordinate system]]. Each star has a specific [[declination]], and when they rise or set, they give a [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] for navigation. Stars are learned by compass point, making a star compass (star compasses list ~150 stars, in some systems&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Gatty]] (1958). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=r7XDAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Nature Is Your Guide]'', p.&amp;nbsp;45&lt;/ref&gt;). A simplified compass might list only a couple of dozen stars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.hokulea.com/ike/hookele/star_compasses.html Star Compass diagrams with translations]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the [[Caroline Islands]] [[Mau Piailug]] taught natural navigation using a [[List of selected stars for navigation|star compass]] diagrammed here. The development of "[[Compass rose#Sidereal compass rose|sidereal compasses]]" has been studied&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, M. D. (1985) ''[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/pdf-files/Halpern-MA1985.pdf The Origins of the Carolinian Sidereal Compass]'', Master's thesis, [[Texas A &amp; M University]]&lt;/ref&gt; and theorized to have developed from an [[pelorus (instrument)#Ancient instrument|ancient pelorus]].&lt;ref name="Gatty_1958" /&gt;

The Polynesians also took measurements of stellar elevation to determine their latitude. The latitudes of specific islands were also known, and the technique of "sailing down the latitude" was used.

===Swell===
The Polynesians also use wave and swell formations to navigate. Many of the habitable areas of the Pacific Ocean are groups of islands (or atolls) in chains hundreds of kilometers long. Island chains have predictable effects on waves and on currents. Navigators who lived within a group of islands would learn the effect various islands had on their shape, direction, and motion and would have been able to correct their path in accordance with the changes they perceived.  When they arrived in the vicinity of a chain of islands they were unfamiliar with, they may have been able to transfer their experience and deduce that they were nearing a group of islands. Once they had arrived fairly close to a destination island, they would have been able to pinpoint its location by sightings of land-based birds, certain cloud formations, as well as the reflections shallow water made on the undersides of clouds. It is thought that the Polynesian navigators may have measured the time it took to sail between islands in "canoe-days" or a similar type of expression.&lt;ref name="Gatty_1958" /&gt;
The energy that is transferred from the wind to the sea are wind waves. The waves that are created when the energy travels down away from the source area (like ripples) are known as swell. When the winds are strong at the source area, the swell is larger. The longer the wind blows, the longer the swell lasts. Because the swells of the ocean can remain consistent for days, navigators relied on them to carry their canoe in a straight line from one house on the star compass to a house of the same name on the opposite side of the horizon. Navigators were not always able to see stars; because of this, they relied on the swells of the ocean. Swell patterns are a much more reliable method of navigation than the actual waves which are determined by the local winds. Swells move in a straight direction which makes it easier for the navigator to determine whether the canoe is heading in the correct direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gooley|first1=Tristan|title=How to Read Water: Clues, Signs &amp; Patterns from Puddles to the Sea|year=2016|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|location=NY|isbn=9781473615205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Routes==

On [[First voyage of James Cook|his first voyage of Pacific exploration]], Captain James Cook had the services of a Polynesian navigator, [[Tupaia (navigator)|Tupaia]], who drew a chart of the islands within a {{convert|2000|mi|km}} radius (to the north and west) of his home island of [[Ra'iatea]]. Tupaia had knowledge of 130 islands and named 74 on his chart.&lt;ref name="Druett2"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Druett |first1= Joan |title=Tupaia – The Remarkable Story of Captain Cook's Polynesian Navigator |year= 1987 |publisher=Random House |location=New Zealand||pages=226–227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tupaia had navigated from Ra'iatea in short voyages to 13 islands. He had not visited western Polynesia, as since his grandfather's time the extent of voyaging by Raiateans had diminished to the islands of eastern Polynesia.  His grandfather and father had passed to Tupaia the knowledge as to the location of the major islands of western Polynesia and the navigation information necessary to voyage to [[Fiji]], [[Samoa]] and [[Tonga]].&lt;ref name="Druett1"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Druett |first1= Joan |title=Tupaia – The Remarkable Story of Captain Cook's Polynesian Navigator |year= 1987 |publisher=Random House |location=New Zealand |pages=218–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tupaia was hired by Joseph Banks, the ship's naturalist, who wrote that Cook ignored Tupaia's chart and his skills as a navigator.&lt;ref name="O'Sullivan"&gt;{{cite book |title =In search of Captain Cook | first =Dan | last =O'Sullivan | year =2008 | publisher =I.B.

===Subantarctic and Antarctica===
[[Image:Antarctica Map.png|350px|thumb|right|Antarctica and surrounding islands, showing the [[Auckland Islands]] just above (south of) New Zealand, at the center bottom of the image]]

There is academic debate on the furthest southern extent of Polynesian expansion.

There is material evidence of Polynesian visits to some of the [[New Zealand Subantarctic Islands|subantarctic islands to the south of New Zealand]], which are outside Polynesia proper. Remains of a Polynesian settlement dating back to the 13th century were found on [[Enderby Island]] in the [[Auckland Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Tom ''Polynesians in the Southern Ocean: Occupation of the Auckland Islands in Prehistory'' in New Zealand Geographic 69 (September–October 2004): 6–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Atholl J., &amp; Gerard R.

=== Pre-Columbian contact with the Americas ===
{{Main|Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact}}
In the mid-20th century, [[Thor Heyerdahl]] proposed a new theory of Polynesian origins (one which did not win general acceptance), arguing that the Polynesians had migrated from South America on [[balsa]]-log boats.&lt;ref name="Sharp_1963_122128"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharp|1963|pp=122–128}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Finney_1963_5" /&gt;

The presence in the [[Cook Islands]] of [[Ipomoea batatas|sweet potato]] that is a plant native to the Americas (called ''kūmara'' in [[Māori language|Māori]]), which have been radiocarbon-dated to 1000 CE, has been cited as evidence that Americans could have traveled to Oceania. The current thinking is that sweet potato was brought to central Polynesia circa 700 CE and spread across Polynesia from there, possibly by Polynesians who had traveled to South America and back.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Van Tilburg |first=Jo Anne |year=1994 |title=Easter Island: Archaeology, Ecology and Culture |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative explanation posits [[biological dispersal]]; plants and/or seeds could float across the Pacific without any human contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climate.uvic.ca/people/alvaro/SPotato.pdf |title=Modeling the prehistoric arrival of the sweet potato in Polynesia |last=Montenegro |first=A. |display-authors=etal |work=Journal of Archaeological Science |publisher=University of Victoria |accessdate=6 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628030307/http://climate.uvic.ca/people/alvaro/SPotato.pdf |archivedate=28 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study published in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' examined [[chicken]] bones at [[El Arenal, Chile|El Arenal]] near the [[Arauco Peninsula]], [[Arauco Province]], [[Chile]]. The results suggested Oceania-to-America contact. Chickens originated in southern Asia and the ''Araucana'' breed of Chile was thought to have been brought by Spaniards around 1500. However, the bones found in Chile were radiocarbon-dated to between 1304 and 1424, well before the documented arrival of the Spanish. DNA sequences taken were exact matches to those of chickens from the same period in [[American Samoa]] and [[Tonga]], both over 5000 miles (8000 kilometers) away from Chile.  The genetic sequences were also similar to those found in [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] and [[Easter Island]], the closest island at only 2500 miles (4000 kilometers), and unlike any breed of European chicken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.livescience.com/history/070604_polynesian_chicken.html | title =  Chicken Bones Suggest Polynesians Found Americas Before Columbus | journal = Live Science | date = 4 June 2007 | accessdate = 5 June 2007 | last = Whipps | first = Heather | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-sci-chickens5jun05,1,4338408.story?coll=la-headlines-nation |title=Polynesians beat Spaniards to South America, study shows |first=Thomas H., II |last=Maugh |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=5 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Storey |first=A.

Although this initial report suggested a Polynesian pre-Columbian origin a later report looking at the same specimens concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

A published, apparently pre-Columbian, Chilean specimen and six pre-European Polynesian specimens also cluster with the same European/Indian subcontinental/Southeast Asian sequences, providing no support for a Polynesian introduction of chickens to South America. In contrast, sequences from two archaeological sites on Easter Island group with an uncommon haplogroup from Indonesia, Japan, and China and may represent a genetic signature of an early Polynesian dispersal. Modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the Chilean archaeological specimen casts further doubt on claims for pre-Columbian chickens, and definitive proof will require further analyses of ancient DNA sequences and radiocarbon and stable isotope data from archaeological excavations within both Chile and Polynesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Indo-European and Asian origins for Chilean and Pacific chickens revealed by mtDNA| first1=J. |last1=Gongora |display-authors=etal |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |year=2008 |volume=105 |issue=30 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/30/10308 |pages=10308–10313 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0801991105|pmc=2492461 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in a later study, the original authors extended and elaborated their findings, concluding:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

This comprehensive approach demonstrates that the examination of modern chicken DNA sequences does not contribute to our understanding of the origins of Chile’s earliest chickens. Interpretations based on poorly sourced and documented modern chicken populations, divorced from the archaeological and historical evidence, do not withstand scrutiny. Instead, this expanded account will confirm the pre-Columbian age of the El Arenal remains and lend support to our original hypothesis that their appearance in South America is most likely due to Polynesian contact with the Americas in prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Polynesian Chickens in the New World: a detailed application of a commensal approach

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the last 20 years, the dates and anatomical features of human remains found in [[Mexico]] and South America have led some archaeologists{{who|date=February 2014}} to propose that those regions were first populated by people who crossed the Pacific several millennia before the [[Ice Age]] migrations; according to this theory, these would have been either eliminated or absorbed by the Siberian immigrants. However, current archaeological evidence for human migration to and settlement of remote Oceania (i.e., the [[Pacific Ocean]] eastwards of the [[Solomon Islands]]) is dated to no earlier than approximately 3,500 [[Before Present|BP]];&lt;ref&gt;Kirch, Patrick V. [http://sscl.berkeley.edu/~oal/background/background.htm ''Background to Pacific Archaeology and Prehistory''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609112244/http://sscl.berkeley.edu/~oal/background/background.htm |date=9 June 2007 }}, Oceanic Archaeology Laboratory, Univ. California, Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt; trans-Pacific contact with the Americas coinciding with or pre-dating the Beringia migrations of at least 11,500 BP is highly problematic, except for movement along intercoastal routes.

Recently, linguist [[Kathryn A. Klar]] of [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[archaeologist]] [[Terry L. Jones]] of [[California Polytechnic State University]] have proposed contacts between Polynesians and the [[Chumash (tribe)|Chumash]] and [[Gabrielino]] of [[Southern California]], between 500 and 700.  Their primary evidence consists of the advanced sewn-plank canoe design, which is used throughout the Polynesian Islands, but is unknown in North America – except for those two tribes. Moreover, the Chumash word for "sewn-plank canoe", ''[[tomolo'o]]'', may have been derived from ''kumulaa'au'', a Hawaiian word meaning "useful tree".

In 2008, an expedition starting on the Philippines sailed two modern [[James Wharram|Wharram]]-designed catamarans loosely based on a Polynesian catamaran found in Auckland Museum New Zealand. The boats were built in the Philippines by an experienced boat builder to Wharram designs using modern strip plank with epoxy resin glue built over plywood frames. The catamarans had modern Dacron sails, Terylene stays and sheets with modern roller blocks. Wharram says he used Polynesian navigation to sail along the coast of Northern New Guinea and then sailed 150 miles to an island for which he had modern charts, proving that it is possible to sail a modern catamaran along the path of the Lapita Pacific migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lapita-voyage.org/en/lapita_voyage.html |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204449/http://www.lapita-voyage.org/en/lapita_voyage.html |archive-date=3 March 2016 |title=Lapita Voyage – The first expedition following the migration route of the ancient Polynesians|first=Klaus |last=Hympendahl|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many other modern Polynesian "replica" voyages the Wharram catamarans were not towed or escorted by a modern vessel with modern GPS navigation system, nor were they fitted with a motor.

Polynesian contact with the prehispanic [[Mapuche]] culture in central-south Chile has been suggested because of apparently similar cultural traits, including words like ''toki'' (stone axes and adzes), hand clubs similar to the [[Māori language|Māori]] ''wahaika'', the sewn-plank canoe as used on Chiloe island, the ''curanto'' earth oven (Polynesian ''umu'') common in southern Chile, fishing techniques such as stone wall enclosures, a hockey-like game, and other potential parallels. Some strong westerlies and [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño]] wind blow directly from central-east Polynesia to the Mapuche region, between Concepcion and Chiloe. A direct connection from New Zealand is possible, sailing with the [[Roaring Forties]]. In 1834, some escapees from [[Tasmania]] arrived at Chiloe Island after sailing for 43 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Rapa Nui | language = Spanish |url = http://www.rapanuivalparaiso.cl/arque_olog.htm#ar5 | accessdate = 5 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=David|title=We, the Navigators: The Ancient Art of Landfinding in the Pacific|date=1972|publisher=Australian National University Press|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival==
The first settlers who sailed to the [[Hawaiian Islands]] are said to have arrived as early as 400 C.E by Polynesians from the [[Marquesas Islands]]. Captain [[James Cook]] was the first European to arrive to the island of [[Kaua’i]] in 1778. He returned a year later and was killed in an altercation with natives at [[Kealakekua Bay]]. In 1973, [[Ben Finney]] established the [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]] to test the contentious question of how Polynesians found their islands. The team claimed to be able to replicate ancient Hawaiian double-hulled canoes capable of sailing across the ocean using strictly traditional voyaging techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Finney|first1=Ben|title=Voyaging into Polynesia's Past The Founding of the Polynesian Voyaging Society|url=http://archive.hokulea.com/finneyfounding.html|website=Hokule'a|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, a Hawaiian named [[Nainoa Thompson]] invented a new method of [[wayfinding|non-instrument navigation]] (called the "modern Hawaiian wayfinding system"), enabling him to complete the voyage from Hawai{{okina}}i to [[Tahiti]] and back. In 1987, a [[Māori people|Māori]] named Matahi Whakataka (Greg Brightwell) and his mentor Francis Cowan sailed from Tahiti to [[Aotearoa]] without instruments.

In New Zealand, a leading Māori navigator and ship builder is [[Hector Busby]] who was also inspired and influenced by Nainoa Thompson and Hokulea's voyage there in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maoriart.org.nz/hekenukumai-hector-busby-p-149.html |title=Profile: Hekenukumai (Hector) Busby |work=[[Toi Māori Aotearoa]] |accessdate=12 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141011205028/http://www.maoriart.org.nz/hekenukumai-hector-busby-p-149.html |archivedate=11 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wakatapu.com/ | title=Waka Tapu Canoes | publisher=[[NZMACI]] &amp; Taitokerau Tarai Waka | accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mau Piailug.gif|thumb|right|150px|Navigator [[Mau Piailug]] (1932–2010) of [[Satawal]] island, Micronesia]]
Knowledge of the traditional Polynesian methods of navigation was widely lost after contact with and colonization by Europeans. This caused debates over the reasons for the presence of the Polynesians in such isolated and scattered parts of the Pacific. According to [[Andrew Sharp (historian)|Andrew Sharp]], the explorer Captain [[James Cook]], already familiar with [[Charles de Brosses]]'s accounts of large groups of Pacific islanders who were driven off course in storms and ended up hundreds of miles away with no idea where they were, encountered in the course of one of his own voyages a castaway group of Tahitians who had become lost at sea in a gale and blown 1000 miles away to the island of [[Atiu]]. Cook wrote that this incident "will serve to explain, better than the thousand conjectures of speculative reasoners, how the detached parts of the earth, and, in particular, how the South Seas, may have been peopled".&lt;ref name="Sharp_1963_16"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharp|1963|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 19th century to the early 20th century, a more generous view of Polynesian navigation had come into favor, creating a much romanticized view of their seamanship, canoes, and navigational expertise. Late 19th and early 20th centuries writers such as [[Abraham Fornander]] and [[Percy Smith (ethnologist)|Percy Smith]] told of heroic Polynesians migrating in great coordinated fleets from Asia far and wide into present-day Polynesia.&lt;ref name="Finney_1963_5"&gt;{{harvnb|Finney|1963|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view was presented by Andrew Sharp who challenged the "heroic vision" hypothesis, asserting instead that Polynesian maritime expertise was severely limited in the field of exploration and that as a result the settlement of Polynesia had been the result of luck, random island sightings, and drifting, rather than as organized voyages of colonization. Thereafter the oral knowledge passed down for generations allowed for eventual mastery of traveling between known locations.&lt;ref name="Sharp_1963"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharp|1963}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sharp's reassessment caused a huge amount of controversy and led to a stalemate between the romantic and the skeptical views.&lt;ref name="Finney_1963_5" /&gt;

[[File:Double hulled vaka, Rarotonga 2010.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Doubled hulled ''vaka'' in [[Rarotonga]], 2010.]]

By the mid-to-late 1960s it was time for a new hands-on approach. Anthropologist [[David Henry Lewis|David Lewis]] sailed his catamaran from Tahiti to New Zealand using [[stellar navigation]] without instruments.&lt;ref name="Lewis_1976"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist and historian [[Ben Finney]] built ''Nalehia'', a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} replica of a Hawaiian [[Outrigger canoe|double canoe]].  Finney tested the canoe in a series of sailing and paddling experiments in Hawaiian waters. At the same time, ethnographic research in the Caroline Islands in [[Micronesia]] brought to light the fact that traditional stellar navigational methods were still very much in everyday use there. The building and testing of proa canoes (''[[Wa (watercraft)|wa]]'') inspired by traditional designs, the harnessing of knowledge from skilled Micronesians, as well as voyages using stellar navigation, allowed practical conclusions about the seaworthiness and handling capabilities of traditional Polynesian canoes and allowed a better understanding of the navigational methods that were likely to have been used by the Polynesians and of how they, as people, were adapted to seafaring.&lt;ref name="Finney_1963_69"&gt;{{harvnb|Finney|1963|pp=6–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent re-creations of Polynesian voyaging have used methods based largely on Micronesian methods and the teachings of a Micronesian navigator, [[Mau Piailug]].&lt;ref&gt;See also: [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]], [[Hokulea]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with Polynesian oral tradition, the geography of Polynesian navigation pathways are said to resemble the geometric qualities of an octopus with head centred on [[Ra'iātea]] (French Polynesia) and tentacles spread out across the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;E. Tetahiotupa, ''Au gré des vents et des courants'' ([[Éditions des Mers Australes]]) 2009, https://www.tahiti-infos.com/Pourquoi-le-Triangle-polynesien-est-une-pieuvre_a135121.html&lt;/ref&gt; In oral tradition the octopus is known by various names such as [[Taumata-Fe'e-Fa'atupu-Hau]] (Grand Octopus of Prosperity), [[Tumu-Ra'i-Fenua]] (Beginning-of-Heaven-and-Earth) and [[Te Wheke-a-Muturangi]] (The Octopus of [[Muturangi]]).

Q-guidance is used for missiles whose trajectory consists of a relatively short [[boost phase]] (or powered phase) during which the missile's propulsion system operates, followed by a [[coast phase|ballistic phase]] during which the missile coasts to its target under the influence of gravity. ([[Cruise missile]]s use different guidance methods).  The objective of Q-guidance is to hit a specified target at a specified time (if there is some flexibility as to the time the target should be hit then other types of guidance can be used).

==Early Implementations==

At the time Q-guidance was developed the main competitive method was called Delta-guidance. According to Mackenzie,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Mackenzie: Inventing Accuracy&lt;/ref&gt; [[Titan missile|Titan]], some versions of [[Atlas missile|Atlas]], [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman]] I and II used Delta-guidance, while Q-guidance was used for [[Thor missile|Thor IRBM]] and [[Polaris missile|Polaris]], and presumably [[Poseidon missile|Poseidon]]. It appears, from monitoring of test launches, that early Soviet ICBMs used a variant of Delta-guidance.

==Delta-guidance overview==

Delta-guidance is based on adherence to a planned reference trajectory, which is developed before the flight using ground-based computers and stored in the missile's guidance system. In flight, the actual trajectory is modeled mathematically as a [[Taylor series]] expansion around the reference trajectory. The guidance system attempts to zero the linear terms of this expression, i.e. to bring the missile back to the planned trajectory.  For this reason, Delta-guidance is sometimes referred to as "fly [along] the wire", where the (imaginary) wire refers to the reference trajectory.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In contrast, Q-guidance is a dynamic method, reminiscent of the theories [[dynamic programming]] or [[State space (controls)|state based feedback]].  In essence, it says "never mind where we were supposed to be, given where we are what should we do to make progress towards the goal of reaching the required target at the required time".  To do this it relies on the concept of "velocity to be gained".

==Velocity To Be Gained==
At a given time ''t'' and for a given vehicle position ''r'', the correlated velocity vector ''V''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as follows: if the vehicle had the velocity ''V''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and the propulsion system was turned off, then the missile would reach the desired target at the desired time under the influence of gravity.  In some sense, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the desired velocity.

The actual velocity of the missile is denoted by ''V''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and the missile is subject to both the acceleration due to gravity ''g'' and that due to the engines ''a''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;.  The velocity to be gained is defined as the difference between ''V''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;V_{TBG} = V_c - V_m&lt;/math&gt;

A simple guidance strategy is to apply acceleration (i.e. engine thrust) in the direction of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;TBG&lt;/sub&gt;.  This will have the effect of making the actual velocity come closer to ''V''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.  When they become equal (i.e. when ''V''&lt;sub&gt;TBG&lt;/sub&gt; becomes identically zero) it is time to shut off the engines, since the missile is by definition able to reach the desired target at the desired time on its own.

The only remaining issue is how to compute ''V''&lt;sub&gt;TBG&lt;/sub&gt; easily from information available on board the vehicle.

==The Q Matrix==

A remarkably simple differential equation can be used to compute the velocity to be gained:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dV_{TBG}}{dt} = -a_T - Q V_{TBG}&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''Q'' matrix is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;Q = \left. \frac{\partial V_c}{\partial r}\right|_{r_T,t_f}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Q'' is a symmetric 3 by 3 time-varying matrix.  (The vertical bar refers to the fact that the derivative must be evaluated for a given target position ''r''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; and time of free flight ''t''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;.)&lt;ref&gt;Battin: Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; The calculation of this matrix is non-trivial, but can be performed offline before the flight; experience shows that the matrix is only slowly time varying, so only a few values of Q corresponding to different times during the flight need to be stored on board the vehicle.

In early applications the integration of the differential equation was performed using analog hardware, rather than a digital computer. Information about vehicle acceleration, velocity and position is supplied by the onboard [[Inertial measurement unit]].

'''Derivation of the equation'''

Notation:

''t'' the current time

''r'' the current vehicle position vector

''V''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; the current vehicle velocity vector

''T'' the time the vehicle will reach the target

''t''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; the time of free flight for the correlated vehicle, i.e. t-T

[...]

==Cross Product Steering==

A reasonable strategy to gradually align the thrust vector to the ''V''&lt;sub&gt;TBG&lt;/sub&gt; vector is to steer at a rate proportional to the cross product between them.  A simple control strategy that does this is to steer at the rate

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \kappa (a_T \times V_{TBG})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is a constant. This implicitly assumes that ''V''&lt;sub&gt;TBG&lt;/sub&gt; remains roughly constant during the maneuver.  A somewhat more clever strategy can be designed that takes into account the rate of time change of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;TBG&lt;/sub&gt; as well, since this is available from the differential equation above.

This second control strategy is based on Battin's insight&lt;ref&gt;Battin: An Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; that "If you want to drive a vector to zero, it is [expedient] to align the time rate of change of the vector with the vector itself". This suggests setting the auto-pilot steering rate to

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \kappa (V_{TBG} \times \frac{d V_{TBG}}{dt})&lt;/math&gt;

Either of these methods are referred to as '''cross-product steering''', and they are easy to implement in analog hardware.

Finally, when all components of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;TBG&lt;/sub&gt; are small, the order to cut-off engine power can be given.

'''Road curves''' are regular bends in [[roads]] to bring a gradual change of direction. Similar curves are on [[railways]] and [[canals]].

Curves provided in the horizontal plane are known as horizontal curves and are generally circular or parabolic.

Four types of circular curves are on roads:
* Simple curve
* Compound curve
* Reverse or serpentine curve
* Deviation curve

==Simple curve==
[[File:Curve 2014-08-18 12-57.jpg|thumb|Diagram of simple curve]]
A simple curve has the same [[radius]] throughout and is a single [[arc (geometry)|arc]] of a [[circle]], with two [[tangent]]s meeting at the intersection (B in this diagram).

==Compound curve==
[[File:Road curve 2014-08-18 12-16.jpg|thumb|Diagram of compound curve]]
A compound curve has two or more simple curves with different radii that bend the same way and are on the same side of a common tangent. In this diagram, MN is the common tangent.

==Reverse curve==
{{main article|Reverse curve}}
[[File:Curve 2014-08-18 12-52.jpg|thumb|Diagram of reverse curve]]
Also called a serpentine curve, it is the reverse of a compound curve, and two simple curves bent in opposite directions are on opposite sides of the common tangent.

==Deviation curve==
[[File:Curve 2014-08-18 12-19.jpg|thumb|Diagram of deviation curve]]
A deviation curve is simply a combination of two reverse curves. It is used when it is necessary to deviate from a given straight path to avoid intervening obstructions such as a building, a body of water, or other significant site.

The '''Rosgen [[Stream]] Classification''' is a system for natural [[river]]s in which morphological arrangements of stream characteristics are organized into relatively homogeneous stream types.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Rosgen, David L. 1994. “A Classification of Natural Rivers.” ''CATENA'' 22 (3): 169–99. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/0341-8162(94)90001-9&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a widely-used method for classifying streams and rivers based on common patterns of channel morphology.&lt;ref&gt;EPA, 2018. “Fundamentals of Rosgen Stream Classification System | Watershed Academy Web | US EPA.” n.d. Accessed May 6, 2018. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://cfpub.epa.gov/watertrain/moduleFrame.cfm?parent_object_id=1189&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The specific objectives of this stream classification system are as follows: 1) predict a rivers behavior from its appearance; 2) develop specific [[hydrologic]] and sediment relationships for a given stream type and its state; 3) provide mechanisms to extrapolate site-specific data to stream reaches having similar characteristics; and 4) provide a consistent frame of reference for communicating stream [[River morphology|morphology]] and condition among a variety of disciplines and interested parties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These objectives are met through Rosgen's four hierarchical levels (I-IV) of river morphology.

== Hierarchy of the Rosgen Stream Classification ==

=== Level I: Geomorphic Characterization ===
Level I categorize stream types into letters A - G based on their [[geomorphic]] characteristics that result from the integration of basin relief, land form, and valley morphology.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Rosgen, David L. and H.L. Silvey 1996. “Applied River Morphology” Second Edition. ''Wildland Hydrology''. Pagosa Springs, CO.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a general way in which the morphology of a stream can be described. Many of the Level I criteria can be determined through [[topographic]] and landform maps, aerial imagery, and geospatial data.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Level II: Morphological Description ====
Level II characterizes stream type by using numbers 1 - 6, in addition to letters A - G, to include the assessments of the channel cross-section, longitudinal profile, and plan-form pattern.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cross-section measurements include a streams entrenchment ratio, width/depth ratio, and dominant substrate. The longitudinal and plan-form measurements consist of [[slope]], stream bed features, [[sinuosity]], and [[meander]] width ratio. Level II is a quantitative morphological assessment of the stream reach which provides greater detail from data collected in the field for the implementation into land management decisions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Level III: Assessment of Stream Condition and Departure from its Potential ====
Level III describes the existing condition of a stream as it relates to its stability, response potential, and function.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This level includes additional measurements such as, sediment supply, channel stability, and flow regime which further describe the condition or “state” of the stream.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Level IV: Field Data Verification ====
Level IV verifies the process relationships inferred from the previous three levels of classification.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The objective of this level is to determine empirical relationships for use in prediction (e.g. to develop [[Manning's n|Manning’s n]] values from measured [[velocity]])&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Applications ===
The Rosgen Stream Classification is probably best applied as a communication tool to describe channel form.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Simon A., Doyle M., Kondolf M., Shields F.D., Rhoads B., and McPhillips M. 2007. “Critical Evaluation of How the Rosgen Classification and Associated ‘Natural Channel Design’ Methods Fail to Integrate and Quantify Fluvial Processes and Channel Response1.” ''JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association'' 43 (5): 1117–31. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2007.00091.x&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses for the Rosgen Stream Classification include fish habitat indices, surveys of [[Riparian zone|riparian]] communities, [[stream restoration]] and mitigation, engineering, evaluating livestock grazing related to stream type, and the utilization of sediment and hydraulic data by stream type.

=== Limitations ===
Problems with the use of the Rosgen Stream Classification are encountered with identifying [[Bankfull discharge|bankfull]] dimensions, particularly in [[incising]] channels and with the mixing of bed and bank sediment into a single population.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Its use for engineering design and restoration may be flawed by ignoring some processes governed by [[force]] and resistance, and the imbalance between [[Sediment transport|sediment]] supply and transporting power in unstable systems&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Limitations for Level II classification involve time dependence, uncertain applicability across physical environments, difficulty in identification of a true equilibrium condition, and uncertain process significance of classification criteria.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Juracek Kyle E., and Fitzpatrick Faith A. 2007. “Limitations and Implications of Stream Classification.” ''JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association'' 39 (3): 659–70. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2003.tb03683.x&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Implications of using the Rosgen Stream Classification, include: (1) acceptance of the limitations, (2) acceptance of the risk of classifying streams incorrectly, and (3) classification results may be used inappropriately&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The term '''safe space''' refers to places created for individuals who feel marginalized to come together to communicate regarding their experiences with [[marginalization]], most commonly located on university campuses in the western world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amenabar|first1=Teddy|title=The New Vocabulary of Protest|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/style/wp/2016/05/19/2016/05/19/what-college-students-mean-when-they-ask-for-safe-spaces-and-trigger-warnings/|accessdate=15 July 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but also at workplaces, as in the case of [[Nokia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://equal.org/safe-space-program/ The Safe Space Program] Alcatel lucent, n.d., acceessed 11 Nov 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms '''safe space''' (or '''safe-space'''), '''safer space''', and '''positive space''' may also indicate that a [[teacher]], educational institution or student body does not tolerate [[violence]], [[harassment]] or [[hate speech]], thereby creating a [[safety|safe]] place for all students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waldman |first=Katy |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/cover_story/2016/09/what_science_can_tell_us_about_trigger_warnings.html |title=What science can tell us about trigger warnings |website=Slate |date=2016-09-05 |accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Islamic Council of Victoria]] (ICV) which claims to represent 200,000 Muslims in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] stated that the Muslim community suffered mental health and other problems due to the suspicions to which it is subjected.

===Canada===
Positive Space initiatives have been prevalent in post-secondary institutions across Canada{{since when|date=November 2017}} including the [[University of Western Ontario]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Safe Campus|url=http://safecampus.uwo.ca/|title=Safe Campus|publisher=University of Western Ontario|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[McGill University]],{{cn|date=February 2018}} the [[University of Toronto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Office of Student Life|url=http://www.positivespace.utoronto.ca/|title=Positive Space Campaign|publisher=University of Toronto|accessdate=18 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AKkihV1Y?url=http://www.positivespace.utoronto.ca/|archivedate=31 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Algonquin College]],{{cn|date=February 2018}} the [[University of British Columbia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Positive Space|url=http://positivespace.ubc.ca/|title=The Positive Space Campaign|publisher=University of British Columbia|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Queen's University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Queen's Positive Space Program|url=http://www.queensu.ca/positivespace/|title=The Queen's Positive Space Program|publisher=Queen's University|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In early 2015 the increasing adoption of safe spaces in UK universities aroused controversy due to accusations that they were used to stifle free speech and differing political views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/feb/06/safe-space-or-free-speech-crisis-debate-uk-universities|work=The Guardian|title=Safe space or free speech? The crisis around debate at UK universities|date=6 February 2015|first=Ian|last=Dunt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, a member of the [[Edinburgh University Students' Association]] was subject to a vote on whether to be expelled from a meeting within a safe-space for violating rules about making gestures of disagreement; the vote went in her favour. She had waved her arms in disgust with a claim made against her by another speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mann|first1=Sebastian|title=Student 'violated university safe space rule... by raising her arm at a meeting'|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/student-violated-university-safe-space-rule-by-raising-her-arm-at-a-meeting-a3218101.html|accessdate=9 May 2016|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] hit out at universities for implementing "safe space" policies amid concerns that self-censorship is curtailing freedom of speech on campuses. The Prime Minister said it was "quite extraordinary" for universities to ban the discussion of certain topics which could cause offence. She warned that stifling free speech could have a negative impact on Britain's economic and social success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===United States===
In the United States the concept originated in the [[Feminist movement|women's movement]], where it "implies a certain license to speak and act freely, form collective strength, and generate strategies for resistance...a means rather than an end and not only a physical space but also a space created by the coming together of women searching for community." The first safe spaces were [[gay bar]]s and [[consciousness raising]] groups.&lt;ref name="Kenney"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kenney|first=Moira Rachel|title=Mapping Gay L.A.: The Intersection of Place and Politics|date=2001|page=24|isbn=1-56639-884-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Gay &amp; Lesbian Urban Explorers (GLUE) developed a safe spaces program. During their events including [[diversity-training]] sessions and [[antihomophobia]] workshops, they passed out magnets with an inverted [[pink triangle]], "[[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power|ACT UP]]'s...symbol", surrounded by a green circle to, "symbolize universal acceptance," and asked, "allies to display the magnets to show support for gay rights and to designate their work spaces free from homophobia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raeburn|first=Nicole C.|title=Changing Corporate America from Inside Out: Lesbian and Gay Workplace Rights|date=2004|page=209|isbn=0-8166-3999-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Advocates for Youth]] states on their website that a safe-space is "A place where anyone can relax and be fully self-expressed, without fear of being made to feel uncomfortable, unwelcome or challenged on account of biological sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, cultural background, age, or physical or mental ability; a place where the rules guard each person's self-respect, dignity and feelings and strongly encourage everyone to respect others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=607&amp;Itemid=177|title=Glossary|publisher=Advocates for Youth|accessdate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some people consider safe space culture as a violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and a mechanism for retreating from opinions which contrast with one's own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volanteonline.com/2016/09/38442/|title=Safe spaces disrupt the First Amendment|last=volanteonline|date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, these may be individuals or institutions which support a safe space for LGBT students and employees. They may offer or mandate staff training on diversity, include being a safe space in the organization's [[mission statement]], develop and post a value statement in the organization's office, online, or on printed documents, or, if part of a [[coalition]], encourage the coalition to include being a safe space in its mission and values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=496&amp;Itemid=177|title=Tips and Strategies for Creating a Safe Space for GLBTQ Youth|publisher=Advocates for Youth|accessdate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The idea of safe spaces has been criticized on the grounds that it stifles [[freedom of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/16/safe-spaces-free-speech-university-prevent-no-platforming-academic-freedom|title=Safe spaces are not the only threat to free speech|date=16 September 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://heatst.com/culture-wars/stephen-fry-campus-safe-spaces-are-stupid-and-infantile/|title=Stephen Fry: Campus Safe Spaces Are Stupid and Infantile|date=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spiked"&gt;{{cite web|title=The tyranny of safe spaces|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/the-tyranny-of-safe-spaces/17933|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2015, journalist [[Judith Shulevitz]] distinguished between meetings where participants mutually consent to provide a safe space, and attempts to make entire dormitories or student newspapers safe spaces. 

According to Shulevitz, the latter is a logical consequence of the former: "Once you designate some spaces as safe, you imply that the rest are unsafe. It follows that they should be made safer." She gave the example of a safe space at [[Brown University]], when libertarian [[Wendy McElroy]], who was known for criticizing the term "[[rape culture]]" was invited to give a speech: "The safe space ... was intended to give people who might find comments 'troubling' or 'triggering,' a place to recuperate. The room was equipped with cookies, coloring books, bubbles, Play-Doh, calming music, pillows, blankets and a video of frolicking puppies, as well as students and staff members trained to deal with trauma."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In College and Hiding From Scary Ideas |first=Judith |last=Shulevitz |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/opinion/sunday/judith-shulevitz-hiding-from-scary-ideas.html |newspaper=The New York Times |department=Op-ed |date=March 21, 2015 |accessdate=December 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, journalist [[Conor Friedersdorf]] criticized the use of outdoor safe spaces to block press coverage of student protests. According to Friedersdorf, such uses reverse the intent of safe spaces: "This behavior is a kind of safe-baiting: using intimidation or initiating physical aggression to violate someone's rights, then acting like your target is making you unsafe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Campus Activists Weaponize 'Safe Space'|last=Friedersdorf|first=Conor|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/how-campus-activists-are-weaponizing-the-safe-space/415080/|magazine=[[The Atlantic]] |department=Politics |date=November 10, 2015|accessdate=December 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, British actor and writer [[Stephen Fry]] criticized safe spaces and [[trigger warning]]s as infantilizing students and possibly eroding free speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/stephen-fry-speaks-about-erosion-of-free-speech-on-student-campuses_uk_570bb53de4b07a35187c5a96|title=Stephen Fry Speaks About Erosion Of ‘Free Speech’ On Student Campuses In Controversial Rubin Report Interview|last=George|first=Bowden|date=11 April 2016|work=HuffPost|access-date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Furedi]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and [[Candace Russell]] of ''[[HuffPost]]'' have similarly stated that safe spaces contribute to [[Echo chamber (media)|echo chambers]] surrounded by like minded people, insulating those inside said chambers from hostile or negative speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Furedi, Frank|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-furedi-safe-space-20170105-story.html|title=Campuses are breaking apart into 'safe spaces'|date=2017-01-05|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-04-27|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/candice-russell/safe-spaces-and-echo-cham_b_7043548.html|title=Safe Spaces and Echo Chambers, How Progressive Movements Stagnate Themselves| last=Russell|first=Candice|date=2015-04-13|website=[[HuffPost]]|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other known speakers who have criticized the concept of safe spaces include [[Christina Hoff Sommers]]&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Tyler (October 14, 2016). [https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=8258 "Safe spaces a 'recipe for fanaticism,' Hoff Sommers claims"]. Campus Reform.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Steven Crowder]].&lt;ref&gt;Howerton, Jason (April 26, 2016).

''[[TheBlaze]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Atlantic]]'' reported in 2016 that safe spaces were considered by some to be re-[[racial segregation|segregation]].&lt;ref&gt;Emily DeRuy[https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/08/finding-the-line-between-safe-space-and-segregation/496289/ The Fine Line Between Safe Space and Segregation] The Atlantic, Aug 17, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
"[[Safe Space (South Park)|Safe Space]]", a 2015 episode of the animated comedy series ''[[South Park]]'', [[parodied]] the concept of safe-spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Caffrey, Dan (October 22, 2015).

The country duo of [[Chad Prather]] and [[Steve McGrew|Steve "Mudflap" McGrew]] turned the 1990 [[Garth Brooks]] song "[[Friends in Low Places]]" into "[[Friends in Safe Spaces]]", which parodied the practice.{{Cn|date=January 2018}}

[[File:A cosmic sense of scale.webm|thumb|This animation gives a sense of the awe-inspiring scale of some of the known objects in our universe.]]

In sciences such as [[physics]], [[geography]], [[astronomy]], [[meteorology]] and [[statistics]], the term '''scale''' or '''spatial scale''' is used for describing or classifying with large approximation the extent or size of a length, distance or area studied or described. For instance, in physics an object or phenomenon can be called microscopic if too small to be visible. In [[climatology]], a [[micro-climate]] is a [[climate]] which might occur in a [[mountain]], [[valley]] or near a lake shore, whereas in [[statistics]] a megatrend is a political, social, economical, environmental or technological [[Trend (statistics)|trend]] which involves the whole [[planet]] or is supposed to last a very large amount of time.

In physics, the concept of scale is closely related to the more accurate concept of [[order of magnitude]].

These divisions are somewhat arbitrary; where, on this table, ''mega-'' is assigned global scope, it may only apply continentally or even regionally in other contexts. The interpretations of ''meso-'' and ''macro-'' must then be adjusted accordingly.

[[File:Iván Ernesto Gómez Carrasco en la cima del Monte Everest.jpg|thumb|Climbers on the world's highest summit, Mount [[Mount Everest|Everest]].]]
[[File:Monte Rosa summit.jpg|thumb|View from the summit of [[Switzerland]]'s highest, [[Monte Rosa]]]]

A '''summit''' is a point on a surface that is higher in [[elevation]] than all points immediately adjacent to it. [[Mathematics|Mathematically]], a summit is a local [[Maxima and minima|maximum]] in elevation.  The [[topography|topographic]] terms "acme", "apex", [[Pyramidal peak|"peak"]], and "[[zenith]]" are [[synonymous]].

==Definition==
The term "{{vanchor|top}}" is generally used only for a [[mountain]] peak that is located some distance from the nearest point of higher elevation. For example, a big massive rock next to the main summit of a mountain is not considered a summit. Summits near a higher peak, with some prominence or isolation, but not reaching a certain cutoff value for the quantities, are often considered ''subsummits'' (or ''subpeaks'') of the higher peak, and are considered part of the same mountain. A [[pyramidal peak]] is an exaggerated form produced by ice [[erosion]] of a mountain top.
Summit may also refer to the highest point along a line, trail, or route.

The highest summit in the world is Everest with height of 8844.43 m above [[sea level]] (29,029 ft). The first official ascent was made by [[Tenzing_Norgay|Tenzing Norgay]] and [[Sir Edmund Hillary]]. They reached the mountain`s peak in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/21/part-of-mount-everest-has-collapsed-mountaineers-confirm|title=Mount Everest's Hillary Step has collapsed, mountaineer confirms|last=Lyons|first=Kate|date=2017-05-21|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/everest/|title=Everest|work=[[National Geographic]]|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UIAA]] definition is that a summit is independent if it has a prominence of {{convert|30|m|ft|lk=on}} or more; it is a mountain if it has a prominence of at least {{convert|300|m|ft}}. This can be summarised as follows:

In many parts of the western United States, the term ''summit'' refers to the highest point along a road, highway, or railroad. For example, the highest point along [[Interstate 80]] in [[California]] is referred to as [[Donner Summit]] and the highest point on [[Interstate 5]] is [[Siskiyou Summit|Siskiyou Mountain Summit]].

==Summit climbing equipment==
A summit climbing differs from the common [[mountaineering]]. Summit expedition requires: 1+ year of training, a good physical shape, and a [[Climbing gear|special gear]]. Although a huge part of climber’s stuff can be left and taken at the base camps or given to porters, there is a long list of personal equipment. In addition to common mountaineers’ gear, Summit climbers need to take [[Diamox]] (anti-altitude sickness medication), masks, and bottles of [[oxygen]]. There are also special requirements for [[crampons]], [[ice axe]], rappel device, clothing, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13082">Many [[animal]]s are able to [[animal navigation|navigate]] using the [[Sun]] as a [[compass]]. Orientation cues from the [[position of the Sun]] in the sky are combined with an indication of time from the animal's [[circadian clock|internal clock]].

There is evidence that some [[animal navigation|animals can navigate]] using celestial cues, such as the [[position of the Sun]]. Since the Sun apparently moves in the sky, [[celestial navigation|navigation]] by this means also requires an internal clock. Many animals depend on such a clock to maintain their [[circadian rhythm]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunlap, J.C.; Loros, J.; DeCoursey, P.J. (2003). ''Chronobiology: Biological Timekeeping''. Sinauer, Sunderland.&lt;/ref&gt; Animals that use sun compass orientation are [[fish]], birds, [[sea turtle]]s, [[butterfly|butterflies]], [[bee]]s, [[sandhopper]]s, [[reptile]]s, and [[ant]]s.&lt;ref name=Alcock140&gt;{{Cite book |title=Animal Behavior: An Evolutionary Approach |last=Alcock |first=John |publisher=Sinauer Associates |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-87893-225-2 |pages=140–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sun compass orientation is using the Sun's position in the sky as a directional guide.&lt;ref name="Alcock140" /&gt; The [[azimuth]] can be used along with sun compass orientation to help animals navigate. The Sun's azimuth can be defined as the direction of a [[celestial object]] from the observer, expressed as the [[angular distance]] from the north or south point of the [[horizon]] to the point at which a vertical circle passing through the object intersects the horizon.

==Purpose of sun compass orientation==
[[File:Talitrus saltator 2c.jpg|thumb|The [[Talitrus saltator|sandhopper]] uses the sun and its [[Circadian rhythm|internal clock]] to determine direction.]]

Sun compass orientation can be used as a daily guide for animals but for some, including sea turtles, they use the sun as a migratory guide. Turtles use the sun’s azimuth compensation schedule in order to find their specific breeding locations each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.science.fau.edu/biology/faculty/Mott%20&amp;%20Salmon.pdf|title = Sun Compass Orientation by Juvenile Green Sea Turtles (Chelonia mydas)|last = Mott|first = Cody R.|date = 2011|journal = Chelonian Conservation and Biology|doi = |pmid = |accessdate = 9 December 2015|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151210212615/http://www.science.fau.edu/biology/faculty/Mott%20%26%20Salmon.pdf|archivedate = 10 December 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandhoppers use the sun daily to determine where their home lays. With this experiment a group of sandhoppers were subjected to six hours of artificial lights and their movements were monitored when exposed to normal sunlight. The sandhopper's orientation when finally exposed to normal sunlight, showed that their [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]] was off by 90 degrees when in respect to their home. This study helped show how an artificial light can alter the species relationship to the sun and how it can throw off the species basic directional abilities &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00359-007-0277-z|title = Locomotor activity rhythm and sun compass orientation in the sandhopper Talitrus saltator are related|last = Ugolini|first = Alberto|date = December 2007|journal = Journal of Comparative Physiology A|doi = 10.1007/s00359-007-0277-z|pmid = |accessdate = 9 December 2015|volume=193|pages=1259–1263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of high elevations, sun compass decreases its precision when providing information to animals. A study was performed to see if dung beetles respond better to orientations provided by the sun compass or [[skylight compass]]. The results of this study showed that dung beetles use their original bearings (i.e. sun compass) a majority of the time and rarely use skylight compass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/369/1636/20130036.short|title = The role of the sun in the celestial compass of dung beetles|last = Dacke|first = M.|date = 6 January 2014|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B|doi = 10.1098/rstb.2013.0036|pmid = |accessdate = 9 December 2015|volume=369|pages=20130036|pmc = 3886324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish larva find safety in the [[coral reef]]s for predators. The particular coral reef is one that the larva have been to before. The larva can recognize the area by the smell, sound, and direction of the particular reef. Fish larvae drift away from the reef and swim in order to relocate their reef. They use sun compass as one of their tools. Different cues are learned and remembered by the fish larva which allows them to return to their reef. It was also concluded that the learning process happens when the fish larvae are young and location can be memorized and become second nature. This is a useful tool that helps fish larva return to their respective reefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066039|title = Sun Compass Orientation Helps Coral Reef Fish Larvae Return to Their Natal Reef|last = Mouritsen|first = Henrik|date = 26 June 2013|journal = PLOS ONE|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0066039|pmid = 23840396|accessdate = 9 December 2015|volume=8|pages=e66039|pmc=3694079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Desert ants]] use sun compass as a reference to the amount of walking distance to their specific destination. Ants, like bees, compensate for the sun’s daily movements as it moves and rotates about the Earth. They communicate to other ants who have already been out and base their directions on the direction they should go. In addition to sun compass, insects such as ants also use a tool called azimuthal position of the sun. These are additional cues determined by ants and passed on to other ants when they communicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Interactions of the polarization and the sun compass in path integration of desert ants|last = Lebhardt|first = F.|date = 15 Dec 2012|journal = Journal of Comparative Physiology A|doi = 10.1007/s00359-013-0871-1|pmid = 24337416|accessdate = |volume=200|pages=711–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies analyzing sun compass orientation==

[[Sandhopper]]s (such as ''[[Talitrus saltator]]'', also called sand fleas) are small shrimp-like crustaceans that live on beaches. When taken off a beach, they easily find their way back down to the sea. An experiment described by Lockley showed that this was not simply by moving downhill or towards the sight or sound of the sea. A group of sandhoppers were acclimatised to a day/night cycle under artificial lighting, whose timing was gradually changed until it was 12 hours out of phase with the natural cycle. Then, the sandhoppers were placed on the beach in natural sunlight. They moved roughly 180° from the correct direction down to the sea, up the beach. The experiment implied that the sandhoppers use the sun and their internal clock to determine their heading, and that they had learnt the actual direction down to the sea on their particular beach.&lt;ref name=LockleySky&gt;Lockley, 1967. page 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lockley's experiments with [[Manx shearwater]]s (''Puffinus puffinus'') showed that when released "under a clear sky" far from their nests (in Skokholm), the seabirds first oriented themselves and then "flew off in a direct line for Skokholm", making the journey rapidly. For example, one of the birds, released at Boston airport, arrived in Skokholm 12½ days later; Lockley calculated that if the birds flew for 12 hours per day, they must have travelled at 20 miles per hour, their full normal speed, so they could not have deviated significantly from a straight line course or searched at random for their destination. The birds behaved like this regardless of whether the direct heading took the birds over sea or land. But if the sky was overcast at the time of release, the shearwaters flew around in circles "as if lost" and returned slowly or not at all. Lockley therefore concluded that it was essential for the birds that "at the moment of release the sun was visible by day, or the stars by night". Lockley did not claim to understand how the birds knew their position relative to their destination, but merely observed that they behaved as if they did know it.&lt;ref name=LockleyShearwaterNav&gt;{{cite book | last= Lockley | first=Ronald M. | title=Shearwaters | year=1942 | publisher=J. M. Dent | pages=114–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study demonstrated that [[Monarch butterfly|monarch butterflies]] use the sun as a compass to guide their southwesterly autumn migration from [[Canada]] to [[Mexico]]. Migrating butterflies were captured and held for cycles of 12 hours of light and 12 of dark. One group's light began each day at 7:00&amp;nbsp;am, while the other group's began 6 hours earlier at 1:00&amp;nbsp;am. The monarchs were held in captivity for a few days and then released in a flight cage under natural daylight conditions. This allowed them to fly in the direction that they wanted to go while keeping them in the test arena. The butterflies that had their biological clocks set to the natural fall cycle (lights turned on at 7:00&amp;nbsp;am) tried to fly to the southwest, while those whose clocks had been shifted 6 hours earlier oriented 90 degrees toward the left.&lt;ref name=Alcock140/&gt;

The ability of birds to tune their compensation mechanisms so well to the true changes in sun azimuth suggests that the respective processes of pre-programmed learning are generating a sun azimuth/time/direction function that reflects the true sun azimuth curve very closely. It suggests that birds record the sun’s direction at rather short intervals and store this information together with the information on time in their memory. A study performed testing the sun compass orientation in pigeons showed that animals must compensate for the movement of the sun with their internal clocks. The sun’s azimuth plays an important role in doing so. The azimuth allows the birds to tell the time of day, and ultimately determine which direction to go for reasons such as migration or possible sources of food.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Results of experiment |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MiamiCaptionURL&amp;_method=retrieve&amp;_eid=1-s2.0-S0003347214003418&amp;_image=1-s2.0-S0003347214003418-gr1.jpg&amp;_cid=272524&amp;_explode=defaultEXP_LIST&amp;_idxType=defaultREF_WORK_INDEX_TYPE&amp;_alpha=defaultALPHA&amp;_ba=&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=FULL&amp;_issn=00033472&amp;_pii=S0003347214003418&amp;md5=548285508ef65ef4fc34be1573a1b134 |accessdate=9 December 2015 | doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.09.005 |volume=97 |year=2014 |journal=Animal Behaviour |pages=135–143 | last1 = Guilford | first1 = Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==

For some animals, the sun is a form of visual stimulus used as a tool for navigation. As seen in birds and bees, the animal will orient their body at a certain angle in relation to the sun and the time of day. This external stimuli activates a portion of the brain (in necessary for navigation and allows the organism to adjust their orientation in relation to the sun). That is to say, if the animal leaves its nest in the morning when the sun is low in the sky and plans to head in a known direction, the animal will travel in a certain direction with the sun in a position related to its body (e.g. to travel West, the sun could be on the animal's right side during navigation). This form of navigation is not as simple as observing a stimulus and acting accordingly. Studies have shown that animals may use other "tricks" like the length and direction of shadows to determine where the sun is during time shifts and then calculate the direction they should travel. For example, above the [[Tropic of Cancer]], the sun will always be South at its zenith (highest point) so short shadows will point North.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214003418|title = The sun compass revisited|last = Guilford|first = Tim|date = 2 October 2014|journal = Animal Behaviour Research Group|doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.09.005|pmid = |accessdate = 9 December 2015|volume=97|pages=135–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals tend to incorporate several types of navigation techniques, like magnetic orientation and landmarks, to their repertoire in order to perform normal navigation or to migrate.

When animals use the sun for compass orientation, they must compensate for the apparent movement of the sun with the help of their [[Circadian clock|internal clock]]. Animals associate the sun azimuth with time of day provided by their internal clock and a reference direction provided by their magnetic compass.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://jeb.biologists.org/content/jexbio/203/5/889.full.pdf|title = Sun-Compass Orientation in Homing Pigeons: Compensation for Different Rates of Change in Azimuth?|last = Wiltschko|first = Roswitha|date = 10 February 2000|journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology|doi = |pmid = |accessdate = 9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[surveying]], '''[[tape measure|tape]] correction(s)''' refer(s) to correcting measurements for the effect of slope angle, expansion or contraction due to temperature, and the tape's sag, which varies with the applied tension. Not correcting for these effects gives rise to [[systematic error]]s, i.e. effects which act in a predictable manner and therefore can be corrected by mathematical methods.

== Correction due to slope ==
[[File:Diagram of simple slope correction.svg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the slope line and the horizontal line, ''s'' is the slope distance measured between two points on the slope line, ''h'' is the height of the slope.]]


&lt;math&gt;C_v =2L*sin^2 + \frac {A}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Where 
           L= Inclined length measured
           A= Inclined angle



When distances are measured along the [[slope]], the equivalent horizontal distance may be determined by applying a slope correction.

The vertical slope angle of the length measured must be measured. (Refer to the figure on the other side) Thus,

:*For gentle slopes, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;20\%&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;C_h = \frac {h^2}{2s}&lt;/math&gt;

:*For steep slopes, &lt;math&gt;20\%\le m \le 30\%&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;C_h = \frac {h^2}{2s} + \frac {h^4}{8s^3}&lt;/math&gt;

:*For very steep slopes, &lt;math&gt;m&gt;30\%&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;C_h = s(1-\cos \theta)&lt;/math&gt;,
::Or, more simply, &lt;math&gt;d = s * \cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:'''&lt;math&gt;C_h&lt;/math&gt;''' is the correction of measured slope distance due to slope;
:'''&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;''' is the angle between the measured slope line and horizontal line;
:'''s''' is the measured slope distance.
:'''d''' is the horizontal distance.

The correction &lt;math&gt;C_h&lt;/math&gt; is subtracted from &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; to obtain the equivalent horizontal distance on the slope line:

:&lt;math&gt;d = s - C_h&lt;/math&gt;

== Correction due to temperature ==
When measuring or laying out distances, the standard [[temperature]] of the tape and the temperature of the tape at time of measurement are usually different. A difference in temperature will cause the tape to lengthen or shorten, so the measurement taken will not be exactly correct. A correction can be applied to the measured length to obtain the correct length.

The correction of the tape length due to change in temperature is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;C_t = C \cdot L (T_m - T_s)&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;C_t&lt;/math&gt; is the correction to be applied to the tape due to temperature;
:'''C''' is the [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] of the metal that forms the tape;
:'''L''' is the length of the tape or length of the line measured.
:&lt;math&gt;T_m&lt;/math&gt; is the observed temperature of the tape at the time of measurement;
:&lt;math&gt;T_s&lt;/math&gt; is the standard temperature, when the tape is at the correct length, often 20&amp;nbsp;°C;

The correction &lt;math&gt;C_t&lt;/math&gt; is added to &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; to obtain the corrected distance:

:&lt;math&gt;d = L + C_t&lt;/math&gt;

For common tape measurements, the tape used is a [[steel tape]] with [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] C equal to 0.000,011,6 units per unit length per degree [[Celsius]] change. This means that the tape changes length by 1.16&amp;nbsp;mm per 10 m tape per 10&amp;nbsp;°C change from the standard temperature of the tape. For a 30 meter long tape with standard temperature of 20&amp;nbsp;°C used at 40&amp;nbsp;°C, the change in length is 7 mm over the length of the tape.

== Correction due to sag ==
A tape not supported along its length will sag and form a [[catenary]] between end supports. The correction due to sag must be calculated separately for each unsupported stretch separately and is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;C_s = \frac {{\omega}^2 L^3}{24P^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;C_s&lt;/math&gt; is the correction applied to the tape due to sag; meters;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the weight of the tape per unit length; newtons per meter;
:'''L''' is the length between the two ends of the catenary; meters;
:'''P''' is the tension or pull applied to the tape; newtons.

A tape held in catenary will record a value larger than the correct measurement. Thus, the correction &lt;math&gt;C_s&lt;/math&gt; is subtracted from &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; to obtain the corrected distance:

:&lt;math&gt;d = L - C_s&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the weight of the tape per unit length is equal to the weight of the tape divided by the length of the tape:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac {W}{L}&lt;/math&gt;

so: &lt;math&gt;W = \omega L&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, we can rewrite the formula for correction due to sag as:

:&lt;math&gt;C_s = \frac {W^2 L}{24 P^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Derivation (sag)===
The general formula for a [[Catenary#Mathematical description|catenary]] formed by a tape supported only at its ends is

:&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{P}{\omega g} \cosh \left(\frac{x \omega g}{P}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Here, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational acceleration. The [[Arc length#Finding arc lengths by integrating|arc length]] between two support points at &lt;math&gt;x=-k/2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x=+k/2&lt;/math&gt; is found by usual methods via integration:

:&lt;math&gt;L = \int_{-k/2}^{+k/2} \sqrt{1+\left(dy/dx\right)^2} \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

For convenience set &lt;math&gt;a=\frac{P}{\omega g}&lt;/math&gt;. The integrand is simplified as follows using [[Hyperbolic function#Useful relations|hyperbolic function identities]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1+\left(dy/dx\right)^2} = \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{d}{dx}\left(a \cosh\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)\right)\right)^2} = \sqrt{1+\sinh^2\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)} = \cosh\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The tape length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is then found by integrating:

:&lt;math&gt;L = \int_{-k/2}^{+k/2} \cosh\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) dx = \left[a \sinh\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)\right]_{x=-k/2}^{x=+k/2} = \left(2a\right) \sinh\left(\frac{k}{2a}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

Now the correction for tape sag is the difference between the actual span between the supports, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and the arc length of the tape's catenary, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. Call this correction &lt;math&gt;\delta = k - L&lt;/math&gt;. The absolute value of this &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; correction is &lt;math&gt;C_s&lt;/math&gt; above, the amount you would subtract from the tape measurement to get the true span distance.

A [[Taylor series]] expansion of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the quantity &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is desired to give a good first approximation to the correction. In fact, the first nonvanishing term in the Taylor series is cubic in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, and the next nonvanishing term is to the fifth power of L; thus, a series expansion for &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is reasonable. To this end, we need to find an expression for &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; that contains &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; but not &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. We already have an expression for &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, but now need to find the inverse function (for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{2a} = \sinh\left(\frac{k}{2a}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sinh^{-1}\left(\frac{L}{2a}\right)= \frac{k}{2a} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;k = \left(2a\right) \sinh^{-1}\left(\frac{L}{2a}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta = k - L = \left(2a\right) \sinh^{-1}\left(\frac{L}{2a}\right) - L &lt;/math&gt;

Evaluating &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;L=0&lt;/math&gt; yields zero, so there is no zero-order term in the Taylor series. The first derivative of this function with respect to L is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\delta}{dL} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{L^2}{4 a^2}+1}}-1 &lt;/math&gt;.

Evaluated at L=0, it vanishes and so does not contribute a Taylor series term. The second derivative of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2\delta}{{dL}^2} = -\frac{L}{4 a^2 \left(\frac{L^2}{4 a^2}+1\right)^{3/2}} &lt;/math&gt;.

Again, when evaluated at L=0 it vanishes. When evaluated at L=0, the third derivative survives, however.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^3\delta}{{dL}^3} = -\frac{ \left(8 a^3-4\text{aL}^2\right)}{\left(4 a^2+L^2\right)^{5/2} } &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the first surviving term in the Taylor series is:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta \cong \left[\frac{d^3\delta}{{dL}^3}\right]_{L=0} \frac{ L^3}{3!} = -\frac{1}{4a^2} \frac{L^3}{6} = \frac{-L^3}{24a^2} = \frac{-L^3 \omega^2 g^2}{24 P^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the variable &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; here is the tension on the cable, whereas above, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the mass whose gravitational force (mass times gravitational acceleration) equals the tension on the cable. The only conversion necessary then is to take &lt;math&gt;P/g&lt;/math&gt; here and equate it to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; above. Also, this formula is the tape sag correction to be added to the measured distance, so the negative sign in front can be removed and the tape sag correction can be made instead by subtracting the absolute value as is done in the preceding section.

=== Correction due to tension ===
Some tapes are already calibrated to account for the sag at a standard tension.{{cn|date=September 2016}} In this case, errors arise when the tape is pulled at a [[Tension (physics)|Tension]] which differs from the standard tension used at standardization. The tape will stretch less than its standard length when a tension less than the standard tension is applied, making the tape too short.

A tape stretches in an elastic manner until it reaches its [[Yield (engineering)|elastic limit]], when it will deform permanently and ruin the tape.

The correction due to tension is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;C_p = \frac{(P_m - P_s)L}{AE}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; is the elongation in tape length due to pull; or the correction to be applied due to applying a tension which differs from standard tension; meters;
:&lt;math&gt;P_m&lt;/math&gt; is the tension applied to the tape during measurement; newtons;
:&lt;math&gt;P_s&lt;/math&gt; is the standard tension, when the tape is the correct length, often 50 newtons; newtons;
:'''L''' is the measured or erroneous length of the line; meters
:'''A''' is the cross-sectional area of the tape; square centimeters;
:'''E''' is the [[Elastic modulus|modulus of elasticity]] of the tape material; newtons per square centimeter;

The correction &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; is added to &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; to obtain the corrected distance:

:&lt;math&gt;d = L + C_p&lt;/math&gt;

The value for A is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac {W}{(L)(U_w)}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:'''W''' is the total weight of the tape; kilograms;
:&lt;math&gt;U_w&lt;/math&gt; is the unit weight of the tape; kilograms per cubic centimeter.

For steel tapes, the value for &lt;math&gt;U_w&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;7.866 \times 10^{-3} kg/cm^3&lt;/math&gt;.

==Correction due to incorrect tape length==
Manufacturers of measuring tapes do not usually guarantee the exact length of tapes, and [[standardization]] is a process where a standard temperature and tension are determined at which the tape is the exact length. The nominal length of tapes can be affected by physical imperfections, stretching or wear. Constant use of tapes cause wear, tapes can become kinked and may be improperly repaired when breaks occur.

The correction due to tape length is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;C_L = Corr \times M_L &lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:'''C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the corrected length of the line to be measured or laid out;
:'''M&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the measured length or length to be laid out;
:'''N&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the nominal length of the tape as specified by its mark;
:'''K&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''' is a known length;
:'''Corr''' is the ratio of measured to actual length &lt;math&gt;\frac {M_L}{K_L}&lt;/math&gt;, determined by measuring a known length. 

In the U.S., some tapes come with [[United States Bureau of Standards]] certifications establishing the correction needed per 100' of tape.

Note that incorrect tape length introduces a systematic error that must be calibrated periodically.

Punmia|author2= Ashok Kumar Jain|date=2005|publisher=Firewall Media|isbn=81-7008-853-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used in [[geodesy]]. Traverse networks involve placing survey stations along a line or path of travel, and then using the previously surveyed points as a base for observing the next point. Traverse networks have many advantages, including:

* Less reconnaissance and organization needed;
* While in other systems, which may require the survey to be performed along a rigid [[polygon]] shape, the traverse can change to any shape and thus can accommodate a great deal of different terrains;
* Only a few observations need to be taken at each station, whereas in other survey networks a great deal of angular and linear observations need to be made and considered;
* Traverse networks are free of the strength of figure considerations that happen in triangular systems;
* Scale error does not add up as the traverse is performed. Azimuth swing errors can also be reduced by increasing the distance between stations.

The traverse is more accurate than [[triangulateration]]&lt;ref&gt;Chrzanowski and Konecny, (1965); Adler and Schmutter (1971).&lt;/ref&gt; (a combined function of the [[triangulation]] and [[trilateration]] practice).&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Wilfred (2001). ''Engineering Surveying.''Butterworth-Heinemann. {{ISBN|978-0-7506-4987-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Frequently in [[surveying|surveying engineering]] and [[Geodesy|geodetic science]], control points (CP) are setting/observing distance and direction ([[Bearing (navigation)|bearings]], [[angle]]s, [[azimuth]]s, and [[elevation]]). The CP throughout the control network may consist of [[monument]]s, [[Benchmark (surveying)|benchmarks]], [[Sea Level Datum of 1929|vertical control]], etc.There are mainly two types of traverse.Traverse may be either a closed traverse or an open traverse.
1.Closed traverse: the traverse which either originates from a station and returns to the same station completing a circuit or runs between two known stations,is called a closed traverse.
 2. Open traverse: the traverse which neither returns to its starting station nor closes on any other known station,is called open traverse.                                                                                                                                                     [[File:Open traverse.png|thumb|250px|Diagram of an open traverse]]
[[File:Close traverse.png|thumb|250px|Diagram of a closed traverse]]

===Compound===
A compound traverse is where an open traverse is linked at its ends to an existing traverse to form a closed traverse. The closing line may be defined by coordinates at the end points which have been determined by previous survey. The difficulty is, where there is linear misclosure, it is not known whether the error is in the new survey or the previous survey.

'''Turn-by-turn Navigation''' is a feature of some [[GPS navigation device]]s where directions for a selected route are continually presented to the user in the form of spoken or visual instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of transport systems and traffic control |last=Button |first=Kenneth J. |author2=David A.

Mathematically, turn by turn navigation is based on the [[shortest path problem]] within [[graph theory]], which examines how to identify the path that best meets some criteria (shortest, cheapest, fastest, etc.) between two points in a large network.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2938">USBL ('''ultra-short baseline''', also sometimes known as '''SSBL''' for super short base line) is a [[Underwater Acoustic Positioning System|method of underwater acoustic positioning]]. A complete USBL system consists of a [[transceiver]], which is mounted on a pole under a ship, and a [[Transponder|transponder or responder]] on the seafloor, on a [[towfish]], or on an [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]]. A computer, or "topside unit", is used to calculate a position from the ranges and bearings measured by the transceiver.

An [[Acoustics|acoustic]] pulse is transmitted by the transceiver and detected by the subsea transponder, which replies with its own acoustic pulse. This return pulse is detected by the shipboard transceiver. The time from the transmission of the initial acoustic pulse until the reply is detected is measured by the USBL system and is converted into a range.

To calculate a subsea position, the USBL calculates both a range and an angle from the transceiver to the [[subsea]] beacon. Angles are measured by the transceiver, which contains an array of [[transducers]]. The transceiver head normally contains three or more transducers separated by a baseline of 10&amp;nbsp;cm or less. A method called “[[Phase difference|phase-differencing]]” within this [[Microphone array|transducer array]] is used to calculate the direction to the subsea transponder.

USBLs have also begun to find use in "inverted" (iUSBL) configurations, with the transceiver mounted on an [[autonomous underwater vehicle]], and the transponder on the target. In this case, the "topside" processing happens inside the vehicle to allow it to locate the transponder for applications such as [[automatic docking]] and [[Tracking system|target tracking]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3550">{{Semiotics}}
'''Urban semiotics''' is the study of meaning in urban form as generated by signs, symbols, and their social connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keller, Suzanne |title=Review |journal=Contemporary Sociology, Vol. 17, No. 3. (May, 1988), pp. 346-348 |jstor=2069642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most urban semiotic theory is based on [[social semiotics]], which considers social connotations, including meanings related to ideology and power structures, in addition to denotative meanings of signs.  As such, urban semiotics focuses on material objects of the built environment, such as streets, squares, parks, and buildings, but also unbuilt cultural products such as building codes, planning documents, unbuilt designs, real estate advertising, and popular discourse about the city,&lt;ref&gt;Gottdiener, M., and Lagopoulos, Alexandros, eds.  ''The City and the Sign: An Introduction to Urban Semiotics'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1986.  p.5&lt;/ref&gt; such as architectural criticism and real estate blogs.

Theorists who take a social semiotic approach to urban semiotics define their discipline in opposition to the methods of [[behavioral geography]], beginning with the work of [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]] in ''The Image of the City'', which they criticize for being limited by its exclusive focus on the denotative level of communication (recognition of spatial elements, such as paths, as conceptual objects), ignoring the connotative meanings associated with urban forms; instead, urban semioticians argue that urban structures often become recognizable because they have symbolic meaning beyond their functional meanings.  The social semiotic approach to urban semiotics also grew out of a critique of architectural semiotics, which was perceived to be overly attached to linguistic models of semiosis and thus unable to adequately consider the social connotations of signs.&lt;ref&gt;Gottdiener and Lagopoulos, 1986. p.6-13&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theorists have used semiotic models in empirical studies of the construction of meaning in urban environments.  Raymond Ledrut has used questionnaires and interviews about viewers' responses to sets of photographs in order to examine the role of class in shaping mental models of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Ledrut, Raymond.  “The Images of the City,” in ''The City and the Sign: An Introduction to Urban Semiotics'', Gottdienier, M., and Lagopoulos, Alexandros, eds.  New York: Columbia University Press, 1986.  p.219-240.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Martin Krampen]] conducted studies of photograph recognition in order to discover the level of facade detail required to identify building types, and to examine the role of socioeconomic status in shaping preference for building styles.&lt;ref&gt;Krampen, M.  ''Meaning in the Urban Environment''.  London: Pion, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;
