      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7050">'''Aesthetics of nature''' is a sub-field of [[ethics|philosophical ethics]], and refers to the study of natural objects from their [[aesthetics|aesthetical]] perspective.

==History==
Aesthetics of nature developed as a sub-field of philosophical ethics. In the 18th and 19th century, the aesthetics of nature advanced the concepts of disinterestedness, the pictures, and the introduction of the idea of positive aesthetics.&lt;ref name=Carlson2012&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first major developments of nature occurred in the 18th century. The concept of disinterestedness had been explained by many thinkers. [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley-Cooper]] introduced the concept as a way of characterizing the notion of the aesthetic, later magnified by [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], who expanded it to exclude personal and utilitarianism interests and associations of a more general nature from aesthetic experience.&lt;ref name=Stolnitz1961&gt;

  |title=Of the Origins of ‘Aesthetic Disinterestedness’
  |journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism
  |volume=20|pages=131–143
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This concept was further developed by [[Archibald Alison (author)|Archibald Alison]] who referred it to a particular state of mind.&lt;ref name=Stolnitz1961/&gt;

==Theories==
The theory of disinterestedness opened doors for a better understanding of the aesthetics dimensions of nature in terms of three conceptualizations: 
# The idea of beautiful: this applied to tamed and cultivated European gardens and landscapes&lt;ref name=Carlson2012/&gt;
# The idea of the sublime: this explained the threatening and terrifying side of nature such as mountains and wilderness; however, when it is viewed through the disinterestedness perspective, it can be aesthetically appreciated rather than feared or neglected&lt;ref name=Carlson2012/&gt;
# The notion of the picturesque: the term "picturesque" means "picture-like", where the natural world is experienced as if it is divided into art-like scenes&lt;ref name=Carlson2012/&gt;

Objects experienced as beautiful tend to be small, smooth, and fair in color.&lt;ref name=Conron2000&gt;
{{cite book

  |publisher=[[Pennsylvania State University Press]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17–18}} In contrast, objects viewed as sublime tend to be powerful, intense and terrifying. Picturesque items are a mixture of both, which can be seen as varied and irregular, rich and forceful, and even vibrant.&lt;ref name=Conron2000/&gt;{{rp|17–18}}

==21st century developments==

Cognitive and non-cognitive approaches of nature have directed their focus from natural environments to the consideration of human and human influenced environments and developed aesthetic investigations of everyday life.(Carlson and Lintott, 2007; Parsons 2008a; Carlson 2010){{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Human Perspectives and Relationship with Nature==
People may be mistaken by the [[objet d'art|art object]] analogy. For instance, a [[sandhill crane]] is not an art object; an art object is not a sandhill crane. In fact, an art object should be called an ''artifact''.&lt;ref name=Rolston2002&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crane is wildlife on its own and is not an art object. This can be related to Satio's definition of the cognitive view. In elaboration, the crane lives through various ecosystems such as Yellowstone. Nature is a living system which includes animals, plants, and Eco-systems. In contrast, an art object has no regeneration, evolutionary history, or metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; An individual may be in the forest and perceive it as beautiful because of the plethora of colors such as red, green, and yellow. This is a result of the chemicals interacting with chlorophyll.&lt;ref name=Leopold&gt;

  |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]
  |pages=224–225
}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's aesthetic experience may increase; however, none of the things mentioned have anything to do with what is really going on in the forest. The chlorophyll is capturing solar energy and the residual chemicals protect the trees from insect grazing.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt;

Any color perceived by human visitors for a few hours is entirely different from what is really happening.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt;  According to Leopold, the three features of [[ecosystem]]s that generate land ethic are integrity, stability and beauty.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt; None of the mentioned features are real in nature.  Ecosystems are not stable: they are dramatically changing and they have little integration; ergo, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt;

==Objectives==
In a Post-Modern approach, when an individual engages in aesthetically appreciating a natural thing, we give meaning to the thing we appreciate and in that meaning, we express and develop our own attitudes, values and beliefs.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008&gt;
{{cite book
  |last=Parsons|first=G.
  |title=Aesthetics and Nature
  |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]
  |year=2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our interest in natural things are not only a passive reflection of our inclinations, as Croce describes as the appreciation of nature as looking in a mirror, or what we might call our inward life; but may instead be the things we come across in nature that engage and stimulate our imagination.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008/&gt; As a result, we are challenged to think differently and apply thoughts and associations to in new situations and ways.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008/&gt;
 
As a characterization of the appreciation of art, nature aestheticists argue that post modernism is a mistaken view because we do not have a case of anything goes.The aesthetics appreciation of art is governed by some normative standards.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008/&gt; In the world of art, criticism may take place when people come together and discuss books and films or critics write appraisals for publications. On the contrary, there are not obvious instances of debate and appraisals where different judgments about the aesthetics of character of nature are evaluated.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[measurement uncertainty|uncertainty]] has been narrowed down to 21 million years, based on a number of projects that all give extremely close figures for the age. These include studies of the [[microwave background radiation]], and [[measurement]]s by the [[Planck satellite]], the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] and other probes.

== Explanation ==
The [[Lambda-CDM model|Lambda-CDM concordance model]] describes the evolution of the universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state over a span of about 13.8 billion years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |date=2 April 2013

}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[cosmological time]]. This model is well understood theoretically and strongly supported by recent high-precision [[astronomical observation]]s such as [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]]. In contrast, theories of the origin of the primordial state remain very speculative. If one extrapolates the Lambda-CDM model backward from the earliest well-understood state, it quickly (within a small fraction of a second) reaches a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]]. This is known as the "[[initial singularity]]" or the "[[Big Bang]] singularity". This singularity is not understood as having a physical significance in the usual sense, but it is convenient to quote times measured "since the Big Bang" even though they do not correspond to a physically measurable time. For example, "10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang" is a well-defined era in the universe's evolution. If one referred to the same era as "13.8 billion years minus 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds ago", the precision of the meaning would be lost because the minuscule latter time interval is eclipsed by uncertainty in the former.

Though the universe might in theory have a longer history, the [[International Astronomical Union]]&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; presently use "age of the universe" to mean the duration of the Lambda-CDM expansion, or equivalently the elapsed time since the Big Bang in the current [[observable universe]].

==Observational limits==
Since the universe must be at least as old as the oldest things in it, there are a number of observations which put a lower limit on the age of the universe; these include the temperature of the coolest [[white dwarf]]s, which gradually cool as they age, and the dimmest [[turnoff point]] of [[main sequence]] [[stars]] in clusters (lower-mass stars spend a greater amount of time on the main sequence, so the lowest-mass stars that have evolved off of the main sequence set a minimum age).

==Cosmological parameters==
[[Image:Mplwp universe scale evolution.svg|thumb|400px|The age of the universe can be determined by measuring the [[Hubble constant]] today and extrapolating back in time with the observed value of density parameters (Ω). Before the discovery of [[dark energy]], it was believed that the universe was matter-dominated ([[Einstein–de Sitter universe]], green curve). Note that the [[de Sitter universe]] has infinite age, while the [[Big Crunch|closed]] universe has the least age.]]
[[File:Age Universe Planck 2013.png|thumb|400px|The value of the age correction factor, ''F'', is shown as a function of two [[cosmology|cosmological parameters]]: the current fractional matter density Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and cosmological constant density Ω&lt;sub&gt;''Λ''&lt;/sub&gt;.  The [[Lambda-CDM model|best-fit values]] of these parameters are shown by the box in the upper left; the matter-dominated universe is shown by the star in the lower right.]]
The problem of determining the age of the universe is closely tied to the problem of determining the values of the cosmological parameters. Today this is largely carried out in the context of the [[Lambda CDM model|ΛCDM]] model, where the universe is assumed to contain normal (baryonic) matter, cold [[dark matter]], radiation (including both [[photon]]s and [[neutrino]]s), and a [[cosmological constant]].  The fractional contribution of each to the current energy density of the universe is given by the [[density parameter]]s Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, Ω&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;, and Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt;.  The full ΛCDM model is described by a number of other parameters, but for the purpose of computing its age these three, along with the [[Hubble constant|Hubble parameter]] &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;, are the most important.

If one has accurate measurements of these parameters, then the age of the universe can be determined by using the [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann equation]].  This equation relates the rate of change in the [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] ''a''(''t'') to the matter content of the universe.  Turning this relation around, we can calculate the change in time per change in scale factor and thus calculate the total age of the universe by [[Integral|integrating]] this formula. The age ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is then given by an expression of the form
:&lt;math&gt;t_0 = \frac{1}{H_0} F(\Omega_r,\Omega_m,\Omega_\Lambda,\dots) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hubble's law|Hubble parameter]] and the function ''F'' depends only on the fractional contribution to the universe's energy content that comes from various components. The first observation that one can make from this formula is that it is the Hubble parameter that controls that age of the universe, with a correction arising from the matter and energy content. So a rough estimate of the age of the universe comes from the [[Hubble time]], the inverse of the Hubble parameter. With a value for &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; around {{val|68|u=km/s/Mpc}}, the Hubble time evaluates to &lt;math&gt;1/H_0&lt;/math&gt; = {{val|14.4}} billion years.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To get a more accurate number, the correction factor ''F'' must be computed. In general this must be done numerically, and the results for a range of cosmological parameter values are shown in the figure. For the [[Lambda CDM model|Planck values]] (Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, Ω&lt;sub&gt;''Λ''&lt;/sub&gt;) = (0.3086, 0.6914), shown by the box in the upper left corner of the figure, this correction factor is about ''F'' = 0.956. For a flat universe without any cosmological constant, shown by the star in the lower right corner, ''F'' = {{Frac|2|3}} is much smaller and thus the universe is younger for a fixed value of the Hubble parameter. To make this figure, Ω&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is held constant (roughly equivalent to holding the [[Cosmic Microwave Background|CMB]] temperature constant) and the curvature density parameter is fixed by the value of the other three.

Apart from the Planck satellite, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ([[WMAP]]) was instrumental in establishing an accurate age of the universe, though other measurements must be folded in to gain an accurate number.  [[CMB]] measurements are very good at constraining the matter content Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not as sensitive to Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; directly,&lt;ref name="anim3"/&gt; partly because the cosmological constant becomes important only at low redshift.  The most accurate determinations of the Hubble parameter ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; come from [[Type Ia supernova]]e.  Combining these measurements leads to the generally accepted value for the age of the universe quoted above.

The cosmological constant makes the universe "older" for fixed values of the other parameters. This is significant, since before the cosmological constant became generally accepted, the Big Bang model had difficulty explaining why [[globular cluster]]s in the Milky Way appeared to be far older than the age of the universe as calculated from the Hubble parameter and a matter-only universe.&lt;ref&gt;

==WMAP==
[[NASA]]'s [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) project's [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe#Nine-year data release|nine-year data release]] in 2012 estimated the age of the universe to be {{val|13.772|0.059|e=9}} years (13.772 billion years, with an uncertainty of plus or minus 59 million years).&lt;ref name="arxiv-20121220" /&gt;

However, this age is based on the assumption that the project's underlying model is correct; other methods of estimating the age of the universe could give different ages. Assuming an extra background of relativistic particles, for example, can enlarge the error bars of the WMAP constraint by one order of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;

This measurement is made by using the location of the first acoustic peak in the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background]] power spectrum to determine the size of the decoupling surface (size of the universe at the time of recombination).  The light travel time to this surface (depending on the geometry used) yields a reliable age for the universe.  Assuming the validity of the models used to determine this age, the residual accuracy yields a margin of error near one percent.&lt;ref name="wmap"&gt;

==Planck==
In 2015, the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck Collaboration]]  estimated the age of the universe to be {{val|13.813|0.038}} billion years, slightly higher but within the uncertainties of the earlier number derived from the WMAP data. By combining the Planck data with external data, the best combined estimate of the age of the universe is {{val|13.799|0.021|e=9|u=years}} old.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA on Planck 2015"/&gt;

==Assumption of strong priors==
Calculating the age of the universe is accurate only if the assumptions built into the models being used to estimate it are also accurate. This is referred to as [[strong priors]] and essentially involves stripping the potential errors in other parts of the model to render the accuracy of actual observational data directly into the concluded result.  Although this is not a valid procedure in all contexts (as noted in the accompanying caveat: "based on the fact we have assumed the underlying model we used is correct"{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;!--no reason to doubt this, but quotation should be cited--&gt;), the age given is thus accurate to the specified error (since this error represents the error in the instrument used to gather the raw data input into the model).

The age of the universe based on the best fit to [[Planck (spacecraft)#2015 data release|Planck 2015 data]] alone is {{val|13.813|0.038}} billion years (the estimate of {{val|13.799|0.021}} billion years uses Gaussian [[Prior probability|prior]]s based on earlier estimates from other studies to determine the combined uncertainty). This number represents an accurate "direct" measurement of the age of the universe (other methods typically involve [[Hubble's law]] and the age of the oldest stars in globular clusters, etc.). It is possible to use different methods for determining the same parameter (in this case – the age of the universe) and arrive at different answers with no overlap in the "errors". To best avoid the problem, it is common to show two sets of uncertainties; one related to the actual measurement and the other related to the systematic errors of the model being used.

An important component to the analysis of data used to determine the age of the universe (e.g. from [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]]) therefore is to use a [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian statistical]] analysis, which normalizes the results based upon the priors (i.e. the model).&lt;ref name="wmap" /&gt; This quantifies any uncertainty in the accuracy of a measurement due to a particular model used.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
{{Nature timeline}}

{{main|Cosmic age problem|Cosmic microwave background}}
In the 18th century, the concept that the [[age of the Earth]] was millions, if not billions, of years began to appear. However, most scientists throughout the 19th century and into the first decades of the 20th century presumed that the universe itself was [[Steady State theory|Steady State]] and eternal, with maybe stars coming and going but no changes occurring at the largest scale known at the time.

The first scientific theories indicating that the age of the universe might be finite were the studies of [[thermodynamics]], formalized in the mid-19th century. The concept of [[entropy]] dictates that if the universe (or any other closed system) were infinitely old, then everything inside would be at the same temperature, and thus there would be no stars and no life. No scientific explanation for this contradiction was put forth at the time.

In 1915 [[Albert Einstein]] published the theory of [[general relativity]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |last=Einstein |first=A.
 |date=1915
 |title=Zur allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie

 |pages=778–786
 |language=German
 |bibcode=1915SPAW.......778E
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1917 constructed the first [[cosmological model]] based on his theory. In order to remain consistent with a steady state universe, Einstein added what was later called a [[cosmological constant]] to his equations. However, already in 1922, also using  Einstein's theory, [[Alexander Friedmann]], and independently five years later [[Georges Lemaître]], showed that the universe cannot be static and must be either expanding or contracting. Einstein's model of a static universe was in addition proved unstable by [[Arthur Eddington]].

The first direct observational hint that the universe has a finite age came from the observations of '[[recession velocity|recession velocities]]', mostly by [[Vesto Slipher]], combined with distances to the '[[nebula]]e' ([[galaxy|galaxies]]) by [[Edwin Hubble]] in a  work published in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the 20th century, Hubble and others resolved individual stars within certain nebulae, thus determining that they were galaxies, similar to, but external to, our [[Milky Way Galaxy]]. In addition, these galaxies were very large and very far away. [[electromagnetic spectrum|Spectra]] taken of these distant galaxies showed a [[red shift]] in their [[spectral lines]] presumably caused by the [[Doppler effect]], thus indicating that these galaxies were moving away from the Earth. In addition, the farther away these galaxies seemed to be (the dimmer they appeared to us) the greater was their redshift, and thus the faster they seemed to be moving away. This was the first direct evidence that the universe is not static but expanding. The first estimate of the age of the universe came from the calculation of when all of the objects must have started speeding out from the same point. Hubble's initial value for the universe's age was very low, as the galaxies were assumed to be much closer than later observations found them to be.

The first reasonably accurate measurement of the rate of expansion of the universe, a numerical value now known as the [[Hubble constant]], was made in 1958 by astronomer [[Allan Sandage]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

 |doi=10.1086/146483
}}&lt;/ref&gt; His measured value for the Hubble constant came very close to the value range generally accepted today.

However Sandage, like Einstein, did not believe his own results at the time of discovery. His value for the age of the universe{{Elucidate|date=February 2014|reason=What was his value for the age of the universe?}} was too short to reconcile with the 25-billion-year age estimated at that time for the oldest known [[star]]s. Sandage and other astronomers repeated these measurements numerous times, attempting to reduce the [[Hubble constant]] and thus increase the resulting age for the universe. Sandage even proposed new theories of [[cosmogony]] to explain this discrepancy. This issue was finally resolved by improvements in the theoretical models used for estimating the ages of stars. As of 2013, using the latest models for stellar evolution, the estimated age of the [[oldest star|oldest known star]] is {{val|14.46|0.8}} billion years.&lt;ref name=arxiv&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; finally brought an effective end to the remaining scientific uncertainty over the expanding universe. It was a chance result from work by two teams less than 60 miles apart.  In 1964, [[Arno Allan Penzias|Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] were trying to detect [[radio wave]] [[echo]]es with a supersensitive antenna. The antenna persistently detected a low, steady, mysterious [[noise (electronics)|noise]] in the [[microwave radiation|microwave region]] that was evenly spread over the sky, and was present day and night. After testing, they became certain that the signal did not come from the [[Earth]], the [[Sun]], or [[Milky Way|our galaxy]], but from outside our own galaxy, but could not explain it. At the same time another team, [[Robert H. Dicke]], [[P. J. E. Peebles|Jim Peebles]], and [[David Todd Wilkinson|David Wilkinson]], were attempting to detect low level noise which might be left over from the [[Big Bang]] and could prove whether the Big Bang theory was correct. The two teams realized that the detected noise was in fact radiation left over from the Big Bang, and that this was strong evidence that the theory was correct. Since then, a great deal of other evidence has strengthened and confirmed this conclusion, and refined the estimated age of the universe to its current figure.

The space probes WMAP, launched in 2001, and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]], launched in 2009, produced data that determines the Hubble constant and the age of the universe independent of galaxy distances, removing the largest source of error.&lt;ref name="wmap"/&gt;

The '''balance of nature''' is a theory that proposes that ecological systems are usually in a stable equilibrium or [[homeostasis]], which is to say that a small change in some particular parameter (the size of a particular population, for example) will be corrected by some [[negative feedback]] that will bring the parameter back to its original "point of balance" with the rest of the system.  It may apply where populations depend on each other, for example in predator/prey systems, or relationships between herbivores and their food source.  It is also sometimes applied to the relationship between the Earth's ecosystem, the composition of the atmosphere, and the world's weather.

The [[Gaia hypothesis]] is a balance of nature-based theory that suggests that the Earth and its ecology may act as co-ordinated systems in order to maintain the balance of nature.

The theory that nature is permanently in balance has been largely discredited by scientists working in [[ecology]], as it has been found that chaotic changes in population levels are common, but nevertheless the idea continues to be popular in the general public.&lt;ref name="Zim"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://pus.sagepub.com/content/16/4/393.abstract| title=Ambiguous, circular and polysemous: students' definitions of the "balance of nature" metaphor| journal=Public Understanding of Science| date=October 2007| first=Corinne| last= Zimmerman| volume= 16| number= 4| pages=393–406| doi= 10.1177/0963662505063022| accessdate=19 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kricher2009&gt;{{cite book| author=Kricher, John | year=2009 | title=The Balance of Nature: Ecology's Enduring Myth | publisher=Princeton University Press | isbn=978-0691138985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the later half of the twentieth century the theory was superseded by [[catastrophe theory]] and [[chaos theory]].

==History of the theory==
The concept that nature maintains its condition is of ancient provenance; [[Herodotus]] commented on the wonderful relationship between predator and prey species, which remained in a steady proportion to one another, with predators never excessively consuming their prey populations.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "balance of nature" concept once ruled ecological research, as well as once governing the management of natural resources. This led to a [[doctrine]] popular among some [[conservation movement|conservationist]]s that nature was best left to its own devices, and that [[human]] intervention into it was by definition unacceptable.&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/31/science/new-eye-on-nature-the-real-constant-is-eternal-turmoil.html| title=New Eye on Nature: The Real Constant Is Eternal Turmoil| newspaper=The New York Times| first=William K. |last=Stevens| date=31 July 1990| accessdate=19 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The validity of a "balance of nature" was already questioned in the early 1900s, but the general abandonment of the theory by scientists working in [[ecology]] only happened in the last quarter of that century when studies showed that it did not match what could be observed among plant and animal populations.&lt;ref name=Kricher2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Heneghan, Liam | url=https://aeon.co/essays/nature-is-out-of-balance-but-it-s-still-worth-saving |title=Out of kilter | publisher=aeon | date=9 October 2012  | accessdate=16 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predator prey interactions==
Predator-prey populations tend to show [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] behavior within limits, where the sizes of populations change in a way that may appear random, but is in fact obeying [[Determinism|deterministic]] laws based only on the relationship between a population and its food source illustrated by the [[Lotka–Volterra equation]].  An experimental example of this was shown in an eight-year study on small [[Baltic Sea]] creatures such as [[plankton]], which were isolated from the rest of the ocean. Each member of the [[food web]] was shown to take turns multiplying and declining, even though the scientists kept the outside conditions constant. An article in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' stated; "Advanced mathematical techniques proved the indisputable presence of chaos in this food web ... short-term prediction is possible, but long-term prediction is not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human intervention==
Although some conservationist organizations argue that human activity is incompatible with a balanced ecosystem, there are numerous examples in history showing that several modern day habitats originate from human activity: some of Latin America's rain forests owe their existence to humans planting and transplanting them, while the abundance of grazing animals in the [[Serengeti]] plain of Africa is thought by some ecologists to be partly due to human-set fires that created [[savanna]] habitats.&lt;ref name="NY" /&gt;

Possibly one of the best examples of an ecosystem fundamentally modified by human activity can be observed as a consequence of the Australian [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] practice of "[[Fire-stick farming]]". The legacy of this practice over long periods has resulted in forests being converted to grasslands capable of sustaining larger populations of faunal prey, particularly in the northern and western regions of the continent. So thorough has been the effect of these deliberate regular burnings that many plant and tree species from affected regions have now completely adapted to the annual fire regime in that they require the passage of a fire before their seeds will even germinate. One school in Los Angeles states, " “We have let our kids go to the forest area of the playground. However, five years later, we found that none of the flowers were growing, the natural damp soil had been hardened, and all of the beautiful grass had been plucked,”.

==Continued popularity of the theory==
Despite being discredited among ecologists, the theory is widely held to be true by the general public, with one authority calling it an "enduring myth".&lt;ref name=Kricher2009/&gt; At least in [[Midwestern America]], the "balance of nature" idea was shown to be widely held by both science majors and the general student population.&lt;ref name="Zim" /&gt; In a study at the [[University of Patras]], educational sciences students were asked to reason about the future of ecosystems which suffered human-driven disturbances. Subjects agreed that it was very likely for the ecosystems to fully recover their initial state, referring to either a 'recovery process' which restores the initial 'balance', or specific 'recovery mechanisms' as an ecosystem's inherent characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ergazaki|first=Marida|last2=Ampatzidis|first2=Georgios|date=2012-06-01|title=Students’ Reasoning about the Future of Disturbed or Protected Ecosystems &amp;amp; the Idea of the ‘Balance of Nature’|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11165-011-9208-7|journal=Research in Science Education|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=511–530|doi=10.1007/s11165-011-9208-7|issn=0157-244X|bibcode=2012RScEd..42..511E}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 study, Ampatzidis and Ergazaki discuss the learning objectives and design criteria that a learning environment for non-biology major students should meet to support them challenge the "balance of nature" idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ampatzidis|first=Georgios|last2=Ergazaki|first2=Marida|date=2017-10-01|title=Toward an “Anti-Balance of Nature” Learning Environment for Non-Biology Major Students: Learning Objectives and Design Criteria|url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/nse/abstracts/46/1/170016|journal=Natural Sciences Education|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|doi=10.4195/nse2017.07.0016|issn=1059-9053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[history of science]], the '''clockwork universe''' compares the universe to a [[clockwork|mechanical clock]]. It continues ticking along, as a perfect machine, with its gears governed by the [[laws of physics]], making every aspect of the machine predictable.

== History ==

This idea was very popular among [[Deism|deists]]{{ref}} during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], when [[Isaac Newton]] derived his [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]], and showed that alongside the law of universal [[gravitation]], they could explain the behaviour of both [[motion (physics)|terrestrial objects]] and the [[solar system]].

A similar concept goes back, to [[Johannes de Sacrobosco|John of Sacrobosco's]] early 13th-century introduction to astronomy: ''[[De sphaera mundi|On the Sphere of the World]]''. In this widely popular medieval text, Sacrobosco spoke of the universe as the ''machina mundi'', the machine of the world, suggesting that the reported eclipse of the Sun at the crucifixion of Jesus was a disturbance of the order of that machine.&lt;ref&gt;John of Sacrbosco, ''On the Sphere'', quoted in Edward Grant, ''A Source Book in Medieval Science,'' (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Pr., 1974), p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to [[Gottfried Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Richard Danielson, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5YOEaO_KO_cC&amp;pg=PA246 The Book of the Cosmos: Imagining the Universe from Heraclitus to Hawking]'', [[Basic Books]], 2001 (p. 246)&lt;/ref&gt; a prominent supporter of the theory, in the [[Leibniz–Clarke correspondence]], [[Samuel Clarke]] wrote:

:"The Notion of the World's being a great Machine, going on without the Interposition of God, as a Clock continues to go without the Assistance of a Clockmaker; is the Notion of Materialism and Fate, and tends, (under pretence of making God a Supra-mundane Intelligence,) to exclude Providence and God's Government in reality out of the World."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Edward B. 1991. "Newton's rejection of the "Newtonian world view" : the role of divine will in Newton's natural philosophy." Science and Christian Belief 3, no. 2: 103-117. Clarke quotation taken from article.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 artist [[Tim Wetherell]] created a large wall piece for [[Questacon]] (The National Science and Technology centre in Canberra, Australia) representing the concept of the clockwork universe. This steel artwork contains moving gears, a working clock, and a movie of the [[lunar terminator]].

The '''cosmic age problem''' is a historical problem in astronomy concerning the [[age of the universe]]. The problem was that at various times in the 20th century, some objects in the universe were estimated to be older than the time elapsed since the [[Big Bang]],&lt;ref name=Evidence&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/astronomy/bigbang.html#oldstars Evidence for the Big Bang] by Björn Feuerbacher and Ryan Scranton. January 25, 2006. Retrieved 16 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; as estimated from measurements of the expansion rate of the universe known as the [[Hubble constant]], denoted H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. (This is more correctly called the Hubble parameter, since it generally varies with time).
If so, this would represent a contradiction, since objects such as galaxies, stars and planets could not have existed in the extreme temperatures and densities shortly after the Big Bang.

Since around 1997–2003, the problem is believed to be solved by most cosmologists: modern cosmological measurements lead to a precise estimate of the [[age of the universe]] (i.e. time since the Big Bang) of 13.8 billion years, and recent age estimates for the oldest objects are either younger than this, or consistent allowing for measurement uncertainties.

== Early years ==

Following theoretical developments of the [[Friedmann equations]] by [[Alexander Friedmann]] and [[Georges Lemaître]] in the 1920s, and the discovery of the expanding universe by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929, it was immediately clear that tracing this expansion backwards in time predicts that the universe had almost zero size at a finite time in the past. This concept, initially known as the "Primeval Atom" by Lemaitre, was later elaborated into the modern [[Big Bang]] theory. If the universe had expanded at a constant rate in the past, the age of the universe now (i.e. the time since the Big Bang) is simply the inverse of the Hubble constant, often known as the ''Hubble time''. For Big Bang models with zero [[cosmological constant]] and positive matter density, the actual age must be somewhat younger than this Hubble time; typically the age would be between 66% and 90% of the Hubble time, depending on the density of matter.

Hubble's early estimate of his constant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hubble|first1=E.|title=A relation between distance and radial velocity among extra-galactic nebulae|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=15 March 1929|volume=15|issue=3|pages=168–173|doi=10.1073/pnas.15.3.168|pmid=16577160|pmc=522427|bibcode = 1929PNAS...15..168H }}&lt;/ref&gt; was 550&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc, and the inverse of that is 1.8 billion years. It was believed by many geologists such as [[Arthur Holmes]] in the 1920s that the Earth was probably over 2 billion years old, but with large uncertainty.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The possible discrepancy between the ages of the Earth and the universe was probably one motivation for the development of the [[Steady State theory]] in 1948 as an alternative to the Big Bang;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kragh|first1=Helge|title=Cosmology and Controversy|date=1999|publisher=Princeton Univ. Press|isbn=978-0691005461}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the (now obsolete) steady state theory, the universe is infinitely old and on average unchanging with time. The steady state theory postulated spontaneous creation of matter to keep the average density constant as the universe expands, and therefore most galaxies still have an age less than 1/H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. However, if H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; had been 550&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc, our Milky Way galaxy would be exceptionally large compared to most other galaxies, so it could well be much older than an average galaxy, therefore eliminating the age problem.

== 1950–1970 ==

In the 1950s, two substantial errors were discovered in Hubble's extragalactic distance scale: first in 1952, [[Walter Baade]] discovered there were two classes of [[Cepheid]] variable star. Hubble's sample comprised different classes nearby and in other galaxies, and correcting this error made all other galaxies twice as distant as Hubble's values, thus doubling the Hubble time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baade|first1=W.|title=The Period-Luminosity Relation of the Cepheids|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|date=February 1956|volume=68|issue=400|pages=5|doi=10.1086/126870|bibcode = 1956PASP...68....5B }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second error was discovered by [[Allan Sandage]] and coworkers: for galaxies beyond the [[Local Group]], Cepheids were too faint to observe with Hubble's instruments, so Hubble used the brightest stars as distance indicators. Many of Hubble's "brightest stars" were actually HII regions or clusters containing many stars, which caused another underestimation of distances for these more distant galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Humason |first1=M. L. |last2=Mayall |first2=N. U. |last3=Sandage |first3=A. R. |title=Redshifts and magnitudes of extragalactic nebulae |journal=The Astronomical Journal |date=April 1956 |volume=61 |page=97 |doi=10.1086/107297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in 1958 Sandage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sandage|first=Allan|title=Current Problems in the Extragalactic Distance Scale|journal=Astrophysical Journal|date=1958|volume=127|page=513|doi=10.1086/146483|bibcode=1958ApJ...127..513S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  published the first reasonably accurate measurement of the Hubble constant, at 75&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc, which is close to modern estimates of 68–74&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riess|first=A.|title=A 3% solution: determination of the Hubble constant with the Hubble Space Telescope|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=730|issue=119|pages=119|arxiv=1103.2976|last2=Macri|first2=Lucas|last3=Casertano|first3=Stefano|last4=Lampeitl|first4=Hubert|last5= Ferguson|first5=Henry C.|last6= Filippenko|first6=Alexei V.|last7= Jha|first7=Saurabh W.|last8=Li|first8=Weidong|last9=Chornock|first9=Ryan|year=2011|bibcode = 2011ApJ...730..119R |doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/730/2/119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The age of the Earth (actually the Solar System) was first accurately measured around 1955 by [[Clair Patterson]] at 4.55 billion years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patterson|first1=C.|last2=Tilton|first2=G.|last3=Inghram|first3=M.|title=Age of the Earth|journal=Science|date=21 January 1955|volume=121|issue=3134|pages=69–75|doi=10.1126/science.121.3134.69|pmid=17782556|bibcode = 1955Sci...121...69P }}&lt;/ref&gt; essentially identical to the modern value. For H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 75&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc, the inverse of H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is 13.0 billion years; so after 1958 the Big Bang model age was comfortably older than the Earth.

However, in the 1960s and onwards, new developments in the theory of stellar evolution enabled age estimates for large star clusters called [[globular clusters]]: these generally gave age estimates of around 15 billion years, with substantial scatter.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  Further revisions of the Hubble constant by Sandage and [[Gustav Tammann]] in the 1970s gave values around 50–60&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandage|first1=A.|last2=Tammann|first2=G. A.|title=Steps toward the Hubble constant. VII - Distances to NGC 2403, M101, and the Virgo cluster using 21 centimeter line widths compared with optical methods: The global value of H sub 0|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=210|pages=7|doi=10.1086/154798|bibcode=1976ApJ...210....7S|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an inverse of 16-20 billion years, consistent with globular cluster ages.

== 1975–1990 ==

However, in the late 1970s to early 1990s, the age problem re-appeared: new estimates of the Hubble constant gave higher values, with [[Gerard de Vaucouleurs]] estimating values 90–100&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Vaucouleurs|first1=G.|title=Five crucial tests of the cosmic distance scale using the Galaxy as fundamental standard|journal=Nature|date=23 September 1982|volume=299|issue=5881|pages=303–307|doi=10.1038/299303a0|bibcode = 1982Natur.299..303D }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Marc Aaronson]] and co-workers gave values around 80-90 &amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaronson|first1=M.|last2=Bothun|first2=G.|last3=Mould|first3=J.|last4=Huchra|first4=J.|last5=Schommer|first5=R.

== Late 1990s: probable solution ==

The age problem was eventually thought to be resolved by several developments between 1995-2003: firstly, a large program with the [[Hubble space telescope]] measured the Hubble constant at 72&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc with 10 percent uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Madore|first1=Barry F.|last2=Freedman|first2=Wendy  L.|last3=Silbermann|first3=N.|last4=Harding|first4=Paul|last5=Huchra|first5=John|last6=Mould|first6=Jeremy R.|last7=Graham|first7=John A.|last8=Ferrarese|first8=Laura|last9=Gibson|first9=Brad K.|last10=Han|first10=Mingsheng|last11=Hoessel|first11=John G.|last12=Hughes|first12=Shaun M.|last13=Illingworth|first13=Garth D.|last14=Phelps|first14=Randy|last15=Sakai|first15=Shoko|last16=Stetson|first16=Peter|title=The Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale.

The presence of dark energy implies that the universe was expanding more slowly at around half its present age than today, which makes the universe older for a given value of the Hubble constant.  The combination of the three results above essentially removed the discrepancy between estimated globular cluster ages and the age of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Krauss, Lawrence M. |author2=Chaboyer, Brian |title=Age Estimates of Globular Clusters in the Milky Way: Constraints on Cosmology |journal=Science |date=3 January 2003 |volume=299 |issue=5603 |pages=65&amp;ndash;69 |bibcode=2003Sci...299...65K |doi=10.1126/science.1075631 |pmid=12511641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cosmic time''' (also known as '''time since the big bang''') is the [[time]] [[coordinate]] commonly used in the [[Big Bang]] models of [[physical cosmology]].  It is defined for [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]], [[Cosmic expansion|expanding]] universes as follows:  Choose a time coordinate so that the universe has the same [[density]] everywhere at each moment in time (the fact that this is possible means that the universe is, by definition, homogeneous).  Measure the passage of time using [[Clock|clocks]] moving with the [[Hubble flow]].  Choose the big bang singularity as the origin of the time coordinate. 

Cosmic time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Cosmology|last=Dodelson|first=Scott|publisher=Academic Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-12-219141-1|location=|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Cosmology|last=Bonometto|first=Silvio|publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing|year=2002|isbn=0750308109|location=Bristol and Philadelphia|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a measure of time by a physical clock with zero [[Peculiar velocity#Cosmology|peculiar velocity]] in the absence of matter over-/under-densities (to prevent time dilation due to relativistic effects or confusions caused by expansion of the universe). Unlike other measures of time such as temperature, redshift, particle horizon, or Hubble horizon, the cosmic time (similar and complementary to the comoving coordinates) is blind to the expansion of the universe. 

There are two main ways for establishing a reference point for the cosmic time. The most trivial way is to take the present time as the cosmic reference point (sometimes referred to as the lookback time) or alternatively, take the [[Big Bang]] as &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; (also referred to as age of the universe). The big bang doesn't necessarily have to correspond to a physical event but rather it refers to the point at which the scale factor would vanish for a standard cosmological model such as ΛCDM. For instance, in the case of inflation, i.e. a non-standard cosmology, the hypothetical moment of big bang is still determined using the benchmark cosmological models which may coincide with the end of the inflationary epoch. For inflationary models, it is not possible to establish a well defined origin of time before the big bang since the universe does not require a beginning event in such models. For technical purposes, concepts such as the average temperature of the universe (in units of eV) or the particle horizon are used when the early universe is the objective of a study since understanding the interaction among particles is more relevant than their time coordinate or age. 

Cosmic time is the standard time coordinate for specifying the [[Friedmann&amp;ndash;Lemaître&amp;ndash;Robertson&amp;ndash;Walker metric|Friedmann&amp;ndash;Lemaître&amp;ndash;Robertson&amp;ndash;Walker solutions]] of [[Einstein's equations]].

'''Cosmography''' is the science that [[map]]s the general features of the [[cosmos]] or [[universe]], describing both [[heaven]] and [[Earth]] (but without encroaching on [[geography]] or [[astronomy]]). The 14th-century work ''[['Aja'ib al-makhluqat wa-ghara'ib al-mawjudat]]'' by [[Persian people|Persian]] physician [[Zakariya al-Qazwini]] is considered to be an early work of cosmography.

Traditional Hindu, Buddhist and [[Jainism|Jain]] cosmography schematize a universe centered on [[Mount Meru]] surrounded by rivers, continents and seas.  These cosmographies posit a universe being repeatedly created and destroyed over time cycles of immense lengths.

an Engraving on Wood, attributed to---&gt; &amp;ndash; by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], in the "Cosmographie" of Munster (Basle, 1552, folio).]]
In 1551, [[Martín Cortés de Albacar]], from [[Zaragoza]], Spain, published ''[[Breve compendio de la esfera y del arte de navegar]]''. Translated into English and reprinted several times, the work was of great influence in Britain for many years. He proposed spherical charts and mentioned magnetic deviation and the existence of magnetic poles.

[[Peter Heylin]]'s 1652 book ''Cosmographie'' (enlarged from his ''Microcosmos'' of 1621) was one of the earliest attempts to describe the entire world in English, and being the first known description of [[Australia]] and among the first of [[California]]. The book has 4 sections, examining the geography, politics, and cultures of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, with an addendum on ''[[Terra incognita|Terra Incognita]]'', including Australia, and extending to [[Utopia]], [[Álfheimr|Fairyland]], and the "Land of [[Chivalry|Chivalrie]]".

In 1659, Thomas Porter published a smaller, but extensive ''Compendious Description of the Whole World'', which also included a [[chronology]] of world events from [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] forward. These were all part of a major trend in the [[European Renaissance]] to explore (and perhaps comprehend) the known world.

The word was also commonly used by [[Buckminster Fuller]] in his lectures.

In [[astrophysics]], the term "cosmography" is beginning to be used to describe attempts to determine the large-scale [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|matter distribution]] and [[kinematics]] of the [[universe|observable universe]], dependent on the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] but independent of the temporal dependence of the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] on the matter/energy composition of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Cosmological horizons set the size and scale of the [[observable universe]]. This article explains a number of these horizons.

==Particle horizon==
{{main|Particle horizon}}
The '''particle horizon''' (also called the cosmological horizon, the comoving horizon, or the cosmic light horizon) is the maximum distance from which particles could have traveled to the observer in the age of the universe. It represents the boundary between the observable and the unobservable regions of the universe, so its distance at the present epoch defines the size of the observable universe. Due to the expansion of the universe it is not simply the age of the universe times the speed of light, as in the Hubble horizon, but rather the speed of light multiplied by the conformal time. The existence, properties, and significance of a cosmological horizon depend on the particular cosmological model.

In terms of comoving distance, the particle horizon is equal to the '''conformal time''' that has passed since the Big Bang, times the speed of light. In general, the conformal time at a certain time is given in terms of the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; by,

:&lt;math&gt;\eta(t) = \int_{0}^{t} \frac{dt'}{a(t')}&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\eta(a) = \int_{0}^{a} \frac{1}{a' H(a')} \frac{da'}{a'}&lt;/math&gt;.

The particle horizon is the boundary between two regions at a point at a given time: one region defined by events that have already been observed by an observer, and the other by events which cannot be observed ''at that time''. It represents the furthest distance from which we can retrieve information from the past, and so defines the observable universe.&lt;ref name="Berta" /&gt;

==Hubble horizon==

{{Main article|Hubble volume}}Hubble radius, Hubble sphere, Hubble volume, or Hubble horizon is a conceptual horizon defining the boundary between particles that are moving slower and faster than the speed of light relative to an observer at one given time. Note that this does not mean the particle is unobservable, the light from the past is reaching and will continue to reach the observer for a while. Also, more importantly, in the current expansion model e.g., light emitted from the Hubble radius will reach us in a finite amount of time. It is a common misconception that light from the Hubble radius can never reach us. It is true that particles on the Hubble radius recede from us with the speed of light, but the Hubble radius gets larger over time (because the Hubble parameter H gets smaller over time), so light emitted towards us from a particle on the Hubble radius will be inside the Hubble radius some time later. Only light emitted from the cosmic event horizon or further will never reach us in a finite amount of time.

The Hubble velocity of an object is given by Hubble's law,

:&lt;math&gt;v=x H&lt;/math&gt;.

Replacing &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; with speed of light &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and solving for proper distance &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; we obtain the radius of Hubble sphere as

:&lt;math&gt;r_{HS}(t)=\frac{c}{H(t)}&lt;/math&gt;.

In an ever-accelerating universe, if two particles are separated by a distance greater than the Hubble radius, they cannot talk to each other from now on (as they are now, not as they have been in the past), However, if they are outside of each other's particle horizon, they could have never communicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modern Cosmology|last = Dodelson|first = Scott|publisher = [[Academic Press]]|year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = 146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the form of expansion of the universe, they may be able to exchange information in the future. Today,

:&lt;math&gt;r_{HS}(t_0) = \frac{c}{H_0}&lt;/math&gt;,

yielding a Hubble horizon of some 4.1 Gpc. This horizon is not really a physical size, but it is often used as useful length scale as most physical sizes in cosmology can be written in terms of those factors.

One can also define comoving Hubble horizon by simply dividing Hubble radius by the scale factor

:&lt;math&gt;r_{HS, comoving}(t)=\frac{c}{a(t) H(t)}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Event horizon==
{{main|Event horizon}}
The particle horizon differs from the cosmic [[event horizon]], in that the particle horizon represents the largest [[comoving distance]] from which light could have reached the observer by a specific time, while the event horizon is the largest comoving distance from which light emitted now can ''ever'' reach the observer in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Lars Bergström and Ariel Goobar: "Cosmology and Particle Physics", ''WILEY'' (1999), page 65.{{ISBN|0-471-97041-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current distance to our cosmic event horizon is about 5 Gpc (16 billion light years), well within our observable range given by the particle horizon.&lt;ref name=ly93&gt;{{cite web|last = Lineweaver|first = Charles|author2=Tamara M. Davis|year = 2005|url = http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~charley/papers/LineweaverDavisSciAm.pdf|title = Misconceptions about the Big Bang|publisher = [[Scientific American]]|accessdate = 2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the proper distance to the event horizon at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is given by&lt;ref name="Giovannini"&gt;{{cite book|author=Massimo Giovannini|title=A primer on the physics of the cosmic microwave background|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ziIOYR1qZQC&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=1 May 2011|year=2008|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|isbn=978-981-279-142-9|pages=70–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;d_e(t) = a(t) \int_{t}^{t_{max}} \frac{cdt'}{a(t')}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;t_{max}&lt;/math&gt; is the time-coordinate of the end of the universe, which would be infinite in the case of a universe that expands forever.

For our case, assuming that [[dark energy]] is due to a [[cosmological constant]], &lt;math&gt;d_e(t_0) &lt; \infin&lt;/math&gt;.

==Future horizon==
In an [[accelerating universe]], there are events which will be unobservable as &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow \infin&lt;/math&gt; as signals from future events become [[redshift]]ed to arbitrarily long wavelengths in the exponentially expanding [[de Sitter space]]. This sets a limit on the farthest distance that we can possibly see as measured in units of proper distance today. Or, more precisely, there are events that are [[spacelike|spatially separated]] for a certain frame of reference happening [[simultaneity|simultaneously]] with the event occurring right now for which no signal will ever reach us, even though we can observe events that occurred [[timelike|at the same location in space that happened in the distant past]]. While we will continue to receive signals from this location in space, even if we wait an infinite amount of time, a signal that left from that location today will never reach us. Additionally, the signals coming from that location will have less and less energy and be less and less frequent until the location, for all practical purposes, becomes unobservable. In a universe that is dominated by [[dark energy]] which is undergoing an exponential expansion of the [[cosmic scale factor|scale factor]], all objects that are [[Virial theorem#In astrophysics|gravitationally unbound]] with respect to the Milky Way will become unobservable, in a futuristic version of [[Jacobus Kapteyn|Kapteyn's universe]].&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/0704.0221&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical horizons==
While not technically "horizons" in the sense of an impossibility for observations due to relativity or cosmological solutions, there are practical horizons which include the optical horizon, set at the [[surface of last scattering]]. This is the farthest distance that any photon can freely stream. Similarly, there is a "neutrino horizon" set for the [[cosmic neutrino background|farthest distance a neutrino can freely stream]] and a gravitational wave horizon at the farthest distance that [[gravitational wave background|gravitational waves can freely stream]]. The latter is predicted to be a direct probe of the end of [[cosmic inflation]].

The '''cosmos''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|k|ɒ|z|m|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|-|m|oʊ|s}}) is the [[universe]]. Using the word ''cosmos'' rather than the word ''universe'' implies viewing the universe as a complex and orderly [[system]] or entity; the opposite of [[Chaos (cosmogony)| chaos]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The cosmos, and our understanding of the reasons for its existence and significance, are studied in [[cosmology]] - a very broad discipline covering any scientific, religious, or philosophical contemplation of the cosmos and its nature, or reasons for existing. Religious and philosophical approaches may include in their concepts of the cosmos various spiritual entities or other matters deemed to exist outside our physical universe.

== Etymology ==
The [[philosopher]] [[Pythagoras]] first used the term ''cosmos'' ({{lang-grc|κόσμος}}) for the order of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iamblichus]], ''Pyth.'', β 59; [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] ΙΙ 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anaxagoras]] further introduced the concept of a Cosmic Mind (''[[Nous]]'') ordering all things (Aetius Ι 3.5).&lt;/ref&gt; The term became part of modern language in the 19th century when geographer–polymath [[Alexander von Humboldt]] resurrected the use of the word from the ancient Greek, assigned it to his five-volume treatise, ''[[Kosmos (Humboldt)|Kosmos]]'', which influenced modern and somewhat [[holism|holistic]] perception of the universe as one interacting [[entity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MfgpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe|last=Humboldt|first=Alexander von|last2=Paul|first2=Benjamin Horatio|last3=von)|first3=Wilhelm Humboldt (Freiherr|last4=Dallas|first4=William Sweetland|date=1860|publisher=Harper &amp; brothers|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humansandnature.org/introducing-humboldt-s-cosmos-article-26.php|title=Introducing Humboldt's Cosmos {{!}} Center for Humans &amp; Nature|website=Center for Humans &amp; Nature|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cosmology ==
[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|right|The Ancient and [[Medieval]] cosmos as depicted in [[Peter Apian]]'s ''Cosmographia'' (Antwerp, 1539).]]
[[Cosmology]] is the study of the cosmos, and in its broadest sense covers a variety of very different approaches: scientific, religious and philosophical. All cosmologies have in common an attempt to understand the implicit order within the whole of being. In this way, most religions and [[philosophy|philosophical]] systems have a cosmology.

When ''cosmology'' is used without a qualifier, it often signifies physical cosmology, unless the context makes clear that a different meaning is intended.

=== Physical cosmology ===
{{main|Cosmology}}
Physical cosmology (often simply described as 'cosmology') is the scientific study of the universe, from the beginning of its physical existence. It includes speculative concepts such as a multiverse, when these are being discussed. In [[physical cosmology]], the term ''cosmos'' is often used in a technical way, referring to a particular [[spacetime]] continuum within a (postulated) [[multiverse]]. Our particular cosmos, the [[observable universe]], is generally capitalized as ''the Cosmos''. 

In physical cosmology, the uncapitalized term '''cosmic''' signifies a subject with a relationship to the universe, such as 'cosmic time' (time since the [[Big Bang]]), '[[cosmic rays]]' (high energy particles or radiation detected from [[outer space|space]]), and '[[cosmic microwave background]]' (microwave radiation detectable from all directions in space).

According to [[wikisource:Author:Charles Peter Mason|Charles Peter Mason]] in [[William Smith (lexicographer)|Sir William Smith]] ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'' (1870, see book screenshot for full quote), [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] described the universe.&lt;ref name=CPM&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir William Smith|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology|year=1870|url=https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofgree03smituoft#page/304/|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Philolaus-and-Philomelus-Pythagorean-Book.jpg|thumb|upright|Excerpt from [[Philolaus]] Pythagoras book, (Charles Peter Mason, 1870)]]
{{quote|
It appears, in fact, from this, as well as from the extant fragments, that the first book (from [[Philolaus]]) of the work contained a general account of the origin and arrangement of the universe. The second book appears to have been an exposition of the nature of numbers, which in the Pythagorean theory are the essence and source of all things. (p. 305)}}

=== Philosophical cosmology ===
{{main|Philosophical cosmology}}
Cosmology is a branch of [[metaphysics]] that deals with the nature of the universe, a theory or doctrine describing the natural order of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cosmology|title=Definition of "Cosmology"|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic definition of Cosmology is the science of the origin and development of the universe. In modern astronomy the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]] is the dominant postulation.

=== Religious cosmology ===
{{see also|Religious cosmology|Hellenistic philosophy and Christianity|Orphism (religion)}}

In [[theology]], the cosmos is the [[Creation myth|created]] heavenly bodies (sun, moon, planets, and [[fixed stars]]). In [[Christian theology]], the word is also used synonymously with ''[[aeon|aion]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concerning Aion and Aionios|url=http://www.saviourofall.org/Writings/aion.html|publisher=Saviour of All Fellowship|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to "worldly life" or "this world" or "this age" as opposed to the [[afterlife]] or [[world to come]].

The 1870 book ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' noted&lt;ref name=CPM /&gt;
:[[Thales]] dogma that water is the origin of things, that is, that it is that out of which every thing arises, and into which every thing resolves itself, Thales may have followed Orphic cosmogonies, while, unlike them, he sought to establish the truth of the assertion. Hence, Aristotle, immediately after he has called him the originator of philosophy brings forward the reasons which Thales was believed to have adduced in confirmation of that assertion; for that no written development of it, or indeed any book by ''Thales'', was extant, is proved by the expressions which Aristotle uses when he brings forward the doctrines and proofs of the [[Miletus|Milesian]]. (p. 1016)

:[[Plato]], describes the idea of the good, or the Godhead, sometimes ''teleologically'', as the ultimate purpose of all conditioned existence; sometimes ''cosmologically'', as the ultimate operative cause; and has begun to develop the ''cosmological'', as also the physico-theological proof for the being of God; but has referred both back to the idea of the Good, as the necessary presupposition to all other ideas, and our cognition of them. (p. 402)

The book ''The Works of Aristotle'' (1908, p.&amp;nbsp;80 ''Fragments'') mentioned&lt;ref name=Aristotle1908&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/worksofaristotle12arisuoft|title=The Works of Aristotle|year=1908|author=Aristotle|author2=Ross, W. D. (William David), 1877|author3=Smith, J. A. (John Alexander), 1863-1939|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Aristotle says the poet ''Orpheus'' never existed; the Pythagoreans ascribe this Orphic poem to a certain ''Cercon'' (see [[Cercops]]).

[[Bertrand Russell]] (1947) noted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|title=History of Western Philosophy|year=1947|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The Orphics were an ascetic sect; wine, to them, was only a symbol, as, later, in the Christian sacrament. The intoxication that they sought was that of "enthusiasm," of union with the god. They believed themselves, in this way, to acquire mystic knowledge not obtainable by ordinary means. This mystical element entered into Greek philosophy with Pythagoras, who was a reformer of Orphism as Orpheus was a reformer of the religion of Dionysus. From Pythagoras Orphic elements entered into the philosophy of Plato, and from Plato into most later philosophy that was in any degree religious.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22670">[[File:Double Layer.png|thumb|300px|Schematic of double layer in a liquid at contact with a negatively-charged solid. Depending on the nature of the solids, there may be another double layer (unmarked on the drawing) inside the solid.]]

A '''double layer''' ('''DL''', also called an '''electrical double layer''', '''EDL''') is a structure that appears on the surface of an object when it is exposed to a fluid. The object might be a solid particle, a gas bubble, a liquid [[droplet]], or a [[porous media|porous body]]. The DL refers to two parallel layers of charge surrounding the object. The first layer, the [[surface charge]] (either positive or negative), consists of ions [[adsorbed]] onto the object due to chemical interactions.   The second layer is composed of ions attracted to the surface charge via the [[Coulomb force]], electrically [[Electric-field screening|screening]] the first layer. This second layer is loosely associated with the object. It is made of free ions that move in the fluid under the influence of [[Electromagnetism|electric attraction]] and [[thermal motion]] rather than being firmly anchored.  It is thus called the "diffuse layer".

[[Interface (chemistry)|Interfacial]] DLs are most apparent in systems with a large surface area to volume ratio, such as a [[colloid]] or porous bodies with particles or pores (respectively) on the scale of micrometres to nanometres. However, DLs are important to other phenomena, such as the [[electrochemical]] behaviour of [[electrode]]s.

DLs play a fundamental role in many everyday substances. For instance, homogenized milk exists only because fat droplets are covered with a DL that prevents their [[coagulation (milk)|coagulation]] into butter. DLs exist in practically all [[heterogeneous]] fluid-based systems, such as blood, paint, ink and ceramic and cement [[slurry]].

The DL is closely related to [[electrokinetic phenomena]] and [[electroacoustic phenomena]].

== Development of the (interfacial) double layer ==

=== Helmholtz ===
[[File:EDLC-Potentialdistribution.png|thumb|right|200px|Simplified illustration of the potential development in the area and in the further course of a Helmholtz double layer.]]
When an ''electronic'' conductor is brought in contact with a solid or liquid ''ionic'' conductor (electrolyte), a common boundary ([[Interface (chemistry)|interface]]) among the two [[Phase (matter)|phases]] appears. [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=H.|periodical=Annalen der Physik und Chemie|title=Ueber einige Gesetze der Vertheilung elektrischer Ströme in körperlichen Leitern mit Anwendung auf die thierisch-elektrischen Versuche |volume=165|issue=6|year=1853|pages=211–233|language=German|doi=10.1002/andp.18531650603|last1=Helmholtz|bibcode=1853AnP...165..211H}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to realize that [[Electric charge|charged]] electrodes immersed in electrolyte solutions repel the co-ions of the charge while attracting counterions to their surfaces. Two layers of opposite [[Electrical polarity|polarity]] form at the interface between electrode and electrolyte.
In 1853 he showed that an electrical double layer (DL) is essentially a [[molecule|molecular]] dielectric and stores charge electrostatically.&lt;ref name="EDL"&gt;{{cite web | title = The electrical double layer | year = 2011 | url = http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/sciences/Chemistry/Electrochemis/Electrochemical/ElectricalDouble/ElectricalDouble.htm | accessdate = 23 April 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110531014449/http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/Sciences/Chemistry/Electrochemis/Electrochemical/ElectricalDouble/ElectricalDouble.htm | archivedate = 31 May 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Below the electrolyte's decomposition voltage, the stored charge is linearly dependent on the voltage applied.

This early model predicted a constant [[differential capacitance]] independent from the charge density depending on the [[dielectric constant]] of the electrolyte [[solvent]] and the thickness of the double-layer.&lt;ref name="Namisnyk"&gt;{{cite web |author= Adam Marcus Namisnyk |title= A survey of electrochemical supercapacitor technology |url= http://services.eng.uts.edu.au/cempe/subjects_JGZ/eet/Capstone%20thesis_AN.pdf |accessdate= 2012-12-10 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141222044332/http://services.eng.uts.edu.au/cempe/subjects_JGZ/eet/Capstone%20thesis_AN.pdf |archivedate= 2014-12-22 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Srinivasan"&gt;Srinivasan S.

This model, with a good foundation for the description of the interface, does not consider important factors including diffusion/mixing of ions in solution, the possibility of [[adsorption]] onto the surface and the interaction between solvent [[Electric dipole moment|dipole moments]] and the electrode.

=== Gouy-Chapman ===
[[Louis Georges Gouy]] in 1910 and [[David Chapman (scientist)|David Leonard Chapman]] in 1913 both observed that capacitance was not a constant and that it depended on the applied potential and the ionic concentration. The "Gouy-Chapman model" made significant improvements by introducing a [[Diffusion|diffuse]] model of the DL. In this model the charge distribution of ions as a function of distance from the metal surface allows [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]] to be applied. Thus the [[electric potential]] [[Exponential decay|decreases exponentially]] away from the surface of the fluid bulk.&lt;ref name="Namisnyk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Ehrenstein  | first = Gerald  | title = Surface charge  | year = 2001  | url = http://www.biophysics.org/Portals/1/PDFs/Education/ehrenstein.pdf  | accessdate = 30 May 2011  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928073500/http://www.biophysics.org/Portals/1/PDFs/Education/ehrenstein.pdf  | archive-date = 2011-09-28  | dead-url = yes  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stern ===
The Gouy-Chapman model fails for highly charged DLs. In 1924 [[Otto Stern]] suggested combining the Helmholtz model with the Gouy-Chapman model: In Stern's model, some ions adhere to the electrode as suggested by Helmholtz, giving an internal Stern layer, while some form a Gouy-Chapman diffuse layer.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, O. ''Z.Electrochem'', 30, 508 (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stern layer accounts for ions' finite size and consequently an ion's closest approach to the electrode is on the order of the ionic radius. The Stern model has its own limitations, namely that it effectively treats ions as point charges, assumes all significant interactions in the [[diffuse layer]] are [[Coulomb]]ic,  and assumes [[dielectric permittivity]] to be constant throughout the double layer and that fluid viscosity is constant plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = SMIRNOV  | first = Gerald  | title = Electric Double Layer  | year = 2011| url = http://web.nmsu.edu/~snsm/classes/chem435/Lab14/double_layer.html   | accessdate = 23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grahame ===

Outer Helmholtz plane (OHP), 3. Diffuse layer, 4. Solvated ions (cations) 5. Specifically adsorbed ions (redox ion, which contributes to the pseudocapacitance), 6. Molecules of the electrolyte solvent]]
D. C. Grahame modified the Stern model in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Grahame, Chem. Rev., 41 (1947) 441&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that some ionic or uncharged species can penetrate the Stern layer, although the closest approach to the electrode is normally occupied by solvent molecules. This could occur if ions lose their [[solvation shell]] as they approach the electrode. He called ions in direct contact with the electrode "specifically adsorbed ions". This model proposed the existence of three regions. The inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) passes through the centres of the specifically adsorbed ions. The outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) passes through the centres of solvated ions at the distance of their closest approach to the electrode.&lt;ref&gt;M. Nakamura et al., "Outer Helmholtz Plane of the Electrical Double Layer Formed at the Solid Electrode–Liquid Interface" ChemPhysChem, 12 (2011) 1430&lt;/ref&gt; Finally the diffuse layer is the region beyond the OHP.

=== Bockris/Devanathan/Müller (BDM) ===
In 1963 [[John Bockris|J. O'M. Bockris]], M. A. V. Devanathan and [[Klaus Müller (chemist)|Klaus Müller]]&lt;ref&gt;J. O'M. Bockris, M. A. V Devanathan, and K. Mueller, Proc. Roy. Soc, Ser. A. 274, 55 (1963)&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the BDM model of the double-layer that included the action of the solvent in the interface. They suggested that the attached molecules of the solvent, such as water, would have a fixed alignment to the electrode surface. This first layer of solvent molecules displays a strong orientation to the electric field depending on the charge. This orientation has great influence on the [[permittivity]] of the solvent that varies with field strength. The IHP passes through the centers of these molecules. Specifically adsorbed, partially solvated ions appear in this layer. The solvated ions of the electrolyte are outside the IHP. Through the centers of these ions pass the OHP. The diffuse layer is the region beyond the OHP.

=== Trasatti/Buzzanca ===
Further research with double layers on ruthenium dioxide films in 1971 by Sergio Trasatti and Giovanni Buzzanca demonstrated that the electrochemical behavior of these electrodes at low voltages with specific adsorbed ions was like that of capacitors. The specific adsorption of the ions in this region of potential could also involve a partial charge transfer between the ion and the electrode. It was the first step towards understanding pseudocapacitance.&lt;ref name="Srinivasan" /&gt;

=== Conway ===
[[File:Bockris Group At Imperical College, London 1947.png|thumb|left|Ph.D., Brian Evans Conway within the [[John Bockris]] Group At [[Imperial College]], London 1947]]

Between 1975 and 1980 [[Brian Evans Conway]] conducted extensive fundamental and development work on [[ruthenium oxide]] electrochemical capacitors. In 1991 he described the difference between 'Supercapacitor' and 'Battery' behavior in electrochemical energy storage. In 1999 he coined the term supercapacitor to explain the increased capacitance by surface redox reactions with faradaic charge transfer between electrodes and ions.&lt;ref name="Conway Transition"&gt;{{citation|last1=Conway|first1=B.E.|periodical=Journal of the Electrochemical Society|title=Transition from 'Supercapacitor' to 'Battery' Behavior in Electrochemical Energy Storage |volume=138|issue=6|pages=1539–1548|date= May 1991|language=German|doi=10.1149/1.2085829}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.K.

His "supercapacitor" stored electrical charge partially in the Helmholtz double-layer and partially as the result of faradaic reactions with "pseudocapacitance" charge transfer of electrons and protons between electrode and electrolyte. The working mechanisms of pseudocapacitors are redox reactions, intercalation and electrosorption.

=== Marcus ===

The physical and mathematical basics of electron charge transfer absent chemical bonds leading to pseudocapacitance was developed by [[Rudolph A. Marcus]]. [[Marcus Theory]] explains the rates of electron transfer reactions—the rate at which an electron can move from one chemical species to another. It was originally formulated to address [[outer sphere electron transfer]] reactions, in which two chemical species change only in their charge, with an electron jumping. For redox reactions without making or breaking bonds, Marcus theory takes the place of [[Henry Eyring (chemist)|Henry Eyring]]'s [[transition state theory]] which was derived for reactions with structural changes. Marcus received the [[List of Nobel laureates in Chemistry|Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1992 for this theory.&lt;ref name=nobel&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/1992/index.html Rudolph A.

[[File:DoubleLayer.gif|thumb|360px|detailed illustration of interfacial DL]]

As stated by Lyklema, "...the reason for the formation of a "relaxed" ("equilibrium") double layer is the non-electric affinity of charge-determining ions for a surface..."&lt;ref name="Lyklema"&gt;Lyklema, J. "Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science", vol.2, page.3.208, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This process leads to the buildup of an [[electric surface charge]], expressed usually in C/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This surface charge creates an electrostatic field that then affects the ions in the bulk of the liquid. This electrostatic field, in combination with the thermal motion of the ions, creates a counter charge, and thus screens the electric surface charge. The net electric charge in this screening diffuse layer is equal in magnitude to the net surface charge, but has the opposite polarity. As a result, the complete structure is electrically neutral.

The diffuse layer, or at least part of it, can move under the influence of [[tangential]] [[Stress (physics)|stress]]. There is a conventionally introduced slipping plane that separates mobile fluid from fluid that remains attached to the surface. Electric potential at this plane is called [[electrokinetic potential]] or [[zeta potential]] (also denoted as ζ-potential).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Ian D.|last1=Morrison|first2=Sydney|last2=Ross|title=Colloidal dispersions : suspensions, emulsions, and foams|date=2002|publisher=Wiley|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-471-17625-1|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Jingkun|last2=Oberdörster|first2=Günter|last3=Biswas|first3=Pratim|title=Characterization of size, surface charge, and agglomeration state of nanoparticle dispersions for toxicological studies|journal=Journal of Nanoparticle Research|date=25 June 2008|volume=11|issue=1|pages=77–89|doi=10.1007/s11051-008-9446-4|bibcode=2009JNR....11...77J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electric potential on the external boundary of the Stern layer versus the bulk electrolyte is referred to as [[Stern potential]]. Electric potential difference between the fluid bulk and the surface is called the electric surface potential.

Usually [[zeta potential]] is used for estimating the degree of DL charge. A characteristic value of this electric potential in the DL is 25 mV with a maximum value around 100 mV (up to several volts on electrodes&lt;ref name=Kirby /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V.S. Bogotsky, Fundamentals of Electrochemistry, Wiley-Interscience, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;). The chemical composition of the sample at which the ζ-potential is 0 is called the [[point of zero charge]] or the [[iso-electric point]]. It is usually determined by the solution pH value, since protons and hydroxyl ions are the charge-determining ions for most surfaces.&lt;ref name=Kirby /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lyklema /&gt;

Zeta potential can be measured using [[electrophoresis]], [[electroacoustic phenomena]], [[streaming potential]], and [[electroosmotic flow]].

The characteristic thickness of the DL is the [[Debye length]], κ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. It is reciprocally proportional to the square root of the ion concentration ''C''. In aqueous solutions it is typically on the scale of a few nanometers and the thickness decreases with increasing concentration of the electrolyte.

The electric field strength inside the DL can be anywhere from zero to over 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;V/m. These steep electric potential gradients are the reason for the importance of the DLs.

The theory for a flat surface and a symmetrical electrolyte&lt;ref name="Lyklema" /&gt; is usually referred to as the Gouy-Chapman theory. It yields a simple relationship between electric charge in the diffuse layer σ&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; and the Stern potential Ψ&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Hanaor| first1=D.A.H.| last2=Ghadiri| first2=M.

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma^d = -\sqrt{{8\varepsilon_0}{\varepsilon_m}CRT}\sinh \frac{F\Psi^d}{2RT}&lt;/math&gt;

There is no general analytical solution for mixed electrolytes, curved surfaces or even spherical particles. There is an asymptotic solution for spherical particles with low charged DLs. In the case when electric potential over DL is less than 25 mV, the so-called Debye-Huckel approximation holds. It yields the following expression for electric potential'' Ψ'' in the spherical DL as a function of the distance ''r'' from the particle center:

:&lt;math&gt; {\Psi}(r) = {\Psi^d}\frac{a}{r}\exp({-\kappa}(r-a))&lt;/math&gt;

There are several asymptotic models which play important roles in theoretical developments associated with the interfacial DL.

The first one is "thin DL". This model assumes that DL is much thinner than the colloidal particle or capillary radius. This restricts the value of the Debye length and particle radius as following:

:&lt;math&gt;     {\kappa}a &gt;&gt;1    &lt;/math&gt;

This model offers tremendous simplifications for many subsequent applications. Theory of [[electrophoresis]] is just one example.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, R.J. "Foundations of Colloid Science", Oxford University Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of [[electroacoustic phenomena]] is another example.&lt;ref name="Dukhin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dukhin |first=A.S. |authorlink= |author2=Goetz, P.J. |editor= |others= |title=Ultrasound for Characterizing Colloids |origyear= |month= |url= |format= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2002 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=33 |chapter=Electroacoustic Theory |chapterurl=http://www.dispersion.com/pages/theory/psd/modeltheory.html |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thin DL model is valid for most aqueous systems because the Debye length is only a few nanometers in such cases. It breaks down only for nano-colloids in solution with ionic strengths close to water.

The opposing "thick DL" model assumes that the Debye length is larger than particle radius:

:&lt;math&gt;     {\kappa}a &lt;1    &lt;/math&gt;

This model can be useful for some nano-colloids and non-polar fluids, where the Debye length is much larger.

The last model introduces "overlapped DLs".&lt;ref name="Dukhin" /&gt; This is important in concentrated dispersions and emulsions when distances between particles become comparable with the Debye length.

== Electrical double layers ==
The '''electrical double layer''' ('''EDL''') is the result of the variation of [[electric potential]] near a surface, and has a significant influence on the behaviour of [[colloid]]s and other surfaces in contact with [[solution]]s or solid-state [[fast ion conductor]]s. 

The primary difference between a double layer on an electrode and one on an interface is the mechanisms of [[surface charge]] formation. With an electrode, it is possible to regulate the surface charge by applying an external electric potential. This application, however, is impossible in colloidal and porous double layers, because for colloidal particles, one does not have access to the interior of the particle to apply a potential difference.

EDLs are analogous to the [[double layer (plasma)|double layer]] in [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. 

=== Differential capacitance ===
{{Main article|Differential capacitance}}
EDLs have an additional parameter defining their characterization: [[differential capacitance]]. Differential capacitance, denoted as ''C'', is described by the equation below:

:&lt;math&gt; C = \frac{d \sigma}{ d \Psi}&lt;/math&gt;

where σ is the [[surface charge]] and ψ is the [[electric surface potential]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6177">'''Dynamical dimensional reduction''' or '''spontaneous dimensional reduction''' is the apparent reduction in the number of spacetime dimensions as a function of the distance scale, or conversely the energy scale, with which spacetime is probed. At least within the current level of experimental precision, our universe has three dimensions of space and one of time. However, the idea that the number of dimensions may increase at extremely small length scales was first proposed more than a century ago,&lt;ref&gt;Nordstrom, G. Z. Phys. 15 (1914) 504.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now fairly commonplace in theoretical physics. Contrary to this, a number of recent results in quantum gravity suggest the opposite behavior, a dynamical reduction of the number of spacetime dimensions at small length scales. 
== Evidence for dimensional reduction==
The phenomenon of dimensional reduction has now been reported in a number of different approaches to quantum gravity. String theory,&lt;ref&gt;Atick, J. J. Witten, E.; [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0550321388901514?via%3Dihub The Hagedorn Transition and the Number of Degrees of Freedom of String Theory].&lt;/ref&gt; causal dynamical triangulations,&lt;ref&gt;Ambjorn, J. Jurkiewicz, J. Loll, R.; [https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.171301 Spectral Dimension of the Universe].&lt;/ref&gt; renormalization group approaches,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lauscher, O. M. Reuter, E.; [http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1126-6708/2005/10/050/meta Fractal Spacetime Structure in Asymptotically Safe Gravity].&lt;/ref&gt; noncommutative geometry,&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti, D.; Fractal properties of quantum spacetime [https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1396 arXiv:0811.1396].&lt;/ref&gt; loop quantum gravity&lt;ref&gt;Modesto, L.; Fractal Structure of Loop Quantum Gravity [https://arxiv.org/abs/0812.2214 arXiv:0812.2214].&lt;/ref&gt; and Horava-Lifshitz gravity&lt;ref&gt;Horava, P.; Spectral Dimension of the Universe in Quantum Gravity at a Lifshitz Point [https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.3657 arXiv:0902.3657].&lt;/ref&gt; all find that the dimensionality of spacetime appears to decrease from approximately 4 on large distance scales to approximately 2 on small distance scales. 

The evidence for dimensional reduction has come mainly, although not exclusively, from calculations of the spectral dimension. The spectral dimension is a measure of the effective dimension of a manifold at different resolution scales. Early numerical simulations within the [[Causal_dynamical_triangulation|causal dynamical triangulation]] (CDT) approach to quantum gravity found a spectral dimension of 4.02 ± 0.10 at large distances and 1.80 ± 0.25 at small distances. This result created significant interest in dimensional reduction within the quantum gravity community. A more recent study of the same point in the parameter space of CDT found consistent results, namely 4.05 ± 0.17 at large distances and 1.97 ± 0.27 at small distances.&lt;ref&gt;Coumbe, D. N. Jurkiewicz, J.; [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FJHEP03%282015%29151 Evidence for Asymptotic Safety from Dimensional Reduction in Causal Dynamical Triangulations,][https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7712 arXiv:1411.7712].&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there is no consensus on the correct theoretical explanation for the mechanism of dimensional reduction.  

== Possible explanations ==

The ubiquity and consistency of dimensional reduction in quantum gravity has driven the search for a theoretical understanding of this phenomenon. Currently, there exist few proposed explanations for the observation of dimensional reduction. 

One proposal is that of scale invariance. There is growing evidence that gravity may be nonperturbatively renormalizable as described by the asymptotic safety program, which requires the existence of a non-Gaussian fixed point at high energies towards which the couplings defining the theory flow.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; At such a fixed point gravity must be scale invariant, and hence Newton's constant must be dimensionless. Only in 2-dimensional spacetime is Newton's constant dimensionless, and so in this scenario going to higher energies and hence flowing towards the fixed point should correspond to the dimensionality of spacetime reducing to the value 2. This explanation is not entirely satisfying as it does not explain why such a fixed point should exist in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Carlip, S.; Spontaneous Dimensional Reduction in Short-Distance Quantum Gravity? [https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3329 arXiv:0909.3329].&lt;/ref&gt;

A second possible explanation for dimensional reduction is that of asymptotic silence. General relativity exhibits so-called asymptotic silence in the vicinity of a spacelike singularity, which is the narrowing or focusing of light cones close to the Planck scale leading to a causal decoupling of nearby spacetime points. In this scenario, each point has a preferred spatial direction, and geodesics see a reduced (1 + 1)-dimensional spacetime.&lt;ref&gt;Carlip, S.; Dimension and Dimensional Reduction in Quantum Gravity [https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05417 arXiv:1705.05417].&lt;/ref&gt;

Dimensional reduction implies a deformation or violation of Lorentz invariance and typically predicts an energy dependent speed of light.&lt;ref&gt;Sotiriou, T. Visser, M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10327">'''Electroacoustic phenomena''' arise when [[ultrasound]] propagates through a [[fluid]] containing [[ions]]. The associated particle motion generates [[electric]] signals because ions have [[electric charge]]. This coupling between ultrasound and [[electric field]] is called electroacoustic phenomena. The fluid might be a simple [[Newtonian liquid]], or complex [[heterogeneous]] [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]], [[emulsion]] or even a porous body. There are several different electroacoustic effects depending on the nature of the fluid.

*[[Ion vibration current]] (IVI) and potential, an [[electric]] signal that arises when an [[acoustic wave]] propagates through a [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] fluid.
*[[Streaming vibration current]] (SVI) and potential, an electric signal that arises when an acoustic wave propagates through a porous body in which the pores are filled with fluid.
*[[Colloid vibration current]] (CVI) and potential, an electric signal that arises when ultrasound propagates through a [[heterogeneous]] fluid, such as a [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] or [[emulsion]].
*[[Electric sonic amplitude]] (ESA), the inverse of the CVI effect, in which an acoustic field arises when an [[electric field]] propagates through a [[heterogeneous]] fluid.

==Ion vibration current==
{{main|Ion vibration current}}
Historically, the IVI was the first known electroacoustic effect. It was predicted by Debye in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Debye.P."A method for the determination of the mass of electrolyte ions"J. Chem. Phys., 1,13-16,1933&lt;/ref&gt;

==Streaming vibration current==
{{main|Streaming vibration current}}
The streaming vibration current was experimentally observed in 1948 by Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Williams.M. " An Electrokinetic Transducer" The review of scientific instruments, 19, 10, 640-646, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; A theoretical model was developed some 30 years later by Dukhin and others.&lt;ref&gt;Dukhin, S.S., Mischuk, N.A., Kuz'menko, B.B and Il'in, B.I. "Flow current and potential in a high-frequency acoustic field" Colloid J., 45, 5, 875-881,1983&lt;/ref&gt; This effect opens another possibility for characterizing the electric properties of the surfaces in porous bodies. A similar effect can be observed at a non-porous surface, when sound is bounced off at an oblique angle. The incident and reflected waves superimpose to cause oscillatory fluid motion in the plane of the interface, thereby generating an AC streaming current at the frequency of the sound waves.&lt;ref&gt;Glauser, A.R., Robertson P.A., Lowe, C.R., "An electrokinetic sensor for studying immersed surfaces, using focused ultrasound" Sensors Actuators B, 80, 1, 68-82, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double layer compression==
The [[electrical double layer]] can be regarded as behaving like a parallel plate capacitor with a compressible dielectric filling. When sound waves induce a local pressure variation, the spacing of the plates varies at the frequency of the excitation, generating an AC displacement current normal to the interface. For practical reasons this is most readily observed at a conducting surface.&lt;ref&gt;F.I. Kukoz, L.A. Kukoz, "The nature of audioelectro-chemical phenomena" Russ. J. Phys. Chem. 36 (1962) pp. 367-369&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore possible to use an electrode immersed in a conducting electrolyte as a microphone, or indeed as a loudspeaker when the effect is applied in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;N. Tankovsky, "Capacitive ultrasound transducer, based on the electrical double layer in electrolytes" J. App. Phys. 87 (2000) pp. 538-542&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colloid vibration potential and current==
{{main|Colloid vibration current}}
Colloid vibration potential measures the AC potential difference generated between two identical relaxed electrodes, placed in the dispersion, if the latter is subjected to an ultrasonic field. When a sound wave travels through a colloidal suspension of particles whose density differs from that of the surrounding medium, inertial forces induced by the vibration of the suspension give rise to a motion of the charged particles relative to the liquid, causing an alternating electromotive force. The manifestations of this electromotive force may be measured, depending on the relation between the impedance of the suspension and that of the measuring instrument, either as colloid vibration potential or as ''colloid vibration current''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Colloid vibration potential and current was first reported by Hermans and then independently by Rutgers in 1938. It is widely used for characterizing the ζ-potential of various dispersions and emulsions. The effect, theory, experimental verification and multiple applications are discussed in the book by Dukhin and Goetz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dukhin |first=A.S. |authorlink= |author2=Goetz, P.J. |title=Ultrasound for Characterizing Colloids |accessdate=2007-10-03 |date=2002 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |pages=153 |chapter=Electroacoustic Theory |chapterurl=http://www.dispersion.com/pages/theory/electroacoustictheory/electoracoustictheory.html |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electric sonic amplitude==
{{main|Electric sonic amplitude}}
Electric sonic amplitude was experimentally discovered by Cannon with co-authors in early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Oja, T., Petersen, G., and Cannon, D. "Measurement of Electric-Kinetic Properties of a Solution", US Patent 4,497,208,1985&lt;/ref&gt; It is also widely used for characterizing ζ-potential in dispersions and emulsions. There is review of this effect theory, experimental verification and multiple applications published by Hunter.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, R.J. "Review. Recent developments in the electroacoustic characterization of colloidal suspensions and emulsions", Colloids and Surfaces, 141, 37-65, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of CVI and ESA==
With regard to the theory of CVI and ESA, there was an important observation made by O'Brien,&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, R.W. "Electro-acoustic effects in a dilute suspension of spherical particles" J. Fluid Mech., 190, 71-86,1988&lt;/ref&gt; who linked these measured parameters with [[dynamic electrophoretic mobility]] μ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; \ CVI(ESA) = A\phi\mu_d\frac{\rho_p-\rho_m}{\rho_m}&lt;/math&gt;

where
: A is calibration constant, depending on frequency, but not particles properties;
: ρ&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is particle density,
: ρ&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; density of the fluid,
: φ is volume fraction of dispersed phase,

Dynamic electrophoretic mobility is similar to [[electrophoretic mobility]] that appears in [[electrophoresis]] theory. They are identical at low frequencies and/or for sufficiently small particles.

There are several theories of the dynamic electrophoretic mobility. Their overview is given in the Ref.5. Two of them are the most important.

The first one corresponds to the Smoluchowski limit. It yields following simple expression for CVI for sufficiently small particles with negligible CVI frequency dependence:

:&lt;math&gt; \ CVI(ESA) = A\phi\frac{\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_m\zeta\Kappa_s}{\eta\Kappa_m}\frac{\rho_p-\rho_s}{\rho_s}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: ε&lt;sub&gt;''0''&lt;/sub&gt; is vacuum dielectric permittivity,
: ε&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is fluid dielectric permittivity,
: ζ is [[electrokinetic potential]]
: η is dynamic viscosity of the fluid,
: K&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is conductivity of the system,
: K&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is conductivity of the fluid,
: ρ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is density of the system.

This remarkably simple equation has same wide range of applicability as Smoluchowski equation  for [[electrophoresis]]. It is independent on shape of the particles, their concentration.

Validity of this equation is restricted with the following two requirements.
  
First, it is valid only for a thin [[Double layer (interfacial)|double layer]], when the [[Debye length]] is much smaller than particle's radius a:
:&lt;math&gt; {\kappa}a &gt;&gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

Secondly, it neglects the contribution of the [[surface conductivity]]. This assumes a small [[Dukhin number]]:
:&lt;math&gt; Du &lt;&lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

Restriction of the thin double layer limits applicability of this Smoluchowski type theory only to aqueous systems with sufficiently large particles and not very low ionic strength. This theory does not work well for nano-colloids, including proteins and polymers at low ionic strength. It is not valid for low- or non-polar fluids.

There is another theory that is applicable for the other extreme case of a thick double layer, when  
:&lt;math&gt; {\kappa}a &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

This theory takes into consideration the double layer overlap that inevitably occurs for concentrated systems with thick double layer. This allows introduction of so-called "quasi-homogeneous" approach, when overlapped diffuse layers of particles cover the complete interparticle space. The theory becomes much simplified in this extreme case, as shown by Shilov and others.&lt;ref&gt;Shilov, V.N., Borkovskaya, Y.B. and Dukhin A.S. "Electroacoustic theory for concentrated colloids with overlapped DLs at arbitrary ka. Application to nanocolloids and nonaqueous colloids". JCIS, 277, 347-358 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Their derivation predicts that surface charge density σ is a better parameter than ζ-potential for characterizing electroacoustic phenomena in such systems. An expression for CVI simplified for small particles follows:

:&lt;math&gt; \ CVI = A\frac{2{\sigma}a}{3\eta}\frac{\phi}{1-\phi}\frac{\rho_p-\rho_s}{\rho_s}&lt;/math&gt;

In [[physics]], '''energy''' is the [[physical quantity|quantitative]] [[physical property|property]] that must be [[#Energy transfer|transferred]] to an [[Physical body|object]] in order to perform [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] on, or to [[heat]], the object.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The [[second law of thermodynamics]] imposes limitations on the capacity of a system to transfer energy by performing work, since some of the system's energy might necessarily be {{em|[[waste heat|consumed]]}} in the form of [[heat]] instead. See e.g. {{cite journal |last1=Lehrman |first1=Robert L. |title=Energy Is Not The Ability To Do Work |journal=The Physics Teacher |volume=11 |issue=1 |year=1973 |pages=15–18 |issn=0031-921X |doi=10.1119/1.2349846|bibcode=1973PhTea..11...15L }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Energy is a [[Conservation law|conserved quantity]]; the law of [[conservation of energy]] states that energy can be [[Energy transformation|converted]] in form, but not created or destroyed. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of energy is the [[joule]], which is the energy transferred to an object by the [[work (physics)|work]] of moving it a distance of 1 [[metre]] against a [[force]] of 1 [[newton (unit)|newton]].

Common forms of energy include the [[kinetic energy]] of a moving object, the [[potential energy]] stored by an object's position in a force [[Classical field theory|field]] ([[gravitational field|gravitational]], [[electric field|electric]] or [[magnetic field|magnetic]]), the [[elastic energy]] stored by stretching solid objects, the [[chemical energy]] released when a fuel [[combustion|burns]], the [[radiant energy]] carried by light, and the [[thermal energy]] due to an object's [[temperature]].

[[Mass]] and energy are closely related. Due to [[mass–energy equivalence]], any object that has mass when stationary (called [[rest mass]]) also has an equivalent amount of energy whose form is called [[rest mass#Rest energy|rest energy]], and any additional energy (of any form) acquired by the object above that rest energy will increase the object's total mass just as it increases its total energy. For example, after heating an object, its increase in energy could be measured as a small increase in mass, with a sensitive enough [[weighing scale|scale]].

Living organisms require [[available energy]] to stay alive, such as the [[Food energy|energy humans get from food]].  Human civilization requires energy to function, which it gets from  [[energy resource]]s such as [[fossil fuel]]s, [[nuclear fuel]], or [[renewable energy]]. The processes of Earth's [[climate]] and [[ecosystem]] are driven by the radiant energy Earth receives from the sun and the [[geothermal energy]] contained within the earth.

==Forms==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}

[[File:Lightning over Oradea Romania zoom.jpg|thumb|In a typical [[lightning]] strike, 500 [[megajoule]]s of [[electric potential energy]] is converted into the same amount of energy in other forms, mostly [[light energy]], [[sound energy]] and [[thermal energy]].]]
[[File:Hot metalwork.jpg|thumb|[[Thermal energy]] is energy of microscopic constituents of matter, which may include both [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential energy]].]]

The total energy of a [[system]] can be subdivided and classified into potential energy, kinetic energy, or combinations of the two in various ways. [[Kinetic energy]] is determined by the [[motion (physics)|movement]] of an object – or the [[statistical mechanics|composite motion]] of the components of an object – and [[potential energy]] reflects the potential of an object to have motion, and generally is a function of the position of an object within a [[Field (physics)|field]] or may stored in the field itself.

While these two categories are sufficient to describe all forms of energy, it is often convenient to refer to particular combinations of potential and kinetic energy as its own form. For example, macroscopic [[mechanical energy]] is the sum of translational and rotational kinetic and potential energy in a system neglects the kinetic energy due to temperature, and nuclear energy which combines utilize potentials from the [[nuclear force]] and the [[weak force]]), among others.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

{{Main article|History of energy|timeline of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and random processes|}}
[[File:Thomas Young (scientist).jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] – the first to use the term "energy" in the modern sense.]]
The word ''energy'' derives from the {{lang-grc|ἐνέργεια|[[energeia]]|activity, operation}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=energy |title=Energy |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |accessdate=May 1, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011122441/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=energy |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which possibly appears for the first time in the work of [[Aristotle]] in the 4th century BC. In contrast to the modern definition, energeia was a qualitative philosophical concept, broad enough to include ideas such as happiness and pleasure.

In the late 17th century, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] proposed the idea of the {{lang-lat|[[vis viva]]}}, or living force, which defined as the product of the mass of an object and its velocity squared; he believed that total ''vis viva'' was conserved. To account for slowing due to friction, Leibniz theorized that thermal energy consisted of the random motion of the constituent parts of matter, although it would be more than a century until this was generally accepted. The modern analog of this property, [[kinetic energy]], differs from ''vis viva'' only by a factor of two.

In 1807, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] was possibly the first to use the term "energy" instead of ''vis viva'', in its modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Smith | first = Crosbie | title = The Science of Energy – a Cultural History of Energy Physics in Victorian Britain | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-226-76420-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis]] described "[[kinetic energy]]" in 1829 in its modern sense, and in 1853, [[William John Macquorn Rankine|William Rankine]] coined the term "[[potential energy]]". The law of [[conservation of energy]] was also first postulated in the early 19th century, and applies to any [[isolated system]]. It was argued for some years whether heat was a physical substance, dubbed the [[caloric theory|caloric]], or merely a physical quantity, such as [[momentum]]. In 1845 [[James Prescott Joule]] discovered the link between mechanical work and the generation of heat.

These developments led to the theory of conservation of energy, formalized largely by William Thomson ([[Lord Kelvin]]) as the field of [[thermodynamics]]. Thermodynamics aided the rapid development of explanations of chemical processes by [[Rudolf Clausius]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], and [[Walther Nernst]]. It also led to a mathematical formulation of the concept of [[entropy]] by Clausius and to the introduction of laws of [[radiant energy]] by [[Jožef Stefan]]. According to [[Noether's theorem]], the conservation of energy is a consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time.&lt;ref name="jphysics"&gt;{{Cite book| last =Lofts| first =G|author2=O'Keeffe D |display-authors=etal | title=Jacaranda Physics 1| publisher =John Willey &amp; Sons Australia Ltd. | year =2004| location = Milton, Queensland, Australia| page = 286| chapter=11 – Mechanical Interactions| edition=2| isbn=978-0-7016-3777-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, since 1918, theorists have understood that the law of [[conservation of energy]] is the direct mathematical consequence of the [[translational symmetry]] of the quantity [[conjugate variables|conjugate]] to energy, namely time.

==Units of measure==
[[File:Joule's Apparatus (Harper's Scan).png|thumb|right|Joule's apparatus for measuring the mechanical equivalent of heat. A descending weight attached to a string causes a paddle immersed in water to rotate.]]
{{Main article|Units of energy}}

In 1843, [[James Prescott Joule]] independently discovered the mechanical equivalent in a series of experiments. The most famous of them used the "Joule apparatus": a descending weight, attached to a string, caused rotation of a paddle immersed in water, practically insulated from heat transfer. It showed that the gravitational [[potential energy]] lost by the weight in descending was equal to the [[internal energy]] gained by the water through [[friction]] with the paddle.

In the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the unit of energy is the joule, named after James Prescott Joule. It is a [[SI derived unit|derived unit]]. It is equal to the energy expended (or [[Work (physics)|work]] done) in applying a force of one newton through a distance of one metre. However energy is also expressed in many other units not part of the SI, such as [[erg]]s, [[calorie]]s, [[British Thermal Unit]]s, [[kilowatt-hour]]s and [[kilocalorie]]s, which require a conversion factor when expressed in SI units.

The SI unit of energy rate (energy per unit time) is the [[watt]], which is a joule per second.  Thus, one joule is one watt-second, and 3600 joules equal one watt-hour.  The [[centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]] energy unit is the [[erg]] and the [[imperial and US customary measurement systems|imperial and US customary]] unit is the [[foot pound]]. Other energy units such as the [[electronvolt]], [[food calorie]] or thermodynamic [[kilocalorie|kcal]] (based on the temperature change of water in a heating process), and [[British thermal unit|BTU]] are used in specific areas of science and commerce.

==Scientific use==

===Classical mechanics===
{{Classical mechanics}}
{{Main article|Mechanics|Mechanical work|Thermodynamics}}

In classical mechanics, energy is a conceptually and mathematically useful property, as it is a [[conserved quantity]]. Several formulations of mechanics have been developed using energy as a core concept.

[[Work (physics)|Work]], a function of energy, is force times distance.

: &lt;math&gt; W = \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;

This says that the work (&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;) is equal to the [[line integral]] of the [[force]] '''F''' along a path ''C''; for details see the [[mechanical work]] article. Work and thus energy is [[frame dependent]]. For example, consider a ball being hit by a bat. In the center-of-mass reference frame, the bat does no work on the ball. But, in the reference frame of the person swinging the bat, considerable work is done on the ball.

The total energy of a system is sometimes called the [[Hamilton's equations|Hamiltonian]], after [[William Rowan Hamilton]]. The classical equations of motion can be written in terms of the Hamiltonian, even for highly complex or abstract systems. These classical equations have remarkably direct analogs in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071011135413/http://www.sustech.edu/OCWExternal/Akamai/18/18.013a/textbook/HTML/chapter16/section03.html The Hamiltonian] MIT OpenCourseWare website 18.013A Chapter 16.3 Accessed February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Another energy-related concept is called the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]], after [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]]. This formalism is as fundamental as the Hamiltonian, and both can be used to derive the equations of motion or be derived from them. It was invented in the context of [[classical mechanics]], but is generally useful in modern physics. The Lagrangian is defined as the kinetic energy ''minus'' the potential energy. Usually, the Lagrange formalism is mathematically more convenient than the Hamiltonian for non-conservative systems (such as systems with friction).

[[Noether's theorem]] (1918) states that any differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law. Noether's theorem has become a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics and the calculus of variations. A generalisation of the seminal formulations on constants of motion in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics (1788 and 1833, respectively), it does not apply to systems that cannot be modeled with a Lagrangian; for example, dissipative systems with continuous symmetries need not have a corresponding conservation law.

===Chemistry===&lt;!-- courtesy note per [[WP:LINK2SECT]]: redirect [[Energy (chemistry)]] links here --&gt;
In the context of [[Chemistry#Energy|chemistry]], energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its atomic, molecular or aggregate structure. Since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structure, it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease of energy of the substances involved. Some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or light; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants. A reaction is said to be [[exergonic]] if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state; in the case of [[endergonic]] reactions the situation is the reverse. [[Chemical reaction]]s are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the [[activation energy]]. The ''speed'' of a chemical reaction (at given temperature&amp;nbsp;''T'') is related to the activation energy&amp;nbsp;''E'', by the Boltzmann's population factor&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−''E''/''kT''&lt;/sup&gt;{{spaced ndash}}that is the probability of molecule to have energy greater than or equal to&amp;nbsp;''E'' at the given temperature&amp;nbsp;''T''. This exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the [[Arrhenius equation]].The activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction can be in the form of thermal energy.

{{anchor|Biology}}In [[biology#Energy|biology]], energy is an attribute of all biological systems from the biosphere to the smallest living [[organism]]. Within an organism it is responsible for growth and development of a biological [[Cell (biology)|cell]] or an [[organelle]] of a biological [[organism]]. Energy is thus often said to be stored by [[Cell (biology)|cells]] in the structures of molecules of substances such as [[carbohydrate]]s (including sugars), [[lipid]]s, and [[protein]]s, which release energy when reacted with [[oxygen]] in [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. In human terms, the [[human equivalent]] (H-e) (Human energy conversion) indicates, for a given amount of energy expenditure, the relative quantity of energy needed for human [[metabolism]], assuming an average human energy expenditure of 12,500&amp;nbsp;kJ per day and a [[basal metabolic rate]] of 80 watts. For example, if our bodies run (on average) at 80 watts, then a light bulb running at 100 watts is running at 1.25 human equivalents (100 ÷ 80) i.e. 1.25 H-e. For a difficult task of only a few seconds' duration, a person can put out thousands of watts, many times the 746 watts in one official horsepower. For tasks lasting a few minutes, a fit human can generate perhaps 1,000 watts. For an activity that must be sustained for an hour, output drops to around 300; for an activity kept up all day, 150 watts is about the maximum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uic.edu/aa/college/gallery400/notions/human%20energy.htm |title=Retrieved on May-29-09 |publisher=Uic.edu |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604191319/http://www.uic.edu/aa/college/gallery400/notions/human%20energy.htm |archivedate=2010-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The human equivalent assists understanding of energy flows in physical and biological systems by expressing energy units in human terms: it provides a "feel" for the use of a given amount of energy.&lt;ref&gt;Bicycle calculator – speed, weight, wattage etc. {{cite web |url=http://bikecalculator.com/ |title=Bike Calculator |accessdate=2009-05-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513091201/http://bikecalculator.com/ |archivedate=2009-05-13 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunlight's radiant energy is also captured by plants as ''chemical potential energy'' in [[photosynthesis]], when carbon dioxide and water (two low-energy compounds) are converted into the high-energy compounds carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Plants also release oxygen during photosynthesis, which is utilized by living organisms as an [[electron acceptor]], to release the energy of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Release of the energy stored during photosynthesis as heat or light may be triggered suddenly by a spark, in a forest fire, or it may be made available more slowly for animal or human metabolism, when these molecules are ingested, and [[catabolism]] is triggered by [[enzyme]] action.

Any living organism relies on an external source of energy – radiant energy from the Sun in the case of green plants, chemical energy in some form in the case of animals – to be able to grow and reproduce. The daily 1500–2000&amp;nbsp;[[kilocalorie|Calories]] (6–8&amp;nbsp;MJ) recommended for a human adult are taken as a combination of oxygen and food molecules, the latter mostly carbohydrates and fats, of which [[glucose]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[stearin]] (C&lt;sub&gt;57&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;110&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) are convenient examples. The food molecules are oxidised to [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water (molecule)|water]] in the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]]
::&lt;chem&gt;C6H12O6 + 6O2 -&gt; 6CO2 + 6H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
::C&lt;sub&gt;57&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;110&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 81.5O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 57CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 55H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
and some of the energy is used to convert [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] into [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].
::ADP + HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; → ATP + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
The rest of the chemical energy in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr 15"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidt-Rohr | first1 = K | year = 2015 | title = Why Combustions Are Always Exothermic, Yielding About 418 kJ per Mole of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; | doi = 10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00333 | journal = J.

Only a tiny fraction of the original chemical energy is used for work:&lt;ref group=note&gt;These examples are solely for illustration, as it is not the energy available for work which limits the performance of the athlete but the [[power (physics)|power]] output of the sprinter and the [[force (physics)|force]] of the weightlifter. A worker stacking shelves in a supermarket does more work (in the physical sense) than either of the athletes, but does it more slowly.&lt;/ref&gt;

:gain in gravitational potential energy of a 150&amp;nbsp;kg weight lifted through 2&amp;nbsp;metres: 3&amp;nbsp;kJ

It would appear that living organisms are remarkably [[Energy conversion efficiency|inefficient (in the physical sense)]] in their use of the energy they receive (chemical or radiant energy), and it is true that most real [[machine]]s manage higher efficiencies. In growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat serves a vital purpose, as it allows the organism tissue to be highly ordered with regard to the molecules it is built from. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that energy (and matter) tends to become more evenly spread out across the universe: to concentrate energy (or matter) in one specific place, it is necessary to spread out a greater amount of energy (as heat) across the remainder of the universe ("the surroundings").&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Crystal]]s are another example of highly ordered systems that exist in nature: in this case too, the order is associated with the transfer of a large amount of heat (known as the [[lattice energy]]) to the surroundings.&lt;/ref&gt; Simpler organisms can achieve higher energy efficiencies than more complex ones, but the complex organisms can occupy [[ecological niche]]s that are not available to their simpler brethren. The conversion of a portion of the chemical energy to heat at each step in a metabolic pathway is the physical reason behind the pyramid of biomass observed in [[ecology]]: to take just the first step in the [[food chain]], of the estimated 124.7&amp;nbsp;Pg/a of carbon that is [[carbon fixation|fixed]] by [[photosynthesis]], 64.3&amp;nbsp;Pg/a (52%) are used for the metabolism of green plants,&lt;ref&gt;Ito, Akihito; Oikawa, Takehisa (2004).

===Earth sciences===
In [[Earth science#earth's energy|geology]], [[continental drift]], [[mountain|mountain ranges]], [[volcano]]es, and [[earthquake]]s are phenomena that can be explained in terms of energy transformations in the Earth's interior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://okfirst.ocs.ou.edu/train/meteorology/EnergyBudget.html |title=Earth's Energy Budget |publisher=Okfirst.ocs.ou.edu |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827194704/http://okfirst.ocs.ou.edu/train/meteorology/EnergyBudget.html |archivedate=2008-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[metereology|meteorological]] phenomena like wind, rain, [[hail]], snow, lightning, [[tornado]]es and [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] are all a result of energy transformations brought about by [[solar energy]] on the [[atmosphere]] of the planet Earth.

Sunlight may be stored as gravitational potential energy after it strikes the Earth, as (for example) water evaporates from oceans and is deposited upon mountains (where, after being released at a hydroelectric dam, it can be used to drive turbines or generators to produce electricity). Sunlight also drives many weather phenomena, save those generated by volcanic events. An example of a solar-mediated weather event is a hurricane, which occurs when large unstable areas of warm ocean, heated over months, give up some of their thermal energy suddenly to power a few days of violent air movement.

In a slower process, [[radioactive decay]] of atoms in the core of the Earth releases heat. This thermal energy drives [[plate tectonics]] and may lift mountains, via [[orogenesis]]. This slow lifting represents a kind of gravitational potential energy storage of the thermal energy, which may be later released to active kinetic energy in landslides, after a triggering event. Earthquakes also release stored elastic potential energy in rocks, a store that has been produced ultimately from the same radioactive heat sources. Thus, according to present understanding, familiar events such as landslides and earthquakes release energy that has been stored as potential energy in the Earth's gravitational field or elastic strain (mechanical potential energy) in rocks. Prior to this, they represent release of energy that has been stored in heavy atoms since the collapse of long-destroyed supernova stars created these atoms.

===Cosmology===&lt;!-- courtesy note per [[WP:LINK2SECT]]: redirect [[Energy (cosmology)]] links here --&gt;
In [[Physical cosmology#Energy of the cosmos|cosmology and astronomy]] the phenomena of [[star]]s, [[nova]], [[supernova]], [[quasar]]s and [[gamma-ray burst]]s are the universe's highest-output energy transformations of matter. All [[wikt:stellar|stellar]] phenomena (including solar activity) are driven by various kinds of energy transformations. Energy in such transformations is either from gravitational collapse of matter (usually molecular hydrogen) into various classes of astronomical objects (stars, black holes, etc.), or from nuclear fusion (of lighter elements, primarily hydrogen). The [[nuclear fusion]] of hydrogen in the Sun also releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the [[Big Bang]]. At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This meant that hydrogen represents a store of potential energy that can be released by fusion. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight.

===Quantum mechanics===
{{Main article|Energy operator}}
In [[quantum mechanics]], energy is defined in terms of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|energy operator]]
as a time derivative of the [[wave function]]. The [[Schrödinger equation]] equates the energy operator to the full energy of a particle or a system. Its results can be considered as a definition of measurement of energy in quantum mechanics. The Schrödinger equation describes the space- and time-dependence of a slowly changing (non-relativistic) [[wave function]] of quantum systems. The solution of this equation for a bound system is discrete (a set of permitted states, each characterized by an [[energy level]]) which results in the concept of [[quantum|quanta]]. In the solution of the Schrödinger equation for any oscillator (vibrator) and for electromagnetic waves in a vacuum, the resulting energy states are related to the frequency by [[Planck's relation]]: &lt;math&gt;E = h\nu&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; the frequency). In the case of an electromagnetic wave these energy states are called quanta of light or [[photon]]s.

===Relativity===
When calculating kinetic energy ([[Mechanical work|work]] to accelerate a [[mass|massive body]] from zero [[speed]] to some finite speed) relativistically – using [[Lorentz transformations]] instead of [[Newtonian mechanics]] – Einstein discovered an unexpected by-product of these calculations to be an energy term which does not vanish at zero speed. He called it [[rest energy]]: energy which every massive body must possess even when being at rest. The amount of energy is directly proportional to the mass of the body:

:&lt;math&gt; E_0 = m c^2 &lt;/math&gt;,
where
:''m'' is the mass of the body,
:''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum,
:''&lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt;'' is the rest energy.

For example, consider [[electron]]–[[positron]] annihilation, in which the rest energy of these two individual particles (equivalent to their [[invariant mass|rest mass]]) is converted to the radiant energy of the photons produced in the process. In this system the [[matter]] and [[antimatter]] (electrons and positrons) are destroyed and changed to non-matter (the photons). However, the total mass and total energy do not change during this interaction. The photons each have no rest mass but nonetheless have radiant energy which exhibits the same inertia as did the two original particles.  This is a reversible process – the inverse process is called [[pair creation]] – in which the rest mass of particles is created from the radiant energy of two (or more) annihilating photons.

In general relativity, the [[stress–energy tensor]] serves as the source term for the gravitational field, in rough analogy to the way mass serves as the source term in the non-relativistic Newtonian approximation.&lt;ref name="MTW"/&gt;

Energy and mass are manifestations of one and the same underlying physical property of a system.  This property is responsible for the inertia and strength of gravitational interaction of the system ("mass manifestations"), and is also responsible for the potential ability of the system to perform work or heating ("energy manifestations"), subject to the limitations of other physical laws.

In [[classical physics]], energy is a scalar quantity, the [[canonical conjugate]] to time. In [[special relativity]] energy is also a scalar (although not a [[Lorentz scalar]] but a time component of the [[energy–momentum 4-vector]]).&lt;ref name="MTW"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Misner, Thorne, Wheeler |title=Gravitation |year=1973 |publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=San Francisco |isbn=978-0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, energy is invariant with respect to rotations of [[space]], but not invariant with respect to rotations of [[space-time]] (= [[Lorentz boost|boosts]]).

==Transformation==
{{Main article|Energy transformation}}

{{Forms of energy transfer}}
[[File:Turbogenerator01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35| A [[turbo generator]] transforms the energy of pressurised steam into electrical energy]]
Energy may be [[energy transformation|transformed]] between different forms at various [[energy conversion efficiency|efficiencies]]. Items that transform between these forms are called [[transducer]]s. Examples of transducers include a battery, from [[chemical energy]] to [[electric energy]]; a dam: [[gravitational potential energy]] to [[kinetic energy]] of moving water (and the blades of a [[turbine]]) and ultimately to [[electric energy]] through an [[electric generator]]; or a [[heat engine]], from heat to work.

Examples of energy transformation include generating [[electric energy]] from heat energy via a steam turbine, or lifting an object against gravity using electrical energy driving a crane motor. Lifting against gravity performs mechanical work on the object and stores gravitational potential energy in the object. If the object falls to the ground, gravity does mechanical work on the object which transforms the potential energy in the gravitational field to the kinetic energy released as heat on impact with the ground. Our Sun transforms [[nuclear potential energy]] to other forms of energy; its total mass does not decrease due to that in itself (since it still contains the same total energy even if in different forms), but its mass does decrease when the energy escapes out to its surroundings, largely as [[radiant energy]].

There are strict limits to how efficiently heat can be converted into [[Work (physics)|work]] in a cyclic process, e.g. in a heat engine, as described by [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot's theorem]] and the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. However, some energy transformations can be quite efficient. The direction of transformations in energy (what kind of energy is transformed to what other kind) is often determined by [[entropy]] (equal energy spread among all available [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]) considerations. In practice all energy transformations are permitted on a small scale, but certain larger transformations are not permitted because it is statistically unlikely that energy or matter will randomly move into more concentrated forms or smaller spaces.

Energy transformations in the universe over time are characterized by various kinds of potential energy that has been available since the [[Big Bang]] later being "released" (transformed to more active types of energy such as kinetic or radiant energy) when a triggering mechanism is available. Familiar examples of such processes include nuclear decay, in which energy is released that was originally "stored" in heavy isotopes (such as [[uranium]] and [[thorium]]), by [[nucleosynthesis]], a process ultimately using the gravitational potential energy released from the [[gravitational collapse]] of [[supernova]]e, to store energy in the creation of these heavy elements before they were incorporated into the solar system and the Earth. This energy is triggered and released in nuclear [[fission bomb]]s or in civil nuclear power generation. Similarly, in the case of a [[Chemical explosive|chemical explosion]], [[chemical potential]] energy is transformed to [[kinetic energy]] and [[thermal energy]] in a very short time. Yet another example is that of a [[pendulum]]. At its highest points the [[kinetic energy]] is zero and the [[gravitational potential energy]] is at maximum. At its lowest point the [[kinetic energy]] is at maximum and is equal to the decrease of [[potential energy]]. If one (unrealistically) assumes that there is no [[friction]] or other losses, the conversion of energy between these processes would be perfect, and the [[pendulum]] would continue swinging forever.

Energy is also transferred from potential energy (&lt;math&gt;E_p&lt;/math&gt;) to kinetic energy (&lt;math&gt;E_k&lt;/math&gt;) and then back to potential energy constantly. This is referred to as conservation of energy. In this closed system, energy cannot be created or destroyed; therefore, the initial energy and the final energy will be equal to each other. This can be demonstrated by the following:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;E_{pi} + E_{ki} = E_{pF} + E_{kF}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

The equation can then be simplified further since &lt;math&gt;E_p = mgh&lt;/math&gt; (mass times acceleration due to gravity times the height) and &lt;math&gt;E_k = \frac{1}{2} mv^2&lt;/math&gt; (half&amp;nbsp;mass times velocity squared). Then the total amount of energy can be found by adding &lt;math&gt;E_p + E_k = E_{total}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Conservation of energy and mass in transformation===
Energy gives rise to weight when it is trapped in a system with zero momentum, where it can be weighed. It is also equivalent to mass, and this mass is always associated with it. Mass is also equivalent to a certain amount of energy, and likewise always appears associated with it, as described in [[mass-energy equivalence]]. The formula ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''², derived by [[Albert Einstein]] (1905) quantifies the relationship between rest-mass and rest-energy within the concept of special relativity. In different theoretical frameworks, similar formulas were derived by [[J.J. Thomson]] (1881), [[Henri Poincaré]] (1900), [[Friedrich Hasenöhrl]] (1904) and others (see [[Mass-energy equivalence#History]] for further information).

Part of the rest energy (equivalent to rest mass) of [[matter]] may be converted to other forms of energy (still exhibiting mass), but neither energy nor mass can be destroyed; rather, both remain constant during any process. However, since &lt;math&gt;c^2&lt;/math&gt; is extremely large relative to ordinary human scales, the conversion of an everyday amount of rest mass (for example, 1&amp;nbsp;kg) from rest energy to other forms of energy (such as kinetic energy, thermal energy, or the radiant energy carried by light and other radiation) can liberate tremendous amounts of energy (~&lt;math&gt;9\times 10^{16}&lt;/math&gt; joules = 21 megatons of TNT), as can be seen in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Conversely, the mass equivalent of an everyday amount energy is minuscule, which is why a loss of energy (loss of mass) from most systems is difficult to measure on a weighing scale, unless the energy loss is very large. Examples of large transformations between rest energy (of matter) and other forms of energy (e.g., kinetic energy into particles with rest mass) are found in [[nuclear physics]] and [[particle physics]].

===Reversible and non-reversible transformations===
Thermodynamics divides energy transformation into two kinds: [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible processes]] and [[irreversible process]]es. An irreversible process is one in which energy is dissipated (spread) into empty energy states available in a volume, from which it cannot be recovered into more concentrated forms (fewer quantum states), without degradation of even more energy. A reversible process is one in which this sort of dissipation does not happen. For example, conversion of energy from one type of potential field to another, is reversible, as in the pendulum system described above. In processes where heat is generated, quantum states of lower energy, present as possible excitations in fields between atoms, act as a reservoir for part of the energy, from which it cannot be recovered, in order to be converted with 100% efficiency into other forms of energy. In this case, the energy must partly stay as heat, and cannot be completely recovered as usable energy, except at the price of an increase in some other kind of heat-like increase in disorder in quantum states, in the universe (such as an expansion of matter, or a randomisation in a crystal).

As the universe evolves in time, more and more of its energy becomes trapped in irreversible states (i.e., as heat or other kinds of increases in disorder). This has been referred to as the inevitable thermodynamic [[heat death of the universe]]. In this heat death the energy of the universe does not change, but the fraction of energy which is available to do work through a [[heat engine]], or be transformed to other usable forms of energy (through the use of generators attached to heat engines), grows less and less.

==Conservation of energy==
{{Main article|Conservation of energy}}
The fact that energy can be neither created nor be destroyed is called the law of [[conservation of energy]].  In the form of the [[first law of thermodynamics]], this states that a [[closed system]]'s energy is constant unless energy is transferred in or out by [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] or [[heat]], and that no energy is lost in transfer. The total inflow of energy into a system must equal the total outflow of energy from the system, plus the change in the energy contained within the system. Whenever one measures (or calculates) the total energy of a system of particles whose interactions do not depend explicitly on time, it is found that the total energy of the system always remains constant.&lt;ref&gt;Berkeley Physics Course Volume 1. Charles Kittel, Walter D Knight and Malvin A Ruderman&lt;/ref&gt;

While heat can always be fully converted into work in a reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, for cyclic processes of practical interest in [[heat engine]]s the [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the system doing work always loses some energy as [[waste heat]]. This creates a limit to the amount of heat energy that can do work in a cyclic process, a limit called the [[available energy]]. Mechanical and other forms of energy can be transformed in the other direction into [[thermal energy]] without such limitations.&lt;ref name="thermo-laws"/&gt; The total energy of a system can be calculated by adding up all forms of energy in the system.

[[Richard Feynman]] said during a 1961 lecture:&lt;ref name="RPF1"/&gt;
{{quote|There is a fact, or if you wish, a ''law'', governing all natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law – it is exact so far as we know. The law is called the ''[[conservation of energy]]''. It states that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in manifold changes which nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a mathematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity which does not change when something happens. It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number and when we finish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same.|''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]''}}

Most kinds of energy (with gravitational energy being a notable exception)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~cwp/articles/noether.asg/noether.html |title=E. Noether's Discovery of the Deep Connection Between Symmetries and Conservation Laws |publisher=Physics.ucla.edu |date=1918-07-16 |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514080739/http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~cwp/articles/noether.asg/noether.html |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are subject to strict local conservation laws as well. In this case, energy can only be exchanged between adjacent regions of space, and all observers agree as to the volumetric density of energy in any given space. There is also a global law of conservation of energy, stating that the total energy of the universe cannot change; this is a corollary of the local law, but not vice versa.&lt;ref name="thermo-laws"&gt;[http://www.av8n.com/physics/thermo-laws.htm ''The Laws of Thermodynamics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215201900/http://www.av8n.com/physics/thermo-laws.htm |date=2006-12-15 }} including careful definitions of energy, free energy, et cetera.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RPF1"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Richard |last=Feynman|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics; Volume 1|year=1964|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=U.S.A| isbn=978-0-201-02115-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This law is a fundamental principle of physics. As shown rigorously by [[Noether's theorem]], the conservation of energy is a mathematical consequence of [[translational symmetry]] of time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/eecs20/week9/timeinvariance.html |title=Time Invariance |publisher=Ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717210455/http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/eecs20/week9/timeinvariance.html |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a property of most phenomena below the cosmic scale that makes them independent of their locations on the time coordinate. Put differently, yesterday, today, and tomorrow are physically indistinguishable. This is because energy is the quantity which is [[canonical conjugate]] to time. This mathematical entanglement of energy and time also results in the uncertainty principle - it is impossible to define the exact amount of energy during any definite time interval. The uncertainty principle should not be confused with energy conservation - rather it provides mathematical limits to which energy can in principle be defined and measured.

Each of the basic forces of nature is associated with a different type of potential energy, and all types of potential energy (like all other types of energy) appears as system [[mass]], whenever present. For example, a compressed spring will be slightly more massive than before it was compressed. Likewise, whenever energy is transferred between systems by any mechanism, an associated mass is transferred with it.

In [[quantum mechanics]] energy is expressed using the Hamiltonian [[Operator (physics)|operator]]. On any time scales, the uncertainty in the energy is by

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta E \Delta t \ge \frac { \hbar } {2 } &lt;/math&gt;

which is similar in form to the [[Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle]] (but not really mathematically equivalent thereto, since ''H'' and ''t'' are not dynamically conjugate variables, neither in classical nor in quantum mechanics).

In [[particle physics]], this inequality permits a qualitative understanding of [[virtual particles]] which carry [[momentum]], exchange by which and with real particles, is responsible for the creation of all known [[fundamental forces]] (more accurately known as [[fundamental interactions]]). [[Virtual photons]] (which are simply lowest quantum mechanical [[energy state]] of [[photon]]s) are also responsible for electrostatic interaction between [[electric charge]]s (which results in [[Coulomb law]]), for [[Spontaneous fission|spontaneous]] radiative decay of exited atomic and nuclear states, for the [[Casimir force]], for [[van der Waals force|van der Waals bond forces]] and some other observable phenomena.

==Energy transfer==
===Closed systems===
Energy transfer can be considered for the special case of systems which are [[closed system|closed]] to transfers of matter. The portion of the energy which is transferred by [[conservative force]]s over a distance is measured as the [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] the source system does on the receiving system. The portion of the energy which does not do work during the transfer is called [[heat]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Although heat is "wasted" energy for a specific energy transfer,(see: [[waste heat]]) it can often be harnessed to do useful work in subsequent interactions. However, the maximum energy that can be "recycled" from such recovery processes is limited by the [[second law of thermodynamics]].&lt;/ref&gt; Energy can be transferred between systems in a variety of ways. Examples include the transmission of [[electromagnetic energy]] via photons, physical collisions which transfer [[kinetic energy]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;The mechanism for most macroscopic physical collisions is actually [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]], but it is very common to simplify the interaction by ignoring the mechanism of collision and just calculate the beginning and end result.&lt;/ref&gt; and the conductive transfer of [[thermal energy]].

Energy is strictly conserved and is also locally conserved wherever it can be defined. In thermodynamics, for closed systems, the process of energy transfer is described by the [[first law of thermodynamics|first law]]:&lt;ref group=note&gt;There are several [[First law of thermodynamics#Description|sign conventions for this equation]]. Here, the signs in this equation follow the IUPAC convention.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta{}E = W + Q &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of energy transferred, &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; represents the work done on the system, and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; represents the heat flow into the system. As a simplification, the heat term, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, is sometimes ignored, especially when the [[thermal efficiency]] of the transfer is high.

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta{}E = W&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

This simplified equation is the one used to define the [[joule]], for example.

===Open systems===
Beyond the constraints of closed systems, [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|open systems]] can gain or lose energy in association with matter transfer (both of these process are illustrated by fueling an auto, a system which gains in energy thereby, without addition of either work or heat). Denoting this energy by &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, one may write

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta{}E = W + Q + E .&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

==Thermodynamics==

===Internal energy===
[[Internal energy]] is the sum of all microscopic forms of energy of a system. It is the energy needed to create the system. It is related to the potential energy, e.g., molecular structure, crystal structure, and other geometric aspects, as well as the motion of the particles, in form of kinetic energy. Thermodynamics is chiefly concerned with changes in internal energy and not its absolute value, which is impossible to determine with thermodynamics alone.&lt;ref name=klotz&gt;I. Klotz, R. Rosenberg, ''Chemical Thermodynamics - Basic Concepts and Methods'', 7th ed., Wiley (2008), p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

===First law of thermodynamics===
The [[first law of thermodynamics]] asserts that energy (but not necessarily [[thermodynamic free energy]]) is always conserved&lt;ref name="KK"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Kittel and Kroemer|title=Thermal Physics |year=1980|publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=New York| isbn=978-0-7167-1088-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that heat flow is a form of energy transfer. For homogeneous systems, with a well-defined temperature and pressure, a commonly used corollary of the first law is that, for a system subject only to [[pressure]] forces and heat transfer (e.g., a cylinder-full of gas) without chemical changes, the differential change in the internal energy of the system (with a ''gain'' in energy signified by a positive quantity) is given as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}E = T\mathrm{d}S - P\mathrm{d}V\,&lt;/math&gt;,

where the first term on the right is the heat transferred into the system, expressed in terms of [[temperature]] ''T'' and [[entropy]] ''S'' (in which entropy increases and the change d''S'' is positive when the system is heated), and the last term on the right hand side is identified as work done on the system, where pressure is ''P'' and volume ''V'' (the negative sign results since compression of the system requires work to be done on it and so the volume change, d''V'', is negative when work is done on the system).

This equation is highly specific, ignoring all chemical, electrical, nuclear, and gravitational forces, effects such as [[advection]] of any form of energy other than heat and pV-work. The general formulation of the first law (i.e., conservation of energy) is valid even in situations in which the system is not homogeneous. For these cases the change in internal energy of a ''closed'' system is expressed in a general form by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}E=\delta Q+\delta W&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta Q&lt;/math&gt; is the heat supplied to the system and &lt;math&gt;\delta W&lt;/math&gt; is the work applied to the system.

===Equipartition of energy===
The energy of a mechanical [[harmonic oscillator]] (a mass on a spring) is alternatively [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential]]. At two points in the oscillation [[Frequency|cycle]] it is entirely kinetic, and at two points it is entirely potential. Over the whole cycle, or over many cycles, net energy is thus equally split between kinetic and potential. This is called [[equipartition principle]]; total energy of a system with many degrees of freedom is equally split among all available degrees of freedom.

This principle is vitally important to understanding the behaviour of a quantity closely related to energy, called [[entropy]]. Entropy is a measure of evenness of a [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] of energy between parts of a system. When an isolated system is given more degrees of freedom (i.e., given new available [[energy state]]s that are the same as existing states), then total energy spreads over all available degrees equally without distinction between "new" and "old" degrees. This mathematical result is called the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. The second law of thermodynamics is valid only for systems which are near or in [[equilibrium state]]. For non-equilibrium systems, the laws governing system’s behavior are still debatable. One of the guiding principles for these systems is the principle of [[principle of maximum entropy|maximum entropy production]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Onsager|first1=L.|title=Reciprocal relations in irreversible processes.|journal=Phys.

An '''energy being''' or '''astral being''' is a theoretical [[life form]] that is composed of [[energy]] rather than [[matter]]. They appear in [[myth]]s/[[legend]]s, [[paranormal]]/[[UFO]] accounts, and in various works of [[speculative fiction]].

Energy beings are typically rendered as a translucent glowing fluid or as a collection of flames or electrical sparks or bolts; somewhat in common with the representations of [[ghost]]s.

Energy beings have a variety of capacities. The Taelons (from ''[[Earth: Final Conflict]]'') are barely more powerful than mortals, while others such as ''[[Star Trek]]''{{'}}s [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]], ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''{{'}}s Ascended Ancients/Ori, ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force]]''{{'}}s [[List of Ben 10 characters#Verdona Tennyson|Anodites]], or the Meekrob from ''[[Invader Zim]]'' possess god-like powers.

'''Energy brokers''' assist clients in procuring [[electric]] or [[natural gas]] from energy wholesalers/suppliers.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Since electricity and natural gas are commodities, prices change daily with the market.  It is challenging for most businesses without energy managers to obtain price comparisons from a variety of suppliers since prices must be compared on exactly the same day.  In addition, the terms of the particular contract offered by the supplier influences the price that is quoted.  An energy broker can provide a valuable service if they work with a large number of suppliers and can actually compile the sundry prices from suppliers.  An important aspect of this consulting role is to assure that the client understands the differences between the contract offers.  Under some State Laws they use the term "Suppliers" to refer to energy suppliers, brokers, and [[Smart Grid aggregator|aggregator]]s, however there are very important differences between them all.

Energy brokers do not own or distribute energy, nor are allowed to sell energy directly to you.  They simply present the rates of a wholesaler, or supplier.

==Product and services==
Energy consultants offer a lot more than procuring energy contracts from a supplier. In the UK and Europe where there is a lot of legislation and increasing pressure for businesses and countries to do more to reduce their energy consumption a lot of services from brokers now help ensure businesses meet a lot of compliance and accreditation requirements such as the ESOS (energy saving opportunity scheme), [[ISO 50001]], [[ISO 14001]], [[Energy Performance Certificate]]s and [[Display Energy Certificate]]s.
Other services include helping companies reduce energy consumption with the aim of meeting national and international carbon emission standards. Services include, energy health checks, energy audits, carbon zero, carbon offsetting and energy saving consulting.

Additional services such as arranging a [[power purchase agreement]], energy export contracts can be procured as well as energy monitoring and reporting technology and solutions are also offered by [[energy consultants]].

==Who do energy brokers serve?==
In the USA, energy brokers can serve residential, commercial and government entities that reside in energy deregulated states. In the [[UK]], and some countries in [[Europe]], the entire market is deregulated.

==Fees==
Energy brokers typically do not charge up front fees to provide rates.  If an entity purchases energy through a broker, the broker's fee is usually included in the rate the customer pays.    Some brokers will charge a fixed fee for their consulting services.

==Consulting==
{{main|Energy consulting}}
Not all energy brokers are consultants; However, the energy brokers who are also consultants will perform a more detailed analysis of a consumers' usage pattern in order to provide a custom rate, which typically results in more cost savings for the consumer.  Typically, they do not need any more information than that of an energy broker, because they can pull usage information from the local utility company.  There are some national energy brokers that use auditing teams to verify their client's invoices.&lt;ref name="DEC-guide"&gt;{{cite web |title=Improving the energy efficiency of our buildings – A guide to display energy certificates and advisory reports for public buildings |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/display-energy-certificates-and-advisory-reports-for-public-buildings |publisher=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |accessdate=19 September 2013 |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ. do uri = CELEX: 31998L0011: EN: NOT Directive 98/11 / EC of 27 January 1998 implementing Council Directive 92/75 / EEC with regard to energy labeling of household lamps].

'''Energy customer switching''' is a concept stemming from the [[Energy market|global energy markets]]. The concept refers to the action of one energy customer [[customer switching|switching]] [[energy supplier]], a switch is essentially seen as the free (by choice) movement of a customer. In addition to that a switch can include:

* A re-switch: When a customer switches for the second or subsequent time. 
* A switch-back: When a customer switches back to his/her former or previous supplier.

If a customer moves, there is often a switch, however this will only be counted if the customer is not dealing with the incumbent in the new area of residence.

The above is the official definition of switching and is being used by public energy institutions such as [[CEER]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceer.eu|title=Welcome - ceer.eu|website=www.ceer.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; [[ERGEG]] (forerunner to ACER&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acer.europa.eu/Pages/ACER.aspx|title=Home|website=www.acer.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The definition was originally developed by Dr Philip E. Lewis, international switching expert.

Switching is a key concept to understanding [[competition (economics)|competition]]-related issues on the global energy markets as the switching level of a concrete market reveals the state of the competition; High switching rates equals high level of competition and low switching rates equals limited competition. Thus measuring and assessing switching rates is necessary in order to have a correct impression of the energy markets. The action of switching is often done via a [[price comparison website]] or by the traditional [[door-to-door]] sales method, where a salesperson assists the customer in switching.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22527">'''Energy management''' includes planning and operation of [[energy production]] and [[energy consumption]] units. Objectives are [[Energy conservation|resource conservation]], [[climate protection]] and [[Saving|cost savings]], while the users have permanent access to the energy they need. It is connected closely to [[environmental management]], [[Manufacturing process management|production management]], [[logistics]] and other established business functions. The [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI-Guideline]] 4602 released a definition which includes the economic dimension: “Energy management is the proactive, organized and systematic coordination of procurement, [[Energy transformation|conversion]], [[Energy distribution|distribution]] and use of energy to meet the requirements, taking into account environmental and economic objectives”.&lt;ref&gt;VDI-Guideline VDI 4602, page 3, Beuth Verlag, Berlin 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency ==

===Base line of energy assessment===
One of initial steps for an effective energy cost control program is the base line energy assessment, which examines the pattern of existing energy usage by the government or any sub-entity of the government or private organization. This program will set the reference point for improvements in energy efficiency. Energy efficiency can improve the existing energy usage and benchmarking of every individual section such as area, sub-area and the industry etc .

== Organizational integration ==
It is important to integrate the energy management in the organizational structure, so that the energy management can be implemented. Responsibilities and the interaction of the decision makers should be regularized. The delegation of functions and competencies extend from the top management to the executive worker. Furthermore, a comprehensive [[wikt:coordination|coordination]] can ensure the fulfillment of the tasks.

It is advisable to establish a separate organizational unit “energy management” in large or energy-intensive companies. This unit supports the senior management and keeps track. It depends on the basic form of the [[organizational structure]], where this unit is connected. In case of a [[functional organization]] the unit is located directly between the first ([[CEO]]) and the second hierarchical level (corporate functions such as production, [[procurement]], [[marketing]]). In a divisional organization, there should be a central and several sector-specific energy management units. So the diverse needs of the individual [[Sector (economic)|sector]]s and the coordination between the branches and the head office can be fulfilled. In a [[matrix management|matrix organization]] the energy management can be included as a matrix function and thus approach most functions directly.

== Energy management in operational functions ==

=== Facility management ===
[[Facility management]] is an important part of energy management, because a huge proportion (average 25 per cent) of complete [[operating cost]]s are energy costs. According to the [[International Facility Management Association]] (IFMA), facility management is "a profession that encompasses multiple disciplines to ensure functionality of the built environment by integrating people, place, processes and technology."

The central task of energy management is to reduce costs for the provision of energy in buildings and facilities without compromising work processes. Especially the availability and service life of the equipment and the ease of use should remain the same. The German Facility Management Association (GEFMA e.V.) has published guidelines (e.g. GEFMA 124-1 and 124-2), which contain methods and ways of dealing with the integration of energy management in the context of a successful facility management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gefma.de/uploads/tx_ttproducts/datasheet/GEFMA124-1S1.2009-11.pdf|title=GEFMA: Energiemanagement Grundlagen und Leistungsbild|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this topic the facility manager has to deal with economic, ecological, risk-based and quality-based targets. He tries to minimize the total cost of the energy-related processes (supply, distribution and use).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy20.net/pi/index.php?StoryID=317&amp;articleID=154847 |title=viewed 10. November 2012 |publisher=Energy20.net |date=2010-02-03 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Passive house scheme 1.svg|thumb|300px|The '''Passivhaus''' uses a combination of [[:category:low-energy building|low-energy building]] techniques and technologies]]

The most important key figure in this context is [[kilowatt-hour]]s per square meter per year (kWh/m²a). Based on this key figure properties can be classified according to their energy consumption.

* Europe: In Germany a [[low-energy house]] can have a maximum energy consumption of 70 kWh/m²a.
*North America: In the [[United States]], the [[ENERGY STAR]] program is the largest program defining low-energy homes. Homes earning ENERGY STAR certification use at least 15% less energy than standard new homes built to the International Residential Code, although homes typically achieve 20%-30% savings.&lt;ref&gt;"Features of ENERGY STAR Qualified New Homes." - EnergyStar.gov, Retrieved 7 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, the [[Passive house]] (Passivhaus in German) ultra-low-energy standard, currently undergoing adoption in some other European countries, has a maximum space heating requirement of 15 kWh/m²a. A Passive House is a very well-insulated and virtually air-tight building. It does not require a conventional heating system. It is heated by solar gain and internal gains from people. Energy losses are minimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://passiv.de/en/02_informations/01_whatisapassivehouse/01_whatisapassivehouse.htm |title=retrieved 8 December 2012 |publisher=Passiv.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also buildings that produce more energy (for example by [[solar water heating]] or [[photovoltaic system]]s) over the course of a year than it imports from external sources. These buildings are called [[energy-plus-house]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plusenergiehaus.de/index.php?p=home&amp;pid=8&amp;L=0&amp;host=1#a1 |title=retrieved 3 December 2012 |publisher=Plusenergiehaus.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the work regulations manage competencies, roles and responsibilities. Because the systems also include risk factors (e.g., oil tanks, gas lines), you must ensure that all tasks are clearly described and distributed. A clear regulation can help to avoid liability risks.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung, p. 75 – 77, Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Logistics ===
[[File:A8 bei Derching LKW Richtung München MAN Mercedes.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Carriage of goods]]
Logistics is the [[management]] of the flow of [[resources]] between the point of origin and the point of destination in order to meet some requirements, for example of customers or corporations. Especially the core logistics task, transportation of the goods, can save costs and protect the environment through efficient energy management. The relevant factors are the choice of means of transportation, duration and length of transportation and cooperation with logistics service providers.

The logistics causes more than 14% percent of CO2 emissions worldwide. For this reason the term [[Green Logistics]] is becoming increasingly important.

Possible courses of action in terms of green logistics are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iml.fraunhofer.de/de/themengebiete/umwelt_ressourcenlogistik/umwelt_ressourcen/Green_Logistics.html |title=retrieved on November 10, 2012 |publisher=Iml.fraunhofer.de |date=2013-12-20 |accessdate=2013-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101010036/http://www.iml.fraunhofer.de/de/themengebiete/umwelt_ressourcenlogistik/umwelt_ressourcen/Green_Logistics.html |archivedate=2014-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Shift to ecofriendly transport carrier such as railroad and waterway
* Route and load optimization
* Formation of corporate networks, which are connected by logistics service
* Optimizing physical logistics processes by providing a sophisticated IT support

Besides transportation of goods, the transport of persons should be an important part of the logistic strategy of organizations. In case of business trips it is important to attract attention to the choice and the proportionality of the means of transport. It should be balanced whether a physical presence is mandatory or a telephone or video conference is just as useful. Home Office is another possibility in which the company can protect the environment indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p.103-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy procurement ===
Procurement is the acquisition of goods or services. Energy prices fluctuate constantly, which can significantly affect the energy bill of organizations. Therefore poor energy procurement decisions can be expensive. Organizations can control and reduce energy costs by taking a proactive and efficient approach to buying energy. Even a change of the energy source can be a profitable and eco-friendly alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energieagentur.nrw.de/unternehmen/energiebeschaffung-3699.asp |title=retrieved 10 November 2012 |publisher=Energieagentur.nrw.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production ===
Production is the act of creating output, a good or service which has value and contributes to the utility of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., Brown, L., and Adam, S. (2006) Marketing, 7th Ed. Pearson Education Australia/Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; This central process may differ depending on the industry. Industrial companies have facilities that require a lot of energy. Service companies, in turn, do not need many materials, their energy-related focus is mainly facility management or Green IT. Therefore the energy-related focus has to be identified first, then evaluated and optimize.

=== Production planning and control ===
Usually, production is the area with the largest energy consumption within an organization. Therefore also the production planning and control becomes very important. It deals with the operational, temporal, quantitative and spatial planning, control and management of all processes that are necessary in the production of goods and commodities. The "production planner" should plan the production processes so that they operate in an energy efficient way. For example, strong power consumer can be moved into the night time. Peaks should be avoided for the benefit of a unified [[load profile]].

The impending changes in the structure of energy production require an increasing demand for storage capacity. The Production planning and control has to deal with the problem of limited [[energy storage|storability of energy]]. In principle there is the possibility to store energy electrically, mechanically or chemically. Another trend-setting technology is lithium-based electrochemical storage, which can be used in electric vehicles or as an option to control the power grid. The German [[Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology]] realized the significance of this topic and established an initiative with the aim to promote technological breakthroughs and support the rapid introduction of new energy storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwi.de/English/Navigation/Press/press-releases,did=487632.html |title=retrieved 6 December 2012 |language=de |publisher=Bmwi.de |date=2012-04-24 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maintenance ===
Maintenance is the combination of all technical and administrative actions, including supervision actions, intended to retain an item in, or restore it to, a state in which it can perform a required function.&lt;ref&gt;British Standard Glossary of terms (3811:1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed maintenance is essential to support the energy management. Hereby power losses and cost increases can be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ps-consulting.de/industrie/IH-Energiemanagement.html |title=abgerufen am 12. November 2012 |publisher=Ps-consulting.de |date=2013-11-21 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy management challenge===
Through the energy efficiency it management is remain the key for the any industrial user across globe , to achieve  the energy management goal for the federal government or  industry  the efficiency of water and energy resources play a vital role

Examples of how it is possible to save energy and costs with the help of maintenance:

* Defrost the fridges
* Check the barometer of cars and trucks
* Insulation of hot systems
* Improve leaks in building envelopes

== Energy strategies ==
A long-term energy strategy should be part of the overall strategy of a company. This strategy may include the objective of increasing the use of renewable energies. Furthermore, criteria for decisions on energy investments, such as yield expectations, are determined.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kals, K. Würtenberger: IT-unterstütztes Energiemanagement in: HMD - Praxis der Wirtschaftsinformatik HMD, Heft 285/2012, S. 73-81.&lt;/ref&gt; By formulating an energy strategy companies have the opportunity to avoid risks and to assure a competitive advance against their business rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential energy strategies ===
According to Kals there are the following energy strategies:&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p. 182-184.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Passive Strategy: There is no systematic planning. The issue of energy and environmental management is not perceived as an independent field of action. The organization only deals with the most essential subjects.
* Strategy of short-term profit maximization: The management is concentrating exclusively on measures that have a relatively short [[payback period]] and a high return. Measures with low profitability are not considered.
* Strategy of long-term profit maximization: This strategy includes that you have a high knowledge of the energy price and technology development. The relevant measures (for example, [[heat exchanger]]s or [[power station]]s) can have durations of several decades. Moreover, these measures can help to improve the [[image]] and increase the [[motivation]] of the employees.
* Realization of all financially attractive energy measures: This strategy has the goal to implement all measures that have a positive return on investment.
* Maximum strategy: For the climate protection one is willing to change even the object of the company.

In reality, you usually find hybrid forms of different strategies.

=== Energy strategies of companies ===
Many companies are trying to promote its image and time protect the climate through a proactive and public energy strategy. [[General Motors]] (GM) strategy is based on continuous improvement. Furthermore they have six principles: e.g. restoring and preserving the environment, reducing waste and pollutants, educating the public about environmental conservation, collaboration for the development of environmental laws and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gm.com/vision/environment1/our_commitment.html |title=retrieved 21. December 2012 |publisher=Gm.com |date=2012-01-13 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nokia]] created its first climate strategy in 2006. The strategy tries to evaluate the energy consumption and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions of products and operations and sets reduction targets accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Global&amp;nbsp; Change country |url=http://www.nokia.com/global/about-nokia/people-and-planet/operations/operations/ |title=retrieved 22. December 2012 |publisher=Nokia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, their environmental efforts is based on four key issues: substance management, energy efficiency, recycling, promoting environmental sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Global&amp;nbsp; Change country |url=http://www.nokia.com/global/about-nokia/people-and-planet/strategy/strategy-and-reports/ |title=retrieved 22. December 2012 |publisher=Nokia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy strategy of [[Volkswagen]] (VW) is based on environmentally friendly products and a resource-efficient production according to the "Group Strategy 2018".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkswagenag.com/content/vwcorp/content/en/sustainability_and_responsibility/Model_of_Sustainable_Development/Strategy_2018.html |title=retrieved 22. December 2012. |publisher=Volkswagenag.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all locations of the Group are certified to the international standard ISO 14001 for environmental management systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volkswagen.de/de/Volkswagen/nachhaltigkeit/management_und_daten/management/umweltzertifikat.html retrieved 22. December 2012.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114083829/http://www.volkswagen.de/de/Volkswagen/nachhaltigkeit/management_und_daten/management/umweltzertifikat.html |date=November 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When looking at the energy strategies of companies it is important to you have the topic [[greenwashing]] in mind. This is a form of propaganda in which green strategies are used to promote the opinion that an organization's aims are environmentally friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenwashingindex.com/about-greenwashing/ |title=retrieved 16.01.2013 |publisher=Greenwashingindex.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy strategies of politics ===
Even many countries formulate energy strategies. The [[Swiss Federal Council]] decided in May 2011 to resign nuclear energy medium-dated. The nuclear power plants will be shut down at the end of life and will not be replaced. In Compensation they put the focus on energy efficiency, [[renewable energies]], [[fossil energy]] sources and the development of [[water power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00526/00527/index.html?lang=de |title=retrieved 14. December 2012 |publisher=Bfe.admin.ch |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]] has clear instructions for its members. The "20-20-20-targets" include, that the [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]] have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% below 1990 levels, increase energy efficiency by 20% and achieve a 20% share of renewable energy in total energy consumption by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwi.de/DE/Themen/Energie/Energiepolitik/europaeische-energiepolitik.html |title=retrieved 14. December 2012 |language=de |publisher=Bmwi.de |date=2012-07-04 |accessdate=2013-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101085821/http://www.bmwi.de/DE/Themen/Energie/Energiepolitik/europaeische-energiepolitik.html |archivedate=2014-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethical and normative basis of the energy strategies ===
The basis of every energy strategy is the [[corporate culture]] and the related ethical standards applying in the company.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kals, K. Würtenberger: IT-unterstütztes Energiemanagement in: HMD - Praxis der Wirtschaftsinformatik HMD, Heft 285/2012, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethics]], in the sense of [[business ethics]], examines ethical principles and moral or ethical issues that arise in a business environment. Ethical standards can appear in company guidelines, energy and environmental policies or other documents.

The most relevant ethical ideas for the energy management are:

* [[Utilitarianism]]: This form of ethics has the maxim that the one acts are good or right, whose consequences are optimal for the welfare of all those affected by the action (principle of maximum happiness). In terms of energy management, the existence of external costs should be considered. They do not directly affect those who profit from the economic activity but non-participants like future generations. This error in the market mechanism can be solved by the [[internalization]] of [[external cost]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Discourse ethics|Argumentation Ethics]]: This fundamental ethical idea says that everyone who is affected by the [[Decision making|decision]], must be involved in decision making. This is done in a fair [[dialogue]], the result is completely uncertain.&lt;ref name="odpowiedzialny6"&gt;Johannes Kals: Business Ethics and Corporate Energy Management, in: Karczewski, Leszek; Kretek, Henryk (eds): Odpowiedzialny biznes i konsumerysm wyzwaniem XXI Wieku (Responsible Business and Responsible Consumerism as a Challenge of the 21st Century), Polen, Raciborz 2012, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Deontological ethics]]: The deontological ethics assigns individuals and organizations certain obligations. A general example is the [[golden rule]]: "One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself." Therefore everyone should manage their duties and make an energy economic contribution.&lt;ref name="odpowiedzialny6"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7673">'''Energy Management Software''' ('''EMS''') is a general term and category referring to a variety of energy-related software &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mahmud|first1=Khizir|last2=Town|first2=Graham E.|title=A review of computer tools for modeling electric vehicle energy requirements and their impact on power distribution networks|journal=Applied Energy|date=June 2016|volume=172|pages=337–359|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.100}}&lt;/ref&gt; applications which may provide utility bill tracking, real-time metering, building HVAC and lighting control systems, building simulation and modeling, carbon and sustainability reporting, IT equipment management, [[demand response]], and/or energy audits. Managing energy can require a system of systems approach.&lt;ref&gt;Curry, Edward. 2012. [http://www.edwardcurry.org/publications/Curry_LinkedDataspaceForSOS_SOSE.pdf “System of Systems Information Interoperability Using a Linked Dataspace.”] In IEEE 7th International Conference on System of Systems Engineering (SOSE 2012), 101–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy management software often provides tools for reducing energy costs and consumption for buildings or communities. EMS collects energy data and uses it for three main purposes: Reporting, Monitoring and Engagement. Reporting may include verification of energy data, benchmarking, and setting high-level energy use reduction targets. Monitoring may include trend analysis and tracking [[energy consumption]] to identify cost-saving opportunities. Engagement can mean real-time responses (automated or manual), or the initiation of a dialogue between occupants and building managers to promote [[energy conservation]]. One engagement method that has recently gained popularity is the real-time energy consumption display available in web applications or an onsite energy dashboard/display.

==Data collection==
Energy Management Software collects historic and/or [[real-time data|real-time]] [[interval data]], with intervals varying from quarterly billing statements to minute-by-minute [[smart meter]] readings. The data are collected from interval meters, [[Building automation|Building Automation Systems (BAS)]], directly from utilities, directly from sensors on electrical circuits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SiteSage EMS architecture|url=https://powerhousedynamics.com/solutions/sitesage/#architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other sources. Past bills can be used to provide a comparison between pre- and post-EMS energy consumption.

Electricity and Natural Gas are the most common utilities measured, though systems may monitor steam, petroleum or other energy uses, water use, and even locally generated energy. Renewable energy sources have contributed to the spurred growth in EMS data collection markets.

==Reporting==
Reporting tools are targeted at owners and executives who want to automate energy and emissions auditing. Cost and consumption data from a number of buildings can be aggregated or compared with the software, saving time relative to manual reporting. EMS offers more detailed energy information than utility billing can provide; another advantage is that outside factors affecting energy use, such as weather or building occupancy, can be accounted for as part of the reporting process. This information can be used to prioritize energy savings initiatives and balance energy savings against energy-related capital expenditures.

Bill verification can be used to compare metered consumption against billed consumption. Bill analysis can also demonstrate the impact of different energy costs, for example by comparing electrical demand charges to consumption costs.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting can calculate direct or indirect [[Greenhouse gas emissions|GHG emissions]], which may be used for internal reporting or [[enterprise carbon accounting]].

==Monitoring==
Monitoring tools track and display real-time and historical data. Often, EMS includes various benchmarking tools, such as energy consumption per square foot, weather normalization or more advanced analysis using energy modeling algorithms to identify anomalous consumption. Seeing exactly when energy is used, combined with anomaly recognition, can allow Facility or Energy Managers to identify savings opportunities.

Initiatives such as demand shaving, replacement of malfunctioning equipment, retrofits of inefficient equipment, and removal of unnecessary loads can be discovered and coordinated using the EMS. For example, an unexpected energy spike at a specific time each day may indicate an improperly set or malfunctioning timer. These tools can also be used for Energy Monitoring and Targeting. EMS uses models to correct for variable factors such as weather when performing historical comparisons to verify the effect of conservation and efficiency initiatives.

EMS may offer alerts, via text or email messages, when consumption values exceed pre-defined thresholds based on consumption or cost. These thresholds may be set at absolute levels, or use an energy model to determine when consumption is abnormally high or low. More recently, smartphones and tablets are becoming mainstream platforms for EMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serious Energy Management Software uses Smartphones |url=http://www.seriousenergy.com/energy-management/software/sem.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619012549/http://www.seriousenergy.com:80/energy-management/software/sem.html |archivedate=2011-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Powerhouse Dynamics’ mobile app expands real-time facility ops and energy management capabilities|url=http://www.chainstoreage.com/article/powerhouse-dynamics-mobile-app-expands-real-time-facility-ops-and-energy-management-capabil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engagement==
Engagement can refer to automated or manual responses to collected and analyzed energy data. Building control systems can respond as readily to energy fluctuation as a heating system can respond to temperature variation. Demand spikes can trigger equipment power-down processes, with or without human intervention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echome.co.uk/renewable-energy-services/heating-and-lighting-controls/ "Building Automation and Control"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another objective of Engagement is to connect occupants’ daily choices with building energy consumption. By displaying real-time consumption information, occupants see the immediate impact of their actions. The software can be used to promote energy conservation initiatives, offer advice to the occupants, or provide a forum for feedback on sustainability initiatives.

People-driven energy conservation programs, such as those sponsored by Energy Education, can be highly effective in reducing energy use and cost. 

Letting occupants know their real-time consumption alone can be responsible for a 7% reduction in energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americancity.org/afteroil/entry/1136/ "The Prius Effect"] by [http://americancity.org/afteroil/entry/1136/ Elizabeth Dickinson]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy monitoring and targeting''' (M&amp;T) is an energy efficiency technique based on the standard [[management]] axiom stating that “you cannot manage what you cannot measure”. M&amp;T techniques provide [[Energy engineering|energy manager]]s with feedback on operating practices, results of energy management projects, and guidance on the level of energy use that is expected in a certain period. Importantly, they also give early warning of unexpected excess consumption caused by equipment malfunctions, operator error, unwanted user behaviours, lack of effective maintenance and the like.

The foundation of M&amp;T lies in determining the normal relationships of energy consumptions to relevant driving factors (HVAC equipment, production though puts, weather, occupancy available daylight, etc.) and the goal is to help business managers:

* Identify and explain excessive energy use
* Detect instances when consumption is unexpectedly higher or lower than would usually have been the case
* Visualize energy consumption trends (daily, weekly, seasonal, operational…)
* Determine future energy use and costs when planning changes in the business
* Diagnose specific areas of wasted energy
* Observe how changes to relevant driving factors impact energy efficiency
* Develop performance targets for energy management programs
* Manage energy consumption, rather than accept it as a fixed cost

The ultimate goal is to reduce energy costs through improved [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and energy management control. Other benefits generally include increased resource efficiency, improved [[production, costs, and pricing|production]] budgeting and reduction of [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions.

==History==
M&amp;T is an established technique that was first launched as a national program in the [[UK]] in 1980, and has since then spread throughout Europe. These techniques are now{{When|date=July 2014}} also rapidly growing in America.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Goals and benefits==
Throughout the numerous M&amp;T projects implemented since the 1980s, a certain number of benefits have proved to be recurrent:
* Energy cost savings: generally 5% of the original energy expenses, according to [[The Carbon Trust]]. Carbon Trust has conducted a study over 1000 [[Small Business|small businesses]] and has concluded that on average an organization could save 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advanced metering for SMEs |url=https://www.carbontrust.com/media/77244/ctc713_advanced_metering_for_smes.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209000820/https://www.carbontrust.com/media/77244/ctc713_advanced_metering_for_smes.pdf |archivedate=December 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reduction in [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions: lower energy consumption helps reduce emissions
* Financing: measured energy reductions help obtain [[grant (money)|grants]] for energy efficiency projects
* Improved product and service costing: [[Utility submeter|sub-metering]] allows the division of the energy bill between the different processes of an [[industry]], and can be calculated as a [[production cost]]
* Improved [[budgeting]]: M&amp;T techniques can help forecast energy expenses in the case of changes in the business, for example
* Waste avoidance: helps diagnose energy waste in any process.

=== Key principles ===
Monitoring and Targeting techniques rely on three main principles, which form a constant [[feedback]] cycle, therefore improving control of energy use.

Monitoring [[information]] of energy use, in order to establish a basis for energy management and explain [[deviation (statistics)|deviations]] from an established pattern. Its primary goal is to maintain said pattern, by providing all the necessary data on energy consumption, as well as certain [[driving factors]], as identified during preliminary investigation ([[production, costs, and pricing|production]], weather, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodengineeringmag.com/articles/90655-energy-management-crunching-the-numbers|title=Energy management: crunching the numbers|last=Labs|first=Wayne|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Food Engineering Magazine|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reporting====
The final principle is the one which enables ongoing control of energy use, achievement of targets and verification of savings: reports must be issued to the appropriate managers. This in turn allows [[decision-making]] and actions to be taken in order to achieve the targets, as well as confirmation or denial that the targets have been reached.

===Procedures===
Before the M&amp;T measures themselves are implemented, a few preparatory steps are necessary. First of all, key energy consumers on the site must be identified. Generally, most of the energy consumption is concentrated in a small number of processes, like heating, or certain [[machinery]]. This normally requires a certain survey of the [[building]] and the equipment to estimate their energy consumption level.

It is also necessary to assess what other [[measurements]] will be required to [[analysis|analyze]] the consumption appropriately. This data will be used to [[chart]] against the energy consumption: these are underlying factors which influence the consumption, often [[production, costs, and pricing|production]] (for industry processes) or exterior [[temperature]] (for heating processes), but may include many other variables.

Once all variables to be measured have been established, and the necessary meters installed, it is possible to initiate the M&amp;T procedures.

====Measure====
The first step is to compile the data from the different meters.  Low-cost energy feedback displays have become available. The frequency at which the data is compiled varies according to the desired reporting interval, but can go once every 30 seconds to once every 15 minutes. Some measurements can be taken directly from the meters, others must be calculated. These different measurements are often called streams or channels.

Driving factors such as production or [[degree day]]s also constitute streams and must be collected at intervals to match.

====Define the base-line====
The data compiled must then be plotted on a [[chart|graph]] in order to define the general consumption base-line. Consumption rates are plotted in a [[scatter plot]] against [[production, costs, and pricing|production]] or any other variable previously identified, and the [[best fit line]] is identified. This graph is the image of the business’ average energy performance, and conveys a lot of information:

* The [[y-intercept]] gives the minimal consumption in the absence of the variable (no [[production, costs, and pricing|production]], zero [[degree-day]]...). This is the base load of the system, the minimal consumption when it is not operating.
* The [[slope]] represents the relationship between the consumption and the previously identified [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]. This represents the efficiency of the process.
* The scatter is the degree of variability of the consumption with operational factors.
The [[slope]] is not used quite as often for M&amp;T purposes. However, a high [[y-intercept]] can mean that there is a fault in the process, causing it to use too much energy with no performance, unless there are specific distinctive features which lead to high base loads. Very scattered points, on the other hand, may reflect other significant factors playing in the variation of the energy consumption, other than the one plotted in the first place, but it can also be the illustration of a lack of control over the process.

====Monitor variations====
The next step is to monitor the difference between the expected consumption and the actual measured consumption. One of the tools most commonly used for this is the [[control chart|CUSUM]], which is the CUmulative SUM of differences. This consists in first calculating the difference between the expected and actual performances (the [[best fit line]] previously identified and the points themselves).

The [[CUSUM]] can then be plotted against time on a new [[chart|graph]], which then yields more information for the energy efficiency specialist. [[Variance]]s scattered around zero usually mean that the process is operating normally. Marked variations, increasing or decreasing steadily usually reflect a modification in the conditions of the process.

[[Image:CUSUM graph.jpg|right|Example of a CUSUM graph]]In the case of the [[control chart|CUSUM]] graph, the [[slope]] becomes very important, as it is the main indicator of the [[savings]] achieved. A [[slope]] going steadily down indicates steady [[savings]]. Any variation in the [[slope]] indicates a change in the process. For example, in the graph on the right, the first section indicated no [[savings]]. However, in September (beginning of the yellow line), an energy efficiency measure must have been implemented, as [[savings]] start to occur. The green line indicates an increase in the [[savings]] (as the [[slope]] is becoming steeper), whereas the red line must reflect a modification in the process having occurred in November, as [[savings]] have decreased slightly.

====Identify causes====
Energy efficiency specialists, in collaboration with building [[managers]], will decipher the [[control chart|CUSUM]] graph and identify the causes leading to variations in the consumption. This can be a change in [[behaviour]], a modification to the process, different exterior conditions, etc. These changes must be monitored and the causes identified in order to promote and enhance good behaviour, and discourage bad ones.

====Set targets====
Once the base line has been established, and causes for variations in energy consumption have been identified, it is time to set targets for the future. Now with all this information in hand, the targets are more realistic, as they are based on the building’s actual consumption.
Targeting consists in two main parts: the measure to which the consumption can be reduced, and the [[timeframe]] during which the compression will be achieved.

A good initial target is the [[best fit line]] identified during step 2. This line represents the [[average]] historical performance. Therefore, keeping all consumption below or equal to the historical average is an achievable target, yet remains a challenge as it involves eliminating high consumption peaks.

Some companies, as they improve their energy consumption, might even decide to bring their [[average]] performance down to their historical best. This is considered a much more challenging target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicenergy.com/live-energy-monitoring/building-energy-use/case-studies/|title=Building Energy Generation &amp; Usage|work=Case Studies|publisher=Logic Energy|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Monitor results====
This brings us back to step 1: measure consumption. One of the specificities of M&amp;T is that it is an ongoing process, requiring constant [[feedback]] in order to consistently improve performance. Once the targets are set and the desired measures are implemented, repeating the procedure from the start ensures that the managers are aware of the success or failure of the measures, and can then decide on further action.

===Examples===
An example with some features of an M&amp;T application is the [[ASU Campus Metabolism]], which provides real-time and historic energy use and generation data for facilities of [[Arizona State University]] on a public web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cm.asu.edu/|title=DGLux5 by DGLogik|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many utilities also offer customers electric interval data monitoring services. [[Xcel Energy]] is an example of an investor owned utility that offers its customer electric and natural gas monitoring services under the product name InfoWise from Xcel Energy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xcelenergy.com/infowise/|title=InfoWise from Xcel Energy - Xcel Energy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is administered by Power TakeOff,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.PowerTakeOff.com|title=PowerTakeOff – EMIS Behavioral Programming|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a third party partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xcelenergy.com/infowise/|title=InfoWise from Xcel Energy - Xcel Energy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Generic energy system supplying fuels and electricity.svg|thumb|300px|Physical components of a generic energy system supplying fuels and electricity (but not [[district heating|district heat]]) to end-users]]

An '''energy system''' is a system primarily designed to supply [[#Energy-services|energy-services]] to [[end user|end-users]].&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}  Taking a structural viewpoint, the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] defines an energy system as "all components related to the production, conversion, delivery, and use of energy".&lt;ref name="allwood-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|1261}}  The field of [[energy economics]] includes [[energy market]]s and treats an energy system as the technical and economic systems that satisfy [[consumer demand]] for energy in the forms of [[heat]], [[fuel]]s, and [[electricity]].&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}

The first two definitions allow for demand-side measures, including [[daylighting]], retrofitted [[building insulation]], and [[passive solar building design]], as well as socio-economic factors, such as aspects of [[energy demand management]] and even [[telecommuting]], while the third does not.  Neither does the third account for the [[Informal sector|informal economy]] in traditional [[biomass]] that is significant in many [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name="van-ruijven-etal-2008"/&gt;

The analysis of energy systems thus spans the disciplines of [[engineering]] and [[economics]].&lt;ref name="hoffman-and-wood-1976"/&gt;{{rp|1}}  Merging ideas from both areas to form a coherent description, particularly where [[macroeconomic]] dynamics are involved, is challenging.&lt;ref name="boehringer-and-rutherford-2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="herbst-etal-2012"/&gt;

The concept of an energy system is evolving as new regulations, technologies, and practices enter into service – for example, [[emissions trading]], the development of [[smart grid]]s, and the greater use of [[energy demand management]], respectively.

== Treatment ==

{{see also|Energy industry|Energy modeling}}
&lt;!-- {(see also|Energy industry|Energy modeling|Open energy system models}} --&gt;

From a structural perspective, an energy system is like any [[System|general system]] and is made up of a set of interacting component parts, located within an environment.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster-system"/&gt;  These components derive from ideas found in [[engineering]] and [[economics]].  Taking a process view, an energy system "consists of an integrated set of technical and economic activities operating within a complex societal framework".&lt;ref name="hoffman-and-wood-1976"/&gt;{{rp|423}}  The identification of the components and behaviors of an energy system depends on the circumstances, the purpose of the analysis, and the questions under investigation.  The concept of an energy system is therefore an [[Abstraction (software engineering)|abstraction]] which usually precedes some form of computer-based investigation, such as the construction and use of a suitable [[energy modeling|energy model]].&lt;ref name="anandarajah-etal-2009"/&gt;

Viewed in engineering terms, an energy system lends itself to representation as a [[flow network]]: the [[Glossary of graph theory#vertex|vertices]] map to engineering components like [[power station]]s and [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and the [[Glossary of graph theory#edge|edges]] map to the interfaces between these components.  This approach allows collections of similar or adjacent components to be aggregated and treated as one to simplify the model.  Once described thus, flow network algorithms, such as [[minimum-cost flow problem|minimum cost flow]], may be applied.&lt;ref name="quelhas-etal-2007"/&gt;  The components themselves can be treated as simple [[dynamical systems]] in their own right.&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;

Conversely, relatively pure economic modeling may adopt a sectorial approach with only limited engineering detail present.  The sector and sub-sector categories published by the [[International Energy Agency]] are often used as a basis for this analysis.  A 2009 study of the UK residential energy sector contrasts the use of the technology-rich [[Markal model]] with several UK sectoral housing stock models.&lt;ref name="kannan-and-strachan-2007"/&gt;

International [[statistical study of energy data|energy statistics]] are typically broken down by carrier, sector and sub-sector, and country.&lt;ref name="ires-2016"/&gt;  Energy carriers ({{abbr|aka|also known as}} energy products) are further classified as [[primary energy]] and [[primary energy#Conversion to energy carriers (or secondary energy)|secondary]] (or intermediate) energy and sometimes final (or end-use) energy.  Published energy datasets are normally adjusted so that they are internally consistent, meaning that all energy stocks and flows must [[Energy balance (energy economics)|balance]].  The IEA regularly publishes energy statistics and energy balances with varying levels of detail and cost and also offers mid-term projections based on this data.&lt;ref name="iea-2016a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iea-2016b"/&gt;  The notion of an energy carrier, as used in [[energy economics]], is distinct and different from the definition of [[energy]] used in physics.

Energy systems can range in scope, from local, municipal, national, and regional, to global, depending on issues under investigation.  Researchers may or may not include demand side measures within their definition of an energy system.  The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] does so, for instance, but covers these measures in separate chapters on transport, buildings, industry, and agriculture.{{efn|The IPCC chapter on agriculture is titled: Agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU).}}&lt;ref name="allwood-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|1261}}&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|516}}

Household consumption and investment decisions may also be included within the ambit of an energy system.  Such considerations are not common because consumer behavior is difficult to characterize, but the trend is to include human factors in models.  Household decision-taking may be represented using techniques from [[bounded rationality]] and [[Agent-based model|agent-based behavior]].&lt;ref name="wittmann-and-bruckner-2009"/&gt;  The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) specifically advocates that "more attention should be paid to incorporating behavioral considerations other than price- and income-driven behavior into economic models [of the energy system]".&lt;ref name="aaas-2011"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

== Energy-services ==

{{see also|Energy conservation|Efficient energy use}}

The concept of an energy-service is central, particularly when defining the purpose of an energy system:

{{quote|It is important to realize that the use of energy is no end in itself but is always directed to satisfy human needs and desires. Energy services are the ends for which the energy system provides the means.&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}}}

Energy-services can be defined as amenities that are either furnished through energy consumption or could have been thus supplied.&lt;ref name="morrison-etal-2005"/&gt;{{rp|2}}  More explicitly:

{{quote|Demand should, where possible, be defined in terms of energy-service provision, as characterized by an appropriate intensity{{efn|The term ''intensity'' refers to quantities which do not scale with component size.  See [[intensive and extensive properties]].}} – for example, air [[temperature]] in the case of space-heating or [[lux]] levels for [[illuminance]]. This approach facilitates a much greater set of potential responses to the question of supply, including the use of energetically-passive techniques – for instance, retrofitted [[Building insulation|insulation]] and [[daylighting]].&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2003"/&gt;{{rp|156}}}}

A consideration of energy-services per capita and how such services contribute to human welfare and individual quality of life is paramount to the debate on [[sustainable energy]].  People living in poor regions with low levels of energy-services consumption would clearly benefit from greater consumption, but the same is not generally true for those with high levels of consumption.&lt;ref name="haas-etal-2008"/&gt;

The notion of energy-services has given rise to [[energy service company|energy-service companies]] (ESCo) who contract to provide energy-services to a client for an extended period.  The ESCo is then free to choose the best means to do so, including investments in the thermal performance and [[HVAC]] equipment of the buildings in question.&lt;ref name="duplessis-etal-2012"/&gt;

== ISO 13600, 13601, 13602 on technical energy systems ==

ISO{{nnbsp}}13600, ISO{{nnbsp}}13601, and ISO{{nnbsp}}13602 form a set of [[international standard]]s covering technical energy systems (TES).&lt;ref name="iso-13600-1997-main"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13600-1997-corrigendum-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13601-1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13602-2002"/&gt;  Although withdrawn prior to 2016, these documents provide useful definitions and a framework for formalizing such systems.  The standards depict an energy system broken down into supply and demand sectors, linked by the flow of tradable energy commodities (or energywares).  Each sector has a set of inputs and outputs, some intentional and some harmful byproducts.  Sectors may be further divided into subsectors, each fulfilling a dedicated purpose.  The demand sector is ultimately present to supply energyware-based services to consumers (see [[#Energy-services|energy-services]]).

 | quote = The energy system consists of an integrated set of technical and economic activities operating within a complex societal framework.  Energy is a vital component in the economic and social well-being of a nation and must be considered explicitly in the formulation of regional, national, and international policy.  As the importance of energy in policy making has become apparent, research and analysis in the field of energy system modeling and forecasting has grown rapidly.  The field has evolved from one almost exclusively the domain of planning groups in the major sectors of the energy industry and of government regulatory agencies to one in which many Federal and State agencies are active in the development and application of energy models and forecasts.  Energy system models are now used extensively for regional, national and international forecasting and for policy formulation and analysis.

'''''Final Straw: Food, Earth, Happiness''''' is a documentary/art film released in June 2015 that takes audiences through farms and urban landscapes in [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], and the [[United States]], interviewing leading practitioners in the [[Natural farming|Natural Farming]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hong|first=Ryoseok|title=Final Straw: Food, Earth, Happiness|date=2000-01-01|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3709036/|last2=Kawaguchi|last3=Korn|first2=Yoshikazu|first3=Larry|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film began when an environmental artist (Patrick M. Lydon) and an environmental book editor (Suhee Kang), had a chance meeting in Seoul, South Korea, and began conducting short interviews together with leaders in the ecology and social justice movements. Upon meeting Korean farmer Seong Hyun Choi however, the two were so impressed by his ecological mindset and way of working, that they set out to produce a feature film about the movement. Lydon and Kang ended up quitting their jobs, giving away most of their possessions, and becoming voluntarily homeless for four years in order to afford producing the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kimchiandbasil.com/interview-final-straw/|title=Final straw: food, earth, happiness - Kimchi&amp;Basil|date=2016-02-20|work=Kimchi&amp;Basil|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/a-root-solution/|title=A ‘Root’ Solution {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/12/21/lydon-ghost-ship-raises-broad-questions-about-art-and-culture/|title=Lydon: Ghost Ship raises big questions about arts and culture|last=|first=|date=|website=San Jose Mercury News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is split into three sections 1) Modern Life, 2) Foundations and Mindset of Natural Farming, and 3) Natural Farming in Practice and Life. According to the filmmakers, as they began to understand more about how natural farming itself was not rooted in methods, but in a way of thinking, they chose to explore the life philosophies and ways of thinking of natural farming practitioners in a more free-flowing and artistic way, rather than an instructive one; the result is an unconventional documentary that features slow paced musical interludes alongside interviews. Reviewers have called both "meditative, and mindful," and "an inspiring call to action."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mindfulpie.com/one-straw-revolution/|title=Love nature, eat well – Mindful Pie|website=mindfulpie.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cleaneatingmag.com/|title=Eco Farming|last=|first=|date=July 1, 2015|work=Clean Eating Magazine|access-date=August 1, 2015|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=Active Interest Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and musician [[Alicia Bay Laurel]] called the film "both art and documentary".

== Production ==
Lydon and Kang spent what they call a "meager" life savings to make the film, along with the volunteer efforts of farmers, translators, writers, musicians they had met during their journey. Although the film was filmed, written, and edited entirely by the two directors, they readily admit that the process of making the film was co-operative effort, with more than 200 volunteers directly involved in the process in some way. The soundtrack was recorded with professional musicians from each of the three countries where filming took place, all of whom donated their time to contribute to the film project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/film-soundtrack-recording-with-windsync/|title=Film Soundtrack Recording with WindSync {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the continued help of international volunteers, the film is available in four languages (English, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese), and three more (Chinese, Portuguese, French) are in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cbjournalism.com/2016/03/24/filmmaker-spotlight-patrick-lydon-suhee-king/|title=Filmmaker Spotlight: Patrick Lydon &amp; Suhee King|date=2016-03-24|website=Chelsea Breaks the News|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/film-soundtrack-recording-with-windsync/|title=Film Soundtrack Recording with WindSync {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/the-documentary/|title=The Documentary {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tour and critical reception ==

Lydon and Suhee Kang host a 'mandala' workshop after a screening of their film in Seoul, South Korea.]]
Frustrated by the lack of distribution and film festival options for low- and no-budget films, the filmmakers made the decision to manage distribution and touring in the same way they went about filming, through co-operative effort. With the help of volunteers, independent theater owners, and community organizers, they launched an extensive tour throughout Japan and South Korea from 2015-2016, eventually screening the film at over 130 venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/tour-dates-and-screenings/|title=Tour Dates and Screenings {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than simply screening the film, the filmmakers decided to transition their existing media production organization ''SocieCity,'' into a vehicle for art and community engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artseverywhere.ca/2016/03/07/social-practice-artwork-a-restaurant-and-garden-serving-up-connections-to-urban-nature/|title=Social Practice Artwork: A Restaurant and Garden Serving up Connections to Urban Nature|last=|first=|date=|website=artseverywhere.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They made a point of hosting interactive events along with their screenings and in several cases, stayed in communities for up to three months at a time to build natural gardens and host a project they call REALtimeFOOD, a grown-to-order restaurant which connects the ideas from the film with real-world practices in farming, food, and crafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.naver.com/barndining_/220514125842|title=Bar&amp;Dining Magazine : 네이버 블로그|website=blog.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://setouchiexplorer.com/real-time-food-project-day-one-worlds-slowest-restaurant-opening/|title=REAL time FOOD Project - Day One - World's Slowest Restaurant Opening|date=2016-09-18|work=Setouchi Explorer|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, these efforts were funded by grants from local philanthropic organizations and/or supported by the communities themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chishimatochi.info/found/index.php/archives/service/1961|title=おおさか創造千島財団  » 2015年度|website=www.chishimatochi.info|language=ja|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sustainablepractice.org/2013/11/15/final-straw/|title=Final Straw|date=2013-11-15|website=The CSPA|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interested in the unconventional way the film was being made and toured, multiple magazines and newspapers in Japan and Korea followed the directors during several parts of their journey, notably ESSEN, Bar and Dining, and Road magazines, and Shikoku Shinbun and Huffington Post newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shikoku-newspaper-english.pdf|title=Connecting to Life with Natural Farming in Megijima|last=|first=|date=September 18, 2016|work=Shikoku Shinbun|access-date=17 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.kr/salimstory/story_b_8476176.html|title="모든 것이 연결되어 있다는 깨달음이 시작"|website=허핑턴포스트|language=ko-KR|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://navercast.naver.com/magazine_contents.nhn?rid=1095&amp;contents_id=45426|title=내일의 식문화를 일구는 사람들이 보내 온 새해 편지|access-date=2017-04-18|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the tour, the film was eventually picked up by festivals including Tassie Eco Film Festival and Belleville Doc Fest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://downtowndocfest.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Belleville%20Downtown%20DocFest%20Program_2016.pdf|title=Belleville International Documentary Festival - Official Program|last=|first=|date=1 February 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1805">A '''Gold universe''' is a [[cosmology|cosmological]] model of the [[universe]].  In these models, the universe starts with a [[Big Bang]] and expands for some time, with increasing [[entropy]] and a  [[thermodynamic]] [[arrow of time]] pointing in the direction of the expansion.  After the universe reaches a low-density state, it recontracts, but entropy now decreases, pointing the thermodynamic arrow of time in the opposite direction, until the universe ends in a low-entropy, high-density [[Big Crunch]]. 
There are two models of the universe which support the possibility of a reversed direction of time. The first begins with a state of low entropy at the Big Bang which continually increases until the Big Crunch. The second, a Gold Universe, posits that entropy will increase only until a moment of contraction, then gradually decrease. This latter model suggests the universe will become more orderly after the moment of contraction. The Gold model has been linked to the possibility of retrocausal change, questions concerning the preservation of information in a time-reversed universe (states of decreasing entropy), and [[Causality (physics)|causation]] in general.  The Gold Universe is named after the cosmologist [[Thomas Gold]], who proposed the model in the 1960s.

This more than 20-billion-year '''timeline of our universe''' shows the best estimates of major events from the universe's beginning to anticipated future events. Zero on the scale is the present day. A large step on the scale is one billion years; a small step, one hundred million years. The past is denoted by a minus sign: e.g., the oldest rock on Earth was formed about four billion years ago and this is marked at -4e+09 years, where 4e+09 represents 4 times 10 to the power of 9. The "[[Big Bang]]" event most likely happened 13.8 billion years ago; see [[age of the universe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18436">{{short description|A theoretical upper limit on the energy of cosmic ray protons}}
The '''Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit''' ('''GZK limit''') is a theoretical upper limit on the energy of [[cosmic ray]] [[proton]]s traveling from other galaxies through the intergalactic medium to our galaxy. The limit is {{val|5|e=19|ul=eV}}, or about 8&amp;nbsp;[[joule]]s. The limit is set by slowing-interactions of the protons with the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background radiation]] over long distances (~160 million light-years). The limit is at the same order of magnitude as the upper limit for energy at which cosmic rays have experimentally been detected. For example, one [[extreme-energy cosmic ray]] has been detected which appeared to possess a record {{val|3.12|e=20|u=eV}} (50 joules) of energy (about the same as the kinetic energy of a 35&amp;nbsp;mph baseball).

The GZK limit is derived under the assumption that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are protons. Measurements by the largest cosmic-ray observatory, the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]], suggest that most ultra-high energy cosmic rays are heavier elements.&lt;ref name="Aab2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aab|first1=Aexander|last2=others|title=Inferences on Mass Composition and Tests of Hadronic Interactions from 0.3 to 100 EeV using the water-Cherenkov Detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory|journal=Submitted to Phys. Rev. D|date=2017|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.07249.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the argument behind the GZK limit does not apply in the originally simple form and there is no fundamental contradiction in observing cosmic rays with energies that violate the limit.

In the past, the apparent violation of the GZK limit has inspired cosmologists and theoretical physicists to suggest other ways that circumvent the limit. These theories propose that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are produced nearby our galaxy or that [[Lorentz covariance]] is violated in such a way that protons do not lose energy on their way to our galaxy.

==Computation==
The limit was independently computed in 1966 by [[Kenneth Greisen]],&lt;ref name="Greisen1966"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greisen |first=Kenneth |authorlink= |date=1966 |title=End to the Cosmic-Ray Spectrum? |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=16 |issue=17 |pages=748&amp;ndash;750 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.16.748 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode=1966PhRvL..16..748G}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vadim Kuzmin (physicist)|Vadim Kuzmin]], and [[Georgiy Zatsepin]],&lt;ref name="Zatsepin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zatsepin |first=G. T. |last2=Kuz'min |first2=V. A. |date=1966 |title=Upper Limit of the Spectrum of Cosmic Rays |journal=Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics Letters |volume=4 |issue= |pages=78&amp;ndash;80 |bibcode=1966JETPL...4...78Z |url=http://www.jetpletters.ac.ru/ps/1624/article_24846.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on interactions between [[cosmic ray]]s and the photons of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB). They predicted that cosmic rays with energies over the threshold energy of {{val|5|e=19|ul=eV}} would interact with cosmic microwave background photons &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}&lt;/math&gt;, relatively [[blueshift]]ed by the speed of the cosmic rays, to produce [[pion]]s via the [[Delta baryon|&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; resonance]],

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}+p\rightarrow\Delta^+\rightarrow p + \pi^0,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}+p\rightarrow\Delta^+\rightarrow n + \pi^+.&lt;/math&gt;
Pions produced in this manner proceed to decay in the standard pion channels—ultimately to photons for neutral pions, and photons, positrons, and various neutrinos for positive pions. Neutrons decay also to similar products, so that ultimately the energy of any cosmic ray proton is drained off by production of high energy photons plus (in some cases) high energy electron/positron pairs and neutrino pairs.

The pion production process begins at a higher energy than ordinary electron-positron [[pair production]] (lepton production) from protons impacting the CMB, which starts at cosmic ray proton energies of only about {{val|e=17|ul=eV}}. However, pion production events drain 20% of the energy of a cosmic ray proton as compared with only 0.1% of its energy for electron positron pair production. This factor of 200 is from two sources: the pion has only about ~130 times the mass of the leptons, but the extra energy appears as different kinetic energies of the pion or leptons, and results in relatively more kinetic energy transferred to a heavier product pion, in order to conserve momentum. The much larger total energy losses from pion production result in the pion production process becoming the limiting one to high energy cosmic ray travel, rather than the lower-energy light-lepton production process.

The pion production process continues until the cosmic ray energy falls below the pion production threshold. Due to the mean path associated with this interaction, extragalactic cosmic rays traveling over distances larger than {{val|50|ul=Mpc}} ({{val|163|ul=Mly}}) and with energies greater than this threshold should never be observed on Earth. This distance is also known as GZK horizon.

==Cosmic ray paradox==
{{unsolved|physics|Why is it that some cosmic rays appear to possess [[energy|energies]] that are theoretically too high, given that there are no possible near-Earth sources, and that rays from distant sources should have scattered off the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]?}}

A number of observations have been made by the largest cosmic ray experiments [[Akeno Giant Air Shower Array]], [[High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector]], the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] and [[Telescope Array Project]] that appeared to show cosmic rays with energies above this limit (called [[extreme-energy cosmic ray]]s, or EECRs). The observation of these particles was the so-called '''GZK paradox''' or '''cosmic ray paradox'''.

These observations appear to contradict the predictions of [[special relativity]] and [[particle physics]] as they are presently understood. However, there are a number of possible explanations for these observations that may resolve this inconsistency.
*The observations could be due to an instrument error or an incorrect interpretation of the experiment, especially wrong energy assignment.
*The cosmic rays could have local sources well within the GZK horizon (although it is unclear what these sources could be).
*Cosmic rays are mostly heavier nuclei with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; nucleons. The energy per nucleon in a nucleus is by a factor &lt;math&gt;1/A&lt;/math&gt; lower, which correspondingly pushes the effective GZK limit for the whole nucleus up by a factor &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. For iron nuclei (the heaviest abundant element in cosmic rays), the corresponding energy limit for the whole nucleus is {{val|2.8|e=21|u=eV}}, which is well beyond the energies of detected ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.

Another suggestion involves ultra-high energy weakly interacting particles (for instance, [[neutrino]]s) which might be created at great distances and later react locally to give rise to the particles observed. In the proposed Z-burst model, an ultra-high energy cosmic neutrino collides with a relic anti-neutrino in our galaxy and annihilates to hadrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fargion |first1=D. |last2=Mele |first2=B. |last3=Salis |first3=A. |title=Ultra–High‐Energy Neutrino Scattering onto Relic Light Neutrinos in the Galactic Halo as a Possible Source of the Highest Energy Extragalactic Cosmic Rays |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=June 1999 |volume=517 |issue=2 |pages=725–733 |doi=10.1086/307203 |arxiv=astro-ph/9710029 |bibcode=1999ApJ...517..725F }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process proceeds via a (virtual) Z-boson:

&lt;math&gt;\nu + \bar{\nu}\rightarrow Z\rightarrow \text{hadrons}&lt;/math&gt;

The cross section for this process becomes large if the center of mass energy of the neutrino antineutrino pair is equal to the Z-boson mass (such a peak in the cross section is called "resonance"). Assuming that the relic anti-neutrino is at rest, the energy of the incident cosmic neutrino has to be:

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{m_{Z}^{2}}{2 m_{\nu}}= 4.2\times 10^{21} \left(\frac{\text{eV}}{m_{\nu}}\right)\text{eV}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the Z-boson and &lt;math&gt;m_{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; the mass of the neutrino.

===Other theories===
A number of exotic theories have been advanced to explain the AGASA observations, including [[doubly special relativity]]. However, it is now established that standard doubly special relativity does not predict any GZK suppression (or GZK cutoff), contrary to models of Lorentz symmetry violation involving an absolute rest frame.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Other possible theories involve [[Ultra-high-energy cosmic ray#Relation with dark matter|a relation with dark matter]], decays of exotic super-heavy particles beyond those known in the [[Standard Model]].

==Controversy about cosmic rays above the GZK limit==
A suppression of the cosmic ray flux which can be explained with the GZK limit has been confirmed by the latest generation of cosmic ray observatories. A former claim by the [[AGASA]] experiment that there is no suppression was overruled. It remains controversial, whether the suppression is due to the GZK effect. The GZK limit only applies if ultra-high energy cosmic rays are mostly protons.

In July 2007, during the 30th International Cosmic Ray Conference in Mérida, Yucatán, México, the [[High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector|High Resolution Fly's Eye Experiment]] (HiRes) and the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] (Auger) presented their results on ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. HiRes observed a suppression in the UHECR spectrum at just the right energy, observing only 13 events with an energy above the threshold, while expecting 43 with no suppression. This was interpreted as the first observation of the GZK limit.&lt;ref name="Abbasi2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abbasi |first=R. U. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2008 |title=First Observation of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin Suppression |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=100 |issue= 10|pages=101101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.101101 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=18352170 |arxiv=astro-ph/0703099 |bibcode=2008PhRvL.100j1101A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auger confirmed the flux suppression, but did not claim it to be the GZK limit: instead of the 30 events necessary to confirm the AGASA results, Auger saw only two, which are believed to be heavy nuclei events.&lt;ref name="Abraham2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abraham |first=J. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2008 | title=Observation of the suppression of the flux of cosmic rays above 4×10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; eV |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=101 |issue=6 |pages=061101–1–061101–7 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.061101 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |arxiv=0806.4302 |bibcode=2008PhRvL.101f1101A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flux suppression was previously brought into question when the AGASA experiment found no suppression in their spectrum{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. According to [[Alan Andrew Watson|Alan Watson]], spokesperson for the Auger Collaboration, AGASA results have been shown to be incorrect, possibly due to the systematic shift in energy assignment.

In 2010 and the following years, both the Pierre Auger Observatory and HiRes confirmed again a flux suppression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2010|title=Measurement of the energy spectrum of cosmic rays above {{val|e=18|u=eV}} using the Pierre Auger Observatory|url=|journal=Phys. Lett. B|volume=685|issue=4&amp;ndash;5|pages=239&amp;ndash;246|arxiv=1002.1975|bibcode=2010PhLB..685..239A|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2010.02.013|pmid=|quote=|author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1010.2690|author1=Sokolsky|author2=for the HiRes Collaboration|title=Final Results from the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) Experiment|class=astro-ph.HE|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in case of the Pierre Auger Observatory the effect is statistically significant at the level of 20 standard deviations.

After the flux suppression was established, a heated debate ensued whether cosmic rays that violate the GZK limit are protons. The Pierre Auger Observatory, the world's largest observatory, found with high statistical significance that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are not purely protons, but a mixture of elements which is getting heavier with increasing energy.&lt;ref name="Aab2017"/&gt;
The [[Telescope Array Project]], a joint effort from members of the HiRes and AGASA collaborations, agrees with the former HiRes result that these cosmic rays look like protons.&lt;ref name="Hanlon2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanlon|first1=William|last2=others|title=Telescope Array Composition Summary|journal=PoS|date=2017|volume=301|issue=536|url=https://pos.sissa.it/301/536/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim is based on data with lower statistical significance, however. The area covered by Telescope Array is about one third of the area covered by the Pierre Auger Observatory, and the latter has been running for a longer time.

The controversy was partially resolved in 2017, when a joint working group formed by members of both experiments presented a report at the 35th International Cosmic Ray Conference.&lt;ref name="deSouza2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Souza|first1=Vitor|last2=others|title=Testing the agreement between the Xmax distributions measured by the Pierre Auger and Telescope Array Observatories|journal=PoS|date=2017|volume=301|issue=522|url=https://pos.sissa.it/301/522/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the report, the raw experimental results are not in contradiction with each other. The different interpretations are mainly based on the use of different theoretical models (Telescope Array uses an outdated model for its interpretation), and the fact that Telescope Array has not collected enough events yet to distinguish the pure proton hypothesis from the mixed-nuclei hypothesis.

===Extreme Universe Space Observatory on Japanese Experiment Module (JEM-EUSO)===
[[Extreme Universe Space Observatory|EUSO]], which was scheduled to fly on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) in 2009, was designed to use the atmospheric-[[fluorescence]] technique to monitor a huge area and boost the statistics of UHECRs considerably. EUSO is to make a deep survey of UHECR-induced extensive air showers (EASs) from space, extending the measured energy spectrum well beyond the GZK-cutoff. It is to search for the origin of UHECRs, determine the nature of the origin of UHECRs, make an all-sky survey of the arrival direction of UHECRs, and seek to open the astronomical window on the extreme-energy universe with neutrinos. The fate of the EUSO Observatory is still unclear since NASA is considering early retirement of the ISS.

===The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope to resolve inconsistencies===
Launched in June 2008, the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] (formerly GLAST) will also provide data that will help resolve these inconsistencies.
*With the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, one has the possibility of detecting gamma rays from the freshly accelerated cosmic-ray nuclei at their acceleration site (the source of the UHECRs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ormes |first=Jonathan F. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2000 |title=The origin of cosmic rays: What can the Fermi Gamma-ray Telescope say? |journal=AIP Conference Proceedings |volume=528 |issue= |pages=445&amp;ndash;448 |id= |doi=10.1063/1.1324357 |quote= |arxiv=astro-ph/0003270}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*UHECR protons accelerated (see also [[Centrifugal mechanism of acceleration]]) in astrophysical objects produce ''secondary electromagnetic cascades'' during propagation in the cosmic microwave and infrared backgrounds, of which the GZK-process of pion production is one of the contributors. Such cascades can contribute between ≃1% and ≃50% of the GeV-TeV diffuse photon flux measured by the [[EGRET]] experiment. The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope may discover this flux.&lt;ref name="Kalashev2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kalashev |first=Oleg E. |authorlink= |author2=Semikoz, Dmitry V. |author3=Sigl, Guenter |date=2007 |title=Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays and the GeV-TeV Diffuse Gamma-Ray Flux |journal=Physical Review D |volume=79 |issue=6 |pages=063005 |arxiv=0704.2463 |bibcode=2009PhRvD..79f3005K|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.79.063005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible sources of UHECRs==
In November 2007, researchers at the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] announced that they had evidence that UHECRs appear to come from the [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] (AGNs) of energetic galaxies powered by matter swirling onto a supermassive black hole. The cosmic rays were detected and traced back to the AGNs using the [[Philippe Véron|Véron-Cetty-Véron]] catalog. These results are reported in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration |date=2007 |title=Correlation of the Highest-Energy Cosmic Rays with Nearby Extragalactic Objects |journal=Science |volume=318 |issue=5852 |pages=938&amp;ndash;943 |doi=10.1126/science.1151124 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |arxiv=0711.2256 |pmid=17991855 |bibcode = 2007Sci...318..938P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the strength of the correlation with AGNs from this particular catalog for the Auger data recorded after 2007 has been slowly diminishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration |date=2010 |title=Update on the correlation of the highest energy cosmic rays with nearby extragalactic matter |journal=Astropart.

'''Hardness''' is a measure of the resistance to localized plastic deformation induced by either mechanical indentation or abrasion. Some materials (e.g. [[Metal|metals]]) are harder than others (e.g. [[Plastic|plastics]], [[wood]]). Macroscopic hardness is generally characterized by strong [[intermolecular bond]]s, but the behavior of solid materials under force is complex; therefore, there are different measurements of hardness: ''scratch hardness'', ''indentation hardness'', and ''rebound hardness''.

Hardness is dependent on [[ductility]], [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] [[stiffness]], [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]], [[deformation (mechanics)|strain]], [[Strength of materials|strength]], [[toughness]], [[viscoelasticity]], and [[viscosity]].

Common examples of '''hard matter''' are [[ceramic]]s, [[concrete]], certain [[metal]]s, and [[superhard material]]s, which can be contrasted with [[soft matter]].

==Measuring hardness==
[[Image:Vickers-tester.jpg|thumb|A Vickers hardness tester]]

There are three main types of hardness measurements: ''scratch'', ''indentation'', and ''rebound''. Within each of these classes of measurement there are individual measurement scales. For practical reasons [[hardness comparison|conversion tables]] are used to convert between one scale and another.

===Scratch hardness{{Anchor|Scratch hardness}}===

{{main|Scratch hardness}}

Scratch hardness is the measure of how resistant a sample is to [[fracture]] or permanent [[plastic deformation]] due to friction from a sharp object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wredenberg|first=Fredrik|author2=PL Larsson|title=Scratch testing of metals and polymers: Experiments and numerics|journal=Wear|date=2009|doi=10.1016/j.wear.2008.05.014|volume=266|issue=1–2|pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is that an object made of a harder material will scratch an object made of a softer material. When testing coatings, scratch hardness refers to the force necessary to cut through the film to the substrate. The most common test is [[Mohs scale]], which is used in [[mineralogy]]. One tool to make this measurement is the [[sclerometer]].

Another tool used to make these tests is the pocket hardness tester. This tool consists of a scale arm with graduated markings attached to a four-wheeled carriage. A scratch tool with a sharp rim is mounted at a predetermined angle to the testing surface. In order to use it a weight of known mass is added to the scale arm at one of the graduated markings, the tool is then drawn across the test surface. The use of the weight and markings allows a known pressure to be applied without the need for complicated machinery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.byk.com/en/instruments/products/download.php?doc=74 Hoffman Scratch Hardness Tester] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323002752/https://www.byk.com/en/instruments/products/download.php?doc=74 |date=2014-03-23 }}. byk.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indentation hardness===
{{main|Indentation hardness}}

Indentation hardness measures the resistance of a sample to material deformation due to a constant compression load from a sharp object. Tests for indentation hardness are primarily used in [[engineering]] and [[metallurgy]] fields. The tests work on the basic premise of measuring the critical dimensions of an indentation left by a specifically dimensioned and loaded indenter.

Common indentation hardness scales are [[Rockwell scale|Rockwell]], [[Vickers hardness test|Vickers]], [[Shore scale|Shore]], and [[Brinell hardness test|Brinell]], amongst others.

===Rebound hardness===
Rebound hardness, also known as ''dynamic hardness'', measures the height of the "bounce" of a diamond-tipped hammer dropped from a fixed height onto a material. This type of hardness is related to [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]. The device used to take this measurement is known as a [[scleroscope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Allen | first = Robert | title = A guide to rebound hardness and scleroscope test | date = 2006-12-10 | url = http://www.articlestree.com/science/a-guide-to-rebound-hardness-and-scleroscope-test-tx301428.html | accessdate = 2008-09-08 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120718022923/http://www.articlestree.com/science/a-guide-to-rebound-hardness-and-scleroscope-test-tx301428.html | archivedate = 2012-07-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two scales that measures rebound hardness are the [[Leeb rebound hardness test]] and [[Bennett hardness scale]].

==Hardening==
{{Main|Hardening (metallurgy)}}

There are five hardening processes: [[Hall-Petch strengthening]], [[work hardening]], [[solid solution strengthening]], [[precipitation hardening]], and [[martensitic transformation]].

==Physics==
[[Image:stress-strain1.svg|thumb|Diagram of a [[stress-strain curve]], showing the relationship between [[Stress (physics)|stress]] (force applied per unit area) and [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] or [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] of a ductile metal.]]

In [[solid mechanics]], solids generally have three responses to [[force]], depending on the amount of force and the type of material:
* They exhibit [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]—the ability to temporarily change shape, but return to the original shape when the pressure is removed. "Hardness" in the elastic range—a small temporary change in shape for a given force—is known as [[stiffness]] in the case of a given object, or a high [[elastic modulus]] in the case of a material.
* They exhibit [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]]—the ability to permanently change shape in response to the force, but remain in one piece. The [[Yield (engineering)|yield strength]] is the point at which elastic deformation gives way to plastic deformation. Deformation in the plastic range is non-linear, and is described by the [[stress-strain curve]]. This response produces the observed properties of scratch and indentation hardness, as described and measured in materials science. Some materials exhibit both [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and [[viscosity]] when undergoing plastic deformation; this is called [[viscoelasticity]].
* They [[fracture]]—split into two or more pieces.

[[Strength of materials|Strength]] is a measure of the extent of a material's elastic range, or elastic and plastic ranges together. This is quantified as [[compressive strength]], [[shear strength]], [[tensile strength]] depending on the direction of the forces involved. [[Ultimate strength]] is an engineering measure of the maximum load a part of a specific material and geometry can withstand.

[[Brittleness]], in technical usage, is the tendency of a material to fracture with very little or no detectable plastic deformation beforehand. Thus in technical terms, a material can be both brittle and strong. In everyday usage "brittleness" usually refers to the tendency to fracture under a small amount of force, which exhibits both brittleness and a lack of strength (in the technical sense). For perfectly brittle materials, yield strength and ultimate strength are the same, because they do not experience detectable plastic deformation. The opposite of brittleness is [[ductility]].

The [[toughness]] of a material is the maximum amount of [[energy]] it can absorb before fracturing, which is different from the amount of [[force]] that can be applied. Toughness tends to be small for brittle materials, because elastic and plastic deformations allow materials to absorb large amounts of energy.

Hardness increases with decreasing [[particle size]]. This is known as the [[Hall-Petch relationship]]. However, below a critical grain-size, hardness decreases with decreasing grain size. This is known as the inverse Hall-Petch effect.

Hardness of a material to deformation is dependent on its microdurability or small-scale [[shear modulus]] in any direction, not to any [[Stiffness|rigidity]] or [[stiffness]] properties such as its [[bulk modulus]] or [[Young's modulus]]. Stiffness is often confused for hardness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Jeandron | first = Michelle | title = Diamonds are not forever | journal = Physics World | date = 2005-08-25 | url = http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/22997 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090215064216/http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/22997 | archivedate = 2009-02-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = San-Miguel | first = A. | last2 = Blase | first2 = P. | title = High Pressure Behavior of Silicon Clathrates: A New Class of Low Compressibility Materials | journal = Physical Review | volume = 83 | issue = 25 | date = 1999-05-19 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.5290 | pages = 5290 | last3 = Blase | first3 = X. | last4 = Mélinon | first4 = P. | last5 = Perez | first5 = A. | last6 = Itié | first6 = J. | last7 = Polian | first7 = A. | last8 = Reny | first8 = E. | last9 = Cros | first9 = C. | last10 = Pouchard | first10 = M. | bibcode=1999PhRvL..83.5290S| display-authors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some materials are stiffer than diamond (e.g. osmium) but are not harder, and are prone to [[spall]]ing and flaking in squamose or acicular habits.

===Mechanisms and theory===
[[Image:Close-packed spheres.jpg|thumb|A representation of the crystal lattice showing the planes of atoms.]]

The key to understanding the mechanism behind hardness is understanding the metallic [[microstructure]], or the structure and arrangement of the atoms at the atomic level. In fact, most important metallic properties critical to the manufacturing of today’s goods are determined by the microstructure of a material.&lt;ref name="Haasen"&gt;Haasen, P. (1978). Physical metallurgy. Cambridge [Eng.] ; New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; At the atomic level, the atoms in a metal are arranged in an orderly three-dimensional array called a [[crystal lattice]]. In reality, however, a given specimen of a metal likely never contains a consistent single crystal lattice. A given sample of metal will contain many grains, with each grain having a fairly consistent array pattern. At an even smaller scale, each grain contains irregularities.

There are two types of irregularities at the grain level of the microstructure that are responsible for the hardness of the material. These irregularities are point defects and line defects. A point defect is an irregularity located at a single lattice site inside of the overall three-dimensional lattice of the grain. There are three main point defects. If there is an atom missing from the array, a [[vacancy defect]] is formed. If there is a different type of atom at the lattice site that should normally be occupied by a metal atom, a substitutional defect is formed. If there exists an atom in a site where there should normally not be, an [[interstitial defect]] is formed. This is possible because space exists between atoms in a crystal lattice. While point defects are irregularities at a single site in the crystal lattice, line defects are irregularities on a plane of atoms. [[Dislocations]] are a type of line defect involving the misalignment of these planes. In the case of an edge dislocation, a half plane of atoms is wedged between two planes of atoms. In the case of a screw dislocation two planes of atoms are offset with a helical array running between them.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel, J. (2009). ''Introduction to materials science course manual''. Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin-Madison.&lt;/ref&gt;

In glasses, hardness seems to depend linearly on the number of topological constraints acting between the atoms of the network.&lt;ref name=mauro2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smedskjaer|first=Morten M.|author2=John C. Mauro |author3=Yuanzheng Yue |title=Prediction of Glass Hardness Using Temperature-Dependent Constraint Theory|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|year=2010|volume=105|issue=11|page=2010|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.115503|pmid=20867584|bibcode=2010PhRvL.105k5503S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the [[Rigidity theory (physics)|rigidity theory]] has allowed predicting hardness values with respect to composition.

[[Image:Dislocation edge d2.jpg|thumb|right|Planes of atoms split by an edge dislocation.]]

Dislocations provide a mechanism for planes of atoms to slip and thus a method for plastic or permanent deformation.&lt;ref name="Haasen" /&gt;  Planes of atoms can flip from one side of the dislocation to the other effectively allowing the dislocation to traverse through the material and the material to deform permanently. The movement allowed by these dislocations causes a decrease in the material's hardness.

The way to inhibit the movement of planes of atoms, and thus make them harder, involves the interaction of dislocations with each other and interstitial atoms. When a dislocation intersects with a second dislocation, it can no longer traverse through the crystal lattice. The intersection of dislocations creates an anchor point and does not allow the planes of atoms to continue to slip over one another&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, W. C. (1981). The physical metallurgy of steels. Washington: Hempisphere Pub. Corp., New York: McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0070377804}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A dislocation can also be anchored by the interaction with interstitial atoms. If a dislocation comes in contact with two or more interstitial atoms, the slip of the planes will again be disrupted. The interstitial atoms create anchor points, or pinning points, in the same manner as intersecting dislocations.

By varying the presence of interstitial atoms and the density of dislocations, a particular metal's hardness can be controlled. Although seemingly counter-intuitive, as the density of dislocations increases, there are more intersections created and consequently more anchor points. Similarly, as more interstitial atoms are added, more pinning points that impede the movements of dislocations are formed. As a result, the more anchor points added, the harder the material will become.

[[Andreas Cellarius]], German mathematician and cartographer (1596–1665), conceived an Atlas of the Universe, published in 1660, under the title of ''[[Harmonia Macrocosmica]]''. Numerous illustrations of the solar system appear in this atlas by different authors known at that time. Referring to Ptolemy, Cellarius called the representation of this Ptolemaic conception of heaven as "Imago universi secundum Ptolaeum"

''Imago'' is a word in [[Latin]] which means'' 'image''' or even "representation". Therefore, the title expresses the "Picture of the Universe according to Ptolemy." The Latin expression was used in the Middle Ages to express the representation and size of the known world at that time.

''Imago Universi'' is also the title, in Latin, of a [[cosmography|cosmographic]] treatise, written in 2013 by the Spanish scientist Gabriel Barceló.

After analyzing the history of cosmology, the treatise delves into the prevailing scientific lack of explanation of the rotation of the heavenly bodies in the laws of dynamic behaviour of the sidereal system. The author proposes the application of the [[Theory of Dynamic Interactions]] (TID) to astrophysics, in particular, the dynamics of stellar systems and galaxies. This theory allows new comprehension of the dynamics of nature and understands the dynamic equilibrium of the universe, always subjected to rotational accelerations, but repetitive and persistent. The author also highlights that the orbiting always coincides with the intrinsic rotation of celestial bodies. Paradox incorporating the book, noting that this had not been found to date.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5629">'''Infrasonic Passive Seismic Spectroscopy (IPSS)''' is a Passive Seismic Low Frequency technique used for mapping potential oil and gas hydrocarbon accumulations.

It is part of the geophysical techniques also known under the generic naming [[passive seismic]] which includes also the [[Seismic tomography|Passive Seismic Tomography]] and Micro Seismic Monitoring for petroleum, gas and geothermal applications. In a larger scale, Passive Seismic includes the [[IRIS Consortium|Global Seismic Network]] earthquakes monitoring (GSN).

Regarding petroleum and geothermal exploration (within a small scale), effect of fluid distribution on P- wave propagation in partially saturated rocks is the main responsible for the low frequency reservoir-related [http://www.pgexploration.com/resources/publications/ wavefield absorption].
 
The high level of attenuation, within the infrasonic bandwidth (below 10&amp;nbsp;Hz) of the seismic field observed in natural oil-saturated porous media during the last years (successfully explained by [https://books.google.it/books?id=_TkPCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=mesoscopic+homogeneous+seismic+models&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EJtCq_D0ip&amp;sig=uPNi3LY5j98O84W-7Sdntefr0sU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXuKqmqazXAhVPahoKHbHdBsAQ6AEIRjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=mesoscopic%20homogeneous%20seismic%20models&amp;f=false mesoscopic homogeneous models]) is the main responsible of the passive seismic wave field shifting within a low frequency range.
 
Pressure differences between regions with different fluid/solid properties induce frequency-dependency of the attenuation (Qp and Qs reservoir factors) and velocity dispersion (Vp, Vs) of the low frequency wave field.

Infrasonic Passive Seismic Spectroscopy techniques quantifies then the absorption and the wave field dispersion within the low frequency bandwidth giving the most predominant areas linked with possible oil-saturated and porous media.

The low frequency seismic field is not usually reachable by the active seismic surveys being either the explosive waves mainly in the high frequency and the vibroseis currently built not to reach such a low frequencies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2774">The '''ion vibration current''' ('''IVI''') and the associated '''ion vibration potential''' is an [[electric]] signal that arises when an [[acoustic wave]] propagates through a [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] fluid.

Historically, the IVI was the first known [[electroacoustic phenomena|electroacoustic phenomenon]]. It was predicted by [[Peter Debye]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Debye, P. |title=A method for the determination of the mass of electrolyte ions |journal=J. Chem. Phys. |volume=1 |page=13 |year=1933 |doi=10.1063/1.1749213|bibcode=1933JChPh...1...13D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a [[longitudinal wave|longitudinal]] [[sound wave]] travels through a solvent, the associated pressure gradients push the fluid particles back and forth, and it is easy in practice to create such accelerations that measure thousands or millions of [[g-force|g's]]. If a solute molecule is more dense or less dense than the surrounding liquid, then in this accelerating environment, the molecule will move relative to the surrounding liquid. This relative motion is essentially the same phenomenon that occurs in a [[centrifuge]], or more simply, it is essentially the same phenomenon that occurs when low-density objects float to the top of a glass of water, and high-density particles sink to the bottom (see the [[equivalence principle]], which states that gravity is just like any other acceleration). The amount of relative motion depends on the balance between the molecule's effective mass (which includes both the mass of the molecule itself and any solvent molecules that are so tightly bound to the molecule that they follow along with the molecule's motion), its effective volume (related to [[buoyant force]]), and the viscous drag (friction) between the molecule and the surrounding fluid.

IVI concerns the case where the particles in question are [[anion]]s and [[cation]]s. In general, they will have different amounts of motion relative to the fluid during the sound wave oscillations, and that discrepancy creates an alternating [[electric potential]] between various points in a [[sound wave]].

This effect was extensively used in the 1950s and 1960s for characterizing ion [[solvation]]. These works are mostly associated with the names of Zana and Yaeger, who published a review of their studies in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authors=Zana, R. and Yeager, E. |title=Ultrasonic Vibration Potentials |journal=Mod.

{{Cosmology|comp/struct}}
The '''ΛCDM''' ('''Lambda cold dark matter''') or '''Lambda-CDM''' model is a [[parametrization]] of the [[Big Bang]] [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] model in which the universe contains a [[cosmological constant]], denoted by [[Lambda]] ([[Greek alphabet|Greek]] '''Λ'''), associated with [[dark energy]], and [[cold dark matter]] (abbreviated '''CDM'''). It is frequently referred to as the '''standard model''' of Big Bang cosmology because it is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of the following properties of the cosmos:
* the existence and structure of the [[cosmic microwave background]]
* the [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|large-scale structure]] in the distribution of galaxies
* the [[abundance of the chemical elements|abundances]] of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|hydrogen (including deuterium), helium, and lithium]]
* the accelerating [[metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]] observed in the light from distant galaxies and [[supernova]]e

The model assumes that [[general relativity]] is the correct theory of gravity on cosmological scales.
It emerged in the late 1990s as a '''concordance cosmology''', after a period of time when disparate observed properties of the universe appeared mutually inconsistent, and there was no consensus on the makeup of the energy density of the universe.

The ΛCDM model can be extended by adding [[cosmological inflation]], [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] and other elements that are current areas of speculation and research in cosmology.

Some alternative models challenge the assumptions of the ΛCDM model. Examples of these are [[modified Newtonian dynamics]], modified gravity, theories of large-scale variations in the matter density of the universe, and scale invariance of empty space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maeder|first=Andre|date=2017|title=An Alternative to the ΛCDM Model: The Case of Scale Invariance|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0004-637X/834/i=2/a=194|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|language=en|volume=834|issue=2|pages=194|doi=10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/194|issn=0004-637X|arxiv=1701.03964|bibcode=2017ApJ...834..194M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pavel Kroupa|P. Kroupa]], B. Famaey, K.S. de Boer, J. Dabringhausen, M. Pawlowski, C.M. Boily, H. Jerjen, D. Forbes, G. Hensler, M. Metz, "Local-Group tests of dark-matter concordance cosmology. Towards a new paradigm for structure formation" [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010A%26A...523A..32K A&amp;A 523, 32 (2010).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Lambda-Cold Dark Matter, Accelerated Expansion of the Universe, Big Bang-Inflation.jpg|thumb|upright=2.4|Lambda-CDM, accelerated expansion of the universe. The time-line in this schematic diagram extends from the Big Bang/inflation era 13.7 Byr ago to the present cosmological time.]]
Most modern cosmological models are based on the [[cosmological principle]], which states that our observational location in the universe is not unusual or special; on a large-enough scale, the universe looks the same in all directions ([[isotropy]]) and from every location ([[homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]]).&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Liddle. ''An Introduction to Modern Cosmology (2nd ed.).'' London: Wiley, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The model includes an expansion of metric space that is well documented both as the [[red shift]] of prominent spectral absorption or emission lines in the light from distant galaxies and as the time dilation in the light decay of supernova luminosity curves. Both effects are attributed to a [[Doppler shift]] in electromagnetic radiation as it travels across expanding space. Although this expansion increases the distance between objects that are not under shared gravitational influence, it does not increase the size of the objects (e.g. galaxies) in space. It also allows for distant galaxies to recede from each other at speeds greater than the speed of light; local expansion is less than the speed of light, but expansion summed across great distances can collectively exceed the speed of light.

The letter &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; (lambda) represents the [[cosmological constant]], which is currently associated with a vacuum energy or [[dark energy]] in empty space that is used to explain the contemporary accelerating expansion of space against the attractive effects of gravity. A cosmological constant has negative pressure, &lt;math&gt; p = - \rho c^{2} &lt;/math&gt;, which contributes to the [[stress-energy tensor]] that, according to the general theory of relativity, causes accelerating expansion. The fraction of the total energy density of our (flat or almost flat) universe that is dark energy, &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{\Lambda}&lt;/math&gt;, is currently (2015) estimated to be 0.692 ± 0.012, or even 0.6911 ± 0.0062 based on [[Planck satellite]] data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/planck-upholds-standard-cosmology-0210201523/ Camille M. Carlisle, ''Planck Upholds Standard Cosmology'', Sky &amp; Telescope, February 10, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dark matter]] is postulated in order to account for gravitational effects observed in very large-scale structures (the "flat" [[rotation curve]]s of galaxies; the [[gravitational lens]]ing of light by galaxy clusters; and enhanced clustering of galaxies) that cannot be accounted for by the quantity of observed matter. [[Cold dark matter]] is ''non-[[baryon]]ic'', i.e. it consists of matter other than protons and neutrons (and electrons, by convention, although electrons are not baryons); ''cold'', i.e. its velocity is far less than the speed of light at the epoch of radiation-matter equality (thus neutrinos are excluded, being non-baryonic but not cold); ''dissipationless'', i.e. it cannot cool by radiating photons; and ''collisionless'', i.e. the dark matter particles interact with each other and other particles only through gravity and possibly the weak force. The dark matter component is currently (2013) estimated to constitute about 26.8% of the mass-energy density of the universe.

The remaining 4.9% (2013) comprises all ordinary matter observed as atoms, chemical elements, gas and plasma, the stuff of which visible planets, stars and galaxies are made. The great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is unseen, since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10% of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass-energy density of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Also, the energy density includes a very small fraction (~ 0.01%) in cosmic microwave background radiation, and not more than 0.5% in [[relic neutrinos]]. Although very small today, these were much more important in the distant past, dominating the matter at redshift &gt; 3200.

The model includes a single originating event, the "Big Bang", which was not an explosion but the abrupt appearance of expanding [[space-time]] containing radiation at temperatures of around 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; K. This was immediately (within 10&lt;sup&gt;−29&lt;/sup&gt; seconds) followed by an exponential expansion of space by a scale multiplier of 10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; or more, known as [[cosmic inflation]]. The early universe remained hot (above 10,000 K) for several hundred thousand years, a state that is detectable as a residual [[cosmic microwave background]], or CMB, a very low energy radiation emanating from all parts of the sky. The "Big Bang" scenario, with cosmic inflation and standard particle physics, is the only current cosmological model consistent with the observed continuing expansion of space, the observed distribution of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|lighter elements in the universe]] (hydrogen, helium, and lithium), and the spatial texture of minute irregularities ([[Anisotropy|anisotropies]]) in the CMB radiation. Cosmic inflation also addresses the "[[horizon problem]]" in the CMB; indeed, it seems likely that the universe is larger than the observable [[particle horizon]].

The model uses the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]], the [[Friedmann equations]] and the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|cosmological equations of state]] to describe the observable universe from right after the [[Timeline of the Big Bang#Inflationary epoch|inflationary epoch]] to present and future.

== Cosmic expansion history ==
The expansion of the universe is parametrized by a [[dimensionless]] [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] &lt;math&gt;a = a(t)&lt;/math&gt; (with time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; counted from the birth of the universe), defined relative to the present day, so &lt;math&gt;a_0 = a(t_0) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;; the usual convention in cosmology is that subscript 0 denotes present-day values, so &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the current age of the universe. The scale factor is related to the observed [[Redshift#Expansion of space|redshift]]&lt;ref name="Dodelson"/&gt; &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; of the light emitted at time &lt;math&gt;t_\mathrm{em}&lt;/math&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over a(t_\mathrm{em})} = 1 + z.&lt;/math&gt;
The expansion rate is described by the time-dependent [[Hubble parameter]], &lt;math&gt;H(t)&lt;/math&gt;, defined as
:&lt;math&gt;H(t) \equiv \frac{\dot a}{a},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\dot a&lt;/math&gt; is the time-derivative of the scale factor.  The first [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann equation]] gives the expansion rate in terms of the matter+radiation density {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;,}} the [[Curvature of the universe|curvature]] {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;,}} and the [[cosmological constant]] {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;,}}&lt;ref name="Dodelson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodelson|first1=Scott|title=Modern cosmology|date=2008|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|location=San Diego, CA [etc.]|isbn=978-0122191411|edition=4. [print.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H^2 = \left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \rho - \frac{kc^2}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3}, &lt;/math&gt;

where as usual {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;}} is the speed of light and {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;}} is the [[gravitational constant]]. 
A critical density &lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{crit}&lt;/math&gt; is the present-day density, which gives zero curvature &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, assuming the cosmological constant &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is zero, regardless of its actual value. Substituting these conditions to the Friedmann equation gives

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{crit} = \frac{3 H_0^2}{8 \pi G} = 1.878\;47(23) \times 10^{-26} \; h^2 \; \text{kg} \; \text{m}^{-3},&lt;/math&gt;{{refn|name=constants|{{cite web|url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2015/reviews/rpp2014-rev-astrophysical-constants.pdf |title=The Review of Particle Physics. 2.

where &lt;math&gt; h \equiv H_0 / (100 \; \mathrm{km \; s^{-1} \; Mpc^{-1}}) &lt;/math&gt; is the reduced Hubble constant.
If the cosmological constant were actually zero, the critical density would also mark the dividing line between eventual recollapse of the universe to a [[Big Crunch]], or unlimited expansion. For the Lambda-CDM model with a positive cosmological constant (as observed), the universe is predicted to expand forever regardless of whether the total density is slightly above or below the critical density; though other outcomes are possible in extended models where the [[dark energy]] is not constant but actually time-dependent.

It is standard to define the present-day '''density parameter''' &lt;math&gt;\Omega_x&lt;/math&gt; for various species as the dimensionless ratio
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_x \equiv \frac{\rho_x(t=t_0)}{\rho_\mathrm{crit} } = \frac{8 \pi G\rho_x(t=t_0)}{3 H_0^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where the subscript &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is one of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; for [[Baryon|baryons]], &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; for [[cold dark matter]], &lt;math&gt;rad&lt;/math&gt; for [[radiation]] ([[Photon|photons]] plus relativistic [[Neutrino|neutrinos]]), and &lt;math&gt;DE&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; for [[dark energy]].

Since the densities of various species scale as different powers of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, e.g. &lt;math&gt;a^{-3}&lt;/math&gt; for matter etc.,
the [[Friedmann equation]] can be conveniently rewritten in terms of the various density parameters as
:&lt;math&gt;H(a) \equiv \frac{\dot{a}}{a} = H_0 \sqrt{ (\Omega_c + \Omega_b) a^{-3} + \Omega_\text{rad} a^{-4} + \Omega_k a^{-2} + \Omega_{DE} a^{-3(1+w)} } &lt;/math&gt;
where w is the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] of dark energy, and assuming negligible neutrino mass (significant neutrino mass requires a more complex equation). The various &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; parameters add up to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; by construction.
In the general case this is integrated by computer to give
the expansion history &lt;math&gt;a(t)&lt;/math&gt; and also observable distance-redshift relations for any chosen values of the cosmological parameters, which can then be compared with observations such as [[supernovae]] and [[baryon acoustic oscillations]].

In the minimal 6-parameter Lambda-CDM model, it is assumed that curvature &lt;math&gt;\Omega_k&lt;/math&gt; is zero and &lt;math&gt; w = -1 &lt;/math&gt;, so this simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt; H(a) = H_0 \sqrt{ \Omega_m a^{-3} + \Omega_\text{rad} a^{-4} + \Omega_\Lambda } &lt;/math&gt;

Observations show that the radiation density is very small today, &lt;math&gt; \Omega_\text{rad} \sim 10^{-4} &lt;/math&gt;; if this term is neglected
the above has an analytic solution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frieman|first1=Joshua A.|last2=Turner|first2=Michael S.|last3=Huterer|first3=Dragan|title=Dark Energy and the Accelerating Universe|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|year=2008|volume=46|issue=1|pages=385–432|arxiv=0803.0982|doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.46.060407.145243|bibcode=2008ARA&amp;A..46..385F}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; a(t) = (\Omega_m / \Omega_\Lambda)^{1/3} \, \sinh^{2/3} ( t / t_\Lambda) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; t_\Lambda \equiv 2 / (3 H_0 \sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda} ) \ ; &lt;/math&gt;
this is fairly accurate for &lt;math&gt;a &gt; 0.01&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;t &gt; 10&lt;/math&gt;million years.
Solving for &lt;math&gt; a(t) = 1 &lt;/math&gt; gives the present age of the universe &lt;math&gt; t_0 &lt;/math&gt; in terms of the other parameters.

It follows that the transition from decelerating to accelerating expansion (the second derivative &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a} &lt;/math&gt; crossing zero) occurred when
:&lt;math&gt; a = ( \Omega_m / 2 \Omega_\Lambda )^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;

which evaluates to &lt;math&gt;a \sim 0.6&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;z \sim 0.66&lt;/math&gt; for the best-fit parameters estimated from the [[Planck spacecraft]].

==Historical development==
The discovery of the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] (CMB) in 1964 confirmed a key prediction of the [[Big Bang]] cosmology. From that point on, it was generally accepted that the universe started in a hot, dense state and has been expanding over time. The rate of expansion depends on the types of matter and energy present in the universe, and in particular, whether the total density is above or below the so-called critical density. During the 1970s, most attention focused on pure-baryonic models, but there were serious challenges explaining the formation of galaxies, given the small anisotropies in the CMB (upper limits at that time). In the early 1980s, it was realized that this could be resolved if cold dark matter dominated over the baryons, and the theory of [[cosmic inflation]] motivated models with critical density. During the 1980s, most research focused on cold dark matter with critical density in matter, around 95% CDM and 5% baryons: these showed success at forming galaxies and clusters of galaxies, but problems remained; notably, the model required a Hubble constant lower than preferred by observations, and observations around 1988-1990 showed more large-scale galaxy clustering than predicted. These difficulties sharpened with the discovery of CMB anisotropy by [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] in 1992, and several modified CDM models, including ΛCDM and mixed cold and hot dark matter, came under active consideration through the mid-1990s. The ΛCDM model then became the leading model following the observations of [[Accelerating universe|accelerating expansion]] in 1998, and was quickly supported by other observations: in 2000, the [[BOOMERanG]] microwave background experiment measured the total (matter–energy) density to be close to 100% of critical, whereas in 2001 the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dFGRS]] galaxy redshift survey measured the matter density to be near 25%; the large difference between these values supports a positive Λ or [[dark energy]]. Much more precise spacecraft measurements of the microwave background from [[WMAP]] in 2003 – 2010 and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] in 2013 - 2015 have continued to support the model and pin down the parameter values, most of which are now constrained below 1 percent uncertainty.

There is currently active research into many aspects of the ΛCDM model, both to refine the parameters and possibly detect deviations. In addition, ΛCDM has no explicit physical theory for the origin or physical nature of dark matter or dark energy; the nearly scale-invariant spectrum of the CMB perturbations, and their image across the celestial sphere, are believed to result from very small thermal and acoustic irregularities at the point of recombination. A large majority of astronomers and astrophysicists support the ΛCDM model or close relatives of it, but [[Mordehai Milgrom|Milgrom]], [[Stacy McGaugh|McGaugh]], and [[Pavel Kroupa|Kroupa]] are leading critics, attacking the dark matter portions of the theory from the perspective of [[galaxy formation]] models and supporting the alternative [[MOND]] theory, which requires a modification of the [[Einstein field equations]] and the [[Friedmann equations]] as seen in proposals such as [[MOG theory]] or [[Tensor–vector–scalar gravity|TeVeS theory]]. Other proposals by theoretical astrophysicists of cosmological alternatives to Einstein's general relativity that attempt to account for dark energy or dark matter include [[f(R) gravity]], [[Scalar–tensor theory|scalar–tensor theories]] such as [[galileon]] theories, [[brane cosmology|brane cosmologies]], the [[DGP model]], and [[massive gravity]] and its extensions such as [[bimetric theory|bimetric gravity]].

==Successes==
In addition to explaining pre-2000 observations,
the model has made a number of successful predictions: notably the existence of the
[[baryon acoustic oscillation]] feature, discovered in 2005 in the predicted location; and the statistics of weak [[gravitational lensing]], first observed in 2000 by several teams.

The six free parameters can be well constrained by the TT spectrum alone, and then the TE and EE spectra can be predicted theoretically to few-percent precision with no further adjustments allowed: comparison of theory and observations shows an excellent match.

==Challenges==
Extensive searches for dark matter particles have so far shown no well-agreed detection;
the dark energy may be almost impossible to detect in a laboratory, and its value is [[cosmological constant problem|unnaturally small]] compared to [[vacuum energy|naive theoretical predictions]].

Comparison of the model with observations is very successful on large scales (larger than galaxies, up to the observable horizon), but may have some problems on sub-galaxy scales, possibly predicting [[Dwarf galaxy problem|too many dwarf galaxies]] and too much dark matter in the innermost regions of galaxies. This problem is called the "small scale crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The simple ΛCDM model is based on six [[parameter]]s: physical baryon density parameter; physical dark matter density parameter; the age of the universe; scalar spectral index; curvature fluctuation amplitude; and reionization optical depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The dark side of the cosmology: dark matter and dark energy|author=Spergel, D.

(See below for extended models that allow these to vary.)

The values of these six parameters are mostly not predicted by current theory (though, ideally, they may be related by a future "[[Theory of Everything]]"), except that most versions of [[cosmic inflation]] predict the scalar spectral index should be slightly smaller than 1, consistent with the estimated value 0.96. The parameter values, and uncertainties, are estimated using large computer searches to locate the region of parameter space providing an acceptable match to cosmological observations. From these six parameters, the other model values, such as the [[Hubble's law|Hubble constant]] and the [[dark energy]] density, can be readily calculated.

Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the [[cosmic microwave background]] anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including the [[baryon acoustic oscillation]] feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, [[weak gravitational lensing]] and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less precisely measured at present.

==Missing baryon problem==
{{main article|Missing baryon problem}}
Massimo Persic and Paolo Salucci&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0502178.pdf The baryon content of the universe, M. Persic and P. Salucci, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; firstly estimated the baryonic density today present in ellipticals, spirals, groups and clusters of galaxies.
They performed an integration of the baryonic mass-to-light ratio over luminosity (in the following &lt;math display="inline"&gt;  M_b/L &lt;/math&gt;), weighted with the luminosity function &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\phi(L)&lt;/math&gt; over the previously mentioned classes of astrophysical objects: 

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_b = \sum \int L\phi(L) \frac{M_b}{L} \, dL.&lt;/math&gt;

The result was:

:&lt;math&gt; \Omega_b=\Omega_*+\Omega_\text{gas}=2.2\times10^{-3}+1.5\times10^{-3}h^{-1.3}\simeq0.003&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; h\simeq0.72 &lt;/math&gt;.

Note that this value is much lower than the prediction of standard cosmic nucleosynthesis &lt;math&gt; \Omega_b\simeq0.048 &lt;/math&gt;, so that stars and gas in galaxies and in galaxy groups and clusters account for less than 10% of the primordially synthesized baryons. This issue is known as the problem of the "missing baryons".

Extended models allow one or more of the "fixed" parameters above to vary, in addition to the basic six; so these models join smoothly to the basic six-parameter model in the limit that the additional parameter(s) approach the default values. For example, possible extensions of the simplest ΛCDM model allow for spatial curvature (&lt;math&gt;\Omega_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; may be different from 1); or [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] rather than a [[cosmological constant]] where the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] of dark energy is allowed to differ from −1. Cosmic inflation predicts tensor fluctuations ([[gravitational wave]]s). Their amplitude is parameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio (denoted &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;), which is determined by the unknown energy scale of inflation. Other modifications allow [[hot dark matter]] in the form of [[neutrino]]s more massive than the minimal value, or a running spectral index; the latter is generally not favoured by simple cosmic inflation models.

Allowing additional variable parameter(s) will generally ''increase'' the uncertainties in the standard six parameters quoted above, and may also shift the central values slightly. The Table below shows results for each of the possible "6+1" scenarios with one additional variable parameter; this indicates that, as of 2015, there is no convincing evidence that any additional parameter is different from its default value.

Some researchers have suggested that there is a running spectral index, but no statistically significant study has revealed one. Theoretical expectations suggest that the tensor-to-scalar ratio &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; should be between 0 and 0.3, and the latest results are now within those limits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5018">[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]
[[Image:Samuel Clarke.jpg|thumb|Samuel Clarke.]]
The '''Leibniz–Clarke correspondence''' was a [[scientific]], [[theological]] and [[philosophical]] [[debate]] conducted in an exchange of letters between the [[Germany|German]] thinker [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and [[Samuel Clarke]], an [[England|English]] supporter of [[Isaac Newton]] during the years 1715 and 1716.  The exchange began because of a letter Leibniz wrote to [[Caroline of Ansbach]], in which he remarked that Newtonian physics was detrimental to [[natural theology]].  Eager to defend the Newtonian view, Clarke responded, and the correspondence continued until the death of Leibniz in 1716.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a variety of subjects is touched on in the letters, the main interest for modern readers is in the dispute between the [[Absolute time and space|absolute]] theory of [[space]] favoured by Newton and Clarke, and Leibniz's [[Relational space|relational]] approach.  Also important is the conflict between Clarke's and Leibniz's opinions on [[free will]] and whether God must create the [[best of all possible worlds]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz had published only a book on moral matters, the ''[[Theodicy|Theodicée]]'' (1710), and his more metaphysical views had never been exposed to a sufficient extent, so the collected letters were met with interest by their contemporaries. The priority dispute between [[Leibniz and Newton calculus controversy|Leibniz and Newton about the calculus]] was still fresh in the public's mind and it was taken as a matter of course that it was Newton himself who stood behind Clarke's replies.

==Editions==
The Leibniz-Clarke letters were first published under Clarke's name in the year following Leibniz' death.&lt;ref&gt;''A Collection of Papers, which passed between the late Learned Mr. Leibniz, and Dr. Clarke, In the Years 1715 and 1716'', by Samuel Clarke D.D. (London:  James Knapton, 1717)&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a preface, took care of the translation from French, added notes and some of his own writing. In 1720 [[Pierre Desmaizeaux]] published a similar volume in a French translation,&lt;ref&gt;''Recueil de pièces diverses sur la philosophie la religion et l'histoire par Leibniz, Clarke et Newton'', publiées par Pierre Desmaizeaux, Amsterdam, 1720&lt;/ref&gt; including quotes from Newton's work. It is quite certain that for both editions the opinion of Newton himself has been sought and Leibniz left at a disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoloni-Melli D., ''Newton and the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence'',  The Cambridge Companion to Newton,   eds. I. B. Cohen and G. E. Smith, Cambridge University Press,  2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  However the German translation of the correspondence published by Kohler, also in 1720,&lt;ref&gt;''Merckwurdige Schriften welche . . . zwischen dem Herrn Baron von Leibniz und dem Herrn D. Clarke über besondere Materien der naturlichen Religion'' in Franzos. und Englischer Sprache gewechselt und . . . in teutscher Sprache herausgegeben worden von Heinrich Kohler, Frankfurt and Leipzig (Jena), 1720: there was a preface by [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] and a reply to Clarke's last letter in  behalf of Leibniz by Ludwig Philipp Thümmig; it appeared also in the latin translation from 1740.&lt;/ref&gt; contained a reply to Clarke's last letter which Leibniz had not been able to answer. The letters have been reprinted in most collections of Leibniz' works and regularly published in stand alone editions.&lt;ref&gt;A full list is given in Alexander H., ''The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence'',  with extracts from Newton's ''Principia'' and ''Opticks'', edited with an introduction and notes, Manchester, 1955 (and reeditions); for a more recent edition see e.g.

A '''material''' is a [[chemical substance]] or [[mixture]] of substances that constitute an object. Materials can be pure or impure, a singular composite or a complex mix, living or non-living matter, whether natural or man-made, either concrete or abstract. Materials can be classified based on different properties such as [[physical property|physical]] and [[chemical property|chemical properties]] (see [[List of materials properties]]), [[geological]], [[biological]], choreographical, or [[property (philosophy)|philosophical properties]]. In the physical sense, materials are studied in the field of [[materials science]].

In [[industry]], materials are inputs to [[wiktionary:production|production]] or [[list of manufacturing processes|manufacturing processes]]. They may either be [[raw material]], that is, unprocessed, or processed before being used in more advanced production processes, either by [[distillation]] or [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] (synthetic materials).

Types of materials include:
*[[Biomaterial]], of biological origin
*[[Composite material]], composed of multiple materials with differing physical properties
*[[Textile]]s, sometimes referred to as "material"
*[[Genetic material]]

==Classification of materials==
Materials are classified according to many different criteria including their physical and chemical characteristics as well as their intended applications whether it is thermal, optical, electrical, magnetic, or combined. As their methods of usage dictate their physical appearance, they can be designed, tailored, and/or prepared in many forms such as powders, thin or thick films, and plates and could be introduced/studied in a single or multi layers. End products could be pure materials or doped ones with most useful compounds are those with controlled added impurities.The dopants could be added chemically or mixed and implanted physically. In case the impurities were added chemically, the dopants/co-dopants on substitutional/interstitial sites should be optimized and investigated thoroughly as well as any stresses instigated by their presence within the structure; whereas in the case of the physical mixing, the influence of the degree of heterogeneity of the prepared hybrid composites ought to be studied.The different physical and chemical preparation techniques can be used solely or combined including solid state synthesis, hydrothermal, sol-gel, precipitations and coprecipitations, spin coating, physical vapor deposition, and spray pyrolysis. Types of impurities along with their amounts are usually dictated by types of matrices to be added to, and their ability to maximize the desired products’ usefulness. Among the most commonly used characterization techniques are X-ray diffraction (XRD) either single crystal or powder, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), UV-Vis absorption Spectroscopy, Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR), and Photoluminescence spectrometry. In addition, it is usually considered of extreme importance to find theoretical models that can confirm and/or predict the experimental findings and assist in discussion, assignment, and the explanation of results and outcomes. Also, vision and room for future modification and development should always be pinpointed. Hence, one can classify the material as a smart one if its presence can serve multi purposes within the final product.

{{quantum mechanics}}
'''Matter waves''' are a central part of the theory of [[quantum mechanics]], being an example of [[wave–particle duality]]. All [[matter]] can exhibit [[wave]]-like behavior. For example, a beam of [[electron]]s can be [[diffraction|diffracted]] just like a beam of light or a water wave. The concept that matter behaves like a wave was proposed by [[Louis de Broglie]] ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|b|r|ɔɪ}}) in 1924. It is also referred to as the ''de Broglie hypothesis''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Feynman|Feynman, R.]], ''[[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]]'', Penguin 1990 Edition, page 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Matter waves are referred to as ''de Broglie waves''.

The ''de Broglie wavelength'' is the [[wavelength]], {{math|''λ''}}, associated with a massive particle and is related to its [[momentum]], {{math|''p''}}, through the [[Planck constant]], {{math|''h''}}:
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{p}=\frac{h}{mv}.&lt;/math&gt;

Wave-like behavior of matter was first experimentally demonstrated by [[George Paget Thomson]]'s thin metal diffraction experiment,&lt;ref name=GPTdiff&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thomson, G. P. | title = Diffraction of Cathode Rays by a Thin Film | journal = Nature | volume = 119 | issue = 3007 | pages = 890 | year = 1927 | doi = 10.1038/119890a0 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v119/n3007/pdf/119890a0.pdf | format = PDF |bibcode = 1927Natur.119Q.890T }}&lt;/ref&gt; and independently in the [[Davisson–Germer experiment]] both using electrons, and it has also been confirmed for other [[elementary particle]]s, neutral [[atom]]s and even [[molecule]]s. Recently, it was also found that investigating the elementary process of diffusion gives the theoretical evidence of the relation of matter wave, regardless of the photon energy.&lt;ref&gt;Okino, T. (2018) Quantum Effect on Elementary Process of Diffusion and Collective Motion of Brown Particles, Journal Modern Physics 9, pp. 1007-1028.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus revealed that the relation of matter wave is now not a hypothesis but an actual equation relevant to a characteristic of micro particle. The wave-like behavior of matter is crucial to the modern theory of atomic  structure and [[particle physics]].

==Historical context==
At the end of the 19th century, light was thought to consist of waves of electromagnetic fields which propagated according to [[Maxwell's equations]], while matter was thought to consist of localized particles (See [[wave–particle duality#Brief history of wave and particle viewpoints|history of wave and particle viewpoints]]). In 1900, this division was exposed to doubt, when, investigating the theory of black body thermal radiation, [[Max Planck]] proposed that light is emitted in discrete quanta of energy. It was thoroughly challenged in 1905. Extending Planck's investigation in several ways, including its connection with the [[photoelectric effect]], [[Albert Einstein]] proposed that light is also propagated and absorbed in quanta. Light quanta are now called [[photon]]s. These quanta would have an energy given by the [[Planck–Einstein relation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;E=h\nu&lt;/math&gt;
and a momentum
:&lt;math&gt;p=\frac{E}{c}=\frac{h}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''ν''}} (lowercase [[Nu (letter)|Greek letter nu]]) and {{math|''λ''}} (lowercase [[Lambda|Greek letter lambda]]) denote the frequency and wavelength of the light, {{math|''c''}} the speed of light, and {{math|''h''}} the [[Planck constant]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein|Einstein, A.]] (1917). Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, ''Physicalische Zeitschrift'' '''18''': 121–128. Translated in {{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern convention, frequency is symbolized by ''f'' as is done in the rest of this article. Einstein’s postulate was confirmed experimentally by [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Robert Millikan]] and [[Arthur Compton]] over the next two decades.

==de Broglie hypothesis==
[[File:Propagation of a de broglie wave.svg|290px|"290px"|right|thumb|Propagation of '''de Broglie waves''' in 1d – real part of the [[complex number|complex]] amplitude is blue, imaginary part is green. The probability (shown as the color [[opacity (optics)|opacity]]) of finding the particle at a given point ''x'' is spread out like a waveform; there is no definite position of the particle. As the amplitude increases above zero the [[curvature]] decreases, so the amplitude decreases again, and vice versa. The result is an alternating amplitude: a wave. Top: [[plane wave]]. Bottom: [[wave packet]].]]
De Broglie, in his 1924 PhD thesis, proposed that just as light has both wave-like and particle-like properties, [[electron]]s also have wave-like properties. By rearranging the momentum equation stated in the above section, we find a relationship between the [[wavelength]], {{math|''λ''}} associated with an electron and its [[momentum]], {{math|''p''}}, through the [[Planck constant]], {{math|''h''}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{p}.&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship is now known to hold for all types of matter: all matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves.

{{quote|When I conceived the first basic ideas of wave mechanics in 1923–24, I was guided by the aim to perform a real physical synthesis, valid for all particles, of the coexistence of the wave and of the corpuscular aspects that Einstein had introduced for photons in his theory of light quanta in 1905.|De Broglie&lt;ref&gt;Louis de Broglie [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n170347gr6h82147/ "The Reinterpretation of Wave Mechanics" Foundations of Physics, Vol. 1 No. 1 (1970)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1926, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] published an [[Schrödinger equation|equation]] describing how a matter wave should evolve—the matter wave analogue of [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell’s equations]]—and used it to derive the [[Emission spectrum|energy spectrum]] of [[hydrogen]].

==Experimental confirmation==
[[File:Wave-particle duality.gif|right|thumb|200px|Demonstration of a matter wave in diffraction of electrons]]

Matter waves were first experimentally confirmed to occur in [[George Paget Thomson]]'s cathode ray diffraction experiment&lt;ref name=GPTdiff/&gt; and the [[Davisson–Germer experiment|Davisson-Germer experiment]] for electrons, and the de Broglie hypothesis has been confirmed for other elementary particles. Furthermore, neutral atoms and even molecules have been shown to be wave-like.

===Electrons===
{{further|Davisson–Germer experiment|Electron diffraction}}
In 1927 at Bell Labs, [[Clinton Davisson]] and [[Lester Germer]] [[Davisson–Germer experiment|fired]] slow-moving [[electron]]s at a [[crystal]]line [[nickel]] target. The angular dependence of the diffracted electron intensity was measured, and was determined to have the same [[diffraction|diffraction pattern]] as those predicted by [[William Lawrence Bragg|Bragg]] for [[x-ray]]s. At the same time George Paget Thomson at the University of Aberdeen was independently firing electrons at very thin metal foils to demonstrate the same effect.&lt;ref name=GPTdiff/&gt; Before the acceptance of the de Broglie hypothesis, diffraction was a property that was thought to be exhibited only by waves. Therefore, the presence of any [[diffraction]] effects by matter demonstrated the wave-like nature of matter. When the de Broglie wavelength was inserted into the [[Bragg's law|Bragg condition]], the observed diffraction pattern was predicted, thereby experimentally confirming the de Broglie hypothesis for electrons.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro Dardo, ''Nobel Laureates and Twentieth-Century Physics'', Cambridge University Press 2004, pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a pivotal result in the development of [[quantum mechanics]]. Just as the [[photoelectric effect]] demonstrated the particle nature of light, the [[Davisson–Germer experiment]] showed the wave-nature of matter, and completed the theory of [[wave–particle duality]]. For [[physicist]]s this idea was important because it meant that not only could any particle exhibit wave characteristics, but that one could use [[wave equation]]s to describe phenomena in matter if one used the de Broglie wavelength.

In each pair, the second equation is also referred to as the [[Planck–Einstein relation]], since it was also proposed by [[Max Planck|Planck]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]].

===Special relativity===
Using two formulas from [[special relativity]], one for the [[Momentum#Relativistic|relativistic momentum]] and one for the relativistic mass energy

:&lt;math&gt;E = m c^2 = \gamma m_0 c^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{p} = m\vec{v} = \gamma m_0 \vec{v} &lt;/math&gt;

allows the equations to be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}&amp;\lambda =\,\, \frac {h}{\gamma m_0v}\, =\, \frac {h}{m_0v}\,\,\,\, \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\\
&amp; f = \frac{\gamma\,m_0c^2}{h} = \frac {m_0c^2}{h} \bigg/ \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; denotes the particle's [[Invariant mass|rest mass]], &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; its [[velocity]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the [[Lorentz factor]], and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stationary states |first=Alan |last=Holden |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1971 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-501497-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, W.S.C. (2002). ''Introducing Special Relativity'', Taylor &amp; Francis, London, {{ISBN|0-415-27761-2}}, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Broglie, L. (1970). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n170347gr6h82147/ The reinterpretation of wave mechanics, ''Foundations of Physics'' '''1'''(1): 5–15, p. 9.]&lt;/ref&gt; See below for details of the derivation of the de Broglie relations. Group velocity (equal to the particle's speed) should not be confused with [[phase velocity]] (equal to the product of the particle's frequency and its wavelength). In the case of a non-[[dispersion relation|dispersive medium]], they happen to be equal, but otherwise they are not.

====Group velocity====
[[Albert Einstein]] first explained the [[wave–particle duality]] of light in 1905.  [[Louis de Broglie]] hypothesized that any particle should also exhibit such a duality. The velocity of a particle, he concluded, should always equal the group velocity of the corresponding wave. The magnitude of the group velocity is equal to the particle's speed.

Both in relativistic and non-relativistic quantum physics, we can identify the group velocity of a particle's wave function with the particle velocity.  [[Quantum mechanics]] has very accurately demonstrated this hypothesis, and the relation has been shown explicitly for particles as large as [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name="Arndt 680–682"/&gt;

De Broglie deduced that if the duality equations already known for light were the same for any particle, then his hypothesis would hold.  This means that

:&lt;math&gt;v_g = \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k} = \frac{\partial (E/\hbar)}{\partial (p/\hbar)} = \frac{\partial E}{\partial p}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''E''}} is the total [[energy]] of the particle, {{math|''p''}} is its [[momentum]], {{math|''ħ''}} is the reduced Planck constant. For a free non-relativistic particle it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \left( \frac{1}{2}\frac{p^2}{m} \right)\\
    &amp;= \frac{p}{m}\\
    &amp;= v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''}} is the [[mass]] of the particle and {{math|''v''}} its velocity.

Also in [[special relativity]] we find that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \left( \sqrt{p^2c^2+m_0^2c^4} \right)\\
    &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{\sqrt{p^2c^2 + m_0^2c^4}}\\
    &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{E}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the rest mass of the particle and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum. But (see below), using that the phase velocity is {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''E''/''p'' {{=}} ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''v''}}, therefore

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{E}\\
    &amp;= \frac{c^2}{v_p}\\
    &amp;= v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''v''}} is the velocity of the particle regardless of wave behavior.

====Phase velocity====
In [[quantum mechanics]], particles also behave as waves with [[complex number|complex]] phases. The [[phase velocity]] is equal to the product of the frequency multiplied by the wavelength.

By the de Broglie hypothesis, we see that

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{E/\hbar}{p/\hbar} = \frac{E}{p}. &lt;/math&gt;

Using [[special relativity|relativistic]] relations for energy and momentum, we have

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{E}{p} = \frac{m c^2}{m v} = \frac{\gamma m_0 c^2}{\gamma m_0 v} = \frac{c^2}{v} = \frac{c}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is the total energy of the particle (i.e. [[Invariant mass#Rest energy|rest energy]] plus [[kinetic energy]] in the [[Kinematics|kinematic]] sense), ''p'' the [[momentum]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the [[Lorentz factor]], ''c'' the [[speed of light]], and β the speed as a fraction of ''c''. The variable ''v'' can either be taken to be the speed of the particle or the group velocity of the corresponding matter wave. Since the particle speed &lt;math&gt;v &lt; c &lt;/math&gt; for any particle that has mass (according to [[special relativity]]), the phase velocity of matter waves always exceeds ''c'', i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} &gt; c, \,&lt;/math&gt;

and as we can see, it approaches ''c'' when the particle speed is in the relativistic range. The [[Faster-than-light|superluminal]] phase velocity does not violate special relativity, because phase propagation carries no energy. See the article on ''[[Dispersion (optics)#Group and phase velocity|Dispersion (optics)]]'' for details.

===Four-vectors===
{{Main|Four-vector}}

Using four-vectors, the De Broglie relations form a single equation:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}= \hbar\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt;

which is [[Inertial frame of reference|frame]]-independent.

Likewise, the relation between group/particle velocity and phase velocity is given in frame-independent form by:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega_o}{c^2}\right)\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:[[Four-momentum]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = \left(\frac{E}{c}, \vec{\mathbf{p}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:[[Four-vector#Four-wavevector|Four-wavevector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}, \vec{\mathbf{k}} \right) = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}, \frac{\omega}{v_p}\mathbf{\hat{n}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:[[Four-velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U} = \gamma(c,\vec{\mathbf{u}}) = \gamma(c,v_g \hat{\mathbf{n}}) &lt;/math&gt;

==Interpretations==
The physical reality underlying de Broglie waves is a subject of ongoing debate. Some theories treat either the particle or the wave aspect as its fundamental nature, seeking to explain the other as an [[Emergence|emergent property]]. Some, such as the [[hidden variable theory]], treat the wave and the particle as distinct entities. Yet others propose some intermediate entity that is neither quite wave nor quite particle but only appears as such when we measure one or the other property. The [[Copenhagen interpretation]] states that the nature of the underlying reality is unknowable and beyond the bounds of scientific inquiry.

Schrödinger's quantum mechanical waves are conceptually different from ordinary physical waves such as water or sound. Ordinary physical waves are characterized by undulating real-number 'displacements' of dimensioned physical variables at each point of ordinary physical space at each instant of time. Schrödinger's "waves" are characterized by the undulating value of a dimensionless complex number at each point of an abstract multi-dimensional space, for example of configuration space.

At the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927, [[Max Born]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] reported as follows:

{{quote|If one wishes to calculate the probabilities of excitation and ionization of atoms [M. Born, Zur Quantenmechanik der Stossvorgange, ''Z. f. Phys.'', '''37''' (1926), 863; [Quantenmechanik der Stossvorgange], ''ibid.'', '''38''' (1926), 803] then one must introduce the coordinates of the atomic electrons as variables on an equal footing with those of the colliding electron. The waves then propagate no longer in three-dimensional space but in multi-dimensional configuration space. From this one sees that the quantum mechanical waves are indeed something quite different from the light waves of the classical theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1928). Quantum mechanics, pp. 143–181 of ''Électrons et Photons: Rapports et Discussions du Cinquième Conseil de Physique, tenu à Bruxelles du 24 au 29 Octobre 1927, sous les Auspices de l'Institut International de Physique Solvay'', Gauthier-Villars, Paris, p. 166; this translation at p. 425 of Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009), ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the same conference, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] reported likewise.

{{quote|Under [the name 'wave mechanics',] at present two theories are being carried on, which are indeed closely related but not identical. The first, which follows on directly from the famous doctoral thesis by L. de Broglie, concerns waves in three-dimensional space. Because of the strictly relativistic treatment that is adopted in this version from the outset, we shall refer to it as the ''four-dimensional'' wave mechanics. The other theory is more remote from Mr de Broglie's original ideas, insofar as it is based on a wave-like process in the space of ''position coordinates'' (''q''-space) of an arbitrary mechanical system.[Long footnote about manuscript not copied here.] We shall therefore call it the ''multi-dimensional'' wave mechanics. Of course this use of the ''q''-space is to be seen only as a mathematical tool, as it is often applied also in the old mechanics; ultimately, in this version also, the process to be described is one in space and time. In truth, however, a complete unification of the two conceptions has not yet been achieved. Anything over and above the motion of a single electron could be treated so far only in the ''multi''-dimensional version; also, this is the  one that provides the mathematical solution to the problems posed by the Heisenberg-Born matrix mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger, E.]] (1928). Wave mechanics, pp. 185–206 of ''Électrons et Photons: Rapports et Discussions du Cinquième Conseil de Physique, tenu à Bruxelles du 24 au 29 Octobre 1927, sous les Auspices de l'Institut International de Physique Solvay'', Gauthier-Villars, Paris, pp. 185–186; this translation at p. 447 of Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009), ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1955, Heisenberg reiterated this:

{{quote|An important step forward was made by the work of Born [''Z. Phys.'', '''37''': 863, 1926 and '''38''': 803, 1926] in the summer of 1926. In this work, the wave in configuration space was interpreted as a probability wave, in order to explain collision processes on Schrödinger's theory. This hypothesis contained two important new features in comparison with that of [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]], [[Hans Kramers|Kramers]] and [[John C. Slater|Slater]]. The first of these was the assertion that, in considering "probability waves", we are concerned with processes not in ordinary three-dimensional space, but in an abstract configuration space (a fact which is, unfortunately, sometimes overlooked even today); the second was the recognition that the probability wave is related to an individual process.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1955). The development of the interpretation of the quantum theory, pp. 12–29, in ''[[Niels Bohr]] and the Development of Physics: Essays dedicated to Niels Bohr on the occasion of his seventieth birthday'', edited by [[Wolfgang Pauli|W. Pauli]], with the assistance of [[Léon Rosenfeld|L. Rosenfeld]] and [[Victor Weisskopf|V. Weisskopf]], Pergamon Press, London, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is mentioned above that the "displaced quantity" of the Schrödinger wave has values that are dimensionless complex numbers. One may ask what is the physical meaning of those numbers. According to Heisenberg, rather than being of some ordinary physical quantity such as, for example, Maxwell's electric field intensity, or mass density, the Schrödinger-wave packet's "displaced quantity" is probability amplitude. He wrote that instead of using the term 'wave packet', it is preferable to speak of a probability packet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1927). Über den anschlaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik, ''Z. Phys.'' '''43''': 172–198, translated by eds. [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler, J.A.]], [[Wojciech Zurek|Zurek, W.H.]] (1983), at pp. 62–84 of ''Quantum Theory and Measurement'', Princeton University Press, Princeton NJ, p. 73. Also translated as 'The actual content of quantum theoretical kinematics and mechanics' [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19840008978.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; The probability amplitude supports calculation of probability of location or momentum of discrete particles. Heisenberg recites Duane's account of particle diffraction by probabilistic quantal translation momentum transfer, which allows, for example in Young's two-slit experiment, each diffracted particle probabilistically to pass discretely through a particular slit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1930). ''The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory'', translated by C. Eckart, F. C. Hoyt, University of Chicago Press, Chicago IL, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus one does not need necessarily think of the matter wave, as it were, as 'composed of smeared matter'.

These ideas may be expressed in ordinary language as follows. In the account of ordinary physical waves, a 'point' refers to a position in ordinary physical space at an instant of time, at which there is specified a 'displacement' of some physical quantity. But in the account of quantum mechanics, a 'point' refers to a configuration of the system at an instant of time, every particle of the system being in a sense present in every 'point' of configuration space, each particle at such a 'point' being located possibly at a different position in ordinary physical space. There is no explicit definite indication that, at an instant, this particle is 'here' and that particle is 'there' in some separate 'location' in configuration space. This conceptual difference entails that, in contrast to de Broglie's pre-quantum mechanical wave description, the quantum mechanical probability packet description does not directly and explicitly express the Aristotelian idea, referred to by Newton, that causal efficacy propagates through ordinary space by contact, nor the Einsteinian idea that such propagation is no faster than light. In contrast, these ideas are so expressed in the classical wave account, through the [[Green's function]], though it is inadequate for the observed quantal phenomena. The physical reasoning for this was first recognized by Einstein.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, A. (1986).

==De Broglie's phase wave and periodic phenomenon==
De Broglie's thesis started from the hypothesis, "that to each portion of energy with a proper mass {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} one may associate a periodic phenomenon of the frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} , such that one finds: {{math|''hν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is to be measured, of course, in the rest frame of the energy packet. This hypothesis is the basis of our theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Broglie | first1 = L. | authorlink = Louis de Broglie | year = 1923 | title = Waves and quanta | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 112 | issue = 2815| page = 540 | doi=10.1038/112540a0| bibcode = 1923Natur.112..540D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis de Broglie|de Broglie, L.]] (1924).

De Broglie followed his initial hypothesis of a periodic phenomenon, with frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, associated with the energy packet. He used the special theory of relativity to find, in the frame of the observer of the electron energy packet that is moving with velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, that its frequency was apparently reduced to

:&lt;math&gt;f = \nu_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
 
Then
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda f = E/p=v_\mathrm p\,.&lt;/math&gt;

using the same notation as above. The quantity &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm p&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of what de Broglie called the "phase y wave". Its wavelength is &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. De Broglie reasoned that his hypothetical intrinsic particle periodic phenomenon is in phase with that phase wave. This was his basic matter wave conception. He noted, as above, that &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm p &gt; c&lt;/math&gt;, and the phase wave does not transfer energy.&lt;ref name="Medicus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009).

While the concept of waves being associated with matter is correct, de Broglie did not leap directly to the final understanding of quantum mechanics with no missteps. There are conceptual problems with the approach that de Broglie took in his thesis that he was not able to resolve, despite trying a number of different fundamental hypotheses in different papers published while working on, and shortly after publishing, his thesis.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Martins"&gt;{{cite web

These difficulties were resolved by [[Erwin Schrödinger]], who developed the wave mechanics approach, starting from a somewhat different basic hypothesis.

The '''maximum power principle''' or '''Lotka's principle'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tilley |first1=David Rogers |title=Howard T. Odum’s contribution to the laws of energy |journal=Ecological Modelling |date=2004 |volume=178 |pages=121–125 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2003.12.032 |url=http://www.unicamp.br/fea/ortega/extensao/davidtilley-2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been proposed as the fourth [[Principles of energetics|principle of energetics]] in [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]] [[thermodynamics]], where an example of an open system is a biological cell. According to [[Howard T. Odum]], "The maximum power principle can be stated: During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency."&lt;ref&gt;H.T. Odum 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;311&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Chen (2006) has located the origin of the statement of maximum power as a formal principle in a tentative proposal by [[Alfred J. Lotka]] (1922a, b). Lotka's statement sought to explain the Darwinian notion of evolution with reference to a physical principle. Lotka's work was subsequently developed by the [[systems ecology|systems ecologist]] [[Howard T. Odum]] in collaboration with the Chemical Engineer Richard C. Pinkerton, and later advanced by the Engineer [[Myron Tribus]].

While Lotka's work may have been a first attempt to formalise evolutionary thought in mathematical terms, it followed similar observations made by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Vito Volterra|Volterra]] and Ludwig [[Boltzmann]], for example, throughout the sometimes controversial history of natural philosophy.  In contemporary literature it is most commonly associated with the work of Howard T. Odum.

The significance of Odum's approach was given greater support during the 1970s, amid times of [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]], where, as Gilliland (1978, pp.&amp;nbsp;100) observed, there was an emerging need for a new method of analysing the importance and value of energy resources to economic and environmental production. A field known as [[energy analysis]], itself associated with [[net energy]] and [[EROEI]], arose to fulfill this analytic need. However, in energy analysis intractable theoretical and practical difficulties arose when using the [[energy unit]] to understand, a) the conversion among concentrated fuel types (or [[energy types]]), b)  the contribution of labour, and c) the contribution of the environment.

==Philosophy and theory==
Lotka said (1922b: 151): 
{{cquote|The principle of natural selection reveals itself as capable of yielding information which the first and second laws of thermodynamics are not competent to furnish. The two fundamental laws of thermodynamics are, of course, insufficient to determine the course of events in a physical system. They tell us that certain things cannot happen, but they do not tell us what does happen.}}

Gilliland noted that these difficulties in analysis in turn required some new theory to adequately explain the interactions and transactions of these different energies (different concentrations of fuels, labour and environmental forces). Gilliland (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101) suggested that Odum's statement of the maximum power principle (H.T.Odum 1978, pp.&amp;nbsp;54–87) was, perhaps, an adequate expression of the requisite theory:
{{cquote|That theory, as it is expressed by the maximum power principle, addresses the empirical question of why systems of any type or size organize themselves into the patterns observed. Such a question assumes that physical laws govern system function. It does not assume, for example, that the system comprising economic production is driven by consumers; rather that the whole cycle of production-consumption is structured and driven by physical laws.}}

This theory Odum called maximum power theory. In order to formulate maximum power theory Gilliland observed that Odum had added another law (the maximum power principle) to the already well established laws of thermodynamics. In 1978 Gilliland wrote that Odum's new law had not yet been validated (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101). Gilliland stated that in maximum power theory the [[second law efficiency]] of thermodynamics required an additional physical concept: "the concept of second law efficiency under maximum power" (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101):

{{cquote|Neither the first or second law of thermodynamics include a measure of the rate at which energy transformations or processes occur. The concept of maximum power incorporates time into measures of energy transformations. It provides information about the rate at which one kind of energy is transformed into another as well as the efficiency of that transformation.}} 
     
In this way the concept of maximum power was being used as a principle to quantitatively describe the selective law of biological [[evolution]]. Perhaps H.T.Odum's most concise statement of this view was (1970, p.&amp;nbsp;62):

{{cquote|Lotka provided the theory of natural selection as a maximum power organizer; under competitive conditions systems are selected which use their energies in various structural-developing actions so as to maximize their use of available energies. By this theory systems of cycles which drain less energy lose out in comparative development. However Leopold and Langbein have shown that streams in developing erosion profiles, meander systems, and tributary networks disperse their potential energies more slowly than if their channels were more direct. These two statements might be harmonized by an optimum efficiency maximum power principle (Odum and Pinkerton 1955), which indicates that energies which are converted too rapidly into heat are not made available to the systems own use because they are not fed back through storages into useful pumping, but instead do random stirring of the environment.}}

The Odum–Pinkerton approach to Lotka's proposal was to apply [[Ohm's law]] – and the associated [[maximum power theorem]] (a result in [[electric power|electrical power]] systems) – to ecological systems. Odum and Pinkerton defined "power" in electronic terms as the rate of [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], where Work is understood as a "[[Thermodynamic free energy|useful energy]] transformation". &lt;!-- (In electrical engineering and physics, "[[Power (physics)|power]]" is defined as the rate of doing work or consuming energy, without any distinction between "useful energy" and any other energy.) --&gt;The concept of maximum power can therefore be defined as the '''''maximum''' rate of '''useful''' energy transformation''. Hence the underlying philosophy aims to unify the theories and associated laws of electronic and thermodynamic systems with biological systems. This approach presupposed an [[Analogical models|analogical view]] which sees the world as an ecological-electronic-economic engine.

==Proposals for maximum power principle as 4th thermodynamic law==
{{quotation|It has been pointed out by [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]] that the fundamental object of contention in the life-struggle, in the evolution of the organic world, is available energy. In accord with this observation is the principle that, in the struggle for existence, the advantage must go to those organisms whose energy-capturing devices are most efficient in directing available energy into channels favorable to the preservation of the species.|A.J. Lotka 1922a, p. 147}}

{{quotation|...it seems to this author appropriate to unite the biological and physical traditions by giving the Darwinian principle of natural selection the citation as the ''fourth law of thermodynamics'', since it is the controlling principle in rate of heat generation and efficiency settings in irreversible biological processes.|H.T. Odum 1963, p. 437}}

{{quotation|...it may be time to recognize the maximum power principle as the fourth thermodynamic law as suggested by Lotka.|H.T. Odum 1994}}

==Definition in words==
{{cquote|The maximum power principle can be stated: During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency. (H.T. Odum 1995, p. 311)}}

{{cquote|...the maximum power principle ... states that systems which maximize their flow of energy survive in competition. In other words, rather than merely accepting the fact that more energy per unit of time is transformed in a process which operates at maximum power, this principle says that systems organize and structure themselves naturally to maximize power. Systems regulate themselves according to the maximum power principle. Over time, the systems which maximize power are selected for whereas those that do not are selected against and eventually eliminated. ... Odum argues ... that the free market mechanisms of the economy effectively do the same thing for human systems and that our economic evolution to date is a product of that selection process. (Gilliland 1978, pp. 101–102)}}

Odum et al. viewed the [[maximum power theorem]] as a principle of '''power-efficiency reciprocity selection''' with wider application than just electronics. For example, Odum saw it in open systems operating on solar energy, like both photovoltaics and photosynthesis (1963, p.&amp;nbsp;438). Like the maximum power theorem, Odum's statement of the maximum power principle relies on the notion of 'matching', such that high-quality energy maximizes power by matching and amplifying energy (1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;262, 541): "in surviving designs a matching of high-quality energy with larger amounts of low-quality energy is likely to occur" (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;260). As with electronic circuits, the resultant rate of energy transformation will be at a maximum at an intermediate power efficiency. In 2006, T.T. Cai, C.L. Montague and J.S. Davis said that, "The maximum power principle is a potential guide to understanding the patterns and processes of ecosystem development and sustainability. The principle predicts the selective persistence of ecosystem designs that capture a previously untapped energy source." (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;317). In several texts H.T. Odum gave the [[Atwood machine]] as a practical example of the 'principle' of maximum power.

=== Mathematical definition ===
The mathematical definition given by H.T. Odum is formally analogous to the definition provided on the [[maximum power theorem]] article. (For a brief explanation of Odum's approach to the relationship between ecology and electronics see [[Howard T. Odum#Ecological analog of Ohm.27s Law|Ecological Analog of Ohm's Law]])

==Contemporary ideas==
Whether or not the principle of maximum power efficiency can be considered the fourth law of thermodynamics and the fourth principle of energetics is moot. Nevertheless, H.T. Odum also proposed a corollary of maximum power as the organisational principle of evolution, describing the evolution of [[microbiological]] systems, [[economic systems]], [[planet]]ary systems, and [[astrophysical]] systems. He called this corollary the '''[[Maximum empower#Empower and maximum empower|maximum empower]]''' principle.  This was suggested because, as S.E. Jorgensen, M.T. Brown, H.T. Odum (2004) note,

{{quotation|Maximum power might be misunderstood to mean giving priority to low level processes. ... However, the higher level transformation processes are just as important as the low level processes. ... Therefore, Lotka's principle is clarified by stating it as the principle of self organization for maximum ''empower''. |p. 18}}

C. Giannantoni may have confused matters when he wrote "The "Maximum Em-Power Principle" (Lotka–Odum) is generally considered the "Fourth Thermodynamic Principle" (mainly) because of its practical validity for a very wide class of physical and biological systems" (C. Giannantoni 2002, § 13, p.&amp;nbsp;155). Nevertheless,  Giannantoni has proposed the Maximum Em-Power Principle as the fourth principle of thermodynamics (Giannantoni 2006).

The preceding discussion is incomplete. The "maximum power" was discovered several times independently, in physics and engineering, see: Novikov (1957), El-Wakil (1962), and Curzon and Ahlborn (1975). The incorrectness of this analysis and design evolution conclusions was demonstrated by Gyftopoulos (2002).

A '''natural landscape''' is the original landscape that exists before it is acted upon by human culture.&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The area prior to the introduction of man 's activity is represented by one body of morphologic facts. The forms that man has introduced are another set. We may call the former, with reference to man, the original, natural landscape. In its entirety it no longer exists in many parts of the world, but its reconstruction and understanding are the first part of formal morphonology." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'', vol. 2, No. 2, 12 October 1925, p. 37.[https://archive.org/stream/universityofc02univ/universityofc02univ_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; The natural landscape and the [[cultural landscape]] are separate parts of the [[landscape]].&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The cultural landscape is fashioned from a natural landscape by a culture group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape the result." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape", p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the twenty-first century landscapes that are totally untouched by human activity no longer exist, so that reference is sometimes now made to degrees of naturalness within a landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;The [[European Environment Agency]]'s planned forest naturalness index is an example of an attempt to define one type of natural landscape in Europe. The Agency lists forests in three categories: (1) [[Plantations]]; (2) Semi-natural; and (3) Naturally dynamic. The latter are "forests whose structure, composition and function have been shaped by natural dynamics without substantial [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] influence over a long period of time".&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) [[Rachel Carson]] describes a roadside verge as it used to look: "Along the roads, laurel, viburnum and alder, great ferns and wildflowers delighted the traveler’s eye through much of the year" and then how it looks now following the use of [[herbicide]]s: "The roadsides, once so attractive, were now lined with browned and withered vegetation as though swept by fire".&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge, Mass.: Riverside Press, 1962, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the landscape before it is sprayed is biologically degraded, and may well contains alien species, the concept of what might constitute a natural landscape can still be deduced from the context.

The phrase "natural landscape" was first used in connection with [[landscape painting]], and [[landscape gardening]], to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, closer to nature. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769 – 1859) was to further conceptualize this into the idea of a natural landscape ''separate'' from the [[cultural landscape]]. Then in 1908 [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]] developed the terms original landscape (''Urlandschaft'') and its opposite cultural landscape (''Kulturlandschaft'') in an attempt to give the science of geography a subject matter that was different from the other sciences. An early use of the actual phrase "natural landscape" by a [[geographer]] can be found in  [[Carl O. Sauer]]'s paper "The Morphology of Landscape" (1925).&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl O. Sauer]], "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'' 2 (2), pp. 19-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The concept of a natural landscape was first developed in connection with [[landscape painting]], though the actual term itself was first used in relation to [[landscape gardening]]. In both cases it was used to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, that is closer to nature. Chunglin Kwa suggests, "that a seventeenth-century or early-eighteenth-century person could experience natural scenery ‘just like on a painting,’ and so, with or without the use of the word itself, designate it as a landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Chunglin Kwa, "Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape", ''The European Legacy'', Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to landscape gardening John Aikin, commented in 1794: "Whatever, therefore, there be of ''novelty'' in the singular scenery of an artificial garden, it is soon exhausted, whereas the infinite diversity of a natural landscape presents an inexhaustible flore of new forms".&lt;ref&gt;J. Aikin, M.D., ''Letters from a Father to His Son, on Various Topics, Relative to Literature and the Conduct of Life. Written in the Years 1792 and 1793'',  (Philadelphia:  Samuel Harrison Smith), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1844 the prominent American landscape gardener [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] comments: "straight canals, round or oblong pieces of water, and all the regular forms of the geometric mode ... would evidently be in violent opposition to the whole character and expression of natural landscape".&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening Adapted to North America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his extensive travels in South America, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] became the first to conceptualize a natural landscape separate from the cultural landscape, though he does not actually use these terms.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/qnct310.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cele/2005/00000010/00000002/art00002 Chunglin Kwa, Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape, The European Legacy, Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://www.avhumboldt.net/humboldt/publications/paragraph/did/35/vid/38/cid/244/tid/7698/text/The-description-of-nature-in-its-manifold-richness-of-form-as-a-distinct-branch-of-poetic-literat] "The description of nature in its manifold richness of form, as a distinct branch of poetic literature, was wholly unknown to the Greeks. The landscape appears among them merely as the basil-ground of the picture of which human figures constitute the main subject. Passions, breaking forth into action, riveted their attention almost exclusively." Alexander von Humboldt ''[[Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe]]'' (translation 1804), Volume 2, Part I, Paragraph 5, Chapter I.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Jackson Downing was aware of, and sympathetic to, Humboldt's ideas, which therefore influenced American landscape gardening.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Horticulturist'', vol.4, no.2, August 1849, which Downing edited.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]], in 1908, argued that by defining [[geography]] as a ''Landschaftskunde'' (landscape science) would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.&lt;ref&gt;James, P.E &amp; Martin, G (1981) ''All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, T.H (1989) ''Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century''. Entriken, J. Nicholas &amp; Brunn, Stanley D (Eds) ''Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography''. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC., p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He defined two forms of landscape: the ''Urlandschaft'' (original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the ''Kulturlandschaft'' (cultural landscape) a landscape created by human culture. Schlüter argued that the major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.

The term natural landscape is sometimes used as a synonym for [[wilderness]], but for geographers natural landscape is a scientific term which refers to the [[biological]], [[geological]], [[Climatology|climatological]] and other aspects of a landscape, not the cultural values that are implied by the word wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;"The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature". William Cronon, ed., ''Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature''. (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1995), pp. 69–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The natural and conservation===
Matters are complicated by the fact that the words nature and natural have more than one meaning. On the one hand there is the main dictionary meaning for nature: "The phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations".&lt;ref&gt;"Nature", ''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is the growing awareness, especially since [[Charles Darwin]], of humanities biological affinity with nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.seattlepi.com/animals-share-human-dna-sequences-6693.html "Animals That Share Human DNA Sequences", Seattlepi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] of the first definition has its roots is an "ancient concept", because early people viewed "nature, or the nonhuman world […] as a divine ''Other'', godlike in its separation from humans".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), p. 14. They cite William Conron's 1995 essay "The Trouble with Wilderness: or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature".&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western culture|West]], Christianity's myth of [[The fall of man|the fall]], that is the expulsion of humankind from the [[Garden of Eden]], where all creation lived in harmony, into an imperfect world, has been the major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Vining, Melinda Merrick and Emily Price, "The Distinction between Humans and Nature". ''Human Ecology Review'', vol.15, no. 1, 2008, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cartesian dualism]], from the seventeenth century on,  further reinforced this dualistic thinking about nature.&lt;ref&gt;Vining, Merrick and Price, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 
With this [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] goes value judgement as to [[appeal to nature|the superiority of the natural over the artificial]]. Modern science, however, is moving towards a [[holistic]] view of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Kaika, ''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====America====
What is meant by natural, within the American [[conservation movement]], has been changing over the last century and a half.

In the mid-nineteenth century American began to realize that the land was becoming more and more domesticated and wildlife was disappearing. This led to the creation of [[National Park Service|American National Parks]] and other conservation sites.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was believed that all that was needed to do was to separate what was seen as natural landscape and "avoid disturbances such as logging, grazing, fire and insect outbreaks".&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This, and subsequent environmental policy, until recently, was influenced by ideas of the wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;William Cronon, pp. 72-77&lt;/ref&gt; However, this policy was not consistently applied, and in [[Yellowstone Park]], to take one example, the existing ecology was altered, firstly by the exclusion of Native Americans and later with the virtual extermination of the wolf population.&lt;ref name="dow"&gt;{{cite web |title=Defenders of Wildlife |work=A Yellowstone Chronology |url=http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |accessdate=2007-03-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607214843/http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |archivedate=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref{{cite book |last=Merchant |first=Carolyn |title=The Columbia Guide to American Environmental History |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-231-11232-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QQQximQsxSgC |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A century later, in the mid-twentieth century, it began to be believed that the earlier policy of "protection from disturbance was inadequate to preserve park values", and that is that direct human intervention was necessary to restore the landscape of National Parks to its ‘’natural’’ condition.&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"/&gt; In 1963 the [[Leopold Report]] argued that "A national park should represent a vignette of primitive America".&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy change eventually led to the restoration of [[History of wolves in Yellowstone|wolves in Yellowstone Park]] in the 1990s.

However, recent research in various disciplines indicates that a pristine natural or "primitive" landscape is a myth, and it now realised that people have been changing the natural into a cultural landscape for a long while, and that there are few places untouched in some way from human influence.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier conservation policies were now seen as cultural interventions. The idea of what is natural and what artificial or cultural, and how to maintain the natural elements in a landscape, has been further complicated by the discovery of [[global warming]] and how it is changing natural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important is a reaction recently amongst scholars against dualistic thinking about nature and culture. Maria Kaika comments: "Nowadays, we are beginning to see nature and culture as intertwined once again – not [[ontologically]] separated anymore […].What I used to perceive as a compartmentalized world, consisting of neatly and tightly sealed, autonomous ‘space envelopes’ (the home, the city, and nature) was, in fact, a messy socio-spatial continuum”.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; And William Cronon argues against the idea of wilderness because it "involves a dualistic vision in which the human is entirely outside the natural"&lt;ref&gt;Cronon, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and affirms that "wildness (as opposed to wilderness) can be found anywhere" even "in the cracks of a Manhattan sidewalk".&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"&gt;Cronon, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cronon we have to "abandon the dualism that sees the tree in the garden as artificial […] and the tree in the wilderness as natural […] Both in some ultimate sense are wild."&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"/&gt; Here he bends somewhat the regular dictionary meaning of wild, to emphasise that nothing natural, even in a garden, is fully under human control.

====Europe====
The landscape of Europe has considerably altered by people and even in an area, like the [[Cairngorm Mountains]] of [[Scotland]], with a low population density, only " the high summits of the [[Cairngorm Mountains]], consist entirely of natural elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snh.gov.uk/about-scotlands-nature/scotlands-landscapes/what-is-landscape/  [[Scottish Natural Heritage]], ]&lt;/ref&gt; These ''high summits'' are of course only part of the Cairngorms, and there are no longer wolves, bears, wild boar or lynx in Scotland's wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6155172.stm | title = Extinct Island Pig Spotted Again | publisher = BBC News | date = 17 November 2006 | accessdate =1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser Darling and Boyd 1969 64"&gt;Fraser Darling and Boyd (1969) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scots pine]] in the form of the [[Caledonian forest]] also covered much more of the Scottish landscape than today.&lt;ref&gt;Steven, H. M. &amp; Carlisle, A. (1959). ''The Native Pinewoods of Scotland''. Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swiss National Park]], however, represent a more natural landscape. It was founded in 1914, and is one of the earliest national parks in Europe.
Visitors are not allowed to leave the motor road, or paths through the park, make fire or camp. The only building within the park is Chamanna Cluozza, [[mountain hut]]. It is also forbidden to disturb the animals or the plants, or to take home anything found in the park. Dogs are not allowed. Due to these strict rules, the Swiss National Park is the only park in the Alps who has been categorized by the [[IUCN]] as a [[strict nature reserve]], which is the highest protection level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=SWI+01&amp;mode=all Parc Suisse Biosphere Reserve]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of natural landscape==
No place on the Earth is unaffected by people and their culture. People are part of [[biodiversity]], but human activity affects biodiversity, and this alters the natural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607101209/http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html |date=7 June 2007 }} American Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; Mankind have altered landscape to such an extent that few places on earth remain pristine, but once free of human influences, the landscape can return to a natural or near natural state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4uDb0H4V5c YouTube, Professor James Lovelock, We can't save the planet, BBC NEWS, 2010/03/30]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wrangell St. Elias National Park.jpg|thumb| [[Glacier]] on the border between [[Alaska]], US, and Canada: [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system]]
Even the remote [[Yukon]] and [[Alaskan]] wilderness, the bi-national [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system comprising [[Kluane National Park|Kluane]], [[Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve|Wrangell-St Elias]], [[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve|Glacier Bay]] and [[Tatshenshini-Alsek Park|Tatshenshini-Alsek]] parks, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is not free from human influence, because the [[Kluane National Park]] lies within the traditional territories of the Champagne and Aishihik [[First Nations]] and [[Kluane First Nation]] who have a long history of living in this region. Through their respective Final Agreements with the Canadian Government, they have made into law their rights to harvest in this region.

==Examples of cultural forces==
Cultural forces intentionally or unintentionally, have an influence upon the landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://lamar.colostate.edu/%7Ehrolston/Technol-vs-Nature-Aberdeen.pdf "It is true that certain human technological actions do have unintended consequences that spread everywhere; there are contagious effects that seep into the nooks and crannies of all nature." Holmes Rolston III, "Technology versus nature, What is natural, Journal of Philosophy and Technology", ''Ends and Means'', Vol 2 No.2 Spring 1998, University of Aberdeen, Edinburgh University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural landscapes]] are places or artifacts created and maintained by people. Examples of cultural intrusions into a landscape are: fences, roads, parking lots, sand pits, buildings, hiking trails, management of plants, including the introduction of [[invasive species]], extraction or removal of plants, management of animals, mining, hunting, [[natural landscaping]], farming and forestry, pollution. Areas that might be confused with a natural landscape include [[public park]]s, farms, orchards, artificial lakes and reservoirs, managed forests, golf courses, nature center trails, gardens.

[[File:Coal mine Wyoming.jpg|thumb|right|325px|A [[coal mining|coal mine]] in [[Wyoming]], [[United States]]. [[Coal]], produced over millions of years, is a finite and non-renewable resource on a human time scale.]]

A '''non-renewable resource''' (also called a '''finite resource''') is a resource that does not renew itself at a sufficient rate for sustainable economic extraction in meaningful human time-frames. An example is carbon-based, organically-derived fuel. The original organic material, with the aid of heat and pressure, becomes a fuel such as oil or gas. [[Earth]] [[mineral]]s and [[metal]] [[ore]]s, [[fossil fuel]]s ([[coal]], [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]]) and [[groundwater]] in certain [[aquifer]]s are all considered non-renewable resources, though individual [[Chemical element|element]]s are almost always conserved.

On the other hand, resources such as [[timber]] (when [[Sustainable forest management|harvested sustainably]]) and wind (used to power energy conversion systems) are considered [[renewable resource]]s, largely because their localized replenishment can occur within time frames meaningful to humans.

== Earth minerals and metal ores ==
{{Main article|Mineral|Ore}}
{{Further information|Mining}}

[[Earth]] minerals and [[metal]] ores are examples of non-renewable resources. The metals themselves are present in vast amounts in Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]], and their extraction by humans only occurs where they are concentrated by [[Ore genesis|natural geological processes]] (such as heat, pressure, organic activity, weathering and other processes) enough to become economically viable to extract. These processes generally take from tens of thousands to millions of years, through [[plate tectonics]], [[tectonic subsidence]] and [[crustal recycling]].

The localized deposits of metal ores near the surface which can be extracted economically by humans are non-renewable in human time-frames. There are certain [[rare earth mineral]]s and [[rare earth element|elements]] that are more scarce and exhaustible than others. These are in high demand in [[manufacturing]], particularly for the [[electronics industry]].

Most metal ores are considered vastly greater in supply to fossil fuels, because metal ores are formed by crustal-scale processes which make up a much larger portion of the Earth's near-surface environment, than those that form fossil fuels which are limited to areas where carbon-based life forms flourish, die, and are quickly buried.

== Fossil fuels ==
{{Main article|Fossil fuel}}
{{Further information|Oil depletion}}

Natural resources such as [[coal]], [[petroleum]] (crude oil) and [[natural gas]] take thousands of years to form naturally and cannot be replaced as fast as they are being consumed. Eventually it is considered that fossil-based resources will become too costly to harvest and humanity will need to shift its reliance to other sources of energy such as solar or wind power, see [[renewable energy]].

An alternative hypothesis is that carbon based fuel is virtually inexhaustible in human terms, if one includes all sources of carbon-based energy such as methane hydrates on the sea floor, which are vastly greater than all other carbon based fossil fuel resources combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://worldoceanreview.com/en/wor-1/energy/methane-hydrates/ |title=Methane hydrates |website=Worldoceanreview.com |access-date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sources of carbon are also considered non-renewable, although their rate of formation/replenishment on the sea floor is not known. However their extraction at economically viable costs and rates has yet to be determined.

At present, the main energy source used by humans is non-renewable [[fossil fuels]].  Since the dawn of [[internal combustion engine]] technologies in the 19th century, petroleum and other fossil fuels have remained in continual demand.  As a result, conventional [[infrastructure]] and [[transport]] systems, which are fitted to combustion engines, remain prominent throughout the globe.  The continual use of fossil fuels at the current rate is believed to increase [[global warming]] and cause more severe [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=America's Climate Choices: Panel on Advancing the Science of Climate Change; National Research Council|title=Advancing the Science of Climate Change |year=2010|publisher=The National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-309-14588-0|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] (WCED) an organization set up by but independent from the [[United Nations]] classified fission reactors that produce more [[fissile]] nuclear fuel than they consume -i.e. [[breeder reactor]]s, and when it is developed, [[fusion power]], among conventional renewable energy sources, such as [[Sun|solar]] and [[Hydropower|falling water]].&lt;ref name="Brundtland"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 7: Energy: Choices for Environment and Development|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-07.htm|work=Our Common Future: Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development|first=Gro Harlem|last=Brundtland|location=Oslo|date=20 March 1987|accessdate=27 March 2013|quote=Today's primary sources of energy are mainly non-renewable: natural gas, oil, coal, peat, and conventional nuclear power. There are also renewable sources, including wood, plants, dung, falling water, geothermal sources, solar, tidal, wind, and wave energy, as well as human and animal muscle-power. Nuclear reactors that produce their own fuel ("breeders") and eventually fusion reactors are also in this category}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Petroleum Institute]] likewise does not consider conventional nuclear fission as renewable, but that [[breeder reactor]] nuclear power fuel is considered renewable and sustainable, before explaining that radioactive waste from used [[spent fuel]] rods remains radioactive, and so has to be very carefully stored for up to a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.api.org/classroom/curricula/nonrenew-resources.cfm|title=Key Characteristics of Nonrenewable Resources|author=American Petroleum Institute|accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the careful monitoring of radioactive waste products also being required upon the use of other renewable energy sources, such as [[geothermal energy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/radiation/tenorm/geothermal.html Geothermal Energy Production Waste.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[nuclear technology]] relying on [[Nuclear fission|fission]] requires [[Naturally occurring radioactive material]] as fuel. [[Uranium]], the most common fission fuel, and is present in the ground at relatively low concentrations and [[uranium mining|mined]] in 19 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf23.html|title=World Uranium Mining|publisher=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mined uranium is used to fuel energy-generating nuclear reactors with [[Fissile|fissionable]] [[uranium-235]] which generates heat that is ultimately used to power [[turbine]]s to generate electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/education/uran.html|title=What is uranium?

As of 2013 only a few kilograms (picture available) of uranium have been extracted from the ocean in [[pilot program]]s and it is also believed that the uranium extracted on an industrial scale from the seawater would constantly be replenished from uranium [[leaching (metallurgy)|leached]] from the ocean floor, maintaining the seawater concentration at a stable level.&lt;ref name="gepr.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gepr.org/en/contents/20130729-01/ |title= The current state of promising research into extraction of uranium from seawater — Utilization of Japan's plentiful seas}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, with the advances made in the efficiency of seawater uranium extraction, a paper in the journal of ''Marine Science &amp; Engineering'' suggests that with, light water reactors as its target, the process would be [[economy of scale|economically competitive if implemented on a large scale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/2/1/81 Development of a Kelp-Type Structure Module in a Coastal Ocean Model to Assess the Hydrodynamic Impact of Seawater Uranium Extraction Technology.

Nuclear power provides about 6% of the world's energy and 13–14% of the world's electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Nuclear Association]]. [http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/newsarticle.aspx?id=27665 Another drop in nuclear generation] ''World Nuclear News'', 5 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nuclear energy production is associated with potentially dangerous [[radioactive contamination]] as it relies upon unstable elements.  In particular, nuclear power facilities produce about 200,000 metric tons of [[low and intermediate level waste]] (LILW) and 10,000 metric tons of [[high level waste]] (HLW) (including spent fuel designated as waste) each year worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Factsheets/English/manradwa.html |title=Factsheets &amp; FAQs |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) |accessdate=2012-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125062648/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Factsheets/English/manradwa.html |archivedate=25 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues entirely separate from the question of the sustainability of nuclear fuel, relate to the use of nuclear fuel and the high-level radioactive waste the nuclear industry generates that if not properly contained, is [[Acute radiation syndrome|highly hazardous]] to people and wildlife.   The United Nations ([[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation|UNSCEAR]]) estimated in 2008 that average annual human radiation exposure includes 0.01 [[millisievert]] (mSv) from the legacy of past atmospheric nuclear testing plus the [[Chernobyl disaster]] and the nuclear fuel cycle, along with 2.0 mSv from natural radioisotopes and 0.4 mSv from [[cosmic ray]]s; all exposures [[Background radiation|vary by location]].&lt;ref name = UNSCEAR&gt;United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation.

[[Natural resource]]s, known as renewable resources, are replaced by [[Natural phenomenon|natural processes and forces]] persistent in the [[natural environment]]. There are [[Intermittent energy source|intermittent]] and reoccurring renewables, and [[Recycling|recyclable material]]s, which are utilized during a [[Biogeochemical cycle|cycle]] across a certain amount of time, and can be harnessed for any number of cycles.

The production of goods and services by [[manufacturing]] [[Product (business)|product]]s in [[economic system]]s creates many [[List of waste types|types of waste]] during production and after the [[consumer]] has made use of it. The material is then either [[Incineration|incinerated]], buried in a [[landfill]] or [[recycled]] for reuse.  Recycling turns materials of value that would otherwise become waste into valuable resources again.

The natural environment, with [[soil]], [[water]], [[forest]]s, [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s are all renewable resources, as long as they are adequately [[Conservation biology|monitored, protected and conserved]]. [[Sustainable agriculture]] is the cultivation of plant and animal materials in a manner that preserves plant and animal [[ecosystem]]s over the long term. The [[overfishing]] of the oceans is one example of where an industry practice or method can threaten an ecosystem, endanger [[endangered species|species]] and possibly even determine whether or not a [[fishery]] is sustainable for use by humans. An unregulated industry practice or method can lead to a complete [[resource depletion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing In Small-Scale Marine and Inland Capture Fisharies|url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/005/Y3274E/y3274e09.htm|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The renewable energy from the [[sun]], [[wind]], [[surface wave|wave]], [[biomass]] and [[Geothermal gradient|geothermal]] energies are based on renewable resources. Renewable resources such as the movement of [[water]] ([[hydropower]], [[tidal power]] and [[wave power]]), [[wind power|wind]] and [[radiant energy]] from geothermal heat (used for [[geothermal power]]) and solar energy (used for [[Solar energy|solar power]]) are practically infinite and cannot be depleted, unlike their non-renewable counterparts, which are likely to run out if not used sparingly.

The potential wave energy on coastlines can provide 1/5 of world demand. Hydroelectric power can supply 1/3 of our total energy global needs. Geothermal energy can provide 1.5 more times the energy we need. There is enough wind to power the planet 30 times over, wind power could power all of humanity's needs alone. Solar currently supplies only 0.1% of our world energy needs, but there is enough out there to power humanity's needs 4,000 times over, the entire global projected energy demand by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;R. Eisenberg and D. Nocera, "Preface: Overview of the Forum on Solar and Renewable Energy," Inorg. Chem. 44, 6799 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. V. Kamat, "Meeting the Clean Energy Demand: Nanostructure Architectures for Solar Energy Conversion," J. Phys. Chem. C 111, 2834 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy and [[Energy conservation|energy efficiency]] are no longer niche [[Economic sector|sector]]s that are promoted only by governments and environmentalists. The increasing levels of investment and that more of the capital is from conventional financial actors, both suggest that sustainable energy has become mainstream and the future of energy production, as non-renewable resources decline. This is reinforced by [[climate change]] concerns, nuclear dangers and accumulating radioactive waste, [[2000s energy crisis|high oil prices]], [[peak oil]] and increasing government support for renewable energy. These factors are [[renewable energy commercialization|commercializing renewable energy]], enlarging the market and growing demand, the adoption of new products to replace obsolete technology and the conversion of existing infrastructure to a renewable standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://energy-base.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/SEFI-Global-Trends-in-Sustainable-Energy-Investment-2007.pdf |title=Global Trends in Sustainable Energy Investment 2007: Analysis of Trends and Issues in the Financing of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency in OECD and Developing Countries (PDF), p. 3. |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic models==
In economics, a non-renewable resource is defined as [[Good (economics)|goods]], where greater consumption today implies less consumption tomorrow.&lt;ref&gt;Cremer and Salehi-Isfahani 1991:18&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ricardo]] in his early works analysed the pricing of exhaustible resources, where he argued that the price of a mineral resource should increase over time. He argued that the spot price is always determined by the mine with the highest cost of extraction, and mine owners with lower extraction costs benefit from a differential rent. The first model is defined by [[Hotelling's rule]], which is a 1931 economic model of non-renewable [[resource management]] by [[Harold Hotelling]]. It shows that efficient exploitation of a nonrenewable and nonaugmentable resource would, under otherwise stable conditions, lead to a [[resource depletion|depletion]] of the resource. The rule states that this would lead to a net price or "[[Hotelling rent]]" for it that rose annually at a rate equal to the [[rate of interest]], reflecting the increasing scarcity of the resources.
The [[Hartwick's rule]] provides an important result about the [[sustainability]] of welfare in an economy that uses non-renewable source.

The '''observable universe''' is a [[celestial sphere|spherical region]] of the [[Universe]] comprising all [[matter]] that can be [[observation|observed]] from [[Earth]] at the present time, because [[electromagnetic radiation]] from these [[astronomical object|objects]] has had time to reach Earth since the beginning of the [[metric expansion of space|cosmological expansion]]. There are at least 2 trillion [[galaxy|galaxies]] in the observable universe.&lt;ref name="Conselice"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Evolution of Galaxy Number Density at ''z'' &lt; 8 and Its Implications |first=Christopher J. |last=Conselice et al |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=830 |issue=2 |year=2016 |arxiv=1607.03909v2 |bibcode= 2016ApJ...830...83C |doi=10.3847/0004-637X/830/2/83 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20161017"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fountain |first=Henry |title=Two Trillion Galaxies, at the Very Least |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/science/two-trillion-galaxies-at-the-very-least.html |date=17 October 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |access-date=17 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the Universe is [[isotropy|isotropic]], the distance to the edge of the observable universe is roughly [[equidistant|the same]] in every direction. That is, the observable universe has a [[sphere|spherical]] volume (a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]]) centered on the observer. Every location in the Universe has its own observable universe, which may or may not overlap with the one [[geocentric model|centered on Earth]].

The word ''observable'' in this sense does not refer to the capability of modern technology to detect [[light]] or other information from an object, or whether there is anything to be detected. It refers to the physical limit created by the [[speed of light]] itself. Because no signals can travel faster than light, any object farther away from us than light could travel in the [[age of the Universe]] (estimated {{as of|2015|lc=y}} around {{val|13.799|0.021|ul=billion}} years&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"/&gt;) simply cannot be detected, as they have not reached us yet. Sometimes astrophysicists distinguish between the ''visible'' universe, which includes only signals emitted since [[Recombination_(cosmology)|recombination]]—and the ''observable'' universe, which includes signals since the beginning of the cosmological expansion (the [[Big Bang cosmology|Big Bang]] in traditional [[physical cosmology]], the end of the [[inflationary epoch]] in modern cosmology).

According to calculations, the current ''[[comoving distance]]''—proper distance, which takes into account that the universe has expanded since the light was emitted—to particles from which the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMBR) was emitted, which represent the radius of the visible universe, is about 14.0 billion [[parsec]]s (about 45.7 billion light-years), while the comoving distance to the edge of the observable universe is about 14.3 billion parsecs (about 46.6 billion light-years),&lt;ref name="mapofuniverse"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Gott III|first = J.

Since the expansion of the universe is known to accelerate and will become exponential in the future, the light emitted from all distant objects, past some time dependent on their current [[redshift]], will never reach the Earth. In the future all currently observable objects will slowly freeze in time while emitting progressively redder and fainter light. For instance, objects with the current redshift ''z'' from 5 to 10 will remain observable for no more than 4–6 billion years. In addition, light emitted by objects currently situated beyond a certain comoving distance (currently about 19 billion parsecs) will never reach Earth.&lt;ref name=Loeb2002&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.65.047301|title=Long-term future of extragalactic astronomy|journal=Physical Review D|volume=65|issue=4|year=2002|last1=Loeb|first1=Abraham|arxiv=astro-ph/0107568|bibcode=2002PhRvD..65d7301L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The universe versus the observable universe ==
{{Physical cosmology|comp/struct}}
Some parts of the universe are too far away for the light emitted since the [[Big Bang]] to have had enough time to reach Earth, and so lie outside the observable universe. In the future, light from distant galaxies will have had more time to travel, so additional regions will become observable. However, due to [[Hubble's law]], regions sufficiently distant from the Earth are expanding away from it faster than the speed of light ([[special relativity]] prevents nearby objects in the same local region from moving faster than the speed of light with respect to each other, but there is no such constraint for distant objects when the space between them is expanding; see [[Comoving and proper distances#Uses of the proper distance|uses of the proper distance]] for a discussion) and furthermore the [[Accelerating expansion of the universe|expansion rate appears to be accelerating]] due to [[dark energy]]. Assuming dark energy remains constant (an unchanging [[cosmological constant]]), so that the expansion rate of the universe continues to accelerate, there is a "future visibility limit" beyond which objects will ''never'' enter our observable universe at any time in the infinite future, because light emitted by objects outside that limit would never reach the Earth. (A subtlety is that, because the [[Hubble's law#Interpretation|Hubble parameter]] is decreasing with time, there can be cases where a galaxy that is receding from the Earth just a bit faster than light does emit a signal that reaches the Earth eventually.&lt;ref name=ly93 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=575 Is the universe expanding faster than the speed of light?] (see the last two paragraphs)&lt;/ref&gt;) This future visibility limit is calculated at a [[comoving distance]] of 19 billion parsecs (62 billion light-years), assuming the universe will keep expanding forever, which implies the number of galaxies that we can ever theoretically observe in the infinite future (leaving aside the issue that some may be impossible to observe in practice due to redshift, as discussed in the following paragraph) is only larger than the number currently observable by a factor of 2.36.&lt;ref name="mapofuniverse2"&gt;The comoving distance of the future visibility limit is calculated on p. 8 of Gott et al.'s [http://www.astro.princeton.edu/universe/ms.pdf A Map of the Universe] to be 4.50 times the [[Hubble radius]], given as 4.220 billion parsecs (13.76 billion light-years), whereas the current comoving radius of the observable universe is calculated on p. 7 to be 3.38 times the Hubble radius. The number of galaxies in a sphere of a given comoving radius is proportional to the cube of the radius, so as shown on p. 8 the ratio between the number of galaxies observable in the future visibility limit to the number of galaxies observable today would be (4.50/3.38)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 2.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Science Friday, 3 Apr 2009. According to the [https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=102715275 transcript], [[Brian Greene]] makes the comment "And actually, in the far future, everything we now see, except for our local galaxy and a region of galaxies will have disappeared.

For example, the current distance to this horizon is about 16 billion light-years, meaning that a signal from an event happening ''at present'' can eventually reach the Earth in the future if the event is less than 16 billion light-years away, but the signal will never reach the Earth if the event is more than 16 billion light-years away.&lt;ref name=ly93 /&gt;

Both popular and professional research articles in cosmology often use the term "universe" to mean "observable universe".{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} This can be justified on the grounds that we can never know anything by direct experimentation about any part of the universe that is [[Causality (physics)|causally disconnected]] from the Earth, although many credible theories require a total universe much larger than the observable universe.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} No evidence exists to suggest that the boundary of the observable universe constitutes a boundary on the universe as a whole, nor do any of the mainstream cosmological models propose that the universe has any physical boundary in the first place, though some models propose it could be finite but unbounded, like a higher-dimensional analogue of the 2D surface of a sphere that is finite in area but has no edge. It is plausible that the [[galaxy|galaxies]] within our observable universe represent only a minuscule fraction of the galaxies in the universe. According to the theory of [[cosmic inflation]] initially introduced by its founder, [[Alan Guth]] (and by D. Kazanas &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title="Dynamics of the Universe and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking" Kazanas, D., Ap. J. (Lett.), 241, L59-L63.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), if it is assumed that inflation began about 10&lt;sup&gt;−37&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang, then with the plausible assumption that the size of the universe before the inflation occurred was approximately equal to the speed of light times its age, that would suggest that at present the entire universe's size is at least 3×10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; times the radius of the observable universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan H.

If the universe is finite but unbounded, it is also possible that the universe is ''smaller'' than the observable universe. In this case, what we take to be very distant galaxies may actually be duplicate images of nearby galaxies, formed by light that has circumnavigated the universe. It is difficult to test this hypothesis experimentally because different images of a galaxy would show different eras in its history, and consequently might appear quite different.

=== Misconceptions on its size === &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Universe]] --&gt;
[[File:Incorrect plaque at the Rose Center for Earth and Space, April 2011.jpg|thumb|An example of the misconception that the radius of the observable universe is 13 billion light-years. This plaque appears at the [[Rose Center for Earth and Space]] in New York City.]]
Many secondary sources have reported a wide variety of incorrect figures for the size of the visible universe. Some of these figures are listed below, with brief descriptions of possible reasons for misconceptions about them.

;13.8 billion light-years
:The [[age of the universe]] is estimated to be 13.8 billion years. While it is commonly understood that nothing can accelerate to velocities equal to or greater than that of light, it is a common misconception that the radius of the observable universe must therefore amount to only 13.8 billion light-years. This reasoning would only make sense if the flat, static [[Minkowski space]]time conception under special relativity were correct. In the real universe, [[spacetime]] is curved in a way that corresponds to the [[Expansion of the universe|expansion of space]], as evidenced by [[Hubble's law]]. Distances obtained as the speed of light multiplied by a cosmological time interval have no direct physical significance.&lt;ref&gt;Ned Wright, [http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/Dltt_is_Dumb.html "Why the Light Travel Time Distance should not be used in Press Releases"].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since the early 1980s, more and more structures have been discovered. In 1983, Adrian Webster identified the Webster LQG, a [[large quasar group]] consisting of 5 quasars. The discovery was the first identification of a large-scale structure, and has expanded the information about the known grouping of matter in the universe. In 1987, Robert Brent Tully identified the [[Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex]], the galaxy filament in which the Milky Way resides. It is about 1 billion light-years across. That same year, an unusually large region with a much lower than average distribution of galaxies was discovered, the [[Giant Void]], which measures 1.3 billion light-years across. Based on [[redshift survey]] data, in 1989 [[Margaret Geller]] and [[John Huchra]] discovered the "[[CfA2 Great Wall|Great Wall]]",&lt;ref name="redshift"&gt;{{cite journal |author= M. J. Geller |author2=J. P.

The existence of this structure escaped notice for so long because it requires locating the position of galaxies in three dimensions, which involves combining location information about the galaxies with distance information from [[redshift]]s.
Two years later, astronomers Roger G. Clowes and Luis E. Campusano discovered the [[Clowes–Campusano LQG]], a [[large quasar group]] measuring two billion light-years at its widest point which was the largest known structure in the universe at the time of its announcement. In April 2003, another large-scale structure was discovered, the [[Sloan Great Wall]]. In August 2007, a possible supervoid was detected in the constellation [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12546-biggest-void-in-space-is-1-billion-light-years-across.html Biggest void in space is 1 billion light years across – space – 24 August 2007 – New Scientist]. Space.newscientist.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; It coincides with the '[[CMB cold spot]]', a cold region in the microwave sky that is highly improbable under the currently favored cosmological model. This supervoid could cause the cold spot, but to do so it would have to be improbably big, possibly a billion light-years across, almost as big as the Giant Void mentioned above.
[[File:Large-scale structure of light distribution in the universe.jpg|thumb|Computer simulated image of an area of space more than 50 million light-years across, presenting a possible large-scale distribution of light sources in the universe—precise relative contributions of galaxies and quasars are unclear.]]
Another large-scale structure is the [[SSA22 Protocluster]], a collection of galaxies and enormous gas bubbles that measures about 200 million light-years across.

In 2011, a large quasar group was discovered, [[U1.11]], measuring about 2.5 billion light-years across. On January 11, 2013, another large quasar group, the [[Huge-LQG]], was discovered, which was measured to be four billion light-years across, the largest known structure in the universe at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wall | first = Mike | url = http://www.foxnews.com/science/2013/01/11/largest-structure-in-universe-discovered/ | title = Largest structure in universe discovered | date = 2013-01-11 | publisher = [[Fox News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, astronomers discovered the [[Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall]],&lt;ref name=2014paper&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Horváth |first1=I |last2=Hakkila |first2=Jon |last3=Bagoly |first3=Z. | title = Possible structure in the GRB sky distribution at redshift two | date = 2014 |arxiv=1401.0533 |bibcode=2014A&amp;A...561L..12H |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201323020 |volume=561 |journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |pages=L12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=original&gt;{{cite arXiv |last = Horvath |first = I. |last2= Hakkila |first2=J. |last3=Bagoly |first3=Z. |title = The largest structure of the Universe, defined by Gamma-Ray Bursts |date = 2013 |eprint=1311.1104 |class=astro-ph.CO}}&lt;/ref&gt; an even bigger structure twice as large as the former.

===End of Greatness===
The ''End of Greatness'' is an observational scale discovered at roughly 100&amp;nbsp;[[Megaparsec|Mpc]] (roughly 300 million light-years) where the lumpiness seen in the large-scale structure of the [[universe]] is [[wiktionary:homogeneous|homogenized]] and [[isotropic|isotropized]] in accordance with the [[Cosmological Principle]].&lt;ref name=Kirshner /&gt; At this scale, no pseudo-random [[fractal]]ness is apparent.&lt;ref&gt;LiveScience.com, [https://news.yahoo.com/universe-isnt-fractal-study-finds-215053937.html "The Universe Isn't a Fractal, Study Finds"], Natalie Wolchover,22 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[supercluster]]s and [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] seen in smaller surveys are [[random]]ized to the extent that the smooth distribution of the universe is visually apparent. It was not until the [[redshift survey]]s of the 1990s were completed that this scale could accurately be observed.&lt;ref name=Kirshner&gt;{{cite book |title=The Extravagant Universe: Exploding Stars, Dark Energy and the Accelerating Cosmos |author=Robert P Kirshner |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qQ_mV2prqNYC&amp;pg=PA71 |page=71 |isbn=0-691-05862-8 |date=2002 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observations===
[[File:2MASS LSS chart-NEW Nasa.jpg|right|399px|thumb|"Panoramic view of the entire near-infrared sky reveals the distribution of galaxies beyond the [[Milky Way]]. The image is derived from the [[2MASS|2MASS Extended Source Catalog (XSC)]]—more than 1.5 million galaxies, and the Point Source Catalog (PSC)—nearly 0.5 billion Milky Way stars. The galaxies are color-coded by '[[redshift]]' obtained from the [[Uppsala General Catalogue|UGC]], [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics|CfA]], Tully NBGC, LCRS, [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dF]], 6dFGS, and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]] surveys (and from various observations compiled by the [[NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database|NASA Extragalactic Database]]), or photo-metrically deduced from the [[K band (infrared)|K band]] (2.2 μm). Blue are the nearest sources (''z'' &lt; 0.01); green are at moderate distances (0.01 &lt; ''z'' &lt; 0.04) and red are the most distant sources that 2MASS resolves (0.04 &lt; ''z'' &lt; 0.1). The map is projected with an equal area Aitoff in the Galactic system (Milky Way at center)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Large Scale Structure in the Local Universe: The 2MASS Galaxy Catalog |last=1Jarrett |first1=T.

Another indicator of large-scale structure is the '[[Lyman-alpha forest]]'. This is a collection of [[Spectral line|absorption lines]] that appear in the spectra of light from [[quasar]]s, which are interpreted as indicating the existence of huge thin sheets of intergalactic (mostly [[hydrogen]]) gas. These sheets appear to be associated with the formation of new galaxies.

Caution is required in describing structures on a cosmic scale because things are often different from how they appear. [[Gravitational lens]]ing (bending of light by gravitation) can make an image appear to originate in a different direction from its real source. This is caused when foreground objects (such as galaxies) curve surrounding spacetime (as predicted by [[general relativity]]), and deflect passing light rays. Rather usefully, strong gravitational lensing can sometimes magnify distant galaxies, making them easier to detect. [[Weak Gravitational Lensing|Weak lensing]] (gravitational shear) by the intervening universe in general also subtly changes the observed large-scale structure. 

The large-scale structure of the universe also looks different if one only uses [[redshift]] to measure distances to galaxies. For example, galaxies behind a galaxy cluster are attracted to it, and so fall towards it, and so are slightly blueshifted (compared to how they would be if there were no cluster) On the near side, things are slightly redshifted. Thus, the environment of the cluster looks a bit squashed if using redshifts to measure distance. An opposite effect works on the galaxies already within a cluster: the galaxies have some random motion around the cluster center, and when these random motions are converted to redshifts, the cluster appears elongated. This creates a "''[[Redshift-space distortions|finger of God]]''"—the illusion of a long chain of galaxies pointed at the Earth.

===Cosmography of Earth's cosmic neighborhood===
At the centre of the [[Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster]], a gravitational anomaly called the [[Great Attractor]] affects the motion of galaxies over a region hundreds of millions of light-years across. These galaxies are all [[redshift]]ed, in accordance with [[Hubble's law]]. This indicates that they are receding from us and from each other, but the variations in their redshift are sufficient to reveal the existence of a concentration of mass equivalent to tens of thousands of galaxies.

The Great Attractor, discovered in 1986, lies at a distance of between 150 million and 250 million light-years (250 million is the most recent estimate), in the direction of the [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] and [[Centaurus]] [[constellation]]s. In its vicinity there is a preponderance of large old galaxies, many of which are colliding with their neighbours, or radiating large amounts of radio waves.

In 1987, [[astronomer]] [[R. Brent Tully]] of the [[University of Hawaii]]'s Institute of Astronomy identified what he called the [[Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex]], a structure one billion [[light-year]]s long and 150 million light-years across in which, he claimed, the Local Supercluster was embedded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/10/science/massive-clusters-of-galaxies-defy-concepts-of-the-universe.html?pagewanted=all Massive Clusters of Galaxies Defy Concepts of the Universe N.Y.

==Mass of ordinary matter==
The mass of the observable universe is often quoted as 10&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt; tonnes or 10&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt; kg.&lt;ref name="Paul Davies 2006 43"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, mass refers to ordinary matter and includes the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) and the [[intergalactic medium]] (IGM). However, it excludes [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]]. This quoted value for the mass of ordinary matter in the universe can be estimated based on critical density. The calculations are for the observable universe only as the volume of the whole is unknown and may be infinite.
===Estimates based on critical density===
Critical density is the energy density for which the universe is flat.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter]].&lt;/ref&gt; If there is no dark energy, it is also the [[density]] for which the expansion of the universe is poised between continued expansion and collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michio Kaku|title=Parallel Worlds| url= https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_4_8?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=parallel+worlds&amp;sprefix=Parallel%2Cstripbooks%2C271| accessdate=1 July 2013 |date=2005|publisher=Anchor Books|isbn=978-1-4000-3372-0|page=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Friedmann equations]], the value for &lt;math&gt;\rho_c&lt;/math&gt; critical density, is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard F. Schutz|title=Gravity from the ground up|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEZNXvYwyNwC&amp;pg=PA361|accessdate=1 May 2011|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-45506-0|pages=361–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_c = \frac{3 H^2}{8 \pi G},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]] and H = ''H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the present value of the [[Hubble constant]]. The current value for ''H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', due to the European Space Agency's Planck Telescope, is ''H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 67.15 kilometers per second per mega parsec. This gives a critical density of {{val|0.85|e=-26|u=kg/m3}} (commonly quoted as about 5 hydrogen atoms per cubic meter). This density includes four significant types of energy/mass: ordinary matter (4.8%), neutrinos (0.1%), [[cold dark matter]] (26.8%), and [[dark energy]] (68.3%).&lt;ref name='planck_cosmological_parameters'&gt;{{cite journal | arxiv=1303.5076 | title=Planck 2013 results. XVI. Cosmological parameters | author=Planck collaboration | journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics | date=2013|bibcode = 2014A&amp;A...571A..16P | doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201321591 | volume=571 | pages=A16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that although neutrinos are [[Standard Model]] particles, they are listed separately because they are difficult to detect and so different from ordinary matter. The density of ordinary matter, as measured by Planck, is 4.8% of the total critical density or {{val|4.08|e=-28|u=kg/m3}}. To convert this density to mass we must multiply by volume, a value based on the radius of the "observable universe". Since the universe has been expanding for 13.8 billion years, the [[Comoving and proper distances|comoving distance]] (radius) is now about 46.6 billion light-years. Thus, volume ({{sfrac|4|3}}''πr''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) equals {{val|3.58|e=80|u=m3}} and the mass of ordinary matter equals density ({{val|4.08|e=-28|u=kg/m3}}) times volume ({{val|3.58|e=80|u=m3}}) or {{val|1.46|e=53|u=kg}}.

=={{anchor|Matter content}} Matter content – number of atoms==
&lt;!-- [[Atoms in the universe]] redirects here --&gt;
{{Main|Abundance of the chemical elements}}
Assuming the mass of ordinary matter is about {{val|1.45|e=53|u=kg}} (refer to previous section) and assuming all atoms are [[hydrogen atom]]s (which in reality make up about 74% of all atoms in our galaxy by mass, see [[Abundance of the chemical elements]]), calculating the estimated total number of atoms in the observable universe is straightforward. Divide the mass of ordinary matter by the mass of a hydrogen atom ({{val|1.45|e=53|u=kg}} divided by {{val|1.67|e=-27|u=kg}}). The result is approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt; hydrogen atoms.

==Most distant objects==
{{main|List of the most distant astronomical objects}}
The most distant [[astronomical object]] yet announced as of 2016 is a galaxy classified [[GN-z11]]. In 2009, a [[gamma ray burst]], [[GRB 090423]], was found to have a [[redshift]] of 8.2, which indicates that the collapsing star that caused it exploded when the universe was only 630 million years old.&lt;ref name="NASAGRB"&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2009/28apr_grbsmash/ New Gamma-Ray Burst Smashes Cosmic Distance Record – NASA Science].

Universetoday.com (2009-10-28). Retrieved on 2011-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; so a distance of about 13 billion light-years was widely quoted in the media (or sometimes a more precise figure of 13.035 billion light-years),&lt;ref name="NASAGRB" /&gt; though this would be the "light travel distance" (''see'' [[Distance measures (cosmology)]]) rather than the "[[Comoving and proper distances#Uses of the proper distance|proper distance]]" used in both [[Hubble's law]] and in defining the size of the observable universe (cosmologist [[Edward L. Wright|Ned Wright]] argues against the common use of light travel distance in astronomical press releases on [http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/Dltt_is_Dumb.html this page], and at the bottom of the page offers online calculators that can be used to calculate the current proper distance to a distant object in a flat universe based on either the redshift ''z'' or the light travel time). The proper distance for a redshift of 8.2 would be about 9.2 [[Megaparsecs|Gpc]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Meszaros, Attila |display-authors=etal |journal=Baltic Astronomy |volume=18 |title=Impact on cosmology of the celestial anisotropy of the short gamma-ray bursts |pages=293–296 |date=2009 |arxiv=1005.1558 |bibcode=2009BaltA..18..293M }}&lt;/ref&gt; or about 30 billion light-years. Another record-holder for most distant object is a galaxy observed through and located beyond [[Abell 2218]], also with a light travel distance of approximately 13 billion light-years from Earth, with observations from the [[Hubble telescope]] indicating a redshift between 6.6 and 7.1, and observations from [[W.

==Horizons==
{{Main|List of cosmological horizons}}
The limit of observability in our universe is set by a set of cosmological horizons which limit—based on various physical constraints—the extent to which we can obtain information about various events in the universe. The most famous horizon is the [[particle horizon]] which sets a limit on the precise distance that can be seen due to the finite [[age of the universe]]. Additional horizons are associated with the possible future extent of observations (larger than the particle horizon owing to the [[expansion of space]]), an "optical horizon" at the [[Cosmic microwave background|surface of last scattering]], and associated horizons with the surface of last scattering for [[cosmic neutrino background|neutrinos]] and [[gravitational wave background|gravitational waves]].

The '''Orapa Power Station''' is a [[Peaking power plant|Peak load power generation plant]] located in the mining town of [[Orapa]] in northeastern [[Botswana]] in the [[Central District (Botswana)|Central District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=4&amp;aid=587&amp;dir=2011/October/Monday10/|title=Mmegi Online :: Orapa power plant to be finally launched|work=Mmegi Online|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is built within the [[Debswana|Debswana Diamond Company Ltd]] [[Orapa diamond mine]] [[lease|fenced leased area]] and is operated by the [[Botswana Power Corporation]].


==Background==
The plant construction was initiated when [[Botswana]] started experiencing electricity supply challenges from year '''2007''' when demand for electricity in the [[country]] started exceeding the county's electricity generation capacity leading to forced periodic nation wide [[Rolling_blackout|load shedding]] excises by the [[Botswana Power Corporation]]. The plant was a short term response to the mining industry electricity requirements&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=4&amp;aid=5796&amp;dir=2010/October/Friday22 Developers of Orapa's 90MW push for 60 % cost reduction]&lt;/ref&gt; prior to the development of Mmamabula and Morupule B power stations.

The plant site is located next to an [[electrical substation]] through which it connects to the [[Electrical grid|national grid]] and was designed to use either [[natural gas]] or [[Diesel_fuel|diesel]] as [[fuel]]. It was commissioned using [[Diesel_fuel|diesel]] with a planned conversion to [[natural gas]] once construction of a [[Pipeline transport|gas pipeline]] from nearby [[Coalbed methane|gas fields]] was complete and commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundaystandard.info/kalahari-energy-convert-diesel-orapa-power-plant-cbm-operation Kalahari Energy to convert diesel Orapa Power Plant to CBM operation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==
The plant consists of two 45MW [[GE LM6000]] Sprint [[Simple_cycle_combustion_turbine|Simple Cycle]] [[gas turbines]] fueled using [[Diesel_fuel|diesel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundaystandard.info/bpc-gets-orapa-90mw-power-station|title=BPC gets Orapa 90MW Power Station {{!}} Sunday Standard|website=www.sundaystandard.info|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy produced is transferred to the [[Electrical grid|national grid]] via the interconnected Orapa Substation by use of two short [[Electric power transmission|132kV overhead power lines]].

The '''sociology of space''' is a sub-discipline of [[sociology]] that mostly borrows from theories developed within the discipline of [[geography]], including the sub fields of [[human geography]], [[economic geography]], and [[feminist geography]]. The "sociology" of space examines the social and material constitution of spaces. It is concerned with understanding the social practices, institutional forces, and material complexity of how humans and spaces interact. The sociology of space is an inter-disciplinary area of study, drawing on various theoretical traditions including [[Marxism]], [[postcolonialism]], and [[Science and Technology Studies]], and overlaps and encompasses theorists with various academic disciplines such as [[geography]] and [[architecture]].  Edward T. Hall developed the study of [[Proxemics]] which concentrates on the empirical analysis of space in psychology.  

== Definition of space ==
Space is one of the most important concepts within the disciplines of social science as it is fundamental to our understanding of geography. The term "space" has been defined variously by scholars:

In general terms, the Oxford English Dictionary defines space in two ways;

1. A continuous extension viewed with or without reference to the existence of objects within it.  
2. The interval between points or objects viewed as having one, two or three dimensions.

However, the human geographers’ interest is in the objects within the space and their relative position, which involves the description, explanation and prediction of the distribution of phenomena. Thus, the relationships between objects in space is the central of the study.

[[Michel Foucault]] defines space as;
“The space in which we live, which draws us out of ourselves, in which the erosion of our lives, our time and our history occurs, the space that claws and gnaws at us, is also, in itself, a heterogeneous space…..we live inside a set of relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kham|first=Miriam|title=Tahiti Intertwined: Ancestral Land, Tourist Postcard, and Nuclear Test Site|journal=American Anthropologist|date=March 2000|volume= 102| issue = 1|series=New Series|pages=7–26|jstor=683535|doi=10.1525/aa.2000.102.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nigel Thrift]] also defines space as;
"The outcome of a series of highly problematic temporary settlements that divide and connect things up into different kinds of collectives which are slowly provided with the meaning which render them durable and sustainable." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thrift|first=Nigel|title=Key Concept in Geography|year=2003|location=London; SAGE|pages=95–107|editor=Sarah L. Hollaway |editor2=Stephen P. Rice |editor3=Gill Valentine|chapter=Space: The Fundamental Stuff of Human Geography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, "space" is the social space in which we live and create relationships with other people, societies and surroundings. Space is an outcome of the hard and continuous work of building up and maintaining collectives by bringing different things into alignments. All kinds of different spaces can and therefore do exist which may or may not relate to each other. Thus, through space, we can understand more about social action.

== History of the sociology of space ==

[[Georg Simmel]] has been seen as the classical sociologist who was most important to this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation   | last1 = Urry | first1 = John | contribution = The Sociology of Space and Place  | series = Blackwell companion to sociology | pages = 5 | year = 2004|isbn=1-4051-2267-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simmel wrote on "the sociology of space" in his 1908 book "Sociology: Investigations on the Forms of Sociation". His concerns included the process of metropolitanisation and the separation of leisure spaces in modern economic societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Theory and Method |last=Jary| first=David |url =http://www.reading.ac.uk/RevSoc/archive/volume10/number1/10-1b.htm | year=1997 |accessdate =2010-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The category of [[space]] long played a subordinate role in sociological theory formation. Only in the late 1980s did it come to be realised that certain changes in society cannot be adequately explained without taking greater account of the spatial components of life. This shift in perspective is referred to as the [[topological turn]]. The space concept directs attention to organisational forms of juxtaposition. The focus is on differences between places and their mutual influence. This applies equally for the micro-spaces of everyday life and the macro-spaces at the nation-state or global levels.

The theoretical basis for the growing interest of the social sciences in space was set primarily by English and French-speaking sociologists, philosophers, and human geographers. Of particular importance is [[Michel Foucault| Michel Foucault’s]] essay on “Of Other Spaces”,&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel (1991, orig. 1967), »Andere Räume«, in: Wentz, Martin (Hg.), Stadt-Räume, Frankfurt a. M./New York, S. 65–72&lt;/ref&gt; in which the author proclaims the “age of space”, and [[Henri Lefebvre| Henri Lefebvre’s]] seminal work “La production de l’espace”.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, Henri (1991, orig. 1974), The Production of Space, D. Nicholson-Smith trans., Oxford: Basil Blackwell, {{ISBN|0-631-14048-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter provided the grounding for Marxist spatial theory on which [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], [[Manuel Castells]], [[Edward Soja]], and others have built. Marxist theories of space, which are predicated on a structural, i.e., capitalist or global determinants of spaces and the growing homogenization of space, are confronted by action theoretical conceptions, which stress the importance of the corporeal placing and the perception of spaces as albeit habitually predetermined but subjective constructions. One example is the theory of space of the German sociologist [[Martina Löw]].&lt;ref&gt;Löw, Martina (2001), Raumsoziologie, Frankfurt a. M.&lt;/ref&gt; Approaches deriving from the [[Postcolonialism|post-colonialism]] discourse have attracted greater attention in recent years. Also in contrast to (neo)Marxist concepts of space, British geographer [[Doreen Massey (geographer)|Doreen Massey]]&lt;ref&gt;Massey, Doreen (1999a), Power-Geometries and the Politics of Space-Time, Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massey, Doreen (1999b), »Spaces of Politics«, in: Massey, Doreen/Allen, John/Sarre, Philip (Hg.), Human Geography Today, Cambridge/Oxford/Malden, S. 279–294&lt;/ref&gt; and German sociologist [[Helmuth Berking]],&lt;ref&gt;Berking, Helmuth (1998), »›Global Flows and Local Cultures‹. Über die Rekonfiguration sozialer Räume im Globalisierungsprozeß«, in: Berliner Journal für Soziologie, 8, 3, S. 381–392&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, emphasise the heterogeneity of local contexts and the place-relatedness of our knowledge about the world.

== Duality of space ==

[[Martina Löw]] developed the idea of a "relational" model of space, which focuses on the “orderings”&lt;ref&gt;Löw, Martina (2008), »The Constitution of Space: The Structuration of Spaces Through the Simultaneity of Effects and Perception«, in: European Journal of Social Theory, 1, 11&lt;/ref&gt; of living entities and social goods, and examines how space is constituted in processes of perception, recall, or ideation to manifest itself as societal structure. From a social theory point of view, it follows on from the theory of structuration proposed by [[Anthony Giddens]],&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1984), The Constitution of Society. Outline of the Theory of Structuration. Cambridge: Polity&lt;/ref&gt; whose concept of the “duality of structure” Löw extends sociological terms into a “duality of space.” The basic idea is that individuals act as social agents (and constitute spaces in the process), but that their action depends on economic, legal, social, cultural, and, finally, spatial structures. Spaces are hence the outcome of action. At the same time, spaces structure action, that is to say spaces can both constrain and enable action.

With respect to the constitution of space, Löw distinguishes analytically between two, generally mutually determining factors: “spacing” and “synthesis.” Spacing refers to the act of placing or the state of being placed of social goods and people in places. According to Löw, however, an ordering created through placings is only effectively constituted as space where the elements that compose it are actively interlinked by people – in processes of perception, ideation, or recall. Löw calls this synthesis. This concept has been empirically tested in studies such as those by [[Lars Meier]] (who examined the constitution of space in the everyday life of financial managers in London and Singapore), [[Cedric Janowicz]] (who carried out an ethnographical-space sociological study of food supply in the Ghanaian city of [[Accra]]), and [[Silke Streets]] (who looked at processes of space constitution in the creative industries in Leipzig).

== Marxist approaches ==

The most important proponent of Marxist spatial theory was [[Henri Lefebvre]]. He proposed "social space" to be where the [[relations of production]] are reproduced and that dialectical contradictions were spatial rather than temporal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lefebvre, Henri | title=The Survival of Capitalism: Reproduction of the Relations of Production | publisher=Allison &amp; Busby | year=1973 | isbn=0-85031-173-X}}, p17-19&lt;/ref&gt; Lefèbvre sees the societal production of space as a dialectical interaction between three factors. Space is constituted:

* by “spatial practice,” meaning space as reproduced in everyday life
* by the “representation of space”, meaning space as developed cognitively
* and by “spaces of representation,” by which Lefebvre means complex symbolisations and ideational spaces.

In Lefebvre’s view of the 1970s, this spatial production resulted in a space of non-reflexive everydayness marked by alienation, dominating through mathematical-abstract concepts of space, and reproduced in spatial practice. Lefebvre sees a line of flight from alienated spatiality in the spaces of representation – in notions of non-alienated, mythical, pre-modern, or artistic visions of space.

Marxist spatial theory was given decisive new impetus by [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], in particular, who was interested in the effects of the transition from [[Fordism]] to “flexible accumulation” on the experience of space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David (1989), The Condition of Postmodernity, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; He shows how various innovations at the economic and technological levels have breached the crisis-prone inflexibility of the Fordist system, thus increasing the turnover rate of capital. This causes a general acceleration of economic cycles. According to Harvey, the result is “time-space compression.” While the feeling for the long term, for the future, for continuity is lost, the relationship between proximity and distance becomes more and more difficult to determine.

== Postcolonial theories of space ==

Theories of space that are inspired by the [[Postcolonialism|post-colonialism]] discourse focus on the heterogeneity of spaces. According to [[Doreen Massey (geographer)|Doreen Massey]], calling a country in Africa a “developing country” is not appropriate, since this expression implies that spatial difference is temporal difference (Massey 1999b). This logic treats such a country not as different but merely as an early version of countries in the “developed” world, a view she condemns as "Eurocentrism." In this vein, [[Helmuth Berking]] criticises theories that postulate the increasing homogenisation of the world through globalisation as “globocentrism.” He confronts this with the distinctiveness and importance of local knowledge resources for the production of (different and specific) places. He claims that local contexts form a sort of framework or filter through which global processes and globally circulating images and symbols are appropriated, thus attaining meaning. For instance, the film character [[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]] is a different figure in radical rightwing circles in Germany than in the black ghettoes of the Chicago Southside, just as [[McDonald’s]] means something different in Moscow than in Paris.

== Third Space ==
[[Henri Lefebvre]] (see also [[Edward Soja]]) says that (social) space is a (social) product, or a complex social construction (based on values, and the social production of meanings) which affects spatial practices and perceptions. He explains space embraces a multitude of intersection in his great book, “Production of Space”. That means that we need to consider how the various modes of spatial production relate to each other.

He argues that there are three aspects to our spatial existence, which exist in a kind of triad:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lefebvre|first=Henri|title=Marxist &amp; Social Constructivist Approaches to Place|url=http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~janzb/courses/hum3930b/lefebvre1.htm|publisher=Pegasus|accessdate=2013-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. First Space
(Physical space/perceived space)
"The spatial practice of a society secretes that society's space; it propounds and presupposes it, in a dialectical interaction; it produces it slowly and surely as it masters and appropriates it."

2. Second Space
(Mental space/conceived space)
"Conceptualized space, the space of scientists, planners, urbanists, technocratic subdividers and social engineers, as of a certain type of artist with a scientific bent -- all of whom identify what is lived and what is perceived with what is conceived."

3. Third Space
(Social space/lived space)
"Space as directly lived through its associated images and symbols."

Even though there are many disciplines in the study of Human Geography, the most well-known approach is “The third space” formulated by [[Edward Soja]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=J. Smith|first=Susan|title=Introducing Human Geographies|year=1999|publisher=Arnold|location=London|pages=12–22|chapter=Society-Space|editor=Paul Cloke |editor2=Philip Crang |editor3=Mark Goodwin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In unitary theory, there are three approaches; first space, second space and third space. First space is physical space, and spaces are measurable and mappable. The second space is a mental or conceived space which comes from our thinking and ideas. However, the third space is a social space/lived space which is a social product that is a space created by society under oppression or marginalization that want to reclaim the space of inequality and make it into something else. Soja argues that our old ways to thinking about space (first and second space theories) can no longer accommodate the way the world works because he believed that spaces may not be contained within one social category, they may include different aspects of many categories or developed within the boundaries of a number of category. For instance, two different cultures combine together and emerge as a third culture. This third hybrid space displaces the original values that constitute it and set up new values and perspectives that is different from the first two spaces. Thus, the third space theory can explain some of the complexity of poverty, social exclusion and social inclusion, gender and race issues.

== Rational view of space ==
In the work of geographer and critical theorist [[Nigel Thrift]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thrift|first=Nigel|title=Key Concept in Geography|year=2003|location=London; SAGE|pages=95–107|editor=Sarah L. Hollaway |editor2=Stephen P. Rice |editor3=Gill Valentine|chapter=Space: The Fundamental Stuff of Human Geography}}&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote a rational view of space in which, rather than seeing space being viewed as a container within which the world proceeds, space should be seen as a co-product of these proceedings. He explained about four constructed space in modern human geography. 
There are four different kinds of space according to how modern geography thinks about space. They are 1. Empirical Construction of Space, 2. Unblocking space, 3. Image space and 4. Place Space.

'''First Space''' is the empirical construction of space. Empirical space refers to the process whereby the mundane fabric of daily life is constructed. These simple things like, cars, houses, mobiles, computers and roads are very simple but they are great achievements of our daily life and they play very important role in making up who we are today. For example, today’s technology such as GPS did not suddenly come into existence; in fact, it is laid down in the 18th century and developed throughout time. The first space is real and tangible, and it is also known as physical space.
'''Second space''' is the unblocking space. This type of space refers to the process whereby routine pathways of interaction as set up around which boundaries are often drawn. The routine may include the movement of office workers, the interaction of drunk teenagers, and the flow of goods, money, people, and information. Unlike the old time in geography when people accepted a space as blocked boundary (Example: A capitalist space, neoliberal space or city space), we began to realize that there is no such thing like boundaries in space. The space of the world is flowing and transforming continuously that it is very difficult to describe in a fixed way. The second space is ideology/conceptual and it is also known as mental space. For example, the second space will explain the behaviors of people from different social class and the social segregation among rich and poor people. 
'''Third space''' is the image space that refers to the process whereby the images has produced new kind of space. The images may be in different form and shape; ranging from painting to photograph, from portrait to post card, and from religious theme to entertainment. Nowadays, we are highly influenced by images in many ways and these certain images can tell us new social and cultures values, or something new about how we see the world. Images, symbols and sign do have some kind of spatial expression. 
'''Fourth space''' is the place that refers to the process whereby spaces are ordered in ways that open up affective and other embodied potentials. Place space has more meaning than a place, and it can represent as different type of space. This fourth type of space tries to understand that place is a vital actor in bringing up people's lives in certain ways and place will let us to understand all kind of things which are hidden form us..

==Scale: the local and the global==
Andrew Herod &lt;ref&gt;Harod, A. 2003. "Scale: the local and the global".  Key Concepts in Geography. London: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned that scale, within human geography, is typically seen in one of the two ways: either as a real material thing which actually exists and is the result of political struggle and/or social process, or as a way of framing our understanding of the world. People’s lives across the globe have been re-scaling by contemporary economic, political, cultural and social processes, such as [[globalization]], in complex ways. As a result, we have seen the creation of [[supra-national]] political bodies such as the [[European Union]], the devolution of political power from the nation-state to regional political bodies.&lt;ref&gt;PoliticalGeography. 1997. Special Issue on " The political geography of scale".Political Geography.&lt;/ref&gt; We have also experienced the increasing homogenization and ‘[[Americanization]]’ through the process of globalization while the locals’ tendencies (or counter force)among people who defend traditional ways of life increase around the world .The process of re-scaling people‘s lives and the relationship between the two extremes of our scaled lives- the ‘global’ and the ‘local’ were brought into question.

===Ontological status of the global and the local===
Until the 1980s, theorizing the concept of ‘scale’ itself was taken for granted although physical and human geographers looked at issues from ‘regional scale’ or‘national scale’. The questions such as whether scale is simply a mental device categorizing and ordering the world or whether scales really exists as material social products, particularly, were debated among [[materialists]] and [[idealists]]. Some geographers draw upon Immanuel Kant’s idealist philosophy that scales were handy conceptual mechanism for ordering the world while others, by drawing upon Marxist ideas of materialism, argue that scales really exist in the world and they were the real social products. For those idealists based on Kantian‘s inspiration, the ‘global’ is defined by the geologically given limits of the earth and the ‘local’ is defined as a spatial resolution useful for comprehending the process and practices. For materialists, the ‘national’ scale is a scale that had to be actively created through economic and political processes but not a scale existed in a logical hierarchy between global and the regional.

The notion of ‘becoming’ and the focus on the politics of producing scales have been central to materialist&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, P.J. 1982. "A materialist framework for political geography", Transactions, Institute of British Geographers.&lt;/ref&gt; arguments concerning the global scale. It is important to recognize that social actors may have to work just as hard to become ‘local’as they have to work to become ‘global’. People paid attention to how transnational corporations have ‘gone global’, how institutions of governance have‘become’ supra-national and how labour unions have sought to ‘globalize’ their operations to match those of an increasingly ‘globalized’ city.

For the scale ‘global’ and ‘local’, Kevin Cox mentioned that moving from the local to the global scale ‘is not a movement from one discrete arena to another’ but a process of developing networks of associations that allow actors to shift between various spaces of engagement. According to his view, ‘scale’ is seen as a process rather than as a fixed entity and, in other words, the global and the local are not static ’arenas’within which social life plays out but are constantly made by social actions.For example, a political organization might attempt to go ‘global’ to engage with actors or opportunities outside of its own space; likewise, a transnational corporation may attempt to ‘go local’ through tailoring its products and operations in different places.

===Discourses of the global and the local===
[[J. K. Gibson-Graham|Gibson-Graham]]&lt;ref&gt;Gibson-Graham, J.K. 2002. "Beyond global vs. local: economic politics outside the binary frame" in: A. Herold and M.W. Wright(eds) . Geographies of Power: Placing Scale. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; (2002) has identified at least six ways in which the relationship between the local and the global is often viewed.

1. The global and the local are seen as interpretive frames for analyzing situations

2. Drawing on Dirlik, Gibson-Graham suggests that in such a representation, the global is ‘something more than the national or regional ..anything other than the local’. Meaning that, the global and the local each derive meaning from what they are not.

3. According to French social theorist [[Bruno Latour]], the local and the global ‘offer different points of view on networks that are by nature neither local nor global, but are more or less long and more or less connected. Also, in Latour’s view, it is impossible to distinguish where the local ends and the global begins.

4. The concept ‘The global is local’ was proposed by Gibson-Graham. For instance, multinational firms are actually ‘multi local‘ rather than ‘global’.

5. The local is global. In this view, the local is an entry point to the world of global flows which encircle the planet.

6. The global and the local are actually the processes rather than the locations. All spaces are the hybrids of global and local; so they are ‘glocal.’

There are some western thoughts that greater size and extensiveness imply domination and superior power, such that the local is often represented as ‘small and relatively powerless, defined and confined by the global’. So, the global is a force and the local is its field of play. However, the local can serve as a powerful scale of political organization; the global is not a scale just controlled by capital – those who challenge capital can also organize globally( Herod, A). There has been the concept ‘Think globally and act locally’ viewed by [[neoliberals]].

===Metaphors of scale===
For representing how the world is scaled, there are five different and popular metaphors: they are the ladder, concentric circles, Matryoshka nesting dolls, earthworm burrows and tree roots. First, in using such a metaphor of hierarchical ladder, the global as the highest rung on the ladder is seen to be above the local and all other scales. Second, the use of concentric metaphor leaves us with a particular way of conceptualizing the scalar relationship between places. In this second metaphor, the local is seen as a relatively small circle, with the regional as a larger circle encompassing it, while the national and the global scales are still larger circles encompassing the local and the regional. For the hierarchy of Russian Matryoshka nesting dolls, the global can contain other scales but this does not work the other way round; for instance, the local cannot contain the global. For the fourth metaphor concerning with thinking on scale, what French social theorist [[Bruno Latour]] argued is that a world of places is ‘networked’ together. Such the metaphor leaves us with an image of scale in which the global and the local are connected together and not totally separated from each other.  For the tree roots metaphor similar with the earthworm burrow metaphor, as the earthworm burrows or tree roots penetrating different strata of the soil, it is difficult to determine exactly where one scale ends and another begins. When thinking about the use of metaphor, it should be aware that the choice of metaphor over another is not made on the basis of which is empirically a ‘more accurate’representation of something but, on the basis of how someone is attempting to understand a particular phenomenon.

Such an appreciation of metaphors is important because it suggests that how we talk about scale impacts upon the ways in which we engage socially and politically with our scaled world and that may impact on how we conduct our social, economic and political praxis and so make landscapes ( Herod,A&lt;ref&gt;Herod, A., Wright, M.W (eds). 2002. Geographies of Power: Placing Scale. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; )

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1050">The '''streaming vibration current''' ('''SVI''') and the associated '''streaming vibration potential''' is an [[electric]] signal that arises when an [[acoustic wave]] propagates through a porous body in which the pores are filled with fluid.

Streaming vibration current was experimentally observed in 1948 by M. Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, M. "An Electrokinetic Transducer" The review of scientific instruments, 19, 10, 640–646, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; A theoretical model was developed some 30 years later by Dukhin and coworkers.&lt;ref&gt;Dukhin, S.S., Mischuk, N.A., Kuz’menko, B.B and Il’in, B.I. "Flow current and potential in a high-frequency acoustic field" Colloid J., 45, 5, 875–881,1983&lt;/ref&gt; This effect opens another possibility for characterizing the electric properties of the surfaces in porous bodies.
