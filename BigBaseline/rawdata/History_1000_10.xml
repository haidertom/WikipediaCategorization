      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19835">The World Monuments Watch is a flagship advocacy program of the [[New York City|New York]]-based private [[non-profit organization]] [[World Monuments Fund]] (WMF) and [[American Express]] to call to action and challenge government authorities responsible for important cultural resources to identify sites immediately at risk, and to stimulate public awareness of the tremendous need to [[Historic preservation|preserve]] and create sustainable uses for significant [[cultural heritage|heritage made by man]].&lt;ref name=1998_press_release&gt;{{cite web | title = Palpung named to list of endangered monuments | date=September 1997 | publisher = World Monuments Fund | url = http://www.asianart.com/cers/palpung/palpwmw.html|accessdate=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=1998_official&gt;{{cite web | title = 1998 World Monuments Watch | publisher = World Monuments Fund | url = http://www.wmf.org/pdf/Watch_Catalog_1998.pdf|accessdate=8 September 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection process==
Every two years, the program publishes a select list known as the Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites that is in urgent need of preservation funding and protection. The sites are nominated by public authorities, local preservation groups, and qualified individuals.&lt;ref name=1998_official /&gt; An independent panel of international experts then select 100 candidates from these entries to be part of the Watch List, based on the significance of the site's overall significance, the urgency of its situation, the viability of action plans to save it, and the ability of a local constituency to sustainably maintain the site in the future with the means to do so.&lt;ref name=1998_press_release /&gt; WMF and American Express award grants to sites included on the Watch List. In addition, the leverage from the listing spurs government agencies and local donors to allocate funds and take an active role in protecting the cultural landmark.&lt;ref name=1998_official /&gt;

==1998 Watch List==
The 1998 World Monuments Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites was launched on September 8, 1997, by WMF President [[Bonnie Burnham]].&lt;ref name=1998_official /&gt;

The technical knowledge of the Ahmarian culture, along with the other lithic industries, is considered the likely source of the abrupt and rapid takeover of the world in all directions as evidenced by the crossing of the [[Bering Strait]] towards America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gobekli Tepe: An Introduction to the World's Oldest Temple (Revised Edition)|last=Bachenheimer|first=Avi|publisher=Blurb, Incorporated|year=2016|isbn=9781366700940|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=19-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmarian technology, which included the complex of blade/bladelet-knapping techniques is also linked to the tools used by the [[Hunter-gatherer|hunter-gatherers]] of south-western Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Humanity: Prehistory and the beginnings of civilization|last=De Laet|first=S.J.|last2=Dani|first2=A.H.|last3=Lorenzo|first3=J.L.|last4=Nunoo|first4=R.B.|publisher=Routledge|year=1994|isbn=0415093058|location=London|pages=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Annales Ceccanenses''''', also called the '''''Chronicon Fossae novae''''', is a chronicle of [[world history]] from the [[birth of Jesus]] down to 1218. It was a written in the late twelfth and early thirteenth century by an anonymous monk of [[Fossanova Abbey]], near [[Ceccano]]. It is partially dependent on the ''[[Annales Cavenses]]'' and ''[[Annales Casinenses]]'', and contains no original material prior to the year 1120. After that it is a valuable source for the history of the [[Papacy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Auguste Molinier]], [https://www-persee-fr.bibliopam-evry.univ-evry.fr/web/ouvrages/home/prescript/article/shf_0000-0000_1903_num_3_1_919_t1_0021_0000_6# "2289.

'''Anno Lucis''' (“in the Year of Light”) is a dating system used in [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] ceremonial or commemorative proceedings, which is equivalent to the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian year]] plus 4000. It is similar to ''[[Anno Mundi]]''.

==Description==

'''Antiquization''' ([[Macedonian Language|Macedonian]]: антиквизација), sometimes also '''ancient Macedonism''' ([[Macedonian Language |Macedonian]]: антички македонизам), is a term used mainly to critically describe the [[Identity politics|identity policies]] conducted by the [[Macedonian nationalism|nationalist]] [[VMRO-DPMNE]]-led governments of the [[Republic of Macedonia]] in the period between 2006 and 2017. In the contemporary Macedonian discourse, antiquization refers to the identitarian policies based on the assumption that there is a direct link between today's [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonians]] and [[Ancient Macedonians]].&lt;ref name="Vangeli13"&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The recent politics of history therefore not only embrace the recollection of the alleged ancient heritage of the Ancient Macedonians, i.e. the heritage of [[Philip II of Macedon | Philip II]] and his son [[Alexander the Great]], but also seek to depict a coherent continuity of history from the ancient [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Kingdom of Macedon]] until the modern Republic of Macedonia in order to reveal the uniqueness of the modern Macedonians and their country. This continuous and supposedly linear historiography includes the assertion that the modern ethnic Macedonians are direct descendants of the Ancient Macedonians. The expression “antiquization” originates from the history of arts and describes "the Renaissance practice of giving a city the appearance of ancient Rome or Athens through the introduction of structures organized in the classical mode".&lt;ref&gt;Tzonis, Alexander; Lefaivre, Liane (1987): Das Klassische in der Architektur: die Poetik der Ordnung.

==Narrative referred to as 'antiquization'==
The narrative promoted by VMRO-DPMNE goes back to the ancient [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom) | Kingdom of Macedon]], continues with personalities from [[early Christianity]], distinguished historical figures who were born in or ruled in or around [[Skopje]] and also embraces a group of freedom fighters who struggled for Macedonian independence.&lt;ref name=Muhic141&gt;Muhić, Maja; Takovski, Aleksandar (2014): Redefining National Identity in Macedonia. Analyzing Competing Origins Myths and Interpretations through Hegemonic Representations. In ''Etnološka tribina'' 44 (37), p 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient times [[Philip II of Macedon]] was the first who united the [[Polis|Greek city-states]] and created the basis for the [[Macedonia_(ancient_kingdom)#Empire|great empire]] which, later on, was expanded by his son, Alexander III of Macedon, also known as [[Alexander the Great]]. Alexander's empire is regarded as being important for the spread of [[Hellenistic_period#Culture|Hellenistic culture]], arts and sciences in considerable parts of Europe, Asia and northern Africa. [[Ancient_Macedonians#Modern_discourse|Modern scholarly discourse has produced several hypotheses about the Macedonians' place within the Greek world]], about whether the [[Ancient Macedonians]] were [[Greeks]] and whether the [[Ancient Macedonian language]] was a form of the [[Greek language]] or related to it. In parts of the available ancient literature they are described as a [[List of ancient Greek tribes|Greek tribe]], in others the Ancient Macedonians were regarded as [[barbarian]]s by the Athenians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burn|first1=Andrew|title=Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic Empire|date=1991|publisher=Ams Pr Inc|isbn=0404200486|page=4|quote=Macedonian kings were proud of their Greek blood, and it was only jaundiced opponents like Demosthenes the Athenian who ventured to call them 'barbarians.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Errington|first1=R. Malcolm|title=A History of Macedonia|date=1990|publisher=University of California Press|page=4|quote=Ancient allegations that the Macedonians were non-Greek all had their origin in Athens at the time of the struggle with Philip II. Then as now, political struggle created the prejudice. The orator Aeschines once even found it necessary, in order to counteract the prejudice vigorously fomented by his opponents, to defend Philip on this issue and describe him at a meeting of the Athenian Popular Assembly as being 'entirely Greek'. Demosthenes' allegations were lent an appearance of credibility by the fact, apparent to every observer, that the life-style of the Macedonians, being determined by specific geographical and historical conditions, was different from that of a Greek city-state. This alien way of life was, however, common to western Greeks of Epirus, Akarnania and Aitolia, as well as to the Macedonians, and their fundamental Greek nationality was never doubted. Only as a consequence of the political disagreement with Macedonia was the issue raised at all.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who were gradually [[Hellenization|Hellenized]].&lt;ref&gt;Papavizas, G. C. (2010): FYROM: Searching for a Name, and Problems with the Expropriation of History. In ''Mediterranean Quarterly'' 21 (3), pp. 86–103.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no doubt about Philip II being the one who united most of the Greek states and Alexander the Great being a world-famous conqueror, perceived as a [[hero]] of this ancient period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burger|first1=Michael|title=The Shaping of Western Civilization: From Antiquity to the Enlightenment|date=2008|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=1551114321|page=76|quote=In the end, the Greeks would fall under the rule of a single man, who would unify Greece: Philip II, king of Macedon (360-336 BC). His son, Alexander the Great, would lead the Greeks on a conquest of the ancient Near East vastly expanding the Greek world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Philip II of Macedonia: Greater than Alexander|first1=Richard A.|title=Philip II of Macedonia: Greater than Alexander|date=2010|publisher=Potomac Books|isbn=1597975192|page=232|quote=That sense of being one people allowed each Greek state and its citizens to contribute their values, experiences, traditions, resources, and talents to a new national identity and psyche. It was not until Philip's reign that a common sentiment of what it meant to be a Hellene reached all Greeks. Alexander took this culture of Hellenism with him to Asia, but it was Philip, as leader of the Greeks, who created it and in doing so made the Hellenistic Age possible.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vilho Harle, ''Ideas of Social Order in the Ancient World'', Greenwood Press, 1998, p.24: "The idea of the city-state was first challenged by the ideal of pan-Hellenic unity supported by some writers and orators, among which the Athenian Isocrates became a leading proponent with his Panegyrics of 380 suggesting a Greek holy war against Persia. However, only the rise of Macedonia made the realization of pan-Hellenic unity possible."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the narrative brought forward by the VMRO-DPMNE, Alexander the Great was clearly not a Greek. According to this version of history, most of the cultural achievements which are perceived as being from Greek origin by historians and laypersons around the world are actually ethnic Macedonian achievements. Therefore, in the view of some, [[Hellenistic period|Hellenism]]’s true name would actually be Macedonianism. The Republic of Macedonia would thus be the owner of great cultural heritage, which always had been denied by the world. And as the then [[Prime Minister of the Republic of Macedonia]] [[Nikola Gruevski]] put it, it can finally present its true history that has been silenced for so long. Macedonia, in this view is seen as the cradle of [[Culture of Europe|European civilization]].&lt;ref name=Kubiena88&gt;Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern Macedonian narrative, it is no contradiction that modern [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] speak the [[Macedonian language]], a [[South Slavic languages|southern Slavic language]]. It is a considerable consensus in historical sciences that [[Slavs | Slavic people]] immigrated into the [[Balkans]] and the region of [[Macedonia (region) | Macedonia]] around the 6th century. From a modern Macedonian perspective, the Slavic people assimilated to the [[Indigenous peoples|autochthonous population]], who were direct descendants of the [[Ancient Macedonians]], and intermingled with other local groups. For some reason Slavic languages remained dominant, but according to this historical narrative this cannot be understood as a clue for modern Macedonians being of Slavic descent. Rather, they are descendants from several local groups, one of which were the Ancient Macedonians.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Similar conflicts or diverging perspectives on the true course of history emerged around heroic Slavic-speaking figures from the geographic region Macedonia who fought against the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]], like [[Dame Gruev]] and [[Gotse Delchev]]. But did these people fight for freedom and an independent Macedonian state? Or did they fight for independence from the Ottoman Empire in order to include this area into a [[Greater Bulgaria]]? Similarly to [[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]] and other Balkan states see Macedonia presenting supposedly Macedonian heroes, which they actually claim to be Bulgarian or respectively Greek.&lt;ref name=Georgievski&gt;Georgievski, Boris (2009): Ghosts of the Past Endanger Macedonia's Future: Balkan Insight. BalkanInsight. Available online at http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/ghosts-of-the-past-endanger-macedonia-s-future, checked on 3/12/2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern Macedonian narrative, these people evidently fought for an independent Macedonian state with a Macedonian nation and identity that is clearly distinctive to the Slavic [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian identity]]. In this narrative there is little to no space for the impact of more than five hundred years of Ottoman rule in the region. And also the time under the rule of [[Yugoslavia]] is almost left out in VMRO-DPMNE's modern narrative. In the Yugoslav era, the focus was on southern Slavic brotherhood and [[socialism]], which would obscure the supposed non-Slavic background of the Macedonian nation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Examples of 'antiquization'==
Strongly promoted by VMRO-DPMNE politicians, the recollection of Macedonia's heroic past is supported by (pseudo-) scientists, media and civil society efforts. Some historians emphasize the before-mentioned historical continuity;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Vangeli, 2011: 20: “For instance, the newest official “History of the Macedonian People” published by the Institute for National History in 2009, argues that during the interaction of the immigrant Slavs and the native Ancient Macedonians, the ancient features prevailed and defined the development of the region (Ĉepreganov et al.). This resembles a major revision of the Institute’s position, which since its foundation, had argued that after the Great Migration, Slavs imposed their culture in the new lands, thus Macedonian culture was Slavic. Mitko Panov, the major author of the chapters on ancient and medieval history, has published a series of articles (“Antiĉkite Makedonci”; “Vizantiskiot kontinuitet”) stating that Ancient Macedonians “kept on existing as a people, preserving its ethnic hallmarks and traditions” even in the period of the Great Migration, which influenced the “self-identification” of the immigrant Slavs, even the whole Byzantine culture. He has argued that the political “tendency of the historiography in SFRY based (. . .) on the relations between Belgrade and Athens” has produced ignorance towards the obvious continuity of Ancient Macedonians (Panov, “Antiĉkite Makedonci”)”.&lt;/ref&gt; archaeologists and linguists present evidence for the resemblance of the language of the ancient Macedonians and the modern Macedonian – a south Slavic language; genealogists offer the alleged scientific proof of the similarity of the DNS of ancient Macedonians and the DNS of the modern Macedonians,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Vangeli, 2011: 20: “Particularly valuable has been the survey by the Swiss project iGenea whose findings were interpreted to prove that “Macedonians have more ancient Macedonian blood” than Greeks, which, on the other hand, have sub-Saharan origin (Aleksovska). While the survey has stirred very positive public reactions, officials have not used it as part of the antiquization process.”; see also: http://www.igenea.com/en/home.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the Greeks have to accept that a blood relationship with the ancient Macedonians cannot be testified.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,31&gt;Brunnbauer, Ulf (2015): Zwischen Eigensinn und Realitätsflucht: "Skopje 2014" als Bau an der Nation.

In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The extensive cultural politics described by “antiquization” not only describe an identitarian narrative promoted by VMRO-DPMNE. It also supports this narrative with the renaming of important public places, the staging of public events, architectural projects and interference in public education. The former City Stadium has been renamed into “[[Philip II Arena |National Arena Philip II of Macedonia]]”. The [[Skopje "Alexander the Great" Airport |airport of Skopje]] is now called “Alexander the Great”, just as one of the main motorways, which is part of the pan-European Corridor Nr. 10. A central square in Skopje bears the name “Pella Square” named after [[Pella]], the capital of the ancient kingdom of Macedon.&lt;ref name=Georgievski /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gori, Maja (2014): Fabricating Identity from Ancient Shards: Construction and Cultural Appropriation in the New Macedonian Question.

In ''Povijest u nastavi'' 10 (19 (1)), pp. 33–44.&lt;/ref&gt; The most explicit, Macedonia's new politics of history become visible in Europe's currently most ambitious urban development project “[[Skopje 2014]]”. The numerous statues which represent supposed Macedonian heroes, the newly erected [[triumphal arch]] Porta Makedonija, the lately constructed buildings for cultural and governmental purposes in [[Baroque Revival architecture|neo-Baroque]] and [[Neoclassical architecture]], the renewed facades of old socialist blocks, the new and the recently redesigned bridges: It all gives the impression of a manifestation of the Macedonian identity politics being carved in stone.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnbauer, Ulf (2015): Zwischen Eigensinn und Realitätsflucht: "Skopje 2014" als Bau an der Nation. In ''OST-WEST Europäische Perspektiven'' 16 (1), pp. 26ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koteska&gt;Koteska, Jasna (2011): Troubles with History: Skopje 2014.

The figures displayed in the project range from [[Alexander the Great]], [[Justinian I]] (Emperor of the Roman [[Byzantine Empire]]), and Christian missionaries of the 1st millennium to revolutionary characters of the late 19th and early 20th century. According to Valentina Bozinovska, chair woman of the state commission for relations with religious communities, "[...] the Skopje 2014 project is a statement of all that we have had from the ancient period until today. For the first time we have a chance to create a tangible manifestation of Macedonian identity. [...] Civilization practically started here".&lt;ref&gt;Diminishkovska, 2010 in: Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The sum paid by the project's main investor VMRO-DPMNE, range, depending on the source, from 80 to 200 million [[Euro]]s. Some critics even predict a total sum up to 500 million Euros. &lt;ref name=Muhic141 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kubiena88 /&gt; 

In addition, new traditions are being (re-)invented in the way that Ancient Macedonian holidays are added or existing holidays expanded with Ancient Macedonian features and/or new ceremonies. &lt;ref name=Vangeli19&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), pp. 19ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example fitting into the antiquization narrative is based on an ethnological study in the [[Hunza Valley]] of [[Pakistan]], situated in the Pakistani part of the [[Himalayas]]. The study revealed that people of the [[Burusho people|Burusho]] tribe maintain the legend of being descendants of soldiers of the army of Alexander the Great, and therefore regard Macedonia as their homeland. As a consequence, in 2008 a delegation of the Hunza royal family visited Macedonia and was “welcomed home” by the Prime Minister, the Archbishop of the Macedonian Orthodox Church, the Mayor of Skopje and a flag-waving crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnwasser, Matthew (2008): Macedonia dispute has an Asian flavor - The New York Times. The New York Times. Available online at https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/world/asia/01iht-macedonia.2.16612068.html, checked on 3/19/2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, as part of a governmental campaign, videos were broadcast that featured Alexander the Great as the liberator of African and Asian people, saying, it is not Macedonian to retreat. On another occasion the movie “[[Macedonian Prayer (video) |Macedonian prayer]]” was broadcast by the state-governed national television at prime time. Being directed by a member of the Diaspora organization [[World Macedonian Congress]], this movie claims that the Macedonians were created by God before anyone else and that they constitute the origin of the [[White people|white race]].&lt;ref name=Vangeli18 /&gt;

Analyses of Macedonian textbooks revealed that the recent politics of history have also influenced the knowledge taught in schools. For instance, this is demonstrated in the way the particularity of the ethnic Macedonians throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Roman era]] is delineated.&lt;ref&gt;Stojanov, Darko (2014): In search of autochthony: A case study of the Great Migration Period as presented in history textbooks in Macedonia. In ''Povijest u nastavi'' 10 (19 (1)), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traces of 'antiquization' in the past==
Macedonian antiquization as it can be observed recently, is regarded as a rather young phenomenon that developed its full potential for political mobilization in the last years, as a substantial element of the political agenda of the ruling party VMRO-DPMNE. Yet, traces of antiquization, albeit not called like this, can be found in the past. Some see the background of antiquization in the 19th and early 20th century and the “myth of ancient descent among Orthodox Slavic speakers in Macedonia, adopted partially due to Greek cultural inputs”.&lt;ref name=Vangeli13&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Macedonian narratives===
Important for endorsing such beliefs were anti-Bulgarian attempts by secular and religious Greek institutions. One of these Greek approaches was the spread of the myth of the origin from Alexander the Great and Ancient Macedonians. Greek priests and academics tried to convince the local Orthodox Slavic-speaking population that they were Macedonians, directly related to Alexander the Great, and, as a result, Greeks. The aim was to persuade these people to turn away from Slavic exertion of influence and to accept the authority of the government in [[Athens]].&lt;ref name=Vangeli15&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In the last quarter of the 19th century in the geographic region called Macedonia, which constituted the last part of the Ottoman Empire on the Balkan Peninsula that still had not gained independence, a serious struggle emerged about the national affiliation of the Christian Slavs. However, the claims of the already independent states [[Principality of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] overlapped considerably, since they all could refer to Macedonia having been part of their correspondent empire during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Boskovska, Nada (2015): Makedonien - ein historischer Überblick. In ''OST-WEST Europäische Perspektiven'' 16 (1), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wherever one might locate the origin of Ancient Macedonian nationhood among parts of the Orthodox Slavic speaking population: national myths inspired by antiquity did not play an important role in any of the events that [[Macedonian historiography]] regards as a milestone of present-day Macedonian state- and nationhood - above all the [[Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising |Ilinden Uprising]] and the [[Kruševo Republic]] in 1903.&lt;ref name=Vangeli15 /&gt; Michael Kubiena states that at the times of the [[Macedonian Struggle]] and the [[Balkan Wars]], considerable parts of the local populations worried more about social and economic stability, than about “dying for nationalisms”.&lt;ref&gt;Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; "Ethnicity was as much the consequence as the cause of this unrest; revolutionary violence produced national affiliations as well as being produced by them".&lt;ref&gt;Mazower, 2000 in: Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, "there have neither been any references towards Alexander the Great or Ancient Macedonia in the iconography and the popular mythology of the interwar platforms for the Macedonian national liberation. As well, they have been absent in the [[Yugoslav Partisans|partisan movement]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and were not referred to in the proclamation of the Macedonian statehood in 1944".&lt;ref name=Vangeli15 /&gt; 

A narrative that comes close to the notion of Ancient Macedonian nationhood during the coming into being of a modern Macedonian state, was the idea of a [[United Macedonia |United or Greater Macedonia]], which was based on the estimated territory of the Ancient Kingdom of Macedon under the rule of Philip II. Early national poets used those borders in order to define a corresponding nation in their writings. The [[Anti-fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia |ASNOM]] manifesto (English: Anti-fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia; Macedonian: Antifašističko Sobranie za Narodno Osloboduvanje na Makedonija) took reference to the “shameful partition” of Macedonia in the course of the Balkan Wars and it contained the appeal to the “Macedonians under Bulgaria and Greece” to take part in the anti-fascist fight and the struggle for Macedonian unification.&lt;ref name=Vangeli15 /&gt;

Under the rule of [[Josip Broz Tito]] in Yugoslavia, Macedonia was recognized for the first time as an individual ethnic and political entity.&lt;ref&gt;Mazower, Mark (2000): The Balkans. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson (Universal history).&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, some regard the reason for the recognition of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] by Tito and his government as a pragmatic decision, inasmuch as the Macedonian national consciousness seemed a rather strong force, whose suppression might have been a demanding task.&lt;ref&gt;Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of a Greater Macedonia was also regarded as a crucial resource for Tito's expansionist ideas. The ideal was a greater [[Balkan Federation]] through the inclusion of Bulgaria and Greece. These plans stopped when Greek and Yugoslav communists split due to the discord between Tito and [[Joseph Stalin]].&lt;ref name=Vangeli15 /&gt;

Important for the Macedonian nation building process was the standardization of the [[Macedonian language]], as well as the publication of a national history. For this reason the Institute for National History was founded in 1948 through a government decree. What followed was the formation and reformation of national creation myths in academic circles and institutions, spearheaded by the Institute for National History and influenced by the interplay of politics, national interests and historiography and the subsequent creation of “historical ‘Masterpieces’” in order to support the uniqueness of Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnbauer, Ulf (2005): Ancient Nationhood and the Struggle for Statehood: Historiographic Myths in the Republic of Macedonia. In Pål Kolstø (Ed.): Myths and boundaries in south-eastern Europe. London: Hurst &amp; Co., pp. 262–296.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Troebst&gt;Troebst, Stefan (2003): Historical Politics and Historical “Masterpieces” in Macedonia before and after 1991.

In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stefan Troebst, concerning this matter, Macedonia has been regarded as an exception among the Yugoslavian states, since “the ideology of Yugoslavianism proclaimed in 1952 was here once again subordinated to the one of Macedonism”. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In Yugoslav times, several narratives of origin existed and the myth of Ancient Macedonian origin was incorporated in the nation building process. Nevertheless, according to Vangeli (and contrasting Troebst's view), this narrative was subordinated to the narrative of Yugoslav (i.e. South Slav) origin, which played a central role in Tito's Yugoslavian nation-building process. However, references to antiquity, for instance by means of official history books, were institutionalized already in Yugoslavian times.&lt;ref name=Vangeli16 /&gt; As Vangeli analyzes, the notion of Macedonian ancient history “[still] was taken with a reserve, and was mostly instrumentalized in the disputes with Bulgarian historiography and also as a protection from the nationalist discourse among certain Macedonians that was based on the idea of ‘returning the Bulgarian consciousness’ of Macedonians”.&lt;ref name=Vangeli16 /&gt;

Although official institutions used the recollection of antiquity in moderate ways, Ancient Macedonian narratives were crucial for the nationalism of parts of the [[Macedonian Diaspora]]. Agnew states, that “the 1980s had seen the emergence in Yugoslav Macedonia and in the Macedonian Diaspora (particularly in [[Macedonian Australian|Australia]] and [[Macedonian Canadians|Canada]]) of a ‘‘Macedonism’’ or [[Macedonian nationalism]] that drew exactly opposite conclusions about the ‘‘ethnicity’’ of ancient Macedonia and Alexander the Great than did [[Greek nationalism]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Agnew, John (2007): No Borders, No Nations: Making Greece in Macedonia. In: ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'' 97 (2), p. 408. DOI: 10.1111/j.1467-8306.2007.00545.x.&lt;/ref&gt; There has been evidence, that organization established by members of the Macedonian Diaspora in Australia, Canada and the [[Macedonian American|United States]] used ancient Macedonian symbols for representation purposes already before 1980. Further it has been argued, that ethnic Macedonian refugees who fled from [[Greek Macedonia]] in the times of the [[Greek Civil War]], were crucial for this initial development of antiquization, as the narrative of ancient descent has been regarded as credible among Greeks and ethnic Macedonians or [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia|Slavs in Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Roudometof, Victor (1996): Nationalism and identity politics in the Balkans: Greece and the Macedonian question. In ''Journal of Modern Greek Studies'' 14 (2), pp. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-independence period=== 
When the Republic of Macedonia declared its independence in 1991 and hence re-opened the national question, it faced criticism and denial from various sides and in various ways, which might have served as a source of inspiration for nationalistic discourses and later antiquization.&lt;ref name=Muhic138&gt;Muhić, Maja; Takovski, Aleksandar (2014): Redefining National Identity in Macedonia. Analyzing Competing Origins Myths and Interpretations through Hegemonic Representations. In ''Etnološka tribina'' 44 (37), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; While most states accepted the young state, some countries denied the independency of a Macedonian nation, the existence of a Macedonian language and the singularity of a Macedonian identity. Even nowadays, for instance, many Bulgarians, although officially recognizing the Republic of Macedonia, still regard Macedonians as ‘actually’ being Bulgarians.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,33&gt;Brunnbauer, Ulf (2015): Zwischen Eigensinn und Realitätsflucht: "Skopje 2014" als Bau an der Nation. In ''OST-WEST Europäische Perspektiven'' 16 (1), pp. 33ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Another controversial subject is the [[autocephaly]] of the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]]. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], most churches are organized on a national level. The independence of an Orthodox church is thus directly linked to a nation's recognition. However, to this day, the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian]], [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarian]] and [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek]] churches do not acknowledge the Macedonian Orthodox church, which can be interpreted as calling the existence of a Macedonian nation into question.&lt;ref name=Kubiena82&gt;Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), pp. 82ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The most known conflicts with neighboring countries, which influence Macedonia's politics till the present, are the flag and [[Macedonia naming dispute |name dispute]] with Greece. From a Macedonian perspective, the negation of a distinctive Macedonian language, history and customs seemed and seems like a fundamental challenge for their national identity. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Name and flag dispute with Greece===
Already shortly after the independence in 1992, official institutions gradually highlighted the ancient past more and more. The post-independence version of the official “History of the Macedonian People” dealt with the topic of the Ancient Macedonian Kingdom on 200 pages. In comparison, the edition from the year 1969 needed only 20 pages to treat the same topic.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnbauer, Ulf (2005): Ancient Nationhood and the Struggle for Statehood: Historiographic Myths in the Republic of Macedonia. In Pål Kolstø (Ed.): Myths and boundaries in south-eastern Europe. London: Hurst &amp; Co., p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the [[flag of the Republic of Macedonia]], the first public display of what later has been called antiquization, caused serious tensions with its neighboring country Greece. The new flag of the Republic of Macedonia depicted the [[Vergina Sun|Star of Vergina]]. This symbol, discovered in the 1970s, is regarded as the symbol of the [[Argead dynasty]], the ancient royal family of the kingdom of Macedon. It is claimed by Greece to be an integral part of its cultural and historical heritage.&lt;ref name=Vangeli17&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; This flag dispute went along with the infamous [[Macedonia naming dispute |name dispute]], since Greece also would not accept the name “Republic of Macedonia” for its neighboring country, as it feared usurpation of history as well as territorial claims from the Slavic-Macedonian side. Further, Greece rejects the term “Macedonian” for the description of the south Slavic language spoken in the Republic of Macedonia, as well as for the local population.&lt;ref name=Gromes163 /&gt; Due to political pressure by the Greek government, which eventually led to the signing of an [[Macedonia naming dispute#Interim Accord|Interim Accord]] in 1995, Macedonia temporally adopted the name “The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia” for international use, removed the Star of Vergina from its flag and erased all allegedly [[Irredentism|irredentist]] clauses from its constitution. Macedonia also had to refrain from using symbols that constitute a part of Greece’ historic or cultural patrimony.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations: United Nations Treaty No. 32193 Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia - Interim Accord. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of this agreement most narratives of Ancient Macedonian descent were suspended by official institutions. Yet, the myths of Ancient Macedonian origin never totally disappeared in all political and academic circles. Similarly, the ancient past remained a substantial part of Macedonian national history in history textbooks.&lt;ref name=Vangeli17 /&gt; 

The name dispute with Greece, which is still not solved, is not only a matter of political conflict, but through the construction of history and claims for heritage, this matter is advanced by scientific advocates for national causes on both sides.&lt;ref name=Kubiena86&gt;Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Étienne Balibar]] describes the importance of a nation's name for the national identity.&lt;ref name=Balibar&gt;Balibar, Etienne (1991): The Nation Form. History and Idiology. In Etienne Balibar, Immanuel Maurice Wallerstein (Eds.): Race, nation, class: ambiguous identities: Verso, pp. 86–106.&lt;/ref&gt; The consequent contestation of the name chosen by Macedonia obviously is a cause of frustration for the Macedonian government and parts of the population. If no solution will be found, the name dispute threatens to further block Macedonia's membership in the [[NATO]] as well as its accession to the [[European Union]]. [[Nikola Gruevski]], Macedonia's current prime minister and leader of the VMRO-DPMNE, stated that “his government and the population are not willing to tolerate ‘blackmailing’ by their Greek neighbors and perceive their request for a name-change as a threat to Macedonian identity”.&lt;ref name=Kubiena86 /&gt; Negating Macedonia's name and identity is thus perceived as negating the existence of Macedonians in general. In this manner, the name dispute plays a crucial role in the strengthening of national discourses, artistic production and serious tensions between the two major ethnic groups in Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;Muhić, Maja; Takovski, Aleksandar (2014): Redefining National Identity in Macedonia. Analyzing Competing Origins Myths and Interpretations through Hegemonic Representations. In ''Etnološka tribina'' 44 (37), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; For some ethnic Macedonians the name of the country has an existential meaning, since it is inseparably linked to their nation. For other population groups in Macedonia the country's name does not have this importance. They are rather unsatisfied that the government is not willing to concede in this matter, which would improve the foreign policy situation of the country and, hence, the country's economical opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Boskovska, Nada (2015): Makedonien - ein historischer Überblick. In ''OST-WEST Europäische Perspektiven'' 16 (1), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===NATO and European Union accession===
In April 2008, Greece blocked the [[Accession of Macedonia to NATO]] with a veto at the [[2008 Bucharest summit |Bucharest summit]]. Subsequently, in 2009, the Greek government prevented Macedonia from getting a date on part of the European Union for starting accession talks. The [[Accession of Macedonia to the European Union]] is still pending.&lt;ref name=Graewert25&gt;Graewert, Tim (2015): Die Regierungen Makedoniens 1990-2014 zwischen regionaler Vorbildfunktion und autoritärer Versuchung. In ''OST-WEST Europäische Perspektiven'' 16 (1), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gromes163 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vangeli18 /&gt; It has been argued, that since then, antiquization has “snowballed into a wider phenomenon”. As Macedonia's president [[Gjorge Ivanov]] announced, “the Classical drive” has its roots in “the frustration and depression felt after the NATO Summit in Bucharest”.&lt;ref name=Georgievski /&gt;

According to Graewert, the political elite of Macedonia enabled a peaceful secession from [[Yugoslav Wars|war-torn Yugoslavia]] in 1991. Ten years later they managed the relatively mild, compared to the [[Kosovo War]],  settlement of the armed conflict with the [[National Liberation Army (Albanians of Macedonia)|UÇK]]. In a regional comparison these achievements have been regarded as a best-practice model. Thus, in 2005 Macedonia was rewarded with the status of an EU candidate country. But since Greece stopped Macedonia's NATO accession in violation of the law of nations, on the one hand, the Macedonian government has surrendered to the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] temptation and increasingly shown semi-[[Autocracy|autocratic]] tendencies,&lt;ref name=Graewert25 /&gt; and on the other hand, the self-consciousness of the majority of ethnic Macedonians has been additionally perpetuated.&lt;ref name=Vangeli22&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The potentially upcoming EU membership had been perceived as an important step for Macedonia's economic progress. And the NATO affiliation had been regarded as a promise that violent incidents such as the [[2001 insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia|2001 conflict]] would not be repeated.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The fact of being excluded from these organizations despite the investments and reforms that had been undertaken, ultimately revitalized the uncertainty concerning the country's economic and security perspectives. This has strengthened the “defeatist attitude”, that, irrespective of the efforts of the Macedonian government, Greece and other opponents would always find a possibility to block Macedonia's progress.&lt;ref name=Vangeli22 /&gt; “The main engine driving nation-state building has not been Albanian-Macedonian relations, but rather the tensions with Greece over Macedonia’s name, particularly acute since the Greek veto to Macedonia’s NATO membership in 2008. The widely pursued antiquization campaign, including the megalomanic project Skopje 2014, have emphasized promoting one ethnic defined identity”.&lt;ref&gt;Bieber, Florian (2011): Introduction: Assessing the Ohrid Framework Agreement. In Marija Risteska, Zhidas Daskalovski (Eds.): Assessing the Ohrid Framework Agreement, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, it has been argued, that Greece showed vigorous reactions to the initial antiquization policies, such as the renaming of Skopje's airport in 2007, which subsequently altered Greece's attitude towards the Republic of Macedonia. In the end, the name issue and next to it the symbolic dispute about the ancient Macedonian heritage became the last obstacle on Macedonia's unsuccessful way to negotiations for full EU membership.&lt;ref name=Vangeli25&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===VMRO–DPMNE's arrival to power===
In the [[Macedonian parliamentary election, 2006]], VMRO-DPMNE became the largest power in the [[Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia]]. Since the [[Macedonian parliamentary election, 2008]], the ruling party, led by Prime Minister [[Nikola Gruevski]], formed a coalition with the largest Albanian party, [[Democratic Union for Integration |DUI]] (Democratic Union for Integration).&lt;ref&gt;Gromes, Thorsten (2012): Ohne Staat und Nation ist keine Demokratie zu machen. Bosnien und Herzegowina, Kosovo und Makedonien nach den Bürgerkriegen. 1. Aufl. Baden-Baden: Nomos (Studien der Hessischen Stiftung Friedens- und Konfliktforschung, 17). p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; It is this period after the arrival to power of the VMRO-DPMNE that is inseparably linked to antiquization, since it is the time when the myths of ancient nationhood gained new importance due to VMRO-DPMNE's devotion to nationalist and identitarian politics. It is the time when antiquization gained its full potential for political mobilization, when the “name of Alexander the Great was used to simply depict the nation’s grandeur and to nourish the people’s spirit” &lt;ref name=Vangeli17 /&gt; and when the VMRO-DPMNE “aimed to gain the loyalty of Macedonian nationalists once again” &lt;ref name=Vangeli18 /&gt; through the celebration of national mythology. It is this period, which experienced all the example of antiquization described above.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Perceptions of 'antiquization'==
===Government (VMRO-DPMNE) position===
The perceptions of the identitarian and historical politics of VMRO-DPMNE in Macedonia and across the globe differ strongly. VMRO-DPMNE presents its policies and their visual manifestation as the representation of the true Macedonian history. According to this viewpoint it is not inventing but representing history as it was and rewriting a hidden history.&lt;ref&gt;Muhić, Maja; Takovski, Aleksandar (2014): Redefining National Identity in Macedonia. Analyzing Competing Origins Myths and Interpretations through Hegemonic Representations. In ''Etnološka tribina'' 44 (37), pp. 150ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The antiquization politics and Skopje 2014 are often represented as being conducted and facilitated by the government. This is applicable to the VMRO-DPMNE, the leading party of the government, which seeks to represent issues of the ethnic Macedonian majority of the country, but as Ulf Brunnbauer points out, the coalition partner DUI, rejects these policies.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,29&gt;Brunnbauer, Ulf (2015): Zwischen Eigensinn und Realitätsflucht: "Skopje 2014" als Bau an der Nation. In ''OST-WEST Europäische Perspektiven'' 16 (1), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Proponents of the government's politics of the recollection of ancient Macedonian origin and its display in Skopje 2014 argue that “it neatly offers a linear chronological overview of all things Macedonian”.&lt;ref name=Muhic141 /&gt; In this view, Skopje 2014 is seen as an opportunity for history to neutrally speak for itself, as if the understanding and presentation of history would not be ideologically and politically disputed but rather obvious and objective. Accordingly, this (re)presentation of history is thus not influenced by VMRO-DPMNE's ideological beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Muhić, Maja; Takovski, Aleksandar (2014): Redefining National Identity in Macedonia. Analyzing Competing Origins Myths and Interpretations through Hegemonic Representations. In ''Etnološka tribina'' 44 (37), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term “antiquization”, which reveals a willing recollection and re-interpretation of an alleged ancient past, is thus dismissed by government proponents as an “invented [[neologism]] in a broad anti-Macedonian [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]]”&lt;ref name=Vangeli13 /&gt; that tries to undermine Macedonia's true historical grandeur.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Critical perspectives on 'antiquization'===
The recollection of antiquity of the VMRO-DPMNE, so-called antiquization, experiences strong criticism from various directions and for various reasons. Macedonian and international civil society, scholars, oppositional politicians and neighboring countries, in particular Greece and Bulgaria, express their dislike. A lot of criticism refers to political, legal, esthetical and financial aspects concerning Skopje 2014. This article focuses mainly on criticism about the historical and political content and implications of the whole narrative referred to by “antiquization”, from which Skopje 2014 constitutes only one, but a very noticeable aspect. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

====Ethno-nationalistic discourse====
Among critics, antiquization is seen as an ethno-nationalistic discourse that is built around the outstanding figure of Alexander the Great. This power-ridden hegemonic discourse is mainly imposed by the political elite and the VMRO-DPMNE&lt;ref&gt;Muhić, Maja; Takovski, Aleksandar (2014): Redefining National Identity in Macedonia. Analyzing Competing Origins Myths and Interpretations through Hegemonic Representations. In ''Etnološka tribina'' 44 (37), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vangeli25 /&gt; and is based upon a process of rereading history. Such a process of the highly selective nationalist reading of history, the selective remembering and un-remembering of specific matters is regarded as essential for nationalist political mobilization.&lt;ref&gt;Coackley, John (2004): MOBILIZING THE PAST: NATIONALIST IMAGES OF HISTORY. In ''Nationalism and Ethnic Politics'' 10 (4), pp. 531–560.&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned above, some sections of the scientific and pseudo-scientific public increasingly fostered this process.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

====Myths of continuity and autochthony====
Linked to this nationalistic discourse is the construction of a national Macedonian identity. According to Brunnbauer, the Macedonian state just starts to get engaged with a project which its neighboring countries performed already in the course of the 19th century: to design a historical myth, which is based upon the ideas of historical continuity and [[Indigenism|autochthonous]] origin.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,31 /&gt; The aim is to “proof” or to convince Macedonians to believe in the continuity of ‘the’ Macedonian history and the direct descent of the modern ethnic Macedonians from the Ancient Macedonians. The endeavor is nothing less than drawing an uninterrupted line from the ancient Kingdom of Macedon to the present, in order to emphasize the great achievements of the Macedonian nation, its heritage and its peculiarity.&lt;ref&gt;Stojanov, Darko (2014): In search of autochthony: A case study of the Great Migration Period as presented in history textbooks in Macedonia. In ''Povijest u nastavi'' 10 (19 (1)), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a nationalist Macedonian perspective, the self-portrayal as descendants of the Ancient Macedonians has the advantage of presenting the Macedonians as an autochthonous people. In this way, a claim on Macedonian territory can be substantiated.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,31 /&gt; In the words of [[Margaret MacMillan]] "History provides much of the fuel for nationalism. It creates the collective memories that help to bring the nation into being. The shared celebration of the nation’s great achievements – and the shared sorrow at its defeat – sustain and foster it. The further back the history appears to go, the more solid and enduring the nation seems – and the worthier its claims".&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan, Margaret (2010): Dangerous games. The uses and abuses of history. Modern Library paperback ed. New York: Modern Library (A Modern Library chronicles book, 31), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; These claims not only contain territory. The principle of autochthonism also comprises the historical right of a nation to control certain symbols – “the older the nation is imagined, the more powerful it is, thus the more right it has to manifest its dominion”.&lt;ref name=Vangeli23&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), pp. 23ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Macedonian case the government attempts to legitimize its right to the name and the remaining symbolical capital of Macedonia by means of the supposed straight link with the Ancient Kingdom. The myth of autochthony also supplies the need to distinguish ethnic Macedonians from their neighbors and ethnically differing compatriots, as it suggests that the ancestors of the Macedonians lived in this area before it was populated by the ancestors of the neighboring peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Balibar refers to the myth of origins and national continuity as "an effective ideological form, in which the imaginary singularity of national formation is constructed daily, by moving back from present into history".&lt;ref name=Balibar /&gt; However, unpleasing for the Macedonians is the fact that substantial components of their myth already constitute fundamental elements of the interpretation of national history from their neighboring countries. As a consequence they experience aggressive repudiation for their claims&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,31 /&gt;

Another point of critique against the antiquization narrative and Skopje 2014 aims at the alleged neatly “linear chronological overview of all things Macedonian”. Maja Muhić and Aleksandar Takovski regard this claim as ironic, since they almost cannot find any correlation between the represented figures that are used to demonstrate the continuity of Macedonian national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Muhić, Maja; Takovski, Aleksandar (2014): Redefining National Identity in Macedonia. Analyzing Competing Origins Myths and Interpretations through Hegemonic Representations. In ''Etnološka tribina'' 44 (37), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

A challenge for the continuity narrative and a reason for the conflicting national historical claims of the different states in the Balkans is the dynamic and changeful past of this region. A part of what is nowadays called the geographical region Macedonia, belonged to the Ancient Kingdom of Macedon. Thereafter, at various times, the term ‘Macedonia’ covered different administrative districts of the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Byzantine Empire]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. None of these districts was permanent or stable. Already in Byzantine times, Byzantine writers used the terms “Macedonia” and “Macedonians” in different, sometimes unclear and misleading ways. “The generally accepted knowledge in today’s historiography holds that for [[Late Antiquity]], as well as for later in Byzantium, the term Macedonia/ Macedonians has a regional/provincial/geographical meaning, and certainly not an ethnic one”.&lt;ref&gt;Stojanov, Darko (2014): In search of autochthony: A case study of the Great Migration Period as presented in history textbooks in Macedonia. In ''Povijest u nastavi'' 10 (19 (1)), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

If one neglects the debate about the exact numbers, there is a rather broad consensus that during the Ottoman Empire the geographic region Macedonia was populated by [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Albanians]], [[Jews]], [[Vlachs]], [[Greeks]], [[Romani people|Roma]] and other smaller groups. However, throughout the Middle Ages and up until the early 20th century the Slavic speaking majority in the Region of Macedonia were more commonly referred to (both, by themselves and outsiders) as Bulgarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ppbuavUZKEwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Who+are+the+Macedonians&amp;hl=bg#v=snippet&amp;q=Crampton&amp;f=false|title=Who are the Macedonians?|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/im3/im_6_1.htm|title=Средновековни градови и тврдини во Македонија, Иван Микулчиќ, Македонска академија на науките и уметностите – Скопје, 1996, стр. 72.|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/da/da_summary.htm|title=Formation of the Bulgarian nation (summary) |author=Academician Dimitŭr Simeonov Angelov |publisher=Sofia-Press |year=1978 |pages=413–415 |accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in pre-nationalist times, terms such as "Bulgarian" did not possess a strict ethno-nationalistic meaning in modern aspect.&lt;ref&gt;When Ethnicity Did Not Matter in the Balkans. J V A Fine. pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, in the last phase of the Ottoman Empire, fierce fighting arose about the national affiliation of these people.&lt;ref&gt;Boskovska, Nada (2015): Makedonien - ein historischer Überblick. In ''OST-WEST Europäische Perspektiven'' 16 (1), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, at the time of the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire, Greeks, Bulgarians, and Serbs tried to include Macedonia into their states.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Eben (2009): The Ethnopolitics of Territorial Division in the Republic of Macedonia. In Ethnopolitics 8 (2), p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, all occurrences, events and ruptures that took place in the geographical region of Macedonia are neither a sequence of linear developments nor the inherent property of a single nation state. Nonetheless, in the attempt to consolidate their national identity, the newly emerging states in the Balkans tried to confirm singularity by claiming historical events and figures as being exclusively their own.&lt;ref&gt;Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Even if the notion of Ancient Macedonian descent might seem explicable if one considers the name dispute with Greece and the challenges to a Macedonian identity, and also if one takes into consideration the need to gain points in the ethnic-Macedonian part of the electorate: the narrative of continuity and autochthony is not the only choice available.&lt;ref&gt;Stojanov, Darko (2014): In search of autochthony: A case study of the Great Migration Period as presented in history textbooks in Macedonia. In ''Povijest u nastavi'' 10 (19 (1)), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reasons and motivation for 'antiquization'====
Several scholars see VMRO-DPMNE's promotion of so-called antiquization as a reaction to the stagnation of Macedonia's foreign affairs due to Greek opposition to Macedonia's efforts for EU and NATO-membership. According to this view, Gruevski's government thus prioritized its consolidation of power on the national level as well as it aims at fostering Macedonia's nation building process.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,30&gt;Brunnbauer, Ulf (2015): Zwischen Eigensinn und Realitätsflucht: "Skopje 2014" als Bau an der Nation. In ''OST-WEST Europäische Perspektiven'' 16 (1), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graewert, Tim (2015): Die Regierungen Makedoniens 1990-2014 zwischen regionaler Vorbildfunktion und autoritärer Versuchung. In ''OST-WEST Europäische Perspektiven'' 16 (1), p, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Flood describes these kinds of processes in a more general manner. Therefore, political myths and grand narratives, as for example ancient Macedonian nationhood, come up as a consequence of a situation in which a society experienced some kind of trauma.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Christopher (2002): Political myth. A theoretical introduction. New York: Routledge (Theorists of myth), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Others point out that the glory of a national hero like Alexander the Great helps to overcome what has been called the ‘moral crisis of [[post-communism]]’: the situation of a country that still has to handle the burden of a complex and tiresome post-communist transition, smoldering ethnicized tensions, a weak economy and low living standards.&lt;ref name=Vangeli22 /&gt; Vangeli, therefore, summarizes that “antiquity-inspired Macedonian nationalist rhetoric has emerged as a ‘compensation for backwardness’ (Hanák)&lt;ref group=note&gt;See: Hanák Péter: „A National Compensation for Backwardness“, Studies in East European  Thought, 46. 1 – 2 (1994): 33-45.&lt;/ref&gt; brought by the unsuccessful regime change and the incomplete consolidation of the new regime". However, as outlined above, Greece's opposition is also motivated by Macedonia's recollection of its alleged ancient history and descent. Both countries thus enter a vicious circle if one follows the argumentation that Greece's opposition was due to Macedonia's antiquization and Macedonia's antiquization was due to Greece's opposition. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Still, antiquization seems to effectively address the negative sentiments of some Macedonians and their feeling of being rejected. The notion of being descendants of a glorious and famous empire comforts some Macedonians and is used to strengthen national pride. The government's rhetoric of the glorious Macedonian past offers distinction from their neighbors, a legitimation for the national struggle and thus serves as an inspiration for political movements. At the same time the image of the celebrated past is contrasted to the image of a problematic and questionable present and in the end it is used for the mobilization of the masses.&lt;ref name=Vangeli22 /&gt;

Macedonian antiquization can be described as an act of communication that aims at two directions; inward as well as outward.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnbauer, Ulf (2015): Zwischen Eigensinn und Realitätsflucht: "Skopje 2014" als Bau an der Nation. In ''OST-WEST Europäische Perspektiven'' 16 (1), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; One aims at the inner nation building process, the other at the representation of Macedonia in the international sphere. By using names like Alexander the Great for its airports and highways, Macedonia tries to mobilize the potential of antiquity and to gain the impact of globally known and recognized names.&lt;ref name=Vangeli23 /&gt; Further, the image of antiquity is used for tourism advertisements on international television. Government-funded campaigns promote Macedonia as the ‘Cradle of Culture’ or bear the title ‘[[Macedonia timeless]]’ while presenting Macedonian archaeology and ancient heritage. In the same way, the monuments and buildings that constitute a part of Skopje 2014 are believed to help to improve Macedonia's image for international visitors and to attract tourists on a long-term basis.&lt;ref name=Vangeli23 /&gt;

====Skopje 2014: monocultural history vs. multicultural reality====
The urban planning project Skopje 2014 plays an outstanding and exceptionally visible role in Macedonia's identitarian politics and virtually can be seen as an illustration of the whole process of antiquization. Hence, this ‘mass-production of tradition’ and its ‘statuomania’&lt;ref&gt;Hobsbawm, E. J.; Ranger, T. O. (1983): The Invention of tradition. Cambridge [Cambridgeshire], New York: Cambridge University Press (Past and present publications).&lt;/ref&gt; also is a central object of critique. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Critics regard Skopje 2014 as a nationalistic construction site, where nation building gets a new meaning. Here the government literally builds a national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnbauer, Ulf (2015): Zwischen Eigensinn und Realitätsflucht: "Skopje 2014" als Bau an der Nation. In ''OST-WEST Europäische Perspektiven'' 16 (1), pp. 26–35.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the critique in terms of the content, the opposition's discourse harshly criticizes Skopje 2014 on several other grounds, including financial embezzlement and corruption; circumvention of local government laws, urban planning, and building permits; the non-transparent manner of planning and decision making; an unprofessional and devastating architectural concept; aesthetic [[kitsch]]; ‘cultural rape’ that demonstrates a lack of understanding of national and cultural values; and an expression of political [[totalitarianism]].&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,28&gt;Brunnbauer, Ulf (2015): Zwischen Eigensinn und Realitätsflucht: "Skopje 2014" als Bau an der Nation. In ''OST-WEST Europäische Perspektiven'' 16 (1), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muhić, Maja; Takovski, Aleksandar (2014): Redefining National Identity in Macedonia. Analyzing Competing Origins Myths and Interpretations through Hegemonic Representations. In ''Etnološka tribina'' 44 (37), pp. 147ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Nebosja Vilic, a professor at the Faculty of Arts in Skopje, sees the main problem of the project in the missing democratic public discussion. The sponsors of Skopje 2014, in contrast, try to avoid public debate and ideas of international as well as local experts and neglect them.&lt;ref name=Kubiena93&gt;Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major critique is obviously the high costs of the project. While government sources talk about total costs of about 80 million [[Euro]]s, critics estimate a total sum of approximately 500 million Euros.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,28 /&gt; And this in times in which 30 to 40 % of Macedonia's population are unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;De Munck, Victor C; Risteski, Ljupčo (2013): Macedonia. The political, social, economic and cultural foundations of a Balkan state. London, New York: I.B. Tauris (International library of historical studies, v. 87), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Many voices complain about such high and unfeasible costs and that the funds could have been invested differently, especially in times of a poor economic situation in Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), pp. 92ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The VMRO-DPMNE-led government has been accused of constantly prioritizing cultural policies over objective problems: in the course of a [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|global financial crisis]], the Macedonian government spends vast amounts of its state budget on the erection of statues, the construction of monumental buildings and archaeological excavations encouraged by the myths of ancient Macedonian descent instead of focusing on real problems. In this manner identity questions could also serve as a distraction.&lt;ref name=Vangeli23 /&gt; The government, on the contrary, brings forward the argument of economic benefit. It promotes Skopje 2014 as an investment encouraging the growth of the local economy, creating new jobs and acquiring extra income from newly attracted tourists.&lt;ref&gt;Muhić and Takovski, 2014: 147: “The ‘economic benefit’ argument was brought to the fore at a press conference held at the end of April 2013 (22. 4. 2013) where the Macedonian Minister of Culture, Mrs. Elizabeta Kanceska Milevska, in an exhaustive manner attempted to justify the financial expenditure by both presenting the project cost and reminding the public of the economic benefit of the project which she described as a capital investment with a visible and verifiable impact upon structural engineering, encouraging the growth of industry, creating new jobs, and contributing to the accumulation of additional income from the number of tourist visits”.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Some scholars consider Skopje 2014 in its role as the most visible aspect of antiquization as a spectacular turning point in regard to official narratives of Macedonian national identity, turning away from previous narratives of national identity.&lt;ref name=Muhic138 /&gt; As described in the narrative referred to as antiquization, according to them, Skopje 2014 intends to construct an explicit narrative of Macedonian identity by manufacturing a continuity from antiquity over the Middle Ages to the time of Macedonia's struggle for nationhood, and incorporating this into Skopje's built environment.&lt;ref&gt;Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors in the city centre of Skopje can observe the emergence of the sculptured picture of a nation who praises its uninterrupted history of 2500 years and its heroes,&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,33 /&gt; not considering whether they are being 'borrowed' from other nations, derive from shared histories or earlier, rival forms of state formation&lt;ref name=Kubiena90&gt;Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; A nation who achieved fame in the past, who spread European civilization, a nation who defended its originality and independence against seemingly superior adversaries, who obtained its nationhood, a nation who is therefore meant for greater things.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,33 /&gt; Skopje 2014 "[t]hus […] fabricates an idealized, aesteticized version of Macedonian history, by selectively transforming the world of experience into a representation of an ideological tendency and by erasing others”.&lt;ref name=Kubiena90 /&gt;

Noticeable is the gender specific iconography of the monuments of Skopje 2014. Besides [[Mother Teresa]] there is only one other woman represented in a central position. A nameless pregnant woman who gives birth to a child, breast-feeds it, and subsequently nurtures it. This fountain constellation is called “Mothers of Macedonia”. The represented men, however, bear names and fight for the nation. In Brunnbauer's view, this perfectly illustrates the understanding of [[gender role]]s in traditional 19th century [[nationalism]].&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,34&gt;Brunnbauer, Ulf (2015): Zwischen Eigensinn und Realitätsflucht: "Skopje 2014" als Bau an der Nation. In ''OST-WEST Europäische Perspektiven'' 16 (1), pp. 34ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neglecting Ottoman and Yugoslav times====
At first sight it seems ironic that social scientists assert that the identitarian policies of VMRO-DPMNE and its manifestation in Skopje 2014 present disrupted narratives, since the way the past is remembered simply ignores and in its consequence deletes important parts of the history of the region. Critics point out that the remembrance of the Ottoman times is neglected, although over five hundred years of Ottoman rule and culture left its traces in the whole region. They even speak about a “de-Ottomanization” process obliterating Ottoman heritage and moving away from [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Mattioli, Fabio (2013): Unchanging boundaries: the reconstruction of Skopje and the politics of heritage. In ''International Journal of Heritage Studies'' 20 (6), p. 601.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Muhic142 /&gt; Also the Yugoslavian times, which had significant impact on the young Macedonian state as well, are cut out of the alleged historical continuity. For VMRO-DPMNE both periods constitute an [[anathema]]: the Ottoman rule - the so-called Turkish yoke – is regarded as the dark 500 years. The affiliation to the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] is seen as the time of suppressing Macedonia's striving for autonomy.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,29 /&gt; The intended cutting off of the socialist legacy&lt;ref name=Koteska /&gt; again seems ironic, since it was under the guidance and as part of the SFRY that the Republic of Macedonia was constituted for the first time in the year 1944.&lt;ref name=Muhic142 /&gt;

In Muhić and Takovskis’ view, Skopje 2014 “aims at creating a Macedonian, Orthodox Christian national identity amidst competing neighbouring agendas and the multicultural setting of the country. It does so by tearing apart, fragmenting and creating discontinuous segments of the organic tissue of the history of this region and country for the benefit of a few and the loss of the vast majority of Macedonian citizens”.&lt;ref&gt;Muhić, Maja; Takovski, Aleksandar (2014): Redefining National Identity in Macedonia. Analyzing Competing Origins Myths and Interpretations through Hegemonic Representations. In ''Etnološka tribina'' 44 (37), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Also other authors describe Skopje 2014 as a project aimed at redefining Skopje's urban character within a short time. New buildings disguise and hide the [[Modern architecture|modernist constructions]] of the Yugoslav period as well as the [[Ottoman architecture]] of the [[Old Bazaar, Skopje |Carcija]] (the old Turkish Bazaar), which have been the two most distinctive characteristics of the city.&lt;ref name=Graan161&gt;Graan, Andrew (2013): COUNTERFEITING THE NATION? Skopje 2014 and the Politics of Nation Branding in Macedonia. In ''Cultural Anthropology'' 28 (1), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koteska /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kubiena, Michael (2012): Skopje 2014-Musealizing the City, Re-inventing History? In ''The Western Balkans Policy Review'' 2 (1), pp. 87ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mattioli, Fabio (2013): Unchanging boundaries: the reconstruction of Skopje and the politics of heritage. In International Journal of Heritage Studies 20 (6), p. 600.&lt;/ref&gt; “Instead, the project promises Skopje a new image, one that will deliver Macedonia a properly “European” capital, at once attractive to outsiders and worthy of national pride”.&lt;ref name=Graan161 /&gt;

====Inter-ethnic tensions====
Further, critics claim, that the identitarian politics, by writing a mono-ethnic and mono-cultural history, not only leave out certain parts of the country's history, but that the multicultural reality of the Macedonian Republic is being ignored. Disregarding the Ottoman and Muslim heritage, emphasizing the Christian cultural imprint, focusing only on matters regarding the origin of ethnic Macedonians and ignoring the multicultural Macedonian reality, pushes the [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia|Albanian population]] and other minority groups such as Turks, Vlachs, Serbs and Roma to the side and signals that they are not an integral part of Macedonian history and, hence, Macedonia.&lt;ref name=Koteska /&gt;&lt;ref name=Muhic142 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vangeli24&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics describe that the multicultural approach that was elaborated in the [[Ohrid Framework Agreement]] (OFA) in 2001 and improved the conditions of the Albanian population, is now rejected due to antiquization and Skopje 2014. It has also been stated that this mono-ethnic display and interpretation of history symbolically degrades ethnic Albanians to the status they had before the 2001 agreement. This is to say that antiquization and Skopje 2014 erode the basis of the post-OFA Macedonian society, i.e. the inclusive model of representation and the recognition of [[cultural diversity]]. Leading to a re-ethnicization of multiple levels of society.&lt;ref name=Muhic142 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Spaskovska&gt;Spaskovska, Ljubica (2012): The fractured ‘we’ and the ethno-national ‘I’: the Macedonian citizenship framework. In ''Citizenship Studies'' 16 (3-4), p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vangeli24 /&gt;
	
Even [[Sam Vaknin]], a former advisor to Prime Minister Gruevski, delineated antiquization as an [[Albanophobia|anti-Albanian]] nation-building project, rather than being [[Anti-Greek sentiment|anti-Greek]] or anti-Bulgarian.&lt;ref name=Georgievski /&gt; Also other authors regard Skopje 2014 as a message in the permanent tensions between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority. They coincide in their view upon Skopje 2014 having an ethnic-Macedonian connotation, ignoring the ethnic plurality of the city. In Brunnbauer's view, this also serves to demonstrate the Macedonian claim to ownership of “their” capital, which they see threatened by the Albanians.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,30 /&gt;
	
Skopje 2014 does not offer any space for symbols of reconciliation. For instance the 2001 conflict between mainly ethnic Macedonian armed forces and the Albanian guerilla is remembered and represented only from an ethnic-Macedonian perspective. The "strategic positioning of some of the religion-inspired statues rather appear as a provocation of the predominantly Muslim Albanian community".&lt;ref name=Kubiena90 /&gt; The construction of a new Orthodox church on the main city square, as it had been planned and presented in the Skopje 2014 promotion video, could so far be prevented due to engaged protest.&lt;ref name=Kubiena93 /&gt;
	
Antiquization and Skopje 2014 are widely perceived as causing deterioration in inter-ethnic relations. Minority groups in Macedonia oppose the one-sided ethnocentric approach of antiquization and leading Albanians have warned about the growing frustration among non-Macedonians. Furthermore, Skopje 2014 is largely regarded as blocking Macedonia's [[European integration]] process, which some observers consider as one main strategic goal of Albanian politics in Macedonia.&lt;ref name=Gromes164&gt;Gromes, Thorsten (2012): Ohne Staat und Nation ist keine Demokratie zu machen. Bosnien und Herzegowina, Kosovo und Makedonien nach den Bürgerkriegen. 1. Aufl. Baden-Baden: Nomos (Studien der Hessischen Stiftung Friedens- und Konfliktforschung, 17), p.164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Muhic142 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vangeli24&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, an enduring blockade of the integration could foster ethnic conflicts. And according to Gromes, without the perspective of the accession to the European Union, the incentive disappears to further work on ethnic balancing and the implementation of the OFA.&lt;ref name=Gromes164 /&gt; In this manner, the name dispute and the struggle about historical heritage with neighboring Greece could heavily burden Macedonian-Albanian relations. A Survey reveals that 17 percent of the ethnic Macedonians and 78 percent of the ethnic Albanians favor a change of the constitutional name “Republic of Macedonia”.&lt;ref&gt;Rosůlek, Přemysl (2011): Macedonina in 2011 - on the way towards stabilization or before the new 'grand' agreement? In Marija Risteska, Zhidas Daskalovski (Eds.): Assessing the Ohrid Framework Agreement, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Another survey indicates that 82 percent of the ethnic Macedonians prioritize the name “Republic of Macedonia” over NATO and European Union accessions.&lt;ref&gt;Gromes, Thorsten (2012): Ohne Staat und Nation ist keine Demokratie zu machen. Bosnien und Herzegowina, Kosovo und Makedonien nach den Bürgerkriegen. 1. Aufl. Baden-Baden: Nomos (Studien der Hessischen Stiftung Friedens- und Konfliktforschung, 17).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intra-Macedonian tensions====
It has been argued, that the antiquization process illustrates a situation of power imbalance and power abuse within Macedonian internal politics. It has been described that the government-led discourse attempted to silence opposing voices and by doing so risking the elimination of public space and the emergence of insuperable ideological, political and social gaps in an already unstable social and political realities.&lt;ref&gt;Muhić, Maja; Takovski, Aleksandar (2014): Redefining National Identity in Macedonia. Analyzing Competing Origins Myths and Interpretations through Hegemonic Representations. In ''Etnološka tribina'' 44 (37), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; These societal fissures do not only run along ethnic lines but even disunite ethnic Macedonians for various reasons, as for instance believing in Slavic or Ancient descent or supporting VMRO-DPMNE or [[SDSM]].&lt;ref name=Vangeli24 /&gt;

==Consequences of 'antiquization' from a critical perspective==
The processes in Macedonia that have been called antiquization, show, which significance the ones in power give to history as a resource for political legitimacy and mobilization.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,34 /&gt; Externally, the enterprise of revising Macedonia's official history and to work on the national self-image of ethnic Macedonians has negatively influenced the dynamics of the name dispute with Greece and, hence, deteriorated the international position of the country. Simultaneously, it has fostered inter-ethnic tensions and posed serious challenges for the weak multicultural society.&lt;ref&gt;Vangeli, Anastas (2011): Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. In ''Nationalities Papers'' 39 (1), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; However, with regard to home affairs, antiquization seems to have fulfilled its purpose. VMRO-DPMNE wins elections on a regular basis, which, according to Brunnbauer do not entirely meet European standards of fairness, but still represent a realistic picture of the political preferences in the country.&lt;ref name=Brunnbauer2015,31 /&gt; To the strong criticism of antiquization, the Macedonian government and its proponents replied by defending their indentitarian policies and by further fortifying antiquization.&lt;ref name=Vangeli25 /&gt;
	
Yet, critics warn about increasing ethnic and other social fissures and a growing fragmentation of the relatively unstable society.&lt;ref name=Spaskovska /&gt; Again others consider a continuing blockade of Macedonia's European integration as the country's main threat, as they regard the European integration as the only option for keeping the Macedonian state together and avoiding its disintegration.&lt;ref name=Gromes163 /&gt;

Surveys from the Institute of Social Sciences and Humanities Skopje (ISSHS) on the effects of Skopje 2014 on the perceptions of the population of Skopje revealed a high degree of uncertainty regarding their national identity. In a poll asking people to choose the historical period that defines the Macedonian national identity, the breakdown of responses was as follows: Independence (from 1991) 13%; enlightenment period (19th century) 26%; the revolutionary period (beginning of the 20th century) 31%; SFRY 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Social Sciences and Humanities -Skopje (2013): Skopje 2014 Project and its Effects on the Perception of Macedonian Identity Among the Citizens of Skopje.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the results of a supplementary national poll, carried out by ISSHS in September 2013, only 5.8% of the general population viewed antiquity as a historically and culturally defining period for Macedonia, whereas among ethnic Macedonians the result was 7.6%. “These results show that there is a great discrepancy between the population’s sentiment and the narrative the Government seeks to promote”.&lt;ref&gt;Muhić, Maja; Takovski, Aleksandar (2014): Redefining National Identity in Macedonia. Analyzing Competing Origins Myths and Interpretations through Hegemonic Representations. In ''Etnološka tribina'' 44 (37), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bhoja II''' was a 13th-century king of the [[Paramara dynasty]] in central India. He succeeded [[Arjunavarman II|Arjuna II]] as the king of [[Dhar]]a in [[Malwa]] region.

According to ''[[Hammira Mahakavya]]'', written by the Jain poet Nayachandra Suri, the [[Chahamanas of Ranastambhapura|Chahmana]] ruler [[Hammiradeva|Hammira]] defeated Arjuna of Sarasapura and Bhoja of Dhara. Based on this, [[R. C. Majumdar]] concluded that Hammira must have invaded Malwa twice: once during the reign of Arjuna II, and again, during the reign of Bhoja II.{{sfn|Majumdar|1966|pp=85-86}} Because Hammira ascended the Chauhan throne during 1282-83, Bhoja must have ascended the Paramara throne sometime after 1283 CE.{{sfn|Sastri|1970|p=828}}

Pratipal Bhatia, on the other hand, speculates that Arjuna II's minister Goga-deva rebelled against him, and put Bhoja II on the throne of Dhara as a titular king. The 16th-century historian [[Firishta]] describes Goga as the "Raja of Malwa". According to Bhatia's theory, Goga-deva became the ''de facto'' independent ruler of one part of the Paramara kingdom, while Arjuna II continued to control another part.{{sfn|Bhatia|1970|p=160}}

Bhoja II was succeeded by [[Mahlakadeva]].{{sfn|Majumdar|1966|pp=853}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16405">'''Comparative history''' is the comparison of different societies which existed during the same time period or shared similar cultural conditions.

The comparative history of societies emerged as an important specialty among intellectuals in the Enlightenment in the 18th century, as typified by [[Montesquieu]], [[Voltaire]], [[Adam Smith]], and others. Sociologists and economists in the 19th century often explored comparative history, as exemplified by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[Max Weber]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Kalberg, ''Max Weber's Comparative-Historical Sociology'' (University of Arizona Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 20th century, a large reading public followed the comparative histories of (German) [[Oswald Spengler]],&lt;ref&gt;Spengler (1918)&lt;/ref&gt; (Russian-American) [[Pitirim Sorokin]],&lt;ref&gt;Sorokin (1950); Sorokin (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; and (British) [[Arnold J. Toynbee]].&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee (1934-61)&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1950s, however, comparative history has faded from the public view, and is now the domain of specialized scholars working independently.&lt;ref&gt;Barraclough (1979), chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the people mentioned above, recent exemplars of comparative history include American historians [[Herbert E. Bolton]] and [[Carroll Quigley]], and British historian [[Geoffrey Barraclough]]. Several sociologists are also prominent in this field, including [[Barrington Moore]],  [[S. N. Eisenstadt]],&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstadt (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], [[Charles Tilly]],&lt;ref&gt;Tilly (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Mann (sociologist)|Michael Mann]].&lt;ref&gt;Mann (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians generally accept the comparison of particular institutions (banking, women's rights, ethnic identities) in different societies, but since the hostile reaction to Toynbee in the 1950s, generally do not pay much attention to sweeping comparative studies that  cover wide swaths of the world over many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, ''Arnold J. Toynbee: A Life'' (1989) ch 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable topics==

===Comparative studies of the Roman and Han empires===
Main article: [[Comparative studies of the Roman and Han empires]]

The ancient Chinese and Roman Empires are often compared due to their synchronous and analogous developments from warring states into universal empires.

===Atlantic history===

[[Atlantic history]] studies the [[Atlantic World]] in the [[early modern period]]. It is premised on the idea that, following the rise of sustained European contact with the New World in the 16th century, the continents that bordered the Atlantic Ocean&amp;mdash;the Americas, Europe, and Africa&amp;mdash;constituted a regional system or common sphere of economic and cultural exchange that can be studied as a totality.

Its theme is the complex interaction between Europe (especially Britain and France) and the [[European colonization of the Americas|New World colonies]]. It encompasses a wide range of demographic, social, economic, political, legal, military, intellectual and religious topics treated in comparative fashion by looking at both sides of the Atlantic. Religious revivals characterized Britain and Germany, as well as the [[First Great Awakening]] in the American colonies. Migration and race/slavery have been important topics.&lt;ref&gt;William O'Reilly, "Genealogies of Atlantic History," ''Atlantic Studies'' 1 (2004): 66–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a relatively new field, it has stimulated numerous studies of comparative history especially regarding ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Palmer, ''Age of Democratic Revolution'' (2 vol 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; colonialism,&lt;ref&gt;Stoler (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; slavery, economic history, and political revolutions in the 18th century in North and South America, Europe and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Wim Klooster, ''Revolutions in the Atlantic World: A Comparative History'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modernization models===
Beginning with German and French sociologists of the late 19th century, [[modernization]] models have been developed to show the sequence of transitions from traditional to modern societies, and indeed to postmodern societies. This research flourished especially in the 1960s, with Princeton University setting up seminars that compared the modernization process in China, Japan, Russia and other nations.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Edwin Black, ed. ''The Modernization of Japan and Russia: a comparative study'' (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Edwin Black, ''The dynamics of modernization: a study in comparative history'' (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Rozman, ''Urban networks in Ching China and Tokugawa Japan'' (1974)
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Rozman, ''The Modernization of China'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernization theory and history have been explicitly used as guides for countries eager to develop rapidly, such as China. Indeed, modernization has been proposed as the most useful framework for [[world history]] in China, because as one of the developing countries that started late, "China's modernization has to be based on the experiences and lessons of other countries."&lt;ref&gt;Qian Chengdan, "Constructing a New Disciplinary Framework of Modern World History Around the Theme of Modernization," ''Chinese Studies in History'' Spring 2009, Vol. 42#3 pp 7-24; in [[EBSCO]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative politics===
The field of comparative history often overlaps with the subdivision of [[political science]] known as [[comparative politics]].&lt;ref&gt;Doyle (1986)
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meritt and Rokkan (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; This includes "transnational" history &lt;ref&gt;McGerr (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes also international history.&lt;ref&gt;Iriye (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative history of minorities===
Mordechai Zaken compared two non-Muslim minorities in Kurdistan, the Jews and the Assyrian Christians in their relationships with their Muslim rulers and tribal chieftains during the 19th and 20th centuries. His comparative study gave a much clearer picture on the status of the minorities and their relationships with the ruling elites in and around Kurdistan. His PhD dissertation and the book upon which it was based have been widely spread and translated into the local languages in Kurdistan and the surrounding.&lt;ref&gt;Revised and Second Ebook edition and digital format, The Jews of Kurdistan and their Tribal Chieftains: A Study in Survival, Mordechai (Moti) Zaken (Jerusalem, 2015); Jewish Subjects and their Tribal Chieftains in Kurdistan: A Study in Survival (Leiden and Boston): Brill, 2007. {{ISBN|978-9004161900}} Yahud Kurdistan wa-ru'as'uhum al-qabaliyun: Dirasa fi fan al-baqa'.

===Military history===
[[Military history|Military historians]] have often compared the organization, tactical and strategic ideas, leadership, and national support of the militaries of different nations.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers: Economic Change and Military Conflict from 1500 to 2000'' (Random House, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victor Davis Hanson, ''The Father of Us All: War and History, Ancient and Modern'' (Bloomsbury Press, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have emphasized the need to stretch beyond battles and generals to do more comparative analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert M. Citino]], "Military Histories Old and New: A Reintroduction," ''American Historical Review'' )2007) 112#4 pp.&amp;nbsp;1070–1090  [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/resolve?AHRahr.112.4.1070PDF online version]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne E. Lee, ed., ''Warfare and Culture in History'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery===
The study of slavery in comparative perspective, ranging from the ancient world to the 19th century, has attracted numerous historians since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;David Brion Davis, ''The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture''  (1966); Seymour Drescher, ''Abolition: A History of Slavery and Antislavery'' (Cambridge University Press, 2009); Paul Finkelman, and Joseph Miller, eds. ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of World Slavery'' (Macmillan, 2 vol 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
Much of [[economic history]] in recent years has been done by model-building economists who show occasional interest in comparative data analysis.  Considerable work has been done by historians on the "Great Divergence"  debate launched by Kenneth Pomeranz in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Pomeranz, ''The great divergence: China, Europe, and the making of the modern world economy'' (Princeton University Press, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; At issue is why Europe moved forward rapidly after 1700 well Asia did not.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Ville, "Divergence and Convergence: New and Shifting Paradigms in Comparative Economic History." ''Australian Economic History Review'' (2015) 55#1 pp: 80-94.&lt;/ref&gt;  More traditional research methodologies have been combined with econometrics, for example in the comparison of merchant guilds in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Regina Grafe, and Oscar Gelderblom, "The Rise and Fall of the Merchant Guilds: Re-thinking the Comparative Study of Commercial Institutions in Premodern Europe," ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History,'' (2010) 40#4 pp: 477-511,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantitative methods==

Since the work of Sorokin,&lt;ref&gt;Pitirim A. Sorokin, ''Social and Cultural Dynamics'' (4 vol 1932; one-vol. edn., 1959).&lt;/ref&gt; scholars in comparative history, especially if sociologists and political scientists, have often used quantitative and statistical data to compare multiple societies on multiple dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Merritt, and Stein Rokkan, eds. ''Comparing Nations: The Use of Quantitative Data in Cross-National Research'' (Yale UP, 1966)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Bruce Russett, Harvey Starr, and David Kinsella, ''World Politics: The Menu for Choice'' (2010) p. 432&lt;/ref&gt; There have been some efforts made to build mathematical dynamic models, but these have not come into the mainstream comparative history.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Turchin, ''History and Mathematics: Historical Dynamics and Development of Complex Societies'' (Moscow: KomKniga, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31950">'''Conjectural history''' is a type of [[historiography]] isolated in the 1790s by [[Dugald Stewart]], who termed it "theoretical or conjectural history", as prevalent in the historians and early social scientists of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. As Stewart saw it, such history makes space for speculation about causes of events, by postulating natural causes that could have had such an effect. His concept was to be identified closely with the French terminology ''histoire raisonnée'', and the usage of "natural history" by [[David Hume]] in his work ''[[The Natural History of Religion]]''.

Such conjectural history was the antithesis of the [[narrative history]] being written at the time by [[Edward Gibbon]] and [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]]. Stewart defended it as more universal in its application to [[humankind]], even at the cost of detailed documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet and Costa, p. 629.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not concerned with the political narrative and public life, but saw itself as an investigative "moral science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Salber Phillips|title=Society and Sentiment: Genres of Historical Writing in Britain, 1740–1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zZjGBmpk88C&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=3 March 2013|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2362-8|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; General philosophical history was somewhat closer to narrative history than conjectural history could be, with its reliance in part on tenuous arguments on the nature of [[feudalism]] and early ethnographical reports from European travellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosemary Sweet|title=Writing of Urban Histories in 18th Century England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n32ZwLcgaFUC&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-820669-9|pages=143–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Stewart the ''Dissertation on the Origin of Languages'' by [[Adam Smith]] was an important example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=scottish-18th |title=Scottish Philosophy in the 18th Century |last=Broadie |first=Alexander|Thu Aug 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To justify the procedures of conjectural history, there needed to be an assumption of the uniformity of [[human nature]], or as Stewart put it, the "capacities of the human mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Alexander Broadie |title=The Scottish Enlightenment: An Anthology|year=1997 |publisher=Canongate Books |isbn=978-0-86241-738-3|pages=25–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conjectural history has been identified as "the core of a theory" of [[progress (history)|progress]] within Scottish philosophical history of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Salber Phillips|title=Society and Sentiment: Genres of Historical Writing in Britain, 1740–1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zZjGBmpk88C&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2362-8|pages=171–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pocock writes that Scottish conjectural history was "of considerable importance to Gibbon and the creation of philosophical historiography".&lt;ref&gt;Pocock, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1780s there were European historians of culture who worked in a different way, preferring an [[inductive method]] to the pure deductions of conjectural history.&lt;ref name="Carhart2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael C.

==Early Modern context==
There was nothing new in the idea of stages of society on its own, but social thinking itself was changing in [[Early Modern Europe]], particularly on [[civil society]] in its components, [[civility]] and "society".

===Models and the "savage"===
{{main article|Noble savage}}
Hodgen comments, in a chapter ''From Hierarchy to History'', on the widespread use of "conjectural series" for historical explanation in the Early Modern period. The [[great chain of being]] was a static idea. "Stage series" had roots in classical thought, but might be associated with cyclic models, or incorporate ideas of decline with those of progress. She writes that in time

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;it seems certain that hierarchical ideas, temporalized to suit the needs of the conjectural historian of culture, were mixed with historical assumptions concerning the savage as a conjectural first member of these conjectural series.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgen, p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Early Modern natural history===
While the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]] was a classical Roman encyclopedic work, "natural history" had several different meanings in the Early Modern period. The one relevant in this article is the [[Baconian natural history]], i.e. a systematic collection of observable information on natural phenomena. A natural history did not belong to [[natural philosophy]], which was theoretical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=G. N. Cantor|author3=J. R. R. Christie|author2=M. J. S. Hodge, R. C. Olby|title=Companion to the History of Modern Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gkJn6ciwYZsC&amp;pg=PT260|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=6 August 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-97751-2|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Histoire raisonnée''===
The ''histoire raisonnée'' was a genre of historical writing developed in France in the 17th century, with concerns for the individual in social context, and the description of culture and customs as integral to history. It grew out of [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] historiography with its close relationship to classical Roman and Greek models, but brought to the surface social matters, in particular as they could explain the motivations of individuals. With [[Géraud de Cordemoy]] there came an interest in causality as playing a part in historical movement, as distinct from the humanist acceptance of personal fates being subject to [[Fortuna|Fortune]].&lt;ref&gt;Leffler, pp. 223–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stadial history===
Contemporary terminology is '''stadial history''', or in other words the discussion of stages of society by theoretical means (see [[sociocultural evolution#Stadial theory]]). Stadial theory as an innovation is attributed to the jurist [[Samuel Pufendorf]].&lt;ref name="FitzpatrickJones2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Fitzpatrick|author2=Peter Jones|author3=Christa Knellwolf|author4=Iain McCalman|title=Enlightenment World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSFy4wZ6Bz0C&amp;pg=PT258|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=22 July 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-60784-6|pages=258–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grotius]] had already used conjectural history to discuss [[Aquinas]] on [[private property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Istvan Hont|title=Jealousy Of Trade: International Competition and the Nation State in Historical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lHu6kBLV4CUC&amp;pg=PA422|accessdate=4 March 2013|year=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01038-3|pages=422–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some basic conjectural history on [[human civilization]] was therefore discussed in the 17th century. Later [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] rejected the concept of the [[state of nature]], and with [[Count Buffon]] debated the rise of civilization. The Scottish contribution then took the theory to a new level, with its [[anthropocentrism]] and detailed explanations of human manipulation of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nathaniel Wolloch|title=History and Nature in the Enlightenment: Praise of the Mastery of Nature in Eighteenth-Century Historical Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWYe2DZbYskC&amp;pg=PA92|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 May 2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-2115-3|pages=92–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It laid emphasis on a typical society at its beginnings, regarding evidence from contemporary reports (particularly of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]) as valid.&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, pp. 24–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conjectural histories of language and writing==
Adam Smith in lectures on rhetoric, given from 1748,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Simpson Ross|title=The Life of Adam Smith|page=80|date=23 September 2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-161394-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; advanced a speculative history of language; he wrote that he had been prompted by a 1747 work of [[Gabriel Girard (priest)|Gabriel Girard]]. He was then interested in our awareness of literary style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Adam Smith: The Rhetoric of Propriety|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d_MODA0NVjQC&amp;pg=PA83|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8262-9|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the example that Dugald Stewart took up in coining the phrase "conjectural history". Elements would have been recognised at the time as drawing on the Bible, and in classical literature [[Lucretius]]; it is now considered Smith was influenced by [[Montesquieu]] on law and government. The theory on language and its typology over time has been seen as typical of Smith's historical approach; and even the foundation of his later well-known work on [[political economy]]. Caveats have also been entered, by David Raphael: it cannot be stretched to Smith's [[history of astronomy]]; and the term can be seen as a misnomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Simpson Ross|title=The Life of Adam Smith|pages=85–7|date=23 September 2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-161394-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon Bigelow|title=Fiction, Famine, and the Rise of Economics in Victorian Britain and Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BLIwbbcbuKcC&amp;pg=PA50|date=20 November 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-44085-1|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monboddo, on the other hand, wrote at length a conjectural history of language because he emphasised the history of [[manners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Salber Phillips|title=Society and Sentiment: Genres of Historical Writing in Britain, 1740–1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zZjGBmpk88C&amp;pg=PA151|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1-4008-2362-5|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Warburton]] had proposed a stadial conjectural history of writing in his ''[[Divine Legation of Moses]]'', a work supporting [[biblical authority]], around 1740. It was taken up in France after the translation in ''[[Essai sur les hiéroglyphes des Égyptiens]]''. Where writing moved from [[pictogram]]s to [[alphabet]]s, he saw language use as having moved analogously from [[gesture]]s to forms and figures of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jorge Cañizares-Esguerra|title=How to Write the History of the New World: Histories, Epistemologies, and Identities in the Eighteenth-century Atlantic World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JzIGYxOC1oUC&amp;pg=PA109|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4693-9|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The four stages theory==
The term "conjectural history" was not generally accepted in Stewart's time.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karen O'Brien|title=Narratives of Enlightenment: Cosmopolitan History from Voltaire to Gibbon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9bOow5IFUwC&amp;pg=PA133|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=5 June 1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-46533-5|pages=132–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an orthodox '''four stages theory''' of society, the stages being:

# [[hunter-gatherer|hunting]];
# [[pasturage]];
# [[agriculture]]; and 
# [[commerce]].

This ladder-like ordering was taken to be a strict, linear progression, or [[unilineal evolution]]. Some [[economic determinism]] applied, in the sense that the baseline of subsistence was assumed to have a serious effect on social matters. The stages were supposed to represent progress on a moral level, as well as that of economic complexity. French as well as Scottish Enlightenment writers subscribed to such a pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Rosen|title=On Voluntary Servitude: False Consciousness and the Theory of Ideology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FBBEWlGOhSMC&amp;pg=PA117|accessdate=1 March 2013|year=1996|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-63779-5|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of this type of theory (three or four stages) is attributed to a number of European writers from the 1750s onwards, such as Adam Smith, [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] and [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ter Ellingson|title=The Myth of the Noble Savage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqE3IhkeWToC&amp;pg=PA159|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=17 December 2000|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-92592-2|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Scottish context it appears in works from 1758 by [[David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes|David Dalrymple]] and [[Lord Kames]]; it has been argued that their source was the Edinburgh lectures of Smith on [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Knud Haakonssen|title=The Cambridge Companion to Adam Smith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G6bhhU3iyhIC&amp;pg=PA225|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=6 March 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77924-1|page=225 note 18.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France it was published at much the same time, also, by [[Claude Pierre Goujet]], [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]], and [[François Quesnay]].&lt;ref name="FitzpatrickJones2004"/&gt; Smith's "[[natural progress of opulence]]" is a closely related theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Noggle|title=The Temporality of Taste in Eighteenth-Century British Writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mUT8187WaxkC&amp;pg=PA165|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=9 February 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-964243-4|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representative works==
Besides Adam Smith, prominent Scottish authors in the field of conjectural history included [[Adam Ferguson]], David Hume, Lord Kames, [[John Millar (philosopher)|John Millar]], and [[Lord Monboddo]], writing from the later 1750s to later 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Zachs |title=Without Regard to Good Manners: A biography of Gilbert Stuart (1743–1786) |year=1992 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-0319-0 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith, Kames and Millar were content to adhere to the four stage theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Porscha Fermanis|title=John Keats and the Ideas of the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JhfJN8IzDOgC&amp;pg=PA67|accessdate=1 March 2013|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-3780-5|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monboddo's stadial history was more complex, and very much more controversial. He included [[primate]]s and [[feral children]] as material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Broadie|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Scottish Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtda5SVxaF4C&amp;pg=PA82|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=10 April 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00323-0|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson in his ''History of America'' moves between narrative and conjectural history.&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adam Ferguson, ''An Essay on the History of Civil Society'' (1767)===
{{details|An Essay on the History of Civil Society}}
Ferguson in this work attempted a rigorous identification of the hunter stage with the so-called [[barbarian]] or savage, and was very alive to the whole scheme as full of tensions within human possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Pocock, pp. 330–5.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued against the [[foundation story]] in the style of classical history, proposing instead that [[unintended consequences]] could have more to do with the "establishment" of a society than a self-conscious law-giver.&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Millar, ''Observations concerning the Distinction of Ranks in Society'' (1771)===
Millar argued in terms of a "system of manners" associated with each of the four stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Chandler|title=England in 1819: The Politics of Literary Culture and the Case of Romantic Historicism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RqWLrZ3UEvcC&amp;pg=PA128|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=26 June 1999|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-10109-5|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also discussed the advance of freedom, and denounced slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn Avery Hunt|title=Measuring Time, Making History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A6nrL1XxpGYC&amp;pg=PA60|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=28 February 2008|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-9776-14-2|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; As property became more complex, it followed that government did so also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Roy |authorlink=Roy Porter |title=Enlightenment|year=2001 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-025028-2 |page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poovey states that this work makes apparent the relationship of conjectural history with the [[experimental moral philosophy]] of [[Thomas Reid]] and [[George Turnbull (theologian)|George Turnbull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Poovey|title=A History of the Modern Fact: Problems of Knowledge in the Sciences of Wealth and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cf7ProAtFBkC&amp;pg=PA223|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 December 1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-67525-1|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lord Kames, ''Sketches of the History of Man'' (1774)===
Kames has been called the leader of Scottish conjectural history, and had objections he expressed in correspondence to both Rousseau and the approach of [[Montesquieu]], as reducing the role of human nature, which he thought was not a constant but the goal of the investigation.&lt;ref name="Carhart2007"/&gt; The connection was that conjectural history was to be used as a framework of a discussion of [[natural law]].&lt;ref name="O'Brien"/&gt; In writing to [[Basel]] in search of a suitable opponent to Rousseau, Kames prompted a work from [[Isaak Iselin]], ''Ueber die Geschichte der Menschheit'' (1764), which is also a conjectural history.&lt;ref name="Carhart2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Knud Haakonssen|title=The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6ExSHrknywC&amp;pg=PA1140|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86743-6|page=1140 note 62.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later developments==

===The tradition comes to an end===
Mainstream conjectural and philosophical history, in the Scottish style, hardly survived as a living tradition into the 1790s. Works went out of print; younger authors such as [[John Adams (writer)|John Adams]], [[William Alexander (physician)|William Alexander]] and [[John Logan (minister)|John Logan]] failed to renew the ideas, with Alexander's ''History of Women'' (1779) being criticised as shallow.&lt;ref name="Broich"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ulrich Broich|title=Reactions to Revolutions: The 1790s and Their Aftermath|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vLvLPSwF-bIC&amp;pg=PA232|accessdate=3 March 2013|year=2007|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-8258-7427-8|pages=232–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Salber Phillips|title=Society and Sentiment: Genres of Historical Writing in Britain, 1740–1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zZjGBmpk88C&amp;pg=PA163|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2362-8|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dugald Stewart's formulation of conjectural history was published in 1794, in his ''Account'' of Adam Smith for the ''Transactions'' of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Smith|title=The Glasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith: III: Essays on Philosophical Subjects: With Dugald Stewart's 'Account of Adam Smith':|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=48IO3cLjaWcC&amp;pg=PA268|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=1 May 1980|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-159117-4|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question has been raised as to Stewart's intention then in describing the tradition in that way, and [[John Burrow]] has argued that he wished to dissociate Smith from political radicalism.&lt;ref name="Burrow1966"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Wyon Burrow|title=Evolution and Society: A Study in Victorian Social Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUM4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA54|accessdate=4 March 2013|year=1966|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-04393-9|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where stadial theory appeared in later authors, the original thrust was distorted.&lt;ref name="Broich"/&gt; Hopfl has said that the heirs were [[James Mill]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Auguste Comte]].&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Hawthorne writes instead of the historical/sociological insights of the Scots being lost in the British context, despite the "tension between a 'natural' account of civil society and a developing sense of the factual importance and moral difficulties of individualism" having become apparent, to [[utilitarianism]] and vaguer [[evolutionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Geoffrey Hawthorn |title=Enlightenment and Despair: A History of Social Theory |year=1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-33721-6 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious opposition===
The ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', in its [[Encyclopædia Britannica Second Edition|second edition]] but particularly in its [[Encyclopædia Britannica Third Edition|third edition]] (1797), attacked the premises of conjectural history from a biblical angle. In the second edition [[James Tytler]] opposed the polygenist approach of Kames. The third edition, under the editorship of [[George Gleig]], featured "Savage" as a new topic, and expanded articles "Society" and "Moral philosophy". Cross-referenced to theological and biblical topics, and to articles by [[David Doig]] who had answered Kames with ''Two Letters on the Savage State'' from 1775/6, these articles in particular argued the orthodox Christian case. [[Robert Heron (writer)|Robert Heron]] contributed to the article "Society", and took aim at the four stages theory, claiming polygenism followed from it (in contradiction to the Bible). Further, the assumption of a baseline state of savagery also seemed to Heron to be implicated with polygenism; and he with Doig attacked the assumption as echoing [[Lucretius]] and [[Democritus]], and godless materialist [[spontaneous generation]] of humankind, implicit in the whole idea of conjectural history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aa.vv.|title=Storia della Storiografia.

===Relationship to antiquarianism===
Conjectural argument had a bad name in 18th century British [[antiquarian]] circles. An austere and sceptical approach centred on facts, as adopted by [[Richard Gough (antiquarian)|Richard Gough]] and [[James Douglas (antiquary)|James Douglas]], was favoured in the second half of the century.&lt;ref name="Sweet"&gt;Sweet, pp. 20–3.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the interpretations of the stadial theory were quite welcome, and while popularised by the Scottish school, did not seem innovative in the sense of a break with Early Modern historiography, and concerns with natural law and [[civic humanism]]. The urban history of [[John Trussel]] was a precursor. The discussion of the breakdown of the [[feudal system]] was a topic of considerable antiquarian interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosemary Sweet|title=Writing of Urban Histories in 18th Century England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n32ZwLcgaFUC&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=3 March 2013|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-820669-9|pages=143–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadial history was embraced by [[Thomas Pownall]].&lt;ref name="Sweet"/&gt;

===Conjectural history of peoples===
[[Charles Athanase Walckenaer]] in 1798 took up the four stage theory, augmented to five stages, by dividing "hunting" into "gathering" followed by a pure hunting stage. This was an effort to classify peoples of the world by development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin S. Staum|title=Labeling People: French Scholars on Society, Race, and Empire, 1815–1848|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJfz4ptLD0kC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=20 August 2003|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-7124-2|pages=13–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early anthropology carried into the 19th century assumptions about the search for origins of civilisation, and unilineal evolution, as appropriate tools for investigating societies. It was widely assumed, further, that current "peoples" were a window into the past. These approaches were seen in [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]. Eventually, in the 20th century, field work and [[structural functionalism]] led to a rejection of the whole paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Giorgio Ausenda|title=After Empire: Towards an Ethnology of Europe's Barbarians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqvhYaHrryEC&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=5 March 2013|date=1 February 2003|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=978-0-85115-853-2|pages=96–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Crippen Point site''' is a [[Coles Creek culture]] [[archaeological site]] located in [[Sharkey County, Mississippi]]. It is the archaeological [[type site]] of the Crippen Point phase(1050 to 1200 CE) for Late Coles Creek culture in the Lower [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] valley. The phase marks a significant change in the cultural history of the area. Population increased dramatically and there is strong evidence of a growing cultural and political complexity by this portion of the Coles Creek sequence. Although many of the classic traits of [[chiefdom]] societies are not yet manifested, by 1000 CE the formation of simple elite polities had begun. Sites for this phase are found in [[Arkansas]], [[Louisiana]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Texas]]. After the Crippen Point phase the [[Plaquemine culture]] period begins.

'''''Critical Path''''' is a book written by US author and inventor [[R. Buckminster Fuller]] with the assistance of [[Kiyoshi Kuromiya]]. First published in 1981, it is alongside ''[[Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth]]'' one of Fuller's best-known works. Vast in its scope, it describes Fuller's own vision of the development of human [[civilization]], [[economic history]], and his highly original [[economic ideology]] based, amongst other things, on his detailed description of why [[scarcity]] of resources need no longer be a decisive factor in [[global politics]].

== Overview ==
The following is a list of the main claims and opinions presented in the book, reported without discussion or criticism.

=== Part One ===
The first part of the book explains the history and present state of the global economy.

=== Chapter 1 - Speculative Prehistory of Humanity ===
[[Human|Human life]] began in the atolls of the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], where the average sea temperature is closest to that of the human body (p.&amp;nbsp;6). Rather than [[evolution|evolving]] from simpler organisms, humanity was of extraterrestrial origin and other organisms evolved from us (p.&amp;nbsp;7). From this base, humanity developed [[boat-building]] in [[Southeast Asia]] and colonised the rest of the planet (p.&amp;nbsp;15). There is evidence that the [[Bronze Age]] began in Southeast Asia (p.&amp;nbsp;17). Fuller's [[Dymaxion map|Dymaxion World Map]] is used to show the distribution of humanity over the Earth's surface. Over half the population lives in the regions watered by the [[Himalaya]]n glaciers (p.&amp;nbsp;20).

=== Chapter 2 - Humans in Universe ===
Our knowledge of the [[spherical Earth|spherical shape of the Earth]] is central to our understanding of ecology (p.&amp;nbsp;34). This knowledge probably originated in prehistoric times, was certainly known to the [[Ancient Greeks]], but was then suppressed for centuries by organised religion because it was incompatible with the official story of a [[Heaven]] above and a [[Hell]] below (p.&amp;nbsp;43). There has been an evolution of religious ideas from those of the Egyptian pyramid-builders, whose ambition was to deliver a single individual, the [[pharaoh]], into the afterlife, to the modern belief that everybody has a right to enjoy life on Earth (p.&amp;nbsp;51).

=== Chapter 3 - Legally Piggily ===
{{quote|Fire is the Sun unwinding from the tree's log.|Fuller|p.62}}
Human history has been shaped by the continual growth and success of greed. [[City-state]]s were the first institutions to make organised use of extortion (p.&amp;nbsp;68). This was then followed by the growth of [[international trade]], which appropriates the wealth of the planet for its own ends. Corruption in the form of "lawyer-capitalism" has led the U.S.A. to become effectively bankrupt (p.&amp;nbsp;114). Government [[subsidies]] given to corporations amount to [[socialism]] (p.&amp;nbsp;101).
{{quote|Eventually the U.S. taxpayers will be asked to make "free-of-risk" bail-outs of "private" enterprises|Fuller|p.87}}

=== Chapter 4 - Self-Disciplines of Buckminster Fuller ===
Fuller's diary, the "[[Dymaxion Chronofile|Chronofile]]", is intended to show how much a single human being with little money can do to influence world affairs (p.&amp;nbsp;128). The mechanical principle of [[precession]] is used as a metaphor for the ability of a person to influence the world by applying pressure in an unconventional direction (p.&amp;nbsp;144). Fuller's religious beliefs are explained (p.&amp;nbsp;151).

Fuller observed that when he did things for the benefit of others, it had a positive effect on his life, but when he did things merely for his personal benefit, the outcome was negative. This eventually led him to the proposition that if he dedicated his life to the betterment of humanity, he would achieve the greatest positive outcome. So he decided to live his entire life as an experiment to prove or disprove this proposition. He writes (p.&amp;nbsp;145):

{{quote|I assumed that nature would "evaluate" my work as I went along. If I was doing what nature wanted done, and if I was doing it in promising ways, permitted by nature's principles, I would find my work being economically sustained—and vice versa, in which latter negative case I must quickly cease doing what I had been doing and seek logically alternative courses until I found the new course that nature signified her approval of by providing for its physical support. Wherefore, I concluded that I would be informed by nature if I proceeded in the following manner:

(A) committed myself, my wife, and our infant daughter directly to the design, production, and demonstration of artifact accommodation of the most evident but as-yet-unattended-to human-environment-advantaging physical evolutionary tasks, and (B) paid no attention to "earning a living" in humanity's established economic system, yet (C) found my family's and my own life's needs being unsolicitedly provided for by seemingly pure happenstance and always only "in the nick of time," and (D) being provided for "only coincidentally," yet found (E) that this only "coincidentally," unbudgetable, yet realistic support persisted, and did so (F) only so long as I continued spontaneously to commit myself unreservedly to the task of developing relevant artifacts, and if I (G) never tried to persuade humanity to alter its customs and viewpoints and never asked anyone to listen to me and spoke informatively to others only when they asked me so to do, and if I (H) never undertook competitively to produce artifacts others were developing, and attended only to that which no others attended

''then'' I could tentatively conclude that my two assumptions were valid: (1) that nature might economically sustain human activity that served directly in the "mainstream" realization of essential cosmic regeneration, which had hitherto been accomplished only through seeming "right-angled" side effects of the chromosomically focused biological creatures; and (2) that the generalized physical law of precessional behaviors does govern socioeconomic behaviors as do also the generalized laws of acceleration and ephemeralization.}}

=== Chapter 5 - The Geoscope ===
The Geoscope is a large-scale, animated globe of the Earth intended to help people visualise the spatial and temporal patterns of human activity, either in real time or replayed at different speeds. If the human mind is presented with all of this information at once, it should be able to use its visual pattern-detecting abilities to solve complex problems such as weather-forecasting, resource conflicts, and wars (p.&amp;nbsp;183). Data for the Geoscope can come from the world maps produced by the USA, using radio triangulation, during and after World War II (p.&amp;nbsp;184). Geodesic domes will be built to enclose entire cities (p.&amp;nbsp;179). [[Afghanistan]] was the heartland of the [[Cold War]] world, as it gave the [[USSR]] the potential of a route through [[Iran]] to the [[Indian Ocean]] (p.&amp;nbsp;194).

=== Chapter 6 - World Game ===
The [[World Game]] is a simulation of global economic activity. Computers can be used to calculate the optimal answer to any economic, technological or social question. The computers will tell us that the true cost to the environment of using fossil fuels is prohibitive, and renewable energy should be used instead. The true energy cost of a gallon of gasoline is more than one million (1980) US dollars. The amount of scrap metals in circulation means that no more mining is necessary (p.&amp;nbsp;205). A global electrical supply grid will enable more efficient use of energy, and make intermittent renewable energy more practical (p.&amp;nbsp;202).

=== Part Two ===
This part of the book explains Fuller's plan to set humanity on the path to a sustainable existence with no need to fight over resources.

=== Chapter 7 - Critical Path: Part One ===
Education is key to improving humanity's living conditions (p.&amp;nbsp;232). The USSR tried to destabilise the US education system by inciting its students to riot (p.&amp;nbsp;236). The [[Apollo Project]] had a [[Critical path method|critical path]] of two million tasks, one million of which required new technological solutions (p.&amp;nbsp;248). Fuller has applied a similar project-planning approach to the saving of humanity, and has created a list of critical-path items (p.&amp;nbsp;248).

{{quote|by 1985 we should be able to transmit humans around the globe by radio scanning or an equivalently unexpected means|Fuller|p.245}}
{{quote|We are being taught by all the foregoing to assume as closely as possible the viewpoint, the patience, and the competence of God.|Fuller|p.251}}

=== Chapter 8 - Critical Path: Part Two ===
Unlike the Apollo Project, the critical-path items in the project to save humanity can all be accomplished with existing technologies (p.&amp;nbsp;253). A global video education system must be developed (p.&amp;nbsp;265).
{{quote|I am certain that none of the world's problems...have any hope of solution except through total democratic society's becoming thoroughly...self-educated.|Fuller|p.266}}

=== Chapter 9 - Critical Path: Part Three ===
Corn is wasted in generating unnecessarily fatty but more profitable beef (p.&amp;nbsp;272). 
{{quote|Billions of dollars of government subsidies now go to the conglomerate farmland owners.|Fuller|p.274}}
{{quote|The drive to make money...seeks to monopolize order while leaving...disorder to overwhelm others.|Fuller|p.276}}
In Los Angeles, private-incinerator and later car-pollution laws were passed to shift the blame for smog from industry to citizens (p.&amp;nbsp;279). 
{{quote|Today, big business ... is completely transnational. Now only the world's people are left bound within their respective 150 national pens.|Fuller|p.285}}
In 1929 the USSR used its gold wealth relative to the USA's poverty to pay United States industry to set up industries in USSR, in USSR's first three [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|5-year plans]] (p.&amp;nbsp;289).

=== Chapter 10 - Critical Path: Part Four ===
{{quote|Having committed ourselves to solving humanity's problems with artifacts...|Fuller|p.309}}
The first task in humanity's critical path is to build a global electricity grid (p.&amp;nbsp;309). The second task is to provide movable dwellings for all - city-sized and family-sized domes (p.&amp;nbsp;310). Fuller has the following designs ready for production: the [[Fly's Eye Dome]] (p.&amp;nbsp;311); [[Old Man River's City project]], [[East St. Louis]] (p.&amp;nbsp;315); Raleigh cotton mill (p.&amp;nbsp;325); Growth House - sustainable greenhouse (p.&amp;nbsp;329); O-Volving shelves (p.&amp;nbsp;331); tetrahedral floating city (p.&amp;nbsp;333); Cloud Nines - spherical floating cities (p.&amp;nbsp;336); 8,000-foot Tokyo Tower (p.&amp;nbsp;338); containerised passenger air travel (p.&amp;nbsp;340).

== Concepts ==
* '''[[Critical path method|Critical path]].''' The title of the book is a term used in [[project planning]]. To estimate the completion date of a project, a chart is drawn showing all of the necessary sub-tasks and their durations, placed in chronological order. The last task cannot begin until all of tasks on which it depends have been completed. These tasks depend, in turn, on other tasks. It is usually possible to draw numerous paths through the chart from beginning to end, but it is the longest path, called the ''critical path'', that determines the time that the project will take to complete. The book refers frequently to the [[Apollo Project]], which was planned using this method. Fuller's plan to reorganise the global economy in a sustainable way also has a critical path, which is identified in the book.
* '''[[Spaceship Earth]].''' The Earth's material resources, like those of a spaceship, are finite. The book explains that early humans did not understand this, because the Earth seemed like a boundless flat surface. We now know that the Earth is a sphere, and this fact should inform all of our decisions.
* '''Personal integrity.''' ''Critical Path'' is part manifesto, part autobiography. Fuller admits in one place that this is "egostistical" (p.&amp;nbsp;378), but excuses this by saying that he wants to show not just his conclusions, but also the thought processes that led to them. He believes that every person must think for himself and take as little as possible on trust (p.xi).

== Criticism ==
{{quote|Mr. Fuller has always made himself easy to dismiss by wandering off the deep end of optimism, but a reading of ''Critical Path'' shows that the author, like Karl Marx, arrived at his vision of the ideal only after a serious attempt to understand the evolution of human affairs.|James Traub|"Nonfiction in Brief", ''[[The New York Times]]'', published April 19, 1981; accessed 2010-07-21}}

'''Dalitstan.org''' was a [[Dalit]] [[Advocacy group|advocacy]] website active until mid-2006,&lt;ref name="Anand2011"&gt;{{cite book | author=Dibyesh Anand | title=Hindu Nationalism in India and the Politics of Fear | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lbpfAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT34 | date=15 October 2011 | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan | isbn=978-0-230-36263-5 | pages=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of 18 websites that were blocked by the Indian government following the [[11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings]].&lt;ref name=indiatimes&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-07-19/india/27816956_1_govt-blocks-check-terror-websites| title = Govt blocks 18 sites to check hate messages | date = 2006-07-19 | newspaper = The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website claimed to be run by '''Dalitstan''', a "Human Rights Organization working for the Upliftment of Dalits, the [[Untouchability|Untouchables]] of India".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Anjana Narayan | author2=Bandana Purkayastha | title=Living Our Religions: Hindu and Muslim South Asian American Women Narrate Their Experiences | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cDF7Ow_FJ8kC&amp;pg=PA270 | year=2009 | publisher=Kumarian Press | isbn=978-1-56549-270-7 | pages=270–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that [[-stan]] is a [[suffix]] for "place of"&lt;ref name="About.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson |first=Bridget |title='Stan Countries – What the Suffix 'Stan' Means |publisher=[[About.com]] |url=http://worldnews.about.com/od/centralandeastasia/f/stans.htm |accessdate=October 9, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FVca0q9H?url=http://worldnews.about.com/od/centralandeastasia/f/stans.htm |archivedate=2013-03-30 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "country",&lt;ref name ="Etymonline"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=-stan|title = -stan|first = Douglas|last = Harper|authorlink = Douglas Harper|publisher = [[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|accessdate = January 18, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101195443/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=-stan|archivedate=2014-01-01|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; appearing in many [[place names]] throughout [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[South Asia]]. Dalitstan would mean "place or country of the [[Dalits]]".

==Claims and counter-claims==
The website claimed that the Dalits were the original people of India who created the [[Harappan civilization]], and described the [[Brahmin]]s as the descendants of the [[Indo-Aryan migration debate|Aryan invaders]] who enslaved them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Judith E. Walsh | title=A Brief History of India | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iekF9X3OwwMC&amp;pg=PA15 | date=1 January 2006 | publisher=Infobase Publishing | isbn=978-1-4381-0825-4 | pages=15–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dibyesh Anand of the [[University of Westminster]] described Dalitstan.org as a Dalit nationalist group that also acted as a forum for anti-India Christian and Muslim advocacy.&lt;ref name=Anand&gt;{{cite book|last=Anand|first=Dibyesh|title=Hindu Nationalism in India and the Politics of Fear|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave-Macmillan|isbn=978-0230603851|pages=56–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blocked by the Indian government==
Dalitistan.org was among the 18 websites that were blocked in India by the Ministry of Telecommunications of the Government in July 2006, in a bid to check terror and hate messages on the Internet following the [[11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings]].&lt;ref name=indiatimes /&gt;

==History of domain==
The website was launched in 1999, with the domain registered by Helen Heklund, with an address in [[Granbury, Texas]]. The website was taken down sometime after May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archived Results from Jan 01, 1996 - latest for dalitstan.org |url=http://dalitstan.org/ |work=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510134217/http://www.dalitstan.org/ |archivedate=2006-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The domain registration lapsed, and was subsequently purchased by an unrelated party.

'''Diyarbakır Fortress''', is a historical fortress in [[Sur, Diyarbakır|Sur]], [[Diyarbakır]], [[Turkey]]. It consists of an inner fortress and an outer fortress.&lt;ref name="kulturvarliklari"&gt;[http://www.kulturvarliklari.gov.tr/TR,44403/diyarbakir-kalesi-ve-surlari-diyarbakir.html "Diyarbakır Kalesi ve Surları (Diyarbakır)"].&amp;#x20;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The main gates of the fortress are: Dağ (Mountain) Gate, [[Urfa]] Gate, [[Mardin]] Gate and Yeni (New) Gate.&lt;ref name="kulturvarliklari" /&gt; The walls come from the old Roman city of [[Amida_(Mesopotamia)|Amida]] and were constructed in their present form in the mid-fourth century AD by the emperor [[Constantius II]]. They are the widest and longest complete defensive walls in the world after only the [[Great Wall of China]] (the Theodosian Walls for example are longer in length, but are not continuous)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zaman.com.tr/sehir_diyarbakir-surlari_562160.html "Diyarbakır Surları"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523061446/http://www.zaman.com.tr/sehir_diyarbakir-surlari_562160.html|date=2015-05-23}}.&amp;#x20;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diyarbakirkulturturizm.gov.tr/TR,56899/surlar.html "Surlar"].&amp;#x20;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNESCO]] added the building to their tentative list on 2000,&lt;ref name="kulturvarliklari" /&gt; and listed it as a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2015 along with [[Hevsel Gardens]].

== Conservation ==
Though the walls and fortress itself were once compared to the Great Wall of China&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allaboutturkey.com/diyarbakir.htm|title=Diyarbakir|last=|first=|date=|website=allaboutturkey.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, this started to change as wars broke out during 2015&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/11/diyarbakirs-urban-plans-risk-destroying-heritage.html|title=Heartbreak in Turkey's Diyarbakir as development transforms ancient Sur|last=|first=|date=November 21, 2017|website=al-monitor.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;(&amp;Al-monitor); walls from the fortress collapsed, along with a mosque, two churches, and the homes of many civilians, forcing some sections to be abandoned&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

As the war continued, the government of Turkey and UNESCO jointly began a reconstruction and preservation effort, intending to complete it within two years, starting with the demolition of part of the city. Historic sites were spared, and in June 2015, UNESCO added the fortress and Hensel Gardens Cultural Landscape to UNESCO's World Heritage List. UNESCO's main focus was to protect the environment of the land itself, more than the heritage of the land&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/historic-structures-damaged-in-diyarbakir--89474|title=Historic Structures damaged in Diyarbakir|last=|first=|date=October 7, 2015|website=hurriyetdailynews.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. And the Prime Minister himself also spoke of plans to reconstruct the city walls as a great tourist attraction intended to resemble Paris; this provoked considerable controversy in Diyarbakir, with some locals arguing that they would lose their ancient culture heritage&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

== Architecture ==
Diyarbakir fortress is constructed with stone, black basalt, and adobe, and has gone through countless renovations; the basalt fortifications are exceptionally durable, one reason why the structure has remained relatively intact for over 2000 years. Diyarbakir fortress is among the best surviving examples of a castle or fort built with a natural feature like a cliffside or body of water on one side as a boundary. The walls have a symbolic function as well as a defensive purpose, with inscriptions on the inner city's walls (the fort) that testify to the city of Diyarbakir's history.&lt;ref name="castle"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-06-01|title=Castle architecture in Anatolia: Fortifications of Diyarbakir|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209526351300023X|journal=Frontiers of Architectural Research|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|pages=209–221|doi=10.1016/j.foar.2013.04.003|issn=2095-2635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Diyarbakir Fortress can be divided into two categories, the bailey and the citadel. In the northeast, the citadel contains the first settlement inside Diyarbakir, and those walls stretch 598 meters long. The bailey houses a tower and the city walls, surrounding the much more urban walled city region of Diyarbakir. Most of these walls are constructed with traditional masonry and construction styles; the towers consist of 2-4 floors and are 4.4 meters thick on the ground floor and get thinner on higher floors.&lt;ref name="castle" /&gt;

The castle plans reveal the dominance of two different building forms, circular and tetragonal. The walls were divided into five groups, four of which contained the towers around the four main gates, while the fifth contained the citadel towers. It has been found that 65 of the original 82 towers still remain on the outside of the city's walls and 18 of the citadel's towers remain today. Due to cultural differences, the fort has undergone some modifications. The fort was reconstructed, repaired and or heightened over time. However, the overall typology has remained constant in the fort's renovations.&lt;ref name="castle" /&gt;

== Construction ==
Diyarbakir fortress was first built in 297 AD by Romans under the order of Constantius II. Over the next 1500+ years, these walls were expanded and fortified using volcanic rock from the surrounding region. There are four main gates and 82 watch towers on the walls. &lt;ref name="thekurdishproject.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thekurdishproject.org/history-and-culture/kurdish-history/historical-sites-in-kurdistan/diyarbakir-city-walls/|title=Diyarbakir City Walls - The Kurdish Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Diyarbakir city walls have an ancient history dating back to the Romans. The towers at Diyarbakir were mainly built by the Romans and later reconstructed by the Ottomans when they took over the city in the 15th and 16th centuries. During the defeat of the Safavids at Diyarbakir, the Ottomans destroyed the walls with the use of cannons &lt;ref name="thekurdishproject.org"/&gt; and therefore had to be rebuilt. Today, the walls are largely intact, and form a ring around the old city that is over 3 miles in circumference. The walls are over 33 feet high and are about 10-16 feet thick. &lt;ref name="thekurdishproject.org"/&gt; They are the widest and longest complete defensive walls in the world after only the Great Wall of China.

== History ==
Diyarbakir Fortress was built, used, and rebuilt during the Roman and Ottoman periods, including the Diyarbakir city walls that measure up to 53 meters long. There are both inner and outer walls; the site also has several gates and towers. Included on the walls are about 63 inscriptions from various historical periods &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebruliturizm.com/4140/diyarbakir-fortress-and-hevsel-gardens-cultural-landscape/|title=Diyarbakır Fortress and Hevsel Gardens Cultural Landscape (2015) {{!}} EBRULI TOURISM- IZMIR-TURKEY|website=www.ebruliturizm.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;including remains from the Hurrians, Medes, Romans, Sassanians, Byzantines, Marwanids (Kurds), Ayyubids (Kurds), and Ottomans.

About one-third of the historic Old Town was deliberaitely destroyed by the Turkish state after the clashes ended, damaging the ancient city irreversibly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3443">The '''Fatima massacre''' refers to an incident in [[Fátima, Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], where 30 prisoners were illegally detained, drugged and shot. Afterwards, their bodies were then dynamited, on August 20, 1976.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite news |title=Argentine police get life term in 'dirty war' case |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=July 11, 2008 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN11412259 |accessdate=2009-09-19 |first=Hilary |last=Burke}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Ferguson |title=The Fatima Massacre |date=July 30, 2008 |url=http://www.truthout.org/article/the-fatima-massacre |publisher=''[[Truthout.org|truthout]]'' |accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==

Shortly after four o'clock on the morning of August 20, a loud explosion woke inhabitants of Fatima. Workers at a nearby brick foundry arrived on scene and claimed they had found human remains scattered over an area of one hundred yards, presumably a result of the explosion. Almost immediately the area was fenced by soldiers. Photojournalists who had taken photos were kidnapped. The soldiers and civilian staff collected the body parts and loaded them onto a truck of the Municipality of [[Pilar, Buenos Aires|Pilar]].{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole paragraph; these are specific claims and the source doesn't provide any of these details|date=November 2015}}

According to the police, the victims were thirty people, ten women and twenty men, including some teenagers. Only five could be identified at the time. The bodies of the unidentified victims were buried in Derqui Pte Cemetery, where they were exhumed years later for identification.

The Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team was able to identify eleven more victims. One of the first was Susana Pedrini of [[Bronzel]], after whom they named a street in the center of Pilar, specifically in the square near the water tank.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for this; neither quoted source mentions this|date=November 2015}}.

Half of the victims could be identified by family and friends through the work of the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team.

On July 11, 2008, two former Argentine police officers were sentenced to life in prison for their role in the killings.&lt;ref name=reuters /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amnesty International Report 2009 - Argentina |publisher=[[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,ARG,4562d94e2,4a1fae02c,0.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009082709/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,ARG,4562d94e2,4a1fae02c,0.html |archivedate=2012-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ghazni Minarets''' are two elaborately decorated [[minaret]] towers located in [[Ghazni]] city, central [[Afghanistan]]. They were built in middle of the twelfth century and are the only surviving elements of the mosque of Bahram Shah.&lt;ref name="LaterGhaznavidsBook"&gt;C.E. Bosworth, ''The Later Ghaznavids'', (Columbia University Press, 1977), 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The two minarets are 600 meters (1968 feet) apart and lie in an open plain, east of Ghazni city.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ghazni Towers Documentation Project: History |url=https://eca.state.gov/files/bureau/ghazni-towers/historyb.html |website=eca.state.gov |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both minarets of Ghazni are 20 metres (66 feet)&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; tall and built of fired mud [[brick]]. The surface of the towers are decorated beautifully with intricate geometric patterns and [[Quran|Qurunic]] verses on elaborate [[terracotta]] tiles. In 1960's, both towers were fitted with sheet metal roofs in a limited preservation effort.&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ghazni Minarets |url=https://www.wmf.org/project/ghazni-minarets |website=wmf.org |publisher=World Monuments Fund |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LaterGhaznavidsBook"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The 12th century minarets are the most famous monuments of Ghazni city and are among the last surviving remnants of the great [[Ghaznavid Empire]]. The two minarets are called, '''Mas'ud III Minaret''' and '''Bahram Shah Minaret''' after the ruler who built them, Masud III (A.D. 1099-1115) and [[Bahram-Shah of Ghazna|Bahram Shah]] (A.D. 1118-1157).&lt;ref name="ab"&gt;{{cite web |title=072. Ghazni: Bahram Shah Minaret |url=https://www.cemml.colostate.edu/cultural/09476/afgh05-072.html |website=cemml.colostate.edu |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excavated palace of Mas'ud III lies nearby to the towers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Atkinson1839.jpg|left|thumb|A 1839 painting shows the cylindrical upper sections of the minarets before their destruction in 1902 earthquake.]]
The minarets were taller before the upper sections were damaged and destroyed over time. Part of the Masud III minaret top was destroyed in an earthquake in 1902.&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LaterGhaznavidsBook"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Threats==
Ghazni Minarets are not well preserved or protected. Both towers are in danger from natural elements and the political instability in Afghanistan. There is no basic security measures in place to prevent vandalism and the towers are in need of new roofing to prevent water infiltration into the towers.&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  

The towers surface intricate geometric patterns and [[Quran|Quranic]] inscriptions are deteriorating rapidly with exposure to rain and snow. They are further affected by the nearby road and the area is subject to periodic flooding.&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2013}}
'''Historical negationism'''&lt;ref&gt;The term "negationism" derives from the French [[neologism]] ''négationnisme'', denoting Holocaust denial.(Kornberg, Jacques. [https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-494822161/the-future-of-a-negation-reflections-on-the-question The Future of a Negation: Reflections on the Question of Genocide.(Review) (book review)], [[Shofar]], January 2001). It is now also sometimes used for more general political historical revisionism as [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001238/123862e.pdf (PDF) UNESCO against racism world conference] 31 August – 7 September 2001 "Given the ignorance with which it is treated, the slave trade comprises one of the most radical forms of historical negationism."&lt;br /&gt;
Pascale Bloch has written in ''International law: Response to Professor Fronza's The punishment of Negationism'' (Accessed ProQuest Database, 12 October 2011) that:
{{quote| "[R]evisionists" are understood as "negationists" in order to differentiate them from "historical revisionists" since their goal is either to prove that the Holocaust did not exist or to introduce confusion regarding the victims and German executioners regardless of historical and scientific methodology and evidence. For those reasons, the term "revisionism" is often considered confusing since it conceals misleading ideologies that purport to avoid disapproval by presenting "revisions" of the past based on pseudo-scientific methods, while really they are a part of negationism.|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kriss Ravetto (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=pOyPsK8yClsC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;source=web&amp;ots=UemJokdA6a&amp;sig=hLmLmoTDNl1et_sWd8oPqHMvUXw&amp;hl=en The Unmaking of Fascist Aesthetics], University of Minnesota Press {{ISBN|0-8166-3743-1}}. p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; or '''[[denialism]]''' is an illegitimate distortion of the historical record. It is often imprecisely or intentionally incorrectly referred to as ''[[historical revisionism]]'', but that term also denotes a legitimate academic pursuit of re-interpretation of the historical record and questioning the accepted views.&lt;ref name="Berger-154"&gt;"The two leading critical exposés of Holocaust denial in the United States were written by historians [[Deborah Lipstadt]] (1993) and [[Michael Shermer]] and Alex Grobman (2000). These scholars make a distinction between historical revisionism and denial. Revisionism, in their view, entails a refinement of existing knowledge about an historical event, not a denial of the event itself, that comes through the examination of new empirical evidence or a re-examination or reinterpretation of existing evidence. Legitimate historical revisionism acknowledges a 'certain body of irrefutable evidence' or a 'convergence of evidence' that suggest that an event – like the black plague, American slavery, or the Holocaust – did in fact occur (Lipstadt 1993:21; Shermer &amp; Grobman 200:34). Denial, on the other hand, rejects the entire foundation of historical evidence.&amp;nbsp;... " Ronald J. Berger. ''Fathoming the Holocaust: A Social Problems Approach'', Aldine Transaction, 2002, {{ISBN|0-202-30670-4}}, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

In attempting to revise the past, illegitimate historical revisionism may use techniques inadmissible in proper historical discourse, such as presenting known forged documents as genuine; inventing ingenious but implausible reasons for distrusting genuine documents; attributing conclusions to books and sources that report the opposite; manipulating statistical series to support the given point of view; and deliberately mis-translating texts (in languages other than the revisionist's).&lt;ref name="Evans-145"&gt;''Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial'', by [[Richard J. Evans]], 2001, {{ISBN|0-465-02153-0}}. p. 145. The author is a professor of Modern History, at the [[University of Cambridge]], and was a major expert-witness in the ''Irving v. Lipstadt'' trial; the book presents his perspective of the trial, and the expert-witness report, including his research about the Dresden death count.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries, such as Germany, have criminalised the negationist revision of certain historical events, while others take a more cautious position for various reasons, such as protection of [[free speech]]; still others mandate negationist views.

Notable examples of negationism include [[Holocaust denial]], [[Armenian Genocide denial]], [[Japanese history textbook controversies|Japanese war crime denial]]&lt;ref name="Mehnert1952Marx"&gt;Klaus Mehnert, ''Stalin Versus Marx: the Stalinist historical doctrine'' (Translation of ''Weltrevolution durch Weltgeschichte'') Port Washington NY: Kennikat Press 1972 (1952), on the illegitimate use of history in the 1934–1952 period.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Markwick"&gt;Roger D. Markwick, ''Rewriting history in Soviet Russia : the politics of revisionist historiography, 1956–1974'' New York ; Basingstoke : Palgrave, 2001, on legitimate Soviet Historiography particularly in the post 1956 period.&lt;/ref&gt; and the denial of Soviet crimes such as the [[Holodomor]], [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invasion of Poland]], the [[Katyn massacre]], and the [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|forced deporations of Poles, Romanians/Moldovans, Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Tatars etc.]] 

In literature, the consequences of historical negationism have been imaginatively depicted in some [[social science fiction|works of fiction]], such as ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', by [[George Orwell]]. In modern times, negationism may spread via new media, such as the [[Internet]].

==Origin of the term==
The term "negationism" (''négationnisme'') was first coined by the French historian [[Henry Rousso]] in his 1987 book ''The Vichy Syndrome'' which looked at the French popular [[memory]] of [[Vichy France]] and the [[French Resistance]]. Rousso argued that it was necessary to distinguish between legitimate [[historical revisionism]] in [[Holocaust studies]] and politically-motivated denial of the Holocaust, which he termed negationism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finkielkraut|first1=Alain|title=The Future of a Negation: Reflections on the Question of Genocide|date=1998|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|isbn=978-0-8032-2000-3|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purposes==
Usually, the purpose of historical negation is to achieve a national, political aim, by transferring war-guilt, demonizing an enemy, providing an illusion of victory, or preserving a friendship.&lt;ref name="lass1"&gt;Harold D. Lasswell, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Propaganda_technique_in_the_world_war.html?id=e5PtAAAAMAAJ Propaganda Technique in World War I.] 1927, MIT Press, {{ISBN|0-262-62018-9}} pp. xxii–xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the purpose of a revised history is to sell more books or to attract attention with a newspaper headline.&lt;ref name="danc2"&gt;Matthew d'Ancona, [http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/api/version1/getDocCui?lni=3T2M-9PN0-00H1-F2PP&amp;csi=10939&amp;hl=t&amp;hv=t&amp;hnsd=f&amp;hns=t&amp;hgn=t&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true History men battle over Britain's future.] The Times, 9 May 1994; ProQuest Database (. Retrieved 12 October 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[James M. McPherson]] said that negationists would want revisionist history understood as, "a consciously-falsified or distorted interpretation of the past to serve partisan or ideological purposes in the present".&lt;ref name="mcphear1"&gt;McPherson disagrees with this as the sole definition of revisionist history – he argues rightly that revisionism (academically) is the 'lifeblood of history.' James McPherson. [http://www.historians.org/perspectives/issues/2003/0309/0309pre1.cfm Revisionist Historians]. Perspectives, 2003. American Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ideological influence===
{{See also|Social influence|War of ideas}}
The principal functions of negationist history are the abilities to control ideological influence and to control political influence.
In "History Men Battle over Britain's Future", Michael d’Ancona said that historical negationists "seem to have been given a collective task in [a] nation's cultural development, the full significance of which is emerging only now: To redefine [national] status in a changing world".&lt;ref name= "d'An"&gt;Matthew d'Ancona; [http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/api/version1/getDocCui?lni=3T2M-9PN0-00H1-F2PP&amp;csi=10939&amp;hl=t&amp;hv=t&amp;hnsd=f&amp;hns=t&amp;hgn=t&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true History men battle over Britain's future.] The Times, 9 May 1994; ProQuest Database (Retrieved 12 October 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; History is a social resource that contributes to shaping [[national identity]], culture, and the public memory. Through the study of history, people are imbued with a particular cultural identity; therefore, by negatively revising history, the negationist can craft a specific, ideological identity. Because historians are credited as people who single-mindedly pursue truth, by way of fact, negationist historians capitalize on the historian's [[Reputation|professional credibility]], and present their [[pseudohistory]] as true scholarship.&lt;ref name="Lasswell-51"&gt;{{cite book |first=Harold D. |last =Lasswell |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Propaganda_technique_in_the_world_war.html?id=e5PtAAAAMAAJ |title=Propaganda Technique in World War I.|year=1927 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-62018-9 | page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; By adding a measure of credibility to the work of revised history, the ideas of the negationist historian are more readily accepted in the public mind.&lt;ref name="Lasswell-51"/&gt; As such, professional historians recognize the revisionist practice of historical negationism as the work of "truth-seekers" finding different truths in the historical record to fit their political, social, and ideological contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lasswell|1927|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political influence===
History provides insight into past political policies and consequences, and thus assists people in extrapolating political implications for contemporary society. Historical negationism is applied to cultivate a specific [[political myth]]&amp;nbsp;– sometimes with official consent from the government&amp;nbsp;– whereby self-taught, amateur, and dissident academic [[historian]]s either manipulate or misrepresent historical accounts to achieve political ends. In the USSR (1917–91), the [[ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and [[Historiography in the Soviet Union|Soviet historiography]] treated [[reality]] and the [[party line (politics)|party line]] as the same [[Intellectualism|intellectual entity]];&lt;ref&gt;Taisia Osipova, "Peasant rebellions: Origin, Scope, Design and Consequences", in Vladimir N. Brovkin (ed.), ''The Bolsheviks in Russian Society: The Revolution and the Civil Wars'', Yale University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0-300-06706-2}}. pp. 154–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet historical negationism advanced a specific, political and ideological agenda about Russia and its place in world history.&lt;ref&gt;Roger D. Markwick, Donald J. Raleigh, ''Rewriting History in Soviet Russia: The Politics of Revisionist Historiography'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2001, {{ISBN|0-333-79209-2}}, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques of negationism==
Historical negationism applies the techniques of research, quotation, and presentation for [[deception]] of the reader and [[denial]] of the historical record. In support of the "revised history" perspective, the negationist historian uses [[false documents]] as genuine sources, presents specious reasons to distrust genuine documents, exploits published opinions, by quoting out of historical context, manipulates [[statistics]], and mistranslates texts in other languages.&lt;ref&gt;Tennent H. Bagley, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Spy_wars.html?id=Ng7myCguewAC Spy Wars]¸ Yale University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|0-300-12198-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-300-12198-8}}, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The revision techniques of historical negationism operate in the [[academic research|intellectual space]] of public debate for the advancement of a given interpretation of history and the cultural-perspective of the "revised history".&lt;ref name= "Dionne1"&gt;Dionne, E.J. Jr. [http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/api/version1/getDocCui?lni=3SJF-B8B0-002S-T1J1&amp;csi=8075&amp;hl=t&amp;hv=t&amp;hnsd=f&amp;hns=t&amp;hgn=t&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true Cold War Scholars Fault Stalin: Soviet Historians Lean to U.S. View]. The Washington Post. 26 July 1990. LexisNexis Database (Retrieved 12 October 2011). First Section, p. A3.&lt;/ref&gt; As a document, the revised history is used to negate the validity of the factual, documentary record, and so reframe explanations and perceptions of the discussed historical event, in order to deceive the reader, the listener, and the viewer; therefore, historical negationism functions as a technique of [[propaganda]].&lt;ref name="Nargor1"&gt;Nagorski, Andrew. [http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/api/version1/getDocCui?lni=4S1C-XM90-TX2J-20J2&amp;csi=5774&amp;hl=t&amp;hv=t&amp;hnsd=f&amp;hns=t&amp;hgn=t&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true Russia's New Normal: The Cold War may be over, but that doesn't mean the threat from the Kremlin has entirely disappeared.] Newsweek; World Affairs. 17 March 2008. LexisNexis Database(. Retrieved 12 October 2011)Vol. 151 No 11. {{ISSN|0163-7053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than submit their works for [[peer review]], negationist historians rewrite history and use [[fallacy|logical fallacies]] to construct arguments that will obtain the desired results, a "revised history" that supports an agenda&amp;nbsp;– political, ideological, religious, etc.&lt;ref name="Evans-145"/&gt; In the practice of [[historiography]], the British historian [[Richard J. Evans]] describes the technical differences, between [[historical revisionism|professional historians]] and negationist historians:

{{quote|Reputable and professional historians do not suppress parts of quotations from documents that go against their own case, but take them into account, and, if necessary, amend their own case, accordingly. They do not present, as genuine, documents which they know to be forged, just because these forgeries happen to back up what they are saying. They do not invent ingenious, but implausible, and utterly unsupported reasons for distrusting genuine documents, because these documents run counter to their arguments; again, they amend their arguments, if this is the case, or, indeed, abandon them altogether. They do not consciously attribute their own conclusions to books and other sources, which, in fact, on closer inspection, actually say the opposite. They do not eagerly seek out the highest possible figures in a series of statistics, independently of their reliability, or otherwise, simply because they want, for whatever reason, to maximize the figure in question, but rather, they assess all the available figures, as impartially as possible, in order to arrive at a number that will withstand the critical scrutiny of others. They do not knowingly mistranslate sources in foreign languages in order to make them more serviceable to themselves. They do not willfully invent words, phrases, quotations, incidents and events, for which there is no historical evidence, in order to make their arguments more plausible.&lt;ref name="Evans-Pgrph-6-20"&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]]. David Irving, Hitler and Holocaust Denial: Electronic Edition, [http://www.hdot.org/en/trial/defense/evans/6.html 6. General Conclusion] Paragraphs 6.20,6.21&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Deception===
{{See also| Disinformation}}
Deception includes falsifying information, [[Obscurantism|obscuring the truth]], and lying in order to manipulate public opinion about the historical event discussed in the revised history. The negationist historian applies the techniques of deception to achieve either a political or an [[Ideology|ideological]] goal, or both. The field of history distinguishes among history books based upon credible, verifiable sources, and were [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] before publication; and deceptive history books, based upon incredible sources, and which were not submitted for peer review.&lt;ref&gt;Falsifier:
* Jon Silverman [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4449212.stm How 'Holocaust denier' fought and lost] on the [[BBC]] web-site 18 November 2005
* [[Malte Herwig]] "[http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/spiegel/0,1518,395810,00.html The Swastika Wielding Provocateur]" in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' 16 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction among types of history-book rests upon the research techniques used in writing a history. Verifiability, accuracy, and openness to criticism are central tenets of historical [[Scholarly method|scholarship]]. When these techniques are sidestepped, the presented historical information might be deliberately deceptive, a "revised history".

===Denial===
{{See also| Denialism| Conspiracy theory}}
Denial is defensively protecting information from being shared with other historians, and claiming that facts are untrue&amp;nbsp;– especially denial of the [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] perpetrated in the course of the [[World War II]] (1939–45) and the [[Holocaust]] (1933–45). The negationist historian protects the historical-revisionism project by [[blame shifting|shifting the blame]], censorship, distraction, and [[media manipulation]]; occasionally, denial by protection includes [[risk management]] for the physical security of revisionist sources.
{{Further information|Holocaust denial| Criticism of Holocaust denial }}

===Relativization and trivialization===
{{main article|Holocaust trivialization}}
Comparing certain historical atrocities to other crimes is the practice of relativization, interpretation by moral judgements, in order to alter public perception of the first historical atrocity. Although such comparisons can often occur in negationist history, their pronouncement is not usually part of revisionist intentions upon the historical facts, but an opinion of [[moral judgement]].
* The Holocaust and [[Nazism]]: The historian [[Deborah Lipstadt]] said that the concept of "comparable Allied wrongs", such as the [[expulsion of Germans after World War II]] from [[Lebensraum|Nazi-colonised lands]] and the formal [[Allied war crimes during World War II|Allied war crimes]], is at the center of, and is a continually repeated theme of, contemporary [[Holocaust denial]], that such relativization presents "immoral equivalencies".&lt;ref&gt;Barry Loberfeld, [http://abcdunlimited.com/ideas/denying.html "Denying the Other Holocausts"]: Professor Lipstadt's Own Assault on Truth and Memory, [[Liberty (1987)|Liberty]], May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
{{Denial of mass killings}}

===Book burning===

Repositories of literature have been targeted throughout history (e.g., the [[Destruction of the Library of Alexandria|Library of Alexandria]]), burning of the liturgical and historical books of the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church|St. Thomas Christians]] by the [[Patriarch of the East Indies|archbishop of Goa]] [[Aleixo de Menezes]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Gouvea, Jornada (Coimbra, 1606);Geddes,"History of the Malabar Church", London, 1694&lt;/ref&gt; including recently, such as the [[Burning of Jaffna library]] and the destruction of Iraqi libraries by ISIS during the [[fall of Mosul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/26/isis-destroys-thousands-books-libraries|last=Fadhil|first=Muna|title=Isis destroys thousands of books and manuscripts in Mosul libraries |date=26 February 2015|accessdate=17 July 2015|publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chinese book burning====
The ''[[Burning of books and burying of scholars]]'' ({{zh|t=焚書坑儒|s=焚书坑儒|p=fénshū kēngrú|l=burning of books and burying (alive) of (Confucian) scholars|first=t}}), or "Fires of Qin", refers to the burning of writings and slaughter of scholars during the [[Qin Dynasty]] of [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], between the period of 213 and 210 BC. "Books" at this point refers to writings on [[Bamboo and wooden slips|bamboo strips]], which were then bound together. This contributed to the loss to history of many philosophical theories of proper government (known as "the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]]"). The official philosophy of government ("[[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]]") survived.

====Nazi book burning====
{{main article|Nazi book burnings}}
 [[File:1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG|thumb|right|300px|A Nazi-sponsored book burning meant to negate the value of Germany's literary history (10 May 1933, Berlin).]]
In the mid–1930s, the [[Nazi book burnings]] were part of a campaign of [[anti-intellectualism]] conducted throughout [[Germany]] and [[Austria]] by the ''[[Deutsche Studentenschaft]]'' (German Student Association) of the [[Third Reich]] (1933–45). The burning of books was a public ceremony in which the works of authors whose politics were [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]], [[Anarchism|anarchist]], [[Socialism|Socialist]], [[Pacifism|pacifist]], and [[Communism|Communist]] were fuel for bonfires. Given the official [[antisemitism]] of the Reich, the works of [[Jews|Jewish]] writers were specifically identified for burning; thus did Nazi Germany rid themselves of writers deemed subversive of the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist]] ideology.

In Poland, the ''Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen'' ("[[Special Prosecution Book-Poland]]") was the book of political proscription for the killing of socially important Poles who might lead resistance against the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)|Nazi Occupation of Poland]] (1939–45). Compiled before the war began in 1939, the book contained lists that identified more than 61,000 members of the Polish elites&amp;nbsp;– political and social [[activist]]s, the [[intelligentsia]], [[Academia|scholars]], actors, former [[military officer]]s&amp;nbsp;– as enemies of the state dangerous to the Third Reich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacwashmetrodiv.org/events/holoc04/moor-jankowski.htm|title=Poland's Holocaust|publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Germany-occupied France]], anti-fascist exiles made a "Library of Burned Books" of every book that [[Adolf Hitler]] had ordered destroyed in France. It listed copies of titles that had been burned. The book burnings in France were an idea that the [[Révolution nationale|French fascists]], of the collaborating [[Vichy government]] (1940–44), borrowed from the Nazis, to cleanse French culture of Jewish intellectualism and the foreign politics of [[pacifism]], decadent literature, and [[degenerate art]], as the Nazis had cleansed German culture. In the event, after the [[Final Solution]] had concluded, for the post-war world, the Nazis had planned to establish a museum of Judaism that would have featured selected books of Jewish culture, preserved ''in memoriam'' of the extinct Jews of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyons|first=Martyn|title=Books:A Living History|year=2011|publisher=J.Paul Getty Museum|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1-60606-083-4|pages=200–01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical negationism of [[American Civil War]] revisionists and [[Neo-Confederate]]s claims that the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] (1861–65) were the defenders rather than the instigators of the war, and that the Confederacy's motivation for secession from the [[United States]] was the maintenance of the southern states' rights and limited government, rather than the preservation and expansion of the [[chattel slavery]] of African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Confronting Civil War Revisionism: Why the South Went to War | url=http://www.wallbuilders.com/libissuesarticles.asp?id=92 | author=David Barton |work=Wall Builders | date=December 2008 | accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Neoconfederate civil war revisionism: Those who commemorate the South's fallen heroes are entitled to do so, but not to deny that slavery was the war's prime cause| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/dec/26/american-civil-war-usa | author=Barrett Brown |work=TheGuardian.com | date=27 December 2010 | accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Howard Swint: Confederate revisionism warps U.S. history|url=http://www.charlestondailymail.com/Opinion/Commentary/201106140917 | work=Charleston Daily Mail | date=June 15, 2011 | accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Neo-Confederate revisionism of the U.S. Civil War, the historian [[Brooks D. Simpson]] said that:

{{quote|This is an active attempt to reshape historical memory, an effort by white Southerners to find historical justifications for present-day actions. The neo–Confederate movement's ideologues have grasped that if they control how people remember the past, they'll control how people approach the present and the future. Ultimately, this is a very conscious war for memory and heritage.

In the early 20th century, [[Mildred Rutherford]], the historian general of the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] (UDC), led the attack against [[American history]] textbooks that did not present the ''[[Lost Cause of the Confederacy]]'' (ca. 1900) version of the history of the U.S. Civil War. To that pedagogical end, Rutherford assembled a "massive collection" of documents that included "essay contests on the glory of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and personal tributes to faithful slaves".&lt;ref&gt;Blight, David W. Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory. (2001) p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; About the historical negationism of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the historian [[David Blight]] said:

{{quote|All UDC members and leaders were not as virulently [[racism|racist]] as Rutherford, but all, in the name of a reconciled nation, participated in an enterprise that deeply influenced the [[white supremacist]] vision of Civil War memory.&lt;ref&gt;Blight, David W.

====Serbian war crimes in the Yugoslav wars====
{{Main article|Serbia in the Yugoslav Wars}}
There have been a number of scholars and political activists who have publicly disagreed with mainstream views of [[Serbia in the Yugoslav Wars#War crimes|Serbian war crimes in the Yugoslav wars]] of 1991–1999. Among the points of contention are whether the victims of massacres such as the [[Račak massacre]] and [[Srebrenica massacre]] were unarmed civilians or armed resistance fighters, whether death and rape tolls were inflated, and whether prison camps such as [[Sremska Mitrovica camp]] were sites of mass war crimes.

These scholars are labeled "revisionists" by their opponents. For example, [[Diana Johnstone]]'s controversial book, ''Fools' Crusade: Yugoslavia, Nato, and Western Delusions'', questions whether genocidal killings occurred in Srebrenica. The book was rejected by publishers in Sweden&lt;ref name="MAH"&gt;Marko Attila Hoare [http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=6494 "Chomsky's Genocidal Denial"] {{Webarchive|url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171019225839/http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=6494 |date=19 October 2017 }}, FrontPage magazine, 23 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; prompting an open letter in 2003 defending Johnstone's book (and her right to publish) which was signed by, among others, [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Arundhati Roy]], [[Tariq Ali]] and [[John Pilger]]: "We regard Diana Johnstone's ''Fools' Crusade'' as an outstanding work, dissenting from the mainstream view but doing so by an appeal to fact and reason, in a great tradition."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hagglundsforlag.se/forfattaredok/johnstone/ChomskyDararnas.htm "To whom it may concern"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208074819/http://www.hagglundsforlag.se/forfattaredok/Johnstone/ChomskyDararnas.htm |date=8 February 2012 }}, hagglundsforlag (Sweden)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nnn.se/n-model/foreign/ordfront.pdf "Attack of the Zarembites",] ''Ordfront'' (Sweden), April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Richard Caplan of Reading and Oxford University reviewed the work in '' [[International Affairs (journal)|International Affairs]]'', where he described the work as "a revisionist and highly contentious account of western policy and the dissolution of Yugoslavia".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Caplan [http://www.politicalreviewnet.com/polrev/reviews/INTA/R_0020_5850_624_17222.asp "Fool's crusade: Yugoslavia, NATO and western delusions by Diana Johnstone Pluto Press, London",] ''International Affairs'', 79: 2, pp. 413–74, as reproduced on Political Reviewnet, 18 June 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Marko Attila Hoare]] called it "an extremely poor book, one that is little more than a polemic in defence of the Serb-nationalist record during the wars of the 1990s&amp;nbsp;– and an ill-informed one at that".&lt;ref name="MAH"/&gt;

{{Main article|Armenian Genocide denial}}
Turkish laws such as [[Article 301 (Turkish Penal Code)|Article 301]], that state "a person who publicly insults Turkishness, or the Republic or [the] Turkish Grand National Assembly of Turkey, shall be punishable by imprisonment", were used to criminally charge the writer [[Orhan Pamuk]] with disrespecting Turkey, for saying that "Thirty thousand Kurds, and a million [[Armenians]], were killed in these lands, and nobody, but me, dares to talk about it".&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Rainsford ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4527318.stm Author's trial set to test Turkey]'' [[BBC]] 14 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy occurred as Turkey was first vying for membership in the [[European Union]] (EU) where the suppression of dissenters is looked down upon.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;Madeleine Brand speaks with Hugh Pope ''[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5171842 Charges Against Turkish Writer Pamuk Dropped]'' [[National Public Radio|NPR]] 25 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 301 originally was part of penal-law reforms meant to modernise Turkey to EU standards, as part of negotiating Turkey's membership to the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/Article?tcmuri=tcm:29-140266-16&amp;type=News "Turkey's new penal code touches raw nerves"] EurActiv 2 June 2005, updated 14 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the charges were dropped due to pressure from the European Union and United States on the Turkish government.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

The case against the fifth journalist, [[Murat Belge]], proceeded until 8 June 2006, when he was also acquitted.

During the existence of the [[Russian SFSR]] (1917–1991) and the [[Soviet Union]] (1922–1991), the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) attempted to ideologically and politically control the writing of both academic and popular history. These attempts were most successful in 1934–52 period. According to Mehnert, the Soviets attempt to control academic [[historiography]] (the writing of history by academic historians) to promote ideological and ethno-racial [[imperialism]] by Russians.&lt;ref name="Mehnert1952Marx"/&gt;{{better source|This is a dated source; and may be Cold war propaganda|date=April 2016}} During the 1928–56 period, modern and contemporary history was generally composed according to the wishes of the CPSU, not the requirements of accepted historiographic method.&lt;ref name="Mehnert1952Marx"/&gt;

During and after the rule of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] (1956–64), Soviet historiographic practice is more complicated. Although not entirely corrupted, Soviet historiography was characterized by complex competition between Stalinist and anti-Stalinist Marxist historians.&lt;ref name="Markwick"/&gt; To avoid the professional hazard of politicized history, some historians chose pre-modern, medieval history or classical history, where ideological demands were relatively relaxed and conversation with other historians in the field could be fostered;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Historian (journal)]] ''[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6563.1957.tb01984.x/full Encounters with Soviet Historians]'' in [[The Historian (journal)]] November 1957. Vol 20. No 1. pp. 80–95&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless, despite the potential danger of proscribed ideology corrupting historians' work, not all of Soviet historiography was corrupt.&lt;ref name="Markwick"/&gt;

Control over party history and the legal status of individual ex-party members played a large role in dictating the ideological diversity and thus the faction in power within the CPSU. The history of the Communist Party was revised to delete references to leaders purged from the party, especially during the rule of [[Joseph Stalin]] (1922–53).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;An example of changing visual history is the Party motivated practice of [[Censorship of images in the Soviet Union|altering photographs]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Historiography of the Cold War]], a controversy over negationist historical revisionism exists, where numerous revisionist scholars in the West have been accused of [[Whitewash (censorship)|whitewashing]] the crimes of [[Stalinism]], overlooking the [[Katyn massacre]] in Poland and disregarding the validity of the [[Venona project|Venona messages]] with regards to [[Soviet espionage in the US|Soviet espionage in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Earl Haynes]] and [[Harvey Klehr]].

For instance in the revised texts the word "Armenian" is either simply removed or is replaced by the word "Albanian"; there are many other examples of such falsifications, all of which have the purpose of creating an impression that historically Armenians were not present in this territory.

Willem M. Floor and Hasan Javadi in the English edition of "The Heavenly Rose-Garden: A History of Shirvan &amp; Daghestan" by [[Abbasgulu Bakikhanov|Bakikhanov]] specifically point out to the instances of distortions and falsifications made by [[Buniatov]] in his Russian translation of this book.&lt;ref name="FloorJavadi" /&gt; According to Bournoutian and Hewsen these distortions are widespread in these works; they thus advise the readers in general to avoid the books produced in Azerbaijan in Soviet and post-Soviet times if these books do not contain the facsimile copy of original sources.&lt;ref name="Hewsen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PrimarySources" /&gt; Shnirelman thinks that this practice is being realized in Azerbaijan according to state order.&lt;ref name="ShnirelmanTheValue" /&gt;

The political context within which such myths are articulated is critical, and this context continually changes: given the events of the last nine years, assertion that today's Azerbaijan was the original homeland of Turkic-speaking peoples is charged with political significance"&lt;/ref&gt;

In their turn Azerbaijani historians claim that the historians of other countries falsify the true history of Azerbaijan. As an example of falsifications Azerbaijani historians consider historical references about the presence of Armenians on the territory of [[Karabakh]]

===North Korea===
;The Korean War
Since the start of the [[Korean War]] (1950–53), the government of [[North Korea]] has consistently denied that the Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea (DPRK) launched the attack with which began the war for the Communist unification of Korea. The historiography of the DPRK maintains that the war was provoked by [[South Korea]], at the instigation of the United States:

{{quote|On June 17, Juche 39 [1950] the then U.S. President [Harry S.] Truman sent [John Foster] Dulles as his special envoy to South Korea to examine the anti-North war scenario and give an order to start the attack. On June 18, Dulles inspected the 38th parallel and the war preparations of the ‘ROK Army’ units. That day he told [[Syngman Rhee]] to start the attack on North Korea with the counter-propaganda that North Korea first ‘invaded’ the south.&lt;ref&gt;"U.S. Order to Start Korean War", Korean Central News Agency, 12 June 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Further North Korean pronouncements included the claim that the U.S. needed the peninsula of Korea as "a bridgehead, for invading the Asian continent, and as a strategic base, from which to fight against national-liberation movements and socialism, and, ultimately, to attain world supremacy."&lt;ref&gt;Ho Jong Ho, Kang Sok Hui, and Pak Thae Ho, ''US Imperialists Started the Korean War'' (Pyongyang: Foreign Languages Publishing House, 1993), p. 11. Accessible at http://www.uk-songun.com/index.php?p=1_110_US-IMPERIALISTS-STARTED-THE-KOREAN-WAR .&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the DPRK denied the war crimes committed by the North Korean army in the course of the war; nonetheless, in the 1951-52 period, the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK) privately admitted to the "excesses" of their earlier campaign against North Korean citizens who had collaborated with the enemy&amp;nbsp;– either actually or allegedly&amp;nbsp;– during the US–South Korean occupation of North Korea. Later, the WPK blamed every war-time atrocity upon the U.S. military, e.g. the [[Sinchon Massacre]] (17 October – 7 December 1950) occurred during the retreat of the DPRK government from Hwanghae Province, in the south-west of North Korea.

The campaign against "[[Collaborationism|collaborators]]" was attributed to political and ideological manipulations by the U.S. About which the high-rank leader [[Pak Chang-ok]] said that the American enemy had "started to use a new method, namely, it donned a [[leftist]] garb, which considerably influenced the inexperienced cadres of the Party and government organs."&lt;ref&gt;Balázs Szalontai.

The [[Korean Central News Agency]] dismissed the historical record of Soviet documents as "sheer forgery".&lt;ref&gt;Korean Central News Agency, 19 January 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Holocaust denial|Criticism of Holocaust denial}}
Holocaust deniers usually reject the term ''Holocaust denier'' as an inaccurate description of their historical point of view, instead, preferring, the term ''Holocaust revisionist'';&lt;ref&gt;"Holocaust deniers often refer to themselves as 'revisionists', in an attempt to claim legitimacy for their activities".

* "This is the phenomenon of what has come to be known as 'revisionism', 'negationism', or 'Holocaust denial,' whose main characteristic is either an outright rejection of the very veracity of the Nazi genocide of the Jews, or at least a concerted attempt to minimize both its scale and importance&amp;nbsp;... It is just as crucial, however, to distinguish between the wholly objectionable politics of denial and the fully legitimate scholarly revision of previously accepted conventional interpretations of any historical event, including the Holocaust."

* "The two leading critical exposés of Holocaust denial in the United States were written by historians [[Deborah Lipstadt]] (1993) and [[Michael Shermer]] and Alex Grobman (2000). These scholars make a distinction between historical revisionism and denial. Revisionism, in their view, entails a refinement of existing knowledge about a historical event, not a denial of the event itself, that comes through the examination of new empirical evidence or a reexamination or reinterpretation of existing evidence. Legitimate historical revisionism acknowledges a "certain body of irrefutable evidence" or a "convergence of evidence" that suggest that an event – like the black plague, American slavery, or the Holocaust – did in fact occur (Lipstadt 1993:21; Shermer &amp; Grobman 200:34). Denial, on the other hand, rejects the entire foundation of historical evidence&amp;nbsp;..." Ronald J. Berger.

It is not intended as a polemic, nor does it attempt to ascribe motives. Rather, it seeks to explain the fundamental error in the "revisionist" approach, as well as why that approach of necessity leaves no other choice. It concludes that "revisionism" is a misnomer because the facts do not accord with the position it puts forward and, more importantly, its methodology reverses the appropriate approach to historical investigation&amp;nbsp;..."Revisionism" is obliged to deviate from the standard methodology of historical pursuit because it seeks to mold facts to fit a preconceived result, it denies events that have been objectively and empirically proved to have occurred, and because it works backward from the conclusion to the facts, thus necessitating the distortion and manipulation of those facts where they differ from the preordained conclusion (which they almost always do). In short, "revisionism" denies something that demonstrably happened, through methodological dishonesty." McFee, Gordon.

* "Crucial to understanding and combating Holocaust denial is a clear distinction between denial and revisionism. One of the more insidious and dangerous aspects of contemporary Holocaust denial, a la Arthur Butz, Bradley Smith and Greg Raven, is the fact that they attempt to present their work as reputable scholarship under the guise of 'historical revisionism.' The term 'revisionist' permeates their publications as descriptive of their motives, orientation and methodology. In fact, Holocaust denial is in no sense 'revisionism,' it is denial&amp;nbsp;... Contemporary Holocaust deniers are not revisionists – not even neo-revisionists. They are ''Deniers''. Their motivations stem from their neo-nazi political goals and their rampant antisemitism."

* "Holocaust denial can be a particularly insidious form of antisemitism precisely because it often tries to disguise itself as something quite different: as genuine scholarly debate (in the pages, for example, of the innocuous-sounding Journal for Historical Review). Holocaust deniers often refer to themselves as 'revisionists', in an attempt to claim legitimacy for their activities. There are, of course, a great many scholars engaged in historical debates about the Holocaust whose work should not be confused with the output of the Holocaust deniers. Debate continues about such subjects as, for example, the extent and nature of ordinary Germans' involvement in and knowledge of the policy of genocide, and the timing of orders given for the extermination of the Jews. However, the valid endeavour of historical revisionism, which involves the re-interpretation of historical knowledge in the light of newly emerging evidence, is a very different task from that of claiming that the essential facts of the Holocaust, and the evidence for those facts, are fabrications."

* "In 1969, after David Irving's support for Rolf Hochhuth, the German playwright who accused Winston Churchill of murdering the Polish wartime leader General Sikorski, The Daily Telegraph issued a memo to all its correspondents. 'It is incorrect,' it said, 'to describe David Irving as a historian. In future we should describe him as an author.'" Ingram, Richard.

* "It may seem an absurd semantic dispute to deny the appellation of 'historian' to someone who has written two dozen books or more about historical subjects. But if we mean by historian someone who is concerned to discover the truth about the past, and to give as accurate a representation of it as possible, then Irving is not a historian. Those in the know, indeed, are accustomed to avoid the term altogether when referring to him and use some circumlocution such as 'historical writer' instead. Irving is essentially an ideologue who uses history for his own political purposes; he is not primarily concerned with discovering and interpreting what happened in the past, he is concerned merely to give a selective and tendentious account of it in order to further his own ideological ends in the present. The true historian's primary concern, however, is with the past. That is why, in the end, Irving is not a historian."

The [[Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989]] were a series of pro-democracy demonstrations that were put down violently on June 4, 1989, by the Chinese government via the [[People's Liberation Army]], resulting in estimated casualty of over 10,000 deaths and 40,000 injured, obtained via later declassified documents.&lt;ref&gt;https://hk.news.appledaily.com/local/daily/article/20140605/18744916}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nextplus.nextmedia.com/news/spot/20140604/46139&lt;/ref&gt;, whereas the government claimed official estimates of 0 - 200 civilian deaths. Western media referred to this crackdown as the "[[Tiananmen Square Massacre]]", and in Chinese media it was called the "June Fourth Incident".

However, the [[Chinese Communist Party]] decided to downplay and later deny the occurrence of the protests and massacre, therefore, soon afterwards, news media and internet coverage of the events were suppressed and the search terms in Chinese for "June Fourth protests", "June Fourth incident", "Tiananmen Square protests", "Tiananmen Square Massacre", and similar terms were manipulated through [[Great Firewall of China|censorship]] such that no results come up or if any, only results that have been cleaned up and relate to Tiananmen Square or June Fourth in general would be shown.  On [[Baidu]], China's largest internet search engine for the [[Chinese language]] and on [[Baidu Baike]], Baidu's version of Wikipedia, for the entry "June 4", which lists all significant events on this date in history throughout the world, for the year 1989, there's completely no mention of this incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=六月四日|url=https://baike.baidu.com/item/6%E6%9C%884%E6%97%A5/8691062?fromtitle=%E5%85%AD%E6%9C%88%E5%9B%9B%E6%97%A5&amp;fromid=11272386&amp;fr=aladdin#1|website=baidu.com|date=7 June 2018|access-date=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{or|date=September 2018}}

In the 1990s following a massive western media coverage of the [[Yugoslav civil war]], there was a rise of the publications considering the matter on historical revisionism of [[former Yugoslavia]]. One of the most prominent authors on the field of historical revisionism in the 1990s considering the newly emerged republics is [[Noel Malcolm]] and his works ''Bosnia: A Short History (1994)'' and ''Kosovo: A Short History (1998)'', that have seen a robust debate among historians following their release; following the release of the latter, the merits of the book were the subject of an extended debate in ''Foreign Affairs''. Critics said that the book was "marred by his sympathies for its ethnic Albanian separatists, anti-Serbian bias, and illusions about the Balkans".{{sfn|Djilas|1998}} In late 1999, Thomas Emmert of the history faculty of [[Gustavus Adolphus College]] in [[Minnesota]] reviewed the book in ''Journal of Southern Europe and the Balkans Online'' and while praising aspects of the book also asserted that it was "shaped by the author's overriding determination to challenge Serbian myths", that Malcolm was "partisan", and also complained that the book made a "transparent attempt to prove that the main Serbian myths are false".{{sfn|Emmert|1999}} In 2006, a study by Frederick Anscombe looked at issues surrounding scholarship on Kosovo such as Noel Malcolm's work ''Kosovo: A Short History''.&lt;ref name="Anscombe770"/&gt; Anscombe noted that Malcolm offered a "a detailed critique of the competing versions of Kosovo's history" and that his work marked a "remarkable reversal" of previous acceptance by Western historians of the "Serbian account" regarding the migration of the Serbs (1690) from Kosovo.&lt;ref name="Anscombe770"&gt;{{harvnb|Anscombe|2006|p=770}}. "Noel Malcolm, who offers a detailed critique of the competing versions of Kosovo's history... Here is a remarkable reversal, as Malcolm, like other Western historians, had previously accepted the Serbian account."&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm has been criticized for being "anti-Serbian" and selective like the Serbs with the sources, while other more restrained critics note that "his arguments are unconvincing".&lt;ref name="Anscombe770771"/&gt; Anscombe noted that Malcolm, like Serbian and Yugoslav historians who have ignored his conclusions sideline and are unwilling to consider indigenous evidence such as that from the Ottoman archive when composing national history.&lt;ref name="Anscombe770771"&gt;{{harvnb|Anscombe|2006|pp=770–71}}. "Malcolm is criticized for being anti-Serbian, and for using his sources as selectively as the Serbs, though the more restrained of his critics only suggest that his arguments are unconvincing. Most of the documents he relies on were written by enemies of the Ottoman Empire, or by officials with limited experience of the Ottoman Balkans... Malcolm, like the historians of Serbia and Yugoslavia who ignore his findings, overlooks the most valuable indigenous evidence. Unwillingness to consider Ottoman evidence when constructing national history is exemplified by the Serbian historians..."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
[[File:Revisionists Yasukuni 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A member of the [[Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform]] erects a banner reading "[Give] the Children Correct History Textbooks".]]
The [[Japanese history textbook controversies|history textbook controversy]] centers upon the secondary school history textbook ''Atarashii Rekishi Kyōkasho'' ("New History Textbook") said to [[whitewash (censorship)|minimise]] the nature of Japanese militarism in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–95), in annexing Korea in 1910, in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–45), and in the Pacific Theater of [[World War II]] (1941–45). The conservative [[Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform]] commissioned the ''Atarashii Rekishi Kyōkasho'' textbook with the purpose of traditional national and international view of that Japanese historical period. The Ministry of Education vets all history textbooks, and those that do not mention Japanese war crimes and atrocities are not vetted;{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} however, the ''Atarashii Rekishi Kyōkasho'' de-emphasises aggressive Japanese Imperial wartime behaviour and the matter of Chinese and Korean [[comfort women]]. It has even been denied that the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanking massacre]] (a series of violences and rapes carried on by the Japanese army against Chinese civilians during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]) ever took place (see [[Nanking Massacre denial|Nanking massacre denial]]).&lt;ref name=Hoshiyama&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoshiyama |first=Takashi |title=The Split Personality of the Nanking Massacre |url=http://www.iips.org/bp330e.pdf |date=November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101104617/http://www.iips.org/bp330e.pdf |archivedate=1 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the [[Ministry of Education]] attempted to revise textbooks regarding the [[Battle of Okinawa]], lessening the involvement of the Japanese military in Okinawan civilian mass suicides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070623a1.html Okinawa slams history text rewrite], ''Japan Times'', 23 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gheddo |first=Piero |url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Okinawa-against-Tokyo%E2%80%99s-attempts-to-rewrite-history-9666.html |title=Okinawa against Tokyo's attempts to rewrite history |publisher=Asianews.it |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pakistan====
{{Further information|Pakistani textbooks controversy}}
Allegations of historical revisionism have been made regarding Pakistani textbooks in that they are laced with [[Indophobic]] and [[Islamist]] bias. Pakistan's use of officially published textbooks has been criticized for using schools to more subtly foster religious extremism, whitewashing [[Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent]] and promoting "expansive pan-Islamic imaginings" that "detect the beginnings of Pakistan in the birth of Islam on the Arabian peninsula".&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.dawn.com/archives/30854 Curriculum of hatred], [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]], 20 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2001, the Pakistani government has stated that curriculum reforms have been underway by the [[Ministry of Education (Pakistan)|Ministry of Education]].&lt;ref name="Jamil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itacec.org/document/nep09/NCERT%20Pakistan%20paper%20BRJ.pdf|title=Curriculum Reforms in Pakistan – A Glass Half Full or Half Empty?|last=Jamil|first=Baela Raza|publisher=Idara-e-Taleem-o-Aagahi|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jalal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tufts.edu/~ajalal01/Articles/conjuring.pdf|title=Conjuring Pakistan: History as Official Imagining|last=Jalal|first=Ayesha|work=International Journal of Middle East Studies, 27, (1995), 73–89|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/may/18/pakistan-textbooks-religious-extremism The threat of Pakistan's revisionist texts], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Korea====
12 October 2015, South Korea's government has announced controversial plans to control the history textbooks used in secondary schools despite oppositional concerns of people and academics that the decision is made to glorify the history of those who served the Imperial Japanese government ([[Chinilpa]]). Section and the authoritarian dictatorships in South Korea during 1960s–1980s.The Ministry of Education announced that it would put the secondary-school history textbook under state control; "This was an inevitable choice in order to straighten out historical errors and end the social dispute caused by ideological bias in the textbooks," Hwang Woo-yea, education minister said on 12 October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20151012000678|title=Ministry unveils plan for history textbook publication system|first=The Korea|last=Herald|date=12 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the government's plan, the current history textbooks of South Korea will be replaced by a single textbook written by a panel of government-appointed historians and the new series of publications would be issued under the title ''The Correct Textbook of History'' and are to be issued to the public and private primary and secondary schools in 2017 onwards.

The move has sparked fierce criticism from academics who argue the system can be used to distort the history and glorify the history of those who served the Imperial Japanese government ([[Chinilpa]]) and of the authoritarian dictatorships. Moreover, 466 organisations including Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union formed History Act Network in solidarity and have staged protests: "The government's decision allows the state too much control and power and, therefore, it is against political neutrality that is certainly the fundamental principle of education." Many South Korean historians condemned [[Kyohaksa]] for their text glorifying those who served the Imperial Japanese government (Chinilpa) and the authoritarian dictatorship with a far-right political perspective. On the other hand, New Right supporters welcomed the textbook saying that ‘the new textbook finally describes historical truths contrary to the history textbooks published by left-wing publishers,’ and the textbook issue became intensified as a case of ideological conflict.

In fact, there once was a time in Korean history that the history textbook was put under state control. It was during the authoritarian regime under Park Chung-hee (1963-1979), who is a father of Park Geun-hye, former President of South Korea, and was used as a means to keep the Yushin Regime (also known as Yushin Dictatorship). However, there had been continuous criticisms about the system especially from the 1980s when Korea experienced a dramatic democratic development. In 2003, liberalisation of textbook began when the textbooks on Korean modern and contemporary history were published though the Textbook Screening System, which allows textbooks to be published not by a single government body but by many different companies, for the first time.

====Turkey====
[[Education in Turkey]] is centralised: its policy, administration and content are each determined by the Turkish government. Textbooks taught in schools are either prepared directly by the [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Ministry of National Education (MEB)]] or must be approved by its Instruction and Education Board. In practice, this means that the Turkish government is directly responsible for what textbooks are taught in schools across Turkey.&lt;ref name=armenianweekly&gt;[http://armenianweekly.com/2014/12/04/textbooks/ Akcam: Textbooks and the Armenian Genocide in Turkey: Heading Towards 2015], ''[[Armenian Weekly]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Taner Akçam]], writing for the [[Armenian Weekly]], discussed 2014-15 Turkish elementary and middle school textbooks that the MEB had made available on the internet. He found that Turkish history textbooks are filled with the message that Armenians are people "who are incited by foreigners, who aim to break apart the state and the country, and who murdered Turks and Muslims." The Armenian Genocide is referred to as the "Armenian matter", and is described as a lie perpetrated in order to further the perceived hidden agenda of Armenians. Recognition of the Armenian Genocide is defined as the "biggest threat to Turkish national security".&lt;ref name=armenianweekly/&gt;

Akçam summarized one textbook that claims the Armenians had sided with the Russians during the war. The 1909 [[Adana massacre]], in which as many as 20,000–30,000 Armenians were massacred, is identified as "The Rebellion of Armenians of Adana". According to the book, the Armenian [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party|Hnchak]] and [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnak]] organizations instituted rebellions in many parts of [[Anatolia]], and "didn’t hesitate to kill Armenians who would not join them," issuing instructions that "if you want to survive you have to kill your neighbor first." Claims highlighted by Akçam:&lt;ref name=armenianweekly/&gt; &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;[The Armenians murdered] many people living in villages, even children, by attacking Turkish villages, which had become defenseless because all the Turkish men were fighting on the war fronts. ... They stabbed the Ottoman forces in the back. They created obstacles for the operations of the Ottoman units by cutting off their supply routes and destroying bridges and roads. ... They spied for Russia and by rebelling in the cities where they were located, they eased the way for the Russian invasion. ... Since the Armenians who engaged in massacres in collaboration with the Russians created a dangerous situation, this law required the migration of [Armenian people] from the towns they were living in to Syria, a safe Ottoman territory. ... Despite being in the midst of war, the Ottoman state took precautions and measures when it came to the Armenians who were migrating. Their tax payments were postponed, they were permitted to take any personal property they wished, government officials were assigned to ensure that they were protected from attacks during the journey and that their needs were met, police stations were established to ensure that their lives and properties were secure.&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

Similar revisionist claims found in other textbooks by Akçam included that Armenian "back-stabbing" was the reason the Ottomans lost the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78]] (similar to the post-War German [[stab-in-the-back myth]]), that the [[Hamidian massacres]] never happened, that the Armenians were armed by the Russians during late [[World War I]] to fight the Ottomans (in reality they had already been nearly annihilated from the area by this point), that Armenians killed 600,000 Turks during said war, that the deportation were to save Armenians from other violent Armenian gangs, and that Armenians who were deported were later able to return to Turkey unscathed and reclaim their properties.&lt;ref name=armenianweekly/&gt;

As of 2015, Turkish textbooks still describe the Armenians as "traitors", call the Armenian Genocide a lie and say that the Ottoman Turks "took necessary measures to counter Armenian separatism."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/world/europe/turkeys-century-of-denial-about-an-armenian-genocide.html A Century After Armenian Genocide, Turkey's Denial Only Deepens], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Armenians are also characterised as "dishonorable and treacherous," and students are taught that Armenians were forcibly relocated to protect Turkish citizens from attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/04/23/turkey-armenia-genocide-massacre-anniversary/26261059/ Turkey, Armenians battle over genocide 100 years later], ''[[USA Today]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===French law recognising colonialism's positive value===
{{Main article|French law on colonialism}}
On 23 February 2005, the [[Union for a Popular Movement|Union for a Popular Movement (UMP)]] conservative majority at the [[French National Assembly]] voted a law compelling history textbooks and teachers to "acknowledge and recognize in particular the positive role of the French presence abroad, especially in North Africa".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000444898&amp;fastPos=2&amp;fastReqId=1461448112&amp;categorieLien=id&amp;oldAction=rechTexte]&lt;/ref&gt; Criticized by historians and teachers, among them [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]], who refused to recognise the French Parliament's right to influence the way history is written (despite the French [[Holocaust denial]] laws, see ''[[Loi Gayssot]]''). That law was also challenged by left-wing parties and the former [[French colonial empires|French colonies]]; critics argued that the law was tantamount to refusing to acknowledge the racism inherent to French [[colonialism]], and that the law proper is a form of historical revisionism.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In retaliation against the law, Algerian president [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] refused to sign a prepared "friendly treaty" with France. On 26 June 2005, Bouteflika declared that the law "approached mental blindness, negationism and revisionism".

In the Philippines, the biggest examples of Historical negationism are linked to the Marcos family dynasty, usually [[Imelda Marcos]], [[Bongbong Marcos]], and [[Imee Marcos]] specifically.&lt;ref&gt;http://cmfr-phil.org/media-ethics-responsibility/journalism-review/edsa-people-power-inadequate-challenge-to-marcos-revisionism/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://news.mb.com.ph/2018/09/07/up-faculty-vows-to-fight-historical-revisionism/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.esquiremag.ph/politics/marcos-propaganda-a1576-20160923-lfrm2&lt;/ref&gt;  They have been accused of denying or trivializing the human rights violations during martial law and the plunder of the Philippines' coffers while [[Ferdinand Marcos]] was president.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/204000/asa350191977en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rappler.com/nation/103772-bongbong-marcos-regime-no-apologies&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ramifications and judicature==
Some countries have criminalised historical revisionism of historic events such as the [[Holocaust]]. The [[Council of Europe]] defines it as the "denial, gross minimisation, approval or justification of [[genocide]] or [[crimes against humanity]]" (article 6, ''Additional Protocol to the Convention on cybercrime'').

===International law===
{{main article|Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime}}
Some council-member states proposed an additional protocol to the [[Council of Europe]] [[Cybercrime Convention]], addressing materials and "acts of racist or xenophobic nature committed through computer networks"; it was negotiated from late 2001 to early 2002, and, on 7 November 2002, the [[Council of Europe Committee of Ministers]] adopted the protocol's final text&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/COEFAQs.htm#topicE Frequently asked questions and answers Council of Europe Convention on cybercrime] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209153034/http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/COEFAQs.htm |date=9 February 2006 }} by the US [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]&lt;/ref&gt; titled ''Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cyber-crime, Concerning the Criminalisation of Acts of a Racist and Xenophobic Nature Committed through Computer Systems'', ("Protocol").&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=189&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=17/02/2006&amp;CL=ENG Protocol to the Convention on cybercrime, concerning the criminalisation of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems] on the [[Council of Europe]] web site&lt;/ref&gt; It opened on 28 January 2003, and became current on 1 March 2006; as of 30 November 2011, 20 States have signed and ratified the Protocol, and 15 others have signed, but not yet ratified it (including Canada and South Africa).&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=189&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=30/11/2011&amp;CL=ENG APCoc Treaty open for signature by the States that signed the Treaty ETS 185.] on the [[Council of Europe]] web site&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protocol requires participant States to criminalise the dissemination of racist and xenophobic material, and of racist and xenophobic threats and insults through computer networks, such as the Internet.&lt;ref name="www.usdoj.gov COEFAQs"&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/COEFAQs.htm#topicE Frequently asked questions and answers Council of Europe Convention on cyber-crime] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209153034/http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/COEFAQs.htm |date=9 February 2006 }} by the United States Department of Justice&lt;/ref&gt; Article 6, Section 1 of the Protocol specifically covers [[Holocaust Denial]], and other genocides recognised as such by international courts, established since 1945, by relevant international legal instruments. Section 2 of Article 6 allows a Party to the Protocol, at their discretion, only to prosecute the violator if the crime is committed with the intent to incite hatred or discrimination or violence; or to use a reservation, by allowing a Party not to apply Article 6 – either partly or entirely.&lt;ref name="conventions.coe.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Reports/Html/189.htm|title=Liste complète|publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Europe's ''Explanatory Report'' of the Protocol says that the "[[European Court of Human Rights]] has made it clear that the denial or revision of 'clearly established historical facts – such as the Holocaust &amp;nbsp;– &amp;nbsp;... would be removed from the protection of Article 10 by Article 17' of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]" (see the ''[[Lehideux and Isorni v. France|Lehideux and Isorni]]'' judgement of 23 September 1998);&lt;ref name="conventions.coe.int"/&gt;

Two of the English-speaking states in Europe, Ireland and the United Kingdom, have not signed the additional protocol, (the third, Malta, signed on 28 January 2003, but has not yet ratified it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=189&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=30/11/2011&amp;CL=ENG |title=Additional Protocol to the Convention on cybercrime, concerning the criminalisation of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems (Chart of signatures and ratifications) Status as of: 30/11/2011|publisher=Council of Europe website|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 July 2005 Canada became the only non-European state to sign the convention. They were joined by South Africa in April 2008.

==Negationism in fiction==
In the novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949), by [[George Orwell]], the government of [[Oceania (fiction)|Oceania]] continually revises historical records to concord with the contemporary political explanations of The Party. When Oceania is at war with [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four|Eurasia]], the public records (newspapers, cinema, television) indicate that Oceania has been always at war with Eurasia; yet, when Eurasia and Oceania are no longer fighting each other, the historical records are subjected to negationism; thus, the populace are [[mind control|brainwashed]] to believe that Oceania and Eurasia always have been allies against Eastasia.

The protagonist of the story, [[Winston Smith]], is an editor in the [[Ministry of Truth]], responsible for effecting the continual historical revisionism that will negate the contradictions of the past upon the contemporary world of Oceania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/1984/themes.html|title=SparkNotes: 1984: Themes, Motifs &amp; Symbols|publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George ''Nineteen Eighty-four'' New American Library 1 January 1961 {{ISBN|978-0-451-52493-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To cope with the psychological stresses of life during wartime, Smith begins a diary, in which he observes that "He who controls the present, controls the past. He who controls the past, controls the future", and so illustrates the principal, ideological purpose of historical negationism.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George. [https://books.google.com/books/about/1984.html?id=yxv1LK5gyV4C ''1984''], [[New American Library]], 1961 {{ISBN|978-0-451-52493-5}}, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Franz Kurowski]] was an extremely prolific right-wing German writer who dedicated his entire career to the production of Nazi military propaganda, followed by post-war military pulp fiction and revisionist histories of [[World War II]], claiming the humane behaviour and innocence of war crimes of the [[Wehrmacht]], glorifying war as a desirable state, while fabricating eye-witness reports of atrocities allegedly committed by the Allies, especially Bomber Command and the air raids on Cologne and Dresden as planned genocide of the civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;*{{DNB portal|106231650|NAME=Franz Kurowski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Horned God.JPG|thumb|A sculpture of the Horned God Bucca of Cornish traditional witchcraft, found in the [[Museum of Witchcraft]] in [[Boscastle]], [[Cornwall]].]]

The '''Horned God''' is one of the two primary deities found in [[Wicca]] and some related forms of [[Neopaganism]]. 
The term ''Horned God'' itself predates Wicca, and is an early 20th-century [[syncretism|syncretic]] term for a horned or antlered anthropomorphic god with partly [[pseudohistorical]] origins, partly based on historical [[Horned deity|horned deities]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Bailey ''Witchcraft Historiography (review)'' in Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft - Volume 3, Number 1, Summer 2008, pp. 81-85&lt;/ref&gt;

The Horned God represents the [[God (Wicca)|male part]] of the religion's [[Wiccan ditheism|duotheistic theological system]], the [[Prince consort|consort]] of the female [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]] of the Moon or other [[Mother Goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druidry.org/library/gods-goddesses/horned-god-unofficial-autobiography |title=from the library of the Order of Bards, Ovates &amp; Druids |publisher=Druidry.org |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In common Wiccan belief, he is associated with nature, wilderness, sexuality, hunting, and the life cycle.&lt;ref name=farrargod&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Witches' God: Lord of the Dance |publisher=Robert Hale |location=London |first=Janet |last=Farrar |author2=Farrar, Stewart |year=1989 |pages= |isbn=0-7090-3319-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32–34}} Whilst depictions of the deity vary, he is always shown with either [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]s or [[antler]]s upon his head, often depicted as being [[Theriocephaly|theriocephalic]] (having a beast's head), in this way emphasizing "the union of the divine and the animal", the latter of which includes [[human]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Horns of Power |publisher=Avalonia |location=London |first=Sorita |last=d'Este |year=2008 |pages=|isbn=1-905297-17-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

In traditional Wicca ([[British Traditional Wicca]]), he is generally regarded as a [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] god of twofold aspects: bright and dark, night and day,  summer and winter,  the Oak King and the [[Holly King (archetype)|Holly King]].  In this dualistic view, his two horns symbolize, in part, his dual nature.  (The use of horns to symbolize duality is also reflected in the phrase "on the horns of a dilemma.") The three aspects of the Goddess and the two aspects of the Horned God are sometimes mapped on to the five points of the [[Pentagram]],  although which points correspond  to which deity aspects  varies. In some other systems, he is represented as a [[triple deities|triune]] [[god]], split into three aspects that reflect those of the Triple Goddess: the [[wikt:youth|Youth]] ([[Warrior]]), the [[wikt:father|Father]], and the [[Sage (philosophy)|Sage]].

The Horned God has been explored within several [[psychology|psychological]] theories and has become a recurrent theme in [[fantasy]] literature.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia_of_fantasy"&gt;

==In Wicca==
[[File:Gundestrup Cernunnos.jpg|thumb|The "Cernunnos" type antlered figure on the [[Gundestrup Cauldron]]]]

In traditional and mainstream Wicca, the Horned God is viewed as the divine male principality, being both equal and opposite to the Goddess. The Wiccan god himself can be represented in many forms, including as the [[Solar deity|Sun God]], the Sacrificed God and the Vegetation God,&lt;ref name="farrargod"/&gt; although the Horned God is the most popular representation. The pioneers of the various Wiccan or Witchcraft traditions, such as [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], [[Doreen Valiente]] and [[Roy Bowers|Robert Cochrane]], all claimed that their religion was a continuation of the [[Paganism|pagan]] religion of the [[Witch-Cult]] following historians who had purported the Witch-Cult's existence, such as [[Jules Michelet]] and [[Margaret Murray]].

For Wiccans, the Horned God is "the personification of the life force energy in animals and the wild"&lt;ref&gt;"Starhawk" in News-Week On-faith [http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/starhawk/2006/11/some_basic_definitions.html Some basic definitions] 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and is associated with [[Lord of the animals|the wilderness]], virility and [[Hunting God|the hunt]].&lt;ref name="Davy"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}} [[Doreen Valiente]] writes that the Horned God also [[Psychopomp|carries the souls of the dead to the underworld]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood"/&gt;

Wiccans generally, as well as some other neopagans, tend to conceive of the universe as polarized into gender opposites of [[masculinity|male]] and [[femininity|female]] [[Energy (esotericism)|energies]]. In traditional Wicca, the Horned God and the Goddess are seen as equal and opposite in gender polarity. However, in some of the newer traditions of Wicca, and especially those influenced by feminist ideology, there is more emphasis on the Goddess, and consequently the symbolism of the Horned God is less developed than that of the [[Goddess (Wicca)|Goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In Wicca the cycle of the seasons is celebrated during eight sabbats called The [[Wheel of the Year]]. The seasonal cycle is imagined to follow the relationship between the Horned God and the Goddess.&lt;ref name="Davy" /&gt; The Horned God is born in winter, impregnates the Goddess and then dies during the autumn and winter months and is then reborn by the Goddess at Yule.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The different relationships throughout the year are sometimes distinguished by splitting the god into aspects, the Oak King and the Holly King.&lt;ref name="Davy" /&gt; The relationships between the Goddess and the Horned God are mirrored by Wiccans in seasonal rituals. There is some variation between Wiccan groups as to which sabbat corresponds to which part of the cycle. Some Wiccans regard the Horned God as dying at Lammas, August 1; also known as Lughnasadh, which is the first harvest sabbat. Others may see him dying at Mabon, the [[autumn equinox]], or the second harvest festival. Still other Wiccans conceive of the Horned God dying on October 31, which Wiccans call [[Samhain]], the ritual of which is focused on death. He is then reborn on Winter Solstice, December 21.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}} [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] says (in 1959's ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'') that The Horned God is an Under-god, a mediator between an unknowable supreme deity and the people. (In Wiccan liturgy in the Book of Shadows, this conception of an unknowable supreme deity is referred to as "Dryghtyn." It is not a personal god, but rather an impersonal divinity similar to the Tao of Taoism.)

Whilst the Horned God is the most common depiction of masculine divinity in Wicca, he is not the only representation. Other examples include the [[Green Man]] and the [[solar deity|Sun God]].&lt;ref name=farrargod/&gt; In traditional Wicca, however, these other representations of the Wiccan god are subsumed or amalgamated into the Horned God, as aspects or expressions of him. Sometimes this is shown by adding horns or antlers to the iconography. The Green Man, for example, may be shown with branches resembling antlers; and the Sun God may be depicted with a crown or halo of solar rays, that may resemble horns. These other conceptions of the Wiccan god should not be regarded as displacing the Horned God, but rather as elaborating on various facets of his nature. Doreen Valiente has called the Horned God "the eldest of gods" in both The Witches Creed and also in her Invocation To The Horned God.

Wiccans believe that The Horned God, as Lord of Death, is their "comforter and consoler" after death and before reincarnation; and that he rules the [[Underworld]] or [[The Summerland|Summerland]] where the souls of the dead reside as they await rebirth. Some, such as Joanne Pearson, believe that this is based on the [[Mesopotamian]] myth of [[Inanna]]'s [[Inanna#Inanna's descent to the underworld|descent into the underworld]], though this has not been confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Doreen Valiente]], a former High Priestess of the [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerian tradition]], claimed that Gerald Gardner's [[Bricket Wood coven]] referred to the god as [[Cernunnos]], or '''Kernunno''', which is a Latin word, discovered on a [[pillar of the Boatmen|stone carving found in France]], meaning "the Horned One". Valiente claimed that the coven also referred to the god as '''Janicot''',{{needs IPA}} which she theorised was of [[Basque language|Basque]] origin, and Gardner also used this name in his novel ''High Magic's Aid''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Rebirth of Witchcraft |publisher=Robert Hale Ltd |first=Doreen |last=Valiente |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-7090-8369-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|52–53}}

This term had been used in the [[Quran|Qur'an]] to refer to [[Cyrus the Great]] or alternatively [[Alexander the Great]], who considered himself the son of the horned deity Ammon-Zeus, and wore horns as a part of his regalia. Margaret Murray had mentioned this information in her 1933 book ''The God of the Witches'', and Hutton theorised that [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]] had taken it from there, enjoying the fact that he shared his name with the ancient Macedonian emperor.&lt;ref name="triumph"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Triumph of the Moon: a History of Modern Pagan Witchcaraft |publisher=Oxford Paperbacks |first=Ronald |last=Hutton |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-19-285449-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|331}}

In the writings of [[Charles Cardell]] and [[Raymond Howard (Wiccan)|Raymond Howard]], the god was referred to as '''Atho'''.

==In psychology==

===Jungian analysis===
[[File:Gehörnter Gott, Enkomi.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze figurine of a "Horned God" from [[Enkomi]], Cyprus]]

Sherry Salman considers the image of the Horned God in [[Jungian]] terms, as an archetypal protector and mediator of the outside world to the objective psyche. In her theory the male psyche's 'Horned God' frequently compensates for inadequate fathering.

When first encountered, the figure is a dangerous, 'hairy chthonic wildman' possessed of kindness and intelligence. If [[psychological repression|repressed]], later in life The Horned God appears as the lord of the Otherworld, or [[Hades]]. If split off entirely, he leads to violence, substance abuse and sexual perversion. When integrated he gives the male an ego 'in possession of its own destructiveness' and for the female psyche gives an effective [[anima and animus|animus]] relating to both the physical body and the psyche.&lt;ref&gt;

In considering the Horned God as a symbol recurring in women's literature, Richard Sugg suggests the Horned God represents the 'natural Eros', a masculine lover subjugating the social-conformist nature of the female shadow, thus encompassing a combination of the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] and animus. One such example is [[Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights)|Heathcliff]] from [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''. Sugg goes on to note that female characters who are paired with this character usually end up socially ostracised, or worse &amp;ndash; in an inverted ending to the male hero-story.&lt;ref&gt;

[[horned deity|Many horned deities]] are known to have been worshipped in various cultures throughout history. Evidence for horned gods appear very early in the human record.  The so-called [[The Sorcerer (cave art)|Sorcerer]] dates from perhaps 13,000 BCE.  Twenty-one red deer headdresses, made from the skulls of the [[red deer]] and likely fitted with leather laces, have been uncovered at the Mesolithic site of [[Star Carr]].

&lt;/ref&gt; and others, [[Margaret Murray]], in her 1921 book ''[[The Witch-Cult in Western Europe]]'', proposed the theory that the witches of the early-modern period were remnants of a pagan cult and that the Christian Church had declared the god of the witches was in fact [[the Devil]]. Without recourse to any specific representation of this deity, Murray speculates that the head coverings common in [[inquisition]]-derived descriptions of the devil "may throw light on one of the possible origins of the cult."&lt;ref name="MurrayWitch"&gt;{{Cite book|authorlink=Margaret Murray |last=Murray |first=Margaret |title=The Witch-cult in Western Europe (1921)|year=2006|publisher=Standard Publications|isbn=1-59462-126-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nejamesa horned god of India.png|thumb|left|Horned God [[Naigamesha]] of the Indian sub-religion [[Kaumaram]]. Possibly from the Shunga period (1st-2nd century B.C), or earlier]]
In 1931 Murray published a sequel, ''The God of the Witches'', which tries to gather evidence in support of her witch-cult theory. In Chapter 1 "The Horned God".&lt;ref name="MurraGod"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Murray |first=Margaret |title=The God of the Witches (1931)|year=1970|isbn=0-19-501270-4|publisher=OUA USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray claims that various depictions of humans with horns from [[Europe]]an and [[India]]n sources, ranging from the [[paleolithic]] French cave painting of "[[The Sorcerer (cave art)|The Sorcerer]]" to the Indic [[Pashupati]] to the modern English [[Dorset Ooser]], are evidence for an unbroken, Europe-wide tradition of worship of a singular Horned God. Murray derived this model of a horned god cult from [[James Frazer]] and [[Jules Michelet]].&lt;ref&gt;

In dealing with "[[The Sorcerer (cave art)|The Sorcerer]]",&lt;ref name=MurrayWitch/&gt;{{rp|23–4}} the earliest evidence claimed, Murray based her observations on a drawing by [[Henri Breuil]], which some modern scholars such as Ronald Hutton claim is inaccurate.

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}}  However, others, such as celebrated prehistorian [[Jean Clottes]], assert that Breuil's sketch is indeed accurate.  Clottes stated that "I have seen it myself perhaps 20 times over the years".&lt;ref name="Cave Art Cobblers?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strangehistory.net/2011/07/06/cave-art-cobblers/|title=Cave Art Cobblers? - Beachcombing's Bizarre History Blog|date=6 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breuil considered his drawing to represent a shaman or magician - an interpretation which gives the image its name. Murray having seen the drawing called Breuil's image "the first depiction of a deity", an idea which Breuil and others later adopted.

Murray also used an inaccurate drawing of a [[mesolithic]] rock-painting at [[El Cogul|Cogul]] in northeast Spain as evidence of group religious ceremony of the cult, although the central male figure is not horned.&lt;ref name=MurrayWitch/&gt;{{rp|65}} The illustration she used of the Cogul painting leaves out a number of figures, human and animal, and the original is more likely a sequence of superimposed but unrelated illustrations, rather than a depiction of a single scene.&lt;ref name=triumph/&gt;{{rp|197}}

Despite widespread criticism of Murray's scholarship some minor aspects of her work continued to have supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ginzburg |first=Carlo |authorlink=Carlo Ginzburg |title=Ecstasies: Deciphering the Witches' Sabbath}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;ref&gt;"Other historians, like Byloff and Bonomo, have been willing to build upon the useful aspects of Murray's work without adopting its untenable elements, and the independent and careful researches of contemporary scholars have lent aspects of the Murray thesis considerable new strength." — J. B. Russell (1972) ''Witchcraft in the Middle Ages''. Cornell University Press. p.37.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Influences from literature====
The popular image of the Greek god [[Pan (god)|Pan]] was removed from its classical context in the writings of the [[Romantics]] of the 18th century and connected with their ideals of a pastoral England. This, along with the general public's increasing lack of familiarity of [[Greek mythology]] at the time led to the figure of Pan becoming generalised as a 'horned god', and applying connotations to the character, such as benevolence that were not evident in the original Greek myths which in turn gave rise to the popular acceptance of Murray's hypothetical horned god of the witches.&lt;ref name=triumph/&gt;

{{Main|Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches#Influence on Wicca and Stregheria}}
The reception of ''Aradia'' amongst Neopagans has not been entirely positive. Clifton suggests that modern claims of revealing an Italian pagan witchcraft tradition, for example those of [[Leo Martello]] and [[Raven Grimassi]], must be "match[ed] against", and compared with the claims in ''Aradia''. He further suggests that a lack of comfort with ''Aradia'' may be due to an "insecurity" within Neopaganism about the movement's claim to authenticity as a religious revival.&lt;ref name="Clifton"&gt;

Valiente offers another explanation for the negative reaction of some neopagans; that the identification of [[Lucifer]] as the god of the witches in ''Aradia'' was "too strong meat" for Wiccans who were used to the gentler, romantic paganism of Gerald Gardner and were especially quick to reject any relationship between witchcraft and [[Satanism]].&lt;ref name="Valiente61"&gt;[[Doreen Valiente|Valiente, Doreen]], quoted in Clifton, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Witch-cult hypothesis#Post-Murray}}
In 1985 Classical historian [[Georg Luck]], in his ''Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds'', theorised that the origins of the Witch-cult may have appeared in late antiquity as a faith primarily designed to worship the Horned God, stemming from the merging of [[Cernunnos]], a horned god of the Celts, with the Greco-Roman [[Pan (god)|Pan]]/[[Faunus]],&lt;ref name="LuckArcana" /&gt; a combination of gods which he posits created a new deity, around which the remaining [[pagan]]s, those refusing to convert to Christianity, rallied and that this deity provided the prototype for later Christian conceptions of the [[Devil]], and his worshippers were cast by the Church as witches.&lt;ref name="LuckArcana" /&gt;

====Influences from occultism====
[[Image:Baphomet.png|thumb|upright|The 19th century image of a Sabbatic Goat, created by [[Eliphas Levi|Eliphas Lévi]]. Baphomet serves as an historical model for Murray's concept.]]

Eliphas Levi's image of "[[Baphomet]]" serves as an example of the transformation of the Devil into a benevolent fertility deity and provided the prototype for Murray's horned god.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; Murray's central thesis that images of the Devil were actually of [[deities]] and that [[Christianity]] had demonised these worshippers as following [[Satan]], is first recorded in the work of Levi in the fashionable 19th-century [[Occult]]ist circles of England and France.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Juliette Wood, "[http://www.juliettewood.com/papers/Tarot.pdf The Celtic Tarot and the Secret Traditions: A Study in Modern Legend Making]": ''Folklore'', Vol. 109, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Levi created his image of Baphomet, published in his ''[[Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie]]'' (1855), by combining symbolism from diverse traditions, including the ''[[The Devil (Tarot card)|Diable]]'' card of the 16th and 17th century [[Tarot of Marseille]]. Lévi called his image "The Goat of Mendes", possibly following [[Herodotus]]' account&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories'' ii. 42, 46 and 166.&lt;/ref&gt; that the god of Mendes—the Greek name for Djedet, Egypt—was depicted with a goat's face and legs.  Herodotus relates how all male goats were held in great reverence by the Mendesians, and how in his time a woman publicly [[Zoophilia|copulated with a goat]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories'' ii. 46. [[Plutarch]] specifically associates [[Osiris]] with the "goat at Mendes." [http://www.sacred-texts.com/gno/th1/th140.htm ''De Iside et Osiride'', lxxiii.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. A. Wallis Budge]] writes,

{{quote|At several places in the Delta, e.g. Hermopolis, Lycopolis, and Mendes, the god Pan and a goat were worshipped; Strabo, quoting (xvii. 1, 19) Pindar, says that in these places goats had intercourse with women, and Herodotus (ii. 46) instances a case which was said to have taken place in the open day. The Mendisians, according to this last writer, paid reverence to all goats, and more to the males than to the females, and particularly to one he-goat, on the death of which public mourning is observed throughout the whole Mendesian district; they call both Pan and the goat Mendes, and both were worshipped as gods of generation and fecundity. Diodorus ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/1D*.html#ref32 i. 88]) compares the cult of the goat of Mendes with that of Priapus, and groups the god with the Pans and the Satyrs. The goat referred to by all these writers is the famous Mendean Ram, or Ram of Mendes, the cult of which was, according to Manetho, established by Kakau, the king of the IInd dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6SBLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA353|title=The Gods of the Egyptians: Or, Studies in Egyptian Mythology|first=Sir Ernest Alfred Wallis|last=Budge|date=28 July 2018|publisher=Methuen &amp; Company|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Historically, the deity that was venerated at Egyptian Mendes was a ram deity [[Banebdjedet]] (literally Ba of the lord of djed, and titled "the Lord of Mendes"), who was the soul of [[Osiris]]. Lévi combined the images of the Tarot of Marseilles Devil card and refigured the ram ''Banebdjed'' as a he-goat, further imagined by him as "copulator in Anep and inseminator in the district of Mendes".

Various scholars on early Wiccan history, such as [[Ronald Hutton]], [[Philip Heselton]], and [[Leo Ruickbie]] concur that witchcraft's early rituals, as devised by Gardner, contained much from Crowley's writings such as the [[Liber XV, The Gnostic Mass|Gnostic Mass]].

The Witch Cult hypothesis states that such stories are based upon a real-life pagan cult that revered a horned god]]

In 1908's ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' by [[Kenneth Grahame]], in Chapter 7, "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn", Ratty and Mole meet a mystical horned being, powerful, fearsome and kind.&lt;ref name="Clifton"/&gt;{{rp|85}} Grahame's work was a significant part of the cultural milieu which stripped the Greek god Pan of his cultural identity in favor of an unnamed, generic horned deity which led to Murray's thesis of historical origins.

Outside of works that predate the publication of Murray's thesis, horned god motifs and characters appear in fantasy literature that draws upon her work and that of her followers.

In the novel ''[[Childhood's End]]'' (1953) by [[Arthur C. Clarke]], all humans have a collective premonition, also described as a memory of the future, of horned aliens which arrive to usher in a new phase of human evolution. The collective subconscious image of the horned aliens is what accounts for mankind's image of the devil or Satan. This theme is also explored in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story ''[[The Dæmons]]'' in 1971,  where the local superstitions around a landmark known as The Devil's Hump prove to be based on reality, as aliens from the planet Dæmos have been affecting man's progress over the millennia and the Hump actually contains a spacecraft.  The only Dæmon to appear is a classic interpretation of a horned satyr-like being with hooves.

In the critically acclaimed and influential 1950s TV series created by [[Nigel Kneale]], ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]'', depictions of supernatural horned entities, with specific reference to prehistoric cave-art and shamanistic horned head-dress are revealed to be a "race-memory" of psychic [[Martian]] grasshoppers, manifested at the climax of the film by a fiery horned god.&lt;ref&gt;White, Eric (1996) ''Once they were men: Now they're Landcrabs: Monsterous Becomings in Evolutionist Cinema'', in

In the popular video game ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind|Morrowind]]'', its expansion ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Bloodmoon|Bloodmoon]]'' has a plot enemy known as Hircine, the Daedric god of the Hunt, who appears as a horned man with the face of a deer skull. He condemned his "hounds" ([[werewolves]]) to walk the mortal ground during the Bloodmoon until a champion defeats him or Bloodmoon falls. When in combat, Hircine appears as a horned wolf or bear.

The 1992 ''[[Discworld]]'' novel ''[[Lords and Ladies (novel)|Lords and Ladies]]'', by [[Terry Pratchett]], features a King of the Elves who is strongly reminiscent of the Horned God.  Although not worshipped by [[Witches (Discworld)|the witches]] who are the heroines of the book (indeed, quite the reverse), they temporarily ally themselves with him out of necessity.

(This article lists some of the '''states''', '''empires''', or '''dynasties''' that were ruled by a Muslim elite, or which were in some way central to or a part of a Muslim empire.)   

All the disparate Islamic Empires can all be traced back to Muhammad, as the founder not only of the Islamic faith but also the first leader of the Muslim people.   

Scholars debate what exactly constitutes an [[empire]]. One definition defines an empire as a [[Sovereign state|state]] that extends [[dominion]] over areas and populations [[culturally]] and [[ethnically]] distinct  from the culture/ethnicity at the center of power.  

== History of Muslim states==
The [[early Muslim conquests]] began in the lifetime of [[Muhammad]]. His successors conquered large swaths of the Middle East and North Africa, in addition to parts of [[southern Europe]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]], in the decades after his death.  The [[caliphate]] founded by his earliest successors, called the [[Rashidun caliphate]], was succeeded by the [[Umayyad caliphate]] and later the [[Abbasid caliphate]].

While the caliphates gradually fractured and fell, other Muslim dynasties rose; some of these dynasties grew into "Islamic empires", with some of the most notable being the Safavid, Ottoman, and Mughal Empires.

== Caliphates ==

[[File:La masacre de San Bartolomé, por François Dubois.jpg|380px|thumb|The [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] (August 23, 1572) in Paris, France (painting by [[François Dubois]])]]
&lt;!--This list may be in the process of being phased out due to its extreme size and impracticality. If you are thinking of adding another massacre to this list, please instead consider adding it to the list of massacres in the country in which it occurred. If a list of massacres in that country is yet to have been created, please consider creating it, following the format for the existing lists. See discussion for more details.--&gt;
&lt;!--Need to add: Jonestown Massacre--&gt;

The following is a list of events for which one of the commonly accepted names includes the word "[[massacre]]."&lt;ref name=Mikaberidze&gt;{{harvnb|Mikaberidze|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[:wikt:massacre|Massacre]]'' is defined in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' as "the indiscriminate and brutal slaughter of people or (less commonly) animals; carnage, butchery, slaughter in numbers". It also states that the term is used "in the names of certain massacres of history".&lt;ref name=OED_N&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, n.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first recorded use in English of the word ''massacre'' in the name of an event is due to [[Christopher Marlow]] who in c. 1600 referred to what is now known as the  [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] as "The massacre at Paris"&lt;ref&gt;"Marlowe (c. 1600) (''title'') The massacre at Paris". [[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, n.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
''Massacre'' can also be used as a verb, as "To kill (people or, less commonly, animals) in numbers, esp. brutally and indiscriminately".&lt;ref name=OED_V/&gt; The first usage of which was "(c. 1588) Men which make no conscience for gaine sake, to breake the law of the æternall, and massaker soules (...) are dangerous subjects",&lt;ref name=OED_V&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, v.&lt;/ref&gt; and this usage is not recorded in this list.--&gt;

The purpose of the list is to trace such of the term "massacre" specifically.
There are many alternative terms with similar connotations, such as [[:wikt:butchery|butchery]], [[:wikt:carnage|carnage]],  [[:wikt:bloodbath|bloodbath]], [[:wikt:mass killing|mass killing]], [[wikt:atrocity|atrocity]], etc. as well as euphemisms such as ''[[Sicilian Vespers|Vespers]]'', ''[[Blutgericht]]'' or "attack", "incident", "tragedy" (etc.), use of which are outside the scope of this list.
''Massacre'' is also used figuratively to describe dramatic events that did not involve any deaths, such as the "[[Hilo massacre]]" and the "[[Saturday Night Massacre]]"; this usage is also outside of the scope of this list.

==List of events==
&lt;!--This list may be in the process of being reduced in size due to current unwieldiness; events listed should only include events very widely, or overwhelmingly known under a name including the term "massacre".  If you are thinking of adding another massacre to this list, please instead consider adding it to the list of massacres in the country in which it occurred. If a list of massacres in that country is yet to have been created, please consider creating it, following the format for the existing lists. See discussion for more details.--&gt;
&lt;!--
;Inclusion criteria
#Inclusion in this list is based ''solely'' on evidence in multiple [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable sources]] that a name including the word "massacre" is one of the accepted names for that event. A reliable source that merely describes the event as ''being'' a massacre does not qualify the event for inclusion in this list. The word ''massacre'' must appear in the source as part of a ''name'' for the event.
#If possible, cite the date of the earliest authority giving the name in question under the "name" column
#Where there is dispute over this, discussion should be [[WP:MULTI|centralized]]. If it is discussed on the talk page of the article concerned, a link should be posted on the talk page of this list; if the discussion is on the talk page of this list, a link should be posted at the article's talk page.
;Notes
#Any name for the event which is established by use of [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable sources]] as being one of the accepted terms would usually also be included in the article on that event.
#Inclusion in this list does not ''of itself'' justify inclusion in the article, and nor does use of the name in an article justify inclusion in this list, because Wikipedia is not a [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable source]]. Both uses must be based directly on explicit references to the sources, which should be cited in footnotes. However, it is hard to envisage any situation where a name including "massacre" could be included in this list but not mentioned in an article on the event (or vice versa); if that situation should arise, both the uses should be carefully examined.--&gt;
&lt;!--''Note: the location column will sort by the following [[United Nations geoscheme|sub regions]]: Eastern Africa, Southern Africa, Central America, North America, South America, Eastern Asia, South-eastern Asia, Southern Asia, Western Asia, Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, Southern Europe, Western Europe, and Oceania''--&gt;

''massacre de la Saint-Barthélemy'' which term had been in use since the 17th century (Louis Maimbourg, ''Histoire De La Ligue'', 1686).
Appositional "St. Bartholomew's Day massacre" (rather than genitival "Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day") first appears in American English in the first half of the 20th century (Oberlin Alumni Magazine 31.4, 1935, p. 102).&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Boston Massacre]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The event was almost immediately termed a "massacre" and used for propagandistic purposes, especially by [[Samuel Adams]]. A pamphlet with the title ''A short narrative of the horrid massacre in Boston, perpetrated in the evening of the fifth day of March, 1770, by soldiers of the 29th regiment, which with the 14th regiment were then quartered there; with some observations on the state of things prior to that catastrophe'' was printed still in 1770.
Appositional "Boston massacre" was in use by the early 1800s (Benjamin Austin, ''Constitutional Republicanism, in Opposition to Fallacious Federalism'', 1803, 
 [https://books.google.ch/books?id=fvY-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 p. 314]).
The term "[[Massacre Day]]" for the annual remembrance  held during 1771&amp;ndash;1783 dates to the late 19th century (Augusta De Grasse Stevens, ''Old Boston: An American Historical Romance'', 1888, p. 126) The 1772 "Massacre Day of Oration" by [[Joseph Warren]] was originally titled ''An Oration Delivered March 5th, 1772. At the Request of the Inhabitants of the Town of Boston; to Commemorate the Bloody Tragedy of the Fifth of March, 1770''.

Questionable list entries also include such names for pre-1930s events which were coined only significantly later.

|During the 1990s, many [[Algerian Civil War#Village massacres|large-scale massacres of villagers]] in Algeria were perpetrated by groups attacking villages at night and cutting the throats of the inhabitants. The [[Armed Islamic Group]] (GIA) has avowed its responsibility for many of them. The massacres peaked in 1997 (with a smaller peak in 1994). According to a few reports former Algerian army officer, Habib Souaidia testified to his government's involvement in the massacres. The differing accounts are not yet reconciled.&lt;ref name="Bedjaoui"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Algeria-Watch |url=http://www.algeria-watch.org/farticle/sale_guerre/guardian.htm |title='I saw Algerian soldiers massacre civilians' |publisher=Algeria-watch.org |date=2001-02-14 |accessdate=2013-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Urgent_Action/apic51698.html |title=Algeria: Amnesty Article, 5/16/98 |publisher=Africa.upenn.edu |date=1998-05-16 |accessdate=2013-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equalitynow.org/english/campaigns/un/unhrc_reports/unhrc_algeria_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 6, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104180256/http://www.equalitynow.org/english/campaigns/un/unhrc_reports/unhrc_algeria_en.pdf |archivedate=January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic consensus is that at least the majority of the massacres were carried out by Islamist radicals, however, the government notably failed to intervene in a number of these massacres.&lt;ref&gt;Kalyvas, Stathis N. [http://research.yale.edu/stathis/files/Wanton.pdf "Wanton and Senseless?: The Logic of Massacres in Algeria"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912003025/http://research.yale.edu/stathis/files/Wanton.pdf |date=2008-09-12 }} ''Rationality and Society'' 1999; 11: "The most important evidence comes from testimonies of survivors who were able to identify local Islamists among the attackers (see below). In fact, survivors who openly accuse the army for its failure to intervene also expressed no doubt about the identity of the killers, pointing to the Islamist guerrillas (e.g. Tuquoi 1997). Moreover, some of the troubling aspects of this story can be explained without reference to an army conspiracy. For example, in civil wars prisoners tend to be killed on the spot rather than taken prisoner (Laqueur 1998).11 Militiamen, the most likely to capture guerrillas, have openly stated that they took no prisoners (AI 1997b: 17). Journalists working in the field have found credible testimonies in support of the thesis that most massacres are organized by the rebels (Leclère 1997; Tuquoi 1997 among others). European foreign ministries believe that it is Islamist guerrillas who are responsible for the massacres (Observer 9 February 1998). Although, it is impossible to know the full truth at this point (see Charef 1998), the assumption that many massacres were committed by the Islamist guerrillas seems plausible and is widely adopted by area experts (Addi 1998: 44) and other authors (Smith 1998: 27). Likewise, the reluctance of the army to intervene and stop some of these massacres is also beyond doubt."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4242">The '''Maria Rogers Oral History Program''', or '''MROHP''', collects and archives oral histories about [[Boulder County]]. Started in 1976, the program began with a handful of donated interviews, but now includes more than 1600 interviews, available both on the internet and at the [[Boulder Public Library]]'s Carnegie Branch Library for Local History.

== The Woman Behind the Collection ==

The Oral History Program is named for Maria M. Rogers, the woman who directed and developed the program for more than twelve years from 1985 to 1997. Maria gleaned information from hundreds of the program's oral history interviews for her book, ''In Other Words: Oral Histories of the Colorado Frontier'',&lt;ref&gt;p://nell.boulder.lib.co.us/search~S11?/aRogers%2C+Maria/arogers+maria/1%2C1%2C36%2CB/exact&amp;FF=arogers+maria+m+1938+1997&amp;1%2C36%2C/indexsort=r&lt;/ref&gt; which captures the personal and public history of the pioneers and early residents of Colorado.

==About the Collection==

The Maria Rogers Oral History Program Collection contained more than 1,650 interviews as of 2010, with 40 to 100 new interviews being added each year.  Many of the interviews have been recorded, transcribed and archived by volunteers for the program. Some interviews have been donated to the collection by other educational, governmental, and cultural organizations or individuals in the community.

The interviews are about all aspects of life in Boulder County, providing a detailed account of both daily life and major events. The lives of a wide range of people are recorded, including pioneers and other settlers, cattlemen, farmers, housewives, university professors, local government officials and political activists, attorneys, physicians, coal miners, teachers, artists, scientists, and more.  Although interviews are drawn from residents of Boulder County, they often cover topics that are of general interest, such as city planning and open space, political activism, mountaineering and issues involving the disposal of nuclear waste, among many others.

==Digital Archive - Access==

Donations from the Rogers family and from the Boulder Library Foundation have allowed the program to digitize all of its interviews and create a digital archive that is linked to the Boulder Public Library's catalog, making it easy to research the contents of the interviews by doing a search for names, places or keywords. [http://nell.boulderlibrary.org]

The collection is housed in the Carnegie Library for Local History, a branch of the Boulder Public Library, located at 1125 Pine Street in Boulder, Colorado. Patrons may listen to audio of all of the interviews or watch DVDs of the newer interviews at the library.  Access to files that often include supplementary information about the narrators is also available at the library.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2375">'''Metahistorical Romance''' is a term describing postmodern historical fiction, defined by Amy J. Elias in ''Sublime Desire: History and Post-1960s Fiction.'' Elias defines metahistorical romance as a form of historical fiction continuing the legacy of historical romance inaugurated by [[Sir Walter Scott]] but also having ties to contemporary postmodern historiography. In particular, in metahistorical romance, poststructuralist play invokes the "historical sublime" as defined in the work of [[Hayden White]]. Metahistorical romance--such as [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s novel ''[[Mason &amp; Dixon]]''--attempts to recuperate the sublime untouchability of the past, to reach History and know it, but paradoxically in the context of the political. As with the Kantian sublime, the postmodern historical sublime is not the grasp of the sublime object itself but a kind of ironic awareness of the inaccessibility of the sublime object. There is a yearning that resembles the yearning for mystical knowledge at the core of the search for the historical sublime, and thus the concept ties contemporary historical fiction to a literary history (that of the historical novel), a type of historiography (postmodern, post-''[[Annales School|Annales]]'' historiography), and a spiritual questing. Elias argues that the postmodern imagination confronts the historical sublime rather than represses it; confronts it as repetition and deferral; seeks sublime History but simultaneously has lost faith in the storytelling needed to do so; and consequently has ties to, but reverses the dominant of, the traditional Anglo-American historical novel. The term "metahistorical romance" also builds upon work by [[Linda Hutcheon]], whose term "[[historiographic metafiction]]" described the ironic stance of contemporary historical fiction.

[[File:SolarEclipse BC 1335-03-13.gif|thumb|right|200px|The eclipse of 1335]]
The [[solar eclipse]] mentioned in a text dating to the reign of [[Mursili II]] could be of great importance for the absolute chronology of the [[Hittite Empire]] within the [[chronology of the Ancient Near East]]. The text records that in the tenth year of Mursili's reign, "the Sun gave a sign" (''{{lang|hit|istanus sakiyahta}}''), just as the king was about to launch a campaign against the Kingdom of [[Azzi-Hayasa]] in north-eastern Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;KUB XIV 4.24: [''ma-a-an I-NA'' KUR ''A'']''zi-ma i-ia-ah-at nu'' &lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;[[Shamash|UTU]]''-us sa-ki-ya-ah-ta'' "[When] I marched [to the land of A]zzi, the Sungod gave a sign." Theo P. J. Van Den Hout, ''The Purity of Kingship: An Edition of CTH 569 and Related Hittite Oracle Inquiries of Tutẖaliya'' (1998),  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7DTPyG4VvpcC&amp;pg=PA42  42f.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The reference in the annals was first interpreted as describing an eclipse by [[Emil Forrer]] (1926),&lt;ref&gt;E. Forrer,  ''Forschungen II'' 1.1 "Astronomische Festlegung des Soppiluljomas, Morsilis und Amenophis IV." (1926) KUB XIV,4 (= CTH 70).&lt;/ref&gt; Schorr (1928) identified it as the  eclipse the  of 13 March 1335 BC, visible as [[annular eclipse|annular]] in Anatolia in the afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;''Astronomische Abhandlungen''  8-9 (1929), p. 16. ''Mitteilungen des Instituts für Orientforschung  6 (1958), 188.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is now more commonly identified as the one of 24 June 1312, which was visible in [[total eclipse|totality]] in northern Anatolia in the afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce (1998){{page needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Paul Åström]] (1993) proposes the alternative date of 13 April 1308, which would have been visible as partial eclipse at sunrise. [[Peter J. Huber]] has suggested a date of 8 January 1339 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Huber, The Solar Omen of Muršili II,  Journal of the American Oriental Society, vol. 121, no. 4, pp. 640-644, (Oct. - Dec., 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==1312 eclipse==
The 1312 eclipse occurred over northern Anatolia in the early afternoon, and its effects would have been quite spectacular for Mursili and his men on campaign:
:24 June 1312 BC, total eclipse, maximum at 10:44 UTC, {{coord|38.2|N|13.7|E}} ([[Sicily]]) and lasted 2 min 48 sec, some stated as it occurred inside the [[Ionian Sea]] at 17 E.

Areas that were inside the maximum eclipse included the islands that are now Barlavento in [[Cape Verde]], the Moorish lands (comprising modern day [[Mauritania]], [[Western Sahara]], [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]]), [[Tunisia]] (then inner Africa), [[Greece]], the [[Caucasus]] region, Persia (now Iran), in the area of the present-day Iranian-Turkmeni border, present-day Afghanistan and Pakistan and a part of the north of [[India]].

The eclipse started off in modern-day [[Brazil]] in South America and finished in what is now [[Myanmar]] (also known as [[Burma]]).

The 1312 date would imply that Mursili began his reign in either 1322 or 1321 BC. This date would be roughly that usually proposed for the death of [[Tutankhamun]]. It is known that [[Suppiluliuma I]] was besieging [[Carchemish]] when he received a letter from the widow of a [[Pharaoh]] (who is called [[Dakhamunzu]] in the annals). Suppiluliuma died shortly thereafter and his successor was Mursili II (whose brother would have been Prince [[Zannanza]] sent to Egypt where he died). Thus this appears to be a chronological anchor. However, there are other views, asserting for example that the dead Pharaoh was [[Akhenaten]] or that Tutankhamun died later.

==1308 eclipse==
In contrast, the 1308 eclipse was annular, and began very early in the morning over [[Arabia]] (and only [[penumbral]] over Anatolia and Syria), reaching its height over [[Central Asia]]:
:13 April 1308 BC, annular eclipse (94.8%), maximum at 04:16 UTC, {{coord|44.9|N|85.7|E}} ([[Tian Shan]]) and lasted 4 min 40 sec.

Other areas that had inside the band of the annular eclipse included the [[Indus River|Indus Delta]] and parts of [[Siberia]] including the [[New Siberian Islands]]. The maximum eclipse ended at sunset over the [[Beaufort Sea]] along with the [[Bering Sea]] and the westernmost portion of [[Alaska]] with the west of the [[Aleutian Islands]].  The eclipse covered much of Asia except for the southwesternmost portions and the southeastern islands, one of the islands that was near the edge of the eclipse was [[Honshū]], Japan.

The '''New Chronology''' is a [[pseudohistory|pseudohistorical theory]] which argues that the conventional [[chronology]] of Middle Eastern and European history is fundamentally flawed, and that events attributed to the civilizations of the [[Roman Empire]], [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Egypt]] actually occurred during the [[Middle Ages]], more than a thousand years later. The central concepts of the New Chronology are derived from the ideas of Russian scholar [[Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov|Nikolai Morozov]] (1854–1946),&lt;ref name="billington83"&gt;{{cite book |last=Billington |first=James H. |title=Russia in Search of Itself |publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |year=2004 |pages=83 |quote=The radical revisionism of Nosovsky and Fomenko's ''New Chronology of Rus'' has its origins in the attempt by Nicholai Morozov to synthesize science and history during twenty-five years in prison}}&lt;/ref&gt; although work by French scholar [[Jean Hardouin]] (1646–1729) can be viewed as an earlier predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colavito|2004}} "Today an intellectual successor to Hardouin claims that it is not classical antiquity that was forged, but instead the history of the Middle Ages. Russian mathematician Anatoly Fomenko has devised a system he calls the 'New Chronology'..."&lt;/ref&gt; However, the New Chronology is most commonly associated with Russian mathematician [[Anatoly Fomenko]] (born 1945), although published works on the subject are actually a collaboration between Fomenko and several other mathematicians. The concept is most fully explained in ''History: Fiction or Science?'', originally published in [[Russian language|Russian]].

The New Chronology also contains ''a reconstruction'', an alternative chronology, radically shorter than the standard historical timeline, because all ancient history is "folded" onto the Middle Ages. According to Fomenko's claims, the [[recorded history|written history]] of humankind goes only as far back as [[Anno Domini|AD]] 800, there is almost no information about events between AD 800–1000, and most known historical events took place in AD 1000–1500.

The New Chronology is rejected by mainstream [[historian]]s and is inconsistent with [[absolute dating|absolute]] and [[relative dating]] techniques used in the wider [[academia|scholarly community]]. The majority of scientific commentators consider The New Chronology to be [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]].&lt;ref name="prezRAS1999"&gt;[http://rc.nsu.ru/text/news/Physics/057.html Проблемы борьбы с лженаукой (обсуждение в Президиуме РАН)] — {{Interlanguage link multi|Вестник Российской академии наук|ru}} 1999, том&amp;nbsp;69, №&amp;nbsp;10, с.&amp;nbsp;879—904&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prezRAS2003"&gt;[http://vivovoco.rsl.ru/VV/JOURNAL/VRAN/2004/FALSCI.HTM Чем угрожает обществу лженаука?

Nosovskiy and Bulgarian mathematician Iordan Tabov who expanded the theory in regards to the Balkans, the theory is mostly discussed in reference to Fomenko's writings.&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt;

==History of New Chronology==
The idea of chronologies that differ from the conventional chronology can be traced back to at least the early 17th century. [[Jean Hardouin]] then suggested that many ancient historical documents were much younger than commonly believed to be. In 1685 he published a version of [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' in which he claimed that most Greek and Roman texts had been forged by [[Benedictine]] monks. When later questioned on these results, Hardouin stated that he would reveal the monks' reasons in a letter to be revealed only after his death. The executors of his estate were unable to find such a document among his posthumous papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Diacu | first = Florin

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]], examining the current chronology of [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Egypt]] and the [[Ancient Near East]], expressed discontent with prevailing theories and in ''[[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended]]'' proposed one of his own, which, basing its study on [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]'s ''[[Argonautica]]'', changed the traditional dating of the Argonautic Expedition, the [[Trojan War]], and the [[Founding of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1887, [[Edwin Johnson (historian)|Edwin Johnson]] expressed the opinion that [[early Christianity|early Christian history]] was largely invented or corrupted in the 2nd and 3rd centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.radikalkritik.de/AntiquaMater1.pdf | last = Johnson | first = Edwin | authorlink = Edwin Johnson (historian) | title = Antiqua Mater | chapter = Preface | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060911155951/http://www.radikalkritik.de/AntiquaMater1.pdf | archivedate = 2006-09-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 [[Otto Rank]] made note of duplications in literary history of a variety of cultures:

&lt;blockquote&gt;almost all important civilized peoples have early woven myths around and glorified in poetry their heroes, mythical kings and princes, founders of religions, of dynasties, empires and cities—in short, their national heroes. Especially the history of their birth and of their early years is furnished with phantastic traits; the amazing similarity, nay literal identity, of those tales, even if they refer to different, completely independent peoples, sometimes geographically far removed from one another, is well known and has struck many an investigator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rank | first = Otto | authorlink = Otto Rank
 | title = Der Mythos von der Geburt des Helden | language = German }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fomenko became interested in Morozov's theories in 1973. In 1980, together with a few colleagues from the mathematics department of [[Moscow State University]], he published several articles on "new mathematical methods in history" in peer-reviewed journals.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The articles stirred a lot of controversy, but ultimately Fomenko failed to win any respected historians to his side. By the early 1990s, Fomenko shifted his focus from trying to convince the scientific community via peer-reviewed publications to publishing books. Beam writes that Fomenko and his colleagues were discovered by the Soviet scientific press in the early 1980s, leading to "a brief period of renown"; a contemporary review from the Soviet journal ''Questions of History'' complained, "Their constructions have nothing in common with Marxist historical science."&lt;ref name="beam"&gt;{{cite news|title=A shorter history of civilization|last=Beam|first=Alex|date=1991-09-16|work=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1996 his theory had grown to cover Russia, Turkey, China, Europe, and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Nosovsky G. V., Fomenko A. T., "Empire. Russia, Turkey, China, Europe, Egypt. New mathematical chronology of ancient times / Носовский Г. В., Фоменко А. Т. Империя. Русь, Турция, Китай, Европа, Египет. Новая математическая хронология древности." (in Russian), 1996, with at least 6 later editions — М.: Факториал, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fomenko's claims==
{{primary sources|date=May 2015}}
Central to Fomenko's New Chronology is his claim of the existence of a vast Slav-Turk empire, which he called the "Russian Horde", which he says played the dominant role in Eurasian history before the 17th century. The various peoples identified in ancient and medieval history, from the [[Scythians]], [[Huns]], [[Goths]] and [[Bulgars]], through the [[Polans (eastern)|Polyane]], [[Dulebes|Duleby]], [[Drevlyans|Drevliane]], [[Pechenegs]], to in more recent times, the [[Cossacks]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Belarusians]], are nothing but elements of the single Russian Horde. For the New Chronologists, peoples such as the Ukrainians, Belarusians, [[Mongols#Russia|Mongols]], and others who assert their national independence from Russia, are suffering from a historical delusion.&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) pp. 5, 8, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko claims that the most probable prototype of the historical Jesus was [[Andronikos I Komnenos]] (allegedly AD 1152 to 1185), the emperor of Byzantium, known for his failed reforms; his traits and deeds reflected in 'biographies' of many real and imaginary persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | author = Фоменко А.Т. |author2=Носовский Г.В.
 | script-title=ru:Царь Славян | language = Russian
 | publisher = СПб.: Нева | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical [[Jesus]] is a composite figure and reflection of the Old-Testament prophet [[Elisha]] (850–800 BC?), [[Pope Gregory VII]] (1020?–1085), Saint [[Basil of Caesarea]] (330–379), and even [[Li Yuanhao]] (also known as Emperor Jingzong or "Son of Heaven" - emperor of [[Western Xia]], who reigned in 1032–48), Euclides, Bacchus and Dionysius. Fomenko explains the seemingly vast differences in the biographies of these figures as resulting from difference in languages, points of view and time-frame of the authors of said accounts and biographies. He claims that the historical Jesus may have been born in 1152 and was crucified around AD 1185 on the [[Joshua's Hill]], overlooking the [[Bosphorus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = А.Т.Фоменко | author2 = Г.В.Носовский | title = Датировка Рождества Христова серединой XII века | language = Russian | url = http://chronologia.org/car/04cs1.html | format = download | accessdate = 2008-04-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080413014454/http://www.chronologia.org/car/04cs1.html | archivedate = 2008-04-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko also merges the cities and histories of Jerusalem, Rome and Troy into "New Rome" = Gospel [[Jerusalem]] (in the 12th and 13th centuries) = [[Troy]] = [[Yoros Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Фоменко А.Т. |author2=Носовский Г.В.

 | publisher = М.: Астрель, АСТ | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the south of [[Yoros Castle]] is [[Joshua's Hill]] which Fomenko alleges is the hill [[Calvary]] depicted in the Bible.

Fomenko claims the [[Hagia Sophia]] is actually the biblical [[Temple of Solomon]]. He identifies Solomon as sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] (1494–1566).

On the other hand, according to Fomenko the word "Rome" is a placeholder and can signify any one of several different cities and kingdoms. He claims the "First Rome" or "Ancient Rome" or "Mizraim" is an ancient Egyptian kingdom in the delta of the [[Nile]] with its capital in [[Alexandria]]. The second and most famous "New Rome" is Constantinople. The third "Rome" is constituted by three different cities: Constantinople (again), Rome in Italy, and Moscow. According to his claims, Rome in Italy was founded around AD 1380 by [[Aeneas]] and Moscow as the third Rome was the capital of the great "Russian Horde".&lt;ref&gt;Dmitrii Sidorov, "Post-Imperial Third Romes: Resurrections of a Russian Orthodox Geopolitical Metaphor", ''Geopolitics'', 11 (2006):317–347, at pp. 336-7 .&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Specific claims===
{{cleanup list|date=May 2015}}
In volumes 1, 2, 3 and 4 of ''History: Fiction or Science?'', Fomenko and his colleagues make numerous claims:
* Historians and translators often "assign" different dates and locations to different accounts of the same historical events, creating multiple "phantom copies" of these events. These "phantom copies" are often misdated by centuries or even millennia and end up incorporated into conventional chronology.
* This chronology was largely manufactured by [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] in ''Opus Novum de emendatione temporum'' (1583) and ''Thesaurum temporum'' (1606), and represents a vast array of dates produced without any justification whatsoever, containing the repeating sequences of dates with shifts equal to multiples of the major cabbalistic numbers 333 and 360. The [[Jesuit]] [[Denis Pétau|Dionysius Petavius]] completed this chronology in ''De Doctrina Temporum'', 1627 (v.1) and 1632 (v.2).
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One might wonder why we should want to revise the chronology of ancient history today and base our revision on new empirical-statistical methods. It would be worthwhile to remind the reader that in the XVI-XVII century chronology was considered to be a subdivision of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Issue with Chronology | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* 37 complete Egyptian [[horoscope]]s found in Denderah, Esna, and other temples have unique valid astronomical solutions with dates ranging from AD 1000 and up to as late as AD 1700. &lt;blockquote&gt;
The vocabulary of Egyptian astronomical symbols once applied to horoscopes from temples allows for extraction of unique dates of eclipses. Astronomical data therein contained is sufficient for unique dating. There are symbols allowing for astronomical interpretation and the symbols do not change from one temple horoscope to another. The horoscopes from temples contain data about eclipses visible in Egypt allowing their exact pinpointing on the time axis.&lt;ref name="Fomenko"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = Astronomy Vs History | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The [[Book of Revelation]], as we know it, contains a horoscope, dated to 25 September - 10 October 1486, compiled by cabbalist [[Johannes Reuchlin]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As we have already noted, the inability of the latter day commentators to comprehend the astronomical symbolism of the Apocalypse is directly resulting from the loss of knowledge about the correct chronology and the distortions introduced by historians of the XVI-XVIII century. Another possibility is that there was an unspoken general taboo on what concerned a subject quite as dangerous, which resulted in the misdating of the Apocalypse. One way or another, the understanding of the astronomical descriptions that the Apocalypse contains got lost at some point. The Apocalypse had lost its distinctive astronomical hue in the eyes of the readers. However, its “astronomical component” is not simply exceptionally important – it alone suffices for the dating of the book itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Apocalypse as seen by Astronomy | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The horoscopes found in Sumerian/Babylonian tablets do not contain sufficient astronomical data; consequently, they have solutions every 30–50 years on the time axis and are therefore useless for purposes of dating.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The vocabulary of Babylonian astronomical symbols once applied to clay tablets don't allow for extraction of unique dates of eclipses. Astronomical data therein contained is not sufficient for unique dating. Either there not enough symbols allowing for astronomical interpretation or  the symbols change from one clay tablet to another. The clay tablets contain data about eclipses visible in Babylon  that could have taken place  every 30-40 years, therefore don’t allow there exact pinpointing on the time axis.&lt;ref name="Fomenko"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The Chinese tables of eclipses are useless for dating, as they contain too many eclipses that did not take place astronomically. Chinese tables of comets, even if true, cannot be used for dating.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chinese eclipse observations can neither confirm nor refute any chronology of China at all, be it veracious or erroneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Issue with Chinese Astronomy | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Fomenko's methods==
{{primary sources|date=May 2015}}

===Statistical correlation of texts===
One of Fomenko's simplest methods is statistical [[correlation]] of texts. His basic assumption is that a text which describes a sequence of events will devote more space to more important events (for example, a period of [[war]] or an [[unrest]] will have much more space devoted to than a period of [[peace]]ful, non-eventful years), and that this irregularity will remain visible in other descriptions of the period. For each analysed text, a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is devised which maps each year mentioned in the text with the number of pages (lines, letters) devoted in the text to its description (which could be zero). The function of the two texts are then compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = History: Fiction or Science? Chronology 1

 | chapter = 1. The local maxima method | pages = 187–194
 | accessdate = 2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Fomenko compares the contemporary history of Rome written by [[Titus Livius]] with a modern history of Rome written by [[Russia]]n [[historian]] [[Vladimir Sergeevich Sergeev|V. S. Sergeev]], calculating that the two have high [[correlation]], and thus that they describe the same period of history, which is undisputed.&lt;ref name=F2&gt;{{cite book

 | accessdate = 2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also compares modern texts which describe different periods, and calculates low correlation, as expected.&lt;ref name=F2/&gt; However, when he compares, for example, the ancient history of Rome and the medieval history of Rome, he calculates a high correlation, and concludes that ancient history of Rome is a copy of medieval history of Rome, thus clashing with mainstream accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. | authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical correlation of dynasties===
[[Image:Fomenko - Roman Empire parallelism.jpg|thumb|Sample Fomenko parallelism]]
In a somewhat similar manner, Fomenko compares two [[dynasty|dynasties]] of rulers using statistical methods. First, he creates a [[database]] of rulers, containing relevant information on each of them. Then, he creates "survey codes" for each pair of the rulers, which contain a number which describes degree of the match of each considered property of two rulers. For example, one of the properties is the way of death: if two rulers were both poisoned, they get value of +1 in their property of the way of death; if one ruler was poisoned and another killed in combat, they get -1; and if one was poisoned, and another died of illness, they get 0 (Fomenko claims there is possibility that chroniclers were not impartial and that different descriptions nonetheless describe the same person). An important property is the length of the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. |authorlink= Anatoly Fomenko
 | title = History: Fiction or Science? Chronology 1 | pages = 215–223

 | accessdate = 2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko lists a number of pairs of unrelated dynasties &amp;ndash; for example, dynasties of kings of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and emperors of late [[Western Roman Empire]] (AD 300-476) &amp;ndash; and claims that this method demonstrates correlations between their reigns. (Graphs which show just the length of the rule in the two dynasties are the most widely known; however, Fomenko's conclusions are also based on other parameters, as described above.) He also claims that the regnal history from the 17th to 20th centuries never shows correlation of "dynastic flows" with each other, therefore Fomenko insists history was multiplied and outstretched into imaginary antiquity to justify this or other "royal" pretensions.

Fomenko uses for the demonstration of correlation between the reigns exclusively the data from the ''Chronological Tables'' of J. Blair (Moscow 1808–09). Fomenko says that Blair’s tables are all the more valuable to us since they were compiled in an epoch adjacent to the time of Scaligerian chronology. According to Fomenko these tables contain clearer signs of “Scaligerite activity” which were subsequently buried under layers of paint and plaster by historians of the 19th and 20th centuries.

===Astronomical evidence===
Fomenko examines astronomical events described in ancient texts and claims that the chronology is actually [[medieval]]. For example:

* He says the mysterious drop in the value of the lunar acceleration parameter D" ("a linear combination of the [angular] accelerations of the Earth and Moon"&lt;ref name="Newton72"&gt;[[Robert Russell Newton|R.R. Newton]], [http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/atext/newton1.htm "Astronomical Evidence Concerning Non-Gravitational Forces in the Earth–Moon System"]. ''[[Astrophysics and Space Science]]'' vol. 16 (1972), pp. 179–200.&lt;/ref&gt;) between the years AD 700–1300, which the American astronomer [[Robert Russell Newton|Robert Newton]] had explained in terms of "non-gravitational" (i.e., tidal) forces.&lt;ref name="Newton72"/&gt; By eliminating those anomalous early eclipses the New Chronology produces a constant value of D" beginning around AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;Anatoly T. Fomenko, ''History: Fiction or Science'' vol.I, Chronology, 2nd. ed. (Paris, London, New York: Delamere Publishing, 2006), pp.93-94, 105-6. Newton's analysis has since been criticized as suffering "from two fundamental defects. The two parameters he sought to determine were highly correlated; and he also adopted a somewhat arbitrary weighting scheme in analysing suspected observations of total solar eclipses. Many of the observations he investigated were of doubtful reliability. Hence, despite the low weight he assigned them, they had a disproportionate effect on his solutions." F. Richard Stephenson, "Historical Eclipses and Earth's Rotation", [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/action/showPdf?submitPDF=Full+Text+PDF+%28243+KB%29&amp;doi=10.1046%2Fj.1468-4004.2003.44222.x ''Astronomy &amp; Geophysics''], 44 (2003): 2.23-2.24.&lt;/ref&gt;
* He associates initially the [[Star of Bethlehem]] with the AD 1140 (±20) [[supernova]] (now [[Crab Nebula]]) and the [[Chronology of Jesus|Crucifixion Eclipse]] with the total [[solar eclipse]] of AD 1170 (±20). He also believes that [[Crab Nebula]] [[supernova]] could not have been seen in AD 1054, but probably in AD 1153. He connects it with total eclipse of AD 1186. Moreover he holds in strong doubt the veracity of ancient Chinese astronomical data.
* He argues that the [[star catalog]] in the ''Almagest'', ascribed to the Hellenistic astronomer [[Claudius Ptolemy]], was compiled in the 15th to 16th centuries AD. With this objective in sight he develops new methods of dating old stellar catalogues and claims that the ''Almagest'' is based on data collected between AD 600 and 1300, whereby the telluric obliquity{{clarify|date=June 2013}} is well taken into account.
* He refines and completes [[Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov|Morozov's]] analysis of some ancient [[horoscopes]], most notably, the so-called [[Dendera Temple complex|Dendera Zodiacs]]—two horoscopes drawn on the ceiling of the [[Hathor temple|temple of Hathor]]—and comes to the conclusion that they correspond to either the 11th or the 13th century AD. Moreover, in his ''History: Fiction or Science'' series finale, he makes computer-aided dating of all 37 Egyptian horoscopes that contain sufficient astronomical data, and claims they all fit into 11th to 19th century timeframe.{{clarify|date=June 2013}} Traditional history usually either interprets these horoscopes as belonging to the 1st century BC or suggests that they weren't meant to match any date at all.
* In his final analysis of an eclipse triad described by the ancient Greek [[Thucydides]] in ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', Fomenko dates the eclipses to AD 1039, 1046 and 1057. Because of the layered structure of the manuscript, he claims that Thucydides actually lived in medieval times and in describing the [[Peloponnesian War]] between the [[Sparta]]ns and [[Athens|Athenians]] he was actually describing the conflict between the medieval [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarrans]] and [[History of Catalonia|Catalans]] in Spain from AD 1374 to 1387.
* Fomenko claims that the abundance of dated astronomical records in cuneiform texts from Mesopotamia is of little use for dating of events, as the astronomical phenomena they describe recur cyclically every 30–40 years.

=== Rejection of common dating methods ===

On archaeological dating methods, Fomenko claims:

{{quote|Archaeological, dendrochronological, paleographical and carbon methods of dating of ancient sources and artifacts are both non-exact and contradictory, therefore there is not a single piece of firm written evidence or artifact that could be reliably and independently dated earlier than the XI century|Anatoly Fomenko|''History: Fiction or Science? (Chronology 1) [Second edition]''}}

[[Dendrochronology]] is rejected with a claim that, for dating of objects much older than the oldest still living trees, it isn't an absolute, but a [[relative dating]] method, and thus dependent on traditional chronology. Fomenko specifically points to a break of dendrochronological scales around AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. | authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko
 | script-title=ru:Новые эмпирико-статистические методики датирования древних событий и приложения к глобальной хронологии древнего и средневекового мира (краткая справка)

 | accessdate = 2006-09-09| language = Russian
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko also cites a number of cases where [[carbon dating]] of a series of objects of known age gave significantly different dates. He also alleges undue cooperation between physicists and archaeologists in obtaining the dates, since most radiocarbon dating labs only accept samples with an age estimate suggested by historians or archaeologists. Fomenko also claims that carbon dating over the range of AD 1 to 2000 is inaccurate because it has too many sources of error that are either guessed at or completely ignored, and that calibration is done with a statistically meaningless number of samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. | authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko

 | url = http://www.univer.omsk.su/foreign/fom/fom.txt | format = .txt
 | accessdate = 2006-09-09 | language = Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Consequently, Fomenko concludes that carbon dating is not accurate enough to be used on historical scale.

Fomenko rejects [[numismatics|numismatic]] dating as circular, being based on the traditional chronology, and points to cases of similar coins being minted in distant periods, unexplained long periods with no coins minted and cases of mismatch of numismatic dating with historical accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Reception==
Fomenko's historical ideas have been universally rejected by mainstream scholars, who brand them as [[pseudoscience]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Vitaly L. Ginzburg]], [http://humanism.al.ru/en/articles.phtml?num=000051 ''Pseudoscience and the Need to Combat It'']. Ginzburg is a [[Nobel laureate]] and a member of the Commission to Combat Pseudoscience and the Falsification of Scientific Research of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;/ref&gt; but were popularized by former world chess champion [[Garry Kasparov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new-tradition.org/view-garry-kasparov.htm Mathematics of the Past]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newc.narod.ru/article/nx/ksprv.htm Некоторые выступления Г. Каспарова по проблеме «Новой Хронологии»]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winter, Edward [http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/newchronology.html "Garry Kasparov and New Chronology"] ''Chess Notes''&lt;/ref&gt; Billington writes that the theory "might have quietly blown away in the wind tunnels of academia" if not for Kasparov's writing in support of it in the magazine ''[[Ogoniok]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Billington |first=James H. |title=Russia in Search of Itself |publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |year=2004 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kasparov met Fomenko during the 1990s, and found that Fomenko's conclusions concerning certain subjects were identical to his own regarding the popular view (which is not the view of academics) that [[Dark Ages (historiography)#Modern popular use|art and culture died during the Dark Ages]] and were not revived until the Renaissance. Kasparov also felt it illogical that the Romans and the Greeks living under the banner of [[Byzantium]] could fail to use the mounds of scientific knowledge left them by Ancient Greece and Rome, especially when it was of urgent military use. However, Kasparov does not support the reconstruction part of the New Chronology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kasparov.ru/material.php?id=44FE98F9E4576 "Answers of Kasparov"] (in Russian). Kasparov.ru ([[gazeta.ru]]). September 6, 2006. Retrieved 2009-12-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Russian critics tended to see Fomenko's New Chronology as "an embarrassment and a potent symbol of the depths to which the Russian academy and society have generally sunk ... since the fall of Communism".&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Western critics see his views as part of a renewed Russian imperial ideology, "keeping alive an imperial consciousness and secular messianism in Russia".&lt;ref name="Sheiko 2004 p. 13"&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dmitrii Sidorov, "Post-Imperial Third Romes: Resurrections of a Russian Orthodox Geopolitical Metaphor", ''Geopolitics'', 11 (2006):317–347, at pp. 336-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 at the Moscow International Book Fair, Anatoly Fomenko with his coauthor [[Gleb Vladimirovich Nosovsky|Gleb Nosovsky]] were awarded for their books on "New Chronology" the anti-prize called [[:ru:Антипремия «Абзац»|"Abzatz"]] (literally 'paragraph', a Russian slang word meaning 'disaster' or 'fiasco') in the category "Pochotnaya bezgramota" (the term is a pun upon "Pochotnaya gramota" ([[Russian Federation Presidential Certificate of Honour|Certificate of Honor]]) and may be translated either "Certificate of Dishonor" or literally, "Respectable Illiteracy" ) for the worst book published in Russia.

Critics have accused Fomenko of altering the data to improve the fit with his ideas and have noted that he [[Confirmation bias|violates a key rule of statistics]] by selecting matches from the historical record which support his chronology, while ignoring those which do not, creating artificial, better-than-chance correlations, and that these practices undermine Fomenko's statistical arguments.&lt;ref name="pedersen2002"/&gt; The new chronology was given a comprehensive critical analysis in a round table on "The 'Myths' of New Chronology" chaired by the dean of the department of history of [[Moscow State University]] in December 1999.&lt;ref&gt;V.L.

Billington, ''Russia in Search of Itself'', (Washington: Woodrow Wilson Center Press / Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press), 2004, pp. 83-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist [[Andrey Zaliznyak]] argued that by using the Fomenko's approaches one can "prove" any historical correspondence, for example, between Ancient Egyptian pharaohs and French kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/science/2011/12/02_a_3855010.shtml|script-title=ru:«Фоменко — жертва фанатизма»|last=Малянов|first=Дмитрий|date=2 December 2011|publisher=[[Gazeta.ru]]|language=Russian|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/fomenko/zaliznk.htm|script-title=ru:Лингвистика по А.

[[James H. Billington|James Billington]], formerly professor of Russian history at [[Harvard]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and the [[Librarian of Congress]] from 1987-2015 placed Fomenko's work within the context of the political movement of [[Eurasianism]], which sought to tie Russian history closely to that of its Asian neighbors. Billington describes Fomenko as ascribing the belief in past hostility between Russia and the Mongols to the influence of Western historians. Thus, by Fomenko's chronology, "Russia and Turkey are parts of a previously single empire."&lt;ref name="James H. Billington 2004, pp. 82-4"/&gt; A French reviewer of Billington's book noted approvingly his concern with the phantasmagorical conceptions of Fomenko about the global "new chronology".&lt;ref name="monderusse.revues.org" /&gt;

H.G. van Bueren, professor emeritus of astronomy at the [[University of Utrecht]], concluded his scathing review of Fomenko's work on the application of mathematics and astronomy to historical data as follows:
{{quote|text=It is surprising, to say the least, that a well-known (Dutch) publisher could produce an expensive book of such doubtful intellectual value, of which the only good word that can be said is that it contains an enormous amount of factual historical material, untidily ordered, true; badly written, yes; mixed-up with conjectural nonsense, sure; but still, much useful stuff. For the rest of the book is absolutely worthless. It reminds one of the early Soviet attempts to produce [[Pathological science|tendentious science]] ([[Lysenkoism|Lysenko]]!), of [[polywater]], of [[cold fusion]], and of modern [[creationism]]. In brief: a useless and misleading book.|sign=H.G. van Bueren|source="Mathematics and Logic"&lt;ref name="Bueren 1994"/&gt;}}

===Convergence of methods in archaeological dating===

While Fomenko rejects commonly accepted dating methods, archaeologists, conservators and other scientists make extensive use of such techniques which have been rigorously examined and refined during decades of use.&lt;ref&gt;See the international journal [http://www.radiocarbon.org/ ''Radiocarbon''] for examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the specific case of [[dendrochronology]], Fomenko claims that this fails as an absolute dating method because of gaps in the record. However, independent dendrochronological sequences beginning with living trees from various parts of [[North America]]&lt;ref&gt;C. W. Ferguson and D. A.

F., Orcel, C., Küppers, M. "The 12,460-year Hohenheim Oak and pine tree-ring chronology from central Europe: A unique annual record for radiocarbon calibration and paleoenvironment reconstructions" ''Radiocarbon'' 2004, vol. 46, no3, pp. 1111-1122 [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=16599079]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misuse of historical sources and forced pattern matching===

Critics of Fomenko's theory claim that his use of historical sources is highly selective and ignores the basic principles of sound historical scholarship.&lt;blockquote&gt;
Fomenko ... provides no fair-minded review of the historical literature about a topic with which he deals, quotes only those sources that serve his purposes, uses evidence in ways that seem strange to professionally-trained historians and asserts the wildest speculation as if it has the same status as the information common to the conventional historical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They also note that his method of statistically correlating of texts is very rough, because it does not take into account the many possible sources of variation in length outside of "importance". They maintain that differences in language, style, and scope, as well as the frequently differing views and focuses of historians, which are manifested in a different notion of "important events", make quantifying historical writings a dubious proposition at best. What's more, Fomenko's critics allege that the parallelisms he reports are often derived by alleged forcing by Fomenko of the data &amp;ndash; rearranging, merging, and removing monarchs as needed to fit the pattern.

For example, on the one hand Fomenko asserts that the vast majority of ancient sources are either irreparably distorted duplicate accounts of the same events or later forgeries. In his identification of [[Jesus]] with [[Pope Gregory VII]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fSvlaZYbcwUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;sig=2_vZeaAnuN5U6iITpdkuUK-eIlI#PPA51,M1 Book 2, Chapter 2, pg 51]&lt;/ref&gt; he ignores the otherwise vast dissimilarities between their reported lives and focuses on the similarity of their appointment to religious office by baptism. (The evangelical Jesus is traditionally believed to have lived for 33 years, and he was an adult at the time of his encounter with [[John the Baptist]]. In contrast, according to the available primary sources, Pope Gregory VII lived for at least 60 years and was born 8 years after the death of Fomenko's John-the-Baptist equivalent [[John Crescentius]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06791c.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope St. Gregory VII]&lt;/ref&gt;)

Critics allege that many of the supposed correlations of regnal durations are the product of the selective parsing and blending of the dates, events, and individuals mentioned in the original text.{{sfn|Colavito|2004}} Another point raised by critics is that Fomenko does not explain his altering the data (changing the order of rulers, dropping rulers, combining rulers, treating interregna as rulers, switching between theologians and emperors, etc.) preventing a duplication of the effort and effectively making this whole theory an [[ad hoc hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="pedersen2002"/&gt;

===Selectivity in reference to astronomical phenomena===

Critics point out that Fomenko's discussion of astronomical phenomena tends to be selective, choosing isolated examples that support the New Chronology and ignoring the large bodies of data that provide statistically supported evidence for the conventional dating. For his dating of the Almagest star catalog, Fomenko arbitrarily selected eight stars from the more than 1000 stars in the catalog, one of which (Arcturus) has a large systematic error. This star has a dominant effect on Fomenko's dating.&lt;ref&gt;Yu. N. Efremov, [http://www.hist.msu.ru/Science/DISKUS/FOMENKO/efremov.htm Астрономия и синдром “новой хронологии”] (Astronomy and the Syndrome of "New Chronology").&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical analysis using the same method for all "fast" stars points to the antiquity of the Almagest star catalog.&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Dambis and Yu. N. Efremov, "Dating Ptolemy's Star Catalogue through Proper Motions: The Hipparchan Epoch", [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000JHA....31..115D ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', 31 (2000): 115-134;] see especially note 17 (p. 134).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Gorodetsky, [http://www.newchrono.net/fomenko/starwars.htm Звездные войны с историей (верификация датировки Альмагеста)] (Starry wars with history (Verification of the dating of the Almagest)).&lt;/ref&gt; Rawlins points out further that Fomenko's statistical analysis got the wrong date for the ''Almagest'' because he took as constant Earth's [[axial tilt|obliquity]] when it is a variable that changes at a very slow, but known, rate.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Rawlins, "Recovering Hipparchos’ Last Lost Lustrous Star", [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w43.pdf ''DIO'' 4.3 (1994): 119]. Like Dambis and Efremov, Rawlins provides evidence that the Almagest star catalog was based on observations made in the 2nd century BCE by [[Hipparchus]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko's studies ignore the abundance of dated astronomical records in [[cuneiform]] texts from [[Mesopotamia]]. Among these texts is a series of [[Babylonian astronomical diaries]], which records precise astronomical observations of the Moon and planets, often dated in terms of the reigns of known historical figures extending back to the 6th century BCE. Astronomical retrocalculations for all these moving objects allow us to date these observations, and consequently the rulers' reigns, to within a single day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asger Aaboe]], ''Episodes from the Early History of Astronomy,'' (New York: Springer, 2001) pp. 39-40 {{ISBN|0-387-95136-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The observations are sufficiently redundant that only a small portion of them are sufficient to date a text to a unique year in the period 750 BCE to 100 CE. The dates obtained agree with the accepted chronology.&lt;ref&gt;F. R. Stephenson and J. M. Steele, "Astronomical Dating of Babylonian Texts Describing the Total Solar Eclipse of S.E. 175", ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', 37 (2006): 55-69. This study showed that either the description of the phenomena observed at the solar eclipse or of a set of conjunctions of the slow planets [[Saturn]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Mars]] were sufficient to equate [[Seleucid era|S.E.]] 175 with 137/6 BCE. Additional details in these texts provided further confirmation of this dating.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, F. R. Stephenson has demonstrated through a systematic study of a large number of [[Babylonia]]n, Ancient and Medieval European, and [[China|Chinese]] records of eclipse observations that they can be dated consistently with conventional chronology at least as far back as 600 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;F. Richard Stephenson, "Historical Eclipses and Earth's Rotation", [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/action/showPdf?submitPDF=Full+Text+PDF+%28243+KB%29&amp;doi=10.1046%2Fj.1468-4004.2003.44222.x ''Astronomy &amp; Geophysics''], 44 (2003): 2.22-2.27.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Fomenko's missing centuries, Stephenson's studies of eclipse observations find an accumulated uncertainty in the timing of the rotation of the earth of 420 seconds at 400 BCE, and only 80 seconds at 1000 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Espenak, [http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEhelp/rotation.html Eclipse Predictions and Earth's Rotation] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716020131/sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEhelp/rotation.html |date=2012-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnitude and consistency of conspiracy theory===
Fomenko states that world history prior to 1600 was deliberately falsified for political reasons. The consequences of this conspiracy theory are twofold. Documents that conflict with New Chronology are said to have been edited or fabricated by conspirators; the Vatican, the Holy Roman Empire and pro-German [[House of Romanov|Romanov dynasty]].&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; New Chronology taps traditionally Russian anti-Western thoughts and ideas of Germany as a chief enemy. Further, the theory is Russocentric diminishing achievements of other cultures and claiming major civilization accomplishments as Russian and by proposing a giant "Russian Horde" empire and eliminating historical time before its existence.&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; The theory also claimed to undermine nationalism in countries neighboring Russia by positioning divisions and conflicts as fabricated.&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; Unlike other popular conspiracy theories New Chronology is not [[anti-semitic]] ''per se'', but it contains claims that may be unwelcome by Jewish communities like that the [[Old Testament]] is newer than the [[New Testament]], placing Jerusalem in [[Constantinople]] and projecting stereotypes of [[Jew]]s by proposing that Jews originate from bankers in the Russian Horde that adopted the religion of Judaism, itself a derivative of Christianity and [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|not the other way round]].&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt; 

The theory provides an alternate history account of the "true" history centered around a world empire called the "Russian Horde".&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt; The scope of the New Chronology has been compared to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s fantasy world.&lt;ref name=Halperin2011&gt;{{cite journal |last= Halperin |first= Charles J. |year= 2011 |title= False Identity and Multiple Identities in Russian History: The Mongol Empire and Ivan the Terrible |url= http://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/160 |journal= The Carl Beck Papers |publisher= The Center for Russian and East European Studies|volume= |number= 2103 |pages= 1–71|doi= 10.5195/cbp.2011.160|access-date=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of pages has been written about it and authors address a wide range of objections.&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt;

===Popularity in forums and amongst Russian imperialists===

Fomenko has published and sold over one million copies of his books in his native [[Russia]]. Many [[Internet forum]]s have appeared which aim to supplement his work with additional amateur research.&lt;ref&gt;Melleuish et al. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His critics have suggested that Fomenko's version of history appealed to the Russian reading public by keeping alive an imperial consciousness to replace their disillusionment with the failures of Communism and [[Russian oligarchs|post-Communist corporate oligarchies]].&lt;ref name="Sheiko 2004 p. 13"/&gt;

{{For|the work by H. G. Wells|The Outline of History}}

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to history:

'''[[History]]''' – discovery, collection, organization, and presentation of information about past events. History can also mean the period of time after writing was invented (the beginning of  [[recorded history]]).


== Nature of history ==
History can be described as all of the following:
* [[Academic discipline]] – body of knowledge given to – or received by – a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialise in.
** one of the [[humanities]] – academic discipline that study the human condition, using methods that are primarily analytical, critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences.
* [[Fields of science|Field of science]]  – widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature.  Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published.  There are many sociology-related scientific journals.
** [[Social science]]  – field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society.

===Essence of history===
* [[Chronology]] &amp;ndash; science of arranging events in their order of occurrence in time, such as in [[historical timeline]]s.
* [[Past]] &amp;ndash; totality of events which occurred before a given point in time. The past is contrasted with and defined by the present and the future. The concept of the past is derived from the linear fashion in which human observers experience time, and is accessed through memory and recollection. The past is the domain of history.
* [[Time]] &amp;ndash; measure in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future, and also the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them. Time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions. History describes what happened where, but also when (in time) those events took place.

== Historical disciplines ==
* [[Archaeology]] – study of past human cultures through the recovery, documentation and analysis of material remains and environmental data
* [[Archontology]] – study of historical offices and important positions in state, international, political, religious and other organizations and societies
* [[Art history]] – study of changes in and social context of art
* [[Chronology]] – locating events in time
* [[Cultural history]] – study of culture in the past
* [[Diplomatic history]] – study of the historical foreign policy and diplomacy of states 
* [[History of science]] – study of the emergence and development of scientific inquiry
* [[Economic history]] – the study of economics in the past
* [[Environmental history]] – study of natural history and the human relationship with the natural world
* [[Futurology]] – study of the future: researches the medium to long-term future of societies and of the physical world
* [[Historiography]] &amp;ndash; both the study of the methodology of historians and development of history as a discipline, and also to a body of historical work on a particular subject. The historiography of a specific topic covers how historians have studied that topic using particular sources, techniques, and theoretical approaches.
* [[Intellectual history]]
* [[History painter|History painting]] – painting of works of art having historical motifs or depicting great events
* [[Military history]] – study of warfare and wars in history
* [[Naval history]] – branch of military history devoted to warfare at sea or in bodies of water
* [[Paleography]] – study of ancient texts
* [[Philosophy of history]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Political history]] – study of past political events, ideas, movements, and leaders
* [[Public history]] – presentation of history to public audiences and other areas typically outside academia
* [[Psychohistory]] – study of the psychological motivations of historical events
* [[Social history]] – study of societies and social trends in the past
* [[Universal history]] – study of trends and dynamics in world history
* [[Urban history]] – historical nature of cities and towns, and the process of urbanization
* [[Women's history]] – study of the roles of women throughout history 
* [[World history]] – study of global or transnational historical patterns

In his first book, ''The Island of Seven Cities: Where the Chinese Settled When They Discovered America'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Island of Seven Cities:  Where the Chinese Settled When They Discovered North America|last=Chiasson|first=Paul|publisher=Random House|year=2006|isbn=978-0-679-31455-4|location=Toronto|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiasson explains his belief that Chinese voyagers settled in the [[Cape Dauphin]] area of [[Nova Scotia]] almost a century before the voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]]. He suggests that the indigenous [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] culture was influenced by these people in the form of possible archaeological remains, customs, costumes, art and even written language.

His theory has been rejected by mainstream historians.&lt;ref name=invented/&gt; Provincial archaeologists and a geologist have said that some of Chiasson's physical evidence of a Chinese settlement—a road up the side of [[Cape Dauphin]] and the stone remains of a wall surrounding the site —were actually built in 1952 by a volunteer fire company fighting a forest fire and again in the 1990s by a gravel company attempting to dig gravel on the cape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/no-chinese-ruins-in-cape-breton-archeologists-1.619486|title=No Chinese ruins in Cape Breton: archeologists |date=July 27, 2006 |work=CBC News |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chiasson challenges these statements in his second book, ''Written in the Ruins: Cape Breton Island's Second Pre-Columbian Chinese Settlement.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Written in the Ruins: Cape Breton Island's Second Pre-Columbian Chinese Settlement|last=Chiasson|first=Paul|publisher=Dundurn|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4597-3312-1|location=Toronto|pages=16–17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, several years after the reports of the [[Nova Scotian]] archeologists, [[History Television]] aired a one-hour documentary entitled "Mysterious Ruins: Cape Breton".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=231247 |title=Mysterious Ruins: Cape Breton |date=December 11, 2010 |work=History Television }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The documentary explored Chiasson's theory and included interviews with an archeologist and a geologist from the area who viewed the site that Chiasson posits was the location of a pre-Columbian Chinese community. Geologist Sandra Barr of [[Acadia University]] and archaeologist Steve Davis of [[St. Mary's University (Halifax)|St. Mary's University]] stated that they found no evidence of any human settlement on the site. Acadia University reported that "their explanations are mostly ignored in the film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese Ruins in Cape Breton?|url=http://science.acadiau.ca/news-reader.2881/chinese-ruins-in-cape-breton.html|publisher=Acada University|accessdate=1 October 2016|date=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The documentary also included interviews with several Chinese architectural historians.&lt;ref name="O'Connor"&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Connor|first1=Joe|title=Cape Breton’s Great Wall: Chinese found East coast in 1500s, author says|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/cape-bretons-great-wall-chinese-found-east-coast-in-1500s-author-says|accessdate=1 October 2016|publisher=National Post|date=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Zhu Guangya, Professor of Architectural History at Southeast University, Nanjing stated (translation), "I believe the site is a ruin from a human settlement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12212">The '''phantom time hypothesis''' is a historical [[conspiracy theory]] asserted by Heribert Illig. First published in 1991, it hypothesizes a conspiracy by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto III]], [[Pope Sylvester II]], and possibly the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine VII]], to fabricate the [[Anno Domini]] dating system retrospectively, in order to place them at the special year of AD 1000, and to rewrite history&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Ulrich Niemitz, [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/volatile/Niemitz-1997.pdf ''Did the Early Middle Ages Really Exist?''] pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; to legitimize Otto's claim to the Holy Roman Empire. Illig believed that this was achieved through the alteration, misrepresentation and forgery of documentary and physical evidence.&lt;ref name="fomenko1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly | year = 2007 | publisher = Mithec | isbn = 2-913621-07-4 | title = History: Chronology 1: Second Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this scenario, the entire [[Carolingian period]], including the figure of [[Charlemagne]], is a fabrication, with a "phantom time" of 297 years (AD 614–911) added to the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The proposal has been universally rejected by mainstream historians.

== Heribert Illig ==
Illig was born in 1947 in [[Vohenstrauß]], [[Bavaria]].
He was active in an association dedicated to [[Immanuel Velikovsky]], [[catastrophism]] and [[historical revisionism]],
''Gesellschaft zur Rekonstruktion der Menschheits- und Naturgeschichte''.
From 1989 to 1994 he acted as editor of the journal ''Vorzeit-Frühzeit-Gegenwart''.
Since 1995, he has worked as a publisher and author under his own publishing company, ''Mantis-Verlag'', and publishing his own journal, ''Zeitensprünge''.
Outside of his publications related to revised chronology, he has edited the works of [[Egon Friedell]].

Before focusing on the early medieval period, Illig published various proposals for revised chronologies of prehistory and of Ancient Egypt.
His proposals received prominent coverage in German popular media in the 1990s. His 1996 ''Das erfundene Mittelalter'' also received scholarly recensions, but was universally rejected as fundamentally flawed by historians.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Fried: ''Wissenschaft und Phantasie. Das Beispiel der Geschichte'', in: Historische Zeitschrift Band 263,2/1996, 291–316.
Matthias Grässlin, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 1. Oktober 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1997, the journal ''Ethik und Sozialwissenschaften'' offered a platform for critical discussion to Illig's proposal, with a number of historians commenting on its various aspects.&lt;ref&gt;EuS 1997 Heft 4.
Theo Kölzer (Bonn University) refused to contribute, and the journal printed his letter of refusal instead in which Kölzer criticizes the journal for lending credibility to Illig's "abstruse" idea.
A favourable review was published by sociologist Gunnar Heinsohn, which later led to a collaboration between Illig and Heinsohn until 2011, when Heinsohn left the board of editors of Illig's journal and published his rejection of Illig's core idea that the figure of Charlemagne is a high medieval fiction.&lt;/ref&gt;
After 1997, there has been little scholarly reception of Illig's ideas, although they continued to be discussed as [[pseudohistory]] in German popular media.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Borgolte]]. In: [[Der Tagesspiegel]] vom 29. Juni 1999. Stephan Matthiesen: ''[http://www.stephan-matthiesen.de/de/texte/archaeologie-geschichte/erfundenes-mittelalter-illig.html Erfundenes Mittelalter – fruchtlose These!]'', in: Skeptiker 2/2001&lt;/ref&gt;
Illig continued to publish on the "phantom time hypothesis" until at least 2013.
Also in 2013, he published on an unrelated topic of [[art history]], on [[German Renaissance]] master [[Anton Pilgram]], but again proposing revisions to conventional chronology, and arguing for the abolition of the art historical category of [[Mannerism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Meister Anton, gen. Pilgram, oder Abschied vom Manierismus'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposal ==
The bases of Illig's hypothesis include:&lt;ref name="Illig 1"&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Heribert | last = Illig
 | title = Wer hat an der Uhr gedreht? |isbn=3-548-75064-8 | publisher = Econ Verlag | year = 2000
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Illig 2"&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Heribert | last = Illig
 | title = Das erfundene Mittelalter |isbn=3-548-36429-2 | publisher = | year =
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The scarcity of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] evidence that can be reliably dated to the period AD 614–911, the perceived inadequacies of radiometric and [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] methods of dating this period, and the over-reliance of medieval historians on written sources.
* The presence of [[Romanesque architecture]] in tenth-century Western Europe, suggesting the Roman era was not as long ago as conventionally thought.
* The relation between the [[Julian calendar]], [[Gregorian calendar]] and the underlying astronomical [[tropical year|solar or tropical year]]. The Julian calendar, introduced by [[Julius Caesar]], was long known to introduce a discrepancy from the tropical year of around one day for each century that the calendar was in use. By the time the Gregorian calendar was introduced in AD 1582, Illig alleges that the old Julian calendar should have produced a discrepancy of thirteen days between it and the real (or tropical) calendar. Instead, the astronomers and mathematicians working for [[Pope Gregory XIII]] had found that the civil calendar needed to be adjusted by only ten days. (The Julian calendar day Thursday, 4 October 1582 was followed by the first day of the Gregorian calendar, Friday, 15 October 1582). From this, Illig concludes that the [[Anno Domini|AD]] era had counted roughly three centuries which never existed.

== Criticism ==
* The most difficult challenge to the theory is through observations in [[Archaeoastronomy|ancient astronomy]], especially those of [[solar eclipse]]s cited by European sources prior to 600 AD (when phantom time would have distorted the chronology). Besides several others that are perhaps too vague to disprove the phantom time hypothesis, two in particular are dated with enough precision to disprove the hypothesis with a high degree of certainty. One is reported by [[Pliny the Elder]] in 59 AD&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder. [http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm#BOOK%20II ''Natural History'' (Book II)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101063545/http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm |date=2017-01-01 }}, accessed 14 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and one by [[Photius]] in 418 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Photius. [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/philostorgius.htm ''Epitome of the Church History of Philosturgius''], accessed 4 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these dates and times have confirmed [[Lists of solar eclipses|eclipses]]. In addition, observations during the [[Tang dynasty]] in China, and [[Halley's Comet]], for example, are consistent with current astronomy with no "phantom time" added.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|surname1=Dieter Herrmann|periodical=Beiträge zur Astronomiegeschichte&amp;nbsp;3|title=Nochmals: Gab es eine Phantomzeit in unserer Geschichte? |year=2000|at=pp.&amp;nbsp;211–14|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dutch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dutch|first=Stephen|title=Is a Chunk of History Missing?|url=http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/PSEUDOSC/Phantom%20Time.HTM|accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Archaeological remains and dating methods such as [[dendrochronology]] refute, rather than support, "phantom time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Amalie |last=Fößel |title=Karl der Fiktive? |work=[[Damals]], Magazin für Geschichte und Kultur |issue=8 |year=1999 |pages=20f }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Gregorian reform was never purported to bring the calendar in line with the Julian calendar as it had existed at the time of its institution in 45 BC, but as it had existed in 325, the time of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], which had established a method for [[Computus|determining the date]] of [[Easter Sunday]] by fixing the [[vernal equinox]] on March 21 in the Julian calendar. By 1582, the astronomical equinox was occurring on March 10 in the Julian calendar, but Easter was still being calculated from a nominal equinox on March 21. In 45 BC the astronomical vernal equinox took place around March 23. Illig's "three missing centuries" thus correspond to the 369 years between the institution of the Julian calendar in 45 BC, and the fixing of the Easter Date at the Council of Nicaea in AD 325.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Mütz: ''Die „Phantomzeit“ 614 bis 911 von Heribert Illig. Kalendertechnische und kalenderhistorische Einwände.'' In: ''Zeitschrift für Württembergische Landesgeschichte.'' Band 60, 2001, S. 11–23.&lt;/ref&gt;
* If [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Carolingian dynasty]] were fabricated, there would have to be a corresponding fabrication of the history of the rest of Europe, including [[Anglo-Saxon England]], the [[History of the papacy|Papacy]], and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The "phantom time" period also encompasses the life of [[Muhammad]] and the [[Early Muslim conquests|Islamic expansion]] into the areas of the former Roman Empire, including the conquest of [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic Iberia]]. This history too would have to be forged or drastically misdated. It would also have to be reconciled with the history of the [[Tang dynasty]] of China and its contact with Islam, such as at the [[Battle of Talas]].&lt;ref name="Dutch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Cecil|title=Did the Middle Ages Not Really Happen?|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2992/did-the-middle-ages-not-really-happen|accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact''' theories relate to visits or interactions with the [[Americas]] and/or [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] by  people from [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]], or [[Oceania]] before [[Columbus's first voyage]] to the [[Caribbean]] in 1492.&lt;ref name="RileyKelley2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carroll L.

Two historical cases of pre-Columbian contact are accepted amongst the scientific and scholarly mainstream.

The scientific and scholarly responses to other post-[[prehistory]], pre-Columbian contact claims have varied. Some such contact claims are examined in reputable peer-reviewed sources. Other contact claims, typically based on circumstantial and ambiguous interpretations of archaeological finds, cultural comparisons, comments in historical documents, and narrative accounts, have been dismissed as [[fringe science]] or [[pseudoarcheology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alice Beck Kehoe]] (2003)[http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_17_1_kehoe.pdf The Fringe of American Archaeology: Transoceanic and Transcontinental Contacts in Prehistoric America].

[[Vikings |Norse]] journeys to Greenland and Canada are supported by historical and archaeological evidence. A Norse colony in [[Greenland]] was established in the late 10th century, and lasted until the mid 15th century, with court and parliament assemblies (''[[Thing (assembly)|þing]]'') taking place at [[Brattahlíð]] and a bishop at [[Gardar, Greenland|Garðar]].&lt;ref name="WurmMühlhäusler1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=S.

Few sources describing contact between [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] and Norse people exist. Contact between the [[Thule people]] (ancestors of the modern [[Inuit]]) and Norse between the 12th or 13th centuries is known. The Norse Greenlanders called these incoming settlers "[[skræling]]ar". Conflict between the Greenlanders and the "skrælings" is recorded in the ''[[Icelandic Annals]]''. The term skrælings is also used in the Vínland sagas, which relate to events during the 10th century, when describing trade and conflict with native peoples.&lt;ref name="Seaver2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kirsten A.

== Claims of Polynesian contact ==

=== Claims involving sweet potato ===
The [[sweet potato]], which is native to the Americas, was widespread in [[Polynesia]] when Europeans first reached the Pacific. Sweet potato has been radiocarbon-dated in the [[Cook Islands]] to 1000 CE, and current thinking is that it was brought to central Polynesia c. 700 CE and spread across [[Polynesia]] from there.&lt;ref&gt;Van Tilburg, Jo Anne. 1994. Easter Island: Archaeology, Ecology and Culture. Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Langdon | first1 = Robert | year = 2001 | title = The Bamboo Raft as a Key to the Introduction of the Sweet Potato in Prehistoric Polynesia | url = | journal = The Journal of Pacific History | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 51–76| doi=10.1080/00223340123312}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it was brought by Polynesians who had traveled to South America and back, or that South Americans brought it to the Pacific. It is possible that the plant could successfully float across the ocean if discarded from the cargo of a boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440307000805|title=Modeling the prehistoric arrival of the sweet potato in Polynesia | doi=10.1016/j.jas.2007.04.004 | volume=35|issue=2 |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|pages=355–367|year=2008 |last1=Montenegro |first1=Álvaro |last2=Avis |first2=Chris |last3=Weaver |first3=Andrew }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phylogenetic]] analysis supports the hypothesis of at least two separate introductions of sweet potatoes from South America into Polynesia, including one before and one after European contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Roullier, Caroline|title=Historical collections reveal patterns of diffusion of sweet potato in Oceania obscured by modern plant movements and recombination|work=PNAS|volume=110|issue=6|date=January 22, 2013|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/6/2205 |display-authors=etal|doi=10.1073/pnas.1211049110|pmid=23341603|pages=2205–2210|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.2205R|pmc=3568323}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[#Linguistics]].)

=== Claims involving Peruvian mummies ===
A team of academics headed by the [[University of York]]'s Mummy Research Group and BioArch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.york.ac.uk/admin/presspr/magazine/aprilmag08.pdf |title=28801_April08.indd |publisher=York.ac.uk |date=December 2, 2010 |accessdate=February 3, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; while examining a Peruvian mummy at the [[Bolton Museum]], found that it had been embalmed using a tree [[resin]].  Before this it was thought that Peruvian mummies were naturally preserved. The resin, found to be that of an ''[[Araucaria]]'' [[Pinophyta|conifer]] related to the [[Araucaria araucana|'monkey puzzle tree']], was from a variety found only in [[Oceania]] and probably [[New Guinea]]. "Radiocarbon dating of both the resin and body by the University of Oxford's radiocarbon laboratory confirmed they were essentially contemporary, and date to around CE 1200."&lt;ref&gt;From the University of York Magazine, page 9, April/May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Claims involving California canoes ===
[[File:Chumash Tomol 'Elye'wun paddlers, CINMS.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''‘Elye’wun'', a reconstructed Chumash [[tomol]]]]
Researchers including Kathryn Klar and Terry Jones have proposed a theory of contact between Hawaiians and the [[Chumash people]] of [[Southern California]] between 400 and 800 CE. The sewn-plank canoes crafted by the Chumash and neighboring [[Tongva people|Tongva]] are unique among the indigenous peoples of North America, but similar in design to larger canoes used by Polynesians for deep-sea voyages. ''[[Tomol|Tomolo'o]]'', the [[Chumash language|Chumash]] word for such a craft, may derive from ''kumula'au'', the Hawaiian term for the logs from which shipwrights carve planks to be sewn into canoes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/06/20/MNG9GDBBLG1.DTL Did ancient Polynesians visit California?

If it occurred, this contact left no genetic legacy in California or Hawaii. This theory has attracted limited media attention within California, but most archaeologists of the Tongva and Chumash cultures reject it on the grounds that the independent development of the sewn-plank canoe over several centuries is well-represented in the material record.&lt;ref&gt;For the argument against the Chumash—Polynesian contact theory, see {{cite journal | last1 = Arnold | first1 = J.E. | year = 2007 | title = Credit Where Credit is Due: The History of the Chumash Oceangoing Plank Canoe | url = | journal = American Antiquity | volume = 72 | issue = 2| pages = 196–209 | doi=10.2307/40035811| jstor = 40035811 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Jeanne E.

=== Claims involving chickens ===
The existence of chicken bones dating from 1321 to 1407 in Chile and thought to be genetically linked to South Pacific Island chicken landraces suggested further evidence of South Pacific contact with South America. The genetic link between the South American [[Mapuche]] (to whom the chickens were thought to originally belong)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/0801/topten/chicken.html|title=Top 10 Discoveries of 2007 – Polynesian Chickens in Chile – Archaeology Magazine Archive|work=archaeology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; chicken bones and South Pacific Island species has been rejected by a more recent genetic study which concluded that "The analysis of ancient and modern specimens reveals a unique Polynesian genetic signature" and that "a previously reported connection between pre-European South America and Polynesian chickens most likely resulted from contamination with modern DNA, and that this issue is likely to confound ancient DNA studies involving haplogroup E chicken sequences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=Vicki A|first2=Ophélie |last2=Lebrasseur |first3=Jeremy J. |last3=Austin |first4=Terry L. |last4=Hunt |first5=David A. |last5=Burney |first6=Tim |last6=Denham |first7=Nicolas J. |last7=Rawlence |first8=Jamie R. |last8=Wood |first9=Jaime |last9=Gongor |first10=Linus Girdland |last10=Flink |first11=Anna |last11=Linderholm |first12=Keith |last12=Dobney |first13=Greger |last13=Larson |first14=Alan |last14=Cooper|title=Using ancient DNA to study the origins and dispersal of ancestral Polynesian chickens across the Pacific|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=April 1, 2014|volume=111|issue=13|pages=4826–4831|doi=10.1073/pnas.1320412111|pmid=24639505|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/13/4826.full |pmc=3977275|bibcode=2014PNAS..111.4826T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years{{when?|date=August 2018}}, evidence has emerged suggesting a possibility of pre-Columbian contact between the [[Mapuche|Mapuche people]] (Araucanians) of south-central [[Chile]] and Polynesians. Chicken bones found at the site [[El Arenal, Chile|El Arenal]] in the [[Araucanía (historic region)|Arauco Peninsula]], an area inhabited by Mapuche, support a pre-Columbian introduction of [[Araucana chicken|chicken]] to South America.&lt;ref&gt;Storey et al., p. 10335.&lt;/ref&gt; The bones found in Chile were radiocarbon-dated to between 1304 and 1424, before the arrival of the Spanish.

=== Linguistics ===
[[File:Thames Kumara n.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sweet potatoes for sale, Thames, New Zealand. The name "kumara" has entered [[New Zealand English]] from [[Māori language|Māori]], and is in wide use.]]

Dutch linguists and specialists in [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Amerindian languages]] [[Willem Adelaar]] and Pieter Muysken have suggested that two lexical items may be shared by Polynesian languages and languages of South America. One is the name of the [[#Claims involving sweet potato|sweet potato]], which was domesticated in the New World. [[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]] *''kumala''&lt;ref name=POLLEX-kumala&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenhill|first1=Simon J.|last2=Clark|first2=Ross|last3=Biggs|first3=Bruce|title=Entries for KUMALA.1 [LO] Sweet Potato (Ipomoea)|url=http://pollex.org.nz/entry/kumala1/|work=POLLEX-Online: The Polynesian Lexicon Project Online|accessdate=July 16, 2013|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (compare [[Rapa Nui language|Easter Island]] ''kumara'', [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] ''ʻuala'',&lt;!--this is correct. an [m] was not dropped.--&gt; [[Māori language|Māori]] ''kumāra''; apparent [[cognate]]s outside [[Eastern Polynesian languages|Eastern Polynesian]] may be [[Loanword|borrowed]] from Eastern Polynesian languages, calling Proto-Polynesian status and age into question) may be connected with [[Quechua language|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language|Aymara]] ''k’umar ~ k’umara''. A possible second is the word for 'stone axe', Easter Island ''toki'', New Zealand Maori ''toki'' 'adze', [[Mapuche language|Mapuche]] ''toki'', and further afield, [[Yurumanguí language|Yurumanguí]] ''totoki'' 'axe'. According to Adelaar and Muysken, the similarity in the word for sweet potato "constitutes near proof of incidental contact between inhabitants of the Andean region and the South Pacific", though according to Adelaar and Muysken the word for axe is not as convincing. The authors argue that the presence of the word for sweet potato suggests sporadic contact between Polynesia and South America, but no migrations.&lt;ref&gt;"Genetic relations of South American Indian languages".

=== Similarity of features and genetics ===
[[File:Isla Mocha 1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mocha Island]] off the coast of [[Arauco Peninsula]], Chile]]
In December 2007, several human skulls  were found  in a museum in [[Concepción, Chile]].  These skulls  originated from [[Mocha Island]], an island just off the coast of Chile in the Pacific Ocean, formerly inhabited by the Mapuche. [[craniometry|Craniometric]] analysis of the skulls, according to [[Lisa Matisoo-Smith]] of the [[University of Otago]] and [[José Miguel Ramírez Aliaga]] of the [[Universidad de Valparaíso]], suggests that the skulls have "[[Polynesian people|Polynesian]] features" – such as a pentagonal shape when viewed from behind, and rocker jaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Lawler |first1= Andrew |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5984/1344.full |title=Beyond ''Kon-Tiki'': Did Polynesians Sail to South America?|journal=Science|date= June 11, 2010 |pages= 1344–1347 | pmid=20538927 | doi=10.1126/science.328.5984.1344 | volume=328 | issue=5984 |bibcode= 2010Sci...328.1344L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2007 to 2009, geneticist [[Erik Thorsby]] and colleagues have published two studies in  ''[[Tissue Antigens]]'' that evidence an Amerindian genetic contribution to the Easter Island population, determining that it was probably introduced before European discovery of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0039.2006.00717.x |title= Molecular genetic studies of natives on Easter Island: evidence of an early European and Amerindian contribution to the Polynesian gene pool | year = 2007 | last1 = Lie | first1 = B.

In 2014, geneticist Anna-Sapfo Malaspinas of The Center for GeoGenetics at the University of Copenhagen published a study in ''[[Current Biology]]'' that found human genetic evidence of contact between the populations of [[Easter Island]] and South America, approximately 600 years ago (i.e. 1400 CE ± 100 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Westerholm|first1=Russell|title=Easter Island Was Not Populated Solely by the Polynesians, According to New Genetic Study|url=http://www.universityherald.com/articles/12415/20141024/easter-island-was-not-populated-solely-by-the-polynesians-according-to-new-genetic-study.htm|website=University Herald|accessdate=2014-12-24|date=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of the now extinct [[Aimoré people|Botocudo people]], who lived in the interior of Brazil, were found in research published in 2013 to have been members of [[mtDNA haplogroup]] [[Haplogroup B (mtDNA)#Tree|B4a1a1]], which is normally found only among Polynesians and other subgroups of [[Austronesian people|Austronesians]]. This was based on an analysis of fourteen skulls. Two belonged to B4a1a1 (while twelve belonged to subclades of mtDNA  [[haplogroup C (mtDNA)|Haplogroup C1]] common among Native Americans). The research team examined various scenarios, none of which they could say for certain were correct. They dismissed a scenario of direct contact in prehistory between Polynesia and Brazil as "too unlikely to be seriously entertained." While B4a1a1 is also found among the [[Malagasy people]] of [[Madagascar]] (which experienced significant Austronesian settlement in prehistory), the authors described as "fanciful" suggestions that B4a1a1 among the Botocudo resulted from  the African slave trade (which included Madagascar).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Vanessa Faria Gonçalves |author2=Jesper Stenderup |author3=Cláudia Rodrigues-Carvalho |author4=Hilton P.

Norbeck, eds., Chicago: University of Chicago, pp. 489—510.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Other researchers have argued that the [[Olmec]] civilization came into existence with the help of [[China|Chinese]] refugees, particularly at the end of the [[Shang dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;This theory is mentioned in the history book [[The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community]] (1963) by [[William Hardy McNeill|William H. McNeill]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, [[Betty Meggers]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] argued that the Olmec civilization originated due to Shang Chinese influences around 1200 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Meggers.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1996 book, Mike Xu, with the aid of Chen Hanping, claimed that [[celt (tool)|celts]] from [[La Venta]] bear Chinese characters.&lt;ref&gt;Xu, ''Origin of the Olmec civilization''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinese.tcu.edu/www_chinese3_tcu_edu.htm Dr. Mike Xu's Transpacific website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010802024552/http://www.chinese.tcu.edu/www_chinese3_tcu_edu.htm |date=August 2, 2001 }}, comparing Olmec and Chinese Shang period artifacts.&lt;/ref&gt;  These claims are unsupported by mainstream Mesoamerican researchers.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Other claims have been made for early Chinese contact with North America.

In 1882 artifacts identified at the time as Chinese coins were discovered in British Columbia. A contemporary account states that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dean|first=James|journal=[[The American Naturalist]]|date=January 1884|pages=98–99|volume=18|issue=1|jstor=2450831|doi=10.1086/273578|title=Anthropology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In the summer of 1882 a miner found on De Foe (Deorse?) creek, Cassiar district, Br. Columbia, thirty Chinese coins in the auriferous sand, twenty-five feet below the surface. They appeared to have been strung, but on taking them up the miner let them drop apart. The earth above and around them was as compact as any in the neighborhood. One of these coins I examined at the store of Chu Chong in Victoria. Neither in metal nor markings did it resemble the modern coins, but in its figures looked more like an Aztec calendar. So far as I can make out the markings, this is a Chinese chronological cycle of sixty years, invented by [[Yellow Emperor|Emperor Huungti]], 2637 BCE, and circulated in this form to make his people remember it.&lt;/blockquote&gt; In 1885, a vase containing similar discs was also discovered, wrapped in the roots of a tree around 300 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chow|first=Lily|title=Chasing their dreams : Chinese settlement in the Northwest region of British Columbia = Zhui qun meng xiang|year=2000|publisher=Caitlin Press|location=Prince George, B.C.|isbn=978-0-920576-83-0|chapter=The Gold Fever|chapterurl=http://caitlin-press.com/our-books/chasing-their-dreams/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grant Keddie, Curator of Archeology at the Royal BC Museum, examined a photograph of a coin from Cassiar taken in the 1940s (whereabouts now unknown) and he believes that the character style and the evidence that it was machine-ground show it to be a 19th-century copy of a [[Ming Dynasty]] temple token.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Western Washington Indian socio-economics: papers in honor of Angelo Anastasio|year=1984|publisher=Western Washington University|page=172|author=Megan Merry McCormick|editor=Herbert C Taylor and Garland F Grabert|chapter=Chinese Coins and Pre-Columbian Asian Contacts with the Pacific Northwest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 and 1975 doughnut-shaped stones were discovered off the coast of California that resembled stone anchors used by Chinese fishermen. These (sometimes called the ''Palos Verdes stones'') were initially thought to be up to 1500 years old and proof of pre-Columbian contact by Chinese sailors. Later geological investigations showed them to be a local rock known as [[Monterey Formation|Monterey shale]], and they are thought to have been used by Chinese settlers fishing off the coast in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth L.

In June 2016, [[Purdue University]] published the results of research on six metal and composite metal artifacts excavated from a late prehistoric archaeological context at [[Cape Espenberg]] on the northern coast of the [[Seward Peninsula]] in [[Alaska]]. Also part of the research team was [[Robert J. Speakman]], of the Center for Applied Isotope Studies at the [[University of Georgia]], and [[Victor Mair]], of East Asian Languages and Civilizations at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. The report is the first evidence that metal from Asia reached prehistoric North America before the contact with Europeans, stating that [[X-ray fluorescence]] identified two of these artifacts as smelted industrial alloys with large proportions of tin and lead. The presence of smelted alloys in a prehistoric Inuit context in northwest Alaska was  demonstrated  for the first time and indicates the movement of Eurasian metal across the Bering Strait into North America before sustained contact with Europeans.
{{bquote|This is not a surprise based on oral history and other archaeological finds, and it was just a matter of time before we had a good example of Eurasian metal that had been traded [...] We believe these smelted alloys were made somewhere in Eurasia and traded to Siberia and then traded across the Bering Strait to ancestral {{sic|Inuits}} people, also known as Thule culture, in Alaska. Locally available metal in parts of the Arctic, such as native metal, copper and meteoritic and telluric iron were used by ancient Inuit people for tools and to sometimes indicate status. Two of the Cape Espenberg items that were found – a bead and a buckle — are heavily leaded bronze artifacts. Both are from a house at the site dating to the Late Prehistoric Period, around 1100-1300 AD, which is before sustained European contact in the late 18th century. [...] The belt buckle also is considered an industrial product and is an unprecedented find for this time. It resembles a buckle used as part of a horse harness that would have been used in north-central China during the first six centuries before the Common Era.|author=H.

=== Claims of Japanese contact ===
[[Image:Otokichi.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Otokichi]], a Japanese castaway in America in 1834, depicted here in 1849.]]
Smithsonian archaeologist [[Betty Meggers]] wrote that pottery associated with the [[Valdivia culture]] of coastal Ecuador dated to 3000–1500 BCE exhibited similarities to pottery produced during the [[Jōmon period]] in [[Japan]], arguing that contact between the two cultures might explain the similarities. Chronological and other problems have led most archaeologists to dismiss this idea as implausible.&lt;ref&gt;Valdivia, Jomon Fishermen, and the Nature of the North Pacific: Some Nautical Problems with Meggers, Evans, and Estrada's (1965) Transoceanic Contact Thesis Gordon F. McEwan, D. Bruce Dickson American Antiquity, Vol. 43, No. 3 (Jul. 1978), pp. 362–371.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Prehistory of the Americas'' By Stuart J. Fiedel pp 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion has been made that the resemblances (which are not complete) are simply due to the limited number of designs possible when incising clay.

Alaskan anthropologist Nancy Yaw Davis claims that the [[Zuni people]] of [[New Mexico]] exhibit linguistic and cultural similarities to the Japanese.&lt;ref name="Zuni"&gt;Davis, Nancy Yaw (200). ''The Zuni Enigma''. W. W. Norton &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0-393-32230-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-393-32230-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zuni language]] is a [[language isolate|linguistic isolate]], and Davis contends that the culture appears to differ from that of the surrounding natives in terms of blood type, [[endemic disease]], and religion. Davis speculates that [[Buddhist]] priests or restless peasants from Japan may have crossed the Pacific in the 13th century, traveled to the [[American Southwest]], and influenced Zuni society.&lt;ref name="Zuni" /&gt;

In the 1890s, lawyer and politician [[James Wickersham]]&lt;ref&gt;Wickersham, James (1892). "Origin of the Indians--The Polynesian Route." ''American Antiquarian'', 16:323-335, partly reprinted in [[William R. Corliss]], ed. (1978) ''Ancient Man: A Handbook of Puzzling Artifacts'', Glen Arm, Maryland: Sourcebook Project, {{ISBN|0-915554-03-8}} pp. 705-709&lt;/ref&gt; argued that pre-Columbian contact between Japanese sailors and Native Americans was highly probable, given that from the early 17th century to the mid-19th century several dozen Japanese ships were carried from Asia to North America along the powerful [[Kuroshio Current]]s. Such Japanese ships landed from the [[Aleutian Islands]] in the north to [[Mexico]] in the south, carrying a total of 293 persons in the 23 cases where head-counts were given in historical records. In most cases, the Japanese sailors gradually made their way home on merchant vessels. In 1834 a dismasted, rudderless Japanese ship crashed near [[Cape Flattery]]. Three survivors of the ship were enslaved by [[Makah people|Makahs]] for a period before being rescued by members of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. They were never able to return to their homeland due to Japan's isolationist policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/File/9065|title=Japanese Castaways of 1834: The Three Kichis - HistoryLink.org|website=www.historylink.org|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kuow.org/post/japanese-retrace-path-history-making-castaways-180-years-later|title=Japanese Retrace Path Of History-Making Castaways, 180 Years Later|last=Banse|first=Tom|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Japanese ship crashed in about 1850 near the mouth of the [[Columbia River]], Wickersham writes, and the sailors were assimilated into the local Native American population. While admitting there was no definitive proof of pre-Columbian contact between Japanese and North Americans, Wickersham thought it implausible that such contacts as outlined above would have started only after Europeans arrived in North America.

The idea that the Olmecs are related to Africans was suggested by José Melgar, who discovered the first [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal head]] at Hueyapan (now [[Tres Zapotes]]) in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Stirling, p. 2, who cites Melgar, Jose (1869) "Antigüedades mexicanas, notable escultura antigua", in ''Boletín de la Sociedad Mexicana de Geografía y Estadística'', época 2, vol. 1, pp. 292–297, Mexico, as well as Melgar, Jose (1871) "Estudio sobre la antigüedad y el origen de la Cabeza Colosal de tipo etiópico que existe en Hueyapan del cantón de los Tuxtlas" in ''Boletín de la Sociedad Mexicana de Geografía y Estadística'', época 2, vol. 3, pp. 104–109; Mexico.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Ivan Van Sertima]] has argued that these statues depict settlers or explorers from Africa, but his views have been the target of severe scholarly criticism.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/current/vansertima.pdf CA Forum on Anthropology in Public: Robbing Native Cultures: Van Sertima's Afrocentricity and the Olmecs]," in ''Current Anthropology'', Vol. 38, no. 3 (June 1997), 419-441&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leo Wiener]]'s "Africa and the Discovery of America" suggests similarities between [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] and native Mesoamerican religious symbols such as the winged serpent and the sun disk, or Quetzalcoatl, and words that have Mande roots and share similar meanings across both cultures such as "kore", "gadwal", and "qubila" (in Arabic) or "kofila" (in Mandinka). &lt;ref&gt;Leo Wiener, Africa and the Discovery of America, Philadelphia, p259, Inness and Sons, 1922, Vol 3 &lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt; Leo Wiener, Africa and the Discovery of America, American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 23, No. 1 (Jan. - Mar., 1921), pp. 83-94 &lt;/ref&gt;

According to the abstract of Columbus's log made by [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], the purpose of Columbus’s third voyage was to test both the claims of King [[John II of Portugal]] that "canoes had been found which set out from the coast of Guinea [West Africa] and sailed to the west with merchandise" as well as the claims of the native inhabitants of the Caribbean island of Hispaniola that "from the south and the southeast had come black people whose spears were made of a metal called [[guanín]]...from which it was found that of 32 parts: 18 were gold, 6 were silver, and 8 copper."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morison|first=Samuel Eliot|title=Journals &amp; Other Documents on the Life &amp; Voyages of Christopher Columbus|year=1963|publisher=The Heritage Press|location=New York|pages=262, 263}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thacher|first=John Boyd|title=Christopher Columbus: his life, his work, his remains, as revealed by original printed and manuscript records, together with an essay on Peter Martyr of Anghera and Bartolomé De Las Casas, the first Historians of America|year=1903|publisher=G.

Mulan Pi is mentioned in ''[[Lingwai Daida]]'' (1178) by [[Zhou Qufei]] and ''[[Zhu fan zhi|Zhufan Zhi]]'' (1225) by [[Chao Jukua]], together referred to as the "[[Sung Document]]".

The [[Solutrean hypothesis]] argues that Europeans migrated to the New World during the [[Paleolithic]] era, circa 16,000 to 13,000 BCE. This hypothesis proposes contact partly on the basis of perceived similarities between the flint tools of the [[Solutrean culture]] in modern-day France, Spain and Portugal (which thrived circa 20,000 to 15,000 BCE), and the [[Clovis culture]] of North America, which developed circa 9000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In this study, we identified and completely sequenced 14 mitochondrial DNAs belonging to one extremely rare Native American lineage known as haplogroup C4c. Its age and geographical distribution raise the possibility that C4c marked the Paleo-Indian group(s) that entered North America from Beringia through the ice-free corridor between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets. The similarities in ages and geographical distributions for C4c and the previously analyzed X2a lineage provide support to the scenario of a dual origin for Paleo-Indians.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Claims involving ancient Roman contact ===

Evidence of contacts with the civilizations of [[Classical Antiquity]]—primarily with the [[Roman Empire]], but sometimes also with other cultures of the age—have been based on isolated archaeological finds in American sites that originated in the Old World. The Bay of Jars in Brazil has been yielding ancient clay storage jars that resemble [[Amphora#Ancient Rome|Roman amphorae]]&lt;ref&gt;http://webmuseum.mit.edu/detail.php?type=related&amp;kv=87136&amp;t=objects&lt;/ref&gt; for over 150 years. It has been proposed that the origin of these jars is a Roman wreck, although it has been suggested that they could be 15th or 16th century Spanish olive oil jars.

Romeo Hristov argues that a Roman ship, or the drifting of such a shipwreck to the American shores, is a possible explanation of archaeological finds (like the Tecaxic-Calixtlahuaca bearded head) from ancient Rome in America. Hristov claims that the possibility of such an event has been made more likely by the discovery of evidences of travels from Romans to [[Tenerife]] and [[Lanzarote]] in the [[Canary Islands|Canaries]], and of a Roman settlement (from the 1st century BCE to the 4th century CE) on [[Lanzarote|Lanzarote island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Hristov|first1=Romeo H.|last2=Genovés T.|first2=Santiago|year=1999|title=Mesoamerica evidence of pre-Columbian transoceanic contacts|journal=Ancient Mesoamerica|volume=10|pages=207–213|doi=10.1017/S0956536199102013|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, an Italian botanist, Domenico Casella, suggested that a depiction of a [[pineapple]] was represented among wall paintings of Mediterranean fruits at [[Pompeii]]. According to [[Wilhelmina Feemster Jashemski]], this interpretation has been challenged by other botanists, who identify it as a pine [[conifer cone|cone]] from the [[Stone Pine|Umbrella pine tree]], which is native to the Mediterranean area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jashemski |first=Wilhelmina |title=The natural history of Pompeii |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-80054-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3xfjyTqqR7IC&amp;pg=PA81 |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tecaxic-Calixtlahuaca head ====
{{See also|Tecaxic-Calixtlahuaca head}}

A small [[terracotta]] head sculpture, with a beard and European-like features, was found in 1933 (in the [[Toluca Valley]], 72 kilometres southwest of [[Mexico City]]) in a burial offering under three intact floors of a [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|pre-colonial]] building dated to between 1476 and 1510. The artifact has been studied by Roman art authority Bernard Andreae, director emeritus of the German Institute of Archaeology in Rome, Italy, and Austrian anthropologist [[Robert von Heine-Geldern]], both of whom stated that the style of the artifact was compatible with small Roman sculptures of the 2nd century. If genuine and if not placed there after 1492 (the pottery found with it dates to between 1476 and 1510)&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Jack D. ''The American Discovery of Europe'' University of Illinois Press;  April 16, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-252-03152-6}} p.108&lt;/ref&gt; the find provides evidence for at least a one-time contact between the Old and New Worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Hristov and Genovés (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arizona State University|ASU]]'s Michael E. Smith,&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.public.asu.edu/~mesmith9/"&lt;/ref&gt; John Paddock, a leading Mesoamerican scholar, used to tell his classes in the years before he died that the artifact was planted as a joke by Hugo Moedano, a student who originally worked on the site. Despite speaking with individuals who knew the original discoverer (García Payón), and Moedano, Smith says he has been unable to confirm or reject this claim. Though he remains skeptical, Smith concedes he cannot rule out the possibility that the head was a genuinely buried Post-classic offering at Calixtlahuaca.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael E., "[http://www.public.asu.edu/~mesmith9/tval/RomanFigurine.html The 'Roman Figurine' Supposedly Excavated at Calixtlahuaca]".

Henry was the grandfather of [[William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness]], the builder of [[Rosslyn Chapel]] (near [[Edinburgh]], Scotland).

Knight and Lomas view these carvings as evidence supporting the idea that Henry Sinclair travelled to the Americas well before Columbus. In their book they discuss meeting with the wife of the botanist Adrian Dyer, and that Dyer's wife told him that Dyer agreed that the image thought to be maize was accurate.&lt;ref name="THK"/&gt; In fact Dyer found only one identifiable plant among the botanical carvings and suggested that the "maize" and "aloe" were stylized wooden patterns, only coincidentally looking like real plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turnbull|first1=Michael TRB|title=Rosslyn Chapel|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/places/rosslynchapel_1.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 December 2016|date=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialists in medieval architecture interpret these carvings as stylised depictions of wheat, strawberries or lilies.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Oxbrow &amp; I.

Some have conjectured that Columbus was able to persuade the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Aragon]] to support his planned voyage only because they were aware of some recent earlier voyage across the Atlantic. Some suggest that Columbus himself visited Canada or Greenland before 1492, because according to [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] he wrote he had sailed 100 leagues past an island he called [[Thule]] in 1477. Whether he actually did this and what island he visited, if any, is uncertain. Columbus is thought to have visited [[Bristol]] in 1476.&lt;ref&gt;"It is most probable that Columbus visited Bristol, where he was introduced to English commerce with Iceland." [[Silvio Bedini|Bedini, Silvio A.]] and David Buisseret (1992). ''The Christopher Columbus encyclopedia, Volume 1'', University of Michigan press, republished by Simon &amp; Schuster, {{ISBN|0-13-142670-2}}, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Bristol was also the port from which [[John Cabot]] sailed in 1497, crewed mostly by Bristol sailors. In a letter of late 1497 or early 1498 the English merchant John Day wrote to Columbus about Cabot's discoveries, saying that land found by Cabot was "discovered in the past by the men from Bristol who found 'Brasil' as your lordship knows".&lt;ref&gt;Seaver (1995) p.222&lt;/ref&gt; There may be records of expeditions from [[Bristol]] to find the "[[Brazil (mythical island)|isle of Brazil]]" in 1480 and 1481.&lt;ref&gt;Seaver, K.A.(1995) ''The Frozen Echo'' Stanford University Press {{ISBN|0-8047-3161-6}} p.221&lt;/ref&gt; Trade between Bristol and Iceland is well documented from the mid 15th century.

[[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés]] records several such legends in his ''General y natural historia de las Indias'' of 1526, which includes biographical information on Columbus. He discusses the then-current story of a Spanish caravel that was swept off its course while on its way to England, and wound up in a foreign land populated by naked tribesmen. The crew gathered supplies and made its way back to Europe, but the trip took several months and the captain and most of the men died before reaching land. The ship's pilot, a man called [[Alonso Sánchez]],  and very few others finally made it to Portugal, but all were very ill. Columbus was a good friend of the pilot, and took him to be treated in his own house, and the pilot described the land they had seen and marked it on a map before dying. People in Oviedo's time knew this story in several versions, but Oviedo regarded it as myth.&lt;ref&gt;Columbus, Christopher; Cohen, J. M. (translator) (May 5, 1992). ''The Four Voyages'', pp. 27–37.

In 1925, Soren Larsen wrote a book claiming that a joint Danish-Portuguese expedition landed in Newfoundland or Labrador in 1473 and again in 1476.

The legend of Saint [[Brendan]], an Irish monk, involves a fantastical journey into the Atlantic Ocean in search of Paradise in the 6th century.  Since the discovery of the New World, various authors have tried to link the Brendan legend with an early discovery of America. In 1977 The voyage was successfully recreated by [[Tim Severin]] using an ancient Irish [[Currach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/05/16/did-st-brendan-reach-north-america-500-years-before-the-vikings/|title=Did St. Brendan Reach North America 500 Years Before the Vikings? – National Geographic Society (blogs)|first=Andrew|last=Howley|website=voices.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a British myth, [[Madoc]] was a prince from Wales who explored the Americas as early as 1170. While most scholars consider this legend to be untrue, it was used as justification for British claims to the Americas, based on the notion of a Briton arriving before other European nationalities.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Gwyn A (1979): ''Madoc: The Making of a Myth''. London: Eyre Methuen&lt;/ref&gt;

== Claims of trans-oceanic travel originating from the New World ==

=== Claims of Egyptian coca and tobacco ===
[[File:RAMmummy.jpg|right|thumb|The [[mummy]] of [[Ramesses II]]]]

Traces of [[coca]] and [[nicotine]] found in some Egyptian mummies have led to speculation that [[Ancient Egyptians]] may have had contact with the New World. The initial discovery was made by a German [[toxicologist]], Svetlana Balabanova, after examining the mummy of a priestess called [[Henut Taui]]. Follow-up tests of the hair shaft, performed to rule out contamination, gave the same results.&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~legneref/ethnic/mummy.htm"&lt;/ref&gt;

A television show reported that examination of numerous [[Sudan|Sudanese]] mummies undertaken by Balabanova mirrored what was found in the mummy of Henut Taui.&lt;ref name="Curseof"&gt;"Curse of the Cocaine Mummies" written and directed by Sarah Marris. (Producers: Hilary Lawson, Maureen Lemire and narrated by Hilary Kilberg). A TVF Production for Channel Four in association with the Discovery Channel, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Balabanova suggested that the tobacco may be accounted for since it may have also been known in China and Europe, as indicated by analysis run on human remains from those respective regions. Balabanova proposed that such plants native to the general area may have developed independently, but have since gone extinct.&lt;ref name="Curseof" /&gt; Other explanations include fraud, though curator Alfred Grimm of the Egyptian Museum in [[Munich]] disputes this.&lt;ref name="Curseof" /&gt;  Skeptical of Balabanova's findings, Rosalie David, Keeper of Egyptology at the [[Manchester Museum]], had similar tests performed on samples taken from the Manchester mummy collection and reported that two of the tissue samples and one hair sample did test positive for nicotine.&lt;ref name="Curseof" /&gt;  Sources of nicotine other than tobacco and sources of cocaine in the Old World are discussed by the British biologist Duncan Edlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&amp;file=article&amp;sid=45 |title=A look at the Evidence for Cocaine in Mummies |publisher=Thehallofmaat.com |accessdate=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream scholars remain skeptical, and they do not see this as proof of ancient contact between Africa and the Americas, especially because there may be possible Old World sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&amp;file=article&amp;sid=45 |title=The Stoned Age? |publisher=Hall of Maat |accessdate=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buckland"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buckland | first1 = P.C. | last2 = Panagiotakopulu | first2 = E | title = Rameses II and the tobacco beetle | url = | journal = Antiquity | volume = 75 | issue = 549–56| page = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two attempts to replicate Balabanova's finds of cocaine failed, suggesting "that either Balabanova and her associates are misinterpreting their results or that the samples of mummies tested by them have been mysteriously exposed to cocaine."&lt;ref&gt;Counsell, D. C.,  "Intoxicants in Ancient Egypt? Opium, nymphea, coca, and tobacco," in David, Ann Rosalie, ed. '''Egyptian Mummies and Modern Science''', Cambridge University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-521-86579-1}} p.213&lt;/ref&gt;

A re-examination in the 1970s of the mummy of [[Ramesses II]] revealed the presence of fragments of tobacco leaves in its abdomen. This became a popular topic in fringe literature and the media and was seen as proof of contact between Ancient Egypt and the New World. The investigator, [[Maurice Bucaille]], noted that when the mummy was unwrapped in 1886 the abdomen was left open and that "it was no longer possible to attach any importance to the presence inside the abdominal cavity of whatever material was found there, since the material could have come from the surrounding environment."&lt;ref&gt;Bucaille, M. ''Mummies of the Pharaohs: Modern Medical Investigations'' NY: St. Martin’s Press pp 186-188&lt;/ref&gt; Following the renewed discussion of tobacco sparked by Balabanova's research and its mention in a 2000 publication by Rosalie David, a study in the journal ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'' suggested that reports of both tobacco and cocaine in mummies "ignored their post-excavation histories" and pointed out that the mummy of Ramesses II had been moved five times between 1883 and 1975.&lt;ref name="Buckland" /&gt;

=== Icelander DNA finding ===
In 2010 Sigríður Sunna Ebenesersdóttir published a genetic study showing that over 350 living Icelanders carried mitochondrial DNA of a new type that is similar to the type found only in Native American and East Asian populations. Using the [[deCODE genetics]] database, Sigríður Sunna determined that the DNA entered the Icelandic population not later than 1700, and likely several centuries earlier.  However Sigríður Sunna also states that "...while a Native American origin seems most likely for [this new haplogroup], an Asian or European origin cannot be ruled out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajpa.21419|pmid=21069749|title=A new subclade of mtDNA haplogroup C1 found in icelanders: Evidence of pre-columbian contact?|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=144|issue=1|pages=92–9|year=2011|last1=Ebenesersdóttir|first1=Sigríður Sunna|last2=Sigurðsson|first2=Ásgeir|last3=Sánchez-Quinto|first3=Federico|last4=Lalueza-Fox|first4=Carles|last5=Stefánsson|first5=Kári|last6=Helgason|first6=Agnar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norse legends and sagas ===
[[Image:Thorfinn Karlsefni 1918.jpg|thumb|150px|Statue of Thorfinn Karlsefni.]]
In 1009, legends report that Norse explorer [[Thorfinn Karlsefni]] abducted two children from [[Markland]], an area on the North American mainland where Norse explorers visited but did not settle. The two children were then taken to Greenland, where they were baptized and taught to speak Norse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/17946/17946-h/17946-h.htm Eirik the Red's Saga by John Sephton] paragraph 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1420, Danish geographer [[Claudius Clavus Swart]] wrote that he personally had seen "[[pygmies]]" from Greenland who were caught by Norsemen in a small skin boat. Their boat was hung in [[Nidaros Cathedral]] in [[Trondheim]] along with another, longer boat also taken from "pygmies". Clavus Swart's description fits the Inuit and two of their types of boats, the [[kayak]] and the [[umiak]].&lt;ref name=ADE163 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ANA /&gt; Similarly, the Swedish clergyman [[Olaus Magnus]] wrote in 1505 that he saw in [[Oslo Cathedral]] two leather boats taken decades earlier. According to Olaus, the boats were captured from Greenland pirates by one of the [[Haakon (disambiguation)|Haakons]], which would place the event in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=ADE163 /&gt;

In [[Ferdinand Columbus]]'s biography of his father Christopher, he says that in 1477 his father saw in [[Galway]], [[Ireland]] two dead bodies which had washed ashore in their boat. The bodies and boat were of exotic appearance, and have been suggested to have been [[Inuit]] who had drifted off course.&lt;ref&gt;Seaver (1995), p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inuit ===

It has been suggested that the Norse took other indigenous peoples to Europe as slaves over the following centuries, because they are known to have taken Scottish and Irish slaves.&lt;ref name=ADE163&gt;{{cite book |title= The American Discovery of Europe|last= Forbes |first= Jack D. |year= 2007 |publisher= University of Illinois Press |location= |isbn= 978-0-252-03152-6 |page= 163|url= https://books.google.com/?id=cd8yZn7MfSQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=American+Discovery+of+Europe#v=onepage&amp;q=Nidaros&amp;f=false|accessdate= December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ANA&gt;{{cite book |title= Africans and Native Americans: The Language of Race and the Evolution of Red-Black Peoples|last= Forbes |first= Jack D. |year= 1993|publisher= University of Illinois Press |location= |isbn= 978-0-252-06321-3 |pages= 18–21| url= https://books.google.com/?id=6aLAeB5QiHAC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=Trondheim+cathedral+Inuit#v=onepage&amp;q=Trondheim%20cathedral%20Inuit&amp;f=false |accessdate= December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence of Inuit coming to Europe under their own power or as captives after 1492. A substantial body of Greenland Inuit folklore first collected in the 19th century told of journeys by boat to [[Akilineq]], here depicted as a rich country across the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= In Order to Live Untroubled: Inuit of the Central Arctic, 1550–1940 |last= Fossett|first= Renée |year= 2001 |publisher= University of Manitoba Press|location= |isbn= 978-0-88755-647-0 |pages= 75–77 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=yK7cac_mXGgC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=Inuit+in+Europe+Trondheim#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Columbian contact between [[Alaska]] and [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] via the [[subarctic]] [[Aleutian Islands]] would have been conceivable, but the two settlement waves on this archipelago started on the American side and its western continuation, the [[Commander Islands]], remained uninhabited until after [[Vitus Bering|Russian explorers]] encountered the [[Aleut people]] in 1741. There is no genetic or linguistic evidence for earlier contact along this route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Peopling of the Aleutians |date=January 13, 2012 |journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.335.6065.158 |volume=335 |number=6065 |pages=158–161 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6065/158|bibcode=2012Sci...335..158B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious claims ==
=== 17th-century speculation ===
{{Main article|Ten Lost Tribes}}
In 1650, a British preacher in Norfolk, Thomas Thorowgood, published ''Jewes in America or Probabilities that the Americans are of that Race'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://olivercowdery.com/texts/1660Thor.htm Oliver's Bookshelf, The Premier Web-Site for Early Mormon History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184039/http://olivercowdery.com/texts/1660Thor.htm |date=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the New England missionary society. Tudor Parfitt writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;The society was active in trying to convert the Indians but suspected that they might be Jews and realized they better be prepared for an arduous task. Thorowgood's tract argued that the native population of North America were descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parfitt|first=Tudor|title=The Lost Tribes of Israel: The History of a Myth|publisher=Phoenix|year=2003|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1652 [[Hamon L'Estrange|Sir Hamon L'Estrange]], an English author writing on history and theology, published ''Americans no Jews, or improbabilities that the Americans are of that Race'' in response to the tract by Thorowgood. In response to L'Estrange, Thorowgood published a second edition of his book in 1660 with a revised title and included a foreword written by [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]], a [[Puritan]] missionary who had translated the Bible into an Indian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parfitt|first=Tudor|title=The Lost Tribes of Israel: The History of a Myth|publisher=Phoenix|year=2003|pages=66, 76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mormon teachings ===
[[File:Izapa Stela 5.svg|right|thumb|upright|[[Izapa Stela 5]]]]
{{Main article|Archaeology and the Book of Mormon|Genetics and the Book of Mormon}}
The [[Book of Mormon]], a [[sacred text]] of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] published by  founder and leader [[Joseph Smith Jr]] in 1830 at the age of twenty-four, states that some ancient inhabitants of the New World are descendants of Semitic peoples who sailed from the Old World. Mormon groups such as the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] attempt to study and expand on these ideas. Scientific consensus rejects these claims.

The [[National Geographic Society]], in a 1998 letter to the [[Institute for Religious Research]], stated "Archaeologists and other scholars have long probed the hemisphere's past and the society does not know of anything found so far that has substantiated the Book of Mormon."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mit.irr.org/national-geographic-society-statement-on-book-of-mormon "National Geographic Society Statement on the Book of Mormon"].  August 12, 1998.  Letter from Julie Crain addressed to Luke Wilson of the Institute for Religious Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some LDS scholars hold the view that archaeological study of Book of Mormon claims are not meant to vindicate the literary narrative.  For example, [[Terryl Givens]], professor of English at the University of Richmond, points out that there is a lack of historical accuracy in the Book of Mormon in relation to modern archaeological knowledge.&lt;ref name="Givens2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Givens|first=Terryl|title=The Latter-day Saint Experience i n America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IEEkTWyIpZkC&amp;pg=PA145|accessdate=8 November 2014|date=2004-01-01|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32750-6|pages=145–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, Professor M. Wells Jakeman popularized a belief that the [[Izapa Stela 5]] represents the Book of Mormon prophets Lehi and Nephi's [[tree of life vision]], and was a validation of the historicity of the claims of pre-Columbian settlement in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;*{{aut|Brewer, Stewart W.}}, (1999); [http://farms.byu.edu/display.php?table=jbms&amp;id=180 "The History of an Idea: The Scene on Stela 5 from Izapa, Mexico, as a Representation of Lehi's Vision of the Tree of Life"], (p. 12)&lt;/ref&gt; His interpretations of the carving and its connection to pre-Columbian contact have been disputed.&lt;ref name="Paulson2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Paulson|first=Matthew A.|title=Breaking the Mormon Code|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pbi_OfkPhzwC&amp;pg=PA236|accessdate=8 November 2014|date=2000-09-01|publisher=WingSpan Press|isbn=978-1-59594-067-4|pages=236–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since that time, scholarship on the Book of Mormon has concentrated on cultural parallels rather than "smoking gun" sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lund|first=John|title=MesoAmerica And The Book of Mormon|date=2007-11-22|publisher=Granite Publishing &amp; Distribution|isbn=978-1891114403|pages=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Joseph|title=Exploring the Lands of the Book of Mormon|date=1989-06-15|publisher=S.A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6546">'''Preservationist''' is generally understood to mean ''historic preservationist'': one who advocates to preserve architecturally or historically significant buildings, structures, objects, or sites from demolition or degradation. [[Historic preservation]] usually refers to the preservation of the built environment, not to the preservation of, for instance, primeval forests or wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Maryland Association of Historic District Commissions, ''[http://www.mahdc.org/index.php/library-of-resources Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727055105/http://www.mahdc.org/index.php/library-of-resources |date=2011-07-27 }}'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Preservationist'' is, however, sometimes used descriptively in other contexts, notably with regards to language and the environment.

==Other uses of the term==
Persons who work to preserve ancient or [[endangered language]]s are called [[Language preservation|language preservationists.]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Language Preservation: UNESCO-CI |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=11171&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20060706085338/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=11171&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-07-06 |accessdate=2007-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Clarification: ''Ethnologue,'' a reference work published by [[SIL International]], has cataloged the world’s known living languages, and it estimates that 417 languages are on the verge of extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ |accessdate=2007-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservationist is also sometimes used in the natural [[environmentalist]] field, but while the natural environment [[conservation movement|conservationist]] movements preserve [[ecosystem]]s and the [[natural environment]], this movement is widely known as ''[[conservation ethic|conservation]]'' or ''[[environmentalism]]''. 

*Clarification: A key difference between the Preservationist and [[conservation movement|Conservationist]] [[environmentalist]] schools is this: Preservationists view the environment as having intrinsic value that should be preserved by making as little change to it as possible. Conservationists view the environment as having instrumental value that can be of help to people,&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Earle Funk]], ''What's the Name, Please?'', Funk &amp; Wagnalls, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; and generally accept [[Gifford Pinchot]]'s notion of [[sustainable yield]]: that man can harvest some forest or animal products from a natural environment on a regular basis without compromising the long-health of the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;W.N. Sparhawk, "The History of Forestry in America" in Trees: Yearbook of Agriculture,1949. Washington,D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservationism has been defined by [[Richard Heinberg]] in his book ''Powerdown: Options and Actions for a Post-Carbon World'' as distinguishing survivalist groups who wish merely to survive a collapse of civilization from preservationist communities who wish to preserve as much of human culture as is possible in the event of collapse. 

*Clarification: The idea of preservationist communities is part of a broader strategy in which individuals achieve independence from the centralized power grid, forming sustainable communities that could provide mutual support in the event of critical depletion of non-renewable resources.&lt;ref&gt;Powerdown: Options and Actions for a Post-Carbon World ({{ISBN|9780865715103}}) (2004; British edition 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Primitive communism''' is a concept originating from [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] who argued that [[hunter-gatherer]] societies were traditionally based on egalitarian social relations and common ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Sociology  |last=Scott |first=John |authorlink= |author2=Marshall, Gordon |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=USA |isbn=978-0-19-860987-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A primary inspiration for both Marx and Engels were [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]'s descriptions of "communism in living" as practised by the [[Iroquois Nation]] of North America.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, L. H. 1881. ''Houses and House-Life of the American Aborigines''. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In Marx's model of socioeconomic structures, societies with primitive communism had no hierarchical [[social class]] structures or [[capital accumulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Man the Hunter |last=Lee |first=Richard |last2=DeVore |first2=Irven |year=1969 |publisher=Aldine Transaction |isbn=978-0-202-33032-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engels offered the first detailed theorization of primitive communism in 1884, with publication of  ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State]]''. Marx and Engels used the term more broadly than Marxists did later, and applied it not only to hunter-gatherers but also to some [[subsistence agriculture]] communities. There is also no agreement among later scholars, including Marxists, on the historical extent, or longevity, of primitive communism.

Marx and Engels also noted how capitalist accumulation latched itself onto social organizations of ''primitive communism''. For instance, in private correspondence the same year that ''The Origin of the Family'' was published, Engels attacked [[European colonialism]], describing the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch regime]] in [[Java (island)|Java]] directly organizing agricultural production and profiting from it, "on the basis of the old communistic village communities".&lt;ref&gt;Engels, cited by T. B. Bottomore, ''A Dictionary of Marxist Thought'', Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell, 1991, p174.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that cases like the Dutch East Indies, [[British Raj|British India]] and the [[Russian Empire]] showed "how today primitive communism furnishes ... the finest and broadest basis of [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]]".

In a primitive communist society, all able bodied persons would have engaged in obtaining food, and everyone would share in what was produced by hunting and gathering.

Domestication of animals and plants following the [[Neolithic Revolution]] through [[herding]] and [[agriculture]] was seen as the turning point from primitive communism to [[class society]] as it was followed by private ownership and [[slavery]], with the inequality that they entailed. In addition, parts of the population specialized in different activities, such as manufacturing, [[culture]], [[philosophy]], and [[science]] which is said to lead to the development of [[social class]]es.&lt;ref name="ablongman" /&gt;

Egalitarian and communist-like hunter gatherer societies have been studied and described by many well-known social anthropologists including James Woodburn,&lt;ref&gt;James Woodburn (1982).

In ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute'' 14:2: 297-315.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologists such as [[Christopher Boehm]],&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, C. 2001. ''Hierarchy in the Forest.

Lewis 2014. "Vocal deception, laughter, and the linguistic significance of reverse dominance". Chapter 21 in D. Dor, C. Knight and J. Lewis (eds), ''The Social Origins of Language''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; offer theoretical accounts to explain how communistic, assertively egalitarian social arrangements might have emerged in the [[prehistory|prehistoric past]]. Despite differences in emphasis, these and other anthropologists follow Engels in arguing that evolutionary change—resistance to primate-style sexual and political dominance—culminated eventually in a revolutionary transition. [[Richard Borshay Lee]] criticizes the mainstream and [[dominant culture]]'s long-time bias against the possible existence of primitive communism, deriding "[[Bourgeois]] ideology [that] would have us believe that primitive communism doesn't exist. In popular consciousness it is lumped with romanticism, exoticism: the noble savage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title= ''Richard B. Lee, 1992. "Demystifying Primitive Communism".

The '''''Scepter of Judah''''' ({{lang-he|'''Shebet Yehuda'''|script=Latn}} {{Hebrew|שבט יהודה}}) was a text produced by the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] [[historian]] [[Solomon Ibn Verga]]. It first appeared in [[Turkey]] in 1553.

The work was essentially a comprehensive analysis of sixty-four different [[persecution]]s that the [[Jewish]] people had suffered since [[ancient history|antiquity]]. Hardly an insular text, it made use of [[Latin]] sources as well. It also had a certain [[anthropological]] value, as Ibn Verga discussed the [[customs]] and practices of Jews in various lands. Ibn Verga also sought to highlight what he felt were the faults of his people, and as such, much of his [[criticism]]s of the Jews are exaggerated for effect.

In many ways the ''Scepter of Judah'' was the first and most significant work of Jewish [[historiography]]; it was essentially the first time that such a comprehensive interest had been expressed by the Jews in their past. Ibn Verga sought to clarify the problem of anti-Jewish sentiment, which had manifested itself in the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion of the Jews from Spain]] in 1492. According to the author, the expulsion from Spain and Jewish exile in general were natural phenomena that were subject to historical forces of causation and explanation. They were not simply "punishment" for the [[sins]] of the Jewish people, as had been the time-honored way of explaining such misfortunes.

The text posited the view that the [[Anti-Semitism|hatred of the Jews]] is a popular inheritance which is passed from [[generation]] to generation. It is occasioned by [[religious fanaticism]] (as had been the case in Spain) and is compounded by [[envy]] and [[jealousy]]; it also stems from a lack of [[education]]. Ibn Verga also suggested that there was perhaps too much flaunting of opulence amongst the [[Sephardim]]; certain festivities had been too extravagant, which had raised antagonism and jealousy amongst [[Catholics]].  Whether this was actually the case is debatable.

The ''Scepter of Judah'' was one of the most popular Jewish history books of all time, perhaps the most popular until the 19th century.

The [[Winter Triangle]] is formed from the three brightest stars in the northern winter sky: Sirius, [[Betelgeuse]] (''top right''), and [[Procyon]] (''top left'').]]

The '''Sothic cycle''' or '''Canicular period''' is a period of 1,461 [[Egyptian civil year]]s of 365 days each or 1,460 [[Julian calendar|Julian years]] averaging 365¼ days each. During a Sothic cycle, the 365-day year loses enough time that the start of its year once again coincides with the [[heliacal rising]] of the star [[Sirius]] ({{lang-egy|[[wikt:spdt|Spdt]]}} or ''[[Sopdet]]'', "Triangle"; {{lang-grc-gre|Σῶθις}}, ''Sō̂this'') on 19 July in the [[Julian calendar]].&lt;ref name=lavia/&gt;{{efn|The date slowly varies within the [[Gregorian calendar]], owing to its omission of three leap years every four centuries. It presently occurs on 3 August.&lt;ref name=lavia&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.lavia.org/english/archivo/egyptiancalendaren.html |contribution=Ancient Egyptian Civil Calendar |title=La Via |url=http://www.lavia.org/indexIT.html |accessdate=8 February 2017 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} It is an important aspect of [[Egyptology]], particularly with regard to reconstructions of the [[Egyptian calendar]] and its history. [[Egyptian astronomy|Astronomical records]] of this displacement may have been responsible for the later establishment of the more accurate [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Alexandrian calendar]]s.

==Mechanics==
The [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[Egyptian calendar|civil year]], its holidays, and religious records reflect its apparent establishment at a point when the [[heliacal rising|return]] of the bright star [[Sirius (star)|Sirius]] to the night sky was considered to herald the [[flooding of the Nile|annual flooding]] of the [[Nile]].&lt;ref name=teacosy/&gt; However, because the civil calendar was exactly 365 days long and did not incorporate [[leap year]]s until 22{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, its months "wandered" backwards through the [[solar year]] at the rate of about one day in every four years. This almost exactly corresponded to its displacement against the {{nowrap|'''Sothic year'''}} as well. (The Sothic year is about a minute longer than a [[solar year]].)&lt;ref name=teacosy&gt;{{harvp|Tetley|2014|p=[http://www.egyptchronology.com/uploads/2/6/9/4/26943741/ch_3_investigating_ancient_egyptian_calendars.pdf 42]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sidereal year]] of 365.25636 days is only valid for stars on the [[ecliptic]] (the apparent path of the [[Sun]] across the sky), whereas Sirius's displacement ~40˚ below the ecliptic, its [[proper motion]], and the wobbling of the [[celestial equator]] cause the period between its [[heliacal rising]]s to be almost exactly 365.25 days long instead. This steady loss of one relative day every four years over the course of the 365-day calendar meant that the "wandering" day would return to its original place relative to the solar and Sothic year after precisely 1461 civil or 1460 Julian years.

==Discovery==
This cycle was first noticed by [[Eduard Meyer]] in 1904, who then carefully combed known Egyptian inscriptions and written materials to find any mention of the calendar dates when Sirius rose at dawn. He found six of them, on which the dates of much of the [[conventional Egyptian chronology]] are based. A heliacal rise of Sirius was recorded by [[Censorinus]] as having happened on the Egyptian New Year's Day between {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}139 and 142.&lt;ref name=Kitchen&gt;Kitchen, K. A. ''The Chronology of Ancient Egypt.'' p.205. World Archaeology,  Vol. 23, No. 2 (October 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; The record actually refers to 21{{nbsp}}July {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}140 but is astronomically calculated as a definite 20{{nbsp}}July {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}139. This correlates the Egyptian calendar to the Julian calendar. Leap day occurs in {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}140, and so the new year on 1{{nbsp}}[[Thoth (month)|Thoth]] is 20{{nbsp}}July in {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}139 but it is 19{{nbsp}}July for {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}140-142. Thus he was able to compare the day on which Sirius rose in the Egyptian calendar to the day on which Sirius ought to have risen in the Julian calendar, count the number of intercalary days needed, and determine how many years were between the beginning of a cycle and the observation. One also needs to know the place of observation, since the latitude of the observation changes the day when the heliacal rising of Sirius occurs, and mislocating an observation can potentially change the resulting chronology by several decades.&lt;ref name=Kitchen/&gt; (Official observations were made at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] or [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] near [[Cairo]], [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], and [[Elephantine]] near [[Aswan]],&lt;ref name=teatime/&gt; with the rising of Sirius observed at Cairo about 8 days after it is seen at Aswan.)&lt;ref name=teatime&gt;{{citation |last=Tetley |first=M.

But research and discoveries have since shown that the [[first dynasty of Egypt]] did not begin before {{nowrap|c. [[4th millennium BC|3100 {{sc|bc}}]]}}, and the claim that 19{{nbsp}}July 4241{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} is the "earliest fixed date" has since been discredited.

''A History of Ancient Egypt.'' p.52. Librairie Arthéme Fayard, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronological interpretation==
Three specific observations of the heliacal rise of Sirius are extremely important for Egyptian chronology. The first is the aforementioned ivory tablet from the reign of [[Djer]] which supposedly indicates the beginning of a Sothic cycle, the rising of Sirius on the same day as the new year. If this does indicate the beginning of a Sothic cycle, it must date to about 17 July 2773{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, Nicolas. ''A History of Ancient Egypt.'' p.51. Librairie Arthéme Fayard, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this date is too late for Djer's reign, so many scholars believe that it indicates a correlation between the rising of Sirius and the Egyptian ''lunar'' calendar, instead of the solar civil calendar, which would render the tablet essentially devoid of chronological value.&lt;ref name=Grimal/&gt;
A newly discovered Sothis-date from the Old Kingdom and a subsequent astronomic study confirms the Sothic cycle model [http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/18741665-12340035 Gautschy et al. 2017 A New Astronomically Based Chronological Model for the Egyptian Old Kingdom]

The second observation is clearly a reference to a heliacal rising, and is believed to date to the seventh year of [[Senusret III]]. This observation was almost certainly made at [[Itj-Tawy]], the Twelfth Dynasty capital, which would date the Twelfth Dynasty from 1963 to 1786{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}.&lt;ref name=Kitchen/&gt; The Ramses or Turin Papyrus Canon says 213 years (1991-1778{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}), [[Richard Anthony Parker|Parker]] reduces it to 206 years (1991-1785{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}), based on 17{{nbsp}}July 1872{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} as the Sothic date (120th year of 12th dynasty, a drift of 30 leap days). Prior to Parker's investigation of lunar dates the 12th dynasty was placed as 213 years of 2007-1794{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} perceiving the date as 21 July 1888{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} as the 120th year, and then as 2003-1790{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} perceiving the date as 20 July 1884{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} as the 120th year.

The third observation was in the reign of [[Amenhotep I]], and, assuming it was made in Thebes, dates his reign between 1525 and 1504{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. If made in Memphis, Heliopolis, or some other Delta site instead, as a minority of scholars still argue, the entire chronology of the 18th Dynasty needs to be expanded by some 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, Nicolas. ''A History of Ancient Egypt.'' p.202. Librairie Arthéme Fayard, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observational mechanics and precession==
The Sothic cycle is a specific example of two cycles of differing length interacting to cycle together, here called a tertiary cycle. This is mathematically defined by the formula 1/a + 1/b = 1/t or half the [[harmonic mean]]. In the case of the Sothic cycle the two cycles are the Egyptian civil year and the Sothic year. 

The Sothic year is the length of time for the star Sirius to visually return to the same position in relation to the sun. Star years measured in this way vary due to [[axial precession]],&lt;ref&gt;Ingham, M. F. "The Length of the Sothic Cycle", ''The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology'', '''55''' (1969), p. 36-40.&lt;/ref&gt; the movement of the Earth's axis in relation to the sun. The length of time for a star to make a yearly path can be marked when it rises to a defined altitude above a local horizon at the time of sunrise. This altitude does not have to be the altitude of first possible visibility. Throughout the year the star will rise approximately four minutes earlier each successive sunrise. Eventually the star will return to its same relative location at sunrise. This length of time can be called an observational year. Stars that reside close to the ecliptic or the ecliptic meridian will on average exhibit observational years close to the sidereal year of 365.2564 days. The ecliptic and the meridian cut the sky into four quadrants. The axis of the earth wobbles around slowly moving the observer and changing the observation of the event. If the axis swings the observer closer to the event its observational year will be shortened. Likewise, the observational year can be lengthened when the axis swings away from the observer. This depends upon which quadrant of the sky the phenomenon is observed.

The Sothic year is remarkable because its average duration was exactly 365.25 days in the early {{nowrap|4th millennium {{sc|bc}}&lt;ref&gt;SkyCharts III&lt;/ref&gt;}} before the unification of Egypt. The slow rate of change from this value is also of note. If observations and records could have been maintained during predynastic times the Sothic rise would optimally return to the same calendar day after 1461 calendar years. This value would drop to about 1456 calendar years by the Middle Kingdom. The 1461 value could also be maintained if the date of the Sothic rise were artificially maintained by moving the feast in celebration of this event one day every fourth year instead of rarely adjusting it according to observation.

It has been noticed, and the Sothic cycle confirms, that Sirius does not move retrograde across the sky like other stars, a phenomenon widely known as the [[precession of the equinox]]. Professor [[Jed Buchwald]] wrote "Sirius remains about the same distance from the equinoxes—and so from the solstices—throughout these many centuries, despite precession." &lt;ref&gt;Buchwald, Jed Z. (2003), [http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/4096/1/Egyptian.pdf "Egyptian Stars under Paris Skies"], ''Engineering and Science'' (Caltech), 66 (4) (2003) 20–31.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the same reason, the helical rising or zenith of Sirius does not slip through the calendar at the precession rate of about one day per 71.6 years as other stars do but much slower.&lt;ref&gt;One day per 120 years, see Winlock H., ''Origin of the Ancient Egyptian Calendar'', Proc. of the Am. Philosophical Soc., '''83''' (1940): 447-64.&lt;/ref&gt; This remarkable stability within the solar year may be one reason that the Egyptians used it as a basis for their calendar. The coincidence of a heliacal rising of Sirius and the New Year reported by Censorinus occurred about the 20th of July, that is a month later after the summer solstice.

==Problems and criticisms==
Determining the date of a heliacal rise of Sirius has been shown to be difficult, especially considering the need to know the exact latitude of the observation.&lt;ref name=Kitchen/&gt; Another problem is that because the Egyptian calendar loses one day every four years, a heliacal rise will take place on the same day for four years in a row, and any observation of that rise can date to any of those four years, making the observation imprecise.&lt;ref name=Kitchen/&gt;

A number of criticisms have been leveled against the reliability of dating by the Sothic cycle. Some are serious enough to be considered problematic.  Firstly, none of the astronomical observations have dates that mention the specific pharaoh in whose reign they were observed, forcing Egyptologists to supply that information on the basis of a certain amount of informed speculation.  Secondly, there is no information regarding the nature of the civil calendar throughout the course of Egyptian history, forcing Egyptologists to assume that it existed unchanged for thousands of years; the Egyptians would only have needed to carry out one calendar reform in a few thousand years for these calculations to be worthless.  Other criticisms are not considered as problematic, e.g. there is no extant mention of the Sothic cycle in ancient Egyptian writing, which may simply be a result of it either being so obvious to Egyptians that it didn't merit mention or to relevant texts being destroyed over time or still awaiting discovery.

One recent popular history of the Ancient Near East by Marc Van De Mierop, in his discussion of chronology and dating, does not mention the Sothic cycle at all, and believes that the bulk of historians nowadays would consider that it is not possible to put forward exact dates earlier than the 8th century BCE. &lt;ref&gt;Marc Van De Mieroop ''A History of the Ancient Near East, ca. 3000–323 B.C.''&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Some have recently claimed that the [[Theran eruption]] marks the beginning of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth dynasty]] due to Theran ash and pumice discoveries in the ruins of [[Avaris]] in layers that mark the end of the Hyksos era{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}. Because the evidence of [[dendrochronology|dendrochronologists]] indicates the eruption took place in 1626 BC, this has been taken to indicate that dating by the Sothic cycle is off by 50–80 years at the outset of the 18th dynasty{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}. Claims that the Thera eruption is the subject of the [[Tempest Stele]] of [[Ahmose I]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ritner|first=Robert K|author2=Moeller, Nadine |title=The Ahmose ‘Tempest Stela’, Thera and Comparative Chronology|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|date=2014|volume=73|issue=1|pages=1–19|doi=10.1086/675069|jstor=10.1086/675069}}&lt;/ref&gt;  have been disputed by writers such as [[Peter James (historian)|Peter James]].&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Centuries of Darkness'' (London, 1991: [http://www.centuries.co.uk/index.htm]).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technological determinism''' is a [[reductionism|reductionist]] [[theory]] that assumes that a society's [[technology]] [[determinism|determines]] the development of its social structure and cultural values. Technological determinism tries to understand how technology has had an impact on human action and thought. Changes in technology are the primary source for changes in society. The term is believed to have originated from [[Thorstein Veblen]] (1857–1929), an American sociologist and economist. The most radical technological determinist in the United States in the 20th century was most likely [[Clarence Ayres]] who was a follower of [[Thorstein Veblen]] and [[John Dewey]]. [[William Ogburn]] was also known for his radical technological determinism.

The first major elaboration of a technological determinist view of socioeconomic development came from the German philosopher and economist [[Karl Marx]], whose theoretical framework was grounded in the perspective that changes in technology, and specifically [[Productive forces|productive technology]], are the primary influence on human social relations and organizational structure, and that social relations and cultural practices ultimately revolve around the technological and economic base of a given society. Marx's position has become embedded in contemporary society, where the idea that fast-changing technologies alter human lives is all-pervasive.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith &amp; Marx|first= Merrit Roe &amp; Leo |title= Does Technology Drive History? The Dilemma of Technological Determinism|publisher= The MIT Press|date=June 1994|isbn= 978-0262691673}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although many authors attribute a technologically determined view of human history to Marx's insights, not all Marxists are technological determinists, and some authors question the extent to which Marx himself was a determinist. Furthermore, there are multiple forms of technological determinism.&lt;ref name="Karl Marx and the Three Faces of Technological Determinism, 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bimber|first=Bruce|title=Karl Marx and the Three Faces of Technological Determinism|journal=Social Studies of Science|date=May 1990|volume=20|issue=2|pages=333–351|doi=10.1177/030631290020002006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}
The term is believed to have been coined by Thorstein Veblen (1857–1929), an American social scientist. Veblen's contemporary, popular historian Charles A. Beard, provided this apt determinist image, "Technology marches in seven-league boots from one ruthless, revolutionary conquest to another, tearing down old factories and industries, flinging up new processes with terrifying rapidity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beard|first=Charles A.|title=Time, Technology, and the Creative Spirit in Political Science|journal=The American Political Science Review|date=February 1927|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–11|doi=10.2307/1945535|jstor=1945535}}&lt;/ref&gt; As to the meaning, it is described as the ascription to machines of "powers" that they do not have.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Technology Drive History?: The Dilemma of Technological Determinism|last=Smith|first=Merritt|last2=Marx|first2=Leo|publisher=MIT Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0262193474|location=Cambridge|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veblen, for instance, asserted that "the machine throws out anthropomorphic habits of thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Worldly Philosophers: The Lives, Times And Ideas Of The Great Economic Thinkers|last=Heilbroner|first=Robert|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1999|isbn=978-0684862149|location=New York|pages=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the case of Karl Marx who expected that the construction of the railway in India would dissolve the caste system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The general idea, according to [[Robert Heilbroner]], is that technology, by way of its machines, can cause historical change by changing the material conditions of human existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Knowing Machines: Essays on Technical Change|last=MacKenzie|first=Donald|publisher=MIT Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0262631884|location=Cambridge|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most radical technological determinists was a man named [[Clarence Edwin Ayres|Clarence Ayres]], who was a follower of Veblen's theory in the 20th century. Ayers is best known for developing economic philosophies, but he also worked closely with Veblen who coined the technological determinism theory.  He often times talked about the struggle between technology and ceremonial structure. One of his most notable theories involved the concept of "technological drag" where he explains technology as a self-generating process and institutions as ceremonial and this notion creates a technological over-determinism in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Limits to Economic Theory|last=Mulberg|first=Jonathan|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|isbn=978-0415123860|location=London|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Explanation ==
Technological determinism seeks to show technical developments, media, or technology as a whole, as the key mover in history and social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kunz|first=William M.|title=Culture Conglomerates: Consolidation in the Motion Picture and Television Industries|year=2006|publisher=Publisher: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|isbn=978-0742540668|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a theory subscribed by "hyperglobalist" who claims that as a consequence of the wide availability of technology, accelerated globalization is inevitable. Therefore, technological development and innovation become the principal motor of social, economic or political change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global politics|last=Macmillan.|first=Palgrave|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137349262|oclc=979008143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strict adherents to technological determinism do not believe the influence of technology differs based on how much a technology is or can be used.  Instead of considering technology as part of a larger spectrum of human activity, technological determinism sees technology as the basis for all human activity.

Technological determinism has been summarized as 'The belief in technology as a key governing force in society ...' ([[Merritt Roe Smith]]). 'The idea that technological development determines social change ...' (Bruce Bimber). It changes the way people think and how they interact with others and can be described as '...a three-word logical proposition: "Technology determines history"' ([[Rosalind Williams]]) &lt;!--[thanks to Brian Martin: http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/96BRmetascience.html"].--&gt;. It is, '... the belief that social progress is driven by technological innovation, which in turn follows an "inevitable" course.' ([[Michael L. Smith]]). This 'idea of progress' or 'doctrine of progress' is centralised around the idea that social problems can be solved by technological advancement, and this is the way that society moves forward. Technological determinists believe that "'You can't stop progress', implying that we are unable to control technology" ([[Lelia Green]]). This suggests that we are somewhat powerless and society allows technology to drive social changes because, "societies fail to be aware of the alternatives to the values embedded in it [technology]" ([[Merritt Roe Smith]]).

Technological determinism has been defined as an approach that identifies technology, or technological advances, as the central causal element in processes of social change (Croteau and Hoynes). As a technology is stabilized, its design tends to dictate users' behaviors, consequently diminishing human agency. This stance however ignores the social and cultural circumstances in which the technology was developed. Sociologist Claude Fischer (1992) characterized the most prominent forms of technological determinism as "billiard ball" approaches, in which technology is seen as an external force introduced into a social situation, producing a series of ricochet effects.&lt;ref&gt;Croteau and Hoynes, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than acknowledging that a society or culture interacts with and even shapes the technologies that are used, a technological determinist view holds that "the uses made of technology are largely determined by the structure of the technology itself, that is, that its functions follow from its form" ([[Neil Postman]]). However, this is not to be confused with [[Daniel Chandler]]'s "inevitability thesis", which states that once a technology is introduced into a culture that what follows is the inevitable development of that technology.

For example, we could examine why Romance Novels have become so dominant in our society compared to other forms of novels like the Detective or Western novel. We might say that it was because of the invention of the perfect binding system developed by publishers. This was where glue was used instead of the time-consuming and very costly process of binding books by sewing in separate signatures. This meant that these books could be mass-produced for the wider public. We would not be able to have mass literacy without mass production.{{clarify|Society could mass produce books on any theme. This does not explain how Romance became more dominant than Detective or Western novels. Its relevance to the idea of Technological Determinism is dubious, as well.|date=May 2014}} This example is closely related to [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s belief that print helped produce the [[nation state]]. This moved society on from an oral culture to a literate culture but also introduced a capitalist society where there was clear class distinction and individualism. As Postman maintains  &lt;!-- This is a poor example of technological determinism --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The printing press, the computer, and television are not therefore simply machines which convey information. They are metaphors through which we conceptualize reality in one way or another. They will classify the world for us, sequence it, frame it, enlarge it, reduce it, argue a case for what it is like. Through these media metaphors, we do not see the world as it is. We see it as our coding systems are. Such is the power of the form of information.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Teaching as a Conserving Activity (1979), p. 39)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Hard and soft determinism ==

In examining [[determinism]], '''hard determinism''' can be contrasted with '''soft determinism'''. A [[compatibilist]] says that it is possible for [[free will]] and determinism to exist in the world together, while an [[incompatibilist]] would say that they can not and there must be one or the other.  Those who support [[determinism]] can be further divided.

'''''Hard determinists''''' would view technology as developing independent from social concerns. They would say that technology creates a set of powerful forces acting to regulate our social activity and its meaning.  According to this view of determinism we organize ourselves to meet the needs of technology and the outcome of this organization is beyond our control or we do not have the freedom to make a choice regarding the outcome (autonomous technology). The 20th century French philosopher and social theorist [[Jacques Ellul]] could be said to be a hard determinist and proponent of autonomous technique (technology).  In his 1954 work ''[[:fr:La Technique ou l'Enjeu du siècle|The Technological Society]]'', Ellul essentially posits that technology, by virtue of its power through efficiency, determines which social aspects are best suited for its own development through a process of natural selection.  A social system's values, morals, philosophy etc. that are most conducive to the advancement of technology allow that social system to enhance its power and spread at the expense of those social systems whose values, morals, philosophy etc. are less promoting of technology.  [[Theodore J. Kaczynski]] (the Unabomber) can be essentially thought of as a hard determinist.  According to Kaczynski, "objective" material factors in the human environment are the principal determining factors in the evolution of social systems. While geography, climate, and other "natural" factors largely determined the parameters of social conditions for most of human history, technology has recently become the dominant objective factor (largely due to forces unleashed by the industrial revolution) and it has been the principal objective and determining factor.

'''''Soft determinism''''', as the name suggests, is a more passive view of the way technology interacts with socio-political situations.  Soft determinists still subscribe to the fact that technology is the guiding force in our evolution, but would maintain that we have a ''chance'' to make decisions regarding the outcomes of a situation.  This is not to say that free will exists, but that the possibility for us to ''roll the dice'' and see what the outcome is exists. A slightly different variant of soft determinism is the 1922 technology-driven theory of social change proposed by [[William Fielding Ogburn]], in which society must adjust to the consequences of major inventions, but often does so only after a period of [[cultural lag]].&lt;!-- This section needs a reference --&gt;

== Technology as neutral ==
Individuals who consider technology as neutral see technology as neither good nor bad and what matters are the ways in which we use technology.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won't Save Us or the Environment''], "The Myth of Value-Neutrality", pp. 235-241, New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a neutral viewpoint is, "guns are neutral and its up to how we use them whether it would be 'good or bad'" (Green, 2001). Mackenzie and Wajcman&lt;ref&gt;(1997)&lt;/ref&gt; believe that technology is neutral only if it's never been used before, or if no one knows what it is going to be used for (Green, 2001). In effect, guns would be classified as neutral if and only if society were none the wiser of their existence and functionality (Green, 2001). Obviously, such a society is non-existent and once becoming knowledgeable about technology, the society is drawn into a social progression where nothing is 'neutral about society' (Green). According to [[Lelia Green]], if one believes technology is neutral, one would disregard the cultural and social conditions that technology has produced (Green, 2001). This view is also referred to as technological instrumentalism.

In what is often considered a definitive reflection on the topic, the historian [[Melvin Kranzberg]] famously wrote in the first of his [[Kranzberg's laws of technology|six laws of technology]]: "Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral."

== Criticism ==
Scepticism about technological determinism emerged alongside increased pessimism about techno-science in the mid-20th century, in particular around the use of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] in the production of [[nuclear weapons]], [[Nazi human experimentation]] during [[World War II]], and the problems of economic development in the [[Third World]]. As a direct consequence, desire for greater control of the course of development of technology gave rise to disenchantment with the model of technological determinism in academia.

Modern theorists of technology and society no longer consider technological determinism to be a very accurate view of the way in which we interact with technology, even though determinist assumptions and language fairly saturate the writings of many boosters of technology, the business pages of many popular magazines, and much reporting on technology {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.  Instead, research in [[science and technology studies]], [[social construction of technology]] and related fields have emphasised more nuanced views that resist easy causal formulations. They emphasise that "The relationship between technology and society cannot be reduced to a simplistic cause-and-effect formula. It is, rather, an 'intertwining'", whereby technology does not determine but "operates, and are operated upon in a complex social field" (Murphie and Potts).

In his article "Subversive Rationalization: Technology, Power and Democracy with Technology," [[Andrew Feenberg]] argues that technological determinism is not a very well founded concept by illustrating that two of the founding theses of determinism are easily questionable and in doing so calls for what he calls [[democratic rationalization]] ([[Feenberg]] 210–212).

Prominent opposition to technologically determinist thinking has emerged within work on the [[social construction of technology]] (SCOT). SCOT research, such as that of Mackenzie and Wajcman (1997) argues that the path of innovation and its social consequences are strongly, if not entirely shaped by society itself through the influence of culture, politics, economic arrangements, regulatory mechanisms and the like. In its strongest form, verging on [[social determinism]], "What matters is not the technology itself, but the social or economic system in which it is embedded" ([[Langdon Winner]]).

In his influential but contested (see Woolgar and Cooper, 1999) article "Do Artifacts Have Politics?", [[Langdon Winner]] illustrates not a form of determinism but the various sources of the politics of technologies. Those politics can stem from the intentions of the designer and the culture of the society in which a technology emerges or can stem from the technology itself, a "practical necessity" for it to function. For instance, New York City urban planner [[Robert Moses]] is purported to have built Long Island's parkway tunnels too low for buses to pass in order to keep minorities away from the island's beaches, an example of externally inscribed politics. On the other hand, an authoritarian command-and-control structure is a practical necessity of a nuclear power plant if radioactive waste is not to fall into the wrong hands. As such, Winner neither succumbs to technological determinism nor social determinism. The source of a technology's politics is determined only by carefully examining its features and history.

Although "The deterministic model of technology is widely propagated in society" ([[Sarah Miller]]), it has also been widely questioned by scholars. [[Lelia Green]] explains that, "When technology was perceived as being outside society, it made sense to talk about technology as neutral". Yet, this idea fails to take into account that culture is not fixed and society is dynamic. When "Technology is implicated in social processes, there is nothing neutral about society" ([[Lelia Green]]). This confirms one of the major problems with "technological determinism and the resulting denial of human responsibility for change. There is a loss of human involvement that shape technology and society" ([[Sarah Miller]]).

Another conflicting idea is that of [[technological somnambulism]], a term coined by Winner in his essay "Technology as Forms of Life".  Winner wonders whether or not we are simply ''sleepwalking'' through our existence with little concern or knowledge as to how we truly interact with technology. In this view, it is still possible for us to wake up and once again take control of the direction in which we are traveling (Winner 104). However, it requires society to adopt [[Ralph Schroeder]]'s claim that, "users don't just passively consume technology, but actively transform it".

In opposition to technological determinism are those who subscribe to the belief of [[social determinism]] and [[postmodernism]]. Social determinists believe that social circumstances alone select which technologies are adopted, with the result that no technology can be considered "inevitable" solely on its own merits. Technology and culture are not neutral and when knowledge comes into the equation, technology becomes implicated in social processes. The knowledge of how to create and enhance technology, and of how to use technology is socially bound knowledge. Postmodernists take another view, suggesting that what is right or wrong is dependent on circumstance. They believe technological change can have implications on the past, present and future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Leila|year=2001|title=Technoculture: From Alphabet to Cybersex|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location=Crows Nest|page=15|isbn=9781865080482}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they believe technological change is influenced by changes in government policy, society and culture, they consider the notion of change to be a paradox, since change is constant.

Media and cultural studies theorist [[Brian Winston]], in response to technological determinism, developed a model for the emergence of new technologies which is centered on the [[Law of the suppression of radical potential]]. In two of his books – ''Technologies of Seeing: Photography, Cinematography and Television'' (1997) and ''Media Technology and Society'' (1998) – Winston applied this model to show how technologies evolve over time, and how their 'invention' is mediated and controlled by society and societal factors which suppress the radical potential of a given technology.

==The stirrup==
{{main|Great Stirrup Controversy}}

One continued argument for technological determinism is centered on the stirrup and its impact on the creation of [[feudalism]] in Europe in the late 8th century/early 9th century. [[Lynn White]] is credited with first drawing this parallel between feudalism and the stirrup in his book ''Medieval Technology and Social Change'', stating that as "it made possible mounted [[shock combat]]", the new form of war made the soldier that much more efficient in supporting feudal townships (White, 2). According to White, the superiority of the stirrup in combat was found in the mechanics of the lance charge: "The stirrup made possible- though it did not demand- a vastly more effective mode of attack: now the rider could law his lance at rest, held between the upper arm and the body, and make at his foe, delivering the blow not with his muscles but with the combined weight of himself and his charging stallion (White, 2)." White draws from a large research base, particularly [[Heinrich Brunner]]'s "Der Reiterdienst und die Anfänge des Lehnwesens" in substantiating his claim of the emergence of feudalism. In focusing on the evolution of warfare, particularly that of cavalry in connection with [[Charles Martel]]'s "diversion of a considerable part of the Church's vast military riches...from infantry to cavalry", White draws from Brunner's research and identifies the stirrup as the underlying cause for such a shift in military division and the subsequent emergence of feudalism (White, 4). Under the new brand of warfare garnered from the stirrup, White implicitly argues in favor of technological determinism as the vehicle by which feudalism was created.

Though an accomplished work, White's ''Medieval Technology and Social Change'' has since come under heavy scrutiny and condemnation. The most volatile critics of White's argument at the time of its publication, P.H. Sawyer and R.H. Hilton, call the work as a whole "a misleading adventurist cast to old-fashioned platitudes with a chain of obscure and dubious deductions from scanty evidence about the progress of technology (Sawyer and Hilton, 90)." They further condemn his methods and, by association, the validity of technological determinism: "Had Mr. White been prepared to accept the view that the English and Norman methods of fighting were not so very different in the eleventh century, he would have made the weakness of his argument less obvious, but the fundamental failure would remain: the stirrup cannot alone explain the changes it made possible (Sawyer and Hilton, 91)." For Sawyer and Hilton, though the stirrup may be useful in the implementation of feudalism, it cannot be credited for the creation of feudalism alone.

Despite the scathing review of White's claims, the technological determinist aspect of the stirrup is still in debate. [[Alex Roland]], author of "Once More into the Stirrups; Lynne White Jr, Medieval Technology and Social Change", provides an intermediary stance: not necessarily lauding White's claims, but providing a little defense against Sawyer and Hilton's allegations of gross intellectual negligence. Roland views White's focus on technology to be the most relevant and important aspect of ''Medieval Technology and Social Change'' rather than the particulars of its execution: "But can these many virtues, can this utility for historians of technology, outweigh the most fundamental standards of the profession? Can historians of technology continue to read and assign a book that is, in the words of a recent critic, "shot through with over-simplification, with a progression of false connexions between cause and effect, and with evidence presented selectively to fit with [White's] own pre-conceived ideas"? The answer, I think, is yes, at least a qualified yes (Roland, 574-575)." Objectively, Roland claims ''Medieval Technology and Social Change'' a variable success, at least as "Most of White's argument stands... the rest has sparked useful lines of research (Roland, 584)." This acceptance of technological determinism is ambiguous at best, neither fully supporting the theory at large nor denouncing it, rather placing the construct firmly in the realm of the theoretical. Roland neither views technological determinism as completely dominant over history nor completely absent as well; in accordance with the above criterion of technological determinist structure, would Roland be classified as a "soft determinist".

==Notable technological determinists ==

[[Thomas L. Friedman]], American journalist, columnist and author, admits to being a technological determinist in his book ''The World is Flat''.

Futurist [[Raymond Kurzweil]]'s theories about a [[technological singularity]] follow a technologically deterministic view of history.

Some interpret Karl Marx as advocating technological determinism, with such statements as "The Handmill gives you society with the feudal lord: the [[steam-mill]], society with the industrial capitalist" (''The Poverty of Philosophy,'' 1847), but others argue that Marx was not a determinist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/tecdet/tdet02.html Technological or Media Determinism], Daniel Chandler&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological determinist Walter Ong reviews the societal transition from an oral culture to a written culture in his work "Orality and Literacy." He asserts that this particular development is attributable to the use of new technologies of literacy (particularly print and writing,) to communicate thoughts which could previously only be verbalized. He furthers this  argument by claiming that writing is purely context dependent as it is a "secondary modelling system" (8). Reliant upon the earlier primary system of spoken language, writing manipulates the potential of language as it depends purely upon the visual sense to communicate the intended information. Furthermore, the rather stagnant technology of literacy distinctly limits the usage and influence of knowledge, it unquestionably effects the evolution of society. In fact, Ong asserts that "more than any other single invention, writing has transformed human consciousness" (Ong 1982: 78).

== Media determinism as a form of technological determinism ==

Media determinism is a form of technological determinism, a philosophical and sociological position which posits the power of the media to impact society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regent.edu/acad/schcom/rojc/mdic/define.html ''Media Determinism in Cyberspace''], Regent University&lt;/ref&gt; Two foundational media determinists are the Canadian scholars [[Harold Innis]] and [[Marshall McLuhan]]. One of the best examples of technological determinism in media theory is Marshall McLuhan's theory "[[the medium is the message]]" and the ideas of his mentor Harold Adams Innis. Both these Canadian theorists saw media as the essence of civilization. The association of different media with particular mental consequences by McLuhan and others can be seen as related to technological determinism. It is this variety of determinism that is referred to as media determinism. According to McLuhan, there is an association between communications media/technology and language; similarly, [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]] argues that language shapes our perception of thinking ([[linguistic determinism]]). For McLuhan, media is a more powerful and explicit determinant than is the more general concept of language. McLuhan was not necessarily a hard determinist. As a more moderate version of media determinism, he proposed that our use of particular media may have subtle influences on us, but more importantly, it is the social context of use that is crucial.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://beforebefore.net/80f/s11/media/mcluhan.pdf |last=McLuhan|first=Marshall | title=Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man |format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324065603/http://beforebefore.net/80f/s11/media/mcluhan.pdf|archivedate= March 24, 2012|deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Media ecology]].
Media determinism is a form of the popular dominant theory of the relationship between [[technology and society]]. In a determinist view, technology takes on an active life of its own and is seen be as a driver of social phenomena. Innis believed that the social, cultural, political, and economic developments of each historical period can be related directly to the technology of the means of mass communication of that period. In this sense, like Dr. Frankenstein's monster, technology itself appears to be alive, or at least capable of shaping human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/1789051 |last=Hist|first=Martin |title= One tweet does not a revolution make: Technological determinism, media and social change|publisher= Deakin University}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been increasingly subject to critical review by scholars. For example, scholar [[Raymond Williams]], criticizes media determinism and rather believes social movements define technological and media processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams|first=Raymond |title=Television: Technology and Cultural Form|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PXSLD8j0kb8C&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=Determination+is+a+real+social+process,+but+never#v=onepage&amp;q=Determination%20is%20a%20real%20social%20process%2C%20but%20never&amp;f=false |accessdate=28 May 2013 |year=1974 |publisher=Routledge |location=London and New York |isbn=978-0-415-31456-5 |page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to communications media, audience determinism is a viewpoint opposed to media determinism. This is described as instead of media being presented as doing things to people; the stress is on the way people do things with media. Individuals need to be aware that the term "deterministic" is a negative one for many social scientists and modern sociologists; in particular they often use the word as a term of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/tecdet/tecdet.html |last=Chandler| first= Daniel | title=Technological or Media Determinism |date=18 September 1995|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421235047/http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/tecdet/tecdet.html|archivedate=April 21, 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technology society and life''' or '''technology and culture''' refers to cyclical co-dependence, co-influence, and co-production of [[technology]] and [[society]] upon the other (technology upon culture, and vice versa). This synergistic relationship occurred from the dawn of humankind, with the invention of simple tools and continues into modern technologies such as the [[printing press]] and [[computer]]s. The academic discipline studying the impacts of science, technology, and society, and vice versa is called [[science and technology studies]].

==Pre-historical==
The importance of [[stone tool]]s, circa 2.5 million years ago, is considered fundamental in the human development in the [[hunting hypothesis]].

Primatologist, [[Richard Wrangham]], theorizes that the [[control of fire by early humans]] and the associated development of [[cooking]] was the spark that radically changed human evolution.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Texts such as ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' suggest that early advances in plant agriculture and husbandry fundamentally shifted the way that collective groups of individuals, and eventually societies, developed.

==Modern examples and effects==
Technology has become a huge part in society and day-to-day life. When societies know more about the development in a technology, they become able to take advantage of it. When an innovation achieves a certain point after it has been presented and promoted, this technology becomes part of the society.The use of technology in education provides students with technology literacy, information literacy, capacity for life-long learning and other skills necessary for the 21st century workplace. &lt;ref name=Puricelli&gt;{{harv|Puricelli|2011|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Digital technology]] has entered each process and activity made by the [[social system]]. In fact, it constructed another worldwide [[communication system]] in addition to its origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rückriem|2009|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1982 study by ''[[The New York Times]]'' described a technology assessment study by the [[Institute for the Future]], "peering into the future of an electronic world." The study focused on the emerging videotex industry, formed by the marriage of two older technologies, communications and computing. It estimated that 40 percent of American households will have two-way videotex service by the end of the century. By comparison, it took television 16 years to penetrate 90 percent of households from the time commercial service was begun.

Since the creation of [[computer]]s achieved an entire better approach to transmit and store [[data]]. Digital technology became commonly used for downloading music and watching movies at home either by [[DVD]]s or purchasing it online.
Digital music records are not quite the same as traditional recording media. Obviously, because [[digital media|digital]] ones are reproducible, portable and free.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Katz|2010|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several states started to implement education technology in schools, universities and colleges. According to the statistics, in the early beginnings of 1990s the use of Internet in schools was ,on average, 2-3%. Continuously, by the end of 1990s the evolution of technology increases rapidly and reaches to 60%, and by the year of 2008 nearly 100% of schools use Internet on educational form. According to ISTE researchers, technological improvements can lead to numerous achievements in classrooms. E-learning system, collaboration of students on project based learning, and technological skills for future results in motivation of students. 

Although these previous examples only show a few of the positive aspects of technology in society, there are negative side effects as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Lynden|first1 = Burke|title = Generation Y Heavily Dependent On Technology, Promotes Laziness|url = http://www.thejambar.com/generation-y-heavily-dependent-on-technology-promotes-laziness/|website = The Jambar|accessdate = 28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this virtual realm, social media platforms such as [[Instagram]], [[Instagram|Facebook]], and [[Snapchat]] have altered the way [[Millennials|Generation Y culture]] is understanding the world and thus how they view themselves. In recent years, there has been more research on the development of social media depression in users of sites like these. "Facebook Depression" is when users are so affected by their friends' posts and lives that their own jealousy depletes their sense of self-worth. They compare themselves to the posts made by their peers and feel unworthy or monotonous because they feel like their lives are not nearly as exciting as the lives of others.&lt;ref name=Puricelli/&gt;

Another instance of the negative effects of technology in society, is how quickly it is pushing younger generations into maturity. With the world at their fingertips, children can learn anything they wish to. But with the uncensored sources from the [[internet]], without proper supervision, children can be exposed to explicit material at inappropriate ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woollaston|first1=Victoria|title=Kids ARE growing up faster today - and it's all down to technology|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2834559/Kids-growing-faster-today-s-technology-Facebook-mobile-phones-causing-young-people-mature-quickly-poll-reveals.html|accessdate=28 October 2015|agency=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes in the forms of premature interests in experimenting with makeup or opening an email account or social media page—all of which can become a window for predators and other dangerous entities that threaten a child's innocence. Technology has a serious effect on youth's health. The overuse of technology is said to be associated with sleep deprivation which is linked to obesity and poor academic performance in the lives of adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Saudi med J. 2016 pages 436-439&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics and technological development==
[[File:Doel Kerncentrale.JPG|thumb|Nuclear reactor, [[Doel]], [[Belgium]]]]

In ancient history, [[economics]] began when spontaneous exchange of goods and services was replaced over time by deliberate trade structures. Makers of arrowheads, for example, might have realized they could do better by concentrating on making arrowheads and barter for other needs. Regardless of goods and services bartered, some amount of technology was involved&amp;mdash;if no more than in the making of shell and bead jewelry. Even the shaman's potions and sacred objects can be said to have involved some technology. So, from the very beginnings, technology can be said to have spurred the development of more elaborate economies.Technology is seen as primary source in economic development.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Andrey Korotayev]], Artemy Malkov, and Daria Khaltourina. [https://www.academia.edu/35443515/Introduction_to_Social_Macrodynamics_Compact_Macromodels_of_the_World_System_Growth._Moscow_KomKniga_2006 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth''] {{ISBN|5-484-00414-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology advancement and economic growth are related to each other.The level of technology is important to determine the economic growth.It is the technological process which keeps the economy moving.

In the modern world, superior technologies, resources, geography, and history give rise to robust economies; and in a well-functioning, robust economy, economic excess naturally flows into greater use of technology. Moreover, because technology is such an inseparable part of human society, especially in its economic aspects, funding sources for (new) technological endeavors are virtually illimitable. However, while in the beginning, technological investment involved little more than the time, efforts, and skills of one or a few men, today, such investment may involve the collective labor and skills of many millions.

===Funding===
Consequently, the sources of funding for large technological efforts have dramatically narrowed, since few have ready access to the collective labor of a whole society, or even a large part. It is conventional to divide up funding sources into governmental (involving whole, or nearly whole, social [[Organization|enterprises]]) and private (involving more limited, but generally more sharply focused) business or individual enterprises.

====Government funding for new technology====
The government is a major contributor to the development of new technology in many ways. In the United States alone, many government agencies specifically invest billions of dollars in new technology.

[In 1980, the UK government invested just over six million pounds in a four-year program, later extended to six years, called the [[Microelectronics Education Programme]] (MEP), which was intended to give every school in Britain at least one computer, software, training materials, and extensive teacher training. Similar programs have been instituted by governments around the world.]

Technology has frequently been driven by the military, with many modern applications developed for the military before they were adapted for civilian use. However, this has always been a two-way flow, with industry often developing and adopting a technology only later adopted by the military.

Entire government agencies are specifically dedicated to research, such as America's [[National Science Foundation]], the United Kingdom's [[List of UK government scientific research institutes|scientific research institutes]], America's [[Small Business Innovation Research|Small Business Innovative Research]] effort. Many other government agencies dedicate a major portion of their budget to research and development.

====Private funding====
[[Research and development]] is one of the smallest areas of investments made by corporations toward new and innovative technology.
&lt;!--source needed--&gt;

Many foundations and other nonprofit organizations contribute to the development of technology. In the [[OECD]], about two-thirds of [[research and development]] in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 98 percent and 10 percent, respectively, by [[University|universities]] and government. But in poorer countries such as [[Portugal]] and [[Mexico]] the industry contribution is significantly less. The U.S. government spends more than other countries on military research and development, although the proportion has fallen from about 30 percent in the 1980s to less than 10 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723051956/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf |date=July 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 founding of [[Kickstarter]] allows individuals to receive funding via [[crowdsourcing]] for many technology related products including both new physical creations as well as documentaries, films, and webseries that focus on [[technology management]]. This circumvents the corporate or government oversight most inventors and artists struggle against but leaves the accountability of the project completely with the individual receiving the funds.

===Other economic considerations===
* [[Appropriate technology]], sometimes called "intermediate" technology, more of [[Index of economics articles|an economics concern]], refers to compromises between central and expensive technologies of [[Developed country|developed nations]] and those that [[Developing country|developing nations]] find most effective to deploy given an excess of labour and scarcity of cash.
*[[Persuasive technology|Persuasion technology]]: In [[economics]], definitions or assumptions of progress or [[economic growth|growth]] are often related to one or more assumptions about technology's economic influence. Challenging prevailing assumptions about technology and its usefulness has led to alternative ideas like [[uneconomic growth]] or [[Quality of life|measuring well-being]]. These, and economics itself, can often be described as technologies, specifically, as persuasion technology.

==Sociological factors and effects==
{{See also|Social construction of technology}}

===Values===
The implementation of technology influences the [[Value (ethics)#Personal and cultural values|values]] of a society by changing expectations and realities. The implementation of technology is also influenced by values. There are (at least) three major, interrelated values that inform, and are informed by, technological innovations:
*[[Mechanism (philosophy)|Mechanistic world view]]: Viewing the universe as a collection of parts (like a machine), that can be individually analyzed and understood.&lt;ref name = McGinn&gt;{{harv|McGinn|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a form of [[reductionism]] that is rare nowadays. However, the "neo-mechanistic world view" holds that nothing in the universe cannot be understood by the human intellect. Also, while all things are greater than the sum of their parts (e.g., even if we consider nothing more than the information involved in their combination), in principle, even this excess must eventually be understood by human intelligence. That is, no [[Divinity|divine]] or [[Vitalism|vital]] principle or essence is involved.
*[[Efficiency (economics)|Efficiency]]: A value, originally applied only to machines, but now applied to all aspects of society, so that each element is expected to attain a higher and higher percentage of its maximal possible performance, output, or ability.
*Social [[progress]]: The belief that there is such a thing as social progress, and that, in the main, it is beneficent. Before the [[Industrial Revolution]], and the subsequent explosion of technology, almost all societies believed in a [[cyclical theory]] of social movement and, indeed, of all history and the universe. This was, obviously, based on the cyclicity of the seasons, and an agricultural economy's and society's strong ties to that cyclicity. Since much of the world is closer to their agricultural roots, they are still much more amenable to cyclicity than progress in history. This may be seen, for example, in Prabhat Rainjan Sarkar's modern social cycles theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metafuture.org/sarkar/prabhat.htm | title=Prabhat rainjan sarkar's social cycles, world unity and peace; Renaissance 2000 honoring Sarkar's 75th Anniversary, LA 1 | work=Metafuture.org | accessdate=July 6, 2016 | author=Galtung, Johan}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a more westernized version of social cyclicity, see ''Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069'' (Paperback) by Neil Howe and William Strauss; Harper Perennial; Reprint edition (September 30, 1992); {{ISBN|0-688-11912-3}}, and subsequent books by these authors.

====Institutions and groups====
Technology often enables organizational and bureaucratic group structures that otherwise and heretofore were simply not possible. Examples of this might include:
*The rise of very large organizations: e.g., governments, the military, health and social welfare institutions, supranational corporations.
*The commercialization of leisure: sports events, products, etc. (McGinn)
*The almost instantaneous dispersal of information (especially news) and entertainment around the world.

===International===
Technology enables greater knowledge of international issues, values, and cultures. Due mostly to mass transportation and mass media, the world seems to be a much smaller place, due to the following:{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}
*Globalization of ideas
*Embeddedness of values
*Population growth and control

==Environment==
{{Main article|Environmental technology}}
Technology provides an understanding, and an appreciation for the world around us.

Most modern technological processes produce unwanted by products in addition to the desired products, which is known as industrial waste and pollution. While most material waste is re-used in the industrial process, many forms are released into the environment, with negative environmental side effects, such as pollution and lack of sustainability. Different social and political systems establish different balances between the value they place on additional goods versus the disvalues of waste products and pollution. Some technologies are designed specifically with the environment in mind, but most are designed first for economic or ergonomic effects. Historically, the value of a clean environment and more efficient productive processes has been the result of an increase in the wealth of society, because once people are able to provide for their basic needs, they are able to focus on less tangible goods such as clean air and water.

The effects of technology on the environment are both obvious and subtle. The more obvious effects include the depletion of nonrenewable natural resources (such as petroleum, coal, ores), and the added [[pollution]] of air, water, and land. The more subtle effects include debates over long-term effects (e.g., global warming, deforestation, natural habitat destruction, coastal wetland loss.)

Each wave of technology creates a set of waste previously unknown by humans: [[toxic waste]], [[radioactive waste]], [[electronic waste]].

One of the main problems is the lack of an effective way to remove these pollutants on a large scale expediently. In nature, organisms "recycle" the wastes of other organisms, for example, plants produce oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis, oxygen-breathing organisms use oxygen to metabolize food, producing carbon dioxide as a by-product, which plants use in a process to make sugar, with oxygen as a waste in the first place. No such mechanism exists for the removal of technological wastes.

==Construction and shaping==

===Choice===
Society also controls technology through the choices it makes. These choices not only include consumer demands; they also include:
*the channels of distribution, how do products go from raw materials to consumption to disposal;
*the cultural beliefs regarding style, freedom of choice, consumerism, materialism, etc.;
*the economic values we place on the environment, individual wealth, government control, capitalism, etc.

According to Williams and Edge,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Williams|Edge|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; the construction and shaping of technology includes the concept of choice (and not necessarily conscious choice). Choice is inherent in both the design of individual artifacts and systems, and in the making of those artifacts and systems.

The idea here is that a single technology may not emerge from the unfolding of a predetermined logic or a single determinant, technology could be a garden of forking paths, with different paths potentially leading to different technological outcomes. This is a position that has been developed in detail by [[Judy Wajcman]]. Therefore, choices could have differing implications for society and for particular social groups.

===Autonomous technology===
In one line of thought, technology develops autonomously, in other words, technology seems to feed on itself, moving forward with a force irresistible by humans. To these individuals, technology is "inherently dynamic and self-augmenting."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McGinn|1991|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Ellul]] is one proponent of the irresistibleness of technology to humans. He espouses the idea that humanity cannot resist the temptation of expanding our knowledge and our technological abilities. However, he does not believe that this seeming autonomy of technology is inherent. But the perceived autonomy is because humans do not adequately consider the responsibility that is inherent in technological processes.

[[Langdon Winner]] critiques the idea that [[Radovan Richta|technological evolution]] is essentially beyond the control of individuals or society in his book Autonomous Technology. He argues instead that the apparent autonomy of technology is a result of "technological somnambulism," the tendency of people to uncritically and unreflectively embrace and utilize new technologies without regard for their broader social and political effects.

===Government===
Individuals rely on governmental assistance to control the side effects and negative consequences of technology.
*Supposed independence of government. An assumption commonly made about the government is that their governance role is neutral or independent. However, some argue that governing is a political process, so government will be influenced by political winds of influence. In addition, because government provides much of the funding for technological research and development, it has a vested interest in certain outcomes. Other point out that the world's biggest ecological disasters, such as the [[Aral Sea]], [[Chernobyl]], and [[Lake Karachay]] have been caused by government projects, which are not accountable to consumers.
*Liability. One means for controlling technology is to place responsibility for the harm with the agent causing the harm. Government can allow more or less legal liability to fall to the organizations or individuals responsible for damages.
*Legislation. A source of controversy is the role of industry versus that of government in maintaining a clean environment. While it is generally agreed that industry needs to be held responsible when pollution harms other people, there is disagreement over whether this should be prevented by legislation or civil courts, and whether ecological systems as such should be protected from harm by governments.

Recently, the social shaping of technology has had new influence in the fields of [[E-Science|e-science]] and [[e-social science]] in the United Kingdom, which has made centers focusing on the social shaping of [[Science and technology studies|science and technology]] a central part of their funding programs.

'''''The Arctic Home in the Vedas''''' is a book on the origin of [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Aryanic People]] by [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], a mathematician turned [[astronomer]], historian, journalist, philosopher and political leader of India. It propounded the idea that the [[North Pole]] was the original home of Aryans during the pre-glacial period which they had to leave due to the ice deluge around [[8th millennium BC|8000 B.C.]] and had to migrate to the Northern parts of Europe and Asia in search of lands for new settlements. In support to his theory, Tilak presented certain [[Vedic]] hymns, [[Avestic]] passages, Vedic chronology and Vedic calendars with interpretations of the contents in detail.

The book was written at the end of 1898, but was first published in March 1903 in [[Pune]].

==Background==
Man was believed to be post-[[glacial]], and the theory of an Asiatic origin of the Aryan peoples prevailed. The age of the oldest Vedic period, however, was carried back to 4500 BC by scholars including the author himself after scientific astronomical research in correlation with the evidence found in the Vedic hymns.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Tilak cites a book by [[William Fairfield Warren|William F. Warren]], the first President of [[Boston University]], ''Paradise Found or the Cradle of the Human Race at the North Pole'', as having anticipated his ideas to some extent. Warren dedicated his book to [[Max Müller]], with whom Tilak had shared ideas before the book{{clarify|reason=Tilak's book or Warren's?|date=July 2016}} was completed.

Tilak held the view that further study of Vedic hymns and Avestan passages might reveal the long vista of primitive Aryan antiquity.

==Summary of Tilak’s polar theory==
*[[Neolithic]] Aryan race in Europe cannot be regarded as [[indigenous peoples|autochthonous]], nor European Aryans descended from the [[Paleolithic]] man. Hence, question of the original Aryan home is still unsettled.
*In the early geological ages, the [[Alps]] were low, the [[Himalayas]] not yet upheaved, Asia and Africa were represented only by a group of islands and an equable and uniform climate prevailed over the whole surface of the globe. In those days, however, a warm climate prevailed in the Arctic region.
*The close of the [[Pliocene]] and the whole of the [[Pleistocene]] period were marked by violent changes of climate bringing on what is called the Glacial and Inter-Glacial epochs. A succession of cold and warm climates must have characterized these Glacial and Inter-Glacial periods which were also accompanied by extensive movements of depression and elevation of land, the depression taking place after the land was weighed down with the enormous mass of ice.
*Thus a period of glaciations was marked by elevation, extreme cold and the invasion of the ice-caps over regions of the present Temperate zone; while an inter-glacial period was accompanied by depression of land and milder and congenial climate which made even the Arctic regions habitable.
*According to the latest geological evidence, the last Glacial period must have closed and Post-Glacial must have commenced at about 10,000 years ago or 8,000 BC. There were at least two Glacial and one Inter-Glacial period, and the geographical distribution of land and water on the earth during the Inter-Glacial period was quite different from what it is at present. It was the coming on of the Glacial age that destroyed this genial climate and rendered the regions unsuited for the habitation of tropical plants and animals.
*At the North Pole, one sees the heavenly dome above seems to revolve around one like a [[potter's wheel]]. The stars will not rise and set but move round and round in horizontal planes during the long night of six months. The [[Sun]], when it is above the horizon for six months; would also appear to revolve in the same way but with some difference. The Northern celestial hemisphere will alone be visible spinning round and round and the Southern half remain invisible. The Sun going into the Northern hemisphere in his annual course will appear as coming up from the South. Living in the temperate and tropical zones, however, one sees all heavenly objects rise in the East and set in the West, some passing over the head, others traveling obliquely.
*The long dawn of two months is a special and important characteristic of the North Pole. As we descend southward, the splendor and the duration of the dawn will be witnessed on a less and less magnificent scale. But the dawn occurring at the end of the long night of two, three or more months will still be unusually long, often of several days duration.
*All these characteristics of an Arctic home are clearly recorded in several Vedic hymns and Avestic passages and they come to us sometimes as the description of the prevailing conditions or the day-to-day experience or stories told by the earlier generation and sometimes as [[myths]].

==Chronology of the post-glacial period==
[[File:Lokmanya.jpg|thumb|Tilak in his Study]]
*10,000 to 8000 BC – The destruction of the original Arctic home by the last [[Ice Age]] and the commencement of the post-Glacial period.
*8000 to 5000 BC – The age of migration from the original home. The survivors of the Aryan race roamed over the northern parts of Europe and Asia in search of lands suitable for new settlements. Tilak calls it the ''Pre-Orion Period''.
*5000 to 3000 BC. -  The Orion period, when the vernal equinox was in [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]. Many Vedic hymns can be traced to the early part of this period and the [[bards]] of the race seem to have not yet forgotten the real importance of the traditions of the Arctic home inherited by them. It was at this time that first attempts to reform the calendar and the [[sacrificial]] system appear to have been systematically made.
*3000 to 1400 BC – The ''[[Krittika]]'' period, when the [[Vernal equinox]] was in [[Pleiades]]. The traditions about the original Arctic home had grown dim by this time and were often misunderstood, making the Vedic hymns less and less intelligible.
*1400 to 500 BC – The Pre-Buddhistic period, when the [[Sūtra|Sutras]] and the Philosophical systems made their appearance.

'''''The End of History and the Last Man''''' is a 1992 book by [[Francis Fukuyama]], expanding on his 1989 essay "The End of History?", published in the international affairs journal ''[[The National Interest]]''.&lt;ref name='endofhistory'&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0884-9382| issue = 16| pages = 3–18| last = Fukuyama| first = Francis| title = The End of History?| journal = The National Interest| date = 1989| jstor = 24027184}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Fukuyama argues that the advent{{clarify|date=November 2018}} of [[Western world|Western]] [[liberal democracy]] may signal the endpoint of humanity's [[sociocultural evolution]] and the final form of human government.

&lt;blockquote&gt;What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the [[Cold War]], or the passing of a particular period of post-war history, but the [[end of history]] as such: that is, the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western [[liberal democracy]] as the final form of human government.&lt;ref name='endofhistory' /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fukuyama's position contradicts that of [[Karl Marx]], who predicted that [[communism]] would displace [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;"This social formation constitutes, therefore, the closing chapter of the prehistoric stage of human society." [[q:Karl Marx#preface|Preface to 'A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy']] (1859)&lt;/ref&gt; Fukuyama himself identifies on some level with Marx, but more strongly with the German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], by way of [[Alexandre Kojève]]. Kojève argued that the progress of history must lead toward the establishment of a "universal and homogenous" state,&lt;ref&gt;Strauss's term, from the Strauss-Kojève correspondence, published in [[Leo Strauss]], ''On Tyranny'' (University of Chicago Press, 1961)&lt;/ref&gt; most likely incorporating elements of liberal or social democracy; but Kojève's emphasis on the necessarily "post-political" character of such a state (and its citizens) makes such comparisons inadequate, and is irreducible to any mere "triumph" of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre Kojève, ''Introduction to the Reading of Hegel: Lectures on the'' Phenomenology of Spirit, (Basic Books, 1969), "Note to the Second Edition," p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Highlights ==
*History should be viewed as an evolutionary process.
*Events still occur at the end of history.
*Pessimism about humanity's future is warranted because of humanity's inability to control technology.
*The end of history means liberal democracy is the final form of government for all nations. There can be no progression from liberal democracy to an alternative system.

===Misinterpretations===
According to Fukuyama, since the [[French Revolution]], democracy has repeatedly proven to be a fundamentally better system (ethically, politically, economically) than any of the alternatives.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The most basic (and prevalent) error in discussing Fukuyama's work is to confuse "history" with "events".{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} Fukuyama claims not that events will stop occurring in the future, but rather that all that will happen in the future (even if [[totalitarianism]] returns) is that democracy will become more and more prevalent in the ''long'' term, although it may suffer "temporary" setbacks (which may, of course, last for centuries).

Some argue{{who|date=December 2010}} that Fukuyama presents "American-style" democracy as the only "correct" political system and argues that all countries must inevitably follow this particular system of government. However, many Fukuyama scholars claim this is a misreading of his work.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Fukuyama's argument is only that in the future there will be more and more governments that use the framework of [[parliamentary democracy]] and that contain markets of some sort. Indeed, Fukuyama has stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The End of History'' was never linked to a specifically American model of social or political organization. Following [[Alexandre Kojève]], the Russian-French philosopher who inspired my original argument, I believe that the [[European Union]] more accurately reflects what the world will look like at the end of history than the contemporary United States.  The EU's attempt to transcend sovereignty and traditional power politics by establishing a transnational [[rule of law]] is much more in line with a "post-historical" world than the Americans' continuing belief in [[God]], [[national sovereignty]], and their military.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Fukuyama. (2007-04-03).  [http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/francis_fukuyama/2007/04/the_history_at_the_end_of_hist.html The history at the end of history.] [[The Guardian]]. Retrieved 2008-06-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Arguments in favour==
An argument in favour of Fukuyama's thesis is the [[democratic peace theory]], which argues that mature democracies rarely or never go to war with one another. This theory has faced [[democratic peace theory#Criticism|criticism]], with arguments largely resting on conflicting definitions of "war" and "mature democracy". Part of the difficulty in assessing the theory is that democracy as a widespread global phenomenon emerged only very recently in human history, which makes generalizing about it difficult. (See also [[list of wars between democracies]].)

Other major empirical evidence includes the elimination of interstate warfare in South America, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe among countries that moved from military dictatorships to liberal democracies.

According to several studies, the end of the Cold War and the subsequent increase in the number of [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] states were accompanied by a sudden and dramatic decline in total [[war]]fare, interstate wars, [[ethnic]] wars, [[revolutionary]] wars, and the number of [[refugees]] and [[displaced person]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.systemicpeace.org/conflicttrends.html |title=Global Conflict Trends |website=Center for Systemic Peace |year=2017 |accessdate=2017-10-05}} &lt;!-- orig source link archived at web.archive.org/web/20080725183848/http://members.aol.com/CSPmgm/conflict.htm --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsrgroup.org/human-security-reports/2005/overview.aspx|title=Human Security Report 2005|website=[[Human Security Report Project]]|accessdate=2017-10-05}} &lt;!-- orig source link archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20070622155859/http://www.humansecurityreport.info --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Critics of liberal democracy===
Some have argued against the book due to an ideological disagreement with the concept of liberal democracy.

[[Jacques Derrida]] criticized Fukuyama in ''[[Specters of Marx]]'' (1993) as a "come-lately reader" of [[Alexandre Kojève]] "in the tradition of [[Leo Strauss]]", who already described US society in the 1950s as the "realization of communism". According to Derrida, Fukuyama—and the quick celebrity of his book—is but one symptom of the anxiety to ensure the "death of Marx". Fukuyama's celebration of [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[hegemony]] is criticized by Derrida:

{{quote|For it must be cried out, at a time when some have the audacity to neo-evangelize in the name of the ideal of a liberal democracy that has finally realized itself as the ideal of human history: never have violence, inequality, exclusion, [[famine]], and thus economic oppression affected as many human beings in the history of the earth and of humanity. Instead of singing the advent of the ideal of liberal democracy and of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] market in the euphoria of the end of history, instead of celebrating the ‘end of ideologies’ and the end of the great emancipatory discourses, let us never neglect this obvious macroscopic fact, made up of innumerable singular sites of suffering: no degree of progress allows one to ignore that never before, in absolute figures, have so many men, women and children been subjugated, starved or exterminated on the earth.&lt;ref name="Specters of Marx"&gt;Derrida, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Derrida goes on to analyze Fukuyama's book as taking part in the intellectual branch of current Western hegemony and the spreading of its "New Gospel": "This end of History is essentially a [[Christian eschatology]]. It is consonant with the current discourse of the Pope on the European community: destined to become a Christian State or Super-State, this community would still belong therefore to some Holy Alliance." He claims that the book uses a "sleight-of-hand trick" of making use of empirical data whenever it seems to suit its message, while appealing to an ideal whenever the empirical data contradicts it. Derrida points out that Fukuyama himself sees the real United States and European Union as imperfect compared to the "ideals" of liberal democracy and the free market. Even the author understands that such ideals are not demonstrated by empirical evidence or ever could be demonstrated empirically. They belong entirely to the realm of philosophy or religion, owing their birth to the Gospels of Philosophy of [[Hegel]]. And yet Fukuyama still uses a movement toward empirical observations, which he himself grants are imperfect and incomplete, to validate an idea that is purely idealistic and transcendent of any empirical reality or possibility.&lt;ref name="Specters of Marx"/&gt;

Certain versions of Marxism can be conceived as "end of history" philosophies. Therefore, Marxists like [[Perry Anderson]] have been among Fukuyama's fiercest critics. Apart from pointing out that capitalist democracies are still riven with poverty, racial tension, and the like, Marxists also reject Fukuyama's reliance on Hegel. According to them, Hegel's philosophy was fatally flawed until Marx "turned it on its head" to create [[historical materialism]]. Fukuyama argues that even though there is poverty, [[racism]], and [[sexism]] in present-day democracies, there is no sign of a major revolutionary movement developing that would actually overthrow capitalism. While Marxists disagree with Fukuyama's claim that ''capitalist'' democracy represents the end of history, they support the idea that the "end of history" will consist of the victory of democracy: [[communism]], in the Marxist view, must necessarily involve a form of [[direct democracy]].

Former [[President of Venezuela|Venezuelan President]] [[Hugo Chávez]] argued against "the end of history": he argued his case in his September 2006 address to the [[United Nations General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0920-22.htm|title=Text of Hugo Chávez's address to the United Nations General Assembly, September 2006|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005050541/http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0920-22.htm|archivedate=2006-10-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before that, in August 2006, Fukuyama wrote in response to Chávez's argument, his main point being that ''[[Chavismo]]'' was only possible due to the unique [[oil]] reserves of [[Venezuela]], and thus would not spread.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Fukuyama. (2006-08-06). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/04/AR2006080401768.html History's Against Him]. [[The Washington Post]]. Retrieved 2008-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marxist interpretations aside, the economic and social philosophy of Fukuyama can be summarized as Free-Market Libertarian. Although this tends to be an ambiguous word, he uses it in the proper meaning for the time when the book was published. It has been argued that he might even be a Neoconservative on some points but this has been firmly shot down by him and his use of "ideal" systems which is firmly denounced by many Anarcho-Capitalists of the same rote who believe that no government can be good. His moral bent is strikingly similar but he does not identify with the founding fathers while espousing the same form of government to avoid petty debates.

===Radical Islam, tribalism, and the "Clash of Civilizations"===
Various Western commentators have described the thesis of ''The End of History'' as flawed because it does not sufficiently take into account the power of ethnic loyalties and religious fundamentalism as a counter-force to the spread of liberal democracy, with the specific example of [[Islamic fundamentalism]], or radical Islam, as the most powerful of these.

[[Benjamin Barber]] wrote a 1992 article and a 1995 book, ''[[Jihad vs. McWorld]]'', that addressed this theme. Barber described "[[McWorld]]" as a secular, liberal, corporate-friendly transformation of the world and used the word "[[jihad]]" to refer to the competing forces of tribalism and religious fundamentalism, with a special emphasis on Islamic fundamentalism.

[[Samuel P. Huntington]] wrote a 1993 essay, "[[Clash of Civilizations|The Clash of Civilizations]]", in direct response to ''The End of History''; he then expanded the essay into a 1996 book, ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order''. In the essay and book, Huntington argued that the temporary conflict between ideologies is being replaced by the ancient conflict between civilizations. The dominant civilization decides the form of human government, and these will not be constant. He especially singled out Islam, which he described as having "bloody borders".

After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]], ''The End of History'' was cited by some commentators as a symbol of the supposed naiveté and undue optimism of the Western world during the 1990s, in thinking that the end of the [[Cold War]] also represented the end of major global conflict. In the weeks after the attacks, [[Fareed Zakaria]] called the events "the end of the end of history", while [[George Will]] wrote that history had "returned from vacation".&lt;ref name="history is still"&gt;[http://englishmatters.gmu.edu/issue6/911exhibit/emails/fukuyama_wsj.htm History Is Still Going Our Way], Francis Fukuyama, ''The Wall Street Journal'', October 5, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Fukuyama did discuss radical Islam briefly in ''The End of History''. He argued that [[Islam]] is not an [[imperialist]] force like Stalinism and fascism; that is, it has little intellectual or emotional appeal outside the Islamic "heartlands". Fukuyama pointed to the economic and political difficulties that  [[Iran]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] face and argued that such states are fundamentally unstable: either they will become democracies with a Muslim society (like  [[Turkey]]) or they will simply disintegrate. Moreover, when [[Islamic state]]s have actually been created, they were easily dominated by the powerful Western states.

In October 2001, Fukuyama, in a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' opinion piece, responded to the declarations that the September 11 attacks had disproved his views by stating that "time and resources are on the side of modernity, and I see no lack of a will to prevail in the United States today." He also noted that his original thesis "does not imply a world free from conflict, nor the disappearance of culture as a distinguishing characteristic of societies."&lt;ref name="history is still" /&gt;

In a 2008 ''[[Washington Post]]'' opinion piece, Fukuyama wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Democracy's only real competitor in the realm of ideas today is radical [[Islamism]]. Indeed, one of the world's most dangerous nation-states today is Iran, run by extremist Shiite mullahs. But as [[Peter Bergen]] pointed out in these pages last week, Sunni radicalism has been remarkably ineffective in actually taking control of a nation-state, due to its propensity to devour its own potential supporters. Some disenfranchised Muslims thrill to the rantings of Osama bin Laden or Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], but the appeal of this kind of medieval Islamism is strictly limited.&lt;ref name="they can only"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/22/AR2008082202395.html They Can Only Go So Far], Francis Fukuyama, ''The Washington Post'', August 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The resurgence of Russia and China===
Another challenge to the "end of history" thesis is the growth in the economic and political power of two countries, [[Russia]] and [[China]]; China has a [[one-party state]] government, while Russia, though formally a democracy, has been described by some as ''[[de facto]]'' authoritarian.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/7386448/Dmitry-Medvedevs-Russia-still-feels-the-cold-hand-of-Vladimir-Putin.html Dmitry Medvedev's Russia still feels the cold hand of Vladimir Putin], Andrew Osborn, ''The Daily Telegraph'', March 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Azar Gat]], Professor of National Security at [[Tel Aviv University]], argued this point in his 2007  ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' article, "The Return of Authoritarian Great Powers", stating that the success of these two countries could "end the end of history".&lt;ref&gt;A. GAT, "The End of the End of History" in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', July/August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Gat also discussed radical Islam, but stated that the movements associated with it "represent no viable alternative to modernity and pose no significant military threat to the developed world". He considered the challenge of China and Russia to be the  major threat, since they could pose a viable rival model which could inspire other states.

This view was echoed by [[Robert Kagan]] in his 2008 book, ''The Return of History and the End of Dreams'', whose title was a deliberate rejoinder to ''The End of History''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111002021637/https://literaryreview.co.uk/burleigh_05_08.html Return of the Dog Pack] (review of ''The Return of History and the End of Dreams''), [[Michael Burleigh]], ''Literary Review'', May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2008 ''Washington Post'' opinion piece, Fukuyama also addressed this point. He wrote, "Despite recent authoritarian advances, liberal democracy remains the strongest, most broadly appealing idea out there. Most autocrats, including [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] and [[Hugo Chávez|Chávez]], still feel that they have to conform to the outward rituals of democracy even as they gut its substance. Even China's [[Hu Jintao]] felt compelled to talk about democracy in the run-up to [[2008 Summer Olympic|Beijing's Olympic Games]]."&lt;ref name="they can only" /&gt;

===Failure of civil society and political decay===
In 2014, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the publication of the original essay, "The End of History?", Fukuyama wrote a column in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' again updating his hypothesis. He wrote that, while liberal democracy still had no real competition from more authoritarian systems of government "in the realm of ideas", nevertheless he was less idealistic than he had been "during the heady days of 1989." Fukuyama noted the [[Orange Revolution]] in [[Ukraine]] and the [[Arab Spring]], both of which seemed to have failed in their pro-democracy goals, as well as the [[democratic backsliding|"backsliding" of democracy]] in countries including [[Thailand]], [[Turkey]] and [[Nicaragua]]. He stated that the biggest problem for the democratically elected governments in some countries was not ideological but "their failure to provide the substance of what people want from government: personal security, shared economic growth and the basic public services... that are needed to achieve individual opportunity." Though he believed that economic growth, improved government and civic institutions all reinforced one another, he wrote that it was not inevitable that "all countries will... get on that escalator."&lt;ref name="25 years"&gt;{{cite web |title=At the 'End of History' Still Stands Democracy |url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/at-the-end-of-history-still-stands-democracy-1402080661 |work=The Wall Street Journal |first=Francis |last=Fukuyama |date=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Twenty-five years later, the most serious threat to the end-of-history hypothesis isn't that there is a higher, better model out there that will someday supersede liberal democracy; neither Islamist theocracy nor Chinese capitalism cuts it. Once societies get on the up escalator of industrialization, their social structure begins to change in ways that increase demands for political participation. If political elites accommodate these demands, we arrive at some version of democracy.}}

Fukuyama also warned of "political decay," which he wrote could also affect established democracies like the United States, in which corruption and [[crony capitalism]] erode liberty and economic opportunity. Nevertheless, he expressed his continued belief that "the power of the democratic ideal remains immense."&lt;ref name="25 years" /&gt;

Following Britain's [[Brexit|decision to leave]] the [[European Union]] and the [[United States presidential election, 2016|election]] of [[Donald Trump]] as [[President of the United States]] in 2016, Fukuyama feared for the future of liberal democracy in the face of resurgent populism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/09/the-man-who-declared-the-end-of-history-fears-for-democracys-future/|title=The man who declared the ‘end of history’ fears for democracy’s future|author=Ishaan Tharoor|date=2017-02-09|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nationalpost.com/news/world/the-man-who-declared-the-end-of-history-now-fearful-of-the-very-fate-of-liberal-democracy|title=The man who declared the 'end of history' now fearful of the very fate of liberal democracy|author=Francis Fukuyama|date=2017-02-09|publisher=National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=prospect&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/america-the-failed-state-donald-trump|title=America: the failed state|author=Francis Fukuyama|date=Jan 2017|publisher=Prospect Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rise of a "post-fact world",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/the-emergence-of-a-post-fact-world-by-francis-fukuyama-2017-01?barrier=accessreg|title=The Emergence of a Post-Fact World|author=Francis Fukuyama|date=2017-01-12|publisher=Project Syndicate}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that "twenty five years ago, I didn't have a sense or a theory about how democracies can go backward. And I think they clearly can." He also warned that America's political rot was infecting the world order to the point where it "could be as big as the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet collapse]]".&lt;ref name=prospect /&gt;

===Posthuman future===
{{See also|Transhumanism}}
Fukuyama has also stated that his thesis was incomplete, but for a different reason: "there can be no end of history without an end of modern natural science and technology" (quoted from ''[[Our Posthuman Future]]''). Fukuyama predicts that humanity's control of its own [[evolution]] will have a great and possibly terrible effect on liberal democracy.

'''Transhistoricity''' is the quality of holding throughout human history, not merely within the frame of reference of a particular form of [[society]] at a particular stage of historical development. An entity or concept that has transhistoricity is said to be '''transhistorical'''.

Certain theories of history (e.g. that of [[Historicism#Hegelian|Hegel]]), treat human history as divided into distinct [[historical period|epoch]]s with their own internal [[logic]]s—[[historical materialism]] is the most famous case of such a theory. States of affairs which hold within one epoch may be completely absent, or carry opposite implications in another, according to these theories.

== In the abstract ==
Transhistoricity may be seen as the necessary [[antithesis]] to the idea that meanings are bounded by their historical context. It is the temporal equivalent of the spatial concept of [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]].

== In sociopolitical theory ==
Questions of what might and might not be transhistorical phenomena are typically the concern of historians and sociologists identifying with the [[Historicism|historicist]] traditions of [[Hegel]]ian or [[Karl Marx|Marxian]] thought, but matter additionally in the debates around [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s notion of [[paradigm shift]] and similar discussions. 

[[Fredric Jameson]], a [[Marxist]] or perhaps [[post-modern]] theorist, is a case in point. He famously asserted that theory must "Always historicize!", going on to wryly observe that this order was itself a "transhistorical imperative".&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric (1981). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9xE6vLE71yUC&amp;dq=%22the+political+unconscious%22+books&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=print&amp;ct=book-ref-page-link&amp;cad=one-book-with-thumbnail&amp;hl=en ''The Political Unconscious'']. Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others look for transhistorical continuities to inform what's basic to the human condition. For example, D. K. Simonton, finds some regularities in the types of ideas that gain ascendancy following certain types of historical events, in a data series spanning 2,500 years.&lt;ref&gt;Simonton, D. K. (1976). ''The Sociopolitical Context of Philosophical Beliefs: A Transhistorical Causal Analysis''. ''Social Forces''. vol. 54. pp. 513–523.&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent years, research in the vicinity of [[Evolutionary psychology]] has proceeded on the basis that some observed transcultural regularities in human behaviour are also transhistoric, accounted for by their being fixed in the genetic legacy common to all ''Homo sapiens''.

== In aesthetics ==
Part of the debate over the distinction between [[high art]] and [[folk art]] (or lesser disciplines) hinges on the question of whether art can (and if so, if it should) aspire to transcend the particular frame of reference within which it was produced. This frame may be taken to be historically delimited.&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, Paul (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=XpMsL8f56RMC&amp;dq=transhistorical+image+philosophizing+art ''The Transhistoric Image: Philosophizing Art and Its History''].

{{History of England}}
{{Periods in English History}}
{{History of the British Isles}}

The '''Tudor period''' is the period between 1485 and 1603 in [[History of England|England and Wales]] and includes the [[Elizabethan period]] during the [[reign]] of [[Elizabeth I]] until 1603. The Tudor period coincides with the dynasty of the [[House of Tudor]] in England whose first monarch was [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] (1457{{ndash}}1509). In terms of the entire span, the historian [[John Guy (historian)|John Guy]] (1988) argues that "England was economically healthier, more expansive, and more optimistic under the Tudors" than at any time in a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;John Guy (1988) ''Tudor England'', Oxford University Press, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population and economy==
Following the [[Black Death]] and the agricultural depression of the late 15th century, the population began to increase. It was less than 2 million in 1450, and about 4 million in 1600. The growing population stimulated economic growth, accelerated the commercialisation of agriculture, increased the production and export of wool, encouraged trade, and promoted the growth of London. &lt;ref&gt;David M. Palliser, ''The Age of Elizabeth: England under the later Tudors, 1547–1603'' p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;

The high wages and abundance of available land seen in the late 15th century and early 16th century were replaced with low wages and a land shortage. Various inflationary pressures, perhaps due to an influx of New World gold and a rising population, set the stage for social upheaval with the gap between the rich and poor widening. This was a period of significant change for the majority of the rural population, with [[manorial]] lords beginning the process of [[enclosure]] of village lands that previously had been open to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Dawson, ''The Tudor century'' (1993) p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

==English Reformation==
{{Main article|English Reformation}}
The Reformation transformed English religion during the Tudor period. The four sovereigns, Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary I, and Elizabeth I had entirely different approaches, with Henry replacing the pope as the head of the Church of England but maintaining Catholic doctrines, Edward imposing a very strict Protestantism, Mary attempting to reinstate Catholicism, and Elizabeth arriving at a compromising position that defined the not-quite-Protestant Church of England. It began with the insistent demands of Henry VIII for an annulment of his marriage that [[Pope Clement VII]] refused to grant.&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Marshall, ''Heretics and Believers: A History of the English Reformation'' (Yale UP, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians agreed that the great theme of Tudor history was the Reformation, the transformation of England from Catholicism to Protestantism. The main events, constitutional changes, and players at the national level have long been known, and the major controversies about them largely resolved. Historians until the late 20th century assumed that they knew what the causes were: on the one hand, a widespread dissatisfaction or even disgust with the evils, corruptions, failures, and contradictions of the established religion, setting up an undertone of [[anti-clericalism]] that indicated a rightness for reform. A second, less powerful influence was the intellectual impact of certain English reformers, such as the long-term impact of [[John Wycliffe]] (1328–1384) and his “[[Lollardy]]” reform movement, together with a stream of Reformation treatises and pamphlets from [[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]], and other reformers on the continent. The interpretation by [[Geoffrey Elton]] in 1960 is representative of the orthodox interpretation. He argues that:
:The existing situation proved untenable because the laity feared, resented, and despised much about the Church, its officers, its courts and its wealth. . . . A poverty-stricken and ignorant lower clergy, wealthy bishops and abbots, a wide ramification of jurisdiction, a mixture of high claims and low deeds did not make for respect or love among the laity.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Elton, ''The Tudor Constitution: Documents and Commentary'' (1960) pp 318–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Social historians after 1960 began in-depth investigations of English religion at the local level, and discovered the orthodox interpretation was quite mistaken. The Lollardy movement had largely expired, and the pamphleteering of continental reformers hardly reached beyond a few scholars at the [[University of Cambridge]]—King Henry VIII had vigorously and publicly denounced Luther's heresies. More important, the Catholic Church was in a strong condition in 1500. England was devoutly Catholic, it was loyal to the pope, local parishes attracted strong local financial support, religious services were quite popular both at Sunday Mass and at family devotions. Complaints about the monasteries and the bishops were uncommon. The kings got along well with the popes and by the time Luther appeared on the scene, England was among the strongest supporters of orthodox Catholicism, and seemed a most unlikely place for a religious revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald H. Fritze, ''Historical Dictionary of Tudor England, 1485–1603'' (1991) 419-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Cannon, ''The Oxford Companion to British history'' (1997) pp 794–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tudor government==
===Henry VII:  1485–1509 ===
[[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], founder of the [[House of Tudor]], became [[King of England]] by defeating King [[Richard III]] at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]], the culmination of the [[Wars of the Roses]].  Henry engaged in a number of administrative, economic and diplomatic initiatives. He paid very close attention to detail and, instead of spending lavishly, concentrated on raising new revenues. His new taxes were unpopular, and when Henry VIII succeeded him, he executed Henry VII's two most hated tax collectors.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Anglo,  "Ill of the dead: The posthumous reputation of Henry VII", ''Renaissance Studies'' 1 (1987): 27–47. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24410008 online]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Gunn, ''Henry VII's New Men and the Making of Tudor England'' (2016)&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Henry VIII: 1509–1547===
{{Further|Henry VIII of England|Anglo-Scottish Wars}}
Henry VIII, flamboyant, energetic, militaristic and headstrong, remains one of the most visible kings of England, primarily because of his six marriages, all designed to produce a male heir, and his heavy retribution in executing many top officials and aristocrats. In foreign-policy, he focused on fighting France—with minimal success—and had to deal with Scotland, Spain, and the Holy Roman Empire, often with military mobilisation or actual highly expensive warfare that led to high taxes. The chief military success came over Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;E. W. Ives, "Henry VIII (1491–1547)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' (2009) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12955, accessed 8 Aug 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The main policy development was Henry's taking full control of the Church of England. This followed from his break from Rome, which was caused by the refusal of the Pope to annul his original marriage. Henry thereby introduced a very mild variation of the Protestant Reformation. There were two main aspects. First Henry rejected the Pope as the head of the Church in England, insisting that national sovereignty required the Absolute supremacy of the king. Henry worked closely with Parliament in passing a series of laws that implemented the break. Englishmen could no longer appeal to Rome. All the decisions were to be made in England, ultimately by the King himself, and in practice by top aides such as Cardinal Wolsey and Thomas Cromwell. Parliament proved highly supportive, with little dissent. The decisive moves came with the [[Acts of Supremacy|Act of Supremacy in 1534]] that made the king the protector and only supreme head of the church and clergy of England. After Henry imposed a heavy fine on the bishops, they nearly all complied. The laws of treason were greatly strengthened so that verbal dissent alone was treasonous. There were some short-lived popular rebellions that were quickly suppressed. The league level in terms of the aristocracy and the Church was supportive. The highly visible main refusals came from Bishop Fisher and Chancellor Thomas More; they were both executed. Among the senior aristocrats, trouble came from the Pole family, which supported [[Reginald Pole]] who was in exile in Europe. Henry destroyed the rest of the family, executing its leaders, and seizing all its property. The second stage involved the seizure of the monasteries. The monasteries operating religious and charitable institutions were closed, the monks and nuns were pensioned off, and the valuable lands were sold to friends of the King, thereby producing a large, wealthy, gentry class that supported Henry. In terms of theology and ritual there was little change, as Henry wanted to keep most elements of Catholicism and detested the "heresies" of Martin Luther and the other reformers.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rex, ''Henry VIII and the English reformation'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Father of the Royal Navy====
Biographer [[Jack Scarisbrick|J.J. Scarisbrick]] says that Henry deserved his traditional title of 'Father of the English navy.'&lt;ref&gt;J.J. Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'' (1968) pp 500–1.&lt;/ref&gt; It became his personal weapon, his plaything, his passion. He inherited seven small warships from his father, and added two dozen more by 1514. In addition to those built in England, he bought up Italian and Hanseatic warships. By March 1513, he proudly watched his fleet sail down the Thames under command of Sir Edmund Howard. It was the most powerful naval force to date in English history: 24 ships led by the 1600 ton "Henry Imperial"; the fleet carried 5000 combat marines and 3000 sailors. It forced the outnumbered French fleet back to its ports, took control of the English Channel, and blockaded Brest. Henry was the first king to organise the navy as a permanent force, with a permanent administrative and logistical structure, funded by tax revenue. His personal attention was concentrated on land, where he founded the royal dockyards, planted trees for shipbuilding, enacted laws for in land navigation, guarded the coastline with fortifications, set up a school for navigation and designated the roles of officers and sailors. He closely supervised the construction of all his warships and their guns, knowing their designs, speed, tonnage, armaments and battle tactics. He encouraged his naval architects, who perfected the Italian technique of mounting guns in the waist of the ship, thus lowering the centre of gravity and making it a better platform. He supervised the smallest details and enjoyed nothing more than presiding over the launching of a new ship.&lt;ref&gt;A.F. Pollard, ''Henry VIII'' (1902) pp 50, 100–2.&lt;/ref&gt; He drained his treasury on military and naval affairs, diverting the revenues from new taxes and the sales of monastery lands.&lt;ref&gt;N.A.M. Rodger, ''The Safeguard of the Sea: A Naval History of Britain 660 – 1649'' (1997) pp 184, 221 236–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Loades, ''The Tudor Navy: An administrative, political and military history'' (1992) is the standard history.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elaine W. Fowler, ''English sea power in the early Tudor period, 1485–1558'' (1965) is an older study.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elton argues that Henry indeed build up the organisation and infrastructure of the Navy, but it was not a useful weapon for his style of warfare. It lacked a useful strategy. It did serve for defence against invasion, and for enhancing England's international prestige.&lt;ref&gt;G.R. Elton, ''Reform and Reformation: England, 1509–1558'' (1977) pp 309–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cardinal Wolsey====
Professor Sara Nair James says that in 1515–1529 Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]], "would be the most powerful man in England except, possibly, for the king."&lt;ref&gt;Sara Nair James, "Cardinal Wolsey: The English Cardinal Italianate" in {{cite book|author=Christopher Cobb, ed. |title=Renaissance Papers 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K04ldsy8dHEC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2009|publisher=Camden House|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[John Guy (historian)|John Guy]] explains Wolsey's methods:
:Only in the broadest respects was he [the king] taking independent decisions....It was Wolsey who almost invariably calculated the available options and ranked them for royal consideration; who established the parameters of each successive debate; who controlled the flow of official information; who selected the king's secretaries, middle-ranked officials, and JPs; and who promulgated decisions himself had largely shaped, if not strictly taken.&lt;ref&gt;John Guy, ''Tudor England'' (1988) p 87.&lt;/ref&gt;
Operating with the firm support of the king, and with special powers over the church given by the Pope, Wolsey dominated civic affairs, administration, the law, the church, and foreign-policy. He was amazingly energetic and far-reaching. In terms of achievements, he built a great fortune for himself, and was a major benefactor of arts, humanities and education. He projected numerous reforms, but in the end English government had not changed much. For all the promise, there was very little achievement of note. From the king's perspective, his greatest failure was an inability to get a divorce when Henry VIII needed a new wife to give him a son who would be the undisputed heir to the throne. Historians agree that Wolsey was a disappointment. In the end, he conspired with Henry's enemies, and died of natural causes before he could be beheaded.&lt;ref&gt;S.T. Bindoff, ''Tudor England'' (1950), p 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Mackie, ''The Earlier Tudors 1485 – 1558'' (1952), pp 286–334.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thomas Cromwell====
Historian Geoffrey Elton argued that [[Thomas Cromwell]], who was Henry VIII's [[List of English chief ministers|chief minister]] from 1532 to 1540, not only removed control of the Church of England from the hands of the Pope, but transformed England with an unprecedented modern, bureaucratic government.&lt;ref&gt;G.R. Elton, ''The Tudor Revolution in Government'' (1953).&lt;/ref&gt; Cromwell (1485–1540)&lt;ref&gt;He was a distant relative of [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1599–1658) who ruled a century later.&lt;/ref&gt; replaced medieval government-as-household-management. Cromwell introduced reforms into the administration that delineated the King's household from the state and created a modern administration. He injected Tudor power into the darker corners of the realm and radically altered the role of the [[Parliament of England]]. This transition happened in the 1530s, Elton argued, and must be regarded as part of a planned revolution. Elton's point was that before Cromwell the realm could be viewed as the King's private estate writ large, where most administration was done by the King's household servants rather than separate state offices. By masterminding these reforms, Cromwell laid the foundations of England's future stability and success. Cromwell's luck ran out when he picked [[Anne of Cleves|the wrong bride]] for the King; he was beheaded for treason, More recently historians have emphasised that the king and others played powerful roles as well .&lt;ref&gt;Christoper Coleman and David Starkey, eds., ''Revolution Reassessed: Revision in the History of Tudor Government and Administration'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, ''The Earlier Tudors 1485 – 1558'' (1952), pp 413–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dissolution of the Monasteries: 1536–1540====
{{main|Dissolution of the Monasteries}}
The king had an annual income of about £100,000, but he needed much more in order to suppress rebellions and finance his foreign adventures. In 1533, for example, military expenditures on the northern border cost £25,000, while the 1534 rebellion in Ireland cost £38,000. Suppressing the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]] cost £50,000, and the king's new palaces were expensive. Meanwhile, customs revenue was slipping. The Church had an annual revenue of about £300,000; a new tax of 10% was imposed which brought in about £30,000. To get even larger sums it was proposed to seize the lands owned by monasteries, some of which the monks farmed and most of which was leased to local gentry. Taking ownership meant the rents went to the king. Selling the land to the gentry at a bargain price brought in £1 million in one-time revenue and gave the gentry a stake in the administration.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, ''The Earlier Tudors'', pp 370–79.&lt;/ref&gt; The clerical payments from [[Annates|First Fruits and Tenths]], which previously went to the pope, now went to the king.  Altogether, between 1536 and Henry's death, his government collected £1.3 million; this huge influx of money caused Cromwell to change the Crown's financial system to manage the money. He created a new department of state and a new official to collect the proceeds of the dissolution and the First Fruits and Tenths. The [[Court of Augmentations]] and number of departments meant a growing number of officials, which made the management of revenue a major activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John A. Wagner and Susan Walters Schmid|title=Encyclopedia of Tudor England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R_c_md3gMpwC&amp;pg=PA947|year= 2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=947}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cromwell's new system was highly efficient with far less corruption or secret payoffs or bribery than before. Its drawback was the multiplication of departments whose sole unifying agent was Cromwell; his fall caused confusion and uncertainty; the solution was even greater reliance on bureaucratic institutions and the new Privy Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=D. E. Hoak|title=The King's Council in the Reign of Edward VI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sng6AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA89|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge UP|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Role of Winchester====
In dramatic contrast to his father, Henry VIII spent heavily, in terms of military operations in Britain and in France, and in building a great network of palaces. How to pay for it remained a serious issue. The growing number of departments meant many new salaried bureaucrats. There were further financial and administrative difficulties in 1540–58, aggravated by war, debasement, corruption and inefficiency, which were mainly caused by Somerset. After Cromwell's fall, [[William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester]], the [[Lord High Treasurer|Lord Treasurer]], produced further reforms to simplify the arrangements, reforms which united most of the crown's finance under the exchequer. The courts of general surveyors and augmentations were fused into a new Court of Augmentations, and this was later absorbed into the exchequer along with the First Fruits and Tenths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John A. Wagner and Susan Walters Schmid |title=Encyclopedia of Tudor England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R_c_md3gMpwC&amp;pg=PA847|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impact of war====
At the end of his reign, Henry VII's peace time income was about £113,000, Of which customs on imports amounted to about £40,000. There was little debt, and he left his son a large treasury. Henry VIII spent heavily on luxuries, such as tapestries and palaces, but his peacetime budget was generally satisfactory. The heavy strain came from warfare, including building defences, building a Navy, Suppressing insurrections, warring with Scotland, and engaging in very expensive continental warfare. Henry's Continental wars won him little glory or diplomatic influence, and no territory. Nevertheless, warfare 1511 to 1514 with three large expeditions and two smaller ones cost £912,000. The Boulogne campaign of 1544 cost £1,342,000 and the wars against Scotland £954,000; the naval wars cost £149,000 and large sums were spent to build and maintain inland and coastal fortifications. The total cost of war and defence between 1539–1547 was well over £2,000,000, although the accounting procedures were too primitive to give an accurate total. Adding it all up, approximately 35% came from taxes, 32% from selling land and monastery holdings, and 30% from debasing the coinage. The cost of war in the short reign of Edward VI was another £1,387,000.&lt;ref&gt;Penry Williams, ''The Tudor Regime'' (1979) pp 55–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1540, the Privy Coffers were responsible for 'secret affairs', in particular for the financing of war. The [[Royal Mint]] was used to generate revenue by debasing the coinage; the government's profit in 1547–51 was £1.2 million. However, under the direction of regent Northumberland, Edward's wars were brought to an end. The mint no longer generated extra revenue after debasement was stopped in 1551.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Tittler|author2=Norman Jones|title=A Companion to Tudor Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F9_3ktSGOEwC&amp;pg=PA187|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edward VI: 1547–1553===
{{Further|Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland}}
Although Henry was only in his mid-50s, his health deteriorated rapidly in 1546. At the time the conservative faction, led by Bishop [[Stephen Gardiner]] and [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]] that was opposed to religious reformation seemed to be in power, and was poised to take control of the regency of the nine-year-old boy who was heir to the throne. However, when the king died, the pro-reformation factions suddenly seized control of the new king, and of the Regency Council, under the leadership of [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]]. Bishop Gardiner was discredited, and the Duke of Norfolk was imprisoned for all of the new king's reign.&lt;ref&gt;W.K. Jordan, ''Edward VI: The Young King. The Protectorship of the Duke of Somerset'' (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

The short reign of Edward VI marked the triumph of Protestantism in England. Somerset, the elder brother of the late Queen [[Jane Seymour]] (married to Henry VIII) and uncle to King Edward VI had a successful military career. When the boy king was crowned, Somerset became [[Lord Protector]] of the realm and in effect ruled England from 1547 to 1549. Seymour led expensive, inconclusive wars with Scotland. His religious policies angered Catholics. Purgatory was rejected so there was no more need for prayers to saints, relics, and statues, nor for masses for the dead. Some 2400 permanent endowments called [[Chantry|chantries]] had been established that supported thousands of priests who celebrated masses for the dead, or operated schools or hospitals in order to earn grace for the soul in purgatory. The endowments were seized by Cromwell in 1547.&lt;ref&gt;G.R. Elton, ''The Tudor Constitution'' (1960) pp 372, 382–85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dickens, ''The English Reformation,'' pp 197–229.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have contrasted the efficiency of Somerset's takeover of power in 1547 with the subsequent ineptitude of his rule. By autumn 1549, his costly wars had lost momentum, the crown faced financial ruin, and riots and rebellions had broken out around the country. He was overthrown by his former ally [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland]].&lt;ref&gt;Diarmaid MacCulloch, ''The Boy King: Edward VI and the Protestant Reformation'' (2002) p 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recent decades, Somerset's reputation with historians was high, in view of his many proclamations that appeared to back the common people against a rapacious landowning class. In the early 20th century this line was taken by the influential [[A. F. Pollard]], to be echoed by Edward VI's leading biographer [[Wilbur Kitchener Jordan|W. K. Jordan]]. A more critical approach was initiated by M. L. Bush and Dale Hoak in the mid-1970s. Since then, Somerset has often been portrayed as an arrogant ruler, devoid of the political and administrative skills necessary for governing the Tudor state.&lt;ref&gt;G.R. Elton, ''Reform and Reformation'' (1977) pp. 333–50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Loades, "The reign of Edward VI: An historiographical survey" '' Historian'' 67#1 (2000): 22+ [https://search.proquest.com/openview/6e66c4ea075218e9e4650f5ae82126ac/1 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dudley by contrast moved quickly after taking over an almost bankrupt administration in 1549.&lt;ref&gt;David Loades, "Dudley, John, duke of Northumberland (1504–1553)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (2008) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8156, accessed 8 Aug 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; Working with his top aide [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]], Dudley ended the costly wars with France and Scotland and tackled finances in ways that led to some economic recovery. To prevent further uprisings he introduced countrywide policing, appointed [[Lord Lieutenant|Lords Lieutenants]] who were in close contact with London, and set up what amounted to a standing national army. Working closely with [[Thomas Cranmer|Thomas Cramner]], the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dudley pursued an aggressively Protestant religious policy. They promoted radical reformers to high Church positions, with the Catholic bishops under attack. The use of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' became law in 1549; prayers were to be in English not Latin. The Mass was no longer to be celebrated, and preaching became the centerpiece of church services.

[[Purgatory]], Protestantism declared, was a Catholic superstition that falsified the Scriptures. Prayers for the dead were useless because no one was actually in Purgatory. It followed that prayers to saints, veneration of relics, and adoration of statues were all useless superstitions that had to end. For centuries devout Englishman had created endowments called [[chantry|chantries]] designed as good works that generated grace to help them get out of purgatory after they died. Many chantries were altars or chapels inside churches, or endowments that supported thousands of priests who said Masses for the dead. In addition there were many schools and hospitals established as good works. In 1547 a new law closed down 2,374 chantries and seized their assets.&lt;ref&gt;G.R. Elton, ''The Tudor Constitution'' (1960) pp 372, 382–85.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the Act required the money to go to "charitable" ends and the "public good," most of it appears to have gone to friends of the Court.&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Dickens, ''The English Reformation'' (1964) pp 205–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Arthur Geoffrey Dickens|A.G. Dickens]] has concluded:
:To Catholic opinion, the problem set by these legal confiscations ... [was] the disappearance of a large clerical society from their midst, the silencing of masses, the rupture of both visible and spiritual ties, which over so many centuries have linked rude provincial man with a great world of the Faith....The Edwardian dissolution exerted its profounder effects in the field of religion. In large part it proved destructive, for while it helped to debar a revival of Catholic devotion it clearly contain elements which injured the reputation of Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Dickens, The English Reformation'' (1964) p 217&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Protestant orthodoxy for the Church of England was expressed in the [[Thirty-nine Articles#Forty-Two Articles (1553)|Forty-Two Articles of Faith]] in 1553. But when the king suddenly died, Dudley's last-minute efforts to make his daughter-in-law [[Lady Jane Grey]] the new sovereign failed. Queen Mary took over and had him beheaded.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, ''The Earlier Tudors,'' pp 508–22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dickens, ''The English Reformation,'' 230-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mary I: 1553–1558===
{{Main|Mary I of England}}
Mary was the daughter of Henry VIII by [[Catherine of Aragon]]; she closely identified with her Catholic, Spanish heritage. She was next in line for the throne. However, in 1553 as Edward VI lay dying, he and the Duke of Northumberland plotted to make his niece [[Lady Jane Grey]] as the new Queen. Northumberland wanted to keep control of the government, and promote Protestantism. Edward signed a devise to alter the succession, but that was not legal, for only Parliament could amend its own acts. Edward's Privy Council kept his death secret for three days to install Lady Jane, but Northumberland had neglected to take control of Princess Mary. She fled and organised a band of supporters, who proclaimed her Queen across the country. The Privy Council abandoned Northumberland, and proclaimed Mary to be the sovereign after nine days of the pretended Jane Grey. Queen Mary imprisoned Lady Jane and executed Northumberland.&lt;ref&gt;Paulina Kewes, "The 1553 succession crisis reconsidered." ''Historical Research'' (2017). doi:10.1111/1468-2281.12178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley T. Bindoff, "A Kingdom at Stake, 1553." ''History Today'' 3.9 (1953): 642–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary is remembered for her vigorous efforts to restore Roman Catholicism after Edward's short-lived crusade to minimise Catholicism in England. Protestant historians have long denigrated her reign, emphasising that in just five years she burned several hundred Protestants at the stake in the [[Marian persecutions]]. However, a historiographical revisionism since the 1980s has to some degree improved her reputation among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas S. Freeman, "'Restoration and Reaction: Reinterpreting the Marian Church'." ''Journal of Ecclesiastical History'' (2017). [http://repository.essex.ac.uk/20116/1/JEH%20review%20article%20%28final%20version%29.docx online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Loades, "The Reign of Mary Tudor: Historiography and Research." ''Albion'' 21.4 (1989): 547–558. [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/albion/article/the-reign-of-mary-tudor-historiography-and-research/08D58887054B50ADFFD93F606E7DF02B online]&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Haigh's bold reappraisal of the religious history of Mary's reign painted the revival of religious festivities and a general satisfaction, if not enthusiasm, at the return of the old Catholic practices.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Haigh, ''English Reformations: religion, politics and society under the Tudors'' (1992), 203–34.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her re-establishment of Roman Catholicism was reversed by her younger half-sister and successor [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].

Protestant writers at the time took a highly negative view, blasting her as "Bloody Mary". [[John Knox]] attacked her in his ''[[The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women|First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women]]'' (1558), and she was prominently vilified in ''[[Actes and Monuments]]'' (1563), by [[John Foxe]]. Foxe's book taught Protestants for centuries that Mary was a bloodthirsty tyrant. In the mid-20th century, [[H. F. M. Prescott]] attempted to redress the tradition that Mary was intolerant and authoritarian by writing more objectively, and scholarship since then has tended to view the older, simpler, partisan assessments of Mary with greater scepticism.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Weikel, "Mary I (1516–1558)" in ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (2004) doi:10.1093/ref:odnb/18245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haigh concluded that the "last years of Mary's reign were not a gruesome preparation for Protestant victory, but a continuing consolidation of Catholic strength."&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, ''English Reformations: religion, politics and society under the Tudors'' (1992), 234.&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic historians, such as [[John Lingard]], argued Mary's policies failed not because they were wrong but because she had too short a reign to establish them. In other countries, the Catholic Counter-Reformation was spearheaded by Jesuit missionaries; Mary's chief religious advisor, Cardinal Pole, refused to allow the Jesuits in England.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F Mayer "A Test of Wills: Cardinal Pole, Ignatius Loyola, and the Jesuits in England," in {{cite book|author=Thomas M. McCoog, ed., |title=The Reckoned Expense: Edmund Campion and the Early English Jesuits |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f01RY4H7MfoC&amp;pg=PA21|year=1996|pages=21–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain was widely seen as the enemy, and her marriage to King [[Phillip II of Spain]] was deeply unpopular, even though he had practically no role in English government and they had no children.  The military loss of Calais to France was a bitter humiliation to English pride. Failed harvests increased public discontent.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Loades, '' Mary Tudor: A Life'' (1989) pp. 340–343.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Mary's rule was ultimately ineffectual and unpopular, her innovations regarding fiscal reform, naval expansion, and colonial exploration were later lauded as Elizabethan accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Tittler, ''The Reign of Mary I'' (2nd ed. 1991), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elizabeth I: 1558–1603===
{{Main|Elizabethan era}}
Historians often depict Elizabeth's reign as the [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] in English history in terms of political, social and cultural development, and in comparison with [[Continental Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Roy Strong, ''The Cult of Elizabeth: Elizabethan Portraiture and Pageantry '' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hilliam, ''Elizabeth I: Queen of England's Golden Age'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Calling her "Gloriana" and using the symbol of [[Britannia]] starting in 1572, marked the Elizabethan age as a renaissance that inspired national pride through classical ideals, international expansion, and naval triumph over the hated and feared Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;John Morrill, ed. ''The Oxford illustrated history of Tudor &amp; Stuart Britain'' (1996) [https://archive.org/details/oxfordillustrate00john online] pp 44, 325.&lt;/ref&gt;
Elizabeth's reign marks the decisive turning point in English religious history, as a predominantly Catholic nation at the beginning of her reign was predominantly Protestant by the end. Although Elizabeth executed 250 Catholic priests, she also executed some extreme Puritans, and on the whole she sought a moderately conservative position that mixed Royal control of the church (with no people role), combined with predominantly Catholic ritual, and a predominantly Calvinists theology.&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Black, ''The Reign of Elizabeth: 1558–1603'' (1959) pp 1–33, 166–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland and Mary, Queen of Scots====
{{Further|Mary, Queen of Scots|Anglo-Scottish Wars}}
[[Mary, Queen of Scots]] (lived 1542–87) was a devout Catholic and next in line for the throne of England after Elizabeth. Her status became a major domestic and international issue for England.&lt;ref&gt;John Guy, ''Queen of Scots: The True Life of Mary Stuart'' (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of King James IV at the [[Battle of Flodden]] in 1513. The upshot was years of struggle for control of the throne, nominally held by the infant king [[James V]] (lived 1512–42, reigned 1513–42), until he came of age in 1528.

[[Mary of Guise]] (lived 1515–60) was a French woman close to the French throne. She ruled as the regent for her teenaged daughter Queen Mary, 1554–60. The regent and her daughter were both strong proponents of Catholicism and attempted to suppress the rapidly Growth of Protestantism in Scotland. Mary of Guise was a strong opponent of Protestantism, and worked to maintain a close alliance between Scotland and France, called the [[Auld Alliance]]. In 1559 the Regent became alarmed that widespread Scottish hostility against French rule was strengthening the partisan cause, so she banned unauthorised preaching. But the fiery preacher [[John Knox]] sent Scotland aflame with his preaching, leading the coalition of powerful Scottish nobles, calling themselves the [[Lords of the Congregation]] raised the rebellion to overthrow the Catholic Church and seize its lands. The Lords appealed to Elizabeth for English help, but she played a very cautious hand. The 1559 treaty with France called for peace and she was unwilling to violate it, especially since England had no allies at the time. Supporting rebels against the lawful ruler violated Elizabeth's deeply held claims to the legitimacy of all royalty. On the other hand, a French victory in Scotland would establish a Catholic state on the northern border supported by a powerful French enemy. Elizabeth first sent money, then sent artillery, then sent a fleet that destroyed the French fleet in Scotland. Finally she sent 8,000 troops north. The death of Mary of Guise allowed England, France and Scotland to come to terms in the [[Treaty of Edinburgh]] in 1560, which had a far-reaching impact. France permanently withdrew all its forces from Scotland. It ensured the success of the Reformation in Scotland; it began a century of peace with France; it ended any threat of a Scottish invasion; and it paved the way for a union of the two kingdoms in 1603 when the Scottish king James VI inherited the English throne as James I and launched the Stuart era.&lt;ref&gt;Paul E.J. Hammer, ''Elizabeth's wars: war, government and society in Tudor England, 1544–1604'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

When the treaty was signed, Mary was in Paris as the wife of the French King [[Francis II of France|Francis II]]. When he died in 1561, she returned to Scotland as Queen of Scotland. However, when Elizabeth refused to recognise her as the heir to the English throne, Mary rejected the Treaty of Edinburgh. She made an unfortunate marriage to [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]] who mistreated her and murdered her Italian favourite [[David Rizzio]]. Darnley in turn was murdered by [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|the Earl of Bothwell]]. He was acquitted of murder; she quickly married Bothwell. Most people at the time thought she was deeply involved in adultery or murder; historians have argued at length and are undecided. However rebellion broke out and the Protestant nobles defeated the Queen's forces in 1567.&lt;ref&gt;Guy, ''Queen of Scots '', chapters 13–27&lt;/ref&gt; She was forced to abdicate in favour of her infant son James VI; she fled to England, where Elizabeth confined her and house arrest for 19 years. Mary engaged in numerous complex plots to assassinate Elizabeth and become queen herself. Finally Elizabeth caught her plotting the [[Babington Plot]] and had her executed in 1587.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''The Reign of Elizabeth'' pp 63–118,, 372–89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Loades, ''Elizabeth I'' (2003) pp 175–178, 220–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Troubled later years: 1585–1603====
Elizabeth's final two decades saw mounting problems that were left for the Stuarts to solve after 1603. John Cramsie, in reviewing the recent scholarship in 2003, argues:
: the period 1585–1603 is now recognised by scholars as distinctly more troubled than the first half of Elizabeth's long reign. Costly wars against Spain and the Irish, involvement in the Netherlands, socio-economic distress, and an authoritarian turn by the regime all cast a pall over Gloriana's final years, underpinning a weariness with the queen's rule and open criticism of her government and its failures.&lt;ref&gt;John Cramsie, "The Changing Reputations of Elizabeth I and James VI &amp; I," [http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/334 ''Reviews and History: Covering books and digital resources across all fields of history'' (review no. 334 June 2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;
Elizabeth remained a strong leader, but almost all of her earlier advisers had died or retired.  [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] (1563–1612) took over the role of leading advisor long held by his father [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley.]] [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]] (1567–1601) was her most prominent general, a role previously held by his stepfather [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]], who was the love of Elizabeth's life; and the adventurer/historian Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] (1552–1618) was a new face on the scene. The three new men formed a triangle of interlocking and opposing forces that was hard to break into. The first vacancy came in 1601, when Devereux was executed for attempting to take the Queen prisoner and seize power.&lt;ref&gt;Penry Williams, ''The Later Tudors: England, 1547–1603'' (1998) pp 325–28, 370–73.&lt;/ref&gt; After Elizabeth died the new king kept on Cecil as his chief advisor, and beheaded Raleigh.

==Popular uprisings==
{{See also|List of Tudor Rebellions}}
Numerous popular uprisings occurred; all suppressed by royal authorities. The largest were:
* The largest and most serious was the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]]. It disrupted the North of England in 1536 protesting the religious reforms of Henry VIII, his [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] and the policies of the King's chief minister, [[Thomas Cromwell]], as well as other specific political, social and economic grievances.&lt;ref&gt;M.L. Bush, "The Tudor polity and the pilgrimage of grace." ''Historical Research'' 80.207 (2007): 47–72. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2281.2006.00351.x/full online]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Prayer Book Rebellion]] or "Western Rising" was a popular revolt in Devon and Cornwall in 1549. The Royal Court introduced the ''Book of Common Prayer'', which was based on Protestant theology and the exclusive use of English. The change was widely unpopular – particularly in areas of still firmly Catholic religious loyalty, and in Cornwall where standard English was not popular.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Rose-Troup, ''The western rebellion of 1549: an account of the insurrections in Devonshire and Cornwall against religious innovations in the reign of Edward VI'', London: Smith, Elder, 1913 [https://archive.org/details/westernrebellion00rose online].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Kett's Rebellion]] began in 1549 in Norfolk; it started as a demonstration against [[enclosure]]s of common land. The instigator, Robert Kett, was executed for treason.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Fletcher and Diarmaid Macculloch, ''Tudor Rebellions'' (5th ed. 2004) pp. 69–83&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Wyatt's rebellion]] in 1554 against Queen Mary I's determination to marry Philip of Spain and named after [[Thomas Wyatt the Younger|Thomas Wyatt]], one of its leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher (2004) pp. 90-95&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Rising of the North]] or "Northern Rebellion" of 1569–70 was a failed attempt by Catholic nobles from Northern England to depose Queen Elizabeth I of England and replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots. It originated from bitter political factionalism in the royal Privy Concil. The extension of Tudor authority in northern England cause discontent among the aristocracy and gentry, as the new Protestant bishop tried to recover former church lands and alienated their new owners. Local Catholic elements were a large fraction of the population and resented the destruction of the rituals and practices. When the Royal army approached, the leadership disbanded their forces and fled to Scotland. A few leaders were executed, but many of the gentry saved their lives by handing over their lands to Queen Elizabeth.&lt;ref&gt;Fritze, ''Historical Dictionary of Tudor England'' pp 351–53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krista Kesselring, ''The Northern Rebellion of 1569: Faith, Politics and Protest in Elizabethan England'' (Springer, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local government==
The main officials of the local government operated at the county level (also called "shire") were the [[sheriff]] and the [[Lord Lieutenant]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Potts Cheyney, ''The European Background of American  History: 1300–1600'' (1904) pp 261–70. [https://archive.org/details/cu31924014479624 online]&lt;/ref&gt;   the power of the sheriff had declined since medieval days, but he was still very prestigious.  He was appointed for a one-year term, with no renewals, by the King's Privy Council.  He was paid many small fees, but they probably did not meet the sheriff's expenses in terms of hospitality and hiring his under-sheriffs and bailiffs.  The sheriff held court every month to deal with civil and criminal cases.  He supervised elections, ran the jail and meted out punishments.  His subordinates provided staffing for the county's justices of the peace.

The Lord Lieutenant was a new office created by Henry VIII to represent the royal power in each county. He was a person with good enough connections at court to be selected by the king and served at the king's pleasure, often for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Cheyney, ''The European Background'' (1904) pp 270–73.&lt;/ref&gt; He had  limited powers of direct control, so successful Lord Lieutenants  worked with his deputy lieutenants and  dealt with the  gentry through  compromise, consensus, and the inclusion of opposing factions.  He was in charge of mobilising the militia if necessary for defence, or to assist the king in military operations.  In [[Yorkshire]] in 1588, the Lord Lieutenant was the Earl of Huntington, who urgently needed to prepare defences in the face of the threatened invasion from the Spanish Armada.  The Queen's Privy Council urgently called upon him to mobilise the militia, and report on the availability of men and horses . Huntington's challenge was  to overcome the reluctance of many militia men, the  shortages of arms, training mishaps, and jealousy among the gentry as to who would command which unit. Despite Huntingdon's last-minute  efforts, the mobilisation of 1588 revealed a reluctant society that only grudgingly answered the call to arms.  The Armada never landed, and the militia were not actually used.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Braddick, "'Uppon This Instant Extraordinarie Occasion': Military Mobilization in Yorkshire before and after the Armada." ''Huntington Library Quarterly'' 61#3/4 (1998): 429–455.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the civil wars of the mid-17th century, the Lord Lieutenant played an even more important role in mobilising his county either for king or for Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Victor L. Stater,  ''Noble Government: the Stuart Lord Lieutenancy and the Transformation of English Politics'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

The day-to-day business of government was in the hands of  several dozen [[justice of the peace|justices of the peace]] (JP).  They handled all the real routine police administrative functions, and were paid through a modest level of fees.  Other local officials included constables,  church-wardens, mayors, and city aldermen.  The JP duties involved a great deal of paperwork – primarily in Latin – and attracted a surprisingly strong cast of candidates.  For example, The 55 JPs in [[Devon]]shire holding office in 1592 included:
:Sir [[Francis Drake]], Sir [[Ferdinando Gorges]], Gilberts, Carews, Seymours, Courtenays, and other names prominent among the men who laid the foundations of the maritime greatness of England and of the existence of America.  Of the fifty-five, twenty-eight were at one time or another high-sheriffs of the county, twenty more were then, or became afterwards, knights, six sat in the House of Commons, and three in the House of Lords.&lt;ref&gt;Cheyney, ''The European Background '' p 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social history and daily life==
The cultural achievements of the Elizabethan era have long attracted scholars, and since the 1960s they have conducted intensive research on the [[social history of England]].&lt;ref&gt;Penry Williams, ''The Later Tudors: England, 1547–1603'' (New Oxford History of England, 1998), chapters 6, 10, 11, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Morrill, ed., ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Tudor and Stuart Britain'' (1995) chapters 5 to 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.M. Palliser, ''The Age of Elizabeth: England Under the Later Tudors'' (2nd ed. 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Felicity Heal and Clive Holmes, eds., ''The gentry in England and Wales, 1500–1700'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There is elaborate detail in ''Shakespeare's England. An Account of the Life and Manners of his Age'' (2 vol. 1916). [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.458652 vol 1 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monarchs==
The [[House of Tudor]] produced five monarchs who ruled during this period (excluding [[Lady Jane Grey]]).

The Victorian Community History Awards are held annually to recognise the contributions made by Victorians in the preservation of the State’s history, and to recognise excellence in historical research. The effect of the VCHA over the period from 1998 to the present has been the stimulation of community history, the lifting of standards and the fostering of diversity and originality. &lt;ref&gt;The Victorian Community History Awards, by Carole Woods in ''Victorian Historical Journal'', June 2013, Vol 84 No 1, p 159.  Royal Historical Society of Victoria: Melbourne, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The '''Victorian Community History Awards''' were established and sponsored in 1997 by  '''Information [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]'''. The judges have always been appointed by the Royal Historical Society of Victoria, and among the first were Professor [[Weston Bate]], Professor [[A. G. L. Shaw]], and senior journalist at ''The Age'', John Lahey. &lt;ref&gt;The Victorian Community History Awards, by Carole Woods in ''Victorian Historical Journal'', June 2013, Vol 84 No 1, p 159.  Royal Historical Society of Victoria: Melbourne, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding was suspended in 2006 to provide additional funds for the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne.  After 2010 Information Victoria Bookshop withdrew support for the program, but after a vigorous campaign by the RHSV for the continuance of the Awards, the Baillieu government accepted a submission from the [[Public Record Office Victoria]] (PROV) to continue the program for a further four-year period. &lt;ref&gt;The Victorian Community History Awards, by Carole Woods in ''Victorian Historical Journal'', June 2013, Vol 84 No 1, p 159.  Royal Historical Society of Victoria: Melbourne, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;    

From 2011 the Awards were administered by the RHSV in partnership with PROV.&lt;ref&gt;The Victorian Community History Awards, by Carole Woods in ''Victorian Historical Journal'', June 2013, Vol 84 No 1, p 159.  Royal Historical Society of Victoria: Melbourne, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16783">'''War in History''' (''Krieg in der Geschichte'', KRiG) is a German non-fiction book series established in 1999. Published by [[Verlag Ferdinand Schöningh]], it focuses on the latest research in military history. The editors include historians {{illm|Stig Förster|de|Stig Förster}} of the [[University of Bern]], {{illm|Bernhard R. Kroener|de|Bernhard R. Kroener}} of the [[University of Potsdam]], [[Bernd Wegner]] of the [[Helmut Schmidt University]] and {{illm|Michael Werner (historian)|de|Michael Werner (Historiker)}} of the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]].

== Concept ==
The War in History series includes collections of essays or individual monographs, mostly in German (occasionally in English). Many of the works have been written as dissertations at German universities or research facilities, such as the [[Center for Military History and Social Sciences of the Bundeswehr]]. The publication in the series often explore the relationship between war and peace, as well as military and political means. For the editors of this series, investigations into the history of war cannot be carried out solely by "military considerations". Rather, historiographical diversity between foreign and domestic politics as well as society, economy and technology should be taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans-Jürgen Döscher]]: Review: Quinkert, Babette: ''Propaganda und Terror in Weißrussland 1941–1944'' by Babette Quinkert, ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', 12 April 2010, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
