'''Art history''' is the study of objects of art in their [[historical]] development and stylistic contexts; that is [[genre]], [[design]], [[:wikt:format|format]], and [[style (visual arts)|style]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=art%20history Art History]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". WordNet Search - 3.0, princeton.edu&lt;/ref&gt; The study includes painting, sculpture, architecture, ceramics, furniture, and other decorative objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/alex-potts/what-history-art|title=What is the History of Art? {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|access-date=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Art history is the history of different groups of people and their culture represented throughout their artwork. Art historians compare different time periods in art history. Such as a comparison to Medieval Art to Renaissance Art. This history of cultures is shown in their art work in different forms. Art can be shown by attire, architecture, religion, sports. Or more visual pieces of art such as paintings, drawings, sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;www.arthistory.net&lt;/ref&gt;

As a term, art history (its product being [[history of art]]) encompasses several methods of studying the [[visual arts]]; in common usage referring to works of art and architecture. Aspects of the discipline overlap. As the art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] once observed, "the field of art history [is] much like [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gaul]], divided in three parts inhabited by three different, though not necessarily hostile tribes: (i) the [[connoisseurship|connoisseurs]], (ii) the [[art criticism|critics]], and (iii) the academic art historians".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich (1996). ''The Essential Gombrich'', p. 7. London: Phaidon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, art history is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement; and [[art theory]] or "[[philosophy of art]]", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is [[aesthetics]], which includes investigating the enigma of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses [[historical method]] to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and how did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. The current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Cf: 'Art History versus Aesthetics', ed. James Elkins (New York: Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Art history is not only a [[biography|biographical]] endeavor. Art historians often root their studies in the scrutiny of individual objects. They thus attempt to answer in historically specific ways, questions such as: What are key features of this style?, What meaning did this object convey?, How does it function visually?, Did the artist meet their goals well?, What symbols are involved?, and Does it function discursively?

The historical backbone of the discipline is a celebratory chronology of beautiful creations commissioned by public or religious bodies or wealthy individuals in western Europe. Such a "[[Western canon|canon]]" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection of objects present in art history textbooks. Nonetheless, since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of non-Western art, art made by women, and vernacular creativity.

==Definition==
Art history as we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has precedents that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, but art historians also rely on [[formal analysis]], [[semiotics]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[iconography]]. Advances in photographic reproduction and printing techniques after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding [[contextualism|context]], [[Formalism (art)|form]], and social significance.

==Methodologies==
Art historians employ a number of [[methodology|methods]] in their research into the [[ontology]] and history of objects.

Art historians often examine work in the context of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and [[symbol]]ism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created.

Art historians also often examine work through an analysis of form; that is, the creator's use of [[wikt:line|line]], [[shape]], [[color]], [[wikt:texture|texture]], and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a [[two-dimensional]] picture plane or the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] of [[sculpture|sculptural]] or [[architecture|architectural]] space to create his or her art. The way these individual elements are employed results in [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[abstraction|non-representational]] art. Is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is ''realistic''. Is the artist not imitating, but instead relying on symbolism, or in an important way striving to capture nature's essence, rather than copy it directly? If so the art is non-representationalâalso called [[abstract art|abstract]]. Realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. [[Impressionism]] is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an "impression" of nature. If the work is not representational and is an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or is a search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is non-representational or a work of [[expressionism]].

An [[iconography|iconographical]] analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object.

Many art historians use [[critical theory]] to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from [[literature|literary scholars]], and it involves the application of a non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. [[Feminism|Feminist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Critical race theory|critical race]], [[Queer Theory|queer]], and [[Postcolonial theory|postcolonial]] theories are all well established in the discipline. As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined.

More recently, media and digital technology introduced possibilities of visual, spatial and experiential analyses. The relevant forms vary from movies, to interactive forms, including virtual environments, augmented environments, situated media, networked media, etc. The methods enabled by such techniques are in active development and promise to include qualitative approaches that can emphasize narrative, dramatic, emotional and ludic characteristics of history and art.&lt;ref&gt;Esche-Ramshorn, Christiane and Stanislav Roudavski (2012). [https://www.academia.edu/1841926/Evocative_Research_in_Art_History_and_Beyond_Imagining_Possible_Pasts_in_the_Ways_to_Heaven_Project Evocative Research in Art History and Beyond: Imagining Possible Pasts in the Ways to Heaven Project], Digital Creativity, 23, 1, pp. 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline of prominent methods==

===Pliny the Elder and ancient precedents===
The earliest surviving writing on art that can be classified as art history are the passages in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (c. AD 77-79), concerning the development of [[Ancient Greek art|Greek sculpture and painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/index.html First English Translation] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; From them it is possible to trace the ideas of [[Xenokrates of Sicyon]] (c. 280 BC), a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistorians.info/xenocrates Dictionary of Art Historians] Retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's work, while mainly an [[encyclopaedia]] of the sciences, has thus been influential from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. (Passages about techniques used by the painter [[Apelles]] c. (332-329 BC), have been especially well-known.) Similar, though independent, developments occurred in the 6th century China, where a canon of worthy artists was established by writers in the scholar-official class. These writers, being necessarily proficient in calligraphy, were artists themselves. The artists are described in the ''[[Six principles of Chinese painting|Six Principles of Painting]]'' formulated by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y0Pxz1L9I4EC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=The+Record+of+the+Classification+of+Old+Painters%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NOIDTggsRX&amp;sig=IiZrQ9RzW1ZVsDXKeNnXL5oI78o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r79dS7HHIMHElAeVzs3RBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Record%20of%20the%20Classification%20of%20Old%20Painters%22&amp;f=false, The shorter Columbia anthology of traditional Chinese literature, By Victor H. Mair, p.51] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vasari and artists' biographies===
[[File:Giorgio Vasari SelbstportrÃ¤t.jpg|thumb|Location|[[Giorgio Vasari]], ''[[Self-portrait]]'' c.1567]]
[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|[[Anton von Maron]], ''Portrait of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]],'' 1768]]
While personal reminiscences of art and artists have long been written and read (see [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] ''Commentarii,'' for the best early example),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/library/03/0319/t031930.asp Artnet artist biographies] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it was Giorgio Vasari, the Tuscan painter, sculptor and author of the ''[[Lives of the Painters]]'', who wrote the first true ''history'' of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLives.html website created by Adrienne DeAngelis, currently incomplete, intended to be unabridged, in English.] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized art's progression and development, which was a milestone in this field. His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was [[Michelangelo]], and Vasari's account is enlightening, though biased{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} in places.

Vasari's ideas about art were enormously influential, and served as a model for many, including in the north of Europe [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' and [[Joachim von Sandrart]]'s ''Teutsche Akademie''.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Vasari's approach held sway until the 18th century, when criticism was leveled at his biographical account of history.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Winckelmann and art criticism===
Scholars such as [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717â1768), criticised Vasari's "cult" of artistic personality, and they argued that the real emphasis in the study of art should be the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of art criticism. His two most notable works that introduced the concept of art criticism were ''Gedanken Ã¼ber die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst'', published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome ([[Henry Fuseli|Fuseli]] published an English translation in 1765 under the title ''Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks''), and ''Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums'' (''History of Art in Antiquity''), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase âhistory of artâ in the title of a book)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chilvers|first=Ian|title=The Oxford dictionary of art|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[Oxford]|isbn=0198604769|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winckelmann critiqued the artistic excesses of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] forms, and was instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober [[Neoclassicism]]. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818â1897), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. From Winckelmann until the mid-20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German-speaking academics. Winckelmann's work thus marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture.

Winckelmann was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laocoon]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for [[Karl Schnaase]]'s work. Schnaase's ''NiederlÃ¤ndische Briefe'' established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his ''Geschichte der bildenden KÃ¼nste'', one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by [[Franz Theodor Kugler]].

===WÃ¶lfflin and stylistic analysis===
:''See: [[Formal analysis]]''.
[[Heinrich WÃ¶lfflin]] (1864â1945), who studied under Burckhardt in Basel, is the "father" of modern art history. WÃ¶lfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Frida Schottmuller]]. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, focusing on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly by applying the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. He argued, among other things, that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their [[facade|faÃ§ades]] looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. By comparing individual paintings to each other, he was able to make distinctions of [[artistic|style]]. His book ''[[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]]'' developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to [[Giorgio Vasari]], WÃ¶lfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an "art history without names." Finally, he studied art based on ideas of [[nationhood]]. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently "Italian" and an inherently "[[Culture of Germany|German]]" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist [[Albrecht DÃ¼rer]].

===Riegl, Wickhoff, and the Vienna School===
{{Main article|Vienna School of Art History}}
Contemporaneous with WÃ¶lfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the [[University of Vienna]]. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Franz Wickhoff]], both students of [[Moritz Thausing]], and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of [[late antiquity]], which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque.

The next generation of professors at Vienna included [[Max DvoÅÃ¡k]], Julius von Schlosser, Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and [[Josef Strzygowski]]. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including [[Ernst Gombrich]], received their degrees at Vienna at this time. The term "Second Vienna School" (or "New Vienna School") usually refers to the following generation of Viennese scholars, including [[Hans Sedlmayr]], Otto PÃ¤cht, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of ''Kunstwollen'', and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of iconography, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestrained and irresponsible [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; PÃ¤cht, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s.

===Panofsky and iconography===
[[File:Aby Warburg.jpg|thumb| Photographer unknown, [[Aby Warburg]] c. 1900]]
Our 21st-century understanding of the symbolic content of art comes from a group of scholars who gathered in [[Hamburg]] in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Aby Warburg]], and [[Fritz Saxl]]. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues to be used in the 21st century by art historians. "Iconography"âwith roots meaning "symbols from writing" refers to subject matter of art derived from written sourcesâespecially scripture and mythology. "Iconology" is a broader term that referred to all symbolism, whether derived from a specific text or not. Today art historians sometimes use these terms interchangeably.

Panofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in later art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the [[University of Hamburg]], where Panofsky taught.

Warburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the [[Warburg Institute]]. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for a generation.

===Freud and psychoanalysis===
Heinrich WÃ¶lfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote a book on the artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in which he used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably [[homosexual]].
[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumbnail|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]; back row: [[Abraham A. Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[SÃ¡ndor Ferenczi]]]]
Though the use of posthumous material to perform psychoanalysis is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted. One of the best-known psychoanalytic scholars is Laurie Schneider Adams, who wrote a popular textbook, ''Art Across Time'', and a book ''Art and Psychoanalysis''.

An unsuspecting turn for the history of art criticism came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangeloâs Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo as one of the first psychology based analyses on a work of art.&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;Sigmund Freud. [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/burt/filmphilology/FreudMoses.pdf The Moses of MIchelangelo] The Standard Edition of the ''Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud''. Translated from the German under the general editorship of James Strachey in collaboration with Anna Freud, assisted by Alix Strachey and Alan Tyson. Volume XIII (1913-1914): Totem And Taboo and other Works. London. The Hogarth Press and The Institute Of Psycho-Analysis. 1st Edition, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasariâs ''Lives''. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.

===Jung and archetypes===
[[Carl Jung]] also applied psychoanalytic theory to art. [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]] was a [[Swiss]] [[psychiatrist]], an influential thinker, and founder of [[analytical psychology]]. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] through exploring the worlds of [[dream]]s, art, [[mythology]], world [[religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[sociology]], as well as [[literature]] and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological [[archetype]], the [[collective unconscious]], and his theory of [[synchronicity]]. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as [[coincidence]] were not merely due to [[randomness|chance]] but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a [[collective unconscious]] and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American [[Abstract expressionist]]s in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.&lt;/ref&gt; His work inspired the [[surrealist]] concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.

Jung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. [[Jackson Pollock]], for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jackson Pollock]] An American Saga, Steven Naismith and Gregory White Smith, Clarkson N. Potter publ. copyright 1989,''Archetypes and Alchemy'' pp. 327-338. {{ISBN|0-517-56084-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of psychoanalysis in art history has been profound, and extends beyond Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With [[Griselda Pollock]]'s reading of French feminist psychoanalysis and in particular the writings of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], as with Rosalind Krauss readings of [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Jean-FranÃ§ois Lyotard]] and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, [[Feminist theory]] written in the fields of [[French feminism]] and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.

===Marx and ideology===
During the mid-20th century, art historians embraced [[social history]] by using critical approaches. The goal was to show how art interacts with power structures in society. One critical approach that art historians{{who|date=November 2011}} used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural ([[ideology]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marcel Duchamp and Dada Movement jump started the Anti-art style. Various artist did not want to create artwork that everyone was conforming to at the time. These two movements helped other artist to create pieces that were not viewed as traditional art. Some examples of styles that branched off the anti-art movement would be Neo-Dadaism, Surrealism, and Constructivism. These styles and artist did not want to surrender to traditional ways of art. This way of thinking provoked political movements such as the Russian Revolution and the communist ideals.&lt;ref&gt; Gayford, Martin (18 February 2017).

Artist Isaak Brodsky work of art 'Shock-worker from Dneprstroi' in 1932 shows his political involvement within art. This piece of art can be analysed to show the internal troubles Soviet Russia was experiencing at the time.
Perhaps the best-known Marxist was [[Clement Greenberg]], who came to prominence during the late 1930s with his essay "[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay Greenberg claimed that the [[avant-garde]] arose in order to defend [[aesthetic]] standards from the decline of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] involved in [[consumerism|consumer society]], and seeing kitsch and art as opposites. Greenberg further claimed that [[avant-garde]] and [[Modernism|Modernist]] art was a means to resist the leveling of culture produced by [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[propaganda]]. Greenberg appropriated the German word '[[kitsch]]' to describe this consumerism, although its [[connotation]]s have since changed to a more affirmative notion of leftover materials of capitalist culture. Greenberg later{{when|date=November 2011}} became well known for examining the formal properties of modern art.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Meyer Schapiro]] is one of the best-remembered Marxist art historians of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], at which time he saw evidence of [[capitalism]] emerging and [[feudalism]] declining.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Arnold Hauser]] wrote the first Marxist survey of Western Art, entitled ''The Social History of Art''. He attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. The book was controversial when published during the 1950s since it makes generalizations about entire eras, a strategy now called "[[vulgar Marxism]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marxist Art History was refined in the department of Art History at [[UCLA]] with scholars such as T.J. Clark, O.K. Werckmeister, David Kunzle, Theodor W. Adorno, and Max Horkheimer. [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.J. Clark]] was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon [[vulgar Marxism]]. He wrote Marxist art histories of several [[impressionist]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] artists, including [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Ãdouard Manet]]. These books focused closely on the political and economic climates in which the art was created.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Feminist art history===
[[Linda Nochlin]]'s essay "[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]" helped to ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and remains one of the most widely read essays about female artists. This was then followed by a 1972 [[College Art Association]] Panel, chaired by Nochlin, entitled "Eroticism and the Image of Woman in Nineteenth-Century Art". Within a decade, scores of papers, articles, and essays sustained a growing momentum, fueled by the [[Second-wave feminism|Second-wave feminist movement]], of critical discourse surrounding women's interactions with the arts as both artists and subjects.  In her pioneering essay, Nochlin applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training, arguing that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nochlin|first1=Linda|title=Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?|journal=ARTnews|date=January 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success. [[Griselda Pollock]] is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above.

While feminist art history can focus on any time period and location, much attention has been given to the Modern era. Some of this scholarship centers on the [[feminist art movement]], which referred specifically to the experience of women. Often, feminist art history offers a critical "re-reading" of the Western art canon, such as Carol Duncan's re-interpretation of [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon#Feminist interpretation|Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]].  Two pioneers of the field are [[Mary Garrard]] and [[Norma Broude]]. Their anthologies ''Feminism and Art History: Questioning the Litany'', ''The Expanding Discourse: Feminism and Art History'', and ''Reclaiming Feminist Agency: Feminist Art History After Postmodernism'' are substantial efforts to bring feminist perspectives into the discourse of art history.  The pair also co-founded the [[Feminist Art History Conference]].

===Barthes and semiotics===
As opposed to iconography which seeks to identify meaning, [[semiotics]] is concerned with how meaning is created. [[Roland Barthes]]âs connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of [[denoted meaning]]âthe recognition of a visual sign, and the [[connoted meaning]]âthe instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up with ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.&lt;ref&gt;All ideas in this paragraph reference A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 31."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotic art history seeks to uncover the codified meaning or meanings in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;"S. Bann, 'Meaning/Interpretation', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 128."&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, [[Meyer Schapiro]] borrowed [[Saussure]]âs differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 213."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schapiro, to understand the meaning of frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a [[wikt:profile|profile]], or a [[Three-quarter profile|three-quarter view]]. Schapiro combined this method with the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirceâs concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''. By seeing the ''Mona Lisa'', for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or ''Mona Lisa''. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or âunlimited semiosisâ is endless; the art historianâs job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations as much as it is to reveal new possibilities.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24"&gt;"A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 24."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotics operates under the theory that an image can only be understood from the viewerâs perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even to the extent that an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24" /&gt; [[Rosalind Krauss]] espoused this concept in her essay âIn the Name of Picasso.â She denounced the artistâs monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. [[Mieke Bal]] argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, ''Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods'' (Manchester 2006) pp. 205-208."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum studies and collecting===
Aspects of the subject which have come to the fore in recent decades include interest in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. [[Museum studies]], including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting.

===New materialism===
Scientific advances have made possible much more accurate investigation of the materials and techniques used to create works, especially [[infra-red]] and [[x-ray]] photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of [[pigment]]s used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. [[Dendrochronology]] for [[panel painting]]s and [[radio-carbon dating]] for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and available on the internet or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Persian miniature]]s, and many types of archaeological artworks.

Concurrent to those technological advances, art historians have shown increasing interest in new theoretical approaches to the nature of artworks as objects. [[Thing theory]], [[actorânetwork theory]], and [[object-oriented ontology]] have played an increasing role in art historical literature.

===Nationalist art history===
The making of art, the academic history of art, and the history of art museums are closely intertwined with the rise of nationalism. Art created in the modern era, in fact, has often been an attempt to generate feelings of [[nationalism|national superiority]] or [[patriotism|love of oneâs country]]. [[Russian art#Visual arts|Russian art]] is an especially good example of this, as the [[Russian avant-garde]] and later [[Soviet art]] were attempts to define that countryâs identity.

Most art historians working today identify their specialty as the art of a particular culture and time period, and often such cultures are also nations. For example, someone might specialize in the 19th-century German or contemporary Chinese art history. A focus on nationhood has deep roots in the discipline. Indeed, [[Vasari]]'s [[Lives of the Artists]] is an attempt to show the superiority of Florentine artistic culture, and [[Heinrich WÃ¶lfflin]]'s writings (especially his monograph on [[Albrecht DÃ¼rer]]) attempt to distinguish Italian from German styles of art.

Many of the largest and most well-funded art museums of the world, such as the [[Louvre]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington are state-owned. Most countries, indeed, have a [[national museum|national gallery]], with an explicit mission of preserving the cultural patrimony owned by the governmentâregardless of what cultures created the artâand an often implicit mission to bolster that countryâs own [[cultural heritage]]. The National Gallery of Art thus showcases art made in the [[Visual arts of the United States|United States]], but also owns objects from across the world.

==Divisions by period==
The field of Art History is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions, with further sub-division based on media. Thus, someone might specialize in "19th-century German [[architecture]]" or in "16th-century [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] sculpture." Sub-fields are often included under a specialization. For example, the Ancient [[Near East]], Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of [[Ancient art]]. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus [[Korea]]n art, for example).

[[History of Art|Non-Western art]] is a relative newcomer to the Art Historical canon. Recent revisions of the semantic division between art and artifact have recast objects created in non-Western cultures in more aesthetic terms. Relative to those studying [[Ancient Rome]] or the [[Italian Renaissance]], scholars specializing in Africa, the [[Ancient Americas]] and Asia are a growing minority.

"Contemporary art history" refers to research into the period from the 1960s until today reflecting the break from the assumptions of [[modernism]] brought by artists of the [[neo-avant-garde]] and a continuity in contemporary art in terms of practice based on [[conceptualist]] and [[post-conceptualist]] practices.

==Professional organizations==
In the United States, the most important art history organization is the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeart.org/ College Art Association]&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes an annual conference and publishes the ''[[Art Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]''. Similar organizations exist in other parts of the world, as well as for specializations, such as [[architectural history]] and [[Renaissance]] art history. In the UK, for example, the [[Association of Art Historians]] is the premiere organization, and it publishes a journal titled ''[[Art History (journal)|Art History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aah.org.uk/ Association of Art Historians Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

J. 017.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Hans Holbein the Younger]]'s ''Noli me tangere'' a relatively rare Protestant oil painting of Christ from the Reformation period. It is small, and generally naturalistic in style, avoiding iconic elements like the [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], which is barely discernible.]]

The [[Protestant Reformation]] during the 16th century in Europe almost entirely rejected the existing tradition of Catholic art, and very often destroyed as much of it as it could reach.  A new artistic tradition developed, producing far smaller quantities of art that followed [[Protestant]] agendas and diverged drastically from the southern European tradition and the [[Renaissance humanist|humanist]] art produced during the [[High Renaissance]].  The [[Lutheran]] churches, as they developed, accepted a limited role for larger works of art in churches,&lt;ref name="Spicer2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt; and also encouraged prints and book illustrations.  [[Calvinist]]s remained steadfastly opposed to art in churches, and suspicious of small printed images of religious subjects, though generally fully accepting secular images in their homes. 

In turn, the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]] both reacted against and responded to Protestant criticisms of [[art in Roman Catholicism]] to produce a more stringent style of Catholic art.  Protestant religious art both embraced Protestant values and assisted in the proliferation of Protestantism, but the amount of religious art produced in Protestant countries was hugely reduced.  Artists in Protestant countries diversified into secular forms of art like [[history painting]], [[landscape painting]], [[portrait painting]] and [[still life]].

==Art and the Reformation==
[[File:Wittenberg Stadtkirche Cranachalter.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Cranach the Elder]]'s Altarpiece at [[Wittenberg]]. An early Lutheran work depicting leading Reformers as Apostles at the [[Last Supper]].]]
[[File:Altaarretabel Domkerk.JPG|thumb|300px|Altar piece in [[St. Martin's Cathedral, Utrecht]], attacked by Calvinists in the [[Beeldenstorm]] in 1566. This [[retable]] became visible again after restoration in 1919 removed the false wall placed in front of it.]]
The [[Protestant Reformation]] was a religious movement that occurred in Western Europe during the 16th century that resulted in a divide in Christianity between Roman Catholics and Protestants. This movement "created a North-South split in Europe, where generally Northern countries became Protestant, while Southern countries remained Catholic."&lt;ref&gt;''The Reformation and Counter-Reformation.'' Historicist and ''Causes of the Reformation.'' New Advent.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reformation produced two main branches of [[Protestantism]]; one was the Evangelical Lutheran churches, which followed the teachings of [[Martin Luther]], and the other the [[Reformed Churches]], which followed the ideas of [[John Calvin]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]].  Out of these branches grew three main sects, the [[Lutheran]] tradition, as well as the [[Continental Reformed]] and [[Anglican]] traditions, the latter two following the Reformed (Calvinist) faith.&lt;ref name="Picken2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Picken|first=Stuart D.B.|title=Historical Dictionary of Calvinism|date=16 December 2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|language=English|isbn=9780810872240|page=1|quote=While Germany and the Scandinavian countries adopted the Lutheran model of church and state, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Hungary, what is now the Czech Republic, and Scotland created Reformed Churches based, in varying ways, on the model Calvin set up in Geneva. Although England pursued the Reformation ideal in its own way, leading to the formation of the Anglican Communion, the theology of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England were heavily influenced by Calvinism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lutherans and Reformed Christians had different views regarding religious imagery.&lt;ref name="Nuechterlein2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nuechterlein|first=Jeanne Elizabeth|title=Holbein and the Reformation of Art|accessdate=29 April 2018|year=2000|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt;

[[Martin Luther]] in Germany allowed and encouraged the display of a restricted range of religious imagery in churches, seeing the Evangelical Lutheran Church as a continuation of the "ancient, apostolic church".&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt; The use of images was one of the issues where Luther strongly opposed the more radical [[Andreas Karlstadt]].  For a few years Lutheran altarpieces like [[Last Supper (Cranach)|the ''Last Supper'' by the younger Cranach]] were produced in Germany, especially by Luther's friend [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], to replace Catholic ones, often containing portraits of leading reformers as the apostles or other protagonists, but retaining the traditional [[depiction of Jesus]]. As such, "Lutheran worship became a complex ritual choreography set in a richly furnished church interior."&lt;ref name="Spicer2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spicer|first=Andrew|title=Lutheran Churches in Early Modern Europe|date=5 December 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|language=English|isbn=9781351921169|page=237|quote=As it developed in north-eastern Germany, Lutheran worship became a complex ritual choreography set in a richly furnished church interior. This much is evident from the background of an epitaph pained in 1615 by Martin Schulz, destined for the Nikolaikirche in Berlin (see Figure 5.5.).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lutherans proudly employed the use of the [[crucifix]] as it highlighted their high view of the [[Theology of the Cross]].&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MarquardtJordan2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marquardt|first1=Janet T.|last2=Jordan|first2=Alyce A.|title=Medieval Art and Architecture after the Middle Ages|date=14 January 2009|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|language=English|isbn=9781443803984|page=71|quote=In fact, Lutherans often justified their continued use of medieval crucifixes with the same arguments employed since the Middle Ages, as is evident from the example of the altar of the Holy Cross in the Cistercian church of Doberan.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories grew up of "indestructible" images of Luther, that had survived fires, by divine intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 89&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for Lutherans, "the Reformation renewed rather than removed the religious image."&lt;ref name="Dixon2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dixon|first=C. Scott|title=Contesting the Reformation|date=9 March 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|language=English|isbn=9781118272305|page=146|quote=According to Koerner, who dwells on Lutheran art, the Reformation renewed rather than removed the religious image.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand there was a wave of [[Iconoclasm#Reformation iconoclasm|iconoclasm]], or the destruction of religious imagery.  This began very early in the Reformation, when students in [[Erfurt]] destroyed a wooden altar in the [[Franciscan]] [[friary]] in December 1521.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, 19, note 12&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, Reformed Christianity showed consistent hostility to religious images, as [[idolatry]], especially [[sculpture]] and large paintings.  Book illustrations and prints were more acceptable, because they were smaller and more private.   Reformed leaders, especially [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]], actively eliminated imagery from churches within the control of their followers, and regarded the great majority of religious images as idolatrous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vor.org/rbdisk/html/institutes/index.html Institutes, 1:11, section 7 on crosses]&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction was often extremely divisive and traumatic within communities, an unmistakable physical manifestation, often imposed from above, that could not be ignored.  It was just for this reason that reformers favoured a single dramatic ''coup'', and many premature acts in this line sharply increased subsequent hostility between Catholics and Calvinists in communities{{snd}} for it was generally at the level of the city, town or village that such actions occurred, except in England and Scotland.  

But reformers often felt impelled by strong personal convictions, as shown by the case of Frau GÃ¶ldli, on which Zwingli was asked to advise.  She was a Swiss lady who had once made a promise to [[Apollinaris of Ravenna|Saint Apollinaris]] that if she recovered from an illness she would donate an image of the saint to a local convent, which she did. Later she turned Protestant, and feeling she must reverse what she now saw as a wrong action, she went to the convent church, removed the statue and burnt it. Prosecuted for [[blasphemy]], she paid a small fine without complaint, but flatly refused to pay the additional sum the court ordered be paid to the convent to replace the statue, putting her at risk of serious penalties.  Zwingli's letter advised trying to pay the nuns a larger sum on condition they did not replace the statue, but the eventual outcome is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 87-88&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of his life, after iconoclastic shows of force became a feature of the early phases of the [[French Wars of Religion]], even Calvin became alarmed and criticised them, realizing that they had become counter-productive.&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 73-74&lt;/ref&gt;      
[[File:St. Michaelis Oberkleen Blick nach Westen 02.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Daniel Hisgen]]'s paintings are mostly cycles on the parapets of Lutheran church galleries.  Here the Creation (left) to the [[Annunciation]] can be seen.]]

Subjects prominent in Catholic art other than Jesus and events in the [[Christian Bible|Bible]], such as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and saints were given much less emphasis or disapproved of in Protestant theology.  As a result, in much of northern Europe, the Church virtually ceased to commission figurative art, placing the dictation of content entirely in the hands of the artists and lay consumers.  Calvinism even objected to non-religious [[funerary art]], such as the [[heraldry]] and effigies beloved of the Renaissance rich.&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;  Where there was religious art, iconic images of [[Christ]] and scenes from the Passion became less frequent, as did portrayals of the saints and clergy.  Narrative scenes from the Bible, especially as book illustrations and prints, and, later, moralistic depictions of modern life were preferred. Both Cranachs painted allegorical scenes setting out Lutheran doctrines, in particular a series on ''[[Law and Gospel (Cranach)|Law and Gospel]]''.  [[Daniel Hisgen]], a German [[Rococo]] painter of the 18th century in [[Upper Hesse]], specialized in cycles of biblical paintings decorating the front of the gallery parapet in Lutheran churches with an upper gallery, a less prominent position that satisfied Lutheran scruples.  Wooden organ cases were also often painted with similar scenes to those in Catholic churches.

Lutherans strongly defended their existing sacred art from a new wave of Calvinist-on-Lutheran iconoclasm in the second half of the century, as Calvinist rulers or city authorities attempted to impose their will on Lutheran populations in the "[[Second Reformation]]" of about 1560-1619.&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamport|first=Mark A.|title=Encyclopedia of Martin Luther and the Reformation|date=31 August 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781442271593|page=138|quote=Lutherans continued to worship in pre-Reformation churches, generally with few alterations to the interior. It has even been suggested that in Germany to this day one finds more ancient Marian altarpieces in Lutheran than in Catholic churches. Thus in Germany and in Scandinavia many pieces of medieval art and architecture survived. Joseph Leo Koerner has noted that Lutherans, seeing themselves in the tradition of the ancient, apostolic church, sought to defend as well as reform the use of images. "An empty, white-washed church proclaimed a wholly spiritualized cult, at odds with Luther's doctrine of Christ's real presence in the sacraments" (Koerner 2004, 58). In fact, in the 16th century some of the strongest opposition to destruction of images came not from Catholics but from Lutherans against Calvinists: "You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return" (Koerner 2004, 58). Works of art continued to be displayed in Lutheran churches, often including an imposing large crucifix in the sanctuary, a clear reference to Luther's ''theologia crucis''. ... In contrast, Reformed (Calvinist) churches are strikingly different. Usually unadorned and somehwat lacking in aesthetic appeal, pictures, sculptures, and ornate altar-pieces are largely absent; there are few or no candles; and crucifixes or crosses are also mostly absent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 84. [https://books.google.com/books?id=lQjGmEUtbPMC&amp;pg=PA84 Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; Against the Reformed, Lutherans exclaimed: "You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return".&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt; The [[Beeldenstorm]], a large and very disorderly wave of Calvinist mob destruction of Catholic images and church fittings that spread through the [[Low Countries]] in the summer of 1566 was the largest outbreak of this sort, with drastic political repercussions.&lt;ref name="Kleiner2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: A Concise History of Western Art|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|language=English |isbn=9781424069224|page=254|quote=In an episode known as the Great Iconoclasm, bands of Calvinists visited Catholic churches in the Netherlands in 1566, shattering stained-glass windows, smashing statues, and destroying paintings and other artworks they perceived as idolatrous.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign of Calvinist iconoclasm "provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs" in Germany and "antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox" in the Baltic region.&lt;ref name="Marshall2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=The Reformation|date=22 October 2009|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|isbn=9780191578885|page=114|quote=Iconoclastic incidents during the Calvinist 'Second Reformation' in Germany provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs, while Protestant image-breaking in the Baltic region deeply antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox, a group with whom reformers might have hoped to make common cause.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar patterns to the German actions, but with the addition of encouragement and sometimes finance from the national government, were seen in Anglican England in the [[English Civil War]] and [[English Commonwealth]] in the next century, when more damage was done to art in medieval parish churches than during the [[English Reformation]].

A major theological difference between Protestantism and [[Catholicism]] is the question of [[transubstantiation]], or the literal transformation of the Communion wafer and wine into the body and blood of Christ, though both Lutheran and Reformed Christians affirmed the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]], the former as a [[sacramental union]] and the latter as a [[pneumatic presence]].&lt;ref name="MattoxRoeber2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mattox|first1=Mickey L.|last2=Roeber|first2=A. G.|title=Changing Churches: An Orthodox, Catholic, and Lutheran Theological Conversation|date=27 February 2012|publisher=Wm. B.

They are at the same time body and blood, bread and wine. This divine food is given, more-over, not just for the strengthening of faith, nor only as a sign of our unity in faith, nor merely as an assurance of the forgiveness of sin. Even more, in this sacrament the Lutheran Christian receives the very body and blood of Christ precisely for the strengthening of the union of faith. The "real presence" of Christ in the Holy Sacrament is the means by which the union of faith, effected by God's Word and the sacrament of baptism, is strengthened and mantained. Intimate union with Christ, in other words, leads directly to the most intimate communion in his holy body and blood.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Protestant churches that were not participating in the iconoclasm often selected as altarpieces scenes depicting the Last Supper.  This helped the worshippers to recall their theology behind the [[Eucharist]], as opposed to Catholic churches, which often chose crucifixion scenes for their altarpieces to remind the worshippers that the sacrifice of Christ and the sacrifice of the Mass were one and the same, via the literal transformation of the Eucharist.

The Protestant Reformation also capitalized on the popularity of [[printmaking]] in northern Europe. Printmaking allowed images to be mass-produced and widely available to the public at low cost. This allowed for the widespread availability of visually persuasive imagery. The Protestant church was therefore able, as the Catholic Church had been doing since the early 15th century, to bring their theology to the people, and religious education was brought from the church into the homes of the common people, thereby forming a direct link between the worshippers and the divine.

There was also a violent propaganda war fought partly with [[popular prints]] by both sides; these were often highly scurrilous caricatures of the other side and their doctrines.  On the Protestant side, portraits of the leading reformers were popular, and their likenesses sometimes represented the Apostles and other figures in Biblical scenes such as the [[Last Supper]].

== Genre and landscape ==

After the early years of the reformation, artists in Protestant areas painted far fewer religious subjects for public display, although there was a conscious effort to develop a Protestant [[iconography]] of Bible illustration in book illustrations and [[old master print|prints]].  In the early Reformation artists, especially [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach the Elder]] and [[Lucas Cranach the Younger|Younger]] and [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], made paintings for churches showing the leaders of the reformation in ways very similar to Catholic saints.  Later Protestant taste turned from the display in churches of religious scenes, although some continued to be displayed in homes.  There was also a reaction against large images from classical mythology, the other manifestation of high style at the time.  This brought about a style that was more directly related to accurately portraying the present times. The traditions of landscapes and genre paintings that would fully flower in the 17th century began during this period.

[[Peter Bruegel]] (1525â1569) of Flanders is the great genre painter of his time, who worked for both Catholic and Protestant patrons.  In most of his paintings, even when depicting religious scenes, most space is given to landscape or peasant life in 16th century Flanders.  Bruegelâs ''Wedding Feast'', portrays a Flemish-peasant wedding dinner in a barn, which makes no reference to any religious, historical or classical events, and merely gives insight into the everyday life of the Flemish peasant. Another great painter of his age, [[Lucas van Leyden]] (1489â1533), is known mostly for his [[engraving]]s, such as ''The Milkmaid'', which depicts peasants with milk cows.  This engraving, from 1510, well before the Reformation,  contains no reference to religion or [[classicism]], although much of his other work features both.

[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ã. 011.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Peter Bruegel]]'s ''Peasant Wedding Feast''.]]
Bruegel was also an accomplished landscape painter. Frequently Bruegel painted agricultural landscapes, such as ''Summer'' from his famous set of the seasons, where he shows peasants harvesting wheat in the country, with a few workers taking a lunch break under a nearby tree. This type of landscape painting, apparently void of religious or classical connotations, gave birth to a long line of northern European landscape artists, such as [[Jacob van Ruisdael]].

With the great development of the engraving and printmaking market in [[Antwerp]] in the 16th century, the public was provided with accessible and affordable images. Many artists provided drawings to book and print publishers, including Bruegel. In 1555 Bruegel began working for ''The Four Winds'', a publishing house owned by [[Hieronymus Cock]]. ''The Four Winds'' provided the public with almost a thousand [[etching]]s and engravings over two decades. Between 1555 and 1563 Bruegel supplied Cock with almost 40 drawings, which were engraved for the Flemish public.

The courtly style of [[Northern Mannerism]] in the second half of the century has been seen as partly motivated by the desire of rulers in both the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and France to find a style of art that could appeal to members of the courtly elite on both sides of the religious divide.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, 98-101 on Rudolf, and Strong, Pt. 2, Chapter 3 on France, especially pp. 98-101, 112-113.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus religious controversy had the rather ironic effect of encouraging [[classical mythology]] in art, since though they might disapprove, even the most stern Calvinists could not credibly claim that 16th century mythological art really represented idolatry.

==Council of Trent==
[[File:Last Judgement (Michelangelo).jpg|thumb|[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]] fresco in the [[Sistine Chapel]] by [[Michelangelo]] (1534-41) came under persistent attack in the [[Counter-Reformation]] for, among other things, nudity (later painted over for several centuries), not showing Christ seated or bearded, and including the pagan figure of [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]].]]

During the Reformation a great divergence arose between the [[Catholic Church]] and the Protestant Reformers of the north regarding the content and style of art work. The Catholic Church viewed Protestantism and Reformed iconoclasm as a threat to the church and in response came together at the [[Council of Trent]] to institute some of their own reforms. The church felt that much religious art in Catholic countries (especially Italy) had lost its focus on religious subject-matter, and became too interested in material things and decorative qualities.  The council came together periodically between 1545 and 1563. The reforms that resulted from this council are what set the basis for what is known as the [[Counter-Reformation]].

Italian painting after the 1520s, with the notable exception of the art of [[Venice]], developed into [[Mannerism]], a highly sophisticated style, striving for effect, that concerned many churchman as lacking appeal for the mass of the population.  Church pressure to restrain religious imagery affected art from the 1530s and resulted in the decrees of the final session of the  [[Council of Trent]] in 1563 including short and rather inexplicit passages concerning religious images, which were to have great impact on the development of Catholic art.  Previous Catholic [[Church council]]s had rarely felt the need to pronounce on these matters, unlike [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] ones which have often ruled on specific types of images.

Statements are often made along the lines of "The [[decrees]] of the Council of Trent stipulated that art was to be direct and compelling in its narrative presentation, that it was to provide an accurate presentation of the biblical narrative or saintâs life, rather than adding incidental and imaginary moments, and that it was to encourage [[piety]]",&lt;ref&gt;''Art in Renaissance Italy.'' Paoletti, John T., and Gary M. Radke. Pg. 514.&lt;/ref&gt; but in fact the actual decrees of the council were far less explicit than this, though all of these points were probably in line with their intentions. The very short passage dealing with art came only in the final session in 1563, as a last minute and little-discussed addition, based on a French draft. The decree confirmed the traditional doctrine that images only represented the person depicted, and that veneration to them was paid to the person themself, not the image, and further instructed that:&lt;blockquote&gt; ...every superstition shall be removed ... all lasciviousness be avoided; in such wise that figures shall not be painted or adorned with a beauty exciting to lust... there be nothing seen that is disorderly, or that is unbecomingly or confusedly arranged, nothing that is profane, nothing indecorous, seeing that holiness becometh the house of God.

And that these things may be the more faithfully observed, the holy Synod ordains, that no one be allowed to place, or cause to be placed, any unusual image, in any place, or church, howsoever exempted, except that image have been approved of by the bishop ...&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct25.html Text of the 25th decree of the Council of Trent]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The number of decorative treatments of religious subjects declined sharply, as did "unbecomingly or confusedly arranged" Mannerist pieces, as a number of books, notably by the Flemish theologian [[Molanus]], Saint [[Charles Borromeo]] and Cardinal [[Gabriele Paleotti]], and instructions by local bishops, amplified the decrees, often going into minute detail on what was acceptable.  Many traditional iconographies considered without adequate scriptural foundation were in effect prohibited, as was any inclusion of classical pagan elements in religious art, and almost all nudity, including that of the infant Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Blunt|Blunt Anthony]], ''Artistic Theory in Italy, 1450-1660'', chapter VIII, especially pp. 107-128, 1940 (refs to 1985 edn), [[OUP]], {{ISBN|0-19-881050-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the great medievalist [[Ãmile MÃ¢le]], this was "the death of medieval art".&lt;ref&gt;[http://danielmitsui.tripod.com/aaaaa/deathart.html The death of Medieval Art]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Extract from book by [[Ãmile MÃ¢le]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art and the Counter-Reformation ==
[[File:Lamentation Scipione Pulzone.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Scipione Pulzone]]'s ''[[Lamentation of Christ|Lamentation]]'', a typical Counter-Reformation work.]]

While Calvinists largely removed public art from religion and Reformed societies moved towards more "secular" forms of art which might be said to glorify God through the portrayal of the "natural beauty of His creation and by depicting people who were created in His image",&lt;ref&gt;''Art of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation.'' Nosotro, Rit.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Counter-Reformation]] Catholic church continued to encourage religious art, but insisted it was strictly religious in content,  glorifying God and Catholic traditions, including the [[sacraments]] and the [[saints]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Art of the Counter Reformation.'' [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, "Lutheran places of worship contain images and sculptures not only of Christ but also of biblical and occasionally of other saints as well as prominent decorated pulpits due to the importance of preaching, stained glass, ornate furniture, magnificent examples of traditional and modern architecture, carved or otherwise embellished altar pieces, and liberal use of candles on the altar and elsewhere."&lt;ref name="Lamport"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamport|first=Mark A.|title=Encyclopedia of Martin Luther and the Reformation|date=31 August 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=9781442271593|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference between Lutheran and Roman Catholic places of worship was the presence of the [[tabernacle]] in the latter.&lt;ref name="Lamport"/&gt;

[[Sydney Joseph Freedberg]], who invented the term ''[[Counter-Maniera]]'', cautions against connecting this more austere style in religious painting, which spread from Rome from about 1550, too directly with the decrees of Trent, as it pre-dates these by several years. He describes the decrees as "a codifying and official sanction of a temper that had come to be conspicuous in Roman culture".&lt;ref&gt;(Sidney) Freedberg, 427â428, 427 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scipione Pulzone]]'s (1550â1598) painting of the [[Lamentation of Christ|Lamentation]] which was commissioned for the [[Church of the GesÃ¹]] in 1589 is a ''[[Counter-Maniera]]'' work that gives a clear demonstration of what the holy council was striving for in the new style of religious art. With the focus of the painting giving direct attention to the crucifixion of Christ, it complies with the religious content of the council and shows the story of the passion while keeping Christ in the image of the ideal human.

[[File:Paolo Veronese.jpg|thumb|320px|[[Paolo Veronese]]'s ''Last Supper ([[The Feast in the House of Levi]])'']]
Ten years after the Council of Trent's decree [[Paolo Veronese]] was summoned by the [[Inquisition]] to explain why his ''Last Supper'', a huge canvas for the [[refectory]] of a monastery, contained, in the words of the Inquisition: "buffoons, drunken Germans, dwarfs and other such scurrilities" as well as extravagant costumes and settings, in what is indeed a fantasy version of a Venetian patrician feast.&lt;ref name="Transcript of Veronese's testimony"&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/Veronese.html Transcript of Veronese's testimony]&lt;/ref&gt;  Veronese was told that he must change his indecorous painting within a three-month period - in fact he just changed the title to ''[[The Feast in the House of Levi]]'', still an episode from the Gospels, but a less doctrinally central one, and no more was said.&lt;ref name="David Rostand 1997"&gt;David Rostand, ''Painting in Sixteenth-Century Venice: Titian, Veronese, Tintoretto'', 2nd ed 1997, Cambridge UP {{ISBN|0-521-56568-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; No doubt any Protestant authorities would have been equally disapproving.  The pre-existing decline in "[[donor portrait]]s" (those who had paid for an altarpiece or other painting being placed within the painting) was also accelerated; these become rare after the Council.

[[File:Las lagrimas de san Pedro El Greco 1580.jpg|thumb|240px|''Repentance of Peter'' by [[El Greco]], 1580â1586.]]
Further waves of "Counter-Reformation art" occurred when areas formerly Protestant were again brought under Catholic rule. The churches were normally empty of images, and such periods could represent a boom time for artists. The best known example is the new [[Spanish Netherlands]] (essentially modern [[Belgium]]), which had been the centre of Protestantism in the Netherlands but became (initially) exclusively Catholic after the Spanish drove the Protestants to the north, where they established the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]].  [[Rubens]] was one of a number of [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque painters]] who received many commissions, and produced several of his best known works re-filling the empty churches.&lt;ref&gt;(David) Freedberg, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;  Several cities in France in the [[French wars of religion]] and in Germany, [[Bohemia]] and elsewhere in the [[Thirty Years War]] saw similar bursts of restocking.

The rather extreme pronouncement by a synod in [[Antwerp]] in 1610 that in future the central panels of altarpieces should only show New Testament scenes was certainly ignored in the cases of many paintings by [[Rubens]] and other Flemish artists (and in particular the [[Jesuits]] continued to commission altarpieces centred on their saints, but nonetheless New Testament subjects probably did increase.&lt;ref&gt;(David) Freedberg, 139-140&lt;/ref&gt;  Altarpieces became larger and more easy to make out from a distance, and the large painted or gilded carved wooden altarpieces that were the pride of many northern late medieval cities were often replaced with paintings.&lt;ref&gt;(David) Freedberg, 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Some subjects were given increased prominence to reflect Counter-Reformation emphases. The ''[[Repentance of Peter]]'', showing the end of the episode of the ''[[Denial of Peter]]'', was not often seen before the Counter-Reformation, when it became popular as an assertion of the [[sacrament]] of [[Confession (religion)|Confession]] against Protestant attacks.  This  followed an influential book by the [[Jesuit]] Cardinal [[Robert Bellarmine]] (1542â1621).   The image typically shows Peter in tears, as a half-length portrait with no other figures, often with hands clasped as at right, and sometimes "the [[rooster|cock]]" in the background; it was often coupled with a repentant [[Mary Magdalen]], another exemplar from Bellarmine's book.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, pp. 10 and 315&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Counter-Reformation grew stronger and the Catholic Church felt less threat from the Protestant Reformation, [[Rome]] once again began to assert its [[universality (philosophy)|universality]] to other nations around the world. The religious order of the [[Jesuits]] or the Society of Jesus, sent missionaries to the [[Americas]], parts of [[Africa]], [[India]] and [[eastern Asia]] and used the arts as an effective means of articulating their message of the Catholic Church's dominance over the Christian [[faith]]. The Jesuits' impact was so profound during their missions of the time that today very similar styles of art from the Counter-Reformation period in Catholic Churches are found all over the world.

Despite the differences in approaches to religious art, stylistic developments passed about as quickly across religious divisions as within the two "blocs".  Artistically Rome remained in closer touch with the Netherlands than with Spain.

A '''Bachelor of Environmental Science''' is an [[undergraduate]] [[bachelor's degree]] awarded for courses taken in the study of [[environmental science]] or related disciplines, such as sustainable resource development, [[environmental health]], or [[ecological sustainability]], and may also be known as a Bachelor of Environmental Science and Management degree in some schools. This is a interdisciplinary degree course, some universities offers four year honors degree programme  

The Bachelor of Environmental Science degree is frequently abbreviated as '''B.Env.Sc.''', (sometimes B.E.Sc, B.S.E.S, or even B.E.S - the latter of which can cause confusion with a Bachelor of Environmental ''Studies'' degree) especially in the use of post-nominals where an Environmental Studies degree may be either B.S. or B.A.

In Australia, those who graduate with a B.Env.Sc. are eligible for membership in the [[Environment Institutes|Environment Institute of Australian and New Zealand]].

A '''biosand filter''' (BSF) is a point-of-use water treatment system adapted from traditional [[slow sand filter]]s. Biosand filters remove pathogens and suspended solids from water using biological and physical processes that take place in a sand column covered with a [[biofilm]]. BSFs have been shown to remove heavy metals, turbidity, bacteria, viruses and protozoa.&lt;ref name="Elliot"&gt;Elliott, M., Stauber, C., Koksal, F., DiGiano, F., and M. Sobsey (2008). Reduction of E. coli, echovirus type 12 and bacteriophages in an intermittently operated 2 household-scale slow sand filter.Water Research, Volume 42, Issues 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"&gt;{{cite web|title=CAWST Biosand Filter Manual 2008|url=http://itacanet.org/eng/water/Section%206%20Water%20treatment/Biosand_filter_CAWST.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; BSFs also reduce discoloration, odor and unpleasant taste. Studies have shown a correlation between use of BSFs and a decrease in the occurrence of [[diarrhea]].&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"&gt;{{cite web|title=CAWST Biosand Filter|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/resources/biosand-filter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their effectiveness, ease of use, and lack of recurring costs, biosand filters are often considered [[appropriate technology]] in developing countries. It is estimated that over 200,000 BSFs are in use worldwide.&lt;ref name="Elliot" /&gt;

==History==

The household biosand filter was proposed by Dr. David Manz in the late 1980s at the [[University of Calgary]], Canada.&lt;ref name="CAWSTHistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=CAWST History|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/about-us/history}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was developed from the [[slow sand filter]], a technology that has been used for drinking water purification since the 1800s.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"/&gt; Initial lab and field tests were conducted in 1991; the system was patented in 1993 &lt;ref name="CAWSTHistory"/&gt; and was implemented in the field in [[Nicaragua]]. The Canadian non-profit company [[Center for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technology]] ([[CAWST]]) was co-founded in 2001 by David Manz and [[Camille Dow Baker]] to promote education and training in water purification and sanitation including using this technology, and to continue developing it.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"/&gt; A privately owned company, Hydraid Biosand Water Filter  produces and distributes plans for filters.&lt;ref name="HydraidBSFTech"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydraid Biosand Technology|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/resources/biosand-filter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biosand filter components==

[[File:Ohorizons Concrete BioSand Filter.png|thumb|Basic Diagram of a Concrete BioSand Filter]]

Biosand filters are typically constructed from concrete or plastic.&lt;ref name="HydraidBSFTech"/&gt; At the top of the filter, a tightly fitted lid prevents contamination and unwanted pests from entering the filter. Below this, the diffuser plate prevents disturbance of the [[biofilm]] when water is poured into the filter. Water then travels through the sand column, which removes pathogens and suspended solids. Below the sand column, a layer of gravel prevents sand from entering the drainage layer and clogging the outlet tube. Below the separating layer is the drainage layer consisting of coarser gravel that prevents clogging near the base of the outlet tube.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"/&gt;

== Filtration process ==
Pathogens and suspended solids are removed by biological and physical processes that take place in the biolayer and the sand layer. These processes include:
*'''Mechanical trapping:''' Suspended solids and pathogens are trapped in the spaces between the sand grains.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;
*'''Predation:''' Pathogens are consumed by microorganisms in the biolayer.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;
*'''Adsorption:''' Pathogens are absorbed into each other and to suspended solids in the water and sand grains.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;
*'''Natural death:''' Pathogens finish their life cycles or die because there is not enough food or oxygen.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

===During the run===
The high water level (hydraulic head) in the inlet reservoir zone pushes the water through the diffuser and filter, then decreases as water flows evenly through the sand. The flow rate slows because there is less pressure to force the water through the filter. The inlet water contains dissolved oxygen, nutrients, and contaminants. It provides the oxygen required by the microorganisms in the biofilm. Large suspended particles and pathogens are trapped in the top of the sand and partially plug the pore spaces between the sand grains. This causes the flow rate to decrease.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

===Pause period (idle time)===

Idle time typically comprises greater than 80% of the daily cycle; during this time, microbial attenuation processes are likely to be significant. Most removal occurs where water is in contact with the biofilm. The processes that occur in the biofilm have not been identified.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; When the standing water layer reaches the level of the outlet tube, the flow stops.  Ideally, this should be high enough to keep the biofilm in the sand layer wet and allow oxygen to diffuse through the standing water to the biolayer.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; The pause period allows microorganisms in the biolayer to consume the pathogens and nutrients in the water. The rate of flow through the filter is restored as they are consumed. If the pause period is too long, the biolayer will consume all of the pathogens and nutrients and will die, reducing the efficiency of the filter when it is used again. The pause period should be between 1 and 48 hours.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; Pathogens in the non-biological zone die from a lack of nutrients and oxygen.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

==Maintenance==
Over time, particles accumulate between the filter's sand grains. As more water is poured, a biofilm forms along the top of the diffuser plate. Both of these occurrences cause a decrease in flow rate (clogging and [[bioclogging]]). Although slower flow rates generally improve water filtration due to idle time [APS1], it may become too slow for the usersâ convenience. If flow rates fall below 0.1 litres/minute, it is recommended by CAWST to perform maintenance.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"/&gt; The "swirl and dump", or wet harrowing cleaning technique, is used to restore flow rate. About {{Convert|1|USgal|l}} is poured into the filter before cleaning (assuming the filter is empty). The upper layer of sand is then swirled in a circular motion. Dirty water from the swirling is dumped out and the sand is smoothed out at the top. This process is repeated until flow rate is restored.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"/&gt; Cleaning the diffuser plate, outlet tube, lid, and outside surfaces of the filters regularly is also recommended.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"/&gt; Long-term sustainability and efficacy of biosand filters depends on education and support from knowledgeable support personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sisson|first=Andrew J.|author2=Wampler, PJ |author3=Rediske RR |author4= Molla AR |title=An assessment of long-term biosand filter use and sustainability in the Artibonite Valley near Deschapelles, Haiti|journal=Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development|date=January 2013|volume=3|issue=1|pages=51â60|doi=10.2166/washdev.2013.092|url=http://www.iwaponline.com/washdev/003/washdev0030051.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clean Water for Haiti, a non-profit in Haiti implements an education and follow-up program post-installation of the biosand filter. The program includes visits to the beneficiary homes after one, three and twelve months and another at 5 years from installation date. During each visit, beneficiaries receive repeated instruction about safe water practices and how to take care of the filter. Based on data collected since 2010, between 94% and 99% of filters are still being used regularly 12 months after installation. &lt;ref&gt;cleanwaterforhaiti.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Removal of contaminants==

===Turbidity===
Results for turbidity reductions vary depending on the turbidity of the influent water. Turbid water contains sand, silt and clay.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"/&gt;  Feed turbidity in one study ranged from 1.86 to 3.9 NTU.  In a study water was obtained from sample taps of water treatment plants from three local reservoirs. It poured through a slow sand filter and results showed that turbidity decreased to a mean of 1.45 NTU.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; In another study using surface water a 93% reduction in turbidity was observed.&lt;ref name="Household Water Treatment Systems"/&gt; As the biofilm above the sand ripens, turbidity removal increases.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; Although biosand filters remove much turbidity, slow sand filters, which have a slower filtration rate, remove more.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

===Heavy metals===
There is limited research on the removal of heavy metals by biosand filters.  In a study conducted in South Africa, the filter removed about 64% of iron and 5% of magnesium.&lt;ref name="Household Water Treatment Systems"&gt;Mwabi, J.K., F.E. Adeyemo and T.O. Mamba. "Household Water Treatment Systems: A Solution to the Production of Safe Drinking." SAO/NASA ADS: ADS Home Page. Web. 22 Dec. 2011. http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011PCE....36.1120M&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacteria===
In laboratory studies, the biosand filter has been found to remove about 98-99% of bacteria.&lt;ref name="Household Water Treatment Systems"/&gt; In removal of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' it was found that the biosand filter may increase due to biofilm formation over about two months. The removal after this time ranged from 97-99.99% depending on the daily water volume and percent primary effluent added. The addition of primary effluent or waste water facilitates growth of the biofilm which aids bacterial die-off.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; Research shows that biosand filters in use in the field remove fewer bacteria than ones in a controlled environment.  In research conducted in 55 households of [[Bonao]], Dominican Republic, the average E. coli reduction was about 93 percent.&lt;ref name="Stauber"/&gt;

===Viruses===
Lab tests have shown that while the filters reduce significant quantities of  E. coli, they remove significantly fewer viruses because viruses are smaller.  In a study using bacteriophages, virus removal ranged between 85% and 95% after 45 days of usage.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; A recent study has suggested that virus removal increases significantly over time, reaching 99.99% after approximately 150 days.&lt;ref name="Virus Removal"&gt;Bradley, I., Straub, A., Maraccini, P., Markazi, Nguyen, T., (2011).  Iron Oxide Amended Biosand Filters for Virus Removal.  Water Research&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protozoa===
In one lab test the biosand filter removed more than 99.9% of [[protozoa]].  In tests for one type of protozoa, ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'', the filter removed 100% over 29 days of use. It removed 99.98% of the oocysts of another protozoa, ''Cryptosporidium sp.'', possibly due to their smaller size.  This removal was comparable with that of the slow sand filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sswm.info/category/implementation-tools/water-purification/hardware/point-use-water-treatment/bio-sand-filtrat|title=Biosand Filter }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health benefits ==

Studies in the Dominican Republic and Cambodia conducted by the [[University of North Carolina]] and the University of Nevada show that BSF use the reduced occurrence of diarrheal diseases by 47% in all age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stauber|first=Christine|author2=Gloria M. Ortiz |author3=Dana P. Loomis |author4=Mark D. Sobsey |title=A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Concrete Biosand Filter and Its Impact on Diarrheal Disease in Bonai, Dominican Republic|journal=The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2009|volume=80|issue=2|pages=286â293}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by CAWST in Haiti, 95% of 187 households believed their water quality had improved since using biosand filters to clean it. 80% of users stated that their familiesâ health had improved since implementation. Such health perceptions on the use of biosand filter has shown to be more positive in long-term users.&lt;ref name="Stauber"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sobsey|first=Mark|author2=Christine Stauber |author3=Lisa Casanova |author4=Joseph Brown |author5=Mark Elliott |title=Point of Use Household Drinking Water Filtration: A Practical, Effective Solution for Providing Sustained Access to Safe Drinking Water in the Developing World|journal=Environmental Science and Technology|year=2008|doi=10.1021/es8026133 |volume=43 |pages=970â971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of biosand filters==

===Concrete===

[[Concrete]] filters, of concrete, are the most widespread type of biosand filter.  Concrete is generally preferable to other materials because of the low cost, wide availability and the ability to be constructed on-site. The plans for the concrete filter are distributed openly by CAWST. Several versions have been developed. The CAWST Version 9 biosand filter is constructed with a higher maximum loading rate. Although the filtered water passes EPA water quality standards, it is not optimal.&lt;ref name="CAWSTManual2010"&gt;{{cite journal|title=CAWST Biosand Filter Manual 2010|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/resources/pubs/file/43-pi-for-bsf-manual-complete-english}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research establishes that contact time between the water and the granular material is the leading determinant in purifying water. The CAWST Version 10 biosand filter takes this into account; the volume of the water reservoir is equal to the pore space volume of the sand layer. The maximum loading rate was decreased by 33% to ensure stagnant water is in constant contact with granular material.&lt;ref name="CAWSTManual2010"/&gt;

Concrete BioSand filters are typically manufactured using steel molds. The plans for a steel mold are openly distributed by CAWST.

Clean Water for Haiti, a non-profit organization based in Camp Marie, Haiti manufactures the biosand filters using an adaptation of the steel mold.  &lt;ref&gt;http://cleanwaterforhaiti.org/programs/how-does-the-filter-work/&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-profit organization OHorizons has designed a Wood Mold, based on CAWSTâs Version 10 filter, which can function as low-cost alternative. The plans for a Wood Mold are openly available on the OHorizons website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohorizons.org/resources/ OHorizons Wood Mold Construction Manual and Appendix]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plastic===

Plastic filters are constructed from plastic barrels, usually formed offsite. Hydraid biosand filters are constructed from medical grade plastic with [[ultraviolet]] resistance.&lt;ref name="HydraidBSFTech"/&gt; TivaWater is the newest version of the plastic biosand filter and has several important improvements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tivawater.com tivawater.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stainless steel===

A stainless steel biosand filter developed by engineers at [[S M Sehgal Foundation]], an NGO based in Gurugram (formerly Gurgaon), India, has been found to perform better than its concrete counterparts and with a wider opportunity for application and adoption in different geographical conditions. The high cost of plastic prevents its use in rural India. The stainless steel filter, called JalKalp, offers increased filtration rate and better portability (than concrete models) and better production quality control. Concrete filters are prone to breakage and can be difficult to transport due to weight (65&amp;nbsp;kg), make it unsuitable especially in remote rural or hilly locations. Common quality issues are variations in construction material and manufacturing flaws. Further, the efflorescence due to salts in water reduces the life of the concrete filter. The newly developed lightweight (4.5&amp;nbsp;kg) stainless steel biosand filter has an edge over concrete filters, overcoming each of those shortcomings and providing better quality control. Besides improving its appearance, stainless steel adds to the strength, reliability, durability, and portability of the filter. Water quality tests demonstrate JalKalp's effectiveness against E coli, total coliforms, turbidity, and iron contamination. This filter integrates the germicidal properties of copper with the conventional filtration. Introduction of copper foil in the drainage zone of JalKalp filter has increased the removal of total coliform and E coli to 100% from contaminated water. S M Sehgal Foundation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smsfoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt; promotes the model, which required no electricity, across India through partnerships with like-minded organizations to benefit as many rural families as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Lalit Mohan Sharma and Saurabh Sood, "Reinventing the Biosand Filter: An Easy Solution for Safe Drinking Water," ''IOSR Journals'', International Organization of Scientific Research, Vol 10. Issue 1, pp43-48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Reinventing-the-biosand-filter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.indiawaterportal.org/articles/jalkalp-water-sands-impurities /|title=JalKalp: Water sands impurities|last=Bhaduri|first=Amita|publisher= âIndia Water Portalâ 13, November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are challenges to creating biosand water filters in developing countries.  Many lack the professional capability of constructing the metal forms to pour the concrete into. Finding proper mesh sizes to sift the sand layers may also be absent.  In Nicaragua you may find metal workers capable of welding rebar for home construction, however, you will not find sheet metal bending equipment to create the metal molds.  Sand is not sold in hardware stores like in the United States. It is most likely purchased by the pickup load from streambeds or pits and the only mesh available is 1/4 inch which is too large. When traveling to a third world country it might be best to take with you the proper mesh screens.

Another problem facing the use of the filters is adoption. Many projects may provide assistance in building the water filters and some may even distribute them but getting the host country nationals to use the filters requires much more dedication.  People need to be connected to water filter owners to insist they use the devices and get them into the habit of using them.  Otherwise several of the filters are abandoned and left unattended in the roads. Simply handing the filters out is insufficient for adoption.

{{Buddhism}}
'''Buddhist art''' is the [[art|artistic practices]] that are influenced by [[Buddhism]]. It includes art media which depict [[Buddha]]s, [[bodhisattva]]s, and other entities; notable Buddhist figures, both historical and mythical; narrative scenes from the lives of all of these; [[mandala]]s and other graphic aids to practice; as well as physical objects associated with Buddhist practice, such as [[vajra]]s, bells, [[stupa]]s and [[Buddhist architecture|Buddhist temple architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Buddhist Art? |url=http://buddhistartnews.wordpress.com/what-is-buddhist-art/ |publisher=Buddhist Art News |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist art originated on the [[Indian subcontinent]] following the historical life of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]], 6th to 5th century BCE, and thereafter evolved by contact with other cultures as it spread throughout Asia and the world.

Buddhist art followed believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through [[Central Asia]] and into [[Eastern Asia]] to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as [[Southeast Asia]] to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and co-developed with [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Jainism|Jain]] art, with cave temple complexes built together, each likely influencing the other.&lt;ref name=blurton113&gt;T. Richard Blurton (1994), Hindu Art, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674391895}}, pages 113-116, 160-162, 191-192&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-iconic phase (5th century â 1st century BCE)==
{{See also|Aniconism in Buddhism}}
[[File:Buddha-Footprint.jpeg|thumb|upright|right|Footprint of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. 1st century BCE, [[Gandhara]].]]
During the 2nd to 1st century BCE, sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddhaâs life and teachings. These took the form of votive tablets or [[frieze]]s, usually in relation to the decoration of stupas.
Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form, but only through [[Buddhist symbolism]]. This period may have been [[aniconism in Buddhism|aniconic]].

Artists were reluctant to depict the Buddha anthropomorphically, and developed sophisticated aniconic symbols to avoid doing so (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear). This tendency remained as late as the 2nd century CE in the southern parts of India, in the art of the [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district#Amaravati School|Amaravati School]] (see: [[Mara (demon)|Mara's assault on the Buddha]]).
It has been argued that earlier anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha may have been made of wood and may have perished since then. However, no related archaeological evidence has been found.

The earliest works of Buddhist art in India date back to the 1st century BCE The
[[Mahabodhi Temple]] at Bodh Gaya became a model for similar structures in Burma
and Indonesia. The frescoes at [[Sigiriya]] are said to be even older than the
[[Ajanta Caves]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontline.in/archives.htm Buddhist Art ]  Frontline Magazine 13â26 May 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconic phase (1st century CE â present)==
{{see also|Greco-Buddhist art|Mathura art}}
[[File:Bodhisattva Padmapani, cave 1, Ajanta, India.jpg|thumb|left|Over life-size figure of the [[bodhisattva]] [[Padmapani]], cave 1, [[Ajanta Caves]], 5th century]]
Anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha started to emerge from the 1st century CE in [[Northern India]]. The two main centers of creation have been identified as [[Gandhara]] in todayâs [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North West Frontier Province]], in [[Pakistan]], and the region of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], in central northern India.

Hellenistic culture was introduced in Gandhara during the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] in 332&amp;nbsp;BCE. [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (reign: 321â298 BCE), founder of the [[Mauryan Empire]], conquered the Macedonian satraps during the [[Seleucid-Mauryan War]] of 305â303 BCE. Chandragupta's grandson [[Ashoka]] (reign: 268-232 BCE), who formed the largest Empire in the Indian subcontinent, converted to Buddhism following the [[Kalinga War]]. Abandoning an expansionist ideology, Ashoka worked to spread the religion and philosophy throughout his empire as described in the [[edicts of Ashoka]]. Ashoka claims to have converted the Greek populations within his realm to Buddhism:
{{quote|Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edict Nb13]]'' (S. Dhammika)&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

After the overthrow of the Mauryan Empire by the [[Shunga Empire]], the  [[Greco-Bactrian]] and subsequently the [[Indo-Greek]] Kingdoms invaded north-western India. They facilitated the spread of Greco-Buddhist art style to other parts of the subcontinent. The Indo-Greek King [[Menander I]] was renown as a great patron of Buddhism, attaining the title of an [[arhat]].&lt;ref&gt;"(In the Milindapanha) Menander is declared an arhat", McEvilley, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile [[Pushyamitra Shunga]] persecuted Buddhism, presumably to further erase the legacy of the Mauryan Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Caleb; Sarao, K. T. S. (2010). "Pushyamitra Sunga, a Hindu ruler in the second century BCE, was a great persecutor of Buddhists". In Danver, Steven L. Popular Controversies in World History. ABC-CLIO. p. 89. {{ISBN|9781598840780}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the decline of Buddhist art east of Mathura.

Gandharan Buddhist sculpture displays [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art|Hellenistic artistic influence]] in the forms of human figures and ornament. Figures were much larger than any known from India previously, and also more naturalistic, and new details included wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, and [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaf ornament.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
[[File:Inscribed Seated Buddha Image in Abhaya Mudra - Kushan Period - Katra Keshav Dev - ACCN A-1 - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-24 5972.JPG|thumb|Mathura school Buddha, [[Kushan Empire|Kushan period]]]]

The art of Mathura tends to be based on an Indian tradition, exemplified by the anthropomorphic representation of divinities such as the [[Yaksha|Yaksas]], although in a style rather archaic compared to the later representations of the Buddha. The Mathuran school contributed clothes covering the left shoulder of thin [[muslin]], the wheel on the palm, the lotus seat.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Mathura and Gandhara also influenced each other. During their artistic florescence, the two regions were even united politically under the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], both being capitals of the empire. It is still a matter of debate whether the anthropomorphic representations of Buddha was essentially a result of a local evolution of Buddhist art at Mathura, or a consequence of Greek cultural influence in Gandhara through the [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist]] [[syncretism]].

This iconic art was characterized from the start by a realistic idealism, combining realistic human features, proportions, attitudes and attributes, together with a sense of perfection and serenity reaching to the divine. This expression of the Buddha as both man and God became the iconographic canon for subsequent Buddhist art.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Remains of early Buddhist painting in India are vanishingly rare, with the later phases of the [[Ajanta Caves]] giving the great majority of surviving work, created over a relatively short up to about 480 CE.  These are highly sophisticated works, evidently produced in a well-developed tradition, probably painting secular work in palaces as much as religious subjects.

Buddhist art continued to develop in India for a few more centuries. The pink [[sandstone]] sculptures of Mathura evolved during the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] period (4th to 6th century CE) to reach a very high fineness of execution and delicacy in the modeling. The art of the Gupta school was extremely influential almost everywhere in the rest of Asia. At the end of the 12th century CE, Buddhism in its full glory came to be preserved only in the Himalayan regions in India. These areas, helped by their location, were in greater contact with Tibet and China - for example the art and traditions of [[Ladakh]] bear the stamp of Tibetan and Chinese influence.
[[File:Buddhist Expansion.svg|thumb|right|240px|Buddhist expansion throughout Asia.]]
As Buddhism expanded outside of India from the 1st century CE, its original artistic package blended with other artistic influences, leading to a progressive differentiation among the countries adopting the faith.
* A '''Northern route''' was established from the 1st century CE through [[Central Asia]], [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]], in which [[Mahayana]] Buddhism prevailed.
* A '''Southern route''', where [[Theravada]] Buddhism dominated, went through [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Laos]].

==Northern Buddhist art==
[[File:Wood Bodhisattva.jpg|left|thumb|A Chinese wooden [[Bodhisattva]] from the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279 CE)]]

The [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism]] to Central Asia, China and ultimately Korea and Japan started in the 1st century CE with a semi-legendary account of an embassy sent to the West by the Chinese Emperor [[Emperor Ming of Han China|Ming]] (58-75&amp;nbsp;AD). However, extensive contacts started in the 2nd century CE, probably as a consequence of the expansion of the [[Kushan Empire]] into the Chinese territory of the [[Tarim Basin]], with the missionary efforts of a great number of Central Asian Buddhist monks to Chinese lands. The first missionaries and translators of Buddhists scriptures into [[Chinese language|Chinese]], such as [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]], were either [[Parthia]]n, [[Kushan]], [[Sogdiana|Sogdian]] or [[Kuchean]].

Central Asian missionary efforts along the [[Silk Road]] were accompanied by a flux of artistic influences, visible in the development of [[Serindian art]] from the 2nd through the 11th century in the Tarim Basin, modern [[Xinjiang]]. Serindian art often derives from the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of the [[Gandhara]] district of what is now [[Pakistan]], combining Indian, Greek and [[Roman art|Roman]] influences. Silk Road Greco-Buddhist artistic influences can be found as far as Japan to this day, in architectural motifs, Buddhist imagery, and a select few representations of [[Kami|Japanese gods]].

The art of the northern route was also highly influenced by the development of [[Mahayana|MahÄyÄna]] Buddhism, an inclusive branch of Buddhism characterized by the adoption of new texts, in addition to the traditional [[Ägama (Buddhism)|Ägamas]], and a shift in the understanding of Buddhism. MahÄyÄna goes beyond the traditional [[Early Buddhist schools|Early Buddhist]] ideal of the release from suffering ([[dukkha|duá¸¥kha]]) of [[arhat]]s, and emphasizes the [[bodhisattva]] path. The MahÄyÄna sutras elevate the Buddha to a transcendent and infinite being, and feature a pantheon of bodhisattvas devoting themselves to the [[Paramita|Six Perfections]], ultimate knowledge ([[Prajnaparamita|PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ]]), enlightenment, and the liberation of all sentient beings. Northern Buddhist art thus tends to be characterized by a very rich and syncretic Buddhist pantheon, with a multitude of images of the various [[Buddhahood|buddhas]], bodhisattvas, and heavenly beings ([[deva (Buddhism)|devas]]).

===Afghanistan===
[[File:GBA1(trimmed).jpg|thumb|upright|Statue from a Buddhist monastery, 700&amp;nbsp;AD, Afghanistan]]
Buddhist art in [[Afghanistan]] (old [[Bactria]]) persisted for several centuries until the spread of Islam in the 7th century. It is exemplified by the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]]. Other sculptures, in [[stucco]], [[schist]] or [[clay]], display very strong blending of Indian post-[[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] mannerism and Classical influence, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] or possibly even [[Greco-Roman]].

Although Islamic rule was somewhat tolerant of other religions "[[People of the Book|of the Book]]", it showed little tolerance for Buddhism, which was perceived as a religion depending on "[[idolatry]]". Human figurative art forms also being prohibited under Islam, Buddhist art suffered numerous attacks, which culminated with the systematic destructions by the [[Taliban]] regime. The Buddhas of Bamyan, the sculptures of [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], and many of the remaining artifacts at the Afghanistan museum have been destroyed.

The multiple conflicts since the 1980s also have led to a systematic pillage of archaeological sites apparently in the hope of reselling in the international market what artifacts could be found.

===Central Asia===
{{See also|Dunhuang|Mogao Caves|Kingdom of Khotan|Silk Road|Silk Road transmission of Buddhism}}
[[File:SerindianGroup.jpg|thumb|left|[[Serindian art]], 6th-7th century [[Terra cotta|terracotta]], Tumshuq (Xinjiang).]]
[[Central Asia]] long played the role of a meeting place between China, India and [[Iran|Persia]]. During the 2nd century BCE, the expansion of the [[Han Dynasty|Former Han]] to the West led to increased contact with the Hellenistic civilizations of Asia, especially the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]].

Thereafter, the expansion of Buddhism to the North led to the formation of Buddhist communities and even Buddhist kingdoms in the oasis of Central Asia. Some [[Silk Road]] cities consisted almost entirely of Buddhist stupas and monasteries, and it seems that one of their main objectives was to welcome and service travelers between East and West.

The eastern part of Central Asia  ([[Chinese Turkestan]] ([[Tarim Basin]], [[Xinjiang]]) in particular has revealed an extremely rich [[Serindian art]] ([[cave painting|wall paintings]] and [[relief]]s in numerous caves, portable paintings on canvas, sculpture, ritual objects), displaying multiple influences from Indian and Hellenistic cultures. Works of art reminiscent of the Gandharan style, as well as scriptures in the Gandhari script [[Kharoshti]] have been found. These influences were rapidly absorbed however by the vigorous Chinese culture, and a strongly Chinese particularism develops from that point.

===China===
{{see also|Chinese Buddhist sculpture}}
Buddhism arrived in [[China]] around the 1st century CE, and introduced new types of art into China, particularly in the area of [[statue|statuary]]. Receiving this distant religion, strong Chinese traits were incorporated into Buddhist art.

====Northern Dynasties====
In the 5th to 6th centuries, the [[Northern Dynasties]] developed rather symbolic and abstract modes of representation, with schematic lines. Their style is also said to be solemn and majestic. The lack of corporeality of this art, and its distance from the original Buddhist objective of expressing the pure ideal of enlightenment in an accessible and realistic manner, progressively led to a change towards more naturalism and realism, leading to the expression of Tang Buddhist art.

Sites preserving Northern Wei Dynasty Buddhist sculpture:
*[[Yungang Grottoes]], [[Shanxi]]
*[[Longmen Grottoes]], [[Henan]]
*[[Bingling Temple]], [[Gansu]]

====Tang Dynasty====
[[File:TejaprabhÄ Buddha and the Five Planets by Chang Huai-hsing.jpg|thumb|right|''{{ill|TejaprabhÄ Buddha and the Five Planets|yue|ç¾çåä½ä¸¦äºæå}}'', 897 A.D.]]
Following a transition under the [[Sui Dynasty]], Buddhist sculpture of the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] evolved towards a markedly lifelike expression. Because of the dynasty's openness to foreign influences, and renewed exchanges with Indian culture due to the numerous travels of Chinese Buddhist monks to India, Tang dynasty Buddhist sculpture assumed a rather classical form, inspired by the Indian art of the Gupta period. During that time, the Tang capital of [[Chang'an]] (today's [[Xi'an]]) became an important center for Buddhism. From there Buddhism spread to [[Korea]], and [[Japanese missions to Tang China]] helped it gain a foothold in Japan.

However, foreign influences came to be negatively perceived in China towards the end of the Tang dynasty. In the year 845, the Tang emperor [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang China|Wuzong]] outlawed all "foreign" religions (including Christian [[Nestorianism]], [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Buddhism]]) in order to support the indigenous religion, [[Taoism]]. He confiscated Buddhist possessions, and forced the faith to go underground, therefore affecting the development of the religion and its arts in China.

[[ChÃ¡n]] Buddhism however, as the origin of Japanese [[Zen]], continued to prosper for some centuries, especially under the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279), when Chan monasteries were great centers of culture and learning.

[[File:Chinesischer Maler von 1238 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of the Chinese [[Zen]] Buddhist [[Wuzhun Shifan]], painted in 1238&amp;nbsp;AD, [[Song Dynasty]].]]

Early paintings by ChÃ¡n monks tended to eschew the meticulous realism of [[Gongbi]] painting in favour of vigorous, monochrome paintings, attempting to express the impact of enlightenment through their brushwork.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell, A; ''The imperial capitals of China: an inside view of the celestial empire'', Random House 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84595-010-1}} p179&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of [[Neo-Confucianism]] under [[Zhu Xi]] in the twelfth century resulted in considerable criticism of the monk-painters. Connected as they were with the then-unpopular school of Chan Buddhism, their paintings were discarded and ignored. Some paintings survived after being transported to Japan by visiting Zen monks, but the school of Chan painting gradually diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, ValÃ©rie Malenfer; ''Dreaming the southern song landscape: the power of illusion in Chinese painting'', BRILL 1999, {{ISBN|978-90-04-11011-3}} p161-2&lt;/ref&gt;

====Qing Dynasty====
During the Qing Dynasty, Manchu emperors supported Buddhist practices for a range of political and personal reasons. The [[Shunzhi Emperor]] was a devotee of Chan Buddhism, while his successor, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] promoted [[Tibetan Buddhism]], claiming to be the human embodiment of the bodhisattva [[Manjusri]].&lt;ref&gt;Weidner, Marsha Smith, and Patricia Ann Berger. Latter Days of the Law : Images of Chinese Buddhism, 850-1850. Lawrence, KS: Spencer Museum of Art, University of Kansas, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was under the rule of the third Qing ruler, the [[Qianlong Emperor]], that imperial patronage of the Buddhist arts reached its height in this period. He commissioned a vast number of religious works in the Tibetan style, many of which depicted him in various sacred guises.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.113&lt;/ref&gt;

Works of art produced during this period are characterized by a unique fusion of Tibetan and Chinese artistic approaches. They combine a characteristically Tibetan attention to iconographic detail with Chinese-inspired decorative elements. Inscriptions are often written in Chinese, Manchu, Tibetan, Mongolian and Sanskrit, while paintings are frequently rendered in vibrant colors.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.114-118&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vairochana the Cosmic Buddha 720p.webm|thumb|Vairochana the Cosmic Buddha 720p]]
Additionally, the [[Qianlong Emperor]] initiated a number of large-scale construction projects; in 1744 he rededicated the [[Yonghe Temple]] as Beijing's main Tibetan Buddhist monastery, donating a number of valuable religious paintings, sculptures, textiles and inscriptions to the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.114&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Xumi Fushou Temple]], and the works housed within, is another project commissioned by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] that embodies the unique blend of Tibetan and Manchu artistic styles that characterized Buddhist art produced in China under Qianlong's reign.

After the [[Qianlong Emperor]]'s abdication in 1795, the popularity of Tibetan Buddhism at the Qing court declined. The motives behind the Qing emperors' promotion of Tibetan Buddhism have been interpreted as a calculated act of political manipulation, and a means of forging ties between Manchu, Mongolian, and Tibetan communities, though this has been challenged by recent scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Patricia Ann. Empire of Emptiness : Buddhist Art and Political Authority In Qing China. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legacy====
[[File:Gathering of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas 720p.webm|thumb|Gathering of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas 720p]]
The popularization of Buddhism in China has made the country home to one of the richest collections of Buddhist arts in the world. The [[Mogao Caves]] near [[Dunhuang]] and the [[Bingling Temple]] caves near [[Yongjing County|Yongjing]] in [[Gansu]] province, the [[Longmen Grottoes]] near [[Luoyang]] in [[Henan]] province, the [[Yungang Grottoes]] near [[Datong]] in [[Shanxi]] province, and the [[Dazu Rock Carvings]] near [[Chongqing]] municipality are among the most important and renowned Buddhist sculptural sites. The [[Leshan Giant Buddha]], carved out of a hillside in the 8th century during the [[Tang Dynasty]] and looking down on the confluence of three rivers, is still the largest stone Buddha statue in the world.

===Korea===
{{see also|Buddhism in Korea|Korean Buddhist sculpture|Korean art}}
[[Korea]]n Buddhist art generally reflects an interaction between other Buddhist influences and a strongly original Korean culture. Additionally, the art of the steppes, particularly Siberian and [[Scythia]]n influences, are evident in early Korean Buddhist art based on the excavation of artifacts and burial goods such as [[Silla]] [[Crown of Silla|royal crowns]], belt buckles, daggers, and comma-shaped [[gogok]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/Korea/koreaonline/crown.htm |title=Crown |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |work=Arts of Korea |accessdate=2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grayson (2002), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The style of this indigenous art was geometric, abstract and richly adorned with a {{clarify span|characteristic "barbarian" luxury|date=November 2012}}. Although many other influences were strong, Korean Buddhist art, "bespeaks a sobriety, taste for the right tone, a sense of abstraction but also of colours that curiously enough are in line with contemporary taste" (Pierre Cambon, ''Arts asiatiques- Guimet''').

====Three Kingdoms of Korea====

Particularly important in the transmission of sophisticated art styles to the Korean kingdoms was the art of the "barbarian" Tuoba, a clan of non-Han Chinese Xianbei people who established the [[Northern Wei]] Dynasty in China in 386. The Northern Wei style was particularly influential in the art of the Goguryeo and Baekje. Baekje artisans later transmitted this style along with Southern Dynasty elements and distinct Korean elements to Japan. Korean artisans were highly selective of the styles they incorporated and combined different regional styles together to create a specific Korean Buddhist art style.&lt;ref&gt;Grayson (2002), pp. 27 &amp; 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kobs/hd_kobs.htm |title=Korean Buddhist Sculpture, 5th&amp;ndash;9th Century |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |work=Timeline of Arts History |accessdate=2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Goguryeo Buddhist art exhibited vitality and mobility akin with Northern Wei prototypes, the Baekje Kingdom was also in close contact with the [[Southern Dynasties]] of China and this close diplomatic contact is exemplified in the gentle and proportional sculpture of the Baekje, epitomized by Baekje sculpture exhibiting the fathomless smile known to art historians as the [[Baekje smile]].&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kobs/hd_kobs.htm |title=Korean Buddhist Sculpture (5thâ9th century) &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=metmuseum.org |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silla Kingdom also developed a distinctive Buddhist art tradition epitomized by the [[Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation (National Treasure No. 83)|Bangasayusang]], a half-seated contemplative maitreya whose Korean-made twin, the Miroku Bosatsu, was sent to Japan as a proselytizing gift and now resides in the Koryu-ji Temple in Japan.&lt;ref name="kenyon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln275/Jap-Kor-art.htm |title=Japanese Art and Its Korean Secret |publisher=www2.kenyon.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism in the Three Kingdoms period stimulated massive temple-building projects, such as the [[Mireuksa]] Temple in the Baekje Kingdom and the [[Hwangnyongsa]] Temple in Silla.

Particularly, the semi-seated Maitreya form was adapted into a highly developed Korean style which was transmitted to Japan as evidenced by the Koryu-ji Miroku Bosatsu and the Chugu-ji Siddhartha statues.

====Unified Silla====
[[File:Goryeo Pagoda.jpg|thumb|160px|The Goryeo era [[Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda]] sits on the first floor of the [[National Museum of Korea]].]]
During the [[Unified Silla]] period, [[East Asia]] was particularly stable with China and Korea both enjoying unified governments. Early Unified Silla art combined Silla styles and Baekje styles. Korean Buddhist art was also influenced by new [[Tang Dynasty]] styles as evidenced by a new popular Buddhist motif with full-faced Buddha sculptures. Tang China was the cross roads of East, Central, and South Asia and so the Buddhist art of this time period exhibit the so-called international style. State-sponsored Buddhist art flourished during this period, the epitome of which is the [[Seokguram]] Grotto.

====Goryeo Dynasty====
The fall of the Unified Silla Dynasty and the establishment of the [[Goryeo]] Dynasty in 918 indicates a new period of Korean Buddhist art. The Goryeo kings also lavishly sponsored Buddhism and Buddhist art flourished, especially Buddhist paintings and illuminated sutras written in gold and silver ink. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/07/eak/ht07eak.htm]. The crowning achievement of this period is the carving of approximately 80,000 woodblocks of the [[Tripitaka Koreana]] which was done twice.

====Joseon Dynasty====
The [[Joseon Dynasty]] actively suppressed Buddhism beginning in 1406 and Buddhist temples and art production subsequently decline in quality in quantity although beginning in 1549, Buddhist art does continue to be produced.

[[File:ASURA detail Kohfukuji.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The ASURA in [[KÅfuku-ji]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] (734)]]
Before the introduction of Buddhism, [[Japan]] had already been the seat of various cultural (and artistic) influences, from the abstract linear decorative art of the indigenous Neolithic [[JÅmon]] from around 10500&amp;nbsp;BC to 300&amp;nbsp;BC, to the art during the [[Yayoi]] and [[Kofun]] periods, with developments such as [[Haniwa]] art.

The cultural exchange between India and Japan was not direct, as Japan received Buddhism through Korea, China, Central Asia and eventually India. The Japanese discovered Buddhism in the 6th century when missionary monks travelled to the islands together with numerous scriptures and works of art. The cultural contact between Indian Dharmic civilization and Japan through the adoption of Buddhist ideas and aesthetic has contributed to the development of a national cultural order in the subsequent century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Indian Influence on the Art of Japan | author = Sampa Biswas | publisher = Northern Book Centre | year = 2010 | isbn = 9788172112691 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=fLjcMfMGP10C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhist+art+of+Japan&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisg5jQrPrVAhWKMo8KHXxoBpEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Buddhist%20art%20of%20Japan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist religion was adopted by the state in the following century. Being geographically at the end of the [[Silk Road]], Japan was able to preserve many aspects of Buddhism at the very time it was disappearing in India, and being suppressed in Central Asia and China.

From 711, numerous temples and monasteries were built in the capital city of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], including a five-story [[pagoda]], the Golden Hall of the Horyuji, and the [[KÅfuku-ji]] temple. Countless paintings and sculptures were made, often under governmental sponsorship. Indian, Hellenistic, Chinese and Korean artistic influences blended into an original style characterized by realism and gracefulness. The creation of Japanese Buddhist art was especially rich between the 8th and 13th centuries during the periods of [[Nara period|Nara]], [[Heian period|Heian]] and [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]].
Japan developed an extremely rich figurative art for the pantheon of Buddhist deities, sometimes combined with [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Shinto]] influences. This art can be very varied, creative and bold.

From the 12th and 13th, a further development was [[Zen]] art, and it faces golden days in [[Muromachi Period]], following the introduction of the faith by [[Dogen]] and [[Eisai]] upon their return from China. Zen art is mainly characterized by original paintings (such as [[sumi-e]]) and poetry (especially [[haiku]]s), striving to express the true essence of the world through impressionistic and unadorned "non-dualistic" representations. The search for enlightenment "in the moment" also led to the development of other important derivative arts such as the [[Chanoyu]] tea ceremony or the [[Ikebana]] art of flower arrangement. This evolution went as far as considering almost any human activity as an art with a strong spiritual and aesthetic content, first and foremost in those activities related to combat techniques ([[martial art]]s).

Buddhism remains very active in Japan to this day. Still around 80,000 Buddhist temples are preserved. Many of them are in wood and are regularly restored.

===Tibet and Bhutan===
{{See also|Bhutanese art|Tibetan art}}
[[File:Yama tibet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Yama]] 18th century, Tibet]]
[[Tantric Buddhism]] started as a movement in eastern India around the 5th or the 6th century. Many of the practices of Tantric Buddhism are derived from [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] (the usage of [[mantra]]s, [[yoga]], or the burning of sacrificial offerings). Tantrism became the dominant form of Buddhism in [[Tibet]] from the 8th century. Due to its geographical centrality in Asia, Tibetan Buddhist art received influence from Indian, [[Nepal]]i, Greco-Buddhist and Chinese art.

One of the most characteristic creations of Tibetan Buddhist art are the [[mandala]]s, diagrams of a "divine temple" made of a circle enclosing a square, the purpose of which is to help Buddhist devotees focus their attention through meditation and follow the path to the central image of the Buddha.
Artistically, Buddhist [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] art and Hindu art tend to be the two strongest inspirations of Tibetan art.

In 10th to 11th centuries, [[Tabo Monastery]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]], Northern India (at that time part of Western Tibet Kingdom) serves an important role as an intermediary between India and Tibet cultural exchange, especially Buddhist art and philosophy. Notable example of Tibetan Buddhist art in Tabo is its exquisite frescoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Tabo: a lamp for the kingdom : early Indo Tibetan Buddhist art in the western Himalaya, Archeologia, arte primitiva e orientale | author1 =Deborah E.

===Vietnam===
[[File:National Museum Vietnamese History 35 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|The boy Buddha rising up from lotus. Crimson and gilded wood, Tráº§n-Há» dynasty, Vietnam, 14th-15th century]]
Chinese influence was predominant in the north of [[Vietnam]] (Tonkin) between the 1st and 9th centuries, and [[Confucianism]] and Mahayana Buddhism were prevalent. Overall, the art of Vietnam has been strongly influenced by Chinese Buddhist art.

In the south thrived the former kingdom of [[Champa]] (before it was later overtaken by the Vietnamese from the north). [[Champa]] had a strongly Indianized art, just as neighboring [[Cambodia]]. Many of its statues were characterized by rich body adornments. The capital of the kingdom of Champa was annexed by Vietnam in 1471, and it totally collapsed in the 1720s, while [[Cham (Asia)|Cham people]] remain an abundant minority across [[Southeast Asia]].

==Southern Buddhist art==
The orthodox forms of Buddhism, also known as Southern Buddhism are still practised in Sri Lanka, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. During the 1st century CE, the trade on the overland Silk Road tended to be restricted by the rise of the [[Parthia]]n empire in the [[Middle East]], an unvanquished enemy of [[Roman Empire|Rome]], just as Romans were becoming extremely wealthy and their demand for Asian luxury was rising. This demand revived the sea connections between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and China, with India as the intermediary of choice. From that time, through trade connections, commercial settlements, and even political interventions, India started to strongly influence [[Southeast Asia]]n countries. Trade routes linked India with southern [[Burma]], central and southern [[Thailand|Siam]], lower [[Cambodia]] and southern [[Vietnam]], and numerous urbanized coastal settlements were established there.

[[File:CambodianBuddha.JPG|thumb|upright|A Cambodian Buddha, 14th century]]
For more than a thousand years, Indian influence was therefore the major factor that brought a certain level of cultural unity to the various countries of the region. The [[PÄli|Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]] languages and the Indian script, together with [[Mahayana]] and [[Theravada]] Buddhism, [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] and [[Hinduism]], were transmitted from direct contact and through sacred texts and Indian literature such as the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]. This expansion provided the artistic context for the development of Buddhist art in these countries, which then developed characteristics of their own.

Between the 1st and 8th centuries, several kingdoms competed for influence in the region (particularly the Cambodian [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] then the Burmese [[Mon (ethnic group)|Mon]] kingdoms) contributing various artistic characteristics, mainly derived from the Indian [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] style. Combined with a pervading Hindu influence, Buddhist images, votive tablets and Sanskrit inscriptions are found throughout the area. Between 8th- and 12th-century, under the patronage of [[Pala Empire|Pala dynasty]], arts and ideas of Buddhism and Hinduism co-developed and became increasingly intermeshed.&lt;ref name=richardblurton202/&gt; However, with Muslim invasion and sacking of monasteries in India, states Richard Blurton,  "Buddhism collapsed as a major force in India".&lt;ref name=richardblurton202&gt;T. Richard Blurton (1994), Hindu Art, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674391895}}, pages 202-204, Quote: "Buddhism flourished in this part of India throughout the first millennium AD, especially under the patronage of Pala kings of the eighth and twelfth centuries. Towards the end of this period, popular Buddhism and Hinduism became increasingly intermeshed. However, when Muslim invaders from further west sacked the monasteries in the twelfth century, Buddhism collapsed as a major force in India."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buddha Mendut.jpg|thumb|left|The statue of Dhyani Buddha [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]] inside the [[Mendut]] temple.]]

By the 8th to 9th century, [[Sailendra]]n Buddhist art were developed and flourished in [[Medang Kingdom|Medang Mataram]] kingdom of [[Central Java]], Indonesia. This period marked the renaissance of Buddhist art in Java, as numerous exquisite monuments were built, including [[Kalasan]], [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]], [[Mendut]] and [[Borobudur]] stone mandala. The traditions would continue to the 13th century [[Singhasari]] Buddhist art of East Java.

From the 9th to the 13th centuries, Southeast Asia had very powerful empires and became extremely active in Buddhist architectural and artistic creation. The [[Sri Vijaya]] Empire to the south and the [[Khmer Empire]] to the north competed for influence, but both were adherents of Mahayana Buddhism, and their art expressed the rich Mahayana pantheon of the [[Bodhisattva]]s.
The [[Theravada]] Buddhism of the Pali canon was introduced to the region around the 13th century from [[Sri Lanka]], and was adopted by the newly founded [[Thai ethnic groups|ethnic Thai]] kingdom of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]]. Since in Theravada Buddhism of the period, Monasteries typically were the central places for the laity of the towns to receive instruction and have disputes arbitrated by the monks, the construction of temple complexes plays a particularly important role in the artistic expression of Southeast Asia from that time.

From the 14th century, the main factor was the spread of [[Islam]] to the maritime areas of Southeast Asia, overrunning [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and most of the islands as far as the [[Southern Philippines]]. In the continental areas, Theravada Buddhism continued to expand into Burma, [[Laos]] and Cambodia.

===Sri Lanka===
[[File:Sri lanka aukana buddha statue.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Buddha statue in Sri Lanka.]]
According to tradition, Buddhism was introduced in Sri Lanka in the 3rd century BCE by Indian missionaries under the guidance of Thera [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Mahinda]], the son of the Mauryan Emperor [[Ashoka]]. Prior to the expansion of Buddhism, the indigenous population of Sri Lanka lived in an animistic world full of superstition. The assimilation and conversion of the various pre-Buddhist beliefs was a slow process. In order to gain a foothold among the rural population, Buddhism needed to assimilate the various categories of spirits and other supernatural beliefs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The earliest monastic complex was the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya|MahÄvihÄra]] at [[Anuradhapura|AnurÄdhapura]] founded by [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura|DevÄnampiyatissa]] and presented to Mahinda Thera. The MahÄvihÄra became the centre of the orthodox TheravÄda doctrine and its supreme position remained unchallenged until the foundation of the [[Abhayagiri VihÄra]] around BC 89 by [[Valagamba of Anuradhapura|VaÅ£Å£agÄmaÅÄ©]].

The Abhayagiri VihÄra became the seat of the reformed MahÄyÄna doctrines. The rivalry between the monks of the MahÄvihÄra and the Abhayagiri led to a further split and the foundation of the [[Jetavanaramaya|Jetavanarama]] near the MahÄvihÄra. The main feature of Sinhala Buddhism was its division into three major groups, or ''nikÄyas'', named after the three main monastic complexes at AnurÄdhapura; the MahÄvihÄra, the Abhayagiri, and the JetavanÄrÄma. This was the result in the deviations in the disciplinary rules ''(vinaya)'' and doctrinal disputes. All the other monasteries of Sri Lanka owed ecclesiastical allegiance to one of the three. Sri Lanka is famous for its creations of Buddhist sculptures made of stone and cast in bronze alloy.&lt;ref&gt;von Schroeder, Ulrich. 1990. ''Buddhist Sculptures of Sri Lanka''.

===Myanmar===
[[File:Buddha 00004.JPG|thumb|upright|A Mandalay-style statue of Buddha]]
A neighbor of India, [[Myanmar]] (Burma) was naturally strongly influenced by the eastern part of Indian territory. The [[Mon people|Mon]] of southern Burma are said to have been converted to Buddhism around 200&amp;nbsp;BC under the proselytizing of the Indian king [[Ashoka]], before the schism between [[Mahayana]] and [[Hinayana]] Buddhism.

Early Buddhist temples are found, such as Beikthano in central Myanmar, with dates between the 1st and the 5th centuries. The Buddhist art of the Mons was especially influenced by the Indian art of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] and post-Gupta periods, and their mannerist style spread widely in Southeast Asia following the expansion of the Mon Empire between the 5th and 8th centuries.

Later, thousands of Buddhist temples were built at [[Bagan]], the capital, between the 11th and 13th centuries, and around 2,000 of them are still standing. Beautiful jeweled statues of the Buddha are remaining from that period. Creation managed to continue despite the seizure of the city by the [[Mongols]] in 1287.
[[File:Bodleian MS. Burm. a. 12 Life of the Buddha 15-18.jpg|thumbnail|left|Scenes from the life of the Buddha in an 18th-century Burmese watercolour]]
During the [[Ava Kingdom|Ava period]], from the 14th to 16th centuries, the Ava (Innwa) style of the Buddha image was popular. In this style, the Buddha has large protruding ears, exaggerated eyebrows that curve upward, half-closed eyes, thin lips and a hair bun that is pointed at the top, usually depicted in the bhumisparsa [[mudra]].&lt;ref name="niu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/burmese/cooler/Chapter_4/Part1/post_pagan_period__part_1.htm |title=The Post Pagan Period - Part 1 |publisher=seasite.niu.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Konbaung dynasty]], at the end of the 18th century, the Mandalay style of the Buddha image emerged, a style that remains popular to this day.&lt;ref name="niu2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/burmese/cooler/Chapter_4/Part3/post_pagan_period__part_3.htm |title=The Post Pagan Period - Part 3 |publisher=seasite.niu.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a marked departure from the Innwa style, and the Buddha's face is much more natural, fleshy, with naturally-slanted eyebrows, slightly slanted eyes, thicker lips, and a round hair bun at the top. Buddha images in this style can be found reclining, standing or sitting.&lt;ref name="buddhaartgallery"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhaartgallery.com/mandalay_buddha_statues.html |title=buddhaartgallery.com |publisher=buddhaartgallery.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandalay-style Buddhas wear flowing, draped robes.

Another common style of Buddha images is the Shan style, from the [[Shan people]], who inhabit the highlands of Myanmar. In this style, the Buddha is depicted with angular features, a large and prominently pointed nose, a hair bun tied similar to Thai styles, and a small, thin mouth.&lt;ref name="buddhaartgallery2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhaartgallery.com/shan_buddha_statues.html |title=buddhaartgallery.com |publisher=buddhaartgallery.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cambodia===
{{See|Khmer art|Khmer sculpture}}
[[File:Bodhisattva Lokesvara statue.jpg|thumb|upright|Bodhisattva [[Avalokitesvara|Lokesvara]], [[Cambodia]] 12th century.]]
[[Cambodia]] was the center of the [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] kingdom, which expanded into Burma and as far south as Malaysia between the 3rd and 6th centuries. Its influence seems to have been essentially political, most of the cultural influence coming directly from India.

Later, from the 9th to 13th centuries, the Mahayana Buddhist and Hindu [[Khmer Empire]] dominated vast parts of the Southeast Asian peninsula, and its influence was foremost in the development of Buddhist art in the region. Under the Khmer, more than 900 temples were built in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand. The royal patronage for Khmer Buddhist art reached its new height with the patronage of [[Jayavarman VII]], a Buddhist king that built [[Angkor Thom]] walled city, adorned with the smiling face of [[Lokeshvara]] in Angkor Thom ''dvaras'' (gates) and ''prasat'' towers [[Bayon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Buddhist Monuments and Temples of Cambodia and Laos | author = W.

A great deal of Cambodian Buddhist sculpture is preserved at Angkor; however, organized looting has had a heavy impact on many sites around the country.

Often, Khmer art manages to express intense spirituality through divinely beaming expressions, in spite of spare features and slender lines.

The Thai Buddhist art encompasses period for more than a millennia, from pre Thai culture of Dvaravati and Srivijaya, to the first Thai capital of Thai 13th century Sukhothai, all the way to  succeeding Thai kingdoms of Ayutthaya and Rattanakosin.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"&gt;{{cite book | title = Thai Buddhist Art: Discover Thai Art | author = Dawn F.

From the 1st to the 7th centuries, Buddhist art in [[Thailand]] was first influenced by direct contact with Indian traders and the expansion of the [[Mon (ethnic group)|Mon]] kingdom, leading to the creation of Hindu and Buddhist art inspired from the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] tradition, with numerous monumental statues of great virtuosity.

From the 9th century, the various schools of Thai art then became strongly influenced by Cambodian [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] art in the north and [[Sri Vijaya]] art in the south, both of Mahayana faith. Up to the end of that period, Buddhist art is characterized by a clear fluidness in the expression, and the subject matter is characteristic of the [[Mahayana]] pantheon with multiple creations of [[Bodhisattva]]s.

From the 13th century, [[Theravada]] Buddhism was introduced from Sri Lanka around the same time as the [[Thai ethnic groups|ethnic Thai]] kingdom of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]] was established.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"/&gt; The new faith inspired highly stylized images in Thai Buddhism, with sometimes very geometrical and almost abstract figures.

During the [[Ayutthaya kingdom|Ayutthaya]] period (14th-18th centuries), the Buddha came to be represented in a more stylistic manner with sumptuous garments and jeweled ornamentations. Many Thai sculptures or temples tended to be [[gilding|gilded]], and on occasion enriched with inlays.

The ensuing period of [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]] and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] saw the further development of Thai Buddhist art.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"/&gt; By the 18th century, [[Bangkok]] was established as the royal center of the kingdom of [[Siam]]. Subsequently, the Thai rulers filled the city with imposing Buddhist monuments to demonstrate their Buddhist piety as well as to showcase their authority. Among others are the celebrated [[Wat Phra Kaew]] which hosts the [[Emerald Buddha]]. Other Buddhist temples in Bangkok includes [[Wat Arun]] with ''prang'' style towers, and [[Wat Pho]] with its famous image of [[Reclining Buddha]].

===Indonesia===

[[File:Borobudur-perfect-buddha.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A Buddha in [[Borobudur]].]]
Like the rest of Southeast Asia, [[Indonesia]] seems to have been most strongly influenced by India from the 1st century CE. The islands of [[Sumatra]] and [[Java (island)|Java]] in western Indonesia were the seat of the empire of [[Sri Vijaya]] (8th-13th century), which came to dominate most of the area around the Southeast Asian peninsula through maritime power. The Sri Vijayan Empire had adopted Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, under a line of rulers named the [[Sailendra]]. The Sailendras was the ardent temple builder and the devoted patron of Buddhism in Java.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"&gt;{{cite book | title = Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java | author1 = Jean Philippe Vogel | author2 = Adriaan Jacob Barnouw | publisher = Asian Educational Services | year = 1936 | isbn = 9788120612259 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=wQ2x0cbZkn0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhist+art+of+Java&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLm_6o6PfVAhXKo48KHUc_DuEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Buddhist%20art%20of%20Java&amp;f=false| pages = 90â92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sri Vijaya spread Mahayana Buddhist art during its expansion into the Southeast Asian peninsula. Numerous statues of Mahayana [[Bodhisattva]]s from this period are characterized by a very strong refinement and technical sophistication, and are found throughout the region. One of the earliest Buddhist inscription in Java, the [[Kalasan inscription]] dated 778, mentioned about the construction of a [[Kalasan|temple]] for the goddess [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]].&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"/&gt;

[[File:Prajnaparamita Java Side Detail.JPG|thumb|upright|The statue of [[Prajnaparamita of Java|PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ from Singhasari]], East Java.]]
Extremely rich and refined architectural remains are found in Java and Sumatra. The most magnificent is the temple of [[Borobudur]] (the largest Buddhist structure in the world, built  around 780-850&amp;nbsp;AD), built by Sailendras.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"/&gt; This temple is modelled after the Buddhist concept of universe, the [[Mandala]] which counts 505 images of the seated Buddha and unique bell-shaped stupa that contains the statue of Buddha. Borobudur is adorned with long series of bas-reliefs narrated the holy Buddhist scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Borobudur: Golden Tales of the Buddhas | author = John Miksic | publisher = Tuttle Publishing | year = 2012 | isbn = 9781462909100 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=jwzQAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=borobudur+golden+tales+of+the+buddhas&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP45O7r_rVAhWJtY8KHcpuAfYQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=buddhist%20art&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest Buddhist structure in Indonesia probably is the [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]] stupas at Karawang, West Java, dated from around the 4th century. This temple is some plastered brick stupas. However, Buddhist art in Indonesia reach the golden era during the [[Sailendra]] dynasty rule in Java. The bas-reliefs and statues of [[Boddhisatva]], [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]], and [[Kinnara]] found in [[Kalasan]], [[Candi Sewu|Sewu]], [[Candi Sari|Sari]], and [[Candi Plaosan|Plaosan]] temple is very graceful with serene expression, While [[Mendut]] temple near Borobudur, houses the giant statue of [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]].

In [[Sumatra]] Sri Vijaya probably built the temple of Muara Takus, and [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Muaro Jambi]]. The most beautiful example of classical Javanese Buddhist art is the serene and delicate statue of [[Prajnaparamita]] (the collection of National Museum Jakarta) the goddess of transcendental wisdom from [[Singhasari]] kingdom.&lt;ref name ="VCM"&gt;{{cite web|title = Prajnaparamita | publisher =Virtual Collections of Asian Masterpieces| url  =http://masterpieces.asemus.museum/masterpiece/detail.nhn?objectId=12147| accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indonesian Buddhist Empire of Sri Vijaya declined due to conflicts with the [[Chola]] rulers of India, then followed by [[Majapahit]] empire.

==Contemporary Buddhist art==
[[File:Buddha and the gospel of Buddhism (1916) (14779469804).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Illustration from the book "Buddha and the gospel of Buddhism" (1916).]]
Many contemporary artists have made use of Buddhist themes. Notable examples are [[Bill Viola]], in his video installations,&lt;ref&gt;Buddha Mind in Contemporary Art, University of California Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Connell]], in sculpture,&lt;ref&gt;ARTlines, April 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Allan Graham]] in his multi-media "Time is Memory".&lt;ref&gt;The Brooklyn Rail, December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK [[The Network of Buddhist Organisations]] has interested itself in identifying Buddhist practitioners across all the arts. In 2005 it co-ordinated the UK-wide Buddhist arts festival, "A Lotus in Flower";&lt;ref&gt;a poster advertising one of the events is archived here - http://www.nbo.org.uk/whats%20on/poster.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050824213345/http://www.nbo.org.uk/whats%20on/poster.pdf# |date=24 August 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009 it helped organise the two-day arts conference, "Buddha Mind, Creative Mind".&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fwbo-news.blogspot.com/2009/07/report-from-buddha-mind-creative-mind.html |title=Triratna Buddhist Community News: Report from âBuddha Mind - Creative Mind?â conference |author=Lokabandhu |publisher=fwbo-news.blogspot.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the latter an association of Buddhist artists was formed.&lt;ref name="ning"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dharmaarts.ning.com/ |title=Dharma Arts Network - Launched at Buddha Mind - Creative Mind ? |publisher=dharmaarts.ning.com |accessdate=2014-12-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010000408/http://dharmaarts.ning.com/# |archive-date=10 October 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5357">A '''calendar''' (sometimes historically spelled '''kalendar''') is, in the context of [[archival science]], [[textual scholarship]], and archival publication, a descriptive list of [[document]]s. The verb ''to calendar'' means to compile or edit such a list. The word is used differently in Britain and North America with regard to the amount of detail expected: in Britain, it implies a detailed summary which can be used as a substitute for the full text; whereas in North America it implies a more basic inventory.

The term derives from a (now somewhat archaic) word meaning a list or register of any kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|calendar, n. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the documents in a calendar are generally arranged in chronological order, the term has no direct relationship to a [[Calendar|table of dates]].

==British tradition==
In the British tradition, the word normally implies a full descriptive summary (often published) in which each document is the subject of a "carefully controlled, rigorously consistent prÃ©cis".&lt;ref name=harvey&gt;Harvey 2001, pp. 56â59.&lt;/ref&gt; All significant elements in the text are recorded, so that the great majority of researchers will be spared the need to consult the originals: the completed calendar effectively becomes a substitute for the archival documents, and is often treated as a [[primary source]] in its own right. Trivial or incidental elements ("common form and unnecessary verbiage") are omitted;&lt;ref name=harvey/&gt; but all names, dates and significant statements are noted, and passages which appear to the editor to be of particular interest or importance may be quoted in full.&lt;ref&gt;Hunnisett 1977, pp. 52â66.&lt;/ref&gt; Documents in archaic or foreign languages (particularly Latin) are normally calendared in the modern vernacular, but significant or ambiguous terms or passages may be given in the original language. A calendar is therefore less detailed or comprehensive than a series of full transcripts or translations; but considerably more detailed than an archival list or other [[finding aid]].

Calendars are at their most useful when published, giving remote users access to the contents of archival records. Well-known series of published calendars of British medieval and [[Early modern period|early modern]] sources include the ''[[Charter Roll|Calendar of Charter Rolls]]'' (1903â1927); the ''[[Close Roll|Calendar of Close Rolls]]'' (1900â1963); the ''[[Patent Rolls|Calendar of Patent Rolls]]'' (1891â); the ''Calendars of State Papers'' (Domestic and Foreign) (1856â); the ''Calendars of Treasury Books and Papers'' (1868â1962) (all from material now in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]); the ''Calendars of Entries in the Papal Registers relating to Great Britain and Ireland'' (published by the [[Public Record Office]] 1896â1960, and by the [[Irish Manuscripts Commission]] 1978â); the ''[[Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII]]'' (1864â1932); and the "Reports and Calendars" series on privately held archives published between 1869 and 2004 by the [[Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts]].

One advantage of calendars in the era of print publishing was that a prÃ©cis of a text took up less space than a full transcript or [[facsimile]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunnisett 1977, pp. 14â16.&lt;/ref&gt; This reasoning carries less weight in the age of electronic publishing; but calendars still have a role in providing readers with an accurate, comprehensive and accessible summary of a document which may be more readily comprehensible than a more faithful and complete version of the original.

Paul Harvey emphasises that the editorial task of calendaring "is not the soft option that editors have sometimes assumed"; and that the process of summarising accurately without error or distortion can be "significantly harder than straightforward editing".&lt;ref name=harvey/&gt;

==North American tradition==
In the North American tradition, a "calendar" generally implies a briefer and more summary list or inventory than in Britain, arranged chronologically. Its intention is to provide a succinct indication of the documents' date, origin and subject-matter, but little more; and it is designed as a [[finding aid]] to locate the originals, not as a substitute for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/c/calendar |title=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology |accessdate=2013-02-02 |publisher=[[Society of American Archivists]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stevens and Burg 1997, pp. 67â69.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5509">'''Categories for the Description of Works of Art''' ('''CDWA''') describes the content of art databases by articulating a conceptual framework for describing and accessing information about works of art, architecture, other material culture, groups and collections of works, and related images. The CDWA includes 532 categories and subcategories. A small subset of categories are considered core in that they represent the minimum information necessary to identify and describe a work. The CDWA includes discussions, basic guidelines for cataloging, and examples. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/standards/cdwa/introduction.html CDWA Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The Categories provide a framework to which existing art information systems can be mapped and upon which new systems can be developed. In addition, the discussions in the CDWA identify vocabulary resources and descriptive practices that will make information residing in diverse systems both more compatible and more accessible. 

The use of the CDWA framework will contribute to the integrity and longevity of data and will facilitate its inevitable migration to new systems as informational technology continues to evolve. Above all, it will help to give end-users consistent, reliable access to information, regardless of the system in which it resides. 

These guidelines hopefully provide a common ground for reaching agreement on what information should be included in art information systems, and what information will be shared or exchanged with other institutions or systems. Target users are curators, registrars, researchers, information managers, and systems vendors.

==History==
The CDWA is a product of the Art Information Task Force (AITF), which encouraged dialog between art historians, art information professionals, and information providers so that together they could develop guidelines for describing works of art, architecture, groups of objects, and visual and textual surrogates. 

Formed in the early 1990s, the task force was made up of representatives from the communities that provide and use art information: art historians, museum curators and registrars, visual resource professionals, art librarians, information managers, and technical specialists. The work of the AITF was funded by the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]], with a two-year matching grant from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) to the [[College Art Association]] (CAA).

==CDWA Lite== &lt;!-- [[Lightweight Information Describing Objects]] redirects here --&gt;
[[ARTstor]], the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]], and RLG Programs/[[OCLC]] have worked together to develop an XML schema to describe cultural materials and their surrogates to provide an easier and more sustainable model for contributing to union resources. This initiative was driven by the absence of a data content standard specifically designed for unique cultural works, and a technical format for expressing this data in a machine-readable format.

CDWA Lite is an XML schema to describe core records for works of art and material culture based on CDWA and the Cataloging Cultural Objects (CCO) content standard. CDWA Lite records are intended for contribution to union catalogs and other repositories using the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) harvesting protocol. The CDWA Lite schema has been enlarged and integrated into the [[LIDO|Lightweight Information Describing Objects (LIDO)]] schema, which is available on the CIDOC site. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Categories for the Description of Works of Art (CDWA)|url=https://www.getty.edu/research/publications/electronic_publications/cdwa/introduction.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28130">'''Cognitive musicology''' is a branch of [[cognitive science]] concerned with [[Cognitive model#Computational models|computationally modeling]] musical knowledge with the goal of understanding both music and cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Laske | first = Otto | title = Navigating New Musical Horizons (Contributions to the Study of Music and Dance) | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-313-30632-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive musicology can be differentiated from other branches of [[music psychology]] via its methodological emphasis, using computer modeling to study music-related [[knowledge representation]] with roots in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive science]]. The use of computer models provides an exacting, interactive medium in which to formulate and test theories.&lt;ref&gt;Laske, O. (1999). AI and music: A cornerstone of cognitive musicology. In M. Balaban, K. Ebcioglu, &amp; O. Laske (Eds.), ''Understanding music with AI: Perspectives on music cognition.'' Cambridge: The [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

This interdisciplinary field investigates topics such as the parallels between language and music in the brain. Biologically inspired models of computation are often included in research, such as neural networks and evolutionary programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graci | first1 = C | year = 2009 | title = A brief tour of the learning sciences featuring a cognitive tool for investigating melodic phenomena | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Technology Systems | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 181â211 | doi=10.2190/et.38.2.i}}&lt;/ref&gt; This field seeks to model how musical knowledge is represented, stored, perceived, performed, and generated. By using a well-structured computer environment, the systematic structures of these cognitive phenomena can be investigated.&lt;ref&gt;Hamman, M., 1999. "Structure as Performance: Cognitive Musicology and the Objectification of Procedure," in  Otto Laske: Navigating New Musical Horizons, ed. J. Tabor. New York: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even while enjoying the simplest of melodies there are multiple brain processes that are synchronizing to comprehend what is going on. After the stimulus enters and undergoes the processes of the ear, it enters the auditory cortex, part of the temporal lobe, which begins processing the sound by assessing its pitch and volume. From here, brain functioning differs amongst the analysis of different aspects of music. For instance, the rhythm is processed and regulated by the left frontal cortex, the left parietal cortex and the right cerebellum standardly. Tonality, the building of musical structure around a central chord, is assessed by the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum (Abram, 2015). Music is able to access many different brain functions that play an integral role in other higher brain functions such as motor control, memory, language, reading and emotion. Research has shown that music can be used as an alternative method to access these functions that may be unavailable through non-musical stimulus due to a disorder. Musicology explores the use of music and how it can provide alternative transmission routes for information processing in the brain for diseases such as Parkinson's and [[dyslexia]] as well.

==Notable researchers==
The polymath [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Christopher Longuet-Higgins]], who coined the term "cognitive science", is one of the pioneers of cognitive musicology.  Among other things, he is noted for the computational implementation of an early key-finding algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;Longuet-Higgins, C. (1987) Mental Processes: Studies in cognitive science. Cambridge, MA, US: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Key finding is an essential element of tonal music, and the key-finding problem has attracted considerable attention in the psychology of music over the past several decades.  Carol Krumhansl and Mark Schmuckler proposed an empirically grounded key-finding algorithm which bears their names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Krumhansl | first = Carol | title = Cognitive Foundations of Musical Pitch | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford Oxfordshire | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-19-505475-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their approach is based on key-profiles which were painstakingly determined by what has come to be known as the probe-tone technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krumhansl | first1 = C. | last2 = Kessler | first2 = E. | year = 1982 | title = Tracing the dynamic changes in perceived tonal organisation in a spatial representation of musical keys | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 89 | issue = | pages = 334â368 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.89.4.334}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This algorithm has successfully been able to model the perception of musical key in short excerpts of music, as well as to track listeners' changing sense of key movement throughout an entire piece of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmuckler | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Tomovski | first2 = R. | year = 2005 | title = Perceptual tests of musical key-finding | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 1124â1149 | doi=10.1037/0096-1523.31.5.1124}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Temperley, whose early work within the field of cognitive musicology applied dynamic programming to aspects of music cognition, has suggested a number of refinements to the Krumhansl-Schmuckler Key-Finding Algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Temperley | first = David | title = The Cognition of Basic Musical Structures | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-262-20134-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto Laske was a champion of cognitive musicology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Laske | first = Otto | title = Otto Laske | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-313-30632-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A collection of papers that he co-edited served to heighten the visibility of cognitive musicology and to strengthen its association with AI and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Balaban | first = Mira | title = Understanding Music with AI | publisher = AAAI Press | year = 1992 | location = Menlo Park | isbn = 0-262-52170-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foreword of this book reprints a free-wheeling interview with [[Marvin Minsky]], one of the founding fathers of AI, in which he discusses some of his early writings on music and the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Minsky | first1 = M | year = 1981 | title = Music, mind, and meaning | url = http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/MusicMindMeaning.html | journal = Computer Music Journal | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 28â44 | doi=10.2307/3679983}}&lt;/ref&gt; AI researcher turned cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter has also contributed a number of ideas pertaining to music from an AI perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hofstadter | first = Douglas | title = GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-465-02656-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Musician Steve Larson, who worked for a time in Hofstadter's lab, formulated a theory of "musical forces" derived by analogy with physical forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Larson | first1 = S | year = 2004 | title = Musical Forces and Melodic Expectations: Comparing Computer Models with Experimental Results | doi = 10.1525/mp.2004.21.4.457 | journal = Music Perception | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 457â498 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hofstadter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cope | first = David | title = Virtual Music | publisher = The MIT Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-262-53261-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also weighed in on David Cope's experiments in musical intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cope | first = David | title = Experiments in Musical Intelligence | publisher = A-R Editions | location = Madison | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-89579-337-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which take the form of a computer program called EMI which produces music in the form of, say, Bach, or Chopin, or Cope.

Cope's programs are written in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], which turns out to be a popular language for research in cognitive musicology.  Desain and Honing have exploited Lisp in their efforts to tap the potential of microworld methodology in cognitive musicology research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Honing | first1 = H | year = 1993 | title = A microworld approach to formalizing musical knowledge | url = | journal = Computers and the Humanities | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 41â47 | doi=10.1007/bf01830716}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also working in Lisp, Heinrich Taube has explored computer composition from a wide variety of perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Taube | first = Heinrich | title = Notes from the Metalevel | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-90-265-1975-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are, of course, researchers who chose to use languages other than Lisp for their research into the computational modeling of musical processes.  Tim Rowe, for example, explores "machine musicianship" through C++ programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rowe | first = Robert | title = Machine Musicianship | publisher = MIT Pr | location = City | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-262-68149-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A rather different computational methodology for researching musical phenomena is the toolkit approach advocated by David Huron.&lt;ref&gt;Huron, D. (2002). Music Information Processing Using the Humdrum Toolkit: Concepts, Examples, and Lessons. "Computer Music Journal, 26" (2), 11â26.&lt;/ref&gt;  At a higher level of abstraction, Gerraint Wiggins has investigated general properties of music knowledge representations such as structural generality and expressive completeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiggins | first1 = G. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1993 | title = A Framework for the Evaluation of Music Representation Systems | url = | journal = Computer Music Journal | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 31â42 | doi=10.2307/3680941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a great deal of cognitive musicology research features symbolic computation, notable contributions have been made from the biologically inspired computational paradigms.  For example, [[Jamshed Bharucha]] and Peter Todd have modeled music perception in tonal music with neural networks.&lt;ref&gt;Bharucha, J. J., &amp; Todd, P. M. (1989). Modeling the perception of tonal structure with neural nets. ''Computer Music Journal'', 44â53&lt;/ref&gt;  Al Biles has applied genetic algorithms to the composition of jazz solos.&lt;ref&gt;Biles, J. A. 1994. "GenJam: A Genetic Algorithm for Generating Jazz Solos." Proceedings of the 1994 International Computer Music Conference. San Francisco: International Computer Music Association&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous researchers have explored algorithmic composition grounded in a wide range of mathematical formalisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nierhaus | first = Gerhard | title = Algorithmic Composition | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-3-211-75539-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cope | first = David | title = Computer Models of Musical Creativity | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-262-03338-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[cognitive psychology]], among the most prominent researchers is [[Diana Deutsch]], who has engaged in a wide variety of work ranging from studies of absolute pitch and musical illusions to the formulation of musical knowledge representations to relationships between music and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Deutsch | first = Diana | title = The Psychology of Music | publisher = Academic Press | location = Boston | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-12-213565-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Equally important is Aniruddh D. Patel, whose work combines traditional methodologies of cognitive psychology with [[neuroscience]].  Patel is also the author of a comprehensive survey of cognitive science research on music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Patel | first = Aniruddh | title =Music, Language, and the Brain | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-12-213565-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most significant contribution to viewing music from a linguistic perspective is the [[Generative Theory of Tonal Music]] (GTTM) proposed by [[Fred Lerdahl]] and [[Ray Jackendoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lerdahl | first = Fred |author2=Ray Jackendoff | title = A Generative Theory of Tonal Music | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-262-62107-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although GTTM is presented at the algorithmic level of abstraction rather than the implementational level, their ideas have found computational manifestations in a number of computational projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katz|first=Jonah|author2=David Pesetsky|title=The Recursive Syntax and Prosody of Tonal Music|journal=Recursion: Structural Complexity in Language and Cognition|date=May 2009|volume=Conference at UMass Amherst|url=http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/pesetsky/Katz_Pesetsky_Recursion_Conference_Music.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamanaka|first=Masatoshi|author2=Hirata, Keiji |author3=Tojo, Satoshi |title=Implementing 'A Generative Theory of Tonal Music'|journal=Journal of New Music Research|date=2006|volume=35|issue=4|pages=249â277|doi=10.1080/09298210701563238}}&lt;!--|accessdate=21 May 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

For the German-speaking area, Laske's conception of cognitive musicology has been advanced by Uwe Seifert in his book ''Systematische Musiktheorie und Kognitionswissenschaft. Zur Grundlegung der kognitiven Musikwissenschaft'' ("Systematic music theory and cognitive science. The foundation of cognitive musicology")&lt;ref&gt;Uwe Seifert: ''Systematische Musiktheorie und Kognitionswissenschaft. Zur Grundlegung der kognitiven Musikwissenschaft''. Orpheus Verlag fÃ¼r systematische Musikwissenschaft, Bonn 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  and  subsequent publications.

== Music and language acquisition skills ==
Both music and speech rely on sound processing and require interpretation of several sound features such as timbre, pitch, duration, and their interactions (Elzbieta, 2015). A fMRI study revealed that the Broca's and Wernicke's areas, two areas that are known to activated during speech and language processing, were found activated while the subject was listening to unexpected musical chords (Elzbieta, 2015). This relation between language and music may explain why, it has been found that exposure to music has produced an acceleration in the development of behaviors related to the acquisition of language. The Suzuki music education which is very widely known, emphasizes learning music by ear over reading musical notation and preferably begins with formal lessons between the ages of 3 and 5 years. One fundamental reasoning in favor of this education points to a parallelism between natural speech acquisition and purely auditory based musical training as opposed to musical training due to visual cues. There is evidence that children who take music classes have obtained skills to help them in language acquisition and learning (Oechslin, 2015), an ability that relies heavily on the dorsal pathway. Other studies show an overall enhancement of verbal intelligence in children taking music classes. Since both activities tap into several integrated brain functions and have shared brain pathways it is understandable why strength in music acquisition might also correlate with strength in language acquisition.

== Music and pre-natal development ==
Extensive prenatal exposure to a melody has been shown to induce neural representations that last for several months. In a study done by Partanen in 2013, mothers in the learning group listened to the âTwinkle twinkle little star' melody 5 times per week during their last trimester. After birth and again at the age of 4 months, they played the infants in the control and learning group a modified melody in which some of the notes were changed. Both at birth and at the age of 4 months, infants in the ''learning group'' had stronger event related potentials to the unchanged notes than the ''control group''. Since listening to music at a young age can already map out neural representations that are lasting, exposure to music could help strengthen brain plasticity in areas of the brain that are involved in language and speech processing.

== Music therapy effect on cognitive disorders ==
If neural pathways can be stimulated with entertainment there is a higher chance that it will be more easily accessible. This illustrates why music is so powerful and can be used in such a myriad of different therapies. Music that is enjoyable to a person illicit an interesting response that we are all aware of. Listening to music is not perceived as a chore because it is enjoyable, however our brain is still learning and utilizing the same brain functions as it would when speaking or acquiring language. Music has the capability to be a very productive form of therapy mostly because it is stimulating, entertaining, and appears rewarding. Using fMRI, Menon and Levitin found for the first time that listening to music strongly modulates activity in a network of mesolimbic structures involved in reward processing. This included the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), as well as the hypothalamus, and insula, which are all thought to be involved in regulating autonomic and physiological responses to rewarding and emotional stimuli (Gold, 2013).

Pitch perception was positively correlated with phonemic awareness and reading abilities in children (Flaugnacco, 2014). Likewise, the ability to tap to a rhythmic beat correlated with performance on reading and attention tests (Flaugnacco, 2014). These are only a fraction of the studies that have linked reading skills with rhythmic perception, which is shown in a meta-analysis of 25 cross-sectional studies that found a significant association between music training and reading skills (Butzlaff, 2000). Since the correlation is so extensive it is natural that researchers have tried to see if music could serve as an alternative pathway to strengthen reading abilities in people with developmental disorders such as dyslexia. Dyslexia is a disorder characterized by a long lasting difficulty in reading acquisition, specifically text decoding. Reading results have been shown to be slow and inaccurate, despite adequate intelligence and instruction. The difficulties have been shown to stem from a phonological core deficit that impacts reading comprehension, memory and prediction abilities (Flaugnacco, 2014). It was shown that music training modified reading and phonological abilities even when these skills are severely impaired. By improving temporal processing and rhythm abilities, through training, phonological awareness and reading skills in children with dyslexia were improved. The OPERA hypothesis proposed by Patel (2011), states that since music places higher demands on the process than speech it bring brings adaptive brain plasticity of the same neural network involved in language processing.

Parkinson's disease is a complex neurological disorder that negatively impacts both motor and non-motor functions caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (Ashoori, 2015). This in turn leads to a DA deficiency in the basal ganglia. The deficiencies of dopamine in these areas of the brain have shown to cause symptoms such as tremors at rest, rigidity, akinesia, and postural instability. They are also associated with impairments of internal timing of an individual (Ashoori, 2015). Rhythm is a powerful sensory cue that has shown to help regulate motor timing and coordination when there is a deficient internal timing system in the brain. Some studies have shown that musically cued gait training significantly improves multiple deficits of Parkinsons, including in gait, motor timing, and perceptual timing. Ashoori's study consisted of 15 non-demented patients with idiopathic Parkinson's who had no prior musical training and maintained their dopamine therapy during the trials. There were three 30-min training sessions per week for 1 month where the participants walked to the beats of German folk music without explicit instructions to synchronize their footsteps to the beat. Compared to pre-training gait performance, the Parkinson's patients showed significant improvement in gait velocity and stride length during the training sessions. The gait improvement was sustained for 1 month after training, which indicates a lasting therapeutic effect. Even though this was uncued it shows how the gait of these Parkinson's patients was automatically synchronized with the rhythm of the music. Also the lasting therapeutic effect shows that this might have affected the internal timing of the individual in a way that could not be accessed by other means.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2047">The '''ComitÃ© International d'Histoire de l'Art''' (CIHA) is an international committee that endeavors to improve [[art history|art historical]] research.

It was created in 1930 in order to develop the historical and methodological study of artistic activities and productions; to ensure permanent links between [[art historian]]s of all countries; to improve methods of art historical teaching and research; and to increase the research resources available to art historians, i.e. data bases, bibliographies, photographic and [[Iconography|iconographical]] documentation. It stimulates international meetings of art historians and co-ordinates the dissemination of information about research undertaken under the aegis of the committee. Its conferences, publications and research projects disseminate information and publicity about art historical activities world-wide.

The CIHA is currently directed by Professor LaoZhu from Peking University in China. Former director is Georg Ulrich GroÃmann, director of the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]]. Former members of the board included [[Millard Meiss]], [[Herbert von Einem]], [[Jan Gerrit Van Gelder]], [[Mario Salmi]], [[AndrÃ© Chastel]], [[Jacques Thuillier]], [[Jan BiaÅostocki]] and many other well-known art historians.

Every four years, the ComitÃ© International d'Histoire de l'Art holds a major Congress. The thirty-fourth Congress in the History of Art, organized by CIHA members, took place in Beijing, China, in September 2016. 

The [[National Committee for the History of Art]] (NCHA) is the U.S. affiliate of the ComitÃ© International d'Histoire de l'Art.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8049">'''Ecologically sustainable development''' is the environmental component of [[sustainable development]]. It can be achieved partially through the use of the [[precautionary principle]]; if there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent [[environmental degradation]].
Also important is the principle of [[intergenerational equity]]; the present generation should ensure that the health, diversity and productivity of the environment is maintained or enhanced for the benefit of future generations. In order for this movement to flourish, environmental factors should be more heavily weighed in the valuation of assets and services to provide more incentive for the conservation of biological diversity and ecological integrity.

==Political considerations==
Effective political support is necessary for ecologically sustainable development. The mobilization of governments can be translated into action plans that are crucial to [[Sustainable development#Politics|sustainable development]]. Development efforts can be influenced by patterns of family arrangements, work attitudes, [[Morality|social morality]]âparticularly interpersonal responsibilities, hierarchy of authority, quality of scientific education and implementation, and degree of domestic stabilityâespecially, freedom from [[social conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;Bakari, Mohamed El-Kamel.

Canada has taken an evidence based approach to sustainability development by using Environmental [[Sustainability measurement|Sustainability Indicators]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ec.gc.ca/indicateurs-indicators/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=47F48106-1 |title=Environmental Sustainability Indicators |author=Government of Canada|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as guiding tool for policy development.

==Forums for ecologically sustainable development==
The World Conservation Strategy was published in 1980, becoming one of the most encouraging developments that uses a goal-oriented programme for political change concerning ecological sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Robert P.|title=How to Save the World: Strategy for World Conservation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwghAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP1|year=1980|publisher=Barnes and Noble Books|isbn=978-0-389-20011-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The publication marked a fundamental policy shift for the global [[conservation movement]]. The traditional focus became cure rather than [[Prevention Science|Prevention]], confirming the growing trend on the assimilation of preservation and development aims that are key to an ecologically sustainable society. Specifically, the concentration on [[wildlife conservation]] drifted into a concern for wider strains degrading the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCormick|first=John|title=The Origins of the World Conservation Strategy|journal=Environmental Review|year=1986|volume=10|issue=3|pages=177â187|jstor=3984544}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It promotes the principles of sustainable development and addresses the environmental concerns introduced by [[economic development]] decisions with a format that targets a wide audience. There are three chief conservation objectives:
#Maintaining essential [[biogeochemical cycle]]s and life-support systems
#Preserving [[genetic diversity]]
#Establishing a sustainable use of [[species]] and [[ecosystem]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Susan L.|title=Ecologically Sustainable Development: Integrating Economics, Ecology, and Law|journal=Willamette Law Review|year=1995|volume=31|issue=2|pages=261â306|url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=31+Willamette+L.+Rev.+261&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=118207f62b4908b2ee0eb7a21f829a93|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other efforts such as the World Campaign for the Biosphere present environmental obstacles constantly before governmental and scientific authorities. Nicholas Polunin, former president of the Foundation for Environmental Conservation, believed the starting point for the World Campaign effort occurred in 1966 at an [[UNESCO]] conference in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polunin|first=Nicholas|title=Our Global Environment and the World Campaign for the Biosphere|journal=Environmental Conservation|year=1982|volume=9|issue=02|pages=115|doi=10.1017/S0376892900020002}}&lt;!--|accessdate=4 April 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The conference examined conditions that hinder ecologically sustainable development such as rapid [[population growth]], proliferation of [[nuclear weapon]]s, and depletion of [[natural resource]]s. Similarly, the [[The Global 2000 Report to the President|Global 2000 Report to the President]], presents environmental prospective conditions that are likely to worsen if public policies, institutions, and rates of technologic advancement do not change. Findings of this type prompted [[environmentalist]]s and the Foundation for Environmental Conservation to initiate the World Campaign project and have included the following suggestions:
:*Publication and broadcast of [[environmental issue]]s
:*Use of traditional [[Media (communication)|communication mediums]] such as posters and automobile stickers
:*Distribution of increasing basic and applied environmental research results
:*Information about [[family planning]] and the necessity to control population growth
:*Designating more area as [[national park]]s or [[wilderness area]]s, including the ocean
:*Organization of local, state, national, and international conferences to discuss environmental issues
:*Encouraging sustainable uses of our natural resources
:*Establishment of [[common law]]s for the Earth and mankind
:*Obtaining support form [[nongovernmental organization]]s and [[institution]]s for the World Campaign
:*Attaining recognition such as "Guardians of the Biosphere Awards," for persons and/or groups that demonstrate actions to preserve the environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barman|first=Charles R.|title=The World Campaign for the Biosphere|journal=The American Biology Teacher|volume=46|issue=5|pages=269â271|doi=10.2307/4447840|jstor=4447840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Expertization''' is the process of [[authentication]] of an object, usually of a sort that is [[collecting|collected]], by an individual [[expert|authority]] or a committee of authorities. The expert, or expert committee, examines the collectible and issues a certificate typically including:

* A statement of:
** Whether or not the item is authentic
** Identification of any damage to the item
** Identification of any repairs to the item
** Identification of any forgery or faked parts of the item
* A photo of the item

Some experts apply a mark or signature to the item attesting its genuineness.

Expertization is particularly common with valuable [[philatelic]] items, some of which are so often forged that they may be unsaleable without it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21686">'''German studies''' is the field of [[humanities]] that researches, documents, and disseminates [[German language]] and [[German literature|literature]] in both its historic and present forms. Academic departments of German studies often include classes on [[Culture of Germany|German culture]], [[German history]], and [[German politics]] in addition to the language and literature component. Common German names for the field are {{lang|de|Germanistik}}, {{lang|de|Deutsche Philologie}}, and {{lang|de|Deutsche Sprachwissenschaft und Literaturwissenschaft}}. In English the terms '''Germanistics''' or '''Germanics''' are sometimes used (mostly by Germans), but the subject is more often referred to as ''German studies'', ''German language and literature'', or ''German philology''.

Modern German studies is usually seen as a combination of two sub-disciplines:  German linguistics and Germanophone literature studies.

==German linguistics==

German linguistics is traditionally called [[philology]] in Germany, as there is something of a difference between philologists and linguists{{vague|date=September 2012}}. It is roughly divided as follows:
* [[Old High German]] (''Althochdeutsch'') 8th â 11th centuries
* [[Middle High German]] (''Mittelhochdeutsch'') 11th â 14th centuries
* [[Early New High German]] (''FrÃ¼hneuhochdeutsch'') 14th â 17th centuries
* [[Modern German]] ([[Standard German]], [[German dialectology]]) 18th â 21st centuries

In addition, the discipline examines German under various aspects: the way it is spoken and written, i.e., spelling; declination; vocabulary; sentence structure; texts; etc. It compares the various manifestations such as social groupings (slang, written texts, etc.) and geographical groupings (dialects, etc.).

==German literature studies==

The study [[German literature]] is divided into two parts: {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} ''Ãltere Deutsche Literaturwissenschaft'' deals with the period from the beginnings of German in the early Middle Ages up to post-Medieval times around AD 1750, while the modern era is covered by ''Neuere Deutsche Literaturwissenschaft''. The field systematically examines German literature in terms of [[genre]], [[wikt:form|form]], [[Content (media and publishing)|content]], and [[Motif (literature)|motif]]s as well as looking at it historically by author and epoch.  Important areas include [[edition philology]], [[history of literature]], and [[textual interpretation]].  The relationships of German literature to the literatures of other languages (e.g. reception and mutual influences) and historical contexts are also important areas of concentration. ''The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory: Fourth Edition'' ({{ISBN|0-14-051363-9}}) is printed in English but contains many [[German-language]] literary terms that apply cross-culturally in the field of [[literary criticism]]; quite a few of the in terms in the book originated in German but have since been adopted by [[English-language]] critics and scholars.

== German teacher education ==
At least in Germany and Austria, German studies in academia play a central role in the education of German school teachers. Their courses usually cover four fields:&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. the left navigation at the web page of one of the [[Cologne University]] German studies institutes at http://idsl1.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Linguistics]] of [[German language|German]] (''{{lang|de|Sprachwissenschaft}}'')
* German language and literature of up to about 1750 (''{{lang|de|Ãltere Sprache und Literatur}}'')
* German language and literature since approximately 1750 (''{{lang|de|Neuere Literaturwissenschaft}}'')
* Specifics of the [[didactics]] of teaching German (''{{lang|de|Fachdidaktik}}'')
Several universities offer specialized curriculae for school teachers, usually called "''{{lang|de|Deutsch (Lehramt)}}''". In Germany, they are leading to a two step exam and certificate by the [[federal states of Germany]] cultural authorities, called the ''{{lang|de|[[Staatsexamen]]}}'' ("state exam").

==German media studies==
In recent years{{when|date=September 2012}}, German{{who|date=September 2012}} has looked for links with the fields of [[communication]]s, [[cultural studies]] and [[media studies]].  In addition, the sub-branch of [[film studies]] has established itself.

==History==

As an unsystematic field of interest for individual scholars, German studies can be traced back to [[Tacitus]]' ''Germania''. The publication and study of legal and historical source material, such as Medieval [[Bible]] translations, were all undertaken during the [[German Renaissance]] of the sixteenth century, truly initiating the field of German studies.  As an independent university subject, German studies was introduced at the beginning of the nineteenth century by  [[Georg Friedrich Benecke]], the [[Brothers Grimm]], and [[Karl Lachmann]].

There are two forms of carbon credit, those that are part of national and international trade and those that are purchased by individuals. Internationally, to achieve Kyoto Protocol objectives, âcapsâ (limits) on participating countryâs emissions are established. To meet these limits countries, in turn, set âcapsâ (allowances or credits: 1 convertible and transferable credit = 1 metric tonne of {{CO2}}-e emissions) for operators. Operators that meet the agreed âcapsâ can then sell unused credits to operators who exceed âcapsâ. Operators can then choose the most cost-effective way of reducing emissions. Individual carbon credits would operate in a similar way cf. carbon offset.

*'''[[detritus]]''' - non-living particulate organic material (as opposed to dissolved organic material).
*'''[[developing countries]]''' â development of a country is measured using a mix of economic factors (income per capita, GDP, degree of modern infrastructure (both physical and institutional), degree of industrialisation, proportion of economy devoted to agriculture and natural resource extraction) and social factors (life expectancy, the rate of literacy, poverty). The UN-produced Human Development Index (HDI) is a compound indicator of the above statistics. There is a strong correlation between low income and high population growth, both within and between countries. In developing countries, there is low per capita income, widespread poverty, and low capital formation. In developed countries there is continuous economic growth and a relatively high standard of living. The term is value-laden and prescriptive, as it implies a natural transition from "undeveloped" to "developed" when such transitions can instead be imposed. Although poverty and physical deprivation are clearly undesirable, it does not follow that it is therefore desirable for "undeveloped" economies to move towards affluent Western-style "developed" free market economies. The terms "industrialised" and "non-industrialised" are no different in this assumption.

[[File:Regular_hexagon_as_intersection_of_two_triangles.png|thumb|A regular ''hexagram'', [[List_of_regular_polytopes_and_compounds#Two_dimensional_compounds|{6}[2{3}]{6}]], can be seen as a [[compound polygon|compound]] composed of an upwards (blue here) and downwards (pink) facing [[equilateral triangle]], with their intersection as a regular [[hexagon]] (in green).]]
A '''hexagram''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]) or '''sexagram''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]) is a six-pointed geometric [[star figure]] with the [[SchlÃ¤fli symbol]] {6/2}, 2{3}, or &lt;nowiki&gt;{{3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Since there are no true regular continuous hexagrams, the term is instead used to refer to the compound figure of two [[equilateral triangle]]s shown to the right. The intersection is a regular [[hexagon]].

The hexagram is part of an infinite series of shapes which are compounds of two n-dimensional [[simplex|simplices]]. In three dimensions, [[Compound of two tetrahedra|the analogous compound]] is the [[stellated octahedron]], and in four dimensions the [[compound of two 5-cells]] is obtained.

It has been historically used in religious and cultural contexts and as decorative motifs; for example by medieval [[Muslims]], especially [[Hanafi]] and [[Maliki]] dynasties,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Delhi: Adventures in a Megacity]]'' (PB) - Page 91, Sam Miller, Sam - 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and later in [[Judaism]] and [[occultism]]. The symbol was used merely as a decorative motif in medieval Christian churches many centuries before its first known use in a Jewish synagogue.{{sfn|Scholem|1949|p=244|ps=:"It is not to be found at all in medieval synagogues or on medieval ceremonial objects, although it has been found in quite a number of medieval Christian churches again, not as a Christian symbol but only as a decorative motif. The appearance of the symbol in Christian churches long before its appearance in our synagogues should warn the overzealous interpreters. "}} It was first used as a religious symbol by Arabs in the medieval period, known as the [[Seal of Solomon]], depicted as either a hexagram or [[pentagram]], and which was later adopted by Jewish [[Kabbalists]].{{sfn|Scholem|1949|p=246|ps=:"In the beginning these designs had no special names or terms, and it is only in the Middle Ages that definite names began to be given to some of those most widely used. There is very little doubt that terms like these first became popular among the Arabs, who showed a tremendous interest in all the occult sciences, arranging and ordering them systematically long before the Practical Cabalists thought of doing so.{{pb}}It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that for a long time both the five-pointed and the six-pointed stars were called by one name, the "Seal of Solomon," and that no distinction was made between them. This name is obviously related to the Jewish legend of Solomon's dominion over the spirits, and of his ring with the Ineffable Name engraved on it. These legends expanded and proliferated in a marked fashion during the Middle Ages, among Jews and Arabs alike, but the name, "Seal of Solomon," apparently originated with the Arabs."}}&lt;ref&gt;Leonora Leet, "The Hexagram and Hebraic Sacred Science" in :''The Secret Doctrine of the Kabbalah'', 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=61hpoogearsC&amp;pg=PA212 pp. 212-217].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Group theory==
In [[mathematics]], the [[root system]] for the simple [[Lie group]] [[G2 (mathematics)|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] is in the form of a hexagram, with six long roots and six short roots.&lt;br/&gt;
[[File:Root system G2.svg|250px]]

== Construction by compass and a straight edge ==
A six-pointed star, like a [[regular hexagon]], can be created using a compass and a straight edge:
*Make a circle of any size with the compass.
*Without changing the radius of the compass, set its pivot on the circle's circumference, and find one of the two points where a new circle would intersect the first circle.
*With the pivot on the last point found, similarly find a third point on the circumference, and repeat until six such points have been marked.
*With a straight edge, join alternate points on the circumference to form two overlapping equilateral triangles.

== Construction by linear algebra ==
[[File:Hexagram-cube.png|thumb]]
A regular hexagram can be constructed by [[orthographic projection|orthographically projecting]] any [[cube]] onto a plane through three vertices that are all adjacent to the same vertex.  The twelve midpoints to edges of the cube form a hexagram.  For example, consider the projection of the unit cube with vertices at the eight possible binary vectors in three dimensions &lt;math&gt;(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1),(1,1,1)&lt;/math&gt; onto the plane &lt;math&gt;x+y+z=1&lt;/math&gt;.  The midpoints are &lt;math&gt;(0,0,1/2),(0,1/2,1/2),(0,1,1/2),(1,1,1/2)&lt;/math&gt;, and all points resulting from these by applying a permutation to their entries.  These 12 points project to a hexagram: six vertices around the outer hexagon and six on the inner.

==Origins and shape==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2009}}
It is possible that as a simple geometric shape, like for example the triangle, circle, or square, the hexagram has been created by various peoples with no connection to one another.

The hexagram is a [[mandala]] symbol called ''satkona yantra'' or ''sadkona yantra'' found on ancient South [[India]]n [[Hindu]] temples. It symbolizes the [[nara-narayana]], or perfect [[meditative]] state of balance achieved between Man and God, and if maintained, results in "[[moksha]]," or "[[nirvana]]" (release from the bounds of the earthly world and its material trappings).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Some researchers have theorized that the hexagram represents the [[astrological]] chart at the time of David's birth or [[anointment]] as king. The hexagram is also known as the "King's Star" in astrological circles.

In antique [[papyri]], [[pentagram]]s, together with stars and other signs, are frequently found on [[amulet]]s bearing the Jewish names of [[God]], and used to guard against fever and other diseases. Curiously the hexagram is not found among these signs. In the [[Greek Magical Papyri]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} (Wessely, l.c. pp.&amp;nbsp;31, 112) at Paris and London there are 22 signs side by side, and a circle with twelve signs, but neither a pentagram nor a hexagram.

==Usage in Dharmic religions==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Jain Cosmology0007small.JPG|thumb|Diagram showing the two mystic syllables Om and Hrim]]
Six-pointed stars have also been found in cosmological diagrams in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]. The reasons behind this symbol's common appearance in Indic religions and the West are unknown. One possibility is that they have a common origin. The other possibility is that artists and religious people from several cultures independently created the hexagram shape, which is a relatively simple geometric design.

Within Indic lore, the shape is generally understood to consist of two trianglesâone pointed up and the other downâlocked in harmonious embrace. The two components are called "Om" and the "Hrim" in Sanskrit, and symbolize man's position between earth and sky. The downward triangle symbolizes [[Shakti]], the sacred embodiment of femininity, and the upward triangle symbolizes [[Shiva]], or [[Agni Tattva]], representing the focused aspects of masculinity. The mystical union of the two triangles represents Creation, occurring through the divine union of male and female. The two locked triangles are also known as 'Shanmukha'âthe six-faced, representing the six faces of Shiva &amp; Shakti's progeny [[Kartikeya]]. This symbol is also a part of several yantras and has deep significance in Hindu ritual worship and history.

In [[Buddhism]], some old versions of the [[Bardo Thodol]], also known as The "Tibetan Book of the Dead", contain a hexagram with a [[Swastika]] inside. It was made up by the publishers for this particular publication. In Tibetan, it is called the "origin of phenomenon" (chos-kyi 'byung-gnas). It is especially connected with [[Vajrayogini]], and forms the center part of Her [[mandala]]. In reality, it is in three dimensions, not two, although it may be portrayed either way.

The [[Shatkona]] is a symbol used in [[Hindu]] [[yantra]] that represents the union of both the [[male]] and [[Female|feminine]] form. More specifically it is supposed to represent [[Purusha]] (the supreme being), and [[Prakriti]] (mother nature, or causal matter). Often this is represented as [[Shiva]] - [[Shakti]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sivasakti.com/articles/intro-yantra.html sivasakti.com: ''Iintroduction to Yantra'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shatkona is a hexagram and looks exactly like the [[Star of David]].

===Anahata: The Heart Chakra===
{| border="0"
|width=170 valign=top|[[File:Anahata Mandala.svg|center|170px]]
|valign=top|'''[[Anahata]]''' (also known as '''Anahata-puri''', or '''Padma-sundara''') is symbolized by a lotus flower with twelve petals. (See also [[bodhicitta|heartmind]]). Anahata is related to the colors green or pink. Key issues involving Anahata involve complex emotions, compassion, tenderness, unconditional love, equilibrium, rejection and well-being. Physically Anahata governs circulation, emotionally it governs unconditional love for the self and others, mentally it governs passion, and spiritually it governs devotion.&lt;ref&gt;The Chakra Bible, Patricia Mercier, Octopus Publishing Group Ltd., 2007, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|}
In the [[endocrine system]], [[Anahata]] is associated with the [[thymus]] gland, located in the chest. This gland produces [[T-cells]], that combat disease, and bring equilibrium to the body. The functioning of the [[thymus]] is greatest before [[puberty]] and is impaired by the appearance of [[sex hormones]] in the blood stream from [[puberty]] onwards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

==Usage by the Abrahamic religions==

===Usage by Jews===
{{Main|Star of David}}
[[File:Leningrad Codex Carpet page e.jpg|thumb|The Star of David in the oldest surviving complete copy of the [[Masoretic text]], the [[Leningrad Codex]], dated 1008.]]
The ''Magen David'' is a generally recognized symbol of Judaism and Jewish identity and is also known colloquially as the Jewish Star or "Star of David." Its usage as a sign of Jewish identity began in the Middle Ages, though its religious usage began earlier, with the current earliest archeological evidence being a stone bearing the shield from the arch of a 3â4th century synagogue in the Galilee.&lt;ref&gt;"King Solomon's Seal", ''MFA'', [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/King%20Solomon-s%20Seal King Solomon-s Seal].&lt;/ref&gt; A more enduring symbol of Judaism, the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], has been in use since about 1300 BC according to the [[Torah]] {{bibleverse||Exodus|25:31-40|HE}}.

===Usage by Christians===
The hexagram may be found in some Churches and stained-glass windows. In Christianity it is sometimes called the star of creation.  A very early example, noted by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], can be found in [[Winchester Cathedral]], England in one of the canopies of the choir stalls, circa 1308.&lt;ref&gt;Buildings of England: Hampshire and the North (now second edition) {{ISBN|978 0 300 12084 4}}, p.604. &lt;/ref&gt;

In Balkan countries, hexagrams can be found more often in Orthodox Christian churches than in Roman Catholic churches.  
 
====Latter-day Saints (Mormons)====
[[File:Salt Lake Assembly Hall Star of David.jpg|thumb|Star of David on the [[Salt Lake Assembly Hall]]]]
{{Main|Mormonism and Judaism}}
The Star of David is also used less prominently by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], in the temples and in architecture. It symbolizes God reaching down to man and man reaching up to God, the union of Heaven and earth. It may also symbolize the [[Israelite|Tribes of Israel]] and friendship and their affinity towards the Jewish people. Additionally, it is sometimes used to symbolize the quorum of the twelve apostles, as in Revelation 12, wherein the Church of God is symbolized by a woman wearing a crown of twelve stars. It is also sometimes used to symbolize the Big Dipper, which points to the North Star, a symbol of Jesus Christ.

====Rastafari====
A black star of David is used to identify the black population, in Africa or otherwise, with one of the [[Israelite|Tribes of Israel]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
Due to the culture of Rastafari emerging out of the Judeo-Christian Ethiopian history, dating back to Solomonic dynastic rule, the star of David, or the Seal of Solomon is a prevalent symbol amongst its adherents. Rastafari has adherents from every race across the globe, rooted in Christian doctrine, it is not an African or bloodline doctrine.

The symbol is known in Arabic as ''KhÄtem SulaymÄn'' ([[Seal of Solomon]]; {{lang|ar|Ø®Ø§ØªÙ Ø³ÙÙÙØ§Ù}}) or ''Najmat DÄwÅ«d'' ([[Star of David]]; {{lang|ar|ÙØ¬ÙØ© Ø¯Ø§ÙÙØ¯}}). The "Seal of Solomon" may also be represented by a five-pointed star or [[pentagram]].

In the [[Qur'an]], it is written that David and [[King Solomon]] (Arabic, ''Suliman'' or ''Sulayman'') were prophets and kings, and are figures revered by Muslims. The Medieval pre-Ottoman [[Hanafi]] [[Anatolian beyliks]] of the [[Karamanids]] and [[Jandarids]] used the star on their flag.&lt;ref name="Muwahhidists"&gt;The Muslim Empires of the Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, By Stephen F. Dale, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol also used on [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] flag. Today the six-pointed star can be found in [[mosques]] and on other [[Arabic Art|Arabic]] and [[Islamic art]]ifacts.

Professor [[Gershom Sholem|Gershom Scholem]] theorizes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-curious-history-of-the-six-pointed-starhow-the-magen-david-became-the-jewish-symbol/|title=The Curious History of the Six-Pointed Star:How the âMagen Davidâ Became the Jewish Symbol - Commentary Magazine|work=Commentary Magazine|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the "Star of David" originates in the writings of [[Aristotle]], who used triangles in different positions to indicate the different basic elements. The superposed triangles thus represented combinations of those elements. From Aristotle's writings those symbols made their ways into early, pre-Muslim Arab literature.

==Usage in heraldry==
In [[heraldry]] and [[vexillology]], a hexagram is a fairly common charge employed, though it is rarely called by this name. In Germanic regions it is known simply as a "star." In English and French heraldry, however, the hexagram is known as a "mullet of six points," where ''mullet'' is a French term for a [[spur|spur rowel]] which is shown with five pointed arms by default unless otherwise specified. In [[Albania]]n heraldry and vexillology, hexagram has been used since [[classical antiquity]] and it is commonly referred to as ''sixagram''. [[:File:Coa Kastrioti Family.svg|Coa Kastrioti Family]] of the [[House of Kastrioti]] depicts the hexagram on a '''[[pile (heraldry)|pile]]''' argent over the double headed eagle. A hexagram also appears on the '''Dardania''' Flag, proposed for [[Kosovo]] by the [[Democratic League of Kosovo]].

==Usage in theosophy==
The Star of David is used in the seal and the emblem of the [[Theosophical Society]] (founded in 1875). Although it is more pronounced, it is used along with other religious symbols. These include the [[Swastika]], the [[Ankh]], the [[Om|Aum]], and the [[Ouroboros]]. The star of David is also known as the Seal of Solomon that was its original name until around 50 years ago.

==Usage in occultism==
The hexagram, like the [[pentagram]], was and is used in practices of the [[occult]] and [[ceremonial magic]] and is attributed to the 7 "old" planets outlined in [[astrology]].

The six-pointed star is commonly used both as a [[talisman]]&lt;ref&gt;P299 (and throughout) of ''The Complete Goldendawn'' by Israel Regardie. {{ISBN|978-0875426631}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for conjuring spirits and spiritual forces in diverse forms of [[Magic (paranormal)|occult magic]]. In the book [[The History and Practice of Magic, Vol. 2]], the six-pointed star is called the talisman of Saturn and it is also referred to as the Seal of Solomon.&lt;ref&gt;"The History and Practice of Magic" (Secaucus, NJ: University Books, published by arrangement with Lyle Stewart, 1979), Vol. II, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Details are given in this book on how to make these symbols and the materials to use.
[[File:Star of David GGNC grave marker engraving.JPG|thumb|200x200px|Double hexagram.]]
Traditionally, the Hexagram can be seen as the combination of the four elements. Fire is symbolized as an upwards pointing triangle, while Air (its elemental opposite) is also an upwards pointing triangle, but with a horizontal line through its center. Water is symbolized as a downwards pointing triangle, while Earth (its elemental opposite) is also a downwards pointing triangle, but with a horizontal line through its center. When you combine the symbols of Fire and Water, a hexagram (six-pointed star) is created. The same follows for when you combine the symbols of Air and Earth.  When you combine both hexagrams, you get the double-hexagram. Thus, a combination of the elements is created.&lt;ref&gt;P315-316 of ''The Wicca Bible'' by Ann-Marie Gallagher. {{ISBN|978-1-84181-250-2}}. Same information also found in many other books.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] Magic, the seven Traditional Planets correspond with the angles and the center of the Hexagram as follows, in the same patterns as they appear on the [[Sephiroth]] and on the [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]. Saturn, although formally attributed to the Sephira of [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]], within this frame work nonetheless occupies the position of [[Da'at (Kabbalah)|Daath]].&lt;ref&gt;P31 of ''The Ritual Magic Manual: A Complete Course in Practical Magic'' by David Griffin. {{ISBN|978-0965840897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in Freemasonry==
{{quote|"The interlacing triangles or deltas symbolize the union of the two principles or forces, the active and passive, male and female, pervading the universe ... The two triangles, one white and the other black, interlacing, typify the mingling of apparent opposites in nature, darkness and light, error and truth, ignorance and wisdom, evil and good, throughout human life." â&amp;nbsp;Albert G. Mackey: ''Encyclopedia of [[Freemason]]ry''}}

The hexagram is featured within and on the outside of many [[Masonic temple]]s as a decoration. It may have been found within the structures of [[King Solomon]]'s temple, from which [[Freemasons]] are inspired in their philosophies and studies. Like many other symbols in Freemasonry, the deciphering of the hexagram is non-dogmatic and left to the interpretation of the individual.

* In [[alchemy]], the two triangles represent the reconciliation of the opposites of fire and water. Non-Jewish Kabbalah (also called Christian or Hermetic Kabbalah) interprets{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} the hexagram to mean the divine union of male and female energy, where the male is represented by the upper triangle and the female by the lower one. Moreover, it derives four triangular symbols from it (two triangles crossed like a capital letter A and two uncrossed) to represent the four elements: water, fire, air, and earth. This use of the symbol was used as an important plot point in [[Dan Brown]]'s popular novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and [[Da Vinci Code (film)|the ''Da Vinci Code'' film]] cites this as the origin of the star.
* It was also used as a sign for [[Aether (classical element)#Fifth element|quintessence]], the fifth element.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* In southern Germany the hexagram can be found as part of tavern anchors. It is symbol for the tapping of beer and sign of the brewer's guild. In German this is called "Bierstern" (beer star) or "[[:de:Brauerstern|Brauerstern]]" (brewer's star).

A '''hierarchy of genres''' is any formalization which ranks different  [[genre]]s in an art form in terms of their prestige and cultural value.

In literature, the [[Epic poetry|epic]] was considered the highest form, for the reason expressed by [[Samuel Johnson]] in his ''Life of [[John Milton]]'': "By the general consent of criticks, the first praise of genius is due to the writer of an epick poem, as it requires an assemblage of all the powers which are singly sufficient for other compositions."  Below that came [[lyric poetry]], and comic poetry, with a similar ranking for [[drama]]. The [[novel]] took a long time to establish a firm place in the hierarchy, doing so only as belief in any systematic hierarchy of forms expired in the 19th century.

In music, settings of words were accorded a higher status than merely instrumental works, at least until the [[Baroque]] period, and [[opera]] retained a superior status for much longer.  The status of works also varies with the number of players and singers involved, with those for large forces, which are certainly more difficult to write and more expensive to perform, given higher status. Any element of comedy reduced the status of a work, though, as in other art forms, often increasing its popularity.

The hierarchies in figurative art are those initially formulated for painting in 16th-century Italy, which held sway with little alteration until the early 19th century.  These were formalized and promoted by the [[Academy|academies]] in Europe between the 17th century and the modern era, of which the most influential became the French [[AcadÃ©mie de peinture et de sculpture]], which held a central role in [[Academic art]].  The fully developed hierarchy distinguished between:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Belton|first1=Dr. Robert J.|title=Art History: A Preliminary Handbook|chapter=The Elements of Art|date=1996|chapter-url=http://fccs.ok.ubc.ca/about/links/resources/arthistory/elements.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[History painting]], including historically important, religious, mythological, or allegorical subjects
*[[Portrait painting]]
*[[Genre works|Genre painting]] or scenes of everyday life
*[[landscape art|Landscape]] and cityscape art (landscapists were called "common [[infantry|footmen]] in the Army of Art" by the Dutch theorist [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]])
*[[Animal painting]]
*[[Still life]]

The hierarchy was based on a distinction between art that made an intellectual effort to "render visible the universal essence of things" (''imitare'' in Italian) and that which merely consisted of "mechanical copying of particular appearances" (''ritrarre'').&lt;ref&gt;Bass, 36 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6TSDvkud168C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=Hierarchy+of+genres+painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Idealism]] was privileged over [[Philosophical realism|realism]] in line with [[Renaissance Neo-Platonist]] philosophy.

The term is mostly used within the field of painting, and from the [[High Renaissance]] onwards, by which time painting had asserted itself as the highest form of art.  This had not been the case in [[Medieval art]] and the art-commissioning sectors of society took a considerable period to fully accept this view.  The [[Raphael Cartoons]] are a clear example of the continuing status of [[tapestry]], the most expensive form of art in the 16th century.  In the Early Medieval period lavish pieces of metalwork had typically been the most highly regarded, and valuable materials remained an important ingredient in the appreciation of art until at least the 17th century.  Until the 19th century the most extravagant [[objets d'art]] remained more expensive, both new and on the art market, than all but a few paintings.  Classical writings which valued the supreme skills of individual artists were influential, as well as developments in art which allowed the Renaissance artist to demonstrate their skill and invention to a greater degree than was usually possible in the Middle Ages.

==Renaissance art==
The hierarchy grew out of the struggle  to gain acceptance of painting as one of the [[Liberal arts]], and then controversies to establish an equal or superior status within them with [[architecture]] and [[sculpture]].  These matters were considered of great importance by artist-theorists such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and [[Giorgio Vasari]].  Against the sculptors, Leonardo argued that the intellectual effort necessary to create an illusion of three-dimensionality made the painters' art superior to that of the sculptor, who could do so merely by recording appearances.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 28, 53-4&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''[[De Pictura]]'' ("About Painting") of 1441, Alberti argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which required mastery of all the others, because it was a visual form of history, and because it had the greatest potential to move the viewer.  He placed emphasis on the ability to depict the interactions between the figures by gesture and expression.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 11-12,&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorists of the Early and High Renaissance accepted the importance of representing nature closely, at least until the later writings of [[Michelangelo]], who was strongly influenced by [[neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 61, 65-74&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time of [[Mannerist]] theorists such as [[Gian Paolo Lomazzo]] and [[Federico Zuccari]] (both also painters) this was far less of a priority.  Both emphasized beauty as "something which was directly infused into the mind of man from the mind of God, and existed there independent of any sense-impressions", a view bound to further reduce the status of works depending on realism.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 140-141 (quote, 141)&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice the hierarchy represented little break with either medieval and classical thought, except to place secular history painting in the same class as religious art, and to distinguish (not always clearly) between static iconic religious subjects and narrative figure scenes, giving the latter a higher status.  Ideas of [[decorum]] also fed into the hierarchy; comic, sordid or merely frivolous subjects or treatment ranked lower than elevated and moral ones.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

During the Renaissance landscape, genre scenes and still lifes hardly existed as established genres, so discussion of the status or importance of different types of painting was mainly concerned with history subjects as against portraits, initially small and unpretentious, and iconic portrait-type religious and mythological subjects.  For most artists some commitment to realism was necessary in a portrait; few could take the high-handed approach of Michelangelo, who largely ignored the actual appearance of the [[Medici]] in his [[Medici Chapel]] sculptures, supposedly saying that in a thousand years no one would know the difference (a retort [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]] is also said to have used, with a shorter timeframe).&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;  

Many portraits were extremely flattering, which could be justified by an appeal to idealism as well as the sitter's vanity; the theorist [[Giovanni Battista Armenini|Armenini]]&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Battista Armenini (1533-1609) ''De vera precetti della pittura'' (1587), " On the True Precepts of the Art of Painting".&lt;/ref&gt; claimed in 1587 that "portraits by excellent artists are considered to be painted with better style [''maniera''] and greater perfection than others, but more often than not they are less good likenesses".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 23-24 (quote)&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, numbers of courtly sitters and their parents, suitors or courtiers complained that painters entirely failed to do justice to the reality of the sitter.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 38-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of decorum in religious art became the focus of intense effort by the Catholic Church after the [[Art in Roman Catholicism#Council of Trent|decrees on art of the Council of Trent]] of 1563.  Paintings depicting biblical events as if they were occurring in the households of wealthy contemporary Italians were attacked, and soon ceased.  Until the challenge of [[Caravaggio]] at the end of the century, religious art became thoroughly ideal.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

==17th and 18th century art==
The new genres of landscape, genre painting, animal painting and still life came into their own in the 17th century, with the virtual cessation of religious painting in Protestant countries, and the expansion of picture buying to the prosperous middle class.  Although similar developments occurred in all advanced European countries, they were most evident in the enormously productive schools of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting]].  However no theorists emerged to champion the new genres, and the relatively small amount of Dutch theoretical writing, by [[Karel van Mander]], [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]],&lt;ref&gt;''Inleyding tot de Hooge Schoole der Schilderkonst'' ( Rotterdam 1678), "Introduction to the Academy of Painting".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerard de Lairesse]] and others, was mostly content to rehash Italian views, so that their writings can seem oddly at variance with the Dutch art actually being produced in their day.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;

The hierarchy was mostly accepted by artists, and even genre specialists such as [[Jan Steen]], [[Karel Dujardin]] and [[Vermeer]] produced a few history paintings, which were better paid when commissions could be obtained, but in general far harder to sell.  The unhappy history of [[Rembrandt]]'s last history commission, ''[[The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis]]'' (1661) illustrates both his commitment to the form and the difficulties he had in finding an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 69-77&lt;/ref&gt;  In Flanders, as well as great quantities of pure genre works, there was a trend towards history paintings with a major genre element, whether animals, landscape or still life.  Often the different elements were painted by different artists; [[Rubens]] and [[Frans Snyders]] often co-operated in this way.

The size of paintings, and very often the prices they realized, increasingly tended to reflect their position in the hierarchy in this period. Until the Romantic period the price and saleability of what were essentially landscapes could be increased by adding small mythological or religious figures, creating a ''landscape with...'', a practice that went back to the beginnings of landscape painting in the Flemish [[world landscape]]s of [[Joachim Patinir]] in the early 16th century. [[Flemish Baroque painting]] was the last school to often paint the lowest genres at a large size, but usually combined with figure subjects.

An influential formulation of 1667 by [[AndrÃ© FÃ©libien]], a historiographer, architect and theoretician of French classicism became the classic statement of the theory for the 18th century:&lt;blockquote&gt;Celui qui fait parfaitement des paÃ¯sages est au-dessus d'un autre qui ne fait que des fruits, des fleurs ou des coquilles. Celui qui peint des animaux vivants est plus estimable que ceux qui ne reprÃ©sentent que des choses mortes &amp; sans mouvement ; &amp; comme la figure de l'homme est le plus parfait ouvrage de Dieu sur la Terre, il est certain aussi que celui qui se rend l'imitateur de Dieu en peignant des figures humaines, est beaucoup plus excellent que tous les autres ... un Peintre qui ne fait que des portraits, n'a pas encore cette haute perfection de l'Art, &amp; ne peut prÃ©tendre Ã  l'honneur que reÃ§oivent les plus sÃ§avans. Il faut pour cela passer d'une seule figure Ã  la reprÃ©sentation de plusieurs ensemble ; il faut traiter l'histoire &amp; la fable ; il faut reprÃ©senter de grandes actions comme les historiens, ou des sujets agrÃ©ables comme les PoÃ«tes ; &amp; montant encore plus haut, il faut par des compositions allÃ©goriques, sÃ§avoir couvrir sous le voile de la fable les vertus des grands hommes, &amp; les mystÃ¨res les plus relevez.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jl8IAeoj-7IC&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage&amp;q=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;f=false Books.google.co.uk], translation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He who produces perfect landscapes is above another who only produces fruit, flowers or seashells. He who paints living animals is more estimable than those who only represent dead things without movement, and as man is the most perfect work of God on the earth, it is also certain that he who becomes an imitator of God in representing human figures, is much more excellent than all the others ... a painter who only does portraits still does not have the highest perfection of his art, and cannot expect the honour due to the most skilled.  For that he must pass from representing a single figure to several together; history and myth must be depicted; great events must be represented as by historians, or like the poets, subjects that will please, and climbing still higher, he must have the skill to cover under the veil of myth the virtues of great men in allegories, and the mysteries they reveal".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Allegorical painting was raised above other types of [[history painting]]; together they were the ''grand genre'', including paintings with religious, mythological, historical, literary, or allegorical subjectsâthey embodied some interpretation of life or conveyed a moral or intellectual message. The gods and goddesses from the ancient mythologies represented different aspects of the human psyche, figures from religions represented different ideas, and history, like the other sources, represented a dialectic or play of ideas. Subjects with several figures ranked higher than single figures. For a long time, especially during the [[French Revolution]], history painting often focused on depiction of the heroic male nude; though this waned in the 19th century.

After history painting came, in order of decreasing worth: [[Portrait painting|portraits]], scenes of everyday life (called ''scÃ¨nes de genre'', or "[[Genre works|genre painting]]", and also ''petit genre'' to contrast it with the ''grande genre''), [[Landscape art|landscapes]], animal painting, and finally [[still life]]s. In his formulation, such paintings were inferior because they were merely reportorial pictures without moral force or artistic imagination. Genre paintingsâneither ideal in style, nor elevated in subjectâwere admired for their skill, ingenuity, and even humour, but never confused with high art. 

The hierarchy of genres also had a corresponding hierarchy of formats: large format for history paintings, small format for still lifes.  This had occasionally been breached in the past, especially in large Flemish works, and the monumental ''[[The Young Bull]]'' of the Dutch artist [[Paulus Potter]], as well as the larger of the two ''[[Butchers' Shop]]'' canvases of [[Annibale Carracci]].  But for the most part the relative prices obtainable for the different genres ensured the hierarchy of size also; it would not have been economic to paint a very large subject from the lower genres, except for commissioned group portraits.  Rubens' largest landscapes were painted for his own houses.

The use of the pictorial elements of painting such as line and color to convey an ultimate unifying theme or idea was regarded as the highest expression of art, and an idealism was adopted in art, whereby forms seen in nature would be generalized, and in turn subordinated to the unity of the artwork. It aimed at universal truth through the imitation of nature. Later  dissenting theorists, such as [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], held that this focus on [[allegory]] was faulty and based on a wrong analogy between the plastic arts and poetry rooted in the [[Horace|Horatian]] dictum [[ut pictura poesis]] ("as is painting so is poetry").

The British painter [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] in his ''Discourses'' of the 1770s and 1780s, reiterated the argument for still life to the lowest position in the hierarchy of genres on the grounds that it interfered with the painter's access to central forms, those products of the mind's generalising powers. At the summit reigned history painting, centred on the human body: familiarity with the forms of the body permitted the mind of the painter, by comparing innumerable instances of the human form, to abstract from it those typical or central features that represented the body's essence or ideal.

Though Reynolds agreed with FÃ©libien about the natural order of the genres, he held that an important work from any genre of painting could be produced under the hand of genius: "Whether it is the human figure, an animal, or even inanimate objects, there is nothing, however unpromising in appearance, but may be raised into dignity, convey sentiment, and produce emotion, in the hands of a painter of genius. What was said of [[Virgil]], that he threw even the dung about the ground with an air of dignity, may be applied to [[Titian]]; whatever he touched, however naturally mean, and habitually familiar, by a kind of magic he invested with grandeur and importance."

Though European academies usually strictly insisted on this hierarchy, over their reign, many artists were able to invent new genres which raised the lower subjects to the importance of history painting. Reynolds himself achieved this by inventing the portraiture style that was called the [[Grand Manner]], where he flattered his sitters by likening them to mythological characters. [[Jean-Antoine Watteau]] invented a genre that was called [[fÃªtes galantes]], where he would show scenes of courtly amusements taking place in Arcadian setting; these often had a poetic and allegorical quality which were considered to ennoble them. 

[[Claude Lorrain]] practised a genre called the [[ideal landscape]], where a composition would be loosely based on nature and dotted with classical ruins as a  setting for a biblical or historical theme. It artfully combined landscape and history painting, thereby legitimising the former. It is synonymous with the term ''historical landscape'' which received official recognition in the AcadÃ©mie franÃ§aise when a [[Prix de Rome]] for the genre was established in 1817. Finally, [[Jean-Baptiste-SimÃ©on Chardin]] was able to create still life paintings that were considered to have the charm and beauty as to be placed alongside the best allegorical subjects. However, aware of this hierarchy, Chardin began including figures in his work in about 1730, mainly women and children.

==19th century==
[[Romanticism]] greatly increased the status of landscape painting, beginning in [[British art]] and more gradually that of genre painting, which began to influence history painting in the anecdotal treatments of the [[Style Troubadour]] in France and equivalent trends elsewhere. Landscapes grew in size to reflect their new importance, often matching history paintings, especially in the American [[Hudson River School]] and Russian painting. Animal paintings also increased in size and dignity, but the full-length portrait, even of royalty, became mostly reserved for large public buildings.

Until the middle of the 19th century, [[women artists|women]] were largely unable to paint history paintings as they were not allowed to participate in the final process of artistic trainingâthat of life drawing, in order to protect their modesty. They could work from reliefs, prints, casts and from the Old Masters, but not from the nude model. Instead they were encouraged to participate in the lower painting forms such as portraiture, landscape and genre. These were considered more feminine in that they appealed to the eye rather than the mind.

Toward the end of the 19th century, painters and critics began to rebel against the many rules of the AcadÃ©mie franÃ§aise, including the status accorded to [[history painting]], which was beginning to be bought mainly by public bodies of one sort or another, as private buyers preferred subjects from lower down the hierarchy.  In Britain the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] movement tried to revitalize the history painting, with mixed success; other movements made similar efforts.  Many Pre-Raphaelites ended their careers mainly painting other subjects.  New artistic movements included the [[Realism (visual arts)|Realists]] and [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], which each sought to depict the present moment and daily life as observed by the eye, and unattatched from historical significance; the Realists often choosing genre painting and still life, while the Impressionists would most often focus on landscapes.

'''hprints''' ([[pronunciation|pronounced]] in [[English language|English]] as '''aitch prints''') is an [[archive]] for electronic [[preprint]]s of academic papers in the fields of [[humanities|arts and humanities]]. It can be accessed freely via the [[Internet]] since it is an [[open access]] [[repository (publishing)|repository]] aiming at making scholarly documents publicly available to the widest possible audience.

==The hprints project==
The aim of hprints is to make [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] research available through an open access online electronic full text archive, but the limitation to Nordic countries is claimed to be mainly an initial restriction for funding reasons. The archive will primarily contain electronic research documents in the form of preprints, reprints, working papers, book chapters, conference reports, invited lecture manuscripts etc. The archive is set up, maintained and promoted by [[Copenhagen University]] Library and consortium members. The consortium original members were:
* [[Copenhagen University]] Library, part of the [[Danish Royal Library]])
* The Faculty of Humanities, at [[Copenhagen University]]
* [[Lund University]] Library
* [[Museum Tusculanum Press]], an academic publisher
* [[University of Oslo]] Library
Submissions of electronic text material to the archive is decentral and take place at the local individual researcher, or research group level.

==Using hprints==
Hence hprints is a tool for scientific communication between academic scholars, who can upload full-text research material such as articles, papers, conference papers, book chapters etc. The content of the deposited material should be comparable to that of a scientific paper that a scholar would consider suitable for publication in for example a peer reviewed scientific journal.

It is possible to search and find the paper by defined topics through an Internet search. Secondly, all submitted papers are stored permanently and receive a stable web address, as for example the paper in this example:

 Pietism and the politics of catechisms
 HorstbÃ¸ll H.
 Scandinavian Journal of History 29, 2 (2004) p.&amp;nbsp;143-160
 http://www.hprints.org/hprints-00254947/en/

==History==
May 2007 the Nordic funding agency for libraries, [[Nordbib]], granted the hprints project 287,000 DKK as part of its financing programme ''Work Package 2: Focus area on Content and Accessibility''. The plan was to launch an archive one year from this date i.e. approximately June 2008: The hprints project wishes to provide a policy and a technical infrastructure that permits [[open access]] to research within the arts and humanities. The assumption was that this will result in a number of advantages with respect to the electronic accessibility and visibility of the arts and humanities research area.

October 2007, the Advisory Board of the [[Nordbib]] "hprints project" chose the system to be used for the Nordic arts and humanities e-print archive. Three possible alternatives existed: [[EPrints]] from the [[University of Southampton]], LUR from [[Lund University]] Libraries, and [[Hyper Articles en Ligne|HAL]] from the French national research council (CNRS). Both EPrints and LUR are free [[Open-source software|open source]] software that can be set up locally  or hosted commercially, while HAL is a functioning archive, to which portals can be set up.

At the hprints Advisory Board meeting in October, it was decided to collaborate with the French research council, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS). Hence, the hprints e-print archive for Nordic arts and humanities is set up as a [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] HAL portal with its own layout and adapted to the requirements of hprints.

March 2008 hprints opened for public access. Since the archive is a part of HAL and  papers will be shared with the French national archive.

The '''International Year of Biodiversity''' ('''IYB''') was a year-long celebration of [[biodiversity|biological diversity]] and its importance, taking place internationally in 2010. Coinciding with the date of the [[2010 Biodiversity Target]], the year was declared by the 61st session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 2006.

It was meant to help raise awareness of the importance of biodiversity through activities and events, to influence decision makers, and "to elevate biological diversity nearer to the top of the political agenda".&lt;ref&gt;Johns, David (2009). The International Year of BiodiversityâFrom Talk to Action. ''Conservation Biology'' 24 (1): 338â340.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The United Nations General Assembly declared 2010 as the International Year of Biodiversity (Resolution 61/203). This year coincided with the 2010 Biodiversity Target adopted by the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and by Heads of State and government at the World Summit for Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Marton-LefÃ¨vre, Julia (2010). Biodiversity is our life. ''Science'' 313: 1179. [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/327/5970/1179 abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Secretariat of the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD), based in [[Montreal]], [[Canada]], was coordinating the International Year of Biodiversity campaign.

Established at the [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1992, the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] is an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and the equitable sharing of the benefits of biodiversity. The CBD has near-universal participation, with 193 Parties.

==Main goals in UN view==
The main goals of the International Year of Biodiversity were to:
* Enhance public awareness of the importance of conserving biodiversity and of the underlying threats to biodiversity
* Raise awareness of the accomplishments to save biodiversity that had been realized by communities and governments
* Promote innovative solutions to reduce the threats to biodiversity
* Encourage individuals, organizations and governments to act immediately to halt [[biodiversity loss]]
* Start dialog between [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] for what to do in the post-2010 period

===Slogan===
::: '' Biodiversity is love. Biodiversity is life.''

==History==

During the course of the 17th century, three new types of Orthodox liturgical chant appeared in the [[Rus' (region)|Rus']] region. The first of them was the Kievan chant, followed by the so-called âBulgarianâ or Bulgarski chant, and finally the âGreekâ or Grecheski chant. They were collectively known by the term [[Obikhod]].&lt;ref name="unmercenary"&gt;Unmercenary Sacred Music: [http://www.unmercenary.com/chant/obchant.html Russian and Kievan Chant]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kievan chant first developed in the southwestern region of [[Rus' (region)|Rus']] (currently Eastern [[Ukraine]]) and then spread to [[Muscovite Russia]].&lt;ref name="motherofgod" /&gt; It was, in essence, a drastically simplified form of [[znamenny chant]].&lt;ref&gt;All Saints of Alaska Orthodox Church: [http://www.allsaintsofalaska.ca/index.php/the-orthodox-church/orthodox-music-chant Orthodox Music: Chant]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

Kievan chant melodies tend to be shorter and simpler rhythmically than znamenny melodies; there are more pronounced distinctions between [[recitative]]-like and [[melisma]]tic passages; and certain phrases of text are repeated, something that generally does not occur in the [[znamenny chant]].&lt;ref name="motherofgod" /&gt;

The melodies of Kievan chant, for the most part, served as the basis for the so-called "Common" chant.&lt;ref name="motherofgod"&gt;Church "Mother of God": [http://churchmotherofgod.org/orthodox-terminology/glossary-k/886-kievan-chant.html Kievan chant]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016''' is an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]] which continues the process of [[land reform in Scotland]] following the [[Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015]]. It is notable for granting [[Scottish ministers]] the power to force the sale of private land to community bodies to further [[sustainable development]] in the absence of a willing seller.

==Provisions==

Under the provisions of the act there is to be a âLand Rights and Responsibilities Statementâ, setting out the Scottish Governmentâs objectives for [[Land reform in Scotland|land reform]], a [[Scottish Land Commission]] is to take forward the land reform process, preparing a strategic plan, for the approval of Scottish ministers. One of the new land commissioners is to be a Tenant Farming Commissioner who must be neither an agricultural landlord nor a tenant but who is to be responsible for reviewing issues relating to [[tenant farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blair|first1=Mike|title=A Brief Guide to Land Reform in Scotland|url=http://www.gillespiemacandrew.co.uk/media/340813/land-reform-act-2016.pdf|publisher=Gillespie Macandrew LLP|accessdate=5 March 2017|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further provision is the creation of the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development. This permits Scottish ministers to approve the purchase of privately owned land by a community body with a registered interest. Unlike the Community Right to Buy established by the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]] and extended by the [[Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015]], the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development does not require a willing seller but allows ministers to compel landowners to sell if they decide that the sale will further sustainable development in the area. In this respect it is similar to the Crofting Community Right to Buy of the 2003 Act which allows [[crofting]] communities to purchase croft land and the Community Right to Buy abandoned or derelict land of the 2015 Act, neither of which require a willing seller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community rights to buy in Scotland â which is which, and what are they for?|url=http://www.brodies.com/node/8185|website=Brodies|accessdate=5 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community bodies may also register an interest in allowing a 3rd party to purchase land on the same basis. 

Other provisions of the act include new regulations to require persons who control land to be identified, with information obtained to appear in the Land Register of Scotland; the removal of sporting rights exemption from rates, which are to be re-valued; and further powers for [[Scottish Natural Heritage]] to control deer management. It also makes provision for notice and consultation where core paths are to be amended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2016/18/pdfs/asp_20160018_en.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Serpentine lines from William Hogarth's The Analysis of Beauty.jpg|thumbnail|right|Serpentine lines from Hogarth's ''The Analysis of Beauty'']]

'''Line of beauty''' is a term and a theory in [[art]] or [[aesthetics]] used to describe an S-shaped curved line (a [[serpentine shape|serpentine]] line) appearing within an object, as the boundary line of an object, or as a virtual boundary line formed by the composition of several objects. This theory originated with [[William Hogarth]] (18th-century English painter, satirist, and writer), and is an essential part of Hogarth's theory of aesthetics as described in his ''[[Analysis of Beauty]]'' (1753). According to this theory, S-shaped curved lines signify liveliness and activity and excite the attention of the viewer as contrasted with straight lines, parallel lines, or right-angled intersecting lines, which signify stasis, death, or inanimate objects.

In contrast to grand compositional lines, which are regularly found in [[Baroque]] or [[Rococo]] art, the serpentine line is not primarily dictating the whole composition of a canvas. Instead, the line should be understood as being found in parts; a composition is created by employing various kinds of lines in various relations to each other without destroying its simplicity.

This incomplete '''list of art critics''' enumerates persons who had or have a significant part of their known creative output in the form of [[art criticism]], which consists mostly of the written discussion and aesthetic evaluation of [[Work of art|works of art]].&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;
{{Compact ToC|seealso=yes|q=}}

==Scope==
{{main|Art critic}}
There is no official list of [[art critic]]s, the compilation of which is compounded by problems in defining [[art criticism]] â not least of which is the overlap with [[art history]],&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; and [[Aesthetics|philosophy of art]]. Herein will be included those [[authors]] that are mentioned as being art critics or producing art criticism in works of reference, as are encyclopedias, dictionaries or scholarly reviews.

According to one authority, art criticism, in a close approximation to the current sociocultural framework of the activity, started in the [[18th century CE]] in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; However, many authors living before that time and outside that region of the world wrote on the subject of art and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic experience]], though using [[Philosophy of art|terms and concepts]] that may not have a direct translation into the lexicon of the [[Western culture|Western]] tradition.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; These, when mentioned, will be included as well though pertinently noted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10001">'''Lived religion''' is the [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] and [[Holism|holistic]] framework for understanding the beliefs, practices, and everyday experiences of religious and spiritual persons in [[religious studies]]. The name lived religion comes from the French tradition of [[sociology of religion]] "la religion vÃ©cue."&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "Lived Religion In America: Toward A History Of Practice", Princeton University Press (1997), p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of lived religion was popularized in the late 20th century by religious study scholars like [[Robert A. Orsi]] and [[David D. Hall]]. The study of lived religion has come to include a wide range of subject areas as a means of exploring and emphasizing what a religious person does and what they believe. Today, the field of lived religion is expanding to include many topics and scholars.

==Scholars==

===Robert Orsi===
[[Robert A. Orsi]] is Professor of Religious Studies and History and Grace Craddock Nagle Chair in Catholic Studies at [[Northwestern University]]. He researches, writes, and teaches about religion in the United States, in the past and in contemporary contexts, with a particular focus on American Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.weinberg.northwestern.edu/orsi/&lt;/ref&gt; Orsiâs book ''The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950'', won several prizes including the Jesuit National Book Award and is an example study of lived religion.

Orsi defines lived religion as including âthe work of social agents/actors themselves as narrators and interpreters (and reinterpreters) of their own experiences and histories, recognizing that the stories we tell about others exist alongside the many and varied story they tell of them selvesâ.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxix&lt;/ref&gt; Orsi understands lived religion to be centered on the actions and interpretations of religious person.

In order to study and write about lived religion Orsi suggests a broad field of study in terms of topic matter and methodology. Orsi describes his own process of studying lived religion for ''Madonna On 115th Street'' as wide in scope: âI came to realize that I was learning as much from how people were to me as from what they were telling me, as much as what was going on around the stories as from the stories themselves.â &lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxix&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a narrow archival study, Orsiâs focus on non-traditional forms of research demands that scholars give attention to institutions ''and'' persons, texts ''and'' rituals, practices ''and'' theology, things and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxvii&lt;/ref&gt; In order to study lived religion, Orsi advocates for a complex academic lens where almost anything can hold meaning and serve as a source or text for study.   [[File:La Madonna col Bambino.JPG|thumb|La Madonna col Bambino]]

In ''The Madonna Of 115th Street'', Orsi studies the lived religion of Catholic Italian immigrants in [[Harlem]] New York. Orsi focuses on a particular religious celebration known as the [[Feast day|festa]] for [[The Madonna]] and the social structures that create and layer the event. Through observations, story telling, conversations and research Orsi weaves a picture of life for this immigrant community. In his book, Orsi explores and explains various internal traditions, cultures, and power and social dynamicss in order to illustrate the various religious meanings and significance for community in Italian Harlem.

Orsi talks about the importance of dynamic subject matter covered by the study of lived religion: âthe study of lived religion is shaped by and shapes the way family life is organized, for instance; how the dead are buried, children disciplined, the past and present imagined, moral boundaries established and challenged, home constructed, maintained and destroyed, the gods and spirits worshiped and importuned and so onâ.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orsi's critique of popular religion===

Orsi critiques popular religion as being a limited framework and method for studying religion. Orsi claims that popular religion is âunclear, misleading, and tendentiousâ.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt; Orsi notes that popular religion is concerned only with the practices of âcommon folkâ and distinguishing popular religion practices as separate from âofficial religionâ.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt; In his introduction to The Madonna on 115th Street, he writes, âpopular religion served to seal off certain expressions of religious life from unspecified but obviously normative religionâ.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt; Orsi is concerned with the limitations of popular religions because he sees it as potentially authorizing legitimacy and boundaries in religious practices and beliefs. For Orsi, the implied intent in popular religion is to highlight the primitive, ignorant, and often marginalized practitioners of popular religion as a means of âpolicing religionâ.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxiv&lt;/ref&gt; Orsiâs scholarly move to lived religion as a theoretical framework was an attempt to provide a more holistic approach to religious studies and also highlights the perspective that âreligious practices and understandings only have meaning in relations to other cultural forms and in relations to the life experiences and actual circumstance of the people using themâ.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Orsi, "The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950", Yale University Press (2002), p. xxxviii&lt;/ref&gt;

===David D. Hall===
[[David D. Hall]] has been a faculty member at [[Harvard Divinity School]] since 1989. Hall was Bartlett Professor of New England Church History until 2008, when he became Bartlett Research Professor.&lt;ref&gt;http://hds.harvard.edu/people/david-d-hall&lt;/ref&gt; Hall writes extensively on religion and society in seventeenth-century New England and England. Hall edited a series of essays titled ''Lived Religion In America: Toward a History Of Practice'', which is a foundational compilation in the study of lived religion. Hallâs book covers topics including gift exchange, cremation, hymn singing and many other essays on lived and practiced religious belief. Many of Hall's students have gone on to become notable scholars in the field of lived religion.

Hall defines lived religion as ârooted less in sociology than cultural and ethnographical approaches to the study of religion and American religious history.â&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "Lived Religion In America: Toward A History Of Practice", Princeton University Press (1997), p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;   He instead sees lived religion as the study of the context and content about the practices of religious laity and their âeveryday thinking.â&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "Lived Religion In America: Toward A History Of Practice", Princeton University Press (1997), p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;  Hall believes that using lived religion as an approach to the study of religion allows for a wider interpretation of meaning and also provides an opportunity for historians to examine the past and present from many angles. For Hall, lived religion âdoes not depend on any single method or discipline.â&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "Lived Religion In America: Toward A History Of Practice", Princeton University Press (1997), p. x&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall also acknowledges the limitations of lived religion. Hall suggests that as a field, lived religion is âfluid, mobile, and incompletely structured.â&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "Lived Religion In America: Toward A History Of Practice", Princeton University Press (1997), p. xii,quoting DaniÃ¨le Hervieu-LÃ©ger&lt;/ref&gt;  Hall calls lived religion an âimperfect toolâ noting that even with a dynamic study of laity it is impossible to fully understand any one personâs religious practices, especially when summarizing from a single location be it time or place.

===Hall's critique of popular religion===
Hall distinguishes the study of lived religion from popular religion by saying that popular religion is concerned with hierarchy and opposition in religious beliefs and practices. Hall writes, âpopular religion has therefore come to signify the space that emerged between official or learned Christianity and the profane (or âpaganâ) culture.â&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "Lived Religion In America: Toward A History Of Practice", Princeton University Press (1997), p. viii&lt;/ref&gt;  Hall critiques popular religion as imposing normative perspectives on practices.

'''Manuscript culture''' uses [[manuscript]]s to store and disseminate information; in the West, it generally preceded the age of [[printing]]. In early manuscript culture, monks copied manuscripts by hand. They copied not just religious works, but a variety of texts including some on astronomy, [[herbals]], and [[bestiaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voigts|first=Linda|title=Anglo-Saxon Plant Remedies and the Anglo Saxons|journal=Isis|date=June 1, 1979|volume=70|issue=2|page=251|doi=10.1086/352199}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Medieval manuscript culture deals with the transition of the manuscript from the monasteries to the market in the cities, and the rise of universities. Manuscript culture in the cities created jobs built around the making and trade of manuscripts, and typically was regulated by universities. Late manuscript culture was characterized by a desire for uniformity, well-ordered and convenient access to the text contained in the manuscript, and ease of reading aloud. This culture grew out of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] (1215) and the rise of the [[Devotio Moderna]]. It included a change in materials (switching from vellum to paper), and was subject to remediation by the printed book, while also influencing it.

== Medieval manuscript culture ==

=== Beginnings ===
[[File:ÙØ®Ø·ÙØ·Ø§Øª Ø¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ© ÙØ¯ÙÙØ©.jpg|thumb|Arabic Manuscripts from the 18th century]]
Manuscript culture seems to have really begun around the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voigts|first=Linda|title=Anglo-Saxon Plant Remedies and the Anglo-Saxons|journal=Isis|date=June 1, 1979|volume=70|issue=2|pages=250â268|doi=10.1086/352199}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to say however, that manuscripts and the recording of information was not important prior to the 10th century, but that during the 10th century, historians see an influx and heavier weight placed on these manuscripts. This was a time when medical practitioners were advancing what they knew about the human body and the way that certain substances interacted with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=Science in the Middle Ages|date=1980|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-48233-2|pages=432â433}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These medical practitioners recorded this information and passed it on through the means of literate people. Catholic [[monasteries]] and [[cathedrals]] during the Middle Ages were centers of learning (see [[cathedral schools]]), so it would only make sense for these texts to end up in the hands of the monks.

These monks would meticulously record the information presented in the texts, but not mindlessly. In the case of herbals, for instance, there is evidence that the monks improved upon some texts, retracted textual errors, and made the text particularly relevant to the area in which they lived. Some monasteries even went so far as to grow some of the plants included in the texts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voigts|first=Linda|title=Anglo-Saxon Plant Remedies and Anglo Saxons|journal=Isis|date=June 1, 1979|volume=70|issue=2|pages=250â252|doi=10.1086/352199}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was due in part to their intimate understanding of their local herbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=The Beginnings of Western Science|first=Lindberg|title=David|date=2007|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important to note because it demonstrated the practical uses of these text in the lives of the monks. They had little room, or patience for that matter, to disseminate the imaginary plants and fanciful texts that are so commonly imagined in the minds of those who think of this era. The writers truly restricted themselves to only include practical information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=Science in the Middle Ages|date=1978|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=430â431}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a time when plants and botany was linked very closely with medicine and [[herbal remedies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=The Beginnings of Western Science|date=2007|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of bestiaries, similarly to herbals, the monks generally copied and cited previous texts to pass them on. Unlike the herbals, the monks could not grow an animal in their garden, so largely the information taken from the bestiaries was taken at face value. The consequence of this is that the writers were free to elaborate and embellish upon texts. This was a definite and deliberate attempt to give the animal in question a certain moral or allegorical meaning beyond the physical appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=Science in the Middle Ages|date=1978|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=432â433}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bestiary texts can be very like traditional mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=The Beginnings of Western Science|date=2007|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=354â355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trade ===
In the 13th century, [[Paris]] was the first city to have a large commercial trade of manuscripts, with manuscript-book producers being commissioned to make specific books for specific people. Paris had a large enough population of wealthy literate persons to support the livelihood of people producing manuscripts. This medieval era marks the shift in manuscript production from monks in monasteries to booksellers and scribes making a living from their work in the cities.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Nicolas, and British Library. ''A Potencie of Life : Books in Society : The Clark Lectures 1986â1987, British Library Studies in the History of the Book.'' London: British Library, 1993. p. 45-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flourished initial "L" from a medieval manuscript.jpeg|thumb|left|Flourished initial L&lt;ref&gt;http://wally.rit.edu/cary/cc_db/manuscripts/43a.jpeg&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Individuals did scribal work, but collaboration has been suggested.  Commercial [[workshops]] or ateliers operated out of Paris during this time, often collaborating on jobs.  Research from FranÃ§ois Avril, Joan Diamond and others has confirmed that two or more [[artists]] alternated, or otherwise shared, in the illumination of a single manuscript; however, the detailed logistics of this work remain unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, 1993 p.46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most medieval [[scribes]] gathered together as they copied, but some separated books into sections to copy them in parts.  Previously in the monasteries, work was broken up between scribes and [[Limner|illuminators]]; examples exist where the scribe would leave space for and write out a small cursive letter at the beginning of a new paragraph, which was then painted in at a later time by the illuminator.&lt;ref&gt;de Hamel, Christopher. ''The British Library Guide to Manuscript Illumination: History and Techniques.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press. 1988. p. 41-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pecia system ===

The pecia system was developed in [[Italy|Italian]] university cities by the beginning of the thirteenth century and became a regulated procedure at the [[University of Paris]] in the second half of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, Richard H., and Mary A. Rouse. ''Manuscripts and Their Makers : Commercial Book Producers in Medieval Paris'', 1200â1500. 2 vols, Illiterati Et Uxorati. Turnhout, Belgium: Harvey Miller, 2000. p.85.&lt;/ref&gt; The pecia system broke up the book into sections called peciae.  Individuals â such as students â would rent them, section by section, to copy.  The peciae were generally four folios long which allowed for a fast turn-over rate for each pecia for students to exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, B. L., "La Pecia dans les manuscrits universitaires du XIII  e et du XIV  e siecle." Rev. of La Pecia, by Jean Destrez. ''Classical Philology'', Vol. 33, No. 2. Apr. 1938: pp. 238-240.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this system, a larger number of copiers, working simultaneously, could produce a copy in a significantly shorter amount of time than a single person working alone.

[[File:c7463-01a.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of pecia mark&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/ILLUMIN.ASP?Size=mid&amp;IllID=13853|title=Image of an item from the British Library Catalogue of Illuminated Manuscripts|first=C|last=Wight|date=|website=www.bl.uk|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The original collection of peciae for a book from which all future copies will be based is called the exemplar.  The process of making an exemplar was supposed to be an orderly procedure: Masters of the university who compiled a new work were to edit, correct, and submit this authentic text to a stationer; he in turn copied from it an exemplar in peciae, corrected these against the [[author| authorâs]] text with utmost care, and finally submitted them to the inspection of the universityâs delegates for approval and for the setting of a rental price. Only then were peciae available for rental and copy.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, Mary A., and Richard H. Rouse. ''Authentic Witnesses : Approaches to Medieval Texts and Manuscripts'', Publications in Medieval Studies ; 17 Notre Dame, Ind.: University of Notre Dame Press, 1991. p.303.&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality, it came down to the [[stationer]] â part of whose job was renting out peciae â finding and offering for rental the works which he thought would be demanded. This pressure on the stationers prompted them to acquire exemplars in as good a state and in as short a time as possible. The emphasis was on speed of acquisition instead of the quality of the product. If a certain work seemed likely to become a âbest seller,â a stationer would make a copy of the best text immediately available, and would have his exemplar-peciae corrected as well as time permitted. At times, the stationer sought the text; at other times, it was the author who offered his newly completed work to the stationer, but it was never the university as a formal body which made requests or developed what was to be offered.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p.304-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Booksellers in Paris ===
[[Philip IV of France|King Philip the Fair of France]], 1285â1314, instituted a .4% commercial [[tax]] on all goods.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, 1993 p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1307 the King exempted all the ''librarii universitatis'' from paying the commercial tax, the taille. This exemption privileged the French universities over the booksellers because if they did not swear the oath they would not be exempt from the tax.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p.272.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scriptorium - 15th Century - Project Gutenberg eText 16531.jpg|thumb|left| Paul Pierce within an illustration of a MediÃ¦val Scriptorium. From a manuscript of a Book of Prayers. 15th Century. British Museum, Slo. 2468.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Benham]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/16531 ''Old St. Paul's Cathedral'' - Project Gutenberg]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''Librarius'' is a general term while ''stationarius'' refers to one specific kind of librarius. ''Librarius'' can mean anything from scribe to bookseller to [[librarian]]. ''Stationarius'' or stationer refers to those types of ''librarius'' who rented out peciae. Both types, however, were involved in the secondhand trade, produced new books, and were regulated by the university.  The sole distinction between them was the stationer's added service of renting out pecia.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p.261-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Restrictions ====

The oaths that the ''librarii'' or booksellers had to swear to the [[university|universities]] to obey their regulations and requirements for the tax exemption were extremely restrictive in regard to the resale of secondhand books. They were supposed to act more like intermediaries between the seller and the buyer while their profit was limited to essentially four pence per pound. They were further required to display the secondhand books prominently in their shops, give a professional assessment of the likely price of the books submitted to them, and put would-be buyers in direct contact with the seller.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p.270.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bookseller had to swear not to underpay when buying and not to overcharge when selling. The stationers rented out copies of useful texts, one [[Paper quire|quire]] at a time, so students and masters could make their own copies. Both fees were regulated by the university.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, 1993 p.52-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Both kinds of booksellers had to guarantee their compliance to their oath by posting a bond of 100 [[pence]].&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 2000 p.77.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:irwin1.jpg|thumb|right|A monk inspecting a sheet of parchment
which he is buying from a parchment-maker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hortulus.net/may06lf/irwin.html|title=Hortulus: The Online Graduate Journal of Medieval Studies|author=|date=|website=hortulus.net|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
It was not just the booksellers which the universities regulated. Additionally, university regulations forbade parchmenters from hiding the good [[parchment]] from university members wanting to buy. There were plenty of other demands for parchment outside the university such as: the record-keeping for the royal government, every similar entity of a commercial or mercantile [[guild]], every religious house that issued a [[charter]] or kept a rent roll, every public letter-writer, everyone from major international trader to local shop-keeper who kept accounts. They all demanded parchment in greater numbers and were willing to pay higher than the regulated price which the university members paid. And so, the universities feeling such pressures often chose to regulate parchment as well.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 2000 p.80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Benefits ====

While there were many restrictions on the bookseller, the job did have its benefits. The bookseller was free to produce and sell books, illuminate, or write for anyone they pleased like the Court, cathedral, or the wealthy [[laymen]] of the [[Capital (political)|capital]] and [[provinces]] so long as they met their obligations to the university to which they had sworn oaths. In fact, most of their trade fell outside of the university regulation. There is an important distinction between the regulation of how books were traded within the university and how the booksellers were able to charge whatever the open market would bear. To the non-student or masters, there were no such restrictions on the booksellers.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p.269.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1300â1500, the position of libraire was a closed position only open upon the resignation or death of a previous one. Aside from cheap books, it was only the libraire who was allowed to sell books in Paris. The university essentially guaranteed a monopoly on the sale of books for booksellers.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 2000 p.78.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Late Manuscript Culture ==

===Characteristics===
[[File:Escribano.jpg|thumb|An author portrait of [[Jean MiÃ©lot]] writing his compilation of the ''Miracles of Our Lady'', one of his many popular works.]]
The period of "Late Manuscript Culture" dates from roughly the mid-fourteenth century to the fifteenth century, preceding and existing alongside the printing press.  While embodying all of the ideals and adhering to the regulations observable in the [[Devotio Moderna]], there are many clear characteristics of Late Manuscript Culture.  For instance, careful attention was paid to the punctuation and layout of texts, with readability and specifically reading aloud taking preeminence. Meaning had to be clear in every sentence, with as little room left to interpretation as possible (compared to the lack of spaces in text and any markings for the purpose of aiding in enunciation), due to preachings' rise in popularity after the [[Fourth Lateran Council]].  Correct [[orthography]] was attempted whenever the necessary exemplars made it possible to emend earlier texts, especially Bibles, and this correction made many texts uniform.  In this period of Manuscript Culture, the emendatiora, manuscripts which combined surviving texts of the oldest available exemplars with the manuscripts that had been currently acceptable and prominent, were created.&lt;ref&gt;
Rouse, Mary A., and Richard H. Rouse. Authentic Witnesses : Approaches to Medieval Texts and Manuscripts, Publications in Medieval Studies ; 17, p. 447-457.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aids to find one's way about the text are prominent features in these manuscripts.  While none were invented solely in fifteenth century, they were used with increasing frequency and became more complex. These include:

* tables of contents
* lists of chapters, either at the beginning of each book or gathered at the beginning of the whole work (if it is a collection of works)
* running headlines
* extensively detailed [[Colophon (publishing)|colophons]]
* page numbers in [[Arabic numerals]].
* the appearance of subject indexes&lt;ref&gt;Hellinga, Lotte.  The Codex in the Fifteenth Century. Manuscript and Print. Barker, Nicolas, ed. and British Library. A Potencie of Life : Books in Society : The Clark Lectures 1986â1987, British Library Studies in the History of the Book. London: British Library, 1993. p. 63-84. Rouse, 1991. p. 452-459.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other changes included the enlargement of the [[rubric]] from one to two lines in the university manuscript to eight or ten, and the distinction of it by separate letter-form.  The rubric also changed in regard to the categories of information included in it. An earlier rubric might have contained a title of the particular section or article, and a description of the ending of the preceding one.  A fifteenth century rubric would add information about the translator or translators, and the original writer if they were not particularly well known. A brief description of their content, or even detailed information considering the date or conditions of the works creation is also occasionally seen, though not as frequently. These changes exemplify the desire for uniformity, ease of access, and strict regulation of a given work and its subsequent correction.  These are many of the same goals attributed to the uniformity exemplified by the printing press.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p. 452-457&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production of manuscripts at the beginning of the fifteenth century ===

The emergence of new standards in manuscript production, beginning in the [[Low Countries]] at the end of the fourteenth century, clearly marked the beginning of a new epoch in manuscript culture. Uniformity would result from the desire for clarity, both in terms of bibliographic accuracy and the reproduction and correction of the text itself.  It necessitated greater organization, specifically within the monastic [[scriptoria]].  These had lost pre-eminence in medieval manuscript culture, characterized by the university, but had begun to undergo a rebirth in the fourteenth century.  Historians have characterized this period as chaotic, with very poor quality paper manuscripts being held as a standard.  However, the varying quality of materials did not affect the quality of the text contained on it, as the transition was made from parchment to rag paper. For instance, there was the formation of a new script, called hybrida, that sought to combine the traditional cursiva script with the script used in printed books.  There was little loss of legibility, due to the use of sharp angles instead of loops.  Additionally, in the first half of the fifteenth century, the practice of using a hierarchy of scripts to demarcate different sections of a text was re-instituted.  Rubrics and colophons were clearly set off from the remainder of a text, employing their own unique script.  All of these changes resulted from a desire for improved accuracy, and led to the creation of complex codification rules.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 450-452&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uniformity amidst variety ===

Many manuscripts were produced that had differences in terms of size, layout, script, and illumination.  They were based on the same text while being created by many different scribes.  Yet, they were meticulously corrected, to the point that very few differences in terms of the text itself can be observed among them.  This implied not only the presence of a direct authority that maintained some sort of direction over the scribes, but also a newfound pursuit of scholarly accuracy that had not been present with the university book sellers. It was emphasized by the new religious orders that had been created in the fourteenth century.  Correction and emendation would be held in the same esteem as copying itself.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 427-440&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Codification rules and the Opus Pacis ===

Written in 1428 by the German [[Carthusian]], Oswald de Corda, prior of the Grand Chartreuse, the Opus Pacis consisted of two parts.  One dealt primarily with orthography and accent, where Oswald stated that his motive in creating these codification rules was to dispel the anxiety of his fellow [[Carthusians]].  Many members of the order were worried about the omission of single letters, not just phrases, words or syllables within copies of a given text (demonstrating the new concern for uniformity taken to an extreme).  It is clear that his audience was composed of [[scribes]], specifically those meticulous to âthe verge of neurosisâ.  He seeks to reinforce the importance of older statutes regarding manuscript production, such as the Carthusian statutes, and the way in which he seeks to correct them.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, 450-457&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Statuta Nova of 1368 ====

Oswald specifically wanted to reform the Statuta Nova of 1368. It stated no one could emend copies of the Old and New Testament, unless they were doing so against exemplars that had been prescribed by their order.  Anyone who corrected texts in a manner inconsistent with those exemplars was publicly acknowledged to have corrupted the text, and subsequently punished.  Oswald answered this with his Work of Peace, and stated that correctors should not engage in pointless labor by over-correcting.  In it, he described correction not as a command, but an indulgence. It was practiced for the improvement and glorification of a text, and though it followed a set of rules, they were not so strict as to stifle emendation.  This was a transition from older works with large amounts of lists and regulations that mandated every action a scribe could take in correction, and had been widely ignored in medieval print culture.  Oswald rejected a system in which one must simply pick a single exemplar and correct according to it, or reproduce portions of texts which the scribe knew to be in error due to a proper exemplar not being attainable. Before Oswald, many believed these were the only available options under the older, strict rules.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 440-452&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New rules of corrections ====

Oswald specifically made sure to outline the proper way of correcting various readings of the same text, as observed in varying exemplars.  He stated that scribes shouldn't instantly correct according to one or the other, but deliberate, and use proper judgment.  Oswald also said that in the case of bibles, scribes should not immediately modernize archaic spellings, because this had produced further variation within texts. Oswald also detailed a uniform set of abbreviations. However, he stated that scribes should recognize national differences, particularly in light of the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]].  Scribes were right to correct texts with different dialects of [[Latin]], especially if they were using archaic forms of Latin verbs, however.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hist.msu.ru/Departments/Medieval/Cappelli/ Rouse 1991, p. 440-452&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Valde Bonum ====

In his prologue to the Opus Pacis, Oswald contrasts his work with the Valde Bonum,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmml.org/research06/catalogue/detail.asp?MSID=76416 A 14th/15th century, German Valde Bonum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213323/http://www.hmml.org/research06/catalogue/detail.asp?MSID=76416 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an earlier handbook compiled during the Great Schism.  It had attempted to set forth universal spellings for the [[Bible]], and stated that the corrector need not emend to conform to an exemplar from a given region based on its perceived superiority, but could rather take local regional practice as a standard.  It acknowledged that centuries of use, and transmission from nation to nation, had an effect on various spellings.  He incorporated many of these elements into his Opus Pacis, which was copied and put to practical use, and had spread from [[Germany]] as far north as [[Ireland]].  By the 1480s, it had become a standard, specifically for the Devotio Moderna and the Reformed [[Benedictines]]. Opus Pacis became a generic term for any work of its kind.  The last surviving copy was written in 1514, indicating that manuscript correction remained an important subject sixty years into the printed era.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 440-448&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manuscript as a vehicle for preaching ===

It was in Late Manuscript Culture that the written page took on a renewed meaning to religious communities.  Scriptorias of Benedictine, Cisterican and Augustinaian houses had resumed after being suppressed by the production of university and mendicant books.  Particularly, these scriptoria exemplified the idea that one shall live by the fruit of one's labors.  Writing sacred books was the most fitting, suitable and pious task that one could undertake to do so.  Also, copying these books was equivalent to preaching with ones hands.  Sermons were only of moderate importance in the 13th century. By the 15th century, after the emphasis placed on preaching in the Fourth Lateran Council, they were of the utmost importance.  The formation and expansion of preaching orders led to the proliferation of pastoral theology in schools, and preaching was now an indispensable part of the sacraments.  Uniform manuscripts with many tools made for ease of reference, reading, and enunciation became necessary.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 452-456&lt;/ref&gt;

The Devotio Moderna and the reformed Benedictines relied on reading devotional texts for instruction, and the written word was raised to a high level of importance not afforded by earlier religious movements.   The writing was just as important as the word.  In fact, monasteries bought many printed books, becoming the main market for the early printing press, precisely because of this devotion to preaching.  Without the Devotio Moderna and orders that followed their example, the need for texts and printers would not have been present. Printing had exploded in [[Germany]] and the Low Countries, the home of the Devotio Moderna and Reformed Benedictines, as opposed to [[England]] and [[France]]. They were also the home to the beginnings of Late Manuscript Culture, because of the common desire for uniformity. Trimethius protested the invasion of the [[library]] by the printed book because of the missing aspect of devotion that had been present in preaching with ones' hands.  With the preaching possible as a scribe, manuscripts had a function that was lacking in a printed book, though both possessed a greater degree of uniformity than earlier manuscripts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=== Manuscripts and the arrival of print ===

By roughly 1470, the transition from [[Penmanship|handwritten]] books to printed ones had begun.  The book trade, in particular, underwent drastic changes.  By this point German printing presses had reached the northernmost regions of [[Europe]], specifically Paris.  By 1500, print had stopped imitating manuscripts and manuscripts were imitating print.  In the reign of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (1515â1547) for instance, the king's handwritten manuscripts were based on Roman type.  While quality rag paper had appeared before the arrival of the printing press, it was at this time that parchmenters lost most of their business.  Paper was not only acceptable, it was preferable, and printers and scribes had both ceased to use parchment altogether.  Many libraries decried these changes, because of the loss in individuality and subtlety that resulted.&lt;ref&gt;Lotte, p. 63â81 Rouse, Richard H., and Mary A. Rouse. ''Manuscripts and Their Makers : Commercial Book Producers in Medieval Paris, 1200â1500''. 2 vols, Illiterati Et Uxorati. Turnhout, Belgium: Harvey Miller, 2000. p. 328-329&lt;/ref&gt; Many printed books and manuscripts were even created with the same paper.  The same watermarks are often observable on them, that signified the particular paper dealer who created it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ksbm.oeaw.ac.at/_scripts/php/wzma.php wzma.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611161722/http://www2.ksbm.oeaw.ac.at/_scripts/php/wzma.php |date=11 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuscripts were still written and illuminated well into the sixteenth century, some dating to just before 1600.  Many illuminators continued to work on various manuscripts, specifically the [[Book of Hours]].  The Book of Hours had been the most commonly produced manuscript from the 1450s onward, and was among the last manuscripts created.  By the sixteenth century, however, manuscripts were mostly illuminated by artists retained by nobles or royals.  Their work was required (and manuscripts were created) only for unusual occasions, such as noble or royal births, weddings, or other extraordinary occurrences.  The number of copyists had greatly declined, as these types of manuscripts were not intended for mass, or even student, consumption.&lt;ref&gt;''Hellinga, Lotte. p. 63-79'' Rouse 2000, p. 329-331&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional organization of book production fell apart; they were made up of libraries doling out quires to scribes and illuminators, who lived in proximity.  The new, specialized system based on patronage didn't support them.  Libraries, and not scribes, turned into printers, and served as a link between late manuscript culture and print culture.  They had possessed reserves of manuscripts, and slowly supplemented them with printed books, until printed books dominated their collections. However, the cost and risks involved in making books greatly increased with the transition to print. Still, Paris and more northern areas of Europe (especially France) had been the foremost center of manuscript production, and remained a force in the printed book market, falling only behind Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Hellinga, Lotte. p. 63-72 Rouse 2000, p. 329â332&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Manuscript descent and exemplars ====

There were accounts{{By whom|date=February 2011}} of scribes working in a similar manner in comparison to their rival printers, though the process was still subtly different.  The pages on sheets of vellum were folded together to form a quire before the invention of printing or paper, and printed books also bound multiple quires to form a codex. They were simply made of paper.  Manuscripts were also used as exemplars for printed books. Lines were counted off based on the exemplar and marked in advance, while the typesetting reflected the layout of the manuscript's text.  Within a few generations, however, printed books were used as new exemplars. This process created various âfamily treesâ, as many printed sources would be double checked against earlier manuscripts if the quality was deemed too low.  This necessitated the creation of stemma, or lines of descent among books. This made manuscripts gain a new significance, as sources to find earlier authority or a better authority, in comparison to the published version of a text.  [[Erasmus]], for instance, attained authoritative manuscripts from the medieval period due to his dissatisfaction with printed Bibles.

=== Christine de Pizan and humanist illumination ===

The Epistre Othea or Letter of Othea to Hector,  composed in 1400, symbolized the murky transition from manuscript culture to the Renaissance and humanistic print culture.  It was a retelling of the classical story of Othea through an illuminated manuscript, though it conveyed many humanistic Renaissance ideas.  Created by [[Christine de Pizan]], its patron was Louis of Orleans, heir to the French throne.  It contained over 100 images, and each chapter opened with the image of a mythological figure or event.  It also contained short narrative verses, and text addressed to Hector.  Each prose passage contained a labeled gloss, and attempted to interpret a humanistic lesson from the myth.  Every gloss closed with a quote from an ancient philosopher.  Additionally, other short prose passages called allegories concluded a section. They conveyed lessons applicable to the soul, and a Latin Bible quotation.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond, Marilynn and Pamela Sheingorn. Myth, montage, &amp; visuality in late medieval manuscript culture : Christine de Pizanâs Epistre Othea. Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2003. p. 1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Christine de Pizan combined contemporary images through illumination with new humanistic values typically associated with print.  Her work was based on [[Ovid]]'s, and many Ovidian myths were traditionally illuminated, in the medieval period.  She also incorporated astrology, Latin texts, and a wide variety of classical mythology in fleshing out Ovid's account, maintaining her humanist motivations.  This contradiction also led to the use of illuminatio, or the practice of using light as color.  Her Othea is a [[bricolage]], restructuring tradition while not trying to create a new master work.  It was done in the style of an ordinatio, or layout that emphasized the meaning of the organization of images.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond and Sheingorn, p.1-192&lt;/ref&gt;

The Othea reflected a late manuscript culture that was defined by violence, action, and gender challenges within literature. Anger was depicted in relation to gender, and marked âa departure from the Aristotelian traditionâ.   Women were no longer driven into mindless frenzies, but possessed anger that developed from fully considered character interactions.  The Epistre Othea remained Christine's most popular work, despite the fact that multiple versions existed.  Because of the fluid nature of manuscript reproduction, specifically in the case of illumination (as opposed to the text), the visual experience was not uniform. Each exemplar incorporated diverse cultural elements, with many having entirely different philosophical and theological implications.  Only later reproductions that used woodcuts to reproduce the images created a truly authorial version of the manuscript.  It also owed its  very existence to the printing press in the first instance, because bibles were now relegated to the press, leaving nonreligious texts available for detailed illumination.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond and Sheingorn, p. 192-241&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constructing an Auctor with Chaucer ===

====William Caxton====
While using medieval manuscripts as exemplars, many printers attempted to implant humanist values into the text. They attempted to create a uniform work, displaying many similarities in terms of motivation with the Devotio Moderna.  Early editors and publishers needed definitive works to define a culture.  [[William Caxton]] (1415~1424-1492), an editor, was instrumental in shaping English culture and language, and did so through his authoritative Works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmml.org/research06/catalogue/detail.asp?MSID=111051 A 14th/15th century, Caxton era Works of Chaucer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213202/http://www.hmml.org/research06/catalogue/detail.asp?MSID=111051 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caxton was a transitional figure, who sought to close the gap between manuscript culture and a more humanistic print culture through Chaucer's work.  Specifically, Caxton attempted to make Chaucer appear similar to classical writers and continental poets.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, Lauryn S.. Words made flesh: reading medieval manuscript culture. New York, NY: Routledge, 2004. p. 121-145&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chaucer as humanist ====

Caxton attempted to make Chaucer into an English [[Petrarch]] or [[Virgil]], and realized that new humanistic sixteenth century versions of his work had to recognize fourteenth century versions.  His Chaucer transcended medieval ideals, and became timeless, conforming to humanistic ideals.  This required construction of a literary genealogy referred to older medieval exemplars.  Through his editing, Chaucer was framed as an early promoter of the Renaissance, who decried Gothic and medieval culture, and who rescued the English language.

&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, p. 121-148&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Caxton and the flaws of "Olde Bookes" ====

Caxton wanted to discard âold bookesâ that were characteristic of medieval culture.  To do this, he modernized older terms and introduced Latinate spellings.  He removed the influence of manuscript culture, that allowed the reader to have some textual authority.  Caxton believed that printed books could set a defined authorship, in which the reader would not feel it appropriate to change the text or add glosses.  He believed that cheap versions of this authorial Chaucer would allow a diverse group of readers to develop common economic and political ideals, unifying the culture of England.  He was the exemplum for the English standard.  His version of Chaucer was well liked by [[Henry VII of England]], who decided to spread it in order to help provide England with a common cultural background.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, p. 132-148&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Changing perceptions of the book ====

To most people in the late age of manuscript culture,  books were codices first, vehicles for text, regardless of whether they were printed or handwritten.  The cost of obtaining them determined the standard, and printed books gradually gained precedence.  William Caxton stated that his readers could have them âgood cheapâ, and that the quality of text was improved, if not equaled, in print. Many catalogues from the period do list both kinds indiscriminately.  However, in auctions a careful distinction was made between the two, as anything handwritten fetched a higher price.&lt;ref&gt;Lotte, p. 64-84&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Popular assumptions and historical revision ===

Many scholars of [[print culture]], as well as [[classicists]], have argued that inconsistencies existed among manuscripts due to the blind copying of texts and a static manuscript culture that (specifically medieval manuscript culture) existed during the rise of the printing press.  They have stated that once a mistake was made, it would be repeated endlessly and compounded with further mistakes by refusing to deviate from the previous exemplar, thus exposing an obvious advantage of print. The noted classicist E.J. Kenney, whose work formed much of the early scholarship on this issue, stated that  âmedieval authors, scribes, and readers had no notion of emending a text, when they were confronted with an obvious error in their exemplars, other than by slavishly copying the readings of another textâ. There was a great diversity among them in terms of changes in style and a willingness to deviate from prior exemplars, however, as observed in [http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/medieval/jpegs/lat/th/c/1500/03101061.jpg this] copy of [[Jerome]]'s Epistolae Morale, compared to  [http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/medieval/jpegs/lat/class/c/1500/00700908.jpg this] copy of [[Cicero]]'s Letters, both dating from the 16th century.  Many historians and specifically medievalists argue that the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries demonstrated reforms that accommodated many of the functions associated with print. Also, many classicists naturally looked to reproductions of classical texts during the period, which were not necessarily characteristic of other work that was deemed more important. Universality and uniformity, medievalists believe, was seen among some late manuscripts, along with other changes typically associated with the printed book.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 427-429&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the recent scholarship on Late Manuscript Culture was specifically generated by [[Elizabeth Eisenstein]],&lt;ref&gt;
Elizabeth Eisenstein, Print as an Agent of Change, 2 vols. (Cambridge: University Press, 1979). p. 328-329&lt;/ref&gt; a key print culture scholar, and arguably creator of the "print culture" model.  Eisenstein  argued that the invention of the printing press eventually led to the Renaissance, and the social conditions necessary for its occurrence.  The printing press allowed readers to free themselves from many limitations of the manuscript.  She did not detail the state of manuscript and scribal culture in the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, however.  She described in depth the conditions present in Germany at the time of the printing presses' invention in [[Mainz]], and detailed the scribal culture in England and France in order to compare print culture and manuscript culture. She didn't describe Italian humanists in [[Florence]] and renewed religious orders of the Modern Devotion in the Low Countries and Germany.  These included the [[Windesheim Congregation]], of which Oswald de Corda was a member.  Many medievalists, specifically Mary A. Rouse and Richard H. Rouse,  responded by attempting to  create a more detailed account of late manuscript culture, and defined its distinctive characteristics. This is part of the belief that changes occurred during the period that print culture scholars, such as Eisenstein, ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p. 465-466&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7975">'''Multilingual Education''' typically refers to "first-language-first" education, that is, schooling which begins in the mother tongue and transitions to additional languages.  Typically MLE programs are situated in developing countries where speakers of minority languages, i.e. non-dominant languages, tend to be disadvantaged in the mainstream education system. There are increasing calls to provide first-language-first education to immigrant children from immigrant parents who have moved to the developed  world.

== Components of Multilingual Education (MLE) ==

* '''"Strong Foundation"''' - Research shows that children whose early education is in the language of their home tend to do better in the later years of their education ([https://archive.is/20040627111339/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/pubs/resource/effectiveness/ Thomas and Collier, 1997]).  For more information about the effect of "Language of Instruction", see [[Bilingual education]].
* '''"Strong Bridge"''' - an essential difference between MLE programs and rural "mother tongue education" programs is the inclusion of a guided transition from learning through the mother tongue to learning through another tongue.

Related to the emphasis on a child's mother tongue is the implicit validation of her cultural or ethnic identity by taking languages which were previously considered "non-standard" and making active use of them in the classroom.  Multilingual Education in that sense underscores the importance of the child's worldview in shaping his or her learning.

== Stages of an MLE Program  ==

A widespread understanding of MLE programs (UNESCO, 2003, 2005) suggests that instruction take place in the following stages:

# '''Stage I''' - learning takes place entirely in the child's home language
# '''Stage II''' - building fluency in the mother tongue.  Introduction of oral L2.
# '''Stage III''' - building oral fluency in L2. Introduction of literacy in L2.
# '''Stage IV''' - using both L1 and L2 for lifelong learning.

MLE proponents stress that the second language acquisition component is seen as a "two-way" bridge, such that learners gain the ability to move back and forth between their mother tongue and the other tongue(s), rather than simply a transitional literacy program where reading through the mother tongue is abandoned at some stage in the education.

Based  on the  theories of  Multilingual Education  that are spelled out  here, Andhra Pradesh  and Orissa have adopted a thematic approach  to multilingual education. Using a seasonal calendar within a relevant cultural context has  provided a space to the tribal children of  Orissa  and Andhra Pradesh to rediscover their culture through their language. The Multilingual  Education  in this approach  emphasizes  first  language first  in the  child  taking  the  socio- cultural curriculum  in to classroom  culture  and   then  bridge  to  second  language.
In addition to the  basic theory of Paulo Freire on critical pedagogy, Gramscian  theory on education,  Lev  Vigostky's scaffolding  and Piaget's  theory  of cognition is applied in the  Multilingual Education. The unique  thing in  this  approach is to  involve the community   in creating their  own  curriculum  and  minimise the  theoretical hegemony, thereby  creating  a new set of people who believe in the ethics of creating  and  sharing knowledge for the society than to  limit  it to the  theoreticians.
 
===Multilingual Education in Odisha===
  
Odisha  is a multilingual state having  more than  40  ethnic language  among the 62  scheduled tribes, along with the   Modern  Indian  Languages like  Hindi, Bengali and  Telugu. To   address  the  language-  education of  ethnic minorities  children in  schools, Odisha government  started  Multilingual Education programme,ten tribal languages. Led by  Dr MAhendra Kumar Mishra, as the  Director of Multilingual Education  and   guided by Prof. D P Pattanayak and  Prof Khageswar  Mahapatra, the eminent multilingual  Experts, the state   government  started  MLE  programme in te tribal languages in 547  schools. 10 tribal languages were adopted. These are Santali, Saora,  Kui, Kuvi, Koya, Kishan, Oroam, Juang, Bonda  and   Ho.  Culturally responsive curriculum  and text books were prepared for class i to   Class  V  to maintain  mother tongue based multilingual education to   educate the  tribal children.  State government appointed  teachers from the same language community in  the schools  to  teach the tribal children.A language policy was also formulated. The programme  was also supported by Summer Institute of Linguistics led by Mr Steve Simpson  and Vicky Simpson, Pamela Mackenzie.  The curriculum and text books were prepared by the   tribal teachers guided by the MLE resource groups.  It was initiated in  2005  and  isnow  running in   2250 schools  with majority tribal children.  This  is a sustained MLE programme in Asian countries.About  7  Asian countries have  visited the  MLE schools. 
 Dr Mahendra  Kumar Mishra, started  MLE programme in Chhatishgarh adopting  Durua  language  in  MLE programme.

[[File:KoninklijkeBibliotheek2.jpg|thumb|As the logos on the window show, the RKD shares the same building (located near [[Den Haag Centraal]]) with the {{Interlanguage link multi|Nederlands Letterkundig Museum|nl}} (LM), the [[Huygens Institute for Dutch History|Huygens ING]], the [[Netherlands Music Institute]] (NMI) and the [[National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]].]]

The '''Netherlands Institute for Art History''' or '''RKD''' (Dutch: '''RKD-Nederlands Instituut voor Kunstgeschiedenis''') is located in [[The Hague]] and is home to the largest [[art history]] center in the world. The center specializes in documentation, archives, and books on [[Western art]] from the late Middle Ages until modern times. All of this is open to the public, and much of it has been digitized and is available on their website. The main goal of the bureau is to collect, categorize, and make art research available, most notably in the field of [[Dutch Masters]].

Via the available databases, the visitor can gain insight into archival evidence on the lives of many artists of past centuries. The library owns approximately 450,000 titles, of which ca. 150,000 are auction catalogs. There are ca. 3,000 magazines, of which 600 are currently running subscriptions. Though most of the text is in Dutch, the standard record format includes a link to library entries and images of known works, which include English as well as Dutch titles.

The RKD also manages the Dutch version of the [[Art and Architecture Thesaurus]], a [[thesaurus]] of terms for management of information on art and architecture. The original version is an initiative of the [[Getty Research Institute]] in [[Los Angeles, California]].

==History==
The collection was started through bequests by [[Frits Lugt]], art historian and owner of a massive collection of drawings and prints, and [[Cornelis Hofstede de Groot]] (1863â1930), a collector, art historian and museum curator. Their bequest formed the basis for both the art collection and the library, which is now mostly housed in the [[Koninklijke Bibliotheek, National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]] (National Library).
==Open access website==
Though not all of the library's holdings have been digitised, much of its [[metadata]] is accessible online. The website itself is available in both a Dutch and an English user interface.
===Online artist pages===
In the artist database ''RKDartists'', each artist is assigned a record number. To reference an artist page directly, use the code listed at the bottom of the record, usually of the form: https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/ followed by the artist's record number. For example, the artist record number for [[Salvador DalÃ­]] is 19752, so his RKD artist page can be referenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/19752 |title=Salvador DalÃ­ |publisher=Netherlands Institute for Art History |date= |accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wikidata property|P650}}
===Online artworks pages===
In the images database ''RKDimages'', each artwork is assigned a record number. To reference an artwork page directly, use the code listed at the bottom of the record, usually of the form: https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/ followed by the artwork's record number. For example, the artwork record number for [[The Night Watch]] is 3063, so its RKD artwork page can be referenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/3063 |title=Civic guardsmen of Amsterdam under command of Banninck Cocq |publisher=Netherlands Institute for Art History |date= |accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wikidata property |P350 }}
{{commons category|RKDimages}}

===Online thesaurus of art terms===
The Art and Architecture Thesaurus also assigns a record for each term, but these can not be referenced online by record number. Rather, they are used in the databases and the databases can be searched for terms. For example, the painting called "The Night Watch" is a militia painting, and all records fitting this keyword (Dutch: ''algemene trefwoord'') can be seen by selecting this from the image screen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images#filters%5BRKD_algemene_trefwoorden%5D=militia%20painting All available records for "militia painting"] in RKDimages&lt;/ref&gt;

The thesaurus is a set of general terms, but the RKD also contains a database for an alternate form of describing artworks, that today is mostly filled with biblical references. This is the [[iconclass]] database. To see all images that depict Miriam's dance, the associated iconclass code 71E1232 can be used as a special search term.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images#filters%5Biconclass_code%5D=71E1232  All available records for iconclass code "71E1232"] in RKDimages&lt;/ref&gt;

The "'''New Perspective on Paul'''" represents a significant shift since the 1960s in the way some scholars, especially [[Protestant]] scholars, interpret the writings of the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]].

Paul, especially in his [[Epistle to the Romans]], advocates justification through faith in [[Jesus Christ]] over justification through works of the Law. In the historic [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] perspective, known as ''[[sola fide]]'', theologians understood Paul as arguing that Christiansâ [[good works]] would not factor into their [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] &amp;ndash; only their [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] would count. But according to the ânew perspectiveâ, Paul was not addressing good works in general, but instead questioning only observances such as [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]], [[Kashrut|dietary laws]], and Sabbath laws, which were the âboundary markersâ&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The New Perspective on Paul|last = Dunn|first = James D. G.|publisher = Eerdmans Publishing Co.|year = 2005|isbn = 978-0-8028-4562-7|location = Grand Rapids|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; that set the Jews apart from the other nations. This grew from the work of [[E. P. Sanders]], ''Paul and Palestinian Judaism'', published in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Paul and Palestinian Judaism|last = Sanders|first = E. P.|publisher = Fortress Press|year = 1977 |isbn = 978-0-8006-1899-5|location = Minneapolis|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanders saw the Jews of Pauline times not as a âlegalistic communityâ, nor as oriented to âsalvation by worksâ. For Sanders, the Jews felt they were saved as they were God's chosen people. By being God's chosen people they were under his [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]]. The Jews kept [[Torah|the Law]] to remain under the covenant &amp;ndash; the Law was not a way of entering the covenant but of staying within the covenant.

==Development==
Since the [[Protestant Reformation]] (c. 1517), studies of [[Pauline epistles|Paulâs writings]] have been heavily influenced by [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] views that are said to ascribe the negative attributes that they associated with [[Christianity in the 16th century|sixteenth-century Roman Catholicism]] to [[Second Temple Judaism]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} These Lutheran and Reformed views on Paul's writings are called âthe old perspectiveâ by adherents of the ânew perspective on Paulâ. The ânew perspectiveâ is an attempt to lift Paul's letters out of the Lutheran-Reformed framework and interpret them based on what is said to be an understanding of first-century Judaism, taken on its own terms.

In 1963 the Lutheran theologian [[Krister Stendahl]] published a paper arguing that the typical Lutheran view of the Apostle Paulâs theology did not fit with statements in [[Pauline Epistles|Paulâs writings]], and in fact was based more on mistaken [[Pauline Christianity|assumptions about Paulâs beliefs]] than careful interpretation of his writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0017816000024779 |jstor = 1508631 |title = The Apostle Paul and the Introspective Conscience of the West |year=1963 |last =Stendahl |first =Krister |journal= [[Harvard Theological Review]] |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=199â215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stendahl warned against imposing modern Western ideas on the Bible, and especially on the works of Paul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url= |title= The Apostle Paul and the Introspective Conscience of the West |last= Stendahl |first= Krister |date= 1963 |journal= [[Harvard Theological Review]] |volume=56 |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 [[E. P. Sanders]] published ''Paul and Palestinian Judaism''.&lt;ref name="P. Sanders, 1977"&gt;{{Citation |first= EP |last= Sanders | author-link= E. P. Sanders |title= Paul and Palestinian Judaism: A Comparison of Patterns of Religion |publisher= Fortress Press |place= Philadelphia |year= 1977}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work he studies Jewish literature and Paulâs writings arguing that the traditional Lutheran understanding of the theology of Judaism and Paul was fundamentally incorrect.

Sanders continued to publish books and articles in this field, and was soon joined by the scholar [[James D. G. Dunn]]. Dunn reports that Anglican theologian [[N.T. Wright]] was the first to use the term ânew perspective on Paulâ in his 1978 Tyndale Lecture.&lt;ref&gt;[[N.T. Wright]], {{Google books|id=6i2xvonpvMwC&amp;redir_esc=y|page=11-2|title=Justification: God's Plan and Paul's Vision}}. SPCK, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-281-06090-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term became more widely known after being used by Dunn as the title of his 1982 Manson Memorial Lecture where he summarized and affirmed the movement,&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard N. Longenecker]], {{Google books|id=5Qs54KfN5dIC|page=327|title=Introducing Romans: Critical Issues in Paul's Most Famous Letter}}. Eerdmans, 2011. {{ISBN|978-0802866196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first = James D. G. |last =Dunn |authorlink= James Dunn (theologian) |year = 1983 | title = The New Perspective on Paul |journal= Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester |volume=65 | issue =2 |pages=95â122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of these writers inspired a large number of scholars to study, discuss, and debate the relevant issues. Many books and articles dealing with the issues raised have since been published. [[N. T. Wright]] has written a large number of works aimed at popularising the ânew perspectiveâ outside of academia.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{Citation | first = NT | last = Wright | author-link = N. T. Wright | title = What Saint Paul Really Said | publisher = Eerdmans | year = 1997}}{{Page needed|date= December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ânew-perspectiveâ movement is closely connected with a surge of recent scholarly interest in studying the Bible in the context of other ancient texts, and the use of social-scientific methods to understand ancient culture. Scholars affiliated with [[The Context Group]]{{refn|group=note|see: [[Philip Esler|Esler, Philip F.]] ''Conflict and Identity in Romans: The Social Setting of Paul's Letter''. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2003. - [[Bruce J. Malina|Malina, Bruce J.]] &amp; Neyrey, Jerome H., ''Portraits of Paul: An Archaeology of Ancient Personality'', Louisville: John Knox Press, 1996. - Neyrey, Jerome H., ''Paul, in Other Words: A Cultural Reading of His Letters''. Louisville: John Knox Press, 1990.}} have called for various reinterpretations of biblical texts based on studies of the ancient world.

== Main ideas ==
It is often noted that the singular title "the new perspective" gives an unjustified impression of unity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} It is a field of study in which many scholars{{who|date=September 2018}} are actively pursuing research and continuously revising their own theories in light of new evidence, and who do not necessarily agree with each other on any given issue. It has been suggested by many that a plural title of "new" perspective''s'' may therefore be more accurate.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} In 2003, N. T. Wright, distancing himself from both Sanders and Dunn, commented that "there are probably almost as many 'new' perspective positions as there are writers espousing it â and I disagree with most of them".&lt;ref name = "NTW NP"&gt;N. T. Wright, ''[http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_New_Perspectives.htm New Perspectives].&lt;/ref&gt; There are certain trends and commonalities within the movement, but what is held in common is the belief that the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives of [[Paul the Apostle and Judaism]] are fundamentally incorrect. The following are some of the issues being widely discussed.

=== Works of the Law ===
Paul's letters contain a substantial amount of criticism of "[[Law and Gospel|works of the law]]". The radical difference in these two interpretations of what Paul meant by "works of the law" is the most consistent distinguishing feature between the two perspectives. The historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives interpret this phrase as referring to human effort to do good works in order to meet God's standards ([[Legalism (theology)|Works Righteousness]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} In this view, Paul is arguing against the idea that humans can merit salvation from God by their good works alone (note that the "new" perspective agrees that we cannot merit salvation; the issue is what exactly Paul is addressing).

By contrast, new-perspective scholars see Paul as talking about "badges of covenant membership" or criticizing Gentile believers who had begun to rely on the Torah to reckon Jewish kinship.&lt;ref&gt;For "badges of covenant membership", see N. T. Wright, ''Paul for Everyone: Romans part one'' (Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 2004), 35â41. 5. For reliance on the Torah to reckon Jewish kinship, see {{cite journal |last=Eisenbaum |first=Pamela |date=Winter 2004 |title=A Remedy for Having Been Born of Woman: Jesus, Gentiles, and Genealogy in Romans
 |journal=Journal of Biblical Literature |volume=123 |issue=4 |pages=671â702 |url=http://www.sbl-site.org/assets/pdfs/JBL1234.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-26 |doi=10.2307/3268465 |publisher=The Society of Biblical Literature |jstor=3268465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that in Paul's time, Israelites were being faced with a choice of whether to continue to follow their ancestral customs, the [[Torah]] ("the ancestral customs"), or to follow the Roman Empire's trend to adopt Greek customs ([[Hellenization]], see also [[Antinomianism]], [[Hellenistic Judaism]], and [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity]]). The new-perspective view is that Paul's writings discuss the comparative merits of following [[Torah|ancient Israelite]] or [[Athenian Golden Age|ancient Greek customs]]. Paul is interpreted as being critical of a common Jewish view that following traditional Israelite customs makes a person better off before God, pointing out that Abraham was righteous before the Torah was given. Paul identifies customs he is concerned about as [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]], [[Taboo food#Blood|dietary laws]], and [[Sabbath in Christianity|observance of special days]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, James D. 'The New Perspective on Paul', 104, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human effort and good works ===
Due to their interpretation of the phrase "works of the law", theologians of the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives see Paul's rhetoric as being against human effort to earn righteousness. This is often cited by Lutheran and Reformed theologians as a central feature of the Christian religion, and the concepts of [[sola gratia|grace alone]] and [[sola fide|faith alone]] are of great importance within the creeds of these denominations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

"New-perspective" interpretations of Paul tend to result in Paul having nothing negative to say about the idea of human effort or good works, and saying many positive things about both. New-perspective scholars point to the many statements in Paul's writings that specify the criteria of [[Last judgment|final judgment]] as being the works of the individual.

{{Quote | Final Judgment According to Works... was quite clear for Paul (as indeed for Jesus). Paul, in company with mainstream second-Temple Judaism, affirms that Godâs final judgment will be in accordance with the entirety of a life led â in accordance, in other words, with works. | N. T. Wright&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_New_Perspectives.htm | title = New Perspectives on Paul | publisher = 10th Edinburgh Dogmatics Conference |date=August 2003 | first = N. T | last = Wright}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wright however does not hold the view that good works contribute to one's salvation but rather that the final judgment is something we can look forward to as a future vindication of God's present declaration of our righteousness. In other words, our works are a result of our salvation and the future judgment will show that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_New_Perspectives.pdf | title = New perspective | last = Wright | first = NT | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Others tend to place a higher value on the importance of good works than the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives do, taking the view that they causally contribute to the salvation of the individual.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Advocates of the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives often see this as being "salvation by works", and as a bad thing, contradicting fundamental tenets of Christianity. New-perspective scholars often respond that their views are not so different. For in the perspective of Luther and Calvin, God graciously empowers the individual to the faith which leads to salvation and also to good works, while in the "new" perspective God graciously empowers individuals to the faith and good works, which lead to salvation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

=== Faith, or faithfulness ===
An ongoing debate related to the "new" perspective has been over Paul's use of the Greek word ''pistis'' (''ÏÎ¯ÏÏÎ¹Ï'', meaning "trust", "belief", "faith", or "faithfulness"). Writers with a more historic Lutheran and Reformed perspective have typically interpreted this word as meaning a [[Faith in Christianity|belief in God and Christ]], and trust in Christ for salvation with faith that he will save you.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} This interpretation is based on several passages from the Christian Bible, notably the [[Deutero-Pauline]] epistle to the Ephesians: "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast" (Eph. 2:9). [[E. P. Sanders]] has conceded that Ephesians 2:9 teaches the traditional perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Prentiss Waters, Justification and the New Perspectives on Paul, p. 167, notes "Sanders has conceded to me that Ephesians 2:9 teaches the traditional view."&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, many recent studies of the Greek word ''pistis'' have concluded that its primary and most common meaning was ''faithfulness'', meaning firm commitment in an interpersonal relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas A. Campbell, "The Quest For Paulâs Gospel: A Suggested Strategy", 2005, pp. 178â207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=3267114 |pages=461â476 |last1=Hay |first1=D. M. |title=Pistis as "Ground for Faith" in Hellenized Judaism and Paul |volume=108 |issue=3 |journal=Journal of Biblical Literature |year=1989 |doi=10.2307/3267114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=212â5 |doi=10.1177/001452467408500710 |title=The 'Faith of Christ' |year=1974 |last1=Howard |first1=G. |journal=The Expository Times |volume=85 |issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pilch and Malina, "Handbook of Biblical Social Values", 1998, pg 72â75&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the word could be almost synonymous with "obedience" when the people in the relationship held different status levels (e.g. a slave being faithful to his master). Far from being equivalent to "lack of human effort", the word seems to imply and require human effort. The interpretation of Paul's writings that we need "faithfully" to obey God's commands is quite different from one which sees him saying that we need to have "faith" that he will do everything for us. This is also argued to explain why James was adamant that "faith without works is dead" and that "a man is justified by works, and not by faith alone" (Js. 2:24), while also saying that merely to believe places one on the same level as the demons (see [[Epistle of James#Content|James 2]]). The "new" perspective argues that James was concerned with those who were trying to reduce faith to an intellectual subscription without any intent to follow God or Jesus, and that Paul always intended "faith" to mean a full submission to God.

Another related issue is the ''pistis Christou'' ("faith of Christ") debate. Paul several times uses this phrase at key points in his writings and it is linguistically ambiguous as to whether it refers to our faith in Christ ("objective genitive"), or Christ's own faithfulness to God ("subjective genitive"), or even our faith/faithfulness to God like that which Christ had ("adjectival genitive"). There is wide disagreement within the academic community over which of these is the best rendering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Synthesis inline|date=December 2011}}See, e.g.: '''for subjective genitive''':

(emphasis added. Also see [http://net.bible.org/#!bible/Galatians+2:21 Gal. 2:20]).{{Primary source inline|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grace, or favor ===
Writers with a more historic Lutheran and Reformed perspective have generally translated the Greek word ''charis'' as "grace" and understood it to refer to the idea that there is a lack of human effort in salvation because God is the controlling factor. However those who study ancient Greek culture have pointed out that "favor" is a better translation, as the word refers normally to "doing a favor". In ancient societies there was the expectation that such favors be repaid, and this semi-formal system of favors acted like loans.&lt;ref&gt;David A.deSilva, Honor, Patronage, Kinship and Purity: Unlocking New Testament Culture, 2000, pg 117&lt;/ref&gt; Gift giving corresponded with the expectation of reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;B. J. Oropeza, "The Expectation of Grace," ''Bulletin for Biblical Research'' 24.2 (2014) 207-226&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is argued that when Paul speaks of how God did us a "favor" by sending Jesus, he is saying that God took the initiative, but is not implying a lack of human effort in salvation, and is in fact implying that Christians have an obligation to repay the favor God has done for them. Some argue that this view then undermines the initial "favor"âof sending Jesusâby saying that, despite his life, death and resurrection, Christians still have, as before, to earn their way to heaven. However, others note this is the horns of a [[false dilemma]] (all grace versus all works). Many new-perspective proponents that see "charis" as "favor" do not teach that Christians ''earn'' their way to heaven outside of the death of Christ. Forgiveness of sins through the blood of Christ is still necessary to salvation. But, that forgiveness demands effort on the part of the individual (cf. Paul in Phil. 3:12â16).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Romans_Theology_Paul.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Atonement ===
{{See also|Atonement in Christianity}}
To writers of the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives the [[penal substitution]] atonement theory and the belief in the "finished work" of Christ have been central. New-perspective writers have regularly questioned whether this view is really of such central importance in Paul's writings. Generally new-perspective writers have argued that other theories of the atonement are more central to Paul's thinking, but there has been minimal agreement among them as to what Paul's real view of the atonement might be.

The following is a broad sample of different views advocated by various scholars:
* E. P. Sanders argued that Paul's central idea was that we mystically spiritually participate in the risen Christ and that all Paul's judicial language was subordinate to the participationary language.&lt;ref name="P. Sanders, 1977"/&gt;
* N. T. Wright has argued that Paul sees Israel as representative of humanity and taking onto itself the sinfulness of humanity through history. Jesus, in turn, as Messiah is representative of Israel and so focuses the sins of Israel on himself on the cross. Wright's view is thus a "historicized" form of Penal Substitution.&lt;ref&gt;N. T.

== Criticism ==
The "new" perspective has been an extremely controversial subject and has drawn strong arguments and recriminations from both sides of the debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2007/august/13.22.html|title=What Did Paul Really Mean? - Christianity Today|author=Simon Gathercole|work=ChristianityToday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 [[Steve Chalke]], after being influenced by new-perspective writers, published a book targeted at a popular audience which made comments highly critical of the [[penal substitution]] theory of the atonement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Steve | last1 = Chalke | first2 = Alan | last2 = Mann | title = The Lost Message of Jesus | publisher = Zondervan | year = 2003}}.{{Page needed|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused an extensive and ongoing controversy among Evangelicals in Britain, with a strong backlash from laypeople and advocates of the [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, Pat. "Atonement row gets personal as Evangelical partnership splits", 'Church Times', 27 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Chalke's views drew much support as well as criticism, with numerous articles, blogs and books being written on both sides of the debate.

The continuing controversy led to the [[Evangelical Alliance]] organising a symposium in July 2005 to discuss the issue. A record of this symposium includes a chapter by Chalke and his views are also contained in "the atonement debate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Derek Tidball, David Hilborn, | first = Justin Thacker | title = the atonement debate | page = 34 to 45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.eauk.org/media/joint-evangelical-alliance-london-school.cfm |title = Joint Evangelical Alliance&amp;nbsp;â London School Of Theology Atonement Symposium |accessdate = 2007-08-26 |date = 2005-07-08 |publisher = [[Evangelical Alliance]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Stephen |first = Jonathan |url = http://www.evangelical-times.org/archive/item/950/Biblical-theological/Chalkegate/ |title = Chalkegate |accessdate = 2011-11-25 |date = February 2005 |publisher = [[Evangelical Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of three [[Conservative Evangelicalism|conservative evangelical]] theologians responded to Chalke with their book, ''Pierced for our Transgressions'' (Crossway Publishing, 2007), which strongly criticised Chalke's position as inconsistent with some evangelical confessions of faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jeffery | first = Steve |author2=Mike Ovey |authorlink2=Mike Ovey |author3=Andrew Sach | isbn = 1-84474-178-8 | publisher = [[Inter-Varsity Press]] | title = Pierced for our Transgressions&amp;nbsp;â Rediscovering the Glory of Penal Substitution }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.piercedforourtransgressions.com | title = Pierced for our Transgressions&amp;nbsp;â Rediscovering the Glory of Penal Substitution | accessdate = 2007-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[N. T. Wright]] endorsed Chalke and spoke out against the latter book, commenting, for instance, that âdespite the ringing endorsements of famous men, it [''Pierced For Our Transgressions''] is deeply, profoundly, and disturbingly unbiblical.â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Wright |first = NT |authorlink = N.

Both sides of the debate have attempted to claim the higher, and more accurate, view of scripture. New-perspective advocates claim that supporters of the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspective are too committed to historic [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] tradition, and therefore fail to take a "natural" reading of the Bible; while those of the Lutheran and Reformed perspectives claim that new-perspective advocates are too intrigued by certain interpretations of context and history, which then lead to a biased hermeneutical approach to the text.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

The "new" perspective has been heavily criticized by conservative scholars in the Reformed tradition, arguing that it undermines the classical, individualistic, Augustinian interpretation of election and does not faithfully reflect the teachings of the Scriptures. It has been the subject of fierce debate among Evangelicals in recent years, mainly due to N. T. Wright's increasing popularity in [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] circles. Its most outspoken critics include Calvinists [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]],&lt;ref&gt;John Piper, [http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/interviews/interview-with-john-piper-about-the-future-of-justification-a-response-to-n-t-wright Interview with Piper on Wright], October 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sinclair Ferguson]],&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair Ferguson, [http://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/what-does-justification-have-do-gospel/ What Does Justification Have to do with the Gospel?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ligon Duncan and Sinclair Ferguson (video resource) [http://www.ligonier.org/learn/media/wright-teaching-another-gospel/ Is Wright Teaching Another Gospel?]&lt;/ref&gt; C.

In 2015 [[John M.G. Barclay]] published ''Paul and the Gift'' which re-frames Paul's theology of grace and, in doing so, provides a nuanced critique of the New Perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eerdmans.com/Products/6889/paul-and-the-gift.aspx|title=Paul and the Gift - John M.

== Catholic and Orthodox reactions ==
The "new" perspective has, by and large, been an internal debate among Protestant scholars. [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] writers have generally responded favorably to new-perspective ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Despotis, A., Die âNew Perspective on Paulâ und die griechisch-orthodoxe Paulusinterpretation, [VIOTh 11], St. Ottilien: EOS-Verlag 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-8306-7705-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeing both a greater commonality with their own beliefs and strong similarities with the views of many of the early [[Church Fathers]]. From a Catholic point of view, the "new" perspective is seen as a step toward the progressive reality of human salvation in Christ. Moreover, passages in the works of many early Church Fathers show that new-perspective-style interpretations were widely held among them.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, "Against Heresy" 4:13â16. Ambrosiaster, "Commentary on Romans". Pelagius, "Commentary on Romans". Origen "Commentary on Romans". Justin Martyr, "Dialogue" Ch 10â11. Clement of Alexandria, "Stromata" 6:6. Ignatius, "Magnesians" 8. Cyril of Jerusalem, "Catechetical Lectures" 4:33.{{Synthesis inline|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the many exceptions is the influential [[Augustine of Hippo]]. While most in the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox schools would see him as espousing a view of grace and justification in keeping with this "new" perspective, Augustine is blamed by some for introducing incorrect ideas{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. Some Orthodox have long criticized Augustine's soteriology, claiming it introduced novelties into Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Fr. John Romanides, The Ancestral Sin, Zephyr Publishing, Ridgewood, NJ, 1998, passim&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased importance new-perspective writers have given to good works in salvation has created strong common ground with the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. Historic [[Protestantism]] has never denied that there is a place for good and faithful works, but has always excluded them from [[Justification (theology)|justification]] and salvation, which Protestants argue is through [[faith alone]], and to which good deeds do not contribute, whether with or without God's grace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Augsburg Confession|url=http://bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.php#article20|work=Book of Concord|accessdate=8 September 2012|location=Article 20|quote=[..]Furthermore, it is taught on our part that it is necessary to do good works, not that we should trust to merit grace by them, but because it is the will of God. It is only by faith that forgiveness of sins is apprehended, and that, for nothing. And because through faith the Holy Ghost is received, hearts are renewed and endowed with new affections, so as to be able to bring forth good works. For Ambrose says: Faith is the mother of a good will and right doing. For man's powers without the Holy Ghost are full of ungodly affections, and are too weak to do works which are good in God's sight. Besides, they are in the power of the devil who impels men to divers sins, to ungodly opinions, to open crimes. This we may see in the philosophers, who, although they endeavored to live an honest life could not succeed, but were defiled with many open crimes. Such is the feebleness of man when he is without faith and without the Holy Ghost, and governs himself only by human strength. Hence it may be readily seen that this doctrine is not to be charged with prohibiting good works, but rather the more to be commended, because it shows how we are enabled to do good works.[..]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calvin|first=John|title=Commentary on James|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom45.vi.iii.vi.html|work=Commentary on the Catholic Epistles|accessdate=8 September 2012|authorlink=John Calvin|location=James 2:18-19|quote=[..]This only he means, that faith, without the evidence of good works, is vainly pretended, because fruit ever comes from the living root of a good tree.[..]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has, since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], been a line of distinction between Protestantism (both [[Reformed]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canons of Dort|url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/dort.htm|accessdate=9 September 2012|location=FIRST HEAD: PARAGRAPH 3.|quote=Rejections of errors[..][of those W]ho teach: That the good pleasure and purpose of God, of which Scripture makes mention in the doctrine of election, does not consist in this, that God chose certain persons rather than others, but in this, that He chose out of all possible conditions (among which are also the works of the law), or out of the whole order of things, that act of faith which from its very nature is undeserving, as well as it incomplete obedience, as a condition of salvation, and that He would graciously consider this in itself as a complete obedience and count it worthy of the reward of eternal life. For by this injurious error the pleasure of God and the merits of Christ are made of none effect, and men are drawn away by useless questions from the truth of gracious justification and from the simplicity of Scripture, and this declaration of the apostle is charged as untrue: "who has saved us and called us to a holy life, not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time (2 Tim 1:9)."|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919133747/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/dort.htm|archivedate=19 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lutheran]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Augsburg Confession|url=http://bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.php#article12|work=Book of Concord|accessdate=8 September 2012|location=Article XII|quote=They also are rejected who do not teach that remission of sins comes through faith but command us to merit grace through satisfactions of our own.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and other Christian communions.

French social philosopher [[Alfred Espinas]] gave the term its modern meaning, and its study was developed independently by two principal groups: the [[Austrian school]] created by [[Ludwig von Mises]] and the Polish school created by [[Tadeusz KotarbiÅski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Ryan |editor1-first=Leo V. |editor2-last=Nahser |editor2-first=F.

==Origin and etymology==
Coinage of the word ''praxeology'' is often credited to Louis Bourdeau, the French author of a classification of the sciences, which he published in his ''ThÃ©orie des sciences: Plan de Science intÃ©grale'' in 1882:

{{quote|On account of their dual natures of specialty and generality, these functions should be the subject of a separate science. Some of its parts have been studied for a long time, because this kind of research, in which man could be the main subject, has always presented the greatest interest. Physiology, hygiene, medicine, psychology, animal history, human history, political economy, morality, etc. represent fragments of a science that we would like to establish, but as fragments scattered and uncoordinated have remained until now only parts of particular sciences. They should be joined together and made whole in order to highlight the order of the whole and its unity. Now you have a science, so far unnamed, which we propose to call Praxeology (from ÏÏÎ±Î¾Î¹Ï, action), or by referring to the influence of the environment, [[Mesology]] (from Î¼ÎµÏÎ¿Ï, environment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdeau|first=Louis|title=ThÃ©orie des sciences: Plan de Science intÃ©grale|volume=Tome Second|publisher=Librarie Germer BailliÃ¨re|location=Paris|date=1882|quote=Ã raison de leur double caractÃ¨re de spÃ©cialitÃ© et de gÃ©nÃ©ralitÃ©, les fonctions doivent constituer l'objet d'une science distincte. Quelquesâunes de ses parties ont Ã©tÃ© Ã©tudiÃ©es de bonne heure, car ce genre de recherches, dont l'homme pouvait se faire le sujet principal, a prÃ©sentÃ© de tout temps le plus vif intÃ©rÃªt. La physiologie, l'hygiÃ¨ne, la mÃ©decine, la psychologie, l'histoire des animaux, l'histoire humaine, l'Ã©conomie politique, la morale, etc., reprÃ©sentent des fragments de la science que nous voudrions Ã©tablir; mais fragments, Ã©pars et sans coordination, sont restÃ©s a l'Ã©tat de sciences particuliÃ¨res. Il faudrait les rapprocher et en faire un tout afin de mettre en lumiÃ¨re l'ordre de l'ensemble et son unitÃ©. On aurait alors uneâ¦ science, innommÃ©e jusqu'ici et que nous proposons d'appeler PraxÃ©ologie (de ÏÏÎ±Î¾Î¹Ï, action), ou, en se rÃ©fÃ©rant a l'influence des milieu, MÃ©sologie (de Î¼ÎµÆ¡Î¿Ï, milieu).|page=463|url=http://iris.univ-lille1.fr/handle/1908/3842|access-date={{date|2017-02-04}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the term was used at least once previously (with a slight spelling difference), in 1608, by [[Clemens Timpler]] in his ''Philosophiae practicae systema methodicum'':

{{quote|There was Aretology: Following that Praxiology: which is the second part of the Ethics, in general, commenting on the actions of the moral virtues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Timpler|first=Clemens|title=Philosophiae practicae systema methodicum|volume=libris IV pertractatam|location=Hanoviae|publisher=Apud Gulielmum Antonio|date=1608|page=388|url=https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_IaPUCZDkdQYC#page/n418/mode/1up|access-date={{date|2017-02-04}}|quote=Fuit Aretologia: Sequitur Praxiologia: quÃ¦ est altera pars EthicÃ¦, tractans generaliter de actionibus moralibus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was later mentioned by [[Robert Flint]] in 1904 in a review of Bourdeau's ''ThÃ©orie des sciences''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Flint|title=Philosophy as Scientia Scientiarum|location=Edinburgh|date=1904|pages=254â55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern definition of the word was first given by [[Alfred Espinas|Alfred V. Espinas]] (1844â1922),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ostrowski|first=Jean J.|title=Notes biographiques et bibliographiques sur Alfred Espinas|journal=Review Philosophique de la France et de l'Etranger|location=Paris|publisher=Presses Universitaires de France|number=3|date=JulyâSeptember 1967|pages=385â91}}&lt;/ref&gt; the French philosopher and sociologist; he was the forerunner of the Polish school of the science of [[Efficiency|efficient]] action. The Austro-American school of economics was based on a philosophical science of the same kind.

With a different spelling, the word was used by the English psychologist [[Charles Arthur Mercier]] (in 1911), and proposed by [[Knight Dunlap]] to [[John B. Watson]] as a better name for his [[behaviorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=John B.|title=Behaviourism: The Early Years|volume=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2018}} Watson rejected it. But the Chinese physiologist of behavior, [[Zing-Yang Kuo]] (b. 1898) adopted the term in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Edited by Murchison, Carl Allanmore, ''[[The Journal of Psychology]]'', Volumes 3â4, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2018}} It was also used by [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] (in 1928 and later).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William|last=McDougall|title=The Battle of Behaviorism: An Exposition and an Exposure|date=1928|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Previously the word ''praxiology'', with the meaning Espinas gave to it, was used by [[Tadeusz KotarbiÅski]] (in 1923). Several economists, such as the Ukrainian, [[Eugene Slutsky]] (1926) used it in his attempt to base economics on a theory of action. It was also used by [[Austrian economics|Austrian economist]] Ludwig von Mises (1933), Russian Marxist [[Nikolai Bukharin]] (1888â1938) during the [[Second International]] Congress of History of Science and Technology in London (in 1931), and Polish scholar [[Oskar R. Lange|Oscar Lange]] (1904â1965) in 1959, and later.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The Italian philosopher, Carmelo Ottaviano, was using the Italianised version, ''prassiologia'', in his treatises starting from 1935, but in his own way, as a theory of politics. After the [[Second World War]] the use of the term ''praxeology'' spread widely. After the emigration of Mises to America his pupil [[Murray Rothbard]] defended the praxeological approach. A revival of Espinas's approach in France was revealed in the works of [[Pierre MassÃ©]] (1946), the eminent cybernetician, Georges ThÃ©odule Guilbaud (1953), the Belgian logician, [[Leo Apostel]] (1957), the cybernetician, [[Anatol Rapoport]] (1962), Henry Pierron, psychologist and lexicographer (1957), [[FranÃ§ois Perroux]], economist (1957), the social psychologist, Robert Daval (1963), the well-known sociologist, [[Raymond Aron]] (1963) and the methodologists, Abraham Antoine Moles and Roland Caude (1965).{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Under the influence of [[Tadeusz KotarbiÅski]], praxeology flourished in Poland. A special "Centre of Praxeology" (''Zaklad Prakseologiczny'') was created under the organizational guidance of the Polish Academy of Sciences, with its own periodical (from 1962), called at first ''MateriaÅy Prakseologiczne'' (''Praxeological Papers''), and then abbreviated to ''Prakseologia''. It published hundreds of papers by different authors, and the materials for a special vocabulary edited by Professor Tadeusz Pszczolowski, the leading praxeologist of the younger generation. A sweeping survey of the praxeological approach is to be found in the paper by the French [[statistician]] Micheline Petruszewycz, "A propos de la praxÃ©ologie".&lt;ref&gt;In 'MathÃ©matiques et Sciences Humaines', Paris, Centre de mathÃ©matique sociale et de statistique-Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, No. 11. Ete, 1965, pp. 11â18, and a rejoinder 'RÃ©ponse a un appel' by J. Ostrowski, ''ibid'',, No. 19, Ete, 1967, pp. 21â26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig von Mises]] was influenced by several theories in forming his work on praxeology, including [[Immanuel Kant]]'s works, [[Max Weber]]'s work on [[methodological individualism]], and [[Carl Menger]]'s development of the [[subjective theory of value]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selgin|first=George A.|title=Praxeology and Understanding: An Analysis of the Controversy in Austrian Economics|url=https://mises.org/library/praxeology-and-understanding-analysis-controversy-austrian-economics-0|journal=Review of Austrian Economics|volume=2|date=1987|page=22|access-date={{date|2017-02-04}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Austrian economics==
{{Austrian School sidebar |expanded=Theory}}
[[Austrian economics]] relies heavily on praxeology in the development of its economic theories.&lt;ref name="rothmeth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothbard|first=Murray N.|chapter=Praxeology: The Methodology of Austrian Economics|title=The Foundations of Modern Austrian Economics|date=1976|pages=19â39|chapterurl=https://mises.org/library/praxeology-methodology-austrian-economics|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ludwig von Mises considered economics to be a sub-discipline of praxeology.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Austrian School economists continue to use praxeology and deduction, rather than empirical studies, to determine economic principles. According to its theorists, with the [[action axiom]] as the starting point, it is possible to draw conclusions about human behavior that are both objective and universal. For example, the notion that humans engage in acts of choice implies that they have preferences, and this must be true for anyone who exhibits intentional behavior.

Advocates of praxeology also say that it provides insights for the field of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. "Praxeology, value judgments, and public policy." ''The Foundations of Modern Austrian Economics'' (1976): 89â114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subdivisions===
In 1951, [[Murray Rothbard]] divided the subfields of praxeology as follows:
: A. The Theory of the Isolated Individual ([[Robinson Crusoe Economy|Crusoe Economics]])
: B. The Theory of Voluntary Interpersonal Exchange ([[Catallactics]], or the Economics of the Market)
:: 1. [[Barter]]
:: 2. With [[Money|Medium of Exchange]]
::: a. On the [[Free Market|Unhampered Market]]
::: b. Effects of [[government|Violent Intervention]] with the Market
::: c. Effects of Violent Abolition of the Market (Socialism)
: C. The Theory of [[War]] â Hostile Action
: D. The Theory of Games (e.g., [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern|Morgenstern]])
: E. Unknown
At the time, topics C, D, and E remained open research problems.&lt;ref&gt;Murray N. Rothbard. [https://www.mises.org/library/praxeology-reply-mr-schuller "Praxeology: Reply to Mr. Schuller"], ''[[American Economic Review]]'', December 1951, pp. 943â46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
[[Thomas Mayer (American economist)|Thomas Mayer]] has argued that, because praxeology rejects [[positivism]] and [[empiricism]] in the development of [[Scientific theory#Pedagogical definition|theories]], it constitutes nothing less than a rejection of the [[Scientific method#Characterizations|scientific method]]. For Mayer, this invalidates the methodologies of the [[Austrian school of economics]].&lt;ref name="Mayer1998"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Thomas |last=Mayer |title=Boettke's Austrian critique of mainstream economics: An empiricist's response |publisher=Routledge|journal=Critical Review |date=Winter 1998 |pages=151â71 |ref=harv|doi=10.1080/08913819808443491|volume=12 |quote=}}{{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newton1999"&gt;"Rules for the study of [[natural philosophy]]", {{harvnb |Newton |1999 |pp=794â96 }}, from Book '''3''', ''The System of the World''.&lt;/ref&gt; Austrians argue that that empirical data itself is insufficient to describe economics; that consequently empirical data cannot falsify economic theory; that logical positivism cannot predict or explain human action; and that the methodological requirements of logical positivism are impossible to obtain for economic questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ludwig von|last=Mises|title=Epistemological Problems of Economics|edition=3rd|date=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|translator-last=Reisman|translator-first=George|url=https://mises.org/library/epistemological-problems-economics|accessdate={{date|2017-02|04}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rothmeth" /&gt; Ludwig von Mises in particular argued against empiricist approaches to the social sciences in general, because human events are unique and "unrepeatable," whereas scientific experiments are necessarily reducible.&lt;ref name="MisesHumanAction"&gt;Mises, Ludwig von. ''[[Human Action]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=May 2018}}

However, economist Antony Davies argues that because statistical tests are predicated on the independent development of theory, some form of praxeology is essential for model selection; conversely, the praxeology can illustrate surprising philosophical consequences of economic models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cato-unbound.org/2012/09/12/antony-davies/complementary-approaches|title=Complementary Approaches|first=Antony|last=Davies|date={{date|2012-09-12}}|website=Cato Unbound|access-date={{date|2016-12-27}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johann Georg Seitz GemÃ¼sestilleben mit HÃ¤schen.jpg|thumb|''GemÃ¼sestilleben mit HÃ¤schen'' ("Still Life with Rabbits") by [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Georg_Seitz Johann Georg Seitz] (c. 1870)]]

'''Rabbits and hares are common motifs''' in the [[visual arts]], with variable mythological and artistic meanings in different cultures. The [[rabbit]] as well as the [[hare]] have been associated with [[Lunar deity|moon deities]] and may signify rebirth or resurrection.{{r|Windling}} They may also be symbols of [[fertility]] or sensuality, and they appear in depictions of hunting and spring scenes in the [[Labours of the Months]].

== Judaism ==
[[File:Pederastic gifts Macron Louvre G142 n3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The rabbit as a gift in courtship, exterior detail of a red-figure [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kylix kylix], (Athens c. 480 BC)]]

In [[Judaism]], the rabbit is considered an unclean animal, because "though it [[ruminant|chews the cud]], does not have a [[Cloven hoof|divided hoof]]."&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 11.6, cf. Deuteronomy 14.7&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=rock hyrax}} This led to derogatory statements in the Christian art of the Middle Ages, and to an ambiguous interpretation of the [[Three hares#In Judaism|rabbit's symbolism]]. The "[[Rock Hyrax|shafan]]" in [[Hebrew]] has symbolic meaning. Although rabbits were a non-[[kosher]] animal in the [[Bible]], positive symbolic connotations were sometimes noted, as for [[Three Lions (disambiguation)|lions]] and eagles. 16th century German scholar [[Rabbi]] [[Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi]], saw the rabbits as a symbol of the [[Diaspora]].  In any case, a [[three hares]] motif was a prominent part of many [[Synagogue]]s.{{r|Windling}}{{r|Wonnenberg}}

== Antiquity ==
In antiquity, the hare, because it was prized as a hunting quarry, was seen as the epitome of the hunted creature that could survive only by prolific breeding. [[Herodotus]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories'' 3.108&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Claudius Aelianus]] all described the rabbit as one of the most fertile of animals. It thus became a symbol of vitality, sexual desire and fertility. The hare served as an attribute of [[Aphrodite]] and as a gift between lovers. In [[late antiquity]] it was used as a symbol of good luck and in connection with ancient burial traditions.

== Christian art ==
[[File:1505 Piero di Cosimo Venus, Mars and Cupid anagoria.JPG|thumb|upright=1.8|''Venus, Mars and Cupid'' by [[Piero di Cosimo]], a  Cupid lying on Venus clings to a white rabbit.]]
In [[Early Christian art]], hares appeared on [[relief]]s, [[epitaph]]s, icons and oil lamps although their significance is not always clear.

The ''[[Physiologus]]'', a resource for medieval artists, states that when in danger the rabbit seeks safety by climbing high up rocky cliffs, but when running back down, because of its short front legs, it is quickly caught by its predators.&lt;ref&gt;''Physiologus''. Ed. by Ursula Treu. 3rd edition. Hanau 1998. pp. 103-104 (German).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, according to the teaching of [[St. Basil]], men should seek his salvation in the rock of Christ, rather than descending to seek worldly things and falling into the hands of the [[devil]]. The negative view of the rabbit as an unclean animal, which derived from the [[Old Testament]], always remained present for [[medieval]] artists and their patrons. Thus the rabbit can have a negative connotation of unbridled sexuality and lust or a positive meaning as a symbol of the steep path to salvation. Whether a representation of a hare in Medieval art represents man falling to his doom or striving for his eternal salvation is therefore open to interpretation, depending on context.

[[File:Paderborner Dom Dreihasenfenster.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[three hares]] at [[Paderborn Cathedral]]]]

The ''Hasenfenster'' (hare windows) in [[Paderborn Cathedral]] and in the [[Muotathal]] Monastery in Switzerland, in which [[three hares]] are depicted with only three ears between them, forming a triangle, can be seen as a symbol of the [[Trinity]], and probably go back to an old symbol for the passage of time. The three hares shown in [[Albrecht DÃ¼rer]]'s [[woodcut]], ''The Holy Family with the Three Hares'' (1497), can also be seen as a symbol of the Trinity.

The idea of rabbits as a symbol of vitality, rebirth and resurrection derives from antiquity. This explains their role in connection with [[Easter]], the [[resurrection of Christ]]. The unusual presentation in Christian iconography of a [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] with the [[Child Jesus|Infant Jesus]] playing with a white rabbit in [[Titian]]'s Parisian painting, can thus be interpreted christologically. Together with the basket of bread and wine, a symbol of the sacrificial death of Christ, the picture may be interpreted as the resurrection of Christ after death.

The phenomenon of [[superfetation]], where embryos from different [[menstrual cycle]]s are present in the [[uterus]], results in hares and rabbits being able to give birth seemingly without having been impregnated, which caused them to be seen as symbols of virginity.&lt;ref&gt;Lumpkin, Susan; John Seidensticker (2011). Rabbits: The Animal Answer Guide. JHU Press. {{ISBN|0-8018-9789-0}}. p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbits also live underground, an echo of the tomb of Christ.
[[File:Tizian-Madonna mit dem Kaninchen.jpg|thumb|left|168px|[[Titian]], ''Mary and Infant Jesus with a rabbit'', Paris, Louvre]]
As a symbol of fertility, white rabbits appear on a wing of the high altar in [[Freiburg Minster]]. They are playing at the feet of two pregnant women, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]]. [[Martin Schongauer]]'s engraving ''Jesus after the Temptation'' (1470) shows nine (three times three) rabbits at the feet of Jesus Christ, which can be seen as a sign of extreme vitality.  In contrast, the tiny squashed rabbits at the base of the columns in [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Rolin Madonna]]'' symbolize "Lust", as part of a set of references in the painting to all the [[Seven Deadly Sins]].&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, Craig. ''Jan van Eyck, The Play of Realism'', p. 114, Reaktion Books, London, 1991, {{ISBN|0-948462-18-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Giovanni Bellini St Jerome Reading in the Countryside.jpg|thumb|right|''St. Jerome Reading in the Countryside'', by [[Giovanni Bellini]], with a white hare.]]
Hunting scenes in the sacred context can be understood as the pursuit of good through evil. In the Romanesque sculpture (c. 1135) in the [[KÃ¶nigslutter]] imperial Cathedral, a hare pursued by a hunter symbolises the human soul seeking to escape persecution by the devil. Another painting, ''Hares Catch the Hunters'', shows the triumph of good over evil. Alternatively, when an eagle pursues the hare, the eagle can be seen as symbolizing Christ and the hare, uncleanliness and the evil's terror in the face of the light.

In Christian [[iconography]], the hare is an attribute of Saint [[Martin of Tours]] and Saint Alberto di Siena, because legend has it that both protected hares from persecution by dogs and hunters. They are also an attribute of the patron saint of Spanish hunters, [[Olegarius]] of Barcelona. White hares and rabbits were sometimes the symbols of chastity and purity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bunniesinbaskets.org/the-symbolism-of-rabbits-and-hares-by-terri-windling.html|title=the-symbolism-of-rabbits-and-hares|publisher=bunniesinbaskets.org|accessdate= 1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In secular art ==

[[File:Jan Weenix - Een aap en een hond bij dood wild.jpg|thumb|''Hunting still life with lap dog and monkey'' by Jan Weenix, 1714]]
[[File:Germany Hare flask 03.jpg|thumb|Hare flask by German glassworks, 18th century, [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]]]

In non-religious art of the modern era, the rabbit appears in the same context as in antiquity: as prey for the hunter, or representing spring or autumn, as well as an attribute of Venus and a symbol of physical love.  In cycles of the [[Labours of the Months]], rabbits frequently appear in the spring months. In [[Francesco del Cossa]]'s painting of April in the [[Palazzo Schifanoia]] in [[Ferrara]], Italy, [[Venus]]' children, surrounded by a flock of white rabbits, symbolize love and fertility.

In [[Italian Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] art, rabbits are depicted more often than hares. In an [[allegory]] on lust by [[Pisanello]], a naked woman lies on a couch with a rabbit at her feet. [[Pinturicchio]]'s scene of ''[[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna in the Bath]]'' is displayed in the Vatican's [[Borgia Apartment]]. Here, each of the two old men are accompanied by a pair of hares or rabbits, clearly indicating wanton lust. In [[Piero di Cosimo]]'s painting of Venus and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], a cupid resting on Venus clings to a white rabbit for similar reasons.

[[Still life]]s in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and their [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish equivalents]] often included a moralizing element which was understood by their original viewers without assistance: fish and meat can allude to religious dietary precepts, fish indicating fasting while great piles of meat indicate ''[[Original sin|voluptas carnis]]'' (lusts of the flesh), especially if lovers are also depicted. Rabbits and birds, perhaps in the company of [[carrot]]s and other [[phallic symbol]]s, were easily understood by contemporary viewers in the same sense.

As small animals with fur, hares and rabbits allowed the artist to showcase his ability in painting this difficult material.  Dead hares appear in the works of the earliest painter of still life collections of foodstuffs in a kitchen setting, [[Frans Snyders]], and remain a common feature, very often sprawling hung up by a rear leg, in the works of [[Jan Fyt]], [[Adriaen van Utrecht]] and many other specialists in the genre.  By the end of the 17th century, the grander subgenre of the hunting trophy still life appeared, now set outdoors, as though at the back door of a palace or hunting lodge.  Hares (but rarely rabbits) continued to feature in the works of the Dutch and Flemish originators of the genre, and later French painters like [[Jean-Baptiste Oudry]].&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, William S., "Jean-Baptiste Oudry: Hare and Leg of Lamb", p. 150, ''The Bulletin of the Cleveland Museum of Art'', Vol. 57, No. 5 (May, 1970), pp. 149-158
, Cleveland Museum of Art, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25152331 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Middle Ages]] until modern times, the right to hunt was a vigorously defended privilege of the ruling classes. Hunting [[Still life]]s, often in combination with hunting equipment, adorn the rooms of baroque palaces, indicating the rank and prestige of their owners. [[Jan Weenix]]' painting shows a still life reminiscent of a trophy case with birds and small game, fine fruits, a pet dog and a pet monkey, arranged in front of a classicising garden sculpture with the figure of [[Hercules]] and an opulent palace in the background. The wealth and luxurious lifestyle of the patron or owner is clearly shown.
 
The children's tales of the English author [[Beatrix Potter]], illustrated by herself, include several titles featuring the badly behaved [[Peter Rabbit]] and other rabbit characters, including her first and most successful book ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'' (1902), followed by ''[[The Tale of Benjamin Bunny]]'' (1904), and ''[[The Tale of The Flopsy Bunnies]]'' (1909).  Potter's anthropomorphic clothed rabbits are probably the most familiar artistic rabbits in the English-speaking world, no doubt influenced by illustrations by [[John Tenniel]] of the [[White Rabbit]] in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s book ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.

[[Joseph Beuys]], who always finds a place for a rabbit in his works, sees it as symbolizing resurrection. In the context of his action "[[How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare]]", he stated that the rabbit "...has a direct relationship to birth... For me, the rabbit is the symbol of incarnation. Because the rabbit shows in reality what man can only show in his thoughts. He buries himself, he buries himself in a depression. He incarnates himself in the earth, and that alone is important."

''[[Masquerade (book)]]'' (1979), written and illustrated by the artist [[Kit Williams]], is ostensibly a childrenâs book, but contains elaborate clues to the location of a jewelled golden hare, also made by Williams, which he had buried at the location in England to which the clues in the book led.  The hare was not found until 1982, in what later emerged as dubious circumstances.

The Welsh sculptor [[Barry Flanagan]] (1944-2009) was best known for his energetic bronzes of hares, which he produced throughout his career. Many have a comic element, and the length and thinness of the hare's body is often exaggerated.

=== DÃ¼rer's ''Young Hare'' ===
{{Anchor|DÃ¼rer's hare|reason="DÃ¼rer's hare" is the old subsection name, which was changed to "DÃ¼rer's ''Young Hare''" on 8 March 2018.}}
[[File:Albrecht DÃ¼rer - Hare, 1502 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Young Hare]]'', by [[Albrecht DÃ¼rer]] (1502)]]
[[File:Wolpertinger.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Wolpertinger]]'' (2005), in the style of Albrecht DÃ¼rer]]

Probably one of the most famous depictions of an animal in the history of European art is the painting ''[[Young Hare]]'' by [[Albrecht DÃ¼rer]], completed in 1502 and now preserved in the [[Albertina]] in Vienna. DÃ¼rer's [[watercolor]] is seen in the context of his other nature studies, such as his almost equally famous ''Meadow'' or his ''Bird Wings''. He chose to paint these in watercolor or [[gouache]], striving for the highest possible precision and "realistic" representation.

The hare pictured by DÃ¼rer probably does not have a symbolic meaning, but it does have an exceptional reception history. Reproductions of DÃ¼rer's ''Hare'' have often been a permanent component of [[bourgeois]] living rooms in Germany. The image has been printed in textbooks; published in countless reproductions; embossed in copper, wood or stone; represented three-dimensionally in plastic or plaster; encased in [[plexiglas]]; painted on ostrich eggs; printed on plastic bags; surreally distorted in ''Hasengiraffe'' ("Haregiraffe") by Martin Missfeldt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martin-missfeldt.de/kunst-bilder/albrecht-duerer/hase-albrecht-duerer.php|title=Hase nach Albrecht DÃ¼rer|website=www.martin-missfeldt.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; reproduced as a joke by [[Fluxus]] artists;{{r|fluxus}} and cast in gold; or sold cheaply in [[art galleries|galleries]] and at [[art fairs]]

Since early 2000, [[Ottmar HÃ¶rl]] has created several works based on DÃ¼rer's ''Hare,'' including a giant pink version.&lt;ref name="HÃ¶rlâs Pink Hare"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smyth|first1=Debbie|title=Pink Rabbit!|url=https://travelwithintent.com/2015/03/26/pink-rabbit-young-hare-vienna/|website=Travel with Intent|accessdate=8 March 2018|date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmar Polke]] has also engaged with the hare on paper or textiles, or as part of his installations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum-frieder-burda.de/1.328.2.html?&amp;shadow=79&amp;cHash=93690b7a29|title=Illustration, Gouache on patterned fabric|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even in rubber band form.&lt;ref name="Poke rubber band"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Butler|first1=Sharon|title=More on Prince, Polke, and rubber bands|url=http://www.twocoatsofpaint.com/2012/06/more-on-prince-polke-and-rubber-bands.html|website=Two Coats of Paint|accessdate=8 March 2018|date=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dieter Roth]]'s ''KÃ¶ttelkarnikel'' ("Turd Bunny") is a copy of DÃ¼rer's ''Hare'' made from rabbit droppings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leben.freenet.de/pictureshow/reisen/multimedial-kuenstler-roth_799796_533042_779680_6.html|title=Multimedial: KÃ¼nstler Roth|website=leben.freenet.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Klaus Staeck]] enclosed one in a little wooden box, with a cutout hole, so that it could look out and breathe. DÃ¼rer's ''Hare'' has even inspired a depiction of the mythological [[Wolpertinger]].

The '''Royal Entry''', also known by various names, including '''Triumphal Entry''', [[Joyous Entry]], consisted of the ceremonies and festivities accompanying a formal entry by a ruler or his representative into a city in the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Early Modern Period]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Of course other cultures had equivalents, often even more spectacular, especially [[China]] and [[India]].&lt;/ref&gt; The entry centred on a procession carrying the entering prince into the city, where he was greeted and paid appropriate homage by the civic authorities. A feast and other celebrations would follow.

The Entry began as a gesture of loyalty and fealty by a city to the ruler, with its origins in the ''[[Adventus (ceremony)|adventus]]'' celebrated for Roman emperors, which were formal entries far more frequent than [[Roman triumph|triumph]]s. The first visit by a new ruler was normally the occasion, or the first visit with a new spouse. For the capital they often merged with the [[Coronation]] festivities, and for provincial cities they replaced it, sometimes as part of a '''Royal Progress''', or tour of major cities in a realm. (See also [[Itinerant court]], about this.)

From the [[late Middle Ages]]&lt;ref&gt;Earlier transformations of the [[Roman triumph]] in Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages have been discussed by Michael McCormick, ''Eternal Victory: Triumphal Rulership in Late Antiquity, Byzantium and the Early Medieval West'' (Cambridge University Press) 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; entries became the occasion for increasingly lavish displays of [[Medieval pageant|pageant]]ry and [[propaganda]]. The devising of the [[iconography]], aside from highly conventional patterns into which it quickly settled,&lt;ref&gt;"A remarkably consistent visual and iconographical vocabulary" according to Roy Strong.&lt;/ref&gt; was managed with scrupulous care on the part of the welcoming city by municipal leaders in collaboration with the chapter of the cathedral, the university, or hired specialists. Often the greatest artists, writers and composers of the period were involved in the creation of temporary decorations, of which little record now survives, at least from the early period.

==Origins and development==
[[File:Taddeo Zuccari 003.jpg|thumb|left|250px|King [[Francis I of France]], [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V|Charles V]], and [[Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)|Cardinal Alessandro Farnese]] enter Paris under a [[Baldachin|canopy of estate]] in 1540, in a fresco by [[Taddeo Zuccari]].]]

The contemporary account from [[Galbert of Bruges]] of the unadorned  "Joyous Advent" of a newly installed [[Count of Flanders]] into "his" city of Bruges, in April 1127, shows that in  the initial stage, undisguised by fawning and triumphalist imagery that came to disguise it, an Entry was similar to a [[parley]], a formal truce between the rival powers of territorial magnate and walled city, in which reiteration of the city's "liberties" in the medieval sense, that is its rights and prerogatives, were set out in clear terms and legitimated by the presence of [[Relic|saintly relics]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"On April 5... at twilight, the king with the newly elected [[william of Ypres|Count William, marquis of Flanders]], came into our town at Bruges. The canons of [[St. Donatian's Cathedral|Saint Donatian]] had come forth to meet them, bearing relics of the saints and welcoming the king and new count joyfully in a solemn procession worthy of a king. On April 6... the king and count assembled with their knights and ours, with the citizens and many Flemings in the usual field where [[Reliquary|reliquaries]] and relics of the saints had been collected. And when silence had been called for, the charter of the liberty of the church and of the privileges of Saint Donatian was read aloud before all... There was also read the little charter of agreement between the count and our citizens... Binding themselves to accept this condition, the king and count took an oath on the relics of saints in the hearing of the clergy and people".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in James M. Murray, "the Liturgy of the Count's Advent in Bruges", ''City and Spectacle in Medieval Europe'', Barbara Hanawalt and Kathryn Reyerson, eds., 1994, p. 137; Murray compares this "political bargain" with a contemporary account of the similar ''Adventus Iocundus'' of April 1384.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The procession of a new Pope to Rome was known as a ''possesso''.  A ruler with a new spouse would also receive an Entry. The entry of Queen [[Isabeau of Bavaria]] into Paris in 1389 was described by the chronicler [[Froissart]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Ribemont, "L'entree d'Isabeau de BaviÃ¨re Ã  Paris: une fete textuelle pour Froissart," in ''Feste und Feiern'', pp. 515â24.&lt;/ref&gt; The Entries of [[Charles IX of France]] and his Habsburg queen, [[Elisabeth of Austria (1554â1592)|Elizabeth of Austria]], into Paris, March 1571, had been scheduled for Charles alone in 1561, for the ''entrate'' were typically celebrated towards the beginning of a reign,&lt;ref&gt;The entries made by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand of Aragon]] late in his reign, at Naples (1506), Valencia (1507), Seville (1508) and Valladolid (1509 and 1513), serve as exceptions that were occasioned by his need for confirmative propaganda, following the arrival in Castile of Philip that resolved the succession crisis attendant on the death of Isabella, and Ferdinand's withdrawal into Aragon. (Tess Knighton and Carmen Morte GarcÃ­a, "Ferdinand of Aragon's Entry into Valladolid in 1513: The Triumph of a Christian King" ''Early Music History'' '''18''' (1999:119â163) p. 123.)&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[French Wars of Religion]] had made such festivities inappropriate, until the peace that followed the Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye signed in August 1570.&lt;ref name="Victor E 1975"&gt;Victor E. Graham and W. McAllister Johnson, ''The Paris Entries of Charles IX and Elizabeth of Austria 1571'' (University of Toronto Press) 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the mid-14th century, the occasions were relatively simple.  The city authorities waited for the prince and his party outside the city walls, and after handing over a ceremonial key&lt;ref&gt;Lingering into modern times is the ceremonial presentation of the "[[Freedom of the city|key to the city]]" to an honoured guest.&lt;/ref&gt; with a "loyal address" or speech,&lt;ref&gt;At Charles V's entry into Genoa in 1533, a twelve-year-old girl, dressed as Victory and carrying a palm frond, delivered a suitable oration ''all'antica''â in Latin. (George L. Gorse, "An Unpublished Description of the Villa Doria in Genoa during Charles V's Entry, 1533" ''The Art Bulletin'' '''68'''.2 [June 1986:319â322]).&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps stopping to admire ''[[Tableau vivant|tableaux vivants]]'' such as those that were performed at the entry into Paris of Queen [[Isabeau of Bavaria]], described in detail by the chronicler [[Froissart]], conducted him through the streets which were transformed with colour, with houses on the route hanging tapestries and embroideries&lt;ref&gt;The richly worked hangings of a bed would serve.&lt;/ref&gt; or carpets&lt;ref&gt;Pile carpets were displayed on tables or on a dais; pile carpets were not usually trod under foot until the seventeenth century.&lt;/ref&gt; or bolts of cloth from their windows, and with most of the population lining the route.   At Valladolid in 1509
:''the town was so gay, so decked out in wealth and canopies and luxurious carpets, that not even Florence or Venice could match it. All the beautiful ladies were delighted to be on display and were definitely worth seeing, [and] everything was so brilliantly arrayed, that I, who am of the town and have never left it, could not recognize it.''&lt;ref&gt;LuÃ­s de Soto, chaplain of the king and coordinator of the Entry, quoted in Knighton and Morte GarcÃ­a 1999:139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heraldic displays were ubiquitous: at Valladolid in 1509, the bulls in the fields outside the city were caparisoned with cloths painted with the royal arms and hung with bells.  Along the route the procession would repeatedly halt to admire the set-pieces embellished with [[motto]]es and pictured and living allegories, accompanied by declamations and the blare of trumpets&lt;ref&gt;At Valladolid in 1513 Ferdinand was welcomed with four pairs of [[kettledrums]], trumpets by the dozens, [[shawm]]s and [[sackbut]]s. "They made such a din that if a bird happened to fly past, they made it fall from the sky into the crowd", the chroncicler records. (Knighton and Morte Garcia 1999:125).&lt;/ref&gt; and volleys of artillery. The procession would include members of the [[three Estates]], with the nobility and gentry of the surrounding area, and the clergy and [[guild]]s of the city processing behind the prince.  From the mid-14th century the guild members often wore special uniform clothes, each guild choosing a bright colour; in [[Tournai]] in 1464 three hundred men wore large embroidered silk [[fleur de lys]] (the royal badge) on their chests and backs, at their own expense.&lt;ref&gt;FranÃ§oise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; ''Dress in the Middle Ages''; pp. 150â151, Yale UP, 1997; {{ISBN|0-300-06906-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The prince reciprocated by confirming, and sometimes extending, the customary privileges of the city or a local area of which it was the capital.  Usually the prince also visited the cathedral to be received by the bishop and confirm the privileges of the [[cathedral chapter]] also.&lt;ref name="Strong, 1984, p. 7"&gt;Strong, 1984, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; There a ''[[Te Deum]]'' would be customary, and music written for the occasion would be performed.

===Increasing elaboration===
[[File:EntrÃ©e de Charles V Ã  Paris.jpg|thumb|[[Charles V of France]] enters Paris after his coronation at Rheims in 1364. Later depiction by [[Jean Fouquet]].]]
During the 14th century, as courtly culture, with the court of Burgundy in the lead,&lt;ref&gt;The refinements of court protocol and the magnificence of court entertainments of [[Philip the Good]] and [[Charles the Bold]] set courtly fashions for decades in the fifteenth century.&lt;/ref&gt; began to stage elaborate dramas re-enacting battles or legends as entertainment during feasts, the cities began to include in entry ceremonies small staged pageant "tableaux", usually organised by the guilds (and any communities of foreign merchants resident), and drawing on their growing experience of [[medieval theatre]] and [[medieval pageant|pageantry]].  Initially these were on religious themes, but "gradually these tableaux developed, through the fifteenth and into the sixteenth century, into a repertory of archways and street-theatres which presented variants of a remarkably consistent visual and iconographical vocabulary."&lt;ref name="Strong, 1984, p. 7"/&gt;  Fortune with her wheel, Fame and Time, the seven Virtues, both Christian and Classical, and the [[Nine Worthies]] and other Classical, Biblical and local heroes,&lt;ref&gt;At [[York]] in 1486 [[Henry VII of England]] was presented with the keys to the city by the mayor and the allegorical founder-figure of ''Eburak'', a phantom king conjured up by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s 12th-century [[The History of the Kings of Britain|history of the kings of Britain]] and embedded in civic cult (Gareth Dean, ''Medieval York'' 2008:50).&lt;/ref&gt; among whose number the honoree was now to be counted. As the tradition developed, the themes became more specific, firstly stressing the legitimacy of the prince, and his claim by descent, then setting before him the princely virtues and their rewards, which especially included the benefits to him of encouraging prosperous cities and provinces.

The procession might pause for allegorical figures to address it, or pass beside a [[family tree|genealogical tree]] or under a temporary classical-style [[triumphal arch]] with either painted figures or posed actors perching on it, standing in for statuary in the case of arches. Still more elaborate entertainments began to be staged during or after the civic feast, and by the mid-17th century these could be as spectacular as the staged naval battles, [[masque]]s, [[opera]]s and [[ballet]]s that courts staged for themselves.  The court now often had a major role in both designing and financing entries, which increasingly devoted themselves to the glorification of the [[absolute monarch]] as hero, and left the old emphasis on his obligations behind; "any lingering possibilities of its use as a vehicle for dialogue with the middle classes vanished".&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; At the third "triumph" at Valladolid  in 1509, a lion holding the city's coat-of-arms shattered at the King's arrival, revealing the royal arms: the significance could not have been lost, even on those unable to hear the accompanying declamation.&lt;ref&gt;Knighton and Morte GarcÃ­a 1999:146&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 16th century, at dates differing widely by location, the [[tableau vivant]] was phased out and mostly replaced by painted or sculpted images, although many elements of street-theatre persisted, and small [[masque]]s or other displays became incorporated into the programmes.  The entry in 1514 of [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary Tudor]] to Paris, as Louis XII's new Queen, was the first French entry to have a single organizer; ten years before [[Anne of Brittany]]'s entry had been "largely medieval", with five stops for [[mystery play]]s in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;One Pierre Gringore, apparently appointed by the government. Baumgartner, Frederick J; ''Louis XII'', pp. 136 (Anne) and 240 (Mary), Alan Sutton Publishing Ltd, Stroud, 1994, {{ISBN|0-7509-0695-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Hundred Years' War]], the entry of the ten-year-old [[Henry VI of England]], to be crowned king of France in Paris, 2 December 1431, was marked with great pomp and heraldic propaganda. Outside the city he was welcomed by the mayor in a blue velvet ''[[houppelande]]'', his retinue in violet with scarlet caps, and representatives of the [[Parlement de Paris]] in red trimmed with fur. At the porte Saint-Denis the royal party were greeted with a grand achievement of the French arms that Henry claimed, gold [[Fleur de lis|fleurs de lis]] on an azure ground. The king was offered large red hearts, from which doves were released, and a rain of flowers pelted the procession. At the symbolic gateway, a [[canopy of estate]] embroidered with more gold lilies was erected over the young king, who was carried in a litter supported on six lances carried by men dressed in blue. Through the city there were welcoming pageants and allegorical performances: before the Church of the Innocents, a forest was erected, through which a captured stag was released and "hunted".&lt;ref&gt;The contemporary sources, including''The Chronicles of [[Enguerrand de Monstrelet]]'' (Thomas Johnes, tr., London 1810, vol. vii, p. 46ff) and the ''Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris'', are noted in the brief description in Walter Franz Schirmer, ''John Lydgate: a study in the culture of the XVth century'' 1979, p. 137; [[John Lydgate|Lydgate]] was called upon to provide texts for similar pageantry at home, such as the entry of Henry into London, 1434.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical influence===
[[File:Triunphus Caesaris plate 9 - Andreani.jpg|left|thumb|Later woodcut after [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], with hand-colouring, showing the culmination of the [[Triumphs of Caesar]].]]
Educated folk of the Middle Ages had close at hand an example of an allegorical series of entries at a wedding, in the frame story that opens [[Martianus Capella]]'s encyclopedic introduction to all one needed to know of the arts, ''On the Wedding of Philology and Mercury and of the Seven Liberal Arts.''  With the revival of Classical learning, Italian entries&lt;ref&gt;The bibliography of Italian Renaissance ''entrate'' is Bonner Mitchell, ''Italian Civic Pageantry of the High Renaissance: A Descriptive Bibliography of Triumphal Entries and Selected Other Festivals for State Occasions'' (Florence) 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; became influenced by literary descriptions of the [[Roman triumph]]. [[Livy]]'s account was supplemented by detailed descriptions in [[Suetonius]] and [[Cassius Dio]] of Nero's Greek Triumph,&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Nero'' 25; Cassius Dio lxiii.20.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Josephus]] of the Triumph of Titus.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Jewish Wars'' vii. 4â6.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recherchÃ© sources were brought to bear; [[Aulus Gellius]]' ''Noctes Atticae'' furnished a detail that became part of the conventional symbolism: coronation with seven crowns. [[Boccaccio]]'s long poem ''Amorosa visione'' (1342â43), following the schema of a triumph, offered a parade of famous personages, both historical and legendary, that may have provided a model for [[Petrarch]], who elaborated upon Livy in an account of the triumph of [[Scipio Africanus]] and in his poem ''[[I Trionfi]]''.  [[Castruccio Castracani]] entered [[Lucca]] in 1326 riding in a chariot, with prisoners driven before him.  [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] entered [[Naples]] in 1443 seated on a triumphal car under a [[baldachin]], as is shown by a surviving [[bas-relief]]&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984, p. 44 [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:NapoliMaschioAngioinoArcoLaurana3.jpg Picture of relief]&lt;/ref&gt; on the earliest, and still perhaps the most beautiful, permanent post-classical [[Triumphal arch]], which he built the same year.&lt;ref&gt;George L. Hersey, ''The Aragonese Arch at Naples, 1443â1475'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1973) summarises the scholarship on the Arch and reports eye-witness accounts of the Entry and pictorial illustrations.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Italian, specific meanings developed for ''trionfo'' as both the whole procession, and a particular car or cart decorated with a display or tableau; although these usages did not spread exactly to other languages, they lie behind terms such as "triumphal entry" and "triumphal procession".

The emphasis began to shift from the displays as static tableaux that were passed by a procession in festive but normal contemporary dress, to the displays' being incorporated in the procession itself, a feature also of the religious [[medieval pageant]]; the tableaux were mounted on ''carri'', the precursors of the float, and were now often accompanied by a costumed throng. The [[carnival]] parades of Florence that were refined to a high pitch in the late quattrocento set a high standard; they were not without a propaganda element at times, as in the lavish parades of Carnival 1513, following the not-universally welcomed return of the Medici the previous year; the theme of one pageant, more direct than subtle: ''The Return of the Golden Age''.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; With the French invasions of Italy from 1494, this form of entry spread north. Cardinal Bibbiena reported in a letter of 1520 that the Duke of Suffolk had sent emissaries to Italy to buy horses and bring back to [[Henry VIII of England]] men who knew how to make festal decorations in the latest Italian manner.&lt;ref&gt;John Shearman, "The Florentine Entrata of Leo X, 1515" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''38''' (1975:136â154) p. 136.

[[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V|Charles V]] was indulged in a series of Imperial ''entrate'' in Italian cities during the Habsburg consolidation after the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]], notably in Genoa, where Charles and his heir Philip made no less than five triumphal entries.&lt;ref&gt;In 1529, 1533, 1536, 1542 and 1548. (J. Jacquot, ed., ''Les fÃªtes de la Renaissance'' II: ''FÃªtes et cÃ©rÃ©monies au temps de Charles-Quint'', Paris 1960).&lt;/ref&gt; Impressive occasions like Charles V's Royal Entry into Messina in 1535 have left few concrete survivals,&lt;ref&gt;Sheila ffoliot&lt;!--ffoliot is correct--&gt; argues convincingly in ''Civic Sculpture in the Renaissance: Montorsoli's Fountains at Messina'' (Studies in Renaissance History, Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1984) that many features of [[Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli]]'s Fountain of Orion in Messina, which survives in much degraded condition, owe their origins to the programme for the Entry of 1535.&lt;/ref&gt;  but representations were still being painted on Sicilian wedding-carts in the 19th century.

After [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s great mural of the [[Triumphs of Caesar]] rapidly became known throughout Europe in numerous versions in [[old master print|print]] form, this became the standard source, from which details were frequently borrowed, not least by Habsburg rulers, who especially claimed the Imperial legacy of Rome.  Although Mantegna's elephants were difficult to copy,&lt;ref&gt;Oxen were disguised as elephants to draw one of the floats in the carnival parade given by Lorenzo di Piero de' Medici's fraternal company, the ''Broncone'', at Florence, 6 February 1513. (John Shearman, "Pontormo and Andrea Del Sarto, 1513" ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''104''' No. 716 [November 1962:450, 478-483] p. 478.).&lt;/ref&gt; chained captives, real or acting the part, were not, and elaborate triumphal carts, often pulled by "[[unicorn]]s" might replace the earlier canopy held over the prince on horseback.  The [[woodcut]]s and text of the ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'' of 1499 were another well-known source, and Petrarch's ''I Trionfi'' was printed in many illustrated editions; both were works of mythological allegory, with no obvious political content.  Entries became displays of conspicuous learning, often with lengthy Latin addresses, and the entertainments became infused with matter from the abstruse worlds of Renaissance [[emblem]]s and [[hermeticism]], to which they were very well suited.  In the world of Renaissance [[Neo-Platonism]], the assertion and acting-out of the glory and power of the prince might actually bring it about.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984:40â41.&lt;/ref&gt;

A precocious example of the Entrata with a consistent and unified allegorical theme was the Entry of [[Pope Leo X|Medici pope Leo X]] into Florence, November 1515.&lt;ref&gt;Singled out by AndrÃ© Chastel, "Le lieu de la fÃªte", in J. Jacquot, ed. ''FÃªtes de la Renaissance'' (Paris 1956, vol. I:420), and described at length by John Shearman, "The Florentine Entrata of Leo X, 1515" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''38''' (1975:136â154), from whose account these details are drawn.&lt;/ref&gt; All the city's artistic resources were drawn upon to create this exemplary Entry, to a planned programme perhaps devised by the historian [[Jacopo Nardi]], as [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] suggested; the Seven Virtues represented by seven triumphal arches at stations along the route, the seventh applied as a temporary faÃ§ade to the [[Florence Cathedral|Duomo, Santa Maria del Fiore]], which still lacked a permanent one.

===Propaganda===
Apart from the permanent theme of the reciprocal bonds uniting ruler and ruled, in times of political tension the political messages in Entries became more pointed and emphatic.  A disputed succession would produce a greater stress on the theme of legitimacy.  After the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], tension became a permanent condition, and most Entries contained a sectarian element.  After about 1540 French entries and Habsburg ones in the [[Low Countries]]&lt;ref&gt;The bibliography is John Landwehr, ''Splendid Ceremonies: State Entries and Royal Funerals in the Low Countries, 1550â1791: A Bibliography'' (Leiden 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; were especially freighted with implication, as the rulers' attempts to suppress Protestantism brought Protestant and Catholic populations alike to the edge of ruin.  But initially this increased the scale of displays, whose message was now carefully controlled by the court.
[[File:Pieter Paul Rubens - Ingresso trionfale di Enrico IV a Parigi - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''Entry of Henry IV into Paris'', by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], 1628â30: an unfinished [[Baroque]] figuration of the allegory itself.]]

This transformation happened much earlier in Italy than in the North, and a succession of entries for Spanish Viceroys to the blockaded city of [[Antwerp]], once the richest in Northern Europe and now in steep decline, were "used by the city fathers to combine increasingly eulogistic celebrations of their Habsburg rulers with tableaux to remind them of the commercial ruin over which they presided."&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Pompa Introitus'' of the [[Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand]] into Antwerp in 1635, devised by [[Gaspar Gevartius]] and carried out under the direction of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], was made unmistakably pointed, and included [http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/pageview.aspx?strFest=0152&amp;strPage=220 a representation] of the god of commerce, [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], flying away, as a lamenting figure representing Antwerp points at him and looks imploringly out at the Viceroy, whilst beside her lie a sleeping sailor and a river god, representing the wrecked trade of the city from the blockading of the river [[Scheldt]].  Eventually the Viceroy managed to obtain the lifting of the ban on trade with the [[Indies]] which the entry had represented as Antwerp's only hope of escaping ruin; but by then the Spanish had agreed to the permanent blockade of the river.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Triomphe de Josaphat.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Triumph of [[Jehoshaphat]]'', [[Jean Fouquet]], 1470â75.]]

In 1638, the occasion of the French queen mother [[Marie de Medici|Marie de Medici's]] triumphal entry into [[Amsterdam]] lent ''de facto'' international recognition of the newly formed [[Dutch Republic]], though she actually traveled to the Netherlands as an exile. Spectacular displays and water pageants took place in the city's harbor; a procession was led by two mounted [[trumpeter]]s; a large temporary structure erected on an artificial island in the [[Amstel River]] was built especially for the festival.  This building was designed to display a series of dramatic [[tableau vivant|tableaux]] in tribute to her once she set foot on the floating island and entered its [[pavilion]]. The distinguished poet and classicist [[Caspar Barlaeus]] wrote the official descriptive booklet, ''Medicea Hospes, sive descriptio publicae gratulationis, qua ... Mariam de Medicis, excepit senatus populusque Amstelodamensis''.  Published by Willem Blaeu, it includes two large folding engraved views of the ceremonies.

===Peace and war===
Although the essence of an entry was that it was supposed to be a peaceful, festive occasion, very different from the taking of a town by assault, several entries actually followed military action by the town against their ruler, and were very tense affairs.  In 1507 the population of [[Genoa]] revolted against the French who had conquered them in 1499, and restored [[Republic of Genoa|their Republic]].  [[Louis XII of France]] defeated the Genoan army outside the city, which then agreed a capitulation, including an entry which was followed by the execution of the [[Doge]] and other leaders of the revolt.  The gestural content was rather different from a peaceful entry; Louis entered in full armour, holding a naked sword, which he struck against the portal as he entered the city, saying "Proud Genoa! I have won you with my sword in my hand".&lt;ref&gt;Baumgartner, Frederick J; ''Louis XII'', pp. 185â7, Alan Sutton Publishing Ltd, Stroud, 1994, {{ISBN|0-7509-0695-2}} He had sent a small force into the city two days before, and though large fines were levied, the city was not sacked.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles V entered [[Rome]] in splendour less than three years after his army had [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked the city]].  The famously troublesome citizens of [[Ghent]] revolted against [[Philip the Good]] [[Battle of Gavere|in 1453]] and Charles V [[Revolt of Ghent (1539)|in 1539]], after which Charles arrived with a large army and was greeted with an entry.  A few weeks later he dictated the programme of a deliberately humiliating anti-festival, with the burghers coming barefoot with nooses round their necks to beg forgiveness from him which, after imposing a huge fine, he consented to do.&lt;ref&gt;Wilenski:34â35&lt;/ref&gt;  The entries of Charles and his son Philip in 1549 were followed the next year by a ferocious anti-Protestant edict that began the repression that led to the [[Dutch Revolt|Revolt of the Netherlands]], in the course of which Antwerp was to suffer a [[Sack of Antwerp|terrible sack]] in 1576 and a [[Siege of Antwerp (1584â1585)|long siege]] in 1584â85, which finally ended all prosperity in the city.

===Decline===
[[File:Triumphal Arch in Gdansk.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Temporary [[triumphal arch]] in [[GdaÅsk]] to celebrate the ceremonial entry of Queen [[Marie Louise Gonzaga]], 1646]]
During the 17th century the scale of entries began to decline.  There was a clear trend, led from [[Medici]] Florence, to transfer festivities involving the monarch into the private world of the court. The ''[[intermedio|intermezzi]]'' developed in Florence, the ''[[ballet de cour]]'' that spread from Paris, the English [[masque]], and even elaborate equestrian ballets all increased as entries declined.&lt;ref&gt;A major theme of Strong, 1984, summed up in pp. 171â3&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1628, when Marie de' Medici commissioned from Rubens a ''Triumphal Entry of Henri IV into Paris'', it was for a suite of grand decorations for her own palace,  [[Palais du Luxembourg|the Luxembourg]]; Rubens did not recreate historic details of the 1594 Royal Entry, but overleapt them to render the allegory itself (''illustration'').

The cultural atmosphere of Protestantism was less favourable to the Royal Entry. In the new Dutch Republic entries ceased altogether.  In England, part of the [[Accession Day tilt|Accession Day festivities]] in 1588, following the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] were especially joyous and solemn. Delaying the event a week to 24 November, Elizabeth rode in triumph, "imitating the ancient Romans" from her [[palace of Whitehall]] in the [[city of Westminster]] to enter the [[city of London]] at [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]]. She rode in a chariot
&lt;blockquote&gt;"made with four pillars behind, to have a canopie, on the top whereof was made a crowne imperiall, and two lower pillars before. whereon stood a [[Lion and Unicorn|lyon and a dragon]], supporters of the armes of England, drawn by two white horses"&lt;ref&gt;The quote and the description are from Roy C. Strong, "The Popular Celebration of the Accession Day of Queen Elizabeth I" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''21'''.1/2 (January 1958:86â103) pp92f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] followed the triumphal car, leading the caparisoned and riderless horse of estate, followed by the ladies of honour. The windows of houses along the procession route up the [[Strand, London|Strand]] were hung with blue cloth. At Temple Bar, the official gate to the City, there was music and the Lord Mayor handed over the mace and received it again. In a "closet" constructed for the occasion, the Queen heard a festive service celebrated by fifty clergymen at [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] and returned in a torchlit procession in the evening.

Nevertheless, the entry of James I into London in 1604 was the last until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of his grandson in 1660, after the [[English Civil War]].  The court of Charles I intensified the scale of private [[masque]]s and other entertainments, but the cities, increasingly at odds with the monarchy, would no longer play along.  The [[Duchy of Lorraine]], a great centre of all festivities, was swallowed up in the [[Thirty Years War]], which left much of Northern and Central Europe in no mood or condition for celebrations on the old scale.  In France the concentration of power in royal hands, begun by [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]], left city elites distrustful of the monarchy, and once Louis XIV succeeded to the throne, royal progresses stopped completely for over fifty years; in their place Louis staged his elaborate court [[fÃªte]]s, redolent of cultural propaganda, which were memorialised in sumptupously illustrated volumes that the ''Cabinet du Roi'' placed in all the right hands.
[[File:GeorgeIVDublin.jpg|thumb|310px|Triumphal Entry of [[George IV of the United Kingdom]] into [[Dublin]], 1821, with temporary arch]]
Changes in the intellectual climate meant the old allegories no longer resonated with the population.  The assassinations of both [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] and [[Henry IV of France]], of [[William the Silent]] and other prominent figures, and the spread of guns, made rulers more cautious about appearing in slow-moving processions planned and publicised long in advance; at grand occasions for fireworks and illuminations, rulers now characteristically did no more than show themselves at a ceremonial window or balcony.  The visit of [[Louis XVI]] to inspect the naval harbour works at [[Cherbourg]] in 1786 seems, amazingly, to have been the first French entry of a King designed as a public event since the early years of Louis XIV well over a century before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Simon Schama|Schama, Simon]] | title=[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]] | page=57| location=New York | publisher=Alfred A. Knopf | year=1989 | isbn=0-394-55948-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though considered a great success, this was certainly too little and too late to avoid the catastrophe awaiting the French monarchy.

Ideologues of the [[French Revolution]] took the semi-private fÃªte of the former court and made it public once more, in events like the ''[[FÃªte de la Raison]]''. Under Napoleon, the [[Treaty of Tolentino]] (1797) requisitioned from the Papacy a mass of works of art, including most of the famous sculptures of Roman antiquity in the Vatican. A Joyous Entry under the name of a fÃªte was arranged for the arrival of the cultural loot in Paris, the carefully prepared ''FÃªte de la LibertÃ©'' of 1798. With the increased sense of public security of the 19th century, Entries became grander again, on such occasions as the [[Visit of King George IV to Scotland]], where medieval revivalism makes its first appearance, along with much [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] romanticism, Queen Victoria's visits to Dublin and elsewhere, or the three [[Delhi Durbar]]s. On these occasions, though ceremonial acts remained meaningful, overt allegories never regained the old prominence, and the decorations receded into festive, but simply decorative affairs of flags, flowers and [[bunting (textile)|bunting]], the last remnant of the medieval show of rich textiles along the processional route.

Today, though many [[parade]]s and [[procession]]s have quite separate, independent origins, civic or republican equivalents of the Entry continue. They include [[Victory parade]]s, New York's traditional [[ticker-tape parade]]s and the [[Lord Mayor's Show]] in London, dating back to 1215 and still preserving the Renaissance car, or [[Float (parade)|float]] model. It is not frivolous to add that the specific occasion of the contemporary American [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade|Thanksgiving Day Parade]] or the [[Santa Claus parade]] is the triumphal entry into the city of [[Santa Claus]] in his sleigh.

===Artists===
[[File:HenriIIbetweenFrance&amp;Fame.jpg|thumb|240px|left|''[[Henry II of France]] between France and Fame'', [[engraving]] by [[Jean Duvet]],  may reflect a tableau from an occasion such as his Entry into Paris, 16 June 1549.]]
To the occasional irritation of modern [[art historian]]s, many of the great artists of the time spent a good deal of time on the ephemeral decorations for entries and other festivities, including [[Jan van Eyck]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Albrecht DÃ¼rer]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], [[Andrea del Sarto]], [[Perino del Vaga]],&lt;ref&gt;His frescoes for [[Villa del Principe]], executed in expectation of Charles V's ''entrata'' of 1533, bear witness to the vanished theme of the event: Neptune and the defeat of the Giants.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polidoro da Caravaggio]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]  and [[Rubens]].  For some court artists, such as [[Inigo Jones]] or [[Jacques Bellange]], it seems to have been their major occupation, and both [[Giulio Romano]] and [[Giorgio Vasari]] were very heavily engaged in such work.  Composers from [[Lassus]] and [[Monteverdi]] to [[John Dowland]], and writers such as [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]], [[Ronsard]], [[Ben Jonson]] and [[John Dryden|Dryden]] also contributed.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1983, p. 6 for most of these.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shakespeare]] does not seem to have written anything for such an occasion, but with Jonson he was one of a group of twenty gentlemen processing in ''The Magnificent Entertainment'', as the published record called the first entry of [[James I of England]] into London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0238 Festival Book]&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historians also detect the influence of the tableau in many paintings, especially in the late Middle Ages, before artists had trained themselves to be able to develop new compositions readily.&lt;ref&gt;Many of the best known examples, like the [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)]] or the large ''Virgin of Einsiedeln'' by [[Master E.S]] relate to tableaus not from entries, but engravings by [[Jean Duvet]], who worked on at least two royal entries, may well do.&lt;/ref&gt;   In the Renaissance, artists were often imported from other cities to help with, or supervise, the works, and entries probably helped the dissemination of styles.

===Festival books===
A [[festival book]] is an account of festivities such as entries, of which there are many hundreds, often surviving in very few copies.  Originally manuscripts, often illustrated, compiled for prince or city, with the arrival of print they were frequently published, varying in form from short pamphlets describing the order of events, and perhaps recording speeches, to lavish books illustrated with [[woodcut]]s or [[engraving]]s showing the various tableaux, often including a fold-out panorama of the procession, curling to and fro across the page. The pamphlets were ephemera themselves; a printed description of two leaves describing the entry of Ferdinand into Valladolid, 1513, survives in a single copy (at Harvard) because it was bound with another text. A lost description of the ceremonious reception given by Louis XII to Ferdinand at Savona (June 1507) is only known from a purchase receipt of [[Ferdinand Columbus]].&lt;ref&gt;Knighton and Morte Garcia 1999:120f.&lt;/ref&gt;

These ''livrets'' are not always to be trusted as literal records; some were compiled beforehand from the plans, and others after the event from fading memories. The authors or artists engaged in producing the books had by no means always seen the entry themselves.  Roy Strong finds that they are "an idealization of an event, often quite distant from its reality as experienced by the average onlooker. One of the objects of such publications was to reinforce by means of word and image the central ideas that motivated those who conceived the programme."&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984:47.&lt;/ref&gt;    One Habsburg entry was all but called off because of torrential rain, but the book shows it as it should have been.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip II into Antwerp in 1549 [http://www.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/habsburg.html British Library]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]], the playwright and author of the book on ''The Magnificent Entertainment'' for James I is refreshingly frank:
:''Reader, you must understand, that a regard, being had&lt;!--comma here instead?--&gt; that his Majestie should not be wearied with teadious speeches; A great part of those which are in this Booke set downe, were left unspoken; So that thou doest here receive them as they should have been delivered, not as they were.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/pageview.aspx?strFest=0238&amp;strPage=69 British Library online book]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ehrenpforte.kol.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of top (about 1/10 of the height) of the ''Triumphal Arch'' of Maximilian, coloured [[woodcut]], overall design by [[Albrecht DÃ¼rer]].]]
The [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian I]], went a step further, creating enormous virtual triumphs that existed solely in the form of print. The ''[[Triumphs of Maximilian]]'' (begun in 1512 and unfinished at Maximilian's death in 1519) contains over 130 large woodcuts by DÃ¼rer and other artists, showing a huge procession (still in open country) culminating in the Emperor himself, mounted on a huge car.  ''[[The Triumphal Arch]]'' (1515), the largest print ever made, at 3.57 x 2.95 metres when the 192 sheets are assembled, was produced in an edition of seven hundred copies for distribution to friendly cities and princes. It was intended to be hand-coloured and then pasted to a wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aic.stanford.edu/sg/bpg/annual/v14/bp14-07.html The American Institute for Conservation]; Figure 9 (and many later ones) show the Triumphal Car of Maximilian, and Figure 10 is the first appearance of the Arch&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional tableau themes, including a large genealogy, and many figures of Virtues, are complemented by scenes of Maximilian's life and military victories.&lt;ref&gt;For all on DÃ¼rer's involvement: Giulia Bartrum, ''Albrecht DÃ¼rer and his Legacy'', (British Museum Press), 2002:194â7, {{ISBN|0-7141-2633-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maximilian was wary of entries in person, having been locked up by his loyal subjects in [[Bruges]] in 1488 for eleven weeks, until he could pay the bills from his stay.&lt;ref&gt;A move the burghers were to regret when his son Charles V later took family revenge with an especially tough siege&lt;/ref&gt;

An early meeting between the festival book with travel literature is the [http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0097 account] of the visit in 1530 of the future [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]], then [[King of Hungary]] and [[Bohemia]] to [[Constantinople]].

===New World entries===
In Habsburg territories in the New World, the ''entradas'' of the [[Viceroy of Mexico]] were celebrated at his landing at [[Veracruz]] and at [[Mexico City]]; on the way, the ceremonial entry at the "second city", [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla de los Ãngeles]], which were presented as late as 1696, served to promote an elite that self-identified strongly with Spain, and incurred expenses, which were borrowed from the ecclesiastic ''[[Cabildo (council)|cabildo]]'', that exceeded the annual income of the city. Printed commemorative pamphlets spelled out in detail the elaborately artificial allegories and hieroglyphic emblems&lt;ref&gt;Emblems were especially drawn from the much-reprinted and translated standard [[emblem book]]s of [[Andrea Alciati]] and [[Cesare Ripa]], which engendered a considerable Spanish emblem literature during the seventeenth century.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Entry, often drawn from astrology, in which the Viceroy would illuminate the city as the sun. In the 18th century, the Bourbon transformation of ''entrÃ©es'' into semi-private ''fÃªtes'' extended to Spanish Mexico: "While the event continued to be extravagant under Bourbon rule, it became more privatized and took place to a larger degree indoors, losing its street theater flavor and urban processional character."&lt;ref&gt;Nancy H. Fee, "La Entrada Angelopolitana: Ritual and Myth in the Viceregal Entry in Puebla de Los Angeles" ''The Americas'' '''52'''.3 (January 1996), pp. 283â320.&lt;/ref&gt;

*1356: the [[Joyous Entry]] into [[Brussels]], by [[Joanna, Duchess of Brabant|Joanna]] and her husband [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Luxembourg]], upon her becoming Duchess of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]].  "Joyous Entry" is a common term for French or [[Netherlandish]] entries.  This one is famous because the [[Charter]] granted by the ruler to the Duchy came to assume a position in the history of the Low countries similar to that of the [[Magna Carta]] in England.
*1431: [[Henry VI of England]] returned to London after being crowned [[King of France]] in [[Paris]], then occupied by the English, and the arms of both crowns were prominently displayed.  Henry, then aged fifteen, was encountered by the "empresses" of "Nature, Grace and Fortune" who destowed various virtues and talents upon, then by fourteen maidens, representing the [[Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit]] and a further set.  After further tableaux, at [[Cheapside]] a fountain ran with wine (a particular speciality of London festivities) and large tableaux represented the genealogy of the King, and a complementary [[Tree of Jesse]] showing that of Christ. The finale was a huge tableau of Heaven, where God the Father, surrounded by saints and angels, addressed the King.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984, pp. 8â9&lt;/ref&gt;
*1443: [[Alfonso V of Aragon]]'s triumphal entry into Naples was "the earliest of the triumphal entries ''all'antica'' in Europe"&lt;ref&gt;Knighton and Morte GarcÃ­a 1999:124, referencing C. Carandete, ''I triunfi nel primo rinascimento''  (Edizioni Rai 1963:20).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most lathe-and-plaster painted triumphal arches, its permanent commemoration is the arch before the [[Castel Nuovo]]. The event, portraying Alfonso as a classical hero of Antiquity, set iconographic examples for his nephew in the Royal entries of Ferdinand of Aragon. The published account by [[Antonio Beccadelli (poet)|Antonio Beccadelli, "Il Panormita"]], circulated widely.

*1515: The triumphal entry of the [[Pope Leo X|Medici Pope Leo X]] into Florence is one of the most thoroughly documented entries, both in official records and private journalsâ though the visual and musical components are lostâ and has attracted a separate monograph, by Ilaria Ciseri.&lt;ref&gt;Ilaria Ciseri, ''L'ingresso trionfale di Leone X in Firenze nel 1515'' (Biblioteca Storica Toscana (Florence: Olschki) 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced on a princely scale, catching Leo at the peak of his reputation, en route to a meeting at Bologna with FranÃ§ois I, at the head of temporarily victorious forces. Ciseri identifies two likely candidates for the allegorical programme, Jacopo Nardi and Marcello Virgilio Adriani, and a theme that offered parallel evocations of Imperial Rome the heavenly Jerusalem. The unfinished faÃ§ade of the Duomo was temporarily "completed" in "[[chiaroscuro]]" ([[grisaille]]) canvases of feigned architecture and sculpture by [[Andrea del Sarto]] to designs by [[Jacopo Sansovino]].&lt;ref&gt;Shearman 1962:480&lt;/ref&gt;

A [http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0231 much less elaborate] affair than Habsburg entries, but at least for the Protestant population, one more genuinely celebrated.  There is a typical English emphasis on poems and orations, of which the majority were given by children.  Elizabeth processed in a triumphal "Chariot", was presented with a bible by the city, and passed giant figures re-used from the wedding of her sister Mary.  Both speeches and tableaus depicted her as saviour of the Protestant faith, a new [[Deborah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0231 Festival Book]&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1578 entry into [[Norwich]] is [http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0232 almost homely]; the master of the [[grammar school]] being apparently the only townsman whose Latin was fit to put before the Queen, he catches her up and orates at several points.
*1571: The separate Entries of [[Charles IX of France]] and his new Habsburg queen, [[Elisabeth of Austria (1554â1592)|Elizabeth of Austria]], into Paris, 6 March and 29, were recorded in a book of woodcuts with text, Simon Bouquet's ''Bref et sommaire receuil...'', published in July. Bouquet, an alderman of Paris, was responsible for coordinating the details. Poets [[Jean Dorat]] and [[Pierre Ronsard]] drew up the iconographic program, and [[Germain Pilon]] executed temporary allegorical sculpture, and [[Niccolo dell'Abate]] provided paintings. The main theme was the inauguration of a new era of peace: Charles' personal motto, ''Piety and Justice'' furnished the allegory presented at one of the cortege's stops. A little over a year later the [[Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre]]s inaugurated a new phase of the wars.&lt;ref name="Victor E 1975"/&gt;
*1574: The new King [[Henry III of France]] on his way back from his brief period as [[King of Poland]] was given an exceptionally grand Entry to [[Venice]], which rarely had the opportunity of welcoming a friendly monarch, though it had its own very lavish round of festivities. This was a "State Visit" with no element of accepting fealty.  Tintoretto and Veronese collaborated in painting an arch designed by [[Palladio]], and for the banquet for 3,000 in the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]], statuettes in [[sugar]] designed by Jacopo Sansovino decorated the tables.&lt;ref&gt;R.H.

*1583: The [[French Fury]] was a disastrously unsuccessful attempt by [[FranÃ§ois, Duke of Anjou]] to use the excuse of an entry to take [[Antwerp]] â the citizens were forewarned and attacked the army as it marched through the streets, sending it running.  They had already been sacked in the [[Sack of Antwerp|Spanish Fury]] in 1576, with the sack of Rome in 1527, among the most notorious anti-entries of the period.
*1589: The triumphal entry of [[Christina of Lorraine]] at Florence and her wedding procession with [[Ferdinand I de' Medici]], complete with ephemeral triumphal arches, included â interspersed with public shows, a game of ''[[Football in Italy|calcio]]'', animal-baiting, a staged [[jousting|joust]] in Piazza Santa Croce â semi-private court events, the musical ''[[intermedio|intermedi]]'' that were presented in the newly redesigned theatre in the [[Uffizi]]; these elaborately costumed and staged allegorical ''tableaux'' with complex allegories mark a stage in the development of court pageantry and the [[masque]], as well as in the pre-history of [[opera]].&lt;ref&gt;See James W. Saslow, ''The Medici Wedding of 1589: Florentine Festival as Theatrum Mundi'' ((New Haven:Yale University Press) 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1598: For the triumphal entry of [[Pope Clement VIII]] into Ferrara, where the principal [[House of Este|Este]] line had failed and the Pope had declared the fief to have reverted to the Papal States, the occasion urgently required splendidly presented and concrete allegorical propaganda, in order to justify the new situation to the Ferrarese. Once ensconced, Clement was host to a series of dukes and ambassadors honoured with princely entries themselves, climaxed with the betrothals by proxy of [[Margaret of Austria, Queen of Spain|Margaret of Austria]] and [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Albert of Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;See Bonner Mitchell,  ''1598. A Year of Pageantry in Late Renaissance Ferrara'' (Binghamton: Medieval Texts and Studies) 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1648: The "[[Joyous Entry]]" of [[Archduke Leopold William of Austria]] into Antwerp was also coordinated by Gevartius, who devised its iconography and published his own description. Rather than three-dimensional arches and tableaux, the allegories were rendered in two dimensions on strategically placed screens.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Vlieghe, "The Decorations for Archduke Leopold William's State Entry into Antwerp" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''39''' (1976:190â198).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''S Curve''' is a traditional art concept in [[Ancient Greek sculpture]] and [[Roman sculpture]] where the figure's body and posture is depicted like a sinuous or serpentine "[[S]]". It is related to and is an extension of the art term of [[contrapposto]] which is when a figure is depicted [[Standing (position)|slouching]] or placing one's weight and thus [[center of gravity]] to one side.  However, the S Curve involves more of the body than the contrapposto, and is therefore considered to be a more advanced technical development.
The "S Curve" concept was initiated by famous Greek sculptor [[Praxiteles]], son of Kifissodotos.&lt;ref&gt;"Art Of Ancient Greece, Brief History (1050- 50 b.C.), Georgia Kokkorou- Aleyra&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shakespeare's editors''' were essential in the development of the modern practice of producing printed books and the evolution of [[textual criticism]].

The 17th-century [[Folio (printing)|folio]] collections of the plays of [[William Shakespeare]] did not have editors in the modern sense of the term. In the best understanding of contemporary consensus scholarship, the plays to be included in the [[First Folio]] ([[1623 in literature|1623]]) were gathered together or "compiled" by [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]], two long-time colleagues of Shakespeare in the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]. The play manuscripts may have been [[proofreading|proofread]] and prepared for printing by [[Edward Knight (King's Men)|Edward Knight]], the "book-keeper" or prompter of the company. The task of [[First Folio#First Folio Technique|proofreading and correcting]] the actual printed pages of the Folio was left to the [[First Folio#Compositors|compositors]] and printers in the print-shop, yielding the uneven and often defective text that is the First Folio.

Even less is known about the creation of the [[Second Folio|Second]] ([[1632 in literature|1632]]), Third ([[1663 in literature|1663&amp;ndash;64]]), and Fourth Folios ([[1685 in literature|1685]]) than about the First; see [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)]].

In the 18th century, however, interested individuals made the first concerted efforts to bring order to the tangle of textual difficulties that the Folios of the previous century presented. The list below gives the date of each edition of Shakespeare's plays, the editor, the format of the collection, and pertinent specific information.

*[[1709 in literature|1709]], [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]]; [[book size|octavo]], 6 volumes. Rowe was the first person to attempt a clean and fully comprehensible text of the plays; but he depended upon a copy of the Fourth Folio and made generally [[conjectural emendation]]s. He also added full stage directions (he was a playwright himself) and full lists of ''Dramatis personae'', and wrote the first biographical sketch of the poet. 
*[[1725 in literature|1725]], [[Alexander Pope]]; [[book size|quarto]], 6 volumes. Pope was the first to attempt a collation of the quarto texts of the plays, yet he produced what was basically a reprint of Rowe that added little of value.
*[[1733 in literature|1733]], [[Lewis Theobald]]; octavo, 7 volumes. Theobald has been called "the first Shakespeare scholar";&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; he carried forward the task of collating the quartos, and began the study of Shakespeare's sources and the order of the plays' composition. (See [[Chronology of William Shakespeare's plays|Chronology of Shakespeare's plays]].)
*[[1744 in literature|1744]], [[Thomas Hanmer (politician)|Thomas Hanmer]]; quarto, 6 volumes. Hanmer relied on Theobald's text, and made guesswork corrections. His edition was reprinted in [[1770 in literature|1770]].
*[[1747 in literature|1747]], [[William Warburton]]; octavo, 8 volumes. Warburton built upon Pope's edition; indeed, Warburton placed Pope's name before his own on the title pages of his edition. In his preface, Warburton wrote that his friend Pope "was desirous I should give a new Edition of this Poet, as he thought it might contribute to put a stop to a prevailing folly of altering the Text of celebrated Authors without Talents or Judgment. And he was willing that ''his'' Edition should be melted down into ''mine'', as it would, he said, afford him (so great is the modesty of an ingenuous temper) a fit opportunity of confessing his Mistakes." The phrase "without Talents or Judgment" refers to Theobold and Hanmer. However, Warburton did allow, rather begrudgingly, some corrections put forward by Theobold and Hanmer: "For the rest, all the Corrections which these two Editors have made on any ''reasonable'' Foundation, are here admitted into the Text; and carefully assigned to their respective Authors. A piece of Justice which the ''Oxford Editor'' never did; and which the ''Other'' was not always scrupulous in observing towards me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warburton|first1=William|title=The Works of Shakespear|date=1747|publisher=J. &amp; P. Knapton; S. Birt; T. Longman &amp; T. Shewell; and others|location=London|pages=title page, xix, &amp; xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In [[1748 in literature|1748]] Thomas Edwards published his ''Supplement to Warburton's Edition of Shakespeare'', in later editions called ''The Canons of Criticism'' &amp;mdash; a satirical but spot-on analysis of Warburton's editorial emendations, some of which are truly silly.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: {{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Thomas|title=The Canons of Criticism, and Glossary|date=1765|publisher=C. Bathurst|location=London|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Johnson had this to say: "Soon after Edwards's ''Canons of Criticism'' came out, Johnson was dining at Tonson the Bookseller's, with Hayman the Painter and some more company. Hayman related to Sir Joshua Reynolds, that the conversation having turned upon Edwards's book, the gentlemen praised it much, and Johnson allowed its merit. But when they went farther, and appeared to put that authour upon a level with Warburton, "Nay, (said Johnson,) he has given him some smart hits to be sure; but there is no proportion between the two men; they must not be named together. A fly, Sir, may sting a stately horse and make him wince; but one is but an insect, and the other is a horse still."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boswell|first1=James|editor1-last=Malone|editor1-first=Edmond|title=The Life of Samuel Johnson|date=1807|publisher=T. Cadell &amp; W. Davies|location=London|page=207, note 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[1765 in literature|1765]], [[Samuel Johnson]], ''[[The Plays of William Shakespeare]]''; octavo, 8 volumes. Johnson in turn relied upon Warburton; his edition is noteworthy mainly for its famous Preface.
*[[1768 in literature|1768]], [[Edward Capell]]; octavo, 10 volumes. Appalled by the undisciplined emendations of Hanmer and Warburton, Capell spent three decades collecting and collating the quartos. He was also the first to exploit the [[Stationers' Register]] and [[Francis Meres]]'s ''Palladis Tamia'', and to explore Shakespeare's use of [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''Chronicles'' and Sir [[Thomas North]]'s translation of [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives]].''
*[[1773 in literature|1773]], [[George Steevens]]; octavo, 10 volumes. Steevens employed Johnson's text, but continued Capell's trend of adding new material. Steevens revised and re-issued his edition in [[1778 in literature|1778]]; in [[1780 in literature|1780]] Edmond Malone added another 2 volumes that contained Shakespeare's non-dramatic poems and other material. [[Isaac Reed]] revised the Steevens edition again in 1785, and Steevens himself produced one final, 15-volume revision in [[1793 in literature|1793]].
*[[1790 in literature|1790]], [[Edmond Malone]]; octavo, 10 volumes. Malone, often considered the best of the century's editors of Shakespeare, wrote the first general consideration of [[English Renaissance theatre]], utilizing resources like the records of the [[Master of the Revels]] and [[Edward Alleyn]]'s papers at [[Dulwich College]].  He is also noted for his work on the problem of chronology.

The early 19th century saw the first [[Variorum]] editions of Shakespeare's works, editions that collated and synthesized the efforts of the editors of the previous century:

*[[1803 in literature|1803]], the First Variorum edition, edited by [[Isaac Reed]]; 21 volumes.
*[[1813 in literature|1813]], the Second Variorum, a reprint of the First; 21 volumes.
*[[1821 in literature|1821]], the Third Variorum, edited by James Boswell;&lt;ref&gt;Not the famous [[James Boswell|Boswell]], the biographer of Johnson, but rather his third son (1778&amp;ndash;1822): Michael Dobson and Stanley Wells: ''The Oxford Companion to Shakespeare.'' OUP 2001. pg. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; 21 volumes.

These massive editions laid the foundation for modern textual scholarship on Shakespeare's works, and by extension on works of literature in general. In the 19th century the text, drawn primarily from Malone and Steevens, was "monumentalized"{{sfn|de Grazia|1991|p=14}} in the Cambridge edition (1863-6) and its single-volume companion, the Globe edition (1864). It was followed by the New Cambridge edition in 1921, and all modern standard editions inherit primarily from this edition.{{Sfn|de Grazia|1991|p=14}}

As for the personalities involved: some of these men were friends, like Steevens, Reed, and Malone; acquaintances called them the Shakespeare Gang. Others nourished spirits of competitiveness and resentment. Pope made Theobald the first hero of ''[[The Dunciad]].'' Warburton belittled Rowe's "Account of the Life" of Shakespeare &amp;mdash; but he reprinted it in his own edition, without change or improvement. Despite his friendship with Malone and Reed, Steevens was famous for his irascibility; in notes to his 1793 edition of Shakespeare, he concocted obscene interpretations of some passages and attributed those readings to people he didn't like.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, pp. 30, 110, 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major edition, the Cambridge Shakespeare (1863&amp;ndash;66), moved away from the practice of a single editor following his own sometimes capricious instincts and judgments. The first volume of the Cambridge Shakespeare was edited by [[William George Clark]] and John Glover, and the subsequent eight volumes by Clark and [[William Aldis Wright]]. Clark and Wright also produced the single-volume Globe Shakespeare (1864) using their Cambridge texts; together, these became the standard for the remainder of the century.

The most radical edition in the twentieth century was the [[Oxford Shakespeare]], prepared under the general editorship of [[Stanley Wells]] and [[Gary Taylor (English literature scholar)|Gary Taylor]]. It aims to present the texts as they were originally performed, which results in numerous controversial choices, including presenting multiple texts of ''[[King Lear]]'', a text of ''[[Hamlet]]'' in which the scenes presumably cut by Shakespeare are relegated to an appendix, and an emphasis on the collaborative nature of several of the plays.

'''Smarthistory''' is a free resource for the study of [[art history]] created by art historians Beth Harris and Steven Zucker.

According to the Smarthistory about page:
{{quote|We are interested in delivering the narratives of art history using the read-write web's interactivity and capacity for authoring and remixing. Publishers are adding multimedia to their textbooks, but unfortunately they are doing so in proprietary, password-protected adjunct websites.

In an article in the Brooklyn ''New York Daily News'', staff writer Elizabeth Lazarowitz quotes Steven Zucker, "Art can be really intimidating for people", said Zucker. "If we can make art feel exciting and interesting and very much relevant to a historical moment...art can have real meaning." Unlike reading about art in a book, "the idea of the audio was to keep a student's eyes on the image", he explained. "It helped students to learn the material a lot better."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2011/02/25/2011-02-25_masterpiece_theater_vids_new_way_to_look_at_art.html "Brooklyn-based art historians launch website with videos of masterpieces" New York Daily News, 2/25/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a collaborative article by Beth Harris and Steven Zucker, the founders explain the value of the resource for teachers, students, and informal learners: "Smarthistory is helping teachers who are not specialists in art history find strategies to make the subject accessible and meaningful to students who might otherwise not have cultural resources available to them. And for college students, the site is fast becoming an attractive alternative to the commercial textbook whose short life cycle and $100+ price tag has increasingly become a barrier."&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:bhHeVbf82cEJ:openaccess.uoc.edu/webapps/o2/bitstream/10609/5081/6/Zucker_editat.pdf+beth+harris+smarthistory&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjS1HrPqlUZBCUfp3VYz0UDmX0KBXi1hn_R1Vra7yaTP9uIjdKlRBELcD0KzrArBHzEjHI7bpvF52q0sVV9r7PUl9nYH10GExmuJ_QhmyveHLm9Gpha9t4dckaOwhzwn74C1YUk&amp;sig=AHIEtbT5zd1NJEjqrV1SEwwquFk6RBcNAw "Conversation is Key: A Short History of Smarthistory.org"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''Chronicle for Higher Education'' article, Beth Harris is quoted on the ambitions and goals of Smarthistory: "We really just wanted to re-embed the objects in our world", says Harris, who is the founder and executive editor of Smarthistory as well as the director of digital learning at a New York City museum. "We thought that that would make them more relevant and more engaging for students."&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/%E2%80%98smarthistory%E2%80%99-rethinks-the-art-history-textbook-online/28395 "'Smarthistory' rethinks the art history textbook online"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soviet art''' is the [[visual art]] that was produced in the [[Soviet Union]].

==Soviet Avant-Garde art==
[[File:Lenin_attempt.jpg|300px|thumb|right|alt=Vladimir Pchelin painting about Lenin's assassination attempt, from 1927|[[Vladimir Pchelin]]'s artwork about Lenin's assassination attempt, 1927]]
[[File:Malevich142.jpg|200px|thumb|right|alt=Kazimir Malevich abstract painting ''Mower'' from 1930|''Mower'' by [[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich]], 1930]]
During the [[Bolshevik Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] a movement was initiated to put all arts to service of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. The instrument for this was created just days before the [[October Revolution]], known as [[Proletkult]], an abbreviation for "Proletarskie kulturno-prosvetitelnye organizatsii" (Proletarian Cultural and Enlightenment Organizations). A prominent theorist of this movement was [[Aleksandr Bogdanov]]. Initially [[Narkompros]] (ministry of education), which was also in charge of the arts, supported Proletkult. However the latter sought too much independence from the ruling [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] of [[Bolsheviks]], gained negative attitude of [[Vladimir Lenin]], by 1922 declined considerably, and was eventually disbanded in 1932.
The ideas of Proletkult attracted the interests of [[Russian avantgarde]], who strived to  get rid of the conventions of "bourgeois art". Among notable persons of this movement was [[Kazimir Malevich]]. However the ideas of the avantgarde eventually clashed with the newly emerged state-sponsored direction of [[Socialist Realism]].

In search of new forms of expression, the Proletkult organisation was highly eclectic in its art forms, and thus was prone to harsh criticism for inclusion of such modern directions as [[impressionism]] and [[cubism]], since these movements existed before the revolution and hence were associated with "decadent bourgeois art".

Among early experiments of Proletkult was [[pragmaic aesthetic|pragmatic aesthetic]] of [[industrial art]], the prominent theoretist being [[Boris Arvatov]].

Another group was [[UNOVIS]], a very short-lived but influential collection of young artists led by [[Kasimir Malevich]] in the 1920s.

==Socialist realism==
{{Main|Socialist realism}}

Officially approved art was required to follow the doctrine of [[Socialist Realism]]. In the spring of 1932, the Central Committee of the Communist Party decreed that all existing literary and artistic groups and organizations should be disbanded and replaced with unified associations of creative professions. Accordingly, the Moscow and Leningrad Union of Artists was established on August 1932, which brought the history of post-revolutionary art to a close. The epoch of Soviet art began.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei V. Ivanov. ''Unknown Socialist Realism: The Leningrad School'', pp. 28â29. {{ISBN|5-901724-21-6}}, {{ISBN|978-5-901724-21-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known Soviet artists were [[Isaak Brodsky]], [[Alexander Nikolayevich Samokhvalov|Alexander Samokhvalov]], [[Boris Ioganson]], [[Aleksandr Deyneka]], [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Laktionov|Aleksandr Laktionov]], [[:ru:ÐÐµÐ¿ÑÐ¸Ð½ÑÐµÐ², Ð®ÑÐ¸Ð¹ ÐÐ¸ÑÐ°Ð¹Ð»Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ|Yuri Neprintsev]] and other painters from Moscow and Leningrad School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leningradartist.com/outline.htm ''Segei V.

Historical outline.]&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow artist [[Aleksandr Gerasimov (painter)|Aleksandr Gerasimov]] during his career produced a large number of heroic paintings of [[Joseph Stalin]] and other members of the [[Politburo]]. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] later alleged that [[Kliment Voroshilov]] spent more time posing in Gerasimov's studio than he did attending to his duties in the People's Commissariat of Defense. Gerasimov's painting shows a mastery of classical representational techniques.

However, art exhibitions of 1935â1960 disprove the claims that artistic life of the period was suppressed by the ideology and artists submitted entirely to what was then called âsocial orderâ. A great number of landscapes, portraits, genre paintings and studies exhibited at the time pursued purely technical purposes and were thus free from any ideology. Thematic painting was also approached in a similar way.&lt;ref&gt;Vern G. Swanson, ''Soviet Impressionist Painting.'' Woodbridge, England: Antique Collectors' Club, 2008; p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-war period between the mid-1950s and 1960s, the [[:ru:ÐÐµÐ½Ð¸Ð½Ð³ÑÐ°Ð´ÑÐºÐ°Ñ ÑÐºÐ¾Ð»Ð° Ð¶Ð¸Ð²Ð¾Ð¿Ð¸ÑÐ¸|Leningrad school]] was approaching its apex. Artists who had graduated from the Academy ([[Repin Institute of Arts]]) in the 1930sâ50s were in their prime. They were quick to present their art, they strived for experiments and were eager to appropriate a lot and to learn even more. Their time and contemporaries, with all its images, ideas and dispositions found it full expression in portraits by [[:ru:Ð ÑÑÐ¾Ð², ÐÐµÐ² ÐÐ»ÐµÐºÑÐ°Ð½Ð´ÑÐ¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ|Lev Russov]], [[:ru:ÐÑÐµÑÐ½Ð¸ÐºÐ¾Ð², ÐÐ¸ÐºÑÐ¾Ñ ÐÐ¸ÑÐ°Ð¹Ð»Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ|Victor Oreshnikov]], Boris Korneev, Semion Rotnitsky, Vladimir Gorb, Engels Kozlov, landscapes by [[:ru:Ð¢Ð¸Ð¼ÐºÐ¾Ð², ÐÐ¸ÐºÐ¾Ð»Ð°Ð¹ ÐÑÐ¸Ð¼Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ|Nikolai Timkov]], [[:ru:ÐÐ²ÑÐ¸Ð½Ð½Ð¸ÐºÐ¾Ð², ÐÐ»Ð°Ð´Ð¸Ð¼Ð¸Ñ ÐÐ²Ð°Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ|Vladimir Ovchinnikov]], [[:ru:ÐÑÐ¸Ð¿Ð¾Ð², Ð¡ÐµÑÐ³ÐµÐ¹ ÐÐ²Ð°Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ|Sergei Osipov]], [[:ru:Ð¡ÐµÐ¼ÐµÐ½Ð¾Ð², ÐÐ»ÐµÐºÑÐ°Ð½Ð´Ñ ÐÐ¸ÑÐ°Ð¹Ð»Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ|Alexander Semionov]], [[:ru:Ð¡ÐµÐ¼ÐµÐ½Ð¾Ð², ÐÑÑÐµÐ½Ð¸Ð¹ ÐÐ¸ÐºÐ¸ÑÐ¾ÑÐ¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ|Arseny Semionov]], Nikolai Galakhov, genre paintings by [[:ru:ÐÐ¾Ð·Ð´Ð½ÐµÐµÐ², ÐÐ¸ÐºÐ¾Ð»Ð°Ð¹ ÐÐ°ÑÐ²ÐµÐµÐ²Ð¸Ñ|Nikolai Pozdneev]], [[:ru:ÐÐµÐ¿ÑÐ¸Ð½ÑÐµÐ², Ð®ÑÐ¸Ð¹ ÐÐ¸ÑÐ°Ð¹Ð»Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ|Yuri Neprintsev]], Yevsey Moiseenko, Andrey Milnikov. Art of this period showed extraordinary taste for life and creative work.

In 1957, the first all-Russian Congress of Soviet artists took place in Moscow. In 1960, the all-Russian Union of Artists was organized. Accordingly, these events influenced the art life in Moscow, Leningrad and province. The scope of experimentation was broadened; in particular, this concerned the form and painterly and plastic language. Images of youths and students, rapidly changing villages and cities, virgin lands brought under cultivation, grandiose construction plans being realized in Siberia and the Volga region, great achievements of Soviet science and technology became the chief topics of the new painting. Heroes of the time â young scientists, workers, civil engineers, physicians â become the most popular heroes of paintings.

At this period, life provided artists with plenty of thrilling topics, positive figures and images. Legacy of many great artists and [[art movements]] became available for study and public discussions again. This greatly broadened artistsâ understanding of the [[realist art|realist method]] and widened its possibilities. It was the repeated renewal of the very conception of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] that made this style dominates in the [[Russian art]] throughout its history. Realist tradition gave rise to many trends of [[Contemporary art|contemporary painting]], including painting from nature, "severe style" painting and decorative art. However, during this period [[impressionism]], [[postimpressionism]], [[cubism]] and [[expressionism]] also had their fervent adherents and interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leningradschool.com/outline.htm ''Sergei V.

==Soviet Nonconformist Art==
{{Main|Soviet Nonconformist Art}}

The death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953, and [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[Khrushchev Thaw|Thaw]], paved the way for a wave of liberalization in the arts throughout the [[Soviet Union]].  Although no official change in policy took place, artists began to feel free to experiment in their work, with considerably less fear of repercussions than during the Stalinist period.

In the 1950s Moscow artist [[Ely Bielutin]] encouraged his students to experiment with [[abstractionism]], a practice thoroughly discouraged by the [[Creative unions in the Soviet Union|Artists' Union]], which strictly enforced the official policy of [[Socialist Realism]].  Artists who chose to paint in alternative styles had to do so completely in private and were never able to exhibit or sell their work. As a result, [[Nonconformist Art]] developed along a separate path than the [[Official Art]] that was recorded in the history books.

[[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine published two portraits by two painters, who to their mind, were most representative of Russian Arts of the period: it was Serov, an official Soviet icon and [[Anatoly Zverev]], an underground [[Russian avant-garde]] expressionist.  Serov's portrait of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and Zverev's selfportrait were associated by many with an eternal Biblical struggle of Satan and Saviour.  When Khrushchev learned about the publication he was outraged and forbade all contacts with Western visitors, closed down all semi legal exhibitions.  And of course Zverev was the main target of his outrage.

The [[Soviet Nonconformist Art#Lianozovo|Lianozovo Group]] was formed around the artist [[Oscar Rabin (artist)|Oscar Rabin]] in the 1960s and included artists such as [[Valentina Kropivnitskaya]], [[Vladimir Nemukhin]], and [[Lydia Masterkova]].  While not adhering to any common style, these artists sought to faithfully express themselves in the mode they deemed appropriate, rather than adhere to the propagandistic style of [[Socialist Realism]].

Tolerance of Nonconformist Art by the authorities underwent an ebb and flow until the ultimate collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991.  Artists took advantage of the first few years after the death of Stalin to experiment in their work without the fear of persecution.  In 1962, artists experienced a slight setback when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] appeared at the exhibition of the 30th anniversary of the Moscow Artist's Union at the [[Moscow Manege]] exhibition hall, an episode known as the [[Manege Affair]].  Among the customary works of [[Socialist Realism]] were a few abstract works by artists such as [[Ernst Neizvestny]] and [[Eli Beliutin]], which Khrushchev criticized as being "shit," and the artists for being "homosexuals."  The message was clear: artistic policy was not as liberal as everyone had hoped.

The history of late Soviet art has been dominated by politics and simplistic formulae. Both within the artworld and the general public, very little consideration has been given to the aesthetic character of the work produced in the USSR in the 1970s and 1980s. Instead, the official and unofficial art of the period usually stood in for either "bad" or "good" political developments.  A more nuanced picture would emphasize that there were numerous competing groups making art in Moscow and Leningrad throughout this period. The most important figures for the international art scene have been the Moscow artists Ilya Kabakov, Erik Bulatov, Andrei Monastyrsky, Vitaly Komar and Aleksandr Melamid.

The most infamous incident regarding nonconformist artists in the former Soviet Union was the 1974 [[Bulldozer Exhibition]], which took place in a park just outside Moscow, and included work by such artists as [[Oscar Rabin (artist)|Oscar Rabin]], [[Komar and Melamid]], [[Alexandr Zhdanov]], [[Nikolai Smoliakov]] and [[Leonid Sokov]].  The artists involved had written to the authorities for permission to hold the exhibition but received no answer to their request.  They decided to go ahead with the exhibition anyway, which consisted solely of unofficial works of art that did not fit into the rubric of [[Socialist Realism]].  The [[KGB]] put an end to the exhibition just hours after it opened by bringing in bulldozers to completely destroy all of the artworks present.  However, the foreign press had been there to witness the event, and the worldwide coverage of it forced the authorities to permit an exhibition of Nonconformist Art two weeks later in [[Izmailovsky Park]] in Moscow.

A few West European collectors, supported during the 60th and the 70th and until 1988 (the year of the Perestroika) many of the artists in the old Soviet Union. One of the leading collectors and philanthropists were the couple Kenda and Jacob Bar-Gera. The Bar-Gera Collection consists of some 200 works of 59 Soviet Russian artists of who did not want to embrace the official art directive of the post-Stalinist Soviet Union. Kenda and Jacob Bar-Gera, both are survivors of the holocaust, supported these partially persecuted artists by sending them money or painting material from Germany to the Soviet Union. Even though the Kenda and Jacob did not meet the artists in person, they bought many of their paintings and other art objects. The works were smuggled to Germany by hiding them in the suitcases of diplomats, traveling businessmen, and students, thus making the Bar-Gera Collection of Russian Non-Conformists among the largest of its kind in the world. Among others, the collection content works of Bachtschanjan Vagritsch, Jankilevskij Wladimir,Rabin  Oskar, Batschurin Ewganij, Kabakov Ilja, Schablavin Sergei, Belenok Piotr, Krasnopevcev Dimitrij, Schdanov Alexander, [[Igor Novikov (painter)|Igor Novikov]],
Bitt Galina, Kropivnitzkaja Walentina, Schemjakin Michail, Bobrowskaja Olga, Kropivnitzkij Lew,Schwarzman  Michail, Borisov  Leonid, Kropiwnizkij Jewgenij, Sidur  Vadim, Bruskin Grischa, Kulakov  Michail, Sitnikov  Wasili, and many others.

By the 1980s, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[Perestroika]] and [[Glasnost]] made it virtually impossible for the authorities to place restrictions on artists or their freedom of expression.  With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], the new market economy enabled the development of a gallery system, which meant that artists no longer had to be employed by the state, and could create work according to their own tastes, as well as the tastes of their private patrons.  Consequently, after around 1986 the phenomenon of Nonconformist Art in the Soviet Union ceased to exist.

'''''Sticky: A (Self) Love Story''''' is a 2016 documentary and comedy film by Nicholas Tana that attempts to explain why most people are afraid to discuss [[masturbation]]. The movie is one of the first documentaries to address the myths and social taboos around masturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexpert.com/sextainment/sticky-self-love-story-first-documentary-masturbation/|title=Sticky, A (Self) Love Story; The First Documentary on Masturbation - Sexpert.com|first=Anka|last=Radakovich|website=Sexpert.com|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer for ''Sticky: A (Self) Love Story''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/01/watch-things-get-sticky-in-exclusive-trailer-for-nsfw-masturbation-doc-38861|title=Watch: Things Get âStickyâ in Exclusive Trailer for NSFW Masturbation Doc|first=Mike|last=Lown|publisher=[[IndieWire]]|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was selected as top trailers of the week by [[IndieWire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/the-best-trailers-of-the-week-high-rise-masturbation-doc-and-tilda-swinton-make-a-splash-20160108|title=The Best Trailers of The Week... |author=Zach Sharf|publisher=IndieWire|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/movies/director-nicholas-tana-sticky-a-self-love-story-interview|title=Director Nicholas Tana Breaks Down The Taboos Of Masturbation In 'Sticky: A Self Love Story'|date=February 3, 2016|website=Uproxx.com|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on sex education==
The feature-length documentary has received positive reviews in national media for its controversial stance in favor of [[masturbation]] as part of [[sex education]]. The filmmaker Nicholas Tana was paid to speak during a screening of his film at the 47th. annual [[American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists|American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors, and Therapists (AASECT)]] conference in Minneapolis in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aasect.org/sites/default/files/AASECT%202015%20Annual%20Conference%20Final%20Program%20(Minneapolis,%20MN).pdf|format=PDF|title=47TH AASECT ANNUAL CONFERENCE|website=Aasect.org|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which time an early educational cut of the film was screened in front of over a hundred certified sex educators. 

The AASECT screening resulted in invitations to conduct educational screenings at [[Arizona State University]] sponsored by VOX Voices For Planned Parenthood,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/arts/this-asu-grad-made-a-masturbation-doc-called-sticky-because-of-course-8194179|title=This ASU Grad Made a Masturbation Doc Called Sticky, Because of Course|author=Lauren Cusimano|work=The Phoenix New Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Wisconsin]] sponsored by Sex Outloud,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://union.wisc.edu/events-and-activities/event-calendar/event/sticky-2016|title=Sticky (2016)|website=Wisc.edu|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eastern Michigan University]] spearheaded by Pam Landau of the Psychology department&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emich.edu/psychology/special-events/HSM_2016_sticky.php|title=Eastern Michigan University: Psychology Department|website=Emich.edu|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in April 2016 and ending in May 2016 in honor of international Masturbation Month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-zombeck/get-to-know-yourself-its-_b_3290255.html|title=Get to Know Yourself -- It's Masturbation Month|first=Richard|last=Zombeck|date=May 20, 2013|website=Huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The film addresses the need for sex education that discusses masturbation in a healthy manner to students; it includes interviewees with sex educators who express concerns about not properly educating children around sex and masturbation. The [[Harvard University]] screened ''Sticky: A (Self) Love Story'' on campus in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] on April 4, 2017, as part of Harvard's Sex week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/4/11/sex-weekend-stimulates-discussion|title='Sex Weekend' Seeks to Stimulate Discussion - News|website=Thecrimson.com|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contrasting viewpoints on health==
Full of interviews from sex educators, religious figures, and psychologists, the documentary offers often contrasting opinions about the health benefits both physically and psychologically of masturbation. Among those interviewed who belief masturbation could be harmful is Alexander Rhodes, the founder of a popular Reddit masturbation abstinence group called [[NoFap]]. The movie also includes health findings associated with a Cambridge Study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090126082343.htm|title=Frequent Sex And Masturbation In 20s And 30s Linked To Higher Prostate Cancer, But Risks Diminish With Age|website=Sciencedaily.com|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; that link masturbation to prostate cancer, and a Chinese medical doctor's warning about the impact too much masturbation could have on a men's health and vitality.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

These perspectives are contrasted with sex-positive statements from notable sex educators who speak in favor of the health benefits of [[masturbation]]. The film also references a medical study written in [[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] indicating that masturbation might help to prevent prostate cancer.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

==Sex-positive feminism==
The film contains interviews with some of the founding members of the [[Sex-positive feminism|sex positive feminism]] movement. These interviewees include [[Nina Hartley]], [[Betty Dodson]], [[Joani Blank]], and [[Carol Queen]].{{cn|date=September 2017}} Judy Norsidian and Wendy Sanford who worked for many years on the publication of the historical sex education book "[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]" both appear in the film.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

==Issues==
''Sticky: A (Self) Love Story'' traces societal shame and guilt affiliated with [[masturbation]] to events in history and religious beliefs, and calls into question how this may influence politics and scientific study. {{cn|date=September 2017}} Among the issues discussed in the film is the [[Anti-Obscenity Enforcement Act|Anti-Obscenity Act]] that bans the sale of sex toys in the state of Alabama, and the contradictory stances of four major religions surrounding [[masturbation]], which include [[Catholicism]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Judaism]].{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Other topics include the controversial firing of the first African American [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] by former U.S. President Bill Clinton; the career damaging fall out after [[Paul Reubens]] (Pee-Wee Herman) arrest in an adult theater for masturbating in public; current debates concerning sex education; the billion dollar sex toy industry; contradictory prostate cancer studies linked to male masturbation; the media obsession with sex addiction and sexual compulsion; the FBI study that links compulsive masturbation to serial killers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfYFYEWb62AC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;lpg=PA280&amp;dq=FBI+Study+compulsive+masturbation+to+serial+killers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EtBe5Bqga4&amp;sig=DoxQo82Na5DxH6GALXLzlMfsOOY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkoJS_2u_QAhUDzWMKHYwbC8AQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=FBI+Study+compulsive+masturbation+to+serial+killers&amp;f=false|title=Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters|first=Peter|last=Vronsky|date=5 October 2004|publisher=Penguin|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; the impact of pornography on relationships; opinions as to the future of masturbation.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

==Masturbation in politics==
The film contains an interview with the first African American appointed as Surgeon General, [[Joycelyn Elders]] about why she was fired by former president [[Bill Clinton]] for her controversial statement on world's AIDS day in favor of sex education on masturbation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/remember-time-bill-clinton-fired-his-surgeon-general-encouraging-masturbation-423302|title=Remember that Time Bill Clinton Fired His Surgeon General For Encouraging Masturbation Education?|author=Zach Schonfeld|website=Newsweek.com|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; an interview with comedian [[Janeane Garofalo]] about her embarrassment on doing the phone sex masturbation scene in ''[[The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs|The Truth About Cats And Dogs]]'', and an interview with "[[Hustler]]" creator [[Larry Flynt]] about how he came to discover masturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/01/22/sticky-documentary-dispels-myths-about-self-love.html|title='Sticky' Documentary Dispels Myths About Self-Love|author=Samantha Allen|newspaper=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=January 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Masturbation in film, TV, and music==
The impact of masturbation on the media is explored through a series of movie clips and music. [[Film Threat]] founder and film critic, [[Chris Gore]], states in the documentary that most instances of masturbation depicted in movies or television are seen as either grotesque or as something one wouldn't want to be caught doing. This comment is substantiated by clips from movies like ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' and ''[[American Pie (film series)|American Pie]]'' shown in the film. 

Television clips from the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode called "The Contest" and a clip from ''[[Sex and the City|Sex in the City]]'' are also discussed, along with songs that make reference to masturbation in some way. A section in the film on Masturbation and Media includes interviews with comedian [[Ant (comedian)|ANT]], and [[Keith Morris]], singer/songwriter formerly of [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and [[Circle Jerks|The Circle Jerks]]. The movie features an acoustic performance of the song "[[I Touch Myself|Touch Myself]]" played by songwriter Billy Steinberg who is also interviewed in the documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sdcitybeat.com/article-17814-keith-morris-sticky-a-(self)-love-story-and-the-radvocate.html|title=Keith Morris, ''Sticky: A (Self) Love Story'' and The Radvocate|author=Citybeat Staff|work=San Diego City Beat|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009 at a meeting of the [[Copenhagen Climate Council]] 2,500 climate experts from 80 countries issued a keynote statement that there is now "no excuse" for failing to act on global warming and that without strong carbon reduction targets "abrupt or irreversible" shifts in climate may occur that "will be very difficult for contemporary societies to cope with".&lt;ref&gt;University of Copenhagen (March 2009) [http://climatecongress.ku.dk/newsroom/congress_key_messages/ "Key Messages from the Congress"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316181631/http://climatecongress.ku.dk/newsroom/congress_key_messages/ |date=2009-03-16 }} News item on Copenhagen Climate Congress in March 2009.

Other human impacts on the atmosphere include the [[air pollution]] in cities, the [[pollutants]] including toxic chemicals like [[nitrogen oxides]], [[Sulfur oxide|sulphur oxides]], [[volatile organic compounds]] and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulate matter]] that produce [[photochemical smog]] and [[acid rain]], and the [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s that degrade the [[ozone layer]].

Known as [[global dimming]] the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global [[water cycle]] by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a [[Thermal energy|cooling]] effect and this may have partially masked the effect of [[greenhouse gases]] on [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;Hegerl, G.C. et al. (2007).

==Freshwater==
{{See|Water crisis}}

Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Of this, 97.5% is the salty water of the [[ocean]]s and only 2.5% freshwater, most of which is locked up in the [[Antarctic ice sheet]]. The remaining freshwater is found in lakes, rivers, wetlands, the soil, aquifers and atmosphere. All life depends on the solar-powered global water cycle, the evaporation from oceans and land to form water vapour that later condenses from clouds as rain, which then becomes the renewable part of the freshwater supply.&lt;ref name="Atlas"&gt;Clarke &amp; King (2006) pp.&amp;nbsp;20â21.&lt;/ref&gt;  Awareness of the global importance of preserving [[water]] for [[ecosystem services]] has only recently emerged as, during the 20th century, more than half the worldâs [[wetlands]] have been lost along with their valuable environmental services. [[Biodiversity]]-rich [[freshwater]] ecosystems are currently declining faster than [[marine (ocean)|marine]] or land [[ecosystem]]s&lt;ref name="water"&gt;Hoekstra, A.Y. (2006).

Greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue (harvestable) and green (soil water available for plant use) water, and this applies at all scales of water management.&lt;ref name="water" /&gt;

==Land==
{{See|Land use}}
Loss of biodiversity stems largely from the habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as [[natural capital]] is progressively converted to man-made capital. Land use change is fundamental to the operations of the [[biosphere]] because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to [[urbanisation]], [[agriculture]], [[forest]], [[woodland]], [[grassland]] and [[pasture]] have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen [[biogeochemical cycle]]s and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems.&lt;ref name="Krebs 2001 pp. 560â582"/&gt; At the local human scale major sustainability benefits accrue from the pursuit of [[green cities]] and [[sustainable gardening|sustainable parks and gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://extension.missouri.edu/publications/DisplayPub.aspx?P=G6220 Organic Gardening Techniques], ''Missouri University Extension''.

==Forests==
{{See|Forestry|Ecoforestry}}
[[File:Grib skov.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Beech forest â Grib Skov, Denmark|Beech forest â Grib Skov, Denmark]]

Since the [[Neolithic Revolution]], human use has reduced the worldâs forest cover by about 47%. Present-day forests occupy about a quarter of the worldâs ice-free land with about half of these occurring in the tropics&lt;ref&gt;World Resources Institute (1998). ''World Resources 1998â1999.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-521408-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In temperate and [[boreal forest|boreal]] regions forest area is gradually increasing (with the exception of Siberia), but [[deforestation]] in the tropics is of major concern.&lt;ref&gt;Groombridge &amp; Jenkins (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Forests moderate the local climate and the global water cycle through their light reflectance ([[albedo]]) and [[evapotranspiration]]. They also conserve [[biodiversity]], protect [[water quality]], preserve soil and [[soil quality]], provide fuel and [[pharmaceuticals]], and purify the air. These free [[ecosystem services]] are not given a market value under most current economic systems, and so forest conservation has little appeal when compared with the economic benefits of [[logging]] and clearance which, through [[soil degradation]] and organic [[decomposition]] returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name = FAO1&gt;Food and Agriculture Organisation (2006).

Retrieved on: 2009-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) estimates that about 90% of the carbon stored in land vegetation is locked up in trees and that they sequester about 50% more carbon than is present in the atmosphere. Changes in land use currently contribute about 20% of total global carbon emissions (heavily logged Indonesia and Brazil are a major source of emissions).&lt;ref name = FAO1/&gt; [[Climate change]] can be mitigated by sequestering carbon in [[reafforestation]] schemes, plantations and timber products. Also wood biomass can be utilized as a renewable [[carbon-neutral]] fuel. The FAO has suggested that, over the period 2005â2050, effective use of tree planting could absorb about 10â20% of man-made emissions â so monitoring the condition of the world's forests must be part of a global strategy to mitigate emissions and protect ecosystem services.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC (2006).'' IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Inventories, Vol.4, Agriculture, Forestry, and other Land Uses.'' Japan: Institute for Global Environment Strategies.&lt;/ref&gt; However, climate change may pre-empt this FAO scenario as a study by the [[International Union of Forest Research Organizations]] in 2009 concluded that the stress of a 2.5C (4.5F) temperature rise above pre-industrial levels could result in the release of vast amounts of carbon&lt;ref&gt;Kinver, M.

Although [[biodiversity loss]] can be monitored simply as loss of species, effective conservation demands the protection of species within their natural habitats and ecosystems. Following human migration and population growth, species [[extinctions]] have progressively increased to a rate unprecedented since the [[CretaceousâPaleogene extinction event]]. Known as the [[Holocene extinction event]] this current human-induced extinction of species ranks as one of the worlds six mass [[extinction event]]s. Some scientific estimates indicate that up to half of presently existing species may become extinct by 2100.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leakey &amp; Lewin (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Current extinction rates are 100 to 1000 times their prehuman levels with more than 10% birds and mammals threatened, about 8% of plants, 5% of fish and more than 20% of freshwater species.&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, pp. 42â47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 [[IUCN Red List]] warns that long-term droughts and extreme weather put additional stress on key habitats and, for example, lists 1,226 bird species as threatened with extinction, which is one-in-eight of all bird species.&lt;ref&gt;Kinver, M. (May 2008). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7409034.stm ''Climate 'accelerating bird loss.''] BBC News, UK.

In many parts of the industrial world land clearing for agriculture has diminished and here the greatest threat to biodiversity, after [[climate change]], has become the destructive effect of [[invasive species]].&lt;ref&gt;Randall (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasingly efficient global transport has facilitated the spread of [[organism]]s across the planet. The potential danger of this aspect of [[globalization]] is starkly illustrated through the spread of human diseases like [[HIV]] [[AIDS]], [[mad cow disease]], [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] and [[swine flu]], but invasive plants and animals are also having a devastating impact on native [[biodiversity]]. Non-indigenous organisms can quickly occupy disturbed land and natural areas where, in the absence of their natural [[predator]]s, they are able to thrive.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs (2001) pp. 190â205.&lt;/ref&gt; At the global scale this issue is being addressed through the [[Global Invasive Species Information Network]] but there is improved international [[biosecurity]] legislation to minimise the transmission of pathogens and invasive organisms. Also, through [[CITES]] legislation there is control the trade in rare and threatened species. Increasingly at the local level public awareness programs are alerting communities, gardeners, the nursery industry, collectors, and the pet and aquarium industries, to the harmful effects of potentially invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;Blood (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resistance to change==
{{Main|Sustainability and systemic change resistance}}
The environmental sustainability problem has proven difficult to solve. The modern [[environmental movement]] has attempted to solve the problem in a large variety of ways. But little progress has been made, as shown by severe [[ecological footprint]] overshoot and lack of sufficient progress on the [[climate change]] problem. Something within the human system in preventing change to a sustainable mode of behavior. That system trait is systemic change resistance. Change resistance is also known as organizational resistance, barriers to change, or policy resistance.&lt;ref&gt;John Sterman, "Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World, 2000, pp 5-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18410">'''Sustainable Development Goal 16''' (Goal 16, SDG16 or SDG 16) - peace, justice and strong institutions - is one of the 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] established by the [[United Nations]] in 2015. It "promote peaceful and inclusive societies for [[sustainable development]], provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations official website on SDGs: https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg16&lt;/ref&gt; The Goal has 12 targets to be achieved by 2030. Progress towards targets will be measured by 23 indicators. [[File:Sustainable Development Goal 16.png|thumb|SDG 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions]]

== Background ==

=== The Sustainable Development Goals ===
{{See also|Sustainable Development Goals}}
The Sustainable Development Goals are a collection of 17 global goals set by the [[United Nations]]. The broad goals are interrelated though each has its own targets to achieve. The total number of targets is 169. The SDGs cover a broad range of social and economic development issues. These include [[poverty]], [[hunger]], [[health]], [[education]], [[climate change]], [[gender equality]], [[Water supply|water,]] [[sanitation]], [[energy]], [[urbanization]], [[Environmental protection|environment]] and [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/4538pressowg13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations Official Document|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SDGs replace the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs), which started a global effort in 2002 to end poverty, achieve universal [[education]], [[Women's empowerment|empower women]], reduce [[child mortality]], improve [[maternal health]], combat diseases such as [[HIV]], ensure environment sustainability, and develop a global partnership for development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/bkgd.shtml|title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Outcome Document of the UN Summit on the 2030 Agenda, âTransforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Developmentâ, includes an emphasis on the importance of achieving progress on peaceful and inclusive societies, access to justice and rule of law, and effective, accountable and inclusive institutions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld|title=Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An annual report is prepared by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] evaluating the progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.&lt;ref&gt;See the 2017 report: http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/2017/66&amp;Lang=E&lt;/ref&gt; SDG 16 is going to be reviewed at the High-Level Political Forum in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/hlpf|title=High-level Political Forum .:.

Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Links with other SDGs ==
The Sustainable Development Goals are not taken as being completely independent one from the other, but rather as being closely linked. In this way, [[media development]] enhances freedom of speech, peace, but also contributes to [[sustainability]], poverty eradication and [[human rights]].&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/fostering-freedom-expression|title=Fostering Freedom of Expression|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fostering peace and inclusive societies can help reduce inequalities (SDG10) and help economies prosper (SDG8).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/background.html|title=Background of the Sustainable Development Goals|website=UNDP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 outcome document of the United Nations Summit on the 2030 Agenda considers that sustainable development can not be achieved without building peaceful, just and inclusive societies and addressing issues of corruption, poor governance, insecurity and injustice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some SDGs can be considered as cross-cutting as a whole. It is the case for [[gender equality]] and [[Africa]], which are considered a global priority for UNESCO and a "critical factor for the achievement of all internationally agreed development goals".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/africa/

http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/themes/gender-equality/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achievements ==

=== UNDP ===
The [[United Nations Development Programme]] is the United Nations [[International development|global development]] network who is also concerned with SDG 16 as the Programme focuses on [[Democracy|democratic governance]] and peace building.&lt;ref&gt;See official website: http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/democratic-governance-and-peacebuilding.html&lt;/ref&gt; The UNDP also works on conflict prevention by supporting empowering women and youth, and supporting regulatory frameworks and mechanisms and by acting as mediators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/democratic-governance-and-peacebuilding/conflict-prevention.html|title=Conflict prevention - UNDP|website=UNDP}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNDP has provided electoral assistance in over 50 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ec-undp-electoralassistance.org/|title=EC-UNDP Joint Task Force - Partnership on Electoral Assistance|website=www.ec-undp-electoralassistance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UNESCO ===
UNESCOâs work on freedom of expression and the [[Safety of Journalists|safety of journalists]] contributes to Goal 16. UNESCOâs approach to media development tries to be knowledge-driven and context-sensitive. The Organization also wants to take into account the new challenges and opportunities of the media environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/sdgs/ci|title=Sustainable Development Goals for Communication and Information|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO's communication and information sector&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/|title=Communication and Information - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is responsible for targets 16.3 (access to justice), 16.5 (anti-corruption and transparent and accountable institutions). It aims to: "foster intercultural dialogue, culture of peace and non-violence, and prevent [[violent extremism]] through global citizenship education; support free, independent and pluralistic media, ensure the safety of journalists; protect cultural and natural heritage, strengthen [[Multi-stakeholder governance|governance]] systems for culture and enhance fundamental freedoms."&lt;ref name="unesco.org1"&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002477/247785e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Preventing violent extremism ====
Preventing [[violent extremism]] is a way to promote, in official wording, a "culture of peace and non-violence" for UNESCO. The Organization aims to prevent violent extremism by using education as a tool to strengthen [[global citizenship]], by mobilizing youth, women and other stakeholders - such as [[policy]]-makers, researchers and media actors -  to take actions, online and offline, to prevent and respond to violent extremism and [[radicalization]] on the Internet&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002603/260382e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and to promote cultural diversity to foster more fair, inclusive and peaceful societies, through the #Unite4Heritage campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unite4heritage.org/|title=#Unite4Heritage â Celebrating &amp; Safeguarding Cultural Heritage - u4h|website=www.unite4heritage.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Educational Programmes on Heritage and Creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/protecting-our-heritage-and-fostering-creativity|title=Protecting Our Heritage and Fostering Creativity|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unesco.org1"/&gt;

==== Freedom of expression ====
{{Main|Freedom of speech}}
Freedom of speech is a principle that supports the [[freedom]] of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, [[censorship]], or sanction.&lt;ref name="Mill 1859 1-5"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |date=1859 |chapter-url=http://www.bartleby.com/130/1.html |chapter=Introductory |url=http://www.bartleby.com/130/ |title=On Liberty |edition=4th |location=London |publisher=Longman, Roberts &amp; Green |publication-date=1869 |at=para. 5 |quote=Society can and does execute its own mandates ... it practises a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself.

==== Freedom of information laws ====
UNESCO advocates for the creation of national legislation on [[freedom of information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/2017/66&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations Official Document|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Safety of journalists ====
{{Main|Safety of Journalists}}
Safety of journalists is the ability for [[journalist]]s and media professionals to get, produce and share information without facing physical or moral threats. UNESCO's Freedom of Expression Section&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt; and [[International Programme for the Development of Communication]] (IPDC) develop projects to address issues of safety of journalism and impunity in the field.  [[UNESCO]] also celebrates [[World Press Freedom Day]] every year on May 3 during which the Guillermo Cano Prize&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/prizes/guillermo-cano|title=UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; is attributed to honor the work of an individual or an organization defending or promoting freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/commemorations/worldpressfreedomday|title=World Press Freedom Day|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== IPDC's follow-up on SDG 16 =====
The [[International Programme for the Development of Communication]] is responsible for the follow-up of the SDG 16 through indicators 16.10.1 and 16.10.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/|title=SDG Indicators â SDG Indicators|first=United Nations Statistics|last=Division|website=unstats.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every two years, a report containing information from the Member States on the status of judicial inquiries on each of the killings condemned by UNESCO is submitted to the IPDC Council by UNESCO's Director-General.&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002460/246014E.pdf

https://en.unesco.org/programme/ipdc/initiatives&lt;/ref&gt; The journalists safety indicators are a tool developed by UNESCO which, according to UNESCO's website, aims on mapping the key features that can help assess safety of journalists, and help determine whether adequate follow-up is given to crimes committed against them.&lt;ref&gt;For international-level indicators see: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002608/260892E.pdf For national-level indicators see: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002608/260893E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The IPDC Talks also allow the Programme to raise awareness on the importance of [[access to information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/powering-sustainable-development-access-information/about-ipdctalks|title=About the IPDCtalks|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPDC is also the programme that monitors and reports on access to information laws around the world through the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] global report on follow-up to SDGs.

=== Organizations ===

==== Transparency International ====
The anti-corruption non-governmental organization [[Transparency International]] monitors corruption in over a hundred countries and aims to "gives voice to the victims and witnesses of corruption" and "stop the abuse of power, bribery and secret deals".

The term has since been adopted as the name of numerous groups, schools, and businesses.

==Architecture and planning==
A group of architects, landscape architects, and urban planners from the [[Bay Area]], founded in late 1939 through the merging of two groups of [[architects]], one from [[San Francisco]] and the other from the [[University of California]], Berkeley, called themselves Telesis. Philosophically, the group also evolved from several larger international architectural movements, which included CIAM ([[CongrÃ¨s International d'Architecture Moderne]]) and MARS ([[MARS Group|Modern Architectural Research Group]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Serge Chermayeff|Chermayeff, Serge]], "Telesis: The Birth of a Group." ''New Pencil Points'' (July 1942), pp.&amp;nbsp;45&amp;ndash;48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their stated aim was to research the development and implications of what architectural critic [[Lewis Mumford]] called the Second Bay Area Regional Style. As set forth in their founding statement, the group believed that "People and the Land make up the environment which has four distinct parts--a place to Live, Work, Play, and the Services which integrate these and make them operate. These components must be integrated in the community and urban region through rational planning, and through the use of modern building technology."âfrom ''The Things Telesis Has Found Important''

Noted Telesis members included [[William Wurster]], [[Catherine Bauer Wurster]], [[Vernon DeMars]], [[Thomas Dolliver Church|Thomas Church]], [[Garrett Eckbo]], [[Grace Morley|Grace McCann Morley]], [[Geraldine Scott|Geraldine Knight Scott]], [[Joseph Allen Stein]], Jack Hillmer, Francis Violich, and T. J. Kent, Jr. In addition to internal research and [[working group]]s that investigated such topics as speculative housing, industrial design, and the relationship of the physical environment of the San Francisco Bay Area to indigenous architectural styles, the group also organized several influential exhibitions on contemporary architecture and planning with the support of the San Francisco Museum of Art. Professional and personal papers from many of Telesis's members are collected in the [http://www.ced.berkeley.edu/cedarchives/ Environmental Design Archives] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

==Sociology==

The mechanics of society fall under two general groups: social statics and social dynamics. Social dynamics is further divided into social genesis and social telesis. Social telesis may be further divided into individual telesis and collective telesis.&lt;ref&gt;Outlines of Sociology, Lester F. Ward, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Telesis: Progress consciously planned and produced by intelligently directed effort.&lt;ref&gt;L. F. Ward, Outlines of Sociol., p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Social telesis: The intelligent direction of social activity towards the achievement of a desired and understood end.&lt;ref name="WardOutlines"&gt;L. F. Ward, Outlines of Sociol., p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Collective telesis: Adaptation of means to ends by society.&lt;ref&gt;L. F. Ward, Outlines of SocioL, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Individual telesis: The conscious adaptation of conduct by an individual to the achievement of his own consciously apprehended ends.&lt;ref name="WardOutlines" /&gt;

==Philosophy==

Telesis (Greek: Telos, end, + -osis, condition), defined as "the intelligent direction of effort toward the achievement of an end.", has also been a term used in the context of [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]] to refer to "infocognitive potential", a concept originating from [[Christopher Langan]] and his theory of everything, the CTMU.  In his 2002 paper on the CTMU, Langan defines telesis in the following passage:&lt;ref&gt;Langan, C.M. 2002. [http://www.megafoundation.org/CTMU/Articles/Langan_CTMU_092902.pdf] ''The Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe: A New Kind of Reality Theory'' pg. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Laws do not stand on their own, but must be defined with respect to the objects and attributes on which they act and which they accept as parameters. Similarly, objects and attributes do not stand on their own, but must be defined with respect to the rules of structure, organization and transformation that govern them. It follows that the active medium of cross-definition possesses logical primacy over laws and arguments alike, and is thus pre-informational and pre-nomological in natureâ¦i.e., telic. Telesis, which can be characterized as âinfocognitive potentialâ, is the primordial active medium from which laws and their arguments and parameters emerge by mutual refinement or telic recursion.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8053">'''Textual scholarship''' (or '''textual studies''') is an [[umbrella term]] for disciplines that deal with describing, transcribing, editing or annotating [[text (literary theory)|text]]s and physical [[document]]s. 

==Overview==
Textual research is mainly historically oriented. Textual [[scholar]]s study, for instance, how writing practices and printing technology has developed, how a certain writer has written and revised his or her texts, how literary documents have been edited, the history of reading culture, as well as censorship and the authenticity of texts. The subjects, methods and theoretical backgrounds of textual research vary widely, but what they have in common is an interest in the genesis and derivation of texts and textual variation in these practices.

There are many ways to think if you are a textual scholar, some are interested in what the author is trying to intend or there are those who seek to see how the text is transmitted. Textual scholars produce their own editions of what they discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textualscholarship.org/|title=Textual Scholarship|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disciplines of textual scholarship include, among others, [[textual criticism]], [[stemmatology]], [[paleography]], [[genetic editing|genetic criticism]] (critique gÃ©nÃ©tique), [[bibliography]] and [[history of the book]]. Textual scholar [[David Greetham (textual scholar)|David Greetham]] has described textual scholarship as a term encompassing "the procedures of enumerative bibliographers, descriptive, analytical, and historical bibliographers, paleographers and codicologists, textual editors, and annotators-cumulatively and collectively".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greetham|first1=David C.|title=Textual Scholarship: An Introduction|date=1992|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=0-8153-0058-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some disciplines of textual scholarship focus on certain material sources or text genres, such as [[epigraphy]], [[codicology]] and [[diplomatics]]. 

The historical roots of textual scholarship date back to the 3rd century BCE, when the scholarly activities of copying, comparing, describing and archiving texts became professionalized in the [[Library of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;Greetham, David C.:  ''Textual Scholarship.

In [[human sexuality]], '''top''', '''bottom''' and '''versatile''' are [[sex position]]s during [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], especially [[Men who have sex with men|between two men]]. A top is usually a person who [[Sexual penetration|penetrates]], a bottom is usually one who receives penetration, and a versatile engages in both activities or is open to engaging in either activity. These terms may be elements of [[self-identity]] that indicate an individual's usual preference, but might also describe broader sexual identities.&lt;ref name="Underwood"&gt;{{cite book | author =Steven Gregory Underwood|title =Gay men and anal eroticism: tops, bottoms, and versatiles|isbn = 1-56023-375-3|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2003|pages=225 pages|accessdate=2011-12-02|url=https://books.google.com/?id=i4wRl0_8NuUC&amp;pg=PA4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Top,'' ''bottom'' and ''versatile'' are also used in [[BDSM]] to describe unrelated identities and practices.

==Top==
A top is usually a person who engages in the penetrative role during sexual activity; for [[Men who have sex with men|men who have sex with men (MSMs)]], this often involves penetration using the [[Human penis|penis]] during [[Anal sex|anal]] or [[Oral sex|oral]] sex.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt; ''Top'' is also used as a verb meaning "to penetrate another". ''Top'' may also describe a broader [[self-identity|personal identity]] involving [[Dominance and submission|dominance]] in a [[romantic relationship|romantic]] or [[sexual relationship]]; however, this stipulation is not a requisite element of being a top.

Several related terms exist. With regard to gay male sexuality, a ''{{visible anchor|total top}}'' is one who assumes an exclusively penetrative role for sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gremore|first1=Graham|title=What Do You Do When Your Total Top Boyfriend Refuses To Bottom?|url=http://www.queerty.com/what-do-you-do-when-your-total-top-boyfriend-refuses-to-bottom-20150504|accessdate=24 July 2015|work=Queerty|date=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''{{visible anchor|power top}}'' is one noted for their great skill or aggressiveness in topping.  A ''{{visible anchor|service top}}'' is "one who tops under the direction of an eager bottom".&lt;ref name="DJ Symptomatic"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Carissa|title=It's Symptomatic|url=http://www.documentjournal.com/article/its-symptomatic...-by-carissa-rodriguez|website=Document Journal|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''{{visible anchor|versatile top}}'' is one who prefers to top but who bottoms occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaylife.about.com/od/lovesex/g/versatiletop.htm Versatile Top].

Trevor Hart of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) found that self-identified tops were more likely to act as the penetrative partner in other sexual activities (besides anal intercourse), including oral sex and [[sex toy]] play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bering |first=Jesse |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=gay-male-sex-roles |title=Top Scientists Get to the Bottom of Gay Male Sex Role Preferences |publisher=[[Scientific American]]|accessdate=2011-01-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319014720/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=gay-male-sex-roles|archivedate=2011-03-19|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bottom==

A bottom is usually the receptive partner during sexual penetration. This frequently refers to MSMs who are penetrated through the [[Human anus|anus]] during anal sex.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt; ''Bottom'' is also used as a verb meaning "to be penetrated by another, whether anally or orally". ''Bottom'' may also describe a wider social context of [[Dominance and submission|submission]] within a romantic or sexual relationship, though this element does not apply to all people who prefer to bottom.

In gay male sexuality, a ''total bottom'' is someone who assumes an exclusively passive or receptive role during anal or oral intercourse. A ''{{visible anchor|power bottom}}'' is someone who aggressively enjoys being the receptive partner.  A ''{{visible anchor|versatile bottom}}'' is one who prefers to bottom but who tops occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaylife.about.com/od/lovesex/g/versatilebottom.htm Versatile Bottom]. Gaylife.about.com (2012-01-01). Retrieved on 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; The term {{visible anchor|receiver}} or {{visible anchor|receptive partner}} may be preferred by some. An ''oral bottom'' (alternatively described as being the "oral active" partner) is the exclusively receptive partner in oral sex, providing the penetrative partner, or ''oral top'' (alternatively described as being the "oral passive" partner), with unreciprocated [[fellatio]] and [[irrumatio]].

==Versatile==

''Versatile'' refers to a person who enjoys both topping and bottoming, or being dominant and submissive, and may alternate between the two in sexual situations.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 17879166|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Role+versatility+among+men+who+have+sex+with+men+in+urban+Peru.-a0168586762 |title=Role versatility among men who have sex with men in urban Peru|year= 2007|last1= Goodreau|first1= SM|last2= Peinado|first2= J|last3= Goicochea|first3= P|last4= Vergara|first4= J|last5= Ojeda|first5= N|last6= Casapia|first6= M|last7= Ortiz|first7= A|last8= Zamalloa|first8= V|last9= Galvan|first9= R|last10=Sanchez |first10=Jorge R. |volume= 44|issue= 3|pages= 233â9|doi= 10.1080/00224490701443676|journal= Journal of Sex Research|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maennerarzt-linz.at/index.php?id=84 "MÃ¤nner, die sowohl passiven als auch aktiven Analsex praktizieren, nennt man ''versatile''."] Georg Pfau, PrÃ¤ventionsmedizin fÃ¼r den Mann, Linz 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''Flip-flop'' or ''flip fuck'' commonly describes switching from top to bottom during one sexual encounter between two men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18288599|author=Michael D. Smith, David W. Seal|title= Motivational Influences on the Safer Sex Behavior of Agency-based Male Sex Workers|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume =37|issue= 5|year= 2008|pages=845â53|doi=10.1007/s10508-008-9341-1|last2=Seal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each participant penetrates the other and is penetrated in his turn.

Versatility is a concept of [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].&lt;ref name="martinplevine1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levine |first=Martin P. |authorlink= |author2=Kimmel, Michael S.  |title=Gay Macho: The Life and Death of the homosexual Clone |year=1998 |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Versatility'', though, is not limited to the simple acts of anal, oral, or vaginal penetration, but also includes the splitting of duties and responsibilities in the relationship.&lt;ref name="jayyoung1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jay |first=Karla |authorlink= |author2=Young, Allen  |title=The gay report: Lesbians and gay men speak out about sexual experiences and lifestyles |year=1979 |publisher=Summit |location=New York |isbn=0-671-40013-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The reciprocal scenario, where both men take turns fucking each other, is often exercised as a celebration of equality. What sets this scenario apart from the others is the versatility of the men involved. Versatility is a unique and important feature of male anal sex. Some men consider it liberating;&amp;nbsp;... Versatility to them is akin to speaking two different languages. It requires a special kind of playfulness, creativity, curiosity, and coordination. |Steven G. Underwood|''Gay Men and anal eroticism: tops, bottoms, and versatiles'', Harrington Park Press 2003}}

According to some, living a ''versatile lifestyle'' implies a certain openness to new things and an opposition to [[labels]], [[stereotype]]s and [[generalization]]s. Therefore, this concept differs from heterosexual relationships where sexual compatibility does not begin with guessing who will end up as top or bottom.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt;
In self descriptions of men seeking sex with other men, they may refer to themselves as a versatile top or versatile bottom in addition to other commonly used terms.

A 2009 Austrian study on [[gay pornography]] has shown that at least 82.4% of all men performing in the male [[porn industry]] are versatile at some point during their career. In this study, the performances of 5,556 actors were considered. 10.8% performed only in the top role, 6.8% only as bottoms. The study also found that the actor with the [[human penis size|larger penis]] was more likely to act as the top.&lt;ref&gt;Michelides, Christian: ''MÃ¤nnlichkeitskonstruktionen der Pornografie zur Jahrtausendwende,'' Wien 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Versatility is a common theme of [[erotic artist]] [[Tom of Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Arell| first = Berndt  | last2 = Mustola  | first2 = Kati | title = Tom of Finland: EnnennÃ¤kemÃ¤tÃ¶ntÃ¤ â Unforeseen  | publisher = Like| year = 2006 | isbn = 952-471-843-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[trans men]] who still have a [[vagina]], topping and bottoming can also involve penile penetration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hivplusmag.com/sex-dating/2015/11/23/gay-sex-ed-staying-safe-while-topping-or-bottoming |title=Gay Sex Ed: Staying Safe While Topping or Bottoming |publisher=[[LPI Media|HIV Plus Magazine]] |accessdate=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role vs. position among sexualities==

''Top'', ''bottom'' and ''versatile'', with regard to sexual activity between males, refer specifically to the penetrative role, regardless of the physical positioning during sex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaylife.about.com/od/anal/a/amitoporbottom.htm Topping or Bottoming â How To Know If You're A Top Or Bottom]. Gaylife.about.com (2012-01-01). Retrieved on 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in positions where the inserting partner lies on his back and the receptive partner straddles the inserting partner, the inserting partner is still considered to assume the "top" role, even though he is positioned on the bottom (and vice versa). When used in reference to heterosexual and [[Lesbian sexual practices|lesbian sex]], the terms ''top,'' ''bottom'' and ''versatile'' usually refer only to position and not to the penetrative role.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Prevalence==

No scientific study has ever been conducted as to what percentage of the gay and bisexual male population prefers any given role. The popular assumption is that the majority prefer to bottom and that those who prefer to top are in the minority. A tally of 55,464 profiles on [[gay.com]] from the [[United States]] showed that 26.46% preferred top, while 31.92% preferred bottom, and the largest group (41.62%) preferred versatile. The preferences seemed to vary by state, however. In Wyoming, for example, 16% preferred top, 44% preferred bottom, and 40% preferred versatile. In West Virginia, tops outnumbered bottoms by a slim margin (32% top, 29% bottom, and 39% versatile). In Oregon, "versatile" profiles made up nearly half (48.42%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightacting.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?p=222697#p222697 Best states for tops, bottoms, versatiles]. Straightacting.com. Retrieved on 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==BDSM==

In [[BDSM]], the terms ''top'', ''bottom'' and ''switch'' are related, but are a BDSM-distinct phenomenon. BDSM seems to have adopted and [[derivation (linguistics)|derived]] these terms as [[loan words]] from [[gay culture]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Other==

In the [[hanky code]], a person flagging the top or active  role would wear the hanky in the left pocket, the bottom or passive role on the right. Acts which were not divisible into distinct roles however, such as "69" or "anything" followed a pattern where one flagged interest by wearing the hanky on the right, uninterest by wearing it on the left, and preferences that did not relate to sexual mechanics, such as uniform fetishism or prostitution, followed a pattern where the seeker flagged on the left and the object of desire flagged on the right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://user.xmission.com/~trevin/hanky.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''side'' has been proposed by Huffington Post contributor [[Joe Kort]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joe-kort-phd/guys-on-the-side-looking-beyond-gay-tops-and-bottoms_b_3082484.html Guys on the 'Side': Looking Beyond Gay Tops and Bottoms] Huffingtonpost.com Retrieved 2014-10-02&lt;/ref&gt; for gay men who are not interested in anal sex.

Transparency is practiced in companies, organizations, administrations, and communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opening government: A guide to best practice in transparency, accountability and civic engagement across the public sector|url=http://www.transparency-initiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Opening-Government3.pdf|website=Transparency Initiative|publisher=Transparency &amp; Accountability Initiative|accessdate=September 11, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218030712/http://www.transparency-initiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Opening-Government3.pdf|archivedate=February 18, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It guides an organization's decisions and policies on the disclosure of information to its employees and the public, or simply the intended recipient of the information.&lt;ref name='JOM'&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schnackenberg | first1 = Andrew K. | last2 = Tomlinson | first2 = Edward C. | title = Organizational transparency: a new perspective on managing trust in organization-stakeholder relationships | journal = [[Journal of Management]] | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0149206314525202 | date = March 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0149206314525202 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} Published online before print.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a cashier making change after a point of sale transaction by offering a record of the items purchased (e.g., a receipt) as well as counting out the customer's change on the counter demonstrates one type of transparency.

The term '''transparency''' has a very different meaning in Information Security where it is used to describe security mechanisms that are intentionally in-detectable or hidden from view.  Examples include hiding utilities and tools which the user does not need to know in order to do their job, like keeping the remote re-authentication operations of Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol hidden from the user.

In 2009, the Spanish government for the first time released information on how much each cabinet member is worth, but data on ordinary citizens is private.

==Management==
[[File:Shimer College dialogue transparency 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Shimer College]] students demonstrate in favor of transparency in school administration, 2010]]
Recent research suggests there are three primary aspects of transparency relevant to management practice: information disclosure, clarity, and accuracy.&lt;ref name='JOM'/&gt; To increase transparency, managers actively infuse greater disclosure, clarity, and accuracy into their communications with [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]]. For example, managers that voluntarily share information related to the firm's ecological impact with environmental activists are demonstrating disclosure; managers that limit the use of [[technical terminology]], [[fine print]], or complicated mathematical notations in their correspondence with suppliers and customers are demonstrating clarity; and managers that do not bias, embellish, or otherwise distort known facts in their communications with investors are demonstrating accuracy. The ''strategic'' management of transparency therefore involves intentional modifications in disclosure, clarity, and accuracy to accomplish the organization's specific objectives.&lt;ref name='JOM'/&gt;

Alternatively, [[radical transparency]] is a [[management]] method where nearly all decision making is carried out publicly. All draft documents, all arguments for and against a proposal, all final decisions, and the decision making process itself are made public and remain publicly archived. This approach has grown in popularity with the rise of the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1= Marcia W. | last1= DiStaso | first2= Denise Sevick | last2= Bortree | title= Ethical practice of social media in public relations | page= 23 | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 9781317917908 | year= 2014 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=MujpAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; Two examples of organizations utilizing this style are the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community and [[Indymedia]].

[[Corporate transparency]], a form of [[radical transparency]], is the concept of removing all barriers to âand the facilitating ofâ free and easy public access to corporate information and the laws, rules, social [[connivance]] and processes that facilitate and protect those individuals and corporations that freely join, develop, and improve the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1= Bernardi | first1= Richard A. |last2= LaCross |first2= Catherine C. | title= Corporate transparency: code of ethics disclosures | url= http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2005/405/essentials/p34.htm | work= The CPA Journal | publisher= New York State Society of the Certified Public Accountants (CPA) | date= April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-governmental organizations===
Accountability and transparency are of high relevance for [[non-governmental organisation]]s (NGOs). In view of their responsibilities to stakeholders, including donors, sponsors, programme beneficiaries, staff, states and the public, they are considered to be of even greater importance to them than to commercial undertakings.&lt;ref name="huidobro-p60"&gt;{{Cite book | first1= Maria | last1= Francesch-Huidobro | title= Governance, politics and the environment: a Singapore study | page= 60 | publisher = Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS) | isbn = 9789812308313 | year= 2008 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=QrCqBmdZY5UC&amp;pg=PA60 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet these same values are often found to be lacking in NGOs.&lt;ref name="huidobro-p60"/&gt;

The ''[[INGO Accountability Charter|International NGO Accountability Charter]]'', linked to the [[Global Reporting Initiative]], documents the commitment of its members [[international NGO]]s to accountability and transparency, requiring them to submit an annual report, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Is GRI too much transparency for NGOs? | url = http://prizmablog.com/2011/03/27/is-gri-too-much-transparency-porn-for-ngos/ | publisher = PRIZMA | date = March 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Our accountability commitments: transparency | url = http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/home/our-accountability-commitments/transparency/ | publisher = INGO accountability charter | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150329081613/http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/home/our-accountability-commitments/transparency/ | archivedate = 2015-03-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Signed in 2006 by 11 NGOs active in the area of humanitarian rights, the INGO Accountability Charter has been referred to as the âfirst global accountability charter for the non-profit sectorâ.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Thompson | first = Andrew S. | contribution = Laying the groundwork: Considerations for a charter for a proposed global civi society forum | editor-last1 = Walker | editor-first1 = James W.

==Media==
{{Main|Media transparency}}
[[Media transparency]] is the concept of determining how and why [[information]] is conveyed through various means.

If the media and the public knows everything that happens in all authorities and county administrations there will be a lot of questions, protests and suggestions coming from media and the public. People who are interested in a certain issue will try to influence the decisions. Transparency creates an everyday participation in the political processes by media and the public. One tool used to increase everyday participation in political processes is [[freedom of information]] legislation and requests. Modern [[democracy]] builds on such participation of the people and media.

There are, for anybody who is interested, many ways to influence the decisions at all levels in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1= Moeller | first1= Susan D. | title= Openness &amp; accountability: a study of transparency in global media outlets | url= http://www.icmpa.umd.edu/pages/studies/transparency/main.html | work= Studies | publisher= International Center for Media and the Public Agenda (ICMPA) | display-authors= etal | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080515174519/http://www.icmpa.umd.edu/pages/studies/transparency/main.html | archivedate= 2008-05-15 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2011}}
[[File:Seal of Good Housekeeping plaque Santa Barbara Pangasinan.jpg|thumb|A 2011 [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] recognizing the municipality of [[Santa Barbara, Pangasinan]] for its "efforts in advancing the principles of [[accountability]] and transparency in [[local governance]]." ]]
The right and the means to examine the process of decision making is known as transparency.
In politics, transparency is used as a means of holding [[official|public officials]] [[accountability|accountable]] and fighting [[political corruption|corruption]]. When a [[government]]'s meetings are open to the [[Mass media|press]] and the public, its [[budgets]] may be reviewed by anyone, and its laws and decisions are open to discussion, it is seen as transparent. It is not clear however if this provides less opportunity for the authorities to abuse the system for their own interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Mattozzi | first1= Andrea | last2 = Merlo | first2 = Antonio | title = The transparency of politics and the quality of politicians | journal = [[American Economic Review]] | volume = 97 | issue = 2 | pages = 311â315 | publisher = [[American Economic Association]] | doi = 10.1257/aer.97.2.311 | date = May 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1257/aer.97.2.311 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://people.hss.caltech.edu/~andrea/transparency.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

When military authorities [[classified information|classify]] their plans as secret, transparency is absent. This can be seen as either positive or negative; positive because it can increase [[national security]], negative because it can lead to corruption and, in extreme cases, a [[military dictatorship]].

While a [[liberal democracy]] can be a [[plutocracy]], where decisions are made behind locked doors and the people have fewer possibilities to influence politics between the elections, a [[participative democracy]] is more closely connected to the will of the people.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Participative democracy, built on transparency and everyday participation, has been used officially in northern [[Europe]] for decades. In the northern European [[country]] [[Sweden]], [[Constitution of Sweden#Public access to governmental documents|public access to government documents]] became a law as early as 1766. It has officially been adopted as an ideal to strive for by the rest of EU, leading to measures like [[Freedom of information laws by country|freedom of information laws]] and [[Lobby register|laws for lobby transparency]].

To promote transparency in [[politics]], [[Hans Peter Martin]], [[Paul van Buitenen]] ([[Europa Transparant]]) and [[Ashley Mote]] decided to cooperate under the name [[Platform for Transparency]] (PfT) in 2005. Similar organizations that promotes transparency are [[Transparency International]] and the [[Sunlight Foundation]].

A recent political movement to emerge in conjunction with the demands for transparency is the [[Pirate Party]], a label for a number of political parties across different countries who advocate freedom of information, direct democracy, network neutrality, and the free sharing of knowledge.

==Online culture==

21st century culture affords a higher level of public transparency than ever before, and actually requires it in many cases.  Modern technology and associated culture shifts have changed how government works (see [[WikiLeaks]]), what information people can find out about each other, and the ability of politicians to stay in office if they are involved in [[sex scandals]]. Due to the [[digital revolution]], people no longer have a high level of control over what is public information, leading to a tension between the values of transparency and [[privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Digital person: technology and privacy in the information age|page=140 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0814798462|isbn=0814798462 |first=Daniel J. |last=Solove|year= 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

[[research|Scholarly research]] in any [[scientific method|academic discipline]] may also be labeled as (partly) transparent (or [[open research]]) if some or all relevant aspects of the research are open in the sense of [[open source]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rocchini | first1 = Duccio | last2 = Neteler | first2 = Markus | title = Let the four freedoms paradigm apply to ecology | journal = [[Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution]] | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 310â311 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2012.03.009 | date = June 2012 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2012.03.009 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] and [[open data]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wissenschaftsrat.de/engl_start.htm|title=Wissenschaftsrat: Home|work=wissenschaftsrat.de|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417091550/http://www.wissenschaftsrat.de/engl_start.htm|archivedate=2010-04-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby facilitating [[Recognition (sociology)|social recognition]] and [[accountability]] of the scholars who did the research and [[Reproducibility|replication]] by others interested in the matters addressed by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v3/n1/full/embor241.html|title=Transparent science| volume=3|doi=10.1093/embo-reports/kvf018|pages=9â11|journal=EMBO Reports|pmc=1083937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[mathematicians]] and scientists are critical of using closed source [[mathematical software]] such as [[Mathematica]] for [[mathematical proofs]], because these do not provide transparency, and thus are not verifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/title/Mathematica+and+free+software|title=Mathematica and free software|work=everything2.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open-source software such as [[SageMath]] aims to solve this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news116173009.html|title=Free software brings affordability, transparency to mathematics|publisher=physorg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

In the computer software world, [[open source software]] concerns the creation of software, to which access to the underlying [[source code]] is freely available. This permits use, study, and modification without restriction.

In computer security, the debate is ongoing as to the relative merits of the [[Full disclosure (computer security)|full disclosure]] of security vulnerabilities, versus a [[Security through obscurity|security-by-obscurity]] approach.

There is a different (perhaps almost opposite) sense of [[Transparency (humanâcomputer interaction)|transparency in human-computer interaction]], whereby a system after change adheres to its previous external interface as much as possible while changing its internal behaviour. That is, a change in a system is transparent to its users if the change is unnoticeable to them.

==Sports==

[[Sports]] has become a global business over the last century, and here, too, initiatives ranging from mandatory drug testing to the fighting of sports-related corruption are gaining ground based on the transparent activities in other domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparencyinsport.org/|title=Transparency in Sport|work=transparencyinsport.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2011}}

==Criticism==

[[Sigmund Freud]] following [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] ("On Truth and Lie in a Nonmoral Sense") regularly argues that transparency is impossible because of the occluding function of the unconscious.

Among philosophical and literary works that have examined the idea of transparency are [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' or [[David Brin]]'s ''[[The Transparent Society]]''. 
The German philosopher and media theorist [[Byung-Chul Han]] in his 2012 work ''Transparenzgesellschaft'' sees transparency as a cultural norm created by neoliberal market forces, which he understands as the insatiable drive toward voluntary disclosure bordering on the pornographic. According to Han, the dictates of transparency enforce a totalitarian system of openness at the expense of other social values such as shame, secrecy, and trust. He was criticized for his concepts, as they would suggest corrupt politics and for referring to the anti-democratic Carl Schmitt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Klarheit schaffen|url=http://www.freitag.de/kultur/1223-klarheit-schaffen|work=der Freitag | language = German |date=7 June 2012 |accessdate= 3 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists have long explored ethnographically the relation between revealed and concealed knowledges, and have increasingly taken up the topic in relation to accountability, transparency and conspiracy theories and practices today.&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, M. 2000.

Birchall, assessed in an article "[...] whether the ascendance of transparency as an ideal limits political thinking, particularly for western socialists and radicals struggling to seize opportunities for change [...]". She argues that the promotion of 'datapreneurial' activity through open data initiatives outsources and interrupts the political contract between governed and government. She is concerned that the dominant model of governmental data-driven transparency produces neoliberal subjectivities that reduce the possibility of politics as an arena of dissent between real alternatives. She suggests that the radical Left might want to work with and reinvent secrecy as an alternative to neoliberal transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Birchall | first = Clare | title = Transparency interrupted: secrets of the left | journal = [[Theory, Culture &amp; Society]] | volume = 28 | issue = 7â8 | pages = 60â84 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0263276411423040 | date = December 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0263276411423040 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Religijne symbole0.png|thumb|right|The world religions paradigm selects a small number of religious groups which it classes as 'major'.]]
'''World religions''' is a category used in the [[Religious studies|study of religion]] to demarcate the fiveâand in some cases sixâlargest and most internationally widespread religious movements. [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]] are always included in the list, being known as the "Big Five". Some scholars also include another religion, such as [[Sikhism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], or the [[BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith]], in the category. 

The world religions paradigm was developed in the United Kingdom in the 1960s, where it was pioneered by [[phenomenology of religion|phenomenological]] scholars like [[Ninian Smart]]. It was designed to broaden the study of religion away from its heavy focus on Christianity by taking into account other large religious traditions around the world.  
The paradigm is often used by lecturers instructing undergraduate students in the study of religion and is also the framework used by school teachers in the UK and other countries. The paradigm's emphasis on viewing these religious movements as distinct and mutually exclusive entities has also had a wider impact on the categorisation of religionâfor instance in censusesâin both Western countries and elsewhere.

Since the late twentieth century, the paradigm has faced critique by scholars of religion like [[Jonathan Z. Smith]], some of whom have argued for its abandonment. Critics have argued that the world religions paradigm is inappropriate because it takes the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] variant of Christianity as the model for what constitutes religion; that it is tied up with discourses of modernity, including modern power relations; that it encourages an uncritical understanding of religion; and that it makes a value judgement as to what religions should be considered "major". Others have argued that it remains useful in the classroom, so long as students are made aware that it is a socially constructed category.

==Definition==

The scholars of religion Christopher R. Cotter and David G. Robertson described the "World Religions Paradigm" as "a particular way of thinking about religions which organizes them into a set of discrete traditions with a supposedly 'global' import."{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016a|p=vii}} It typically consists of the "Big Five" religions: [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Owen|1y=2011|1p=254|2a1=Cotter|2a2=Robertson|2y=2016b|2p=2}} 
As noted by Cotter and Robertson, the "Big Five" religions are often listed in an "Abrahamocentric order" which places the largest three [[Abrahamic religions]]âChristianity, Judaism, and Islamâbefore the non-Abrahamic religions Hinduism and Buddhism.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=2}} The category is sometimes also extended to include other religious groups, namely [[Sikhism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], and the [[BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith]].{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}}

The inclusion of Judaism in the Big Five raises some issues; it is included in the list because of its influence on Christianity and Islam and because of its relevance to traditional Western understandings of Western history.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=80}} On demographic grounds, it does not fit into the list, for there are far fewer Jews in the world than there are Christians, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=80}} Similarly, it does not fit into the list if the groups are defined by a desire to spread internationally, because Judaism is typically non-proselytizing.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=80}}

Many scholars have utilised the "World Religions" category alongside other "catch-all" categories such as "[[new religious movements]]" and "[[indigenous religions]]".{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=2}} The scholar Steven J. Sutcliffe compared the relationship between the three categories to the [[English football league system]], with the "world" religions forming a [[Premier League]], the "new" religions forming a [[EFL Championship|Championship]], and "indigenous" religions a [[Football League First Division|First Division]].{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2016|p=26}} That groups that get placed in categories like "indigenous religions" get treated less seriously than the "world religions" by many scholars was noted by the scholar of religion Graham Harvey, who maintained that "indigenous religions should receive similarly respectful treatment to that considered appropriate to the larger 'World Religions'."{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=3}}

==History==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=While the World Religions paradigm was brought in to allow the inclusion of non-Christian religions in education, it has instead remodelled them according to liberal Western Protestant Christian values (akin to what the [[Church of England]] promotes), emphasizing theological categories..|source=â Scholar of religion Suzanne Owen, 2011{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} }}

Cotter and Robertson noted that the history of the world religions paradigm is "intimately tied up" with the history of the study of religion as an academic discipline.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=3}} It emerged from within the [[phenomenology of religion]] approach which placed an emphasis on description rather than critical analysis.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} 

The paradigm was integrated throughout the education system through work of scholars like [[Ninian Smart]], who formed the Shap Working Party on World Religions in Education in 1969.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} It was introduced with the intent of moving Western education away from its focus on Christianity.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} However, it took liberal Western Protestantism as its baseline and interpreted these different religious traditions through the framework of liberal Protestant norms and values.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} This included an emphasis on [[theology]] as being central to a given religion.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} It also reflects the post-Enlightenment Christian approach of treating different religious groups as distinct, mutually exclusive categories.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=260}} It thus reflects the socio-political concerns of 1960s Britain, the environment in which it was devised.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=259}}

The paradigm has since gone beyond this academic discipline, and "informs the perception" of many members of different religious groups.{{sfn|Ramey|2016|p=50}} The paradigm for instance frames the teaching about religion in the British education system; at all three [[Key Stage]]s, British teachers are instructed to teach about Christianity, while by the end of key Stage 3 they are also supposed to teach about the other "five principal religions": Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=263}} Similarly, the censuses of many countries for instance reflect the influence of the world religion paradigm by only permitting respondents to describe themselves as adhering to one particular religious tradition, whereas in reality many individuals identify themselves with various different traditions at the same time.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=260}} This idea of mutually exclusive religious identities is not only a Western phenomenon, but can also be found in other socio-cultural contexts; [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalists]] for instance often endorse the idea that Hinduism and Buddhism are mutually exclusive categories despite the fact that many people in South Asia mix Hindu and Buddhist practices.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=260}}
The scholars of religion Tara Baldrick-Morrone, Michael Graziano, and Brad Stoddard stated that "the WRP is neither neutral nor natural, but its social authority derives from appearing as both."{{sfn|Baldrick-Morrone|Graziano|Stoddard|2016|p=38}}

==Criticism==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=[A 'world religion' is] a tradition that has achieved sufficient power and numbers to enter our history to form it, interact with it, or thwart it. We recognise both the unity within and the diversity among the world religions because they correspond to important geopolitical entities with which we must deal. All 'primitives,' by way of contrast, may be lumped together, as may the 'minor religions,' because they do not confront our history in any direct fashion. From the point of view of power, they are invisible.|source=â Scholar of religion [[J. Z. Smith]], 1998{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=8}} }}

The utility of the  World Religions Paradigm has experienced a sustained and rigorous critique from many scholars of religion.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} In 1978, the scholar of religion [[Jonathan Z. Smith]] for example called it a "dubious category".{{sfn|Smith|1978|p=295}}

One of the major criticisms of the framework is that it is based on a model of 'religion' that is highly reliant on using the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] version of Christianity as its base example.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} A second criticism is that it is rooted in the discourses of modernity, including the [[power relations]] present in modern society.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} Smith observed that it was constructed by Western scholars from a Western perspective. He noted that the only religions that get included in it are those which have "achieved sufficient power and numbers to enter our [i.e. Western] history, either to form it, interact with it, or to thwart it" and represent "important geo-political entities with which we must deal."{{sfn|Smith|1978|p=295}} The framework also includes privileging the literate elites active in particular religious movements by presenting their interpretations of particular traditions as being authoritative, eclipsing alternative interpretations presented by non-literate, marginalised, and localized practitioners.{{sfnm|1a1=Owen|1y=2011|1p=255|2a1=Cotter|2a2=Robertson|2y=2016b|2pp=8â9}} For instance, as noted by the scholar of religion Suzanne Owen, "Hinduism as a World Religion does not include Hinduism as a village religion".{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=255}}

A third criticism of the world religions paradigm is that it encourages an uncritical and ''sui generis'' model of 'religion'.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} It presents each of the 'world religions' in an abstracted and essentialised form, failing to take account of hybridization.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=259}} For instance, in teaching about Christianity it does not refer to [[reincarnation]], because this is not typically regarded as a Christian doctrine, and yet there are Christians who profess a belief in reincarnation.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=259}}
A fourth criticism is that in choosing to focus attention on the "major" religions, it makes a value judgement as to what constitutes "major" and what does not.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=12}} 

===Paradigm in pedagogy===

Many scholars of religion have resisted efforts to challenge the paradigm,{{sfn|Cox|2016|p=xii}} and as of 2016 was reported as still being widespread in university introductory courses to the study of religion.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=10}} Many instructors feel that explaining the critique of the world religions paradigm to undergraduate students would be difficult, as the critique would be too complex for many of them to understand.{{sfn|Ramey|2016|p=49}} Its continued use has also been defended by the claim that it is what undergraduate students expect and that it mirrors what they will have been taught at school.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}}

Some scholars have argued for the rejection of the world religions paradigm altogether; Cotter and Robertson presented the argument that "the continued uncritical use of the WRP fosters a breeding ground for relativistic navel-gazing which has no place in the contemporary research university".{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=10}} Owen was of the view that "as long as it continues to employ the World Religions paradigm as a default approach (even after deconstructing it), religious studies will fail in its humanistic task" because it will simply be engaging in "knowledge transfer" and not "critically engaging" with "culture and knowledge".{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=257}} One alternative framework that some scholars use to teach about religion is the "[[lived religion]]" paradigm, which places emphasis not on distinct religious traditions but on individual experiences and practices.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=12}} Another alternative is the "[[material religion]]" framework which focuses on examining religion through [[material culture]] and physical objects.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|pp=12â13}} Owen noted that, in her experience, many students display an "initial resistance to alternatives" as they are expecting the world religions paradigm. She cited the example of her introductory course at [[Leeds Trinity University College]], which was constructed on thematic lines rather than according to the world religions paradigm, and which induced feelings of panic among many undergraduates.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}}

Many scholars who are critical of the world religions paradigm find themselves having to teach it as part of introductory courses for undergraduate students.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} Some spent much of a course teaching the concept and then several sessions after this deconstructing it.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} Some scholars have suggested that even when students are taught using the world religions paradigm, it could be a good means of encouraging them to think critically about category formation.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=13}} The scholar Steven W. Ramey for instance advocated teaching the paradigm in a manner that makes it clear that it is a "constructed discourse".{{sfn|Ramey|2016|p=48}} Similarly, Baldrick-Morrone, Graziano, and Stoddard suggested that teaching undergraduates about the world religious paradigm helps to explain to students how "classification is a social act".{{sfn|Baldrick-Morrone|Graziano|Stoddard|2016|p=39}} They noted that students could leave such a course not only knowing more about the specific religious traditions included in the world religions category, but that they would also leave "knowing how to better interrogate the world around them".{{sfn|Baldrick-Morrone|Graziano|Stoddard|2016|p=39}} To avoid promoting the paradigm's portrayal of different religious traditions as rigid, homogenous categories, the scholar Teemu Taira suggested introducing [[ethnography|ethnographic]] case studies into the class to better explain the realities of people's lives and uses of religious traditions.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=82}}
