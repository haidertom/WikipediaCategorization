The '''Advanced Technology Development Center''' (ATDC) is a science and [[business incubator]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. It is part of the [[Enterprise Innovation Institute]] (EI2) at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], and is headquartered in [[Technology Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/supportfac/atdc.php|title=Advanced Technology Development Center|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Support Facilities|accessdate=2007-08-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070817191102/http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/supportfac/atdc.php| archivedate= 17 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ATDC was formed in 1980 to stimulate growth in Georgia's technology business base, and admitted its first member company in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atdc.org/history.asp |title=History |publisher=Advanced Technology Development Center |accessdate=2007-08-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607203832/http://www.atdc.org/history.asp |archivedate=2007-06-07 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It now has locations in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]]. In 2011, ATDC expanded its mission by merging with Georgia Tech’s [[VentureLab]] and with the Georgia SBIR Assistance Program. ATDC has opened its membership to all technology entrepreneurs in Georgia, from those at the earliest conception stage to the well-established, venture-fundable companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atdc.org/about/about|title=About ATDC|publisher=Advanced Technology Development Center|accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buildings are essentially the same as what they were in 2007 before the facility was demolished. The building on the right is the Ocean Engineering facility which housed two wave pools often used by the film industry.]]
[[Image:BC Research sign 26th Jan 2009.JPG|thumb|A sign at the closed facility still in place in early 2009]]
'''BC Research Inc'''. was based at a {{convert|180000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} scientific research and development company located at the BC Research and Innovation Complex at the south end of the [[University of British Columbia]] campus. The facility closed in November 2007. The company specialized in consulting and applied research and development in the area of plant biotechnology and environment, health and safety, process and analysis, transportation and ship dynamics.

The company can be traced back to 1944 as it developed from the non-profit BC Research Council to a private company in 1993, founded by Dr. Hugh Wynne-Edwards, Ph.D, DSc., FRSC, a member of the Order of Canada, who served as the founding Chief Executive Officer and developed the facility into one of Canada's most recognized incubators in the fields of biotechnology, drug discovery and alternative fuel technologies. In 2000, BC Research was purchased by Immune Network Ltd and was sold to Cromedica (now PRA International) in July 2001 for a consideration of $8.3 million according to 2001 audited financials published on [[SEDAR]]. Its plant biotechnology team was mostly spun off in Silvagen Inc. which specialized in clonal reforestation and which became a part of CellFor.  In 1999 Azure Dynamics, a hybrid commercial vehicle systems developer, was formed with some of the transportation team and left the facility in 2004 having gone public in 2001 as [[Azure Dynamics Corporation]]. {{sic|hide=y|Radi|ent}} Technologies, Inc., specializing in microwave-assisted natural product extraction, purification and isolation, was also spun off in 2001 as a joint venture with Environment Canada. The remaining laboratory and consulting business functions continued under the name Vizon SciTec until August 2006 when CANTEST Ltd. announced its acquisition from BC Research Inc. which continues as a privately held technology holding company. 

In May 2007, the former Industrial Process Division of BC Research was acquired by Kemetco Research Inc.  Kemetco provides contract research, process development and laboratory testing services to industry, primarily in mining, metallurgy and chemical processing.  Since inception, Kemetco has grown to be one of the largest privately held contract R&amp;D firms in Canada that services Environmental, Chemical and Mining companies.  Kemetco operates in an {{convert|18000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} state-of-the-art R&amp;D facility in Richmond, British Columbia.  
[[Image:BC Flag from BC Research at Azure Dynamics.JPG|thumb|British Columbia flag which flew in space and was in the lobby of BC Research, flew on at Azure Dynamics, Burnaby, BC until transfer to the new BCRI facility]]

Finally in 2010, BC Research Inc., BCRI, opened again for business in its new research facilities in Burnaby, B.C.  Their board of directors is composed of Kemetco and NORAM Engineering and Constructors Ltd business and technology leaders.  The Company continues to provide specialized consulting and applied research and development in an expanding number of different technologies and  industries, including fluidized beds, storage of energy in batteries, fuel cells, electrochemical cells, corrosion testing and analysis, hydrogen, sulfur, chlorine, nitration, water treatment, and pulp and paper chemistry.
[[File:BC Research 2010 Burnaby.jpg|thumb|The new BC Research facility opened in 2010 and is located in Burnaby, B.C.]]

As of Q4 2016 BCRI is opening a newly constructed facility on Mitchell Island in Vancouver B.C. to expand their capabilities.

The '''BIM Collaboration Format''' ('''BCF''') is a structured file format which allows [[Issue_tracking_system|issue tracking]] with a [[Building information modeling|building information model]]. BCF is designed primarily for attaching information to collisions and errors connected with specific objects in a model, but can be used for general issue tracking in building construction projects. This allows developers of BIM-supporting software to design interfaces for collaboration between users who access the same model, especially with different software.

The format was developed by Tekla and Solibri and later adopted as a standard by [[buildingSMART]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/specifications/bcf-releases |title=BCF intro |website=www.buildingsmart-tech.org |language=en |access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable software with native support for BCF are Solibri, Tekla with plugins which provide usability for other software.

A '''backshop''' or '''back-shop'''{{cn|date=August 2012}} is a specialized store or [[workshop]] found in service industries, such as [[locomotive]] and [[Aircraft maintenance|aircraft repair]].  Most [[repairs]] are carried out in small workshops, except where an industrial service is needed.

In the military, backshops repair parts known as [[shop-replaceable unit]]s (SRUs).  These are commonly stocked subassemblies of a larger system, such as circuit cards components of a [[line-replaceable unit]] (LRU), designed to be repaired at the field level.  Repair at this level is known as field-level maintenance or [[Level of Repair Analysis|intermediate-level (I-level) maintenance]]. 
[[Calibration]] and repair of [[United States Air Force]] [[Electronic test equipment|test equipment]] is conducted at shops known as [[Precision measurement equipment laboratory|precision measurement equipment laboratories]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="126816">This is a '''comparison of orbital launch systems'''. The following exposes the full list of conventional orbital launch systems. For the short simple list of conventional launcher families, see: [[Comparison of orbital launchers families]]. For the list of predominantly solid-fuelled orbital launch systems, see: [[Comparison of solid-fuelled orbital launch systems]].

[[Spacecraft propulsion]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;There are many different methods. Each method has drawbacks and advantages, and spacecraft propulsion is an active area of research. However, most spacecraft today are propelled by forcing a gas from the back/rear of the vehicle at very high speed through a [[rocket engine nozzle|supersonic de Laval nozzle]]. This sort of [[engine]] is called a [[rocket engine]].&lt;/ref&gt; is any [[propulsion|method used to accelerate]] [[spacecraft]] and artificial [[satellite]]s. A conventional [[solid rocket]] or a conventional [[solid-fuel rocket]] is a rocket with a motor that uses [[solid propellant]]s ([[fuel]]/[[oxidizer]]).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The first medieval rockets were solid-fuel rockets powered by gunpowder; they were used by the Chinese, Indians, Mongols and Arabs, in warfare as early as the 13th century.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orbit]]al [[launch vehicle|launch systems]] are rockets and [[non-rocket spacelaunch|other systems]] capable of placing [[payload]]s into or [[escape trajectory|beyond]] [[Earth orbit]]. All current spacecraft use conventional chemical rockets ([[bipropellant rocket|bipropellant]] or [[solid rocket|solid-fuel]]) for launch, though some&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Such as the [[Pegasus rocket]] and [[SpaceShipOne]].&lt;/ref&gt; have used [[air-breathing engine]]s on their [[Multistage rocket|first stage]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Most satellites have simple reliable chemical thrusters (often [[monopropellant rocket]]s) or [[resistojet rocket]]s for [[orbital station-keeping]] and some use [[momentum wheel]]s for [[attitude control]]. Soviet bloc satellites have used [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]] for decades, and newer Western geo-orbiting spacecraft are starting to use them for north-south stationkeeping and orbit raising. Interplanetary vehicles mostly use chemical rockets as well, although a few have used [[ion thruster]]s and [[Hall effect thruster]]s (two different types of electric propulsion) to great success.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
&lt;references group="note"&gt;
&lt;ref name="N3"&gt;The Saturn V made 13 launches, 12 of which reached the correct orbits, and the other ([[Apollo 6]]) reached a different orbit than the one which had been planned; however, some mission objectives could still be completed; [http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/saturn_apollo/documents/Flight_History.pdf NASA, Saturn V News Reference, Appendix: Saturn V Flight History (1968)]. For more information, see the [[Saturn V]] article.  The Saturn V launch record is usually quoted as having never failed, e.g. ''"The rocket was masterminded by Wernher Von Braun and did not fail in any of its flights"'', Alan Lawrie and Robert Godwin; [http://www.apogeespacebooks.com/Books/Saturn.html Saturn], but the Apollo 6 launch should be considered a partial mission failure. The 13th launch of Saturn V was in special configuration (SA-513) with the [[Skylab]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="N4"&gt;The N1 rocket was initially designed for 75mt LEO capacity and launch attempts were made with this version, but there were studies to increase the payload capacity to 90—95 mt, if a liquid-hydrogen upper stage engine could be developed.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/references&gt;

The typical duration of a vinyl album is about 15 to 25 minutes per side. Classical music and spoken word recordings can extend to over 30 minutes on a side.  If a side exceeds the average time, the maximum groove amplitude is reduced to make room for the additional program material.  This can cause hiss in the sound from lower quality amplifiers when the volume is turned up to compensate for the lower recorded level.  An extreme example, [[Todd Rundgren]]'s  ''[[Initiation (Todd Rundgren album)|Initiation]]'' LP, with 36 minutes of music on one side, has a "technical note" at the bottom of the inner sleeve: "if the sound does not seem loud enough on your system, try re-recording the music onto tape." The total of around 40&amp;ndash;45 minutes often influences the arrangement of tracks, with the preferred positions being the opening and closing tracks of each side.

Although the term [[extended play|EP]] is commonly used to describe a 7" single with more than two tracks, technically they are not different from a normal 7" single. The EP uses reduced dynamic range and a smaller run-off groove area to extend the playing time. However, there are examples of singles, such as [[The Beatles]]' "[[Hey Jude]]" or [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]", which are six minutes long or more. (in 1989, RCA released 'Dreamtime' by the band [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love and Rockets]], which clocks at 8:40). These longer recordings would require the same technical approach as an EP. The term EP has also been used for 10" 45 rpm records, typically containing a reduced number of tracks.

Vinyl albums have a large 12" (30 cm) [[album cover]], which also allows cover designers scope for imaginative designs, often including fold-outs and leaflets.

'''DaVinci''' is a development tool used to create [[HTML5]] [[mobile app]]lications and media content. It includes a [[jQuery]] framework, which is a [[Javascript library|JavaScript library]], and can be used by developers and designers, to create web applications used on mobile devices, that have a [[user experience]] similar to native applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazine.nuefolio.com/2012/10/davinci-html5-development-tool-for-web-applications “Davinci – HTML5 Development Tool for Web Applications”], Nuefolio Magazine; USA, October 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Business applications, games, and [[rich media]] content, such as HTML5 multi-media magazines, advertisements, and animation, may be produced with the tool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itworld.co.kr/news/77333/%EC%9D%B8%ED%81%AC%EB%A1%9C%EC%8A%A4%2C+HTML5+%EC%9B%B9+%EC%95%B1+%EA%B0%9C%EB%B0%9C+%EC%86%94%EB%A3%A8%EC%85%98+%E2%80%98%EB%8B%A4%EB%B9%88%EC%B9%98%E2%80%99+%EC%B6%9C%EC%8B%9C “Incross releases HTML5 web app development solution ‘DaVinci’”], IT World; South Korea, August 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; DaVinci is based on standard web technology, including HTML5, [[CSS3#CSS_3|CSS3]], and [[JavaScript]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=105&amp;oid=092&amp;aid=0002011365 “B2C app saturation...the mobile B2B market opens up”], Naver News; South Korea, October 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
DaVinci is composed of DaVinci Studio and DaVinci Animator, which handle application programming and [[User interface|UI]] design, respectively. The tool has a [[WYSIWYG]] (What You See Is What You Get) authoring environment in which users may [[drag and drop]] components to build applications and design web content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designfloat.com/blog/2013/03/28/html5-frameworks-mobile-app-development “HTML5 and its Frameworks for Mobile App Development”], Design Float; USA, March 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Open source libraries, such as [[Knockout (web framework)|KnockOut]], jsView/jsRender, Impress.js, and turn.js are included in the tool. Other open source frameworks may also be integrated.

The Model View Controller (MVC) and Data Binding in JavaScript may be handled through DaVinci’s Data-Set Editor. Here, view components and model data may be visually bound, which allows users to create web applications with server integrated UI components without coding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davincisdk.com “DaVinci SDK”], DaVinci SDK Official Site; South Korea, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

DaVinci also includes a N-Screen editor, which automatically applies designs and functions to the screen size of various devices, such as [[smartphone]]s, [[Tablet computer|tablet PCs]], and [[smartTV]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etnews.com/news/contents/internet/2657259_1488.html “Jaewon Lee marches into the global market with web app authoring software”], ET News; South Korea, October 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==DaVinci and jQuery==
DaVinci has worked closely with the jQuery Foundation in presenting the very first jQuery conference in an Asian district on November 12, 2012 in Seoul, South Korea. DaVinci had been used as a tool to demonstrate application development techniques at the conference.&lt;ref&gt;Yi, Ji Young.

'''Differential technological development''' is a strategy proposed by [[transhumanist]] philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] in which societies would seek to influence the sequence in which [[emerging technologies]] developed. On this approach, societies would strive to retard the development of harmful technologies and their applications, while accelerating the development of beneficial technologies, especially those that offer protection against the harmful ones.{{which|date=October 2016}}&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2002"&gt;{{cite journal

[[Paul Christiano]] believes that while accelerating technological progress appears to be one of the best ways to improve human welfare in the next few decades, a faster rate of growth cannot be equally important for the far future because growth must eventually saturate due to physical limits. Hence, from the perspective of the far future, differential technological development appears more crucial.&lt;ref name=Christiano2014&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christiano|first1=Paul|title=On Progress and Prosperity|url=http://effective-altruism.com/ea/9f/on_progress_and_prosperity/|website=Effective Altruism Forum|accessdate=21 October 2014|date=15 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable?|blog post on forum|date=July 2016}}

Inspired by Bostrom's proposal, [[Luke Muehlhauser]] and Anna Salamon suggested a more general project of "differential intellectual progress", in which society advances its wisdom, philosophical sophistication, and understanding of risks faster than its technological power.&lt;ref name=Muehlhauser2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muehlhauser|first=Luke|author2=Anna Salamon|title=Intelligence Explosion: Evidence and Import|date=2012|pages=18–19|url=http://intelligence.org/files/IE-EI.pdf|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable?|self-published paper|date=July 2016}}&lt;ref name=Muehlhauser2013&gt;{{cite book|last=Muehlhauser|first=Luke|title=Facing the Intelligence Explosion|date=2013|publisher=Machine Intelligence Research Institute|url=http://intelligenceexplosion.com/2012/ai-the-problem-with-solutions/|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable?|self-published paper|date=July 2016}} Brian Tomasik has expanded on this notion.&lt;ref name=Tomasik2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomasik|first1=Brian|title=Differential Intellectual Progress as a Positive-Sum Project|url=http://foundational-research.org/differential-intellectual-progress-as-a-positive-sum-project/|website=Foundational Research Institute|accessdate=18 February 2016|date=23 Oct 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable?|self-published paper|date=July 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5291">'''Diffusion''' is the process by which a new [[idea]] or new [[product (business)|product]] is accepted by the [[Market (economics)|market]]. The '''rate of diffusion''' is the speed with which the new idea spreads from one [[consumer]] to the next. '''Adoption''' (the reciprocal process as viewed from a consumer perspective rather than distributor) is similar to diffusion except that it deals with the psychological processes an individual goes through, rather than an aggregate market process. In [[economics]] it is more often named "[[technological change]]".

==Theories==
There are several theories that purport to explain the mechanics of diffusion:
# '''[[Two-step flow of communication|The two-step hypothesis]]''' – information and acceptance flows, via the media, first to [[Opinion leadership|opinion leaders]], then to the general population
# The '''[[trickle-down effect]]''' – products tend to be expensive at first, and therefore only accessible to the wealthy social strata – in time they become less expensive and are diffused to lower and lower strata.
# '''The [[Everett Rogers]] [[Diffusion of innovations]] theory''' – for any given product category, there are five categories of product adopters:
#*'''[[Innovator]]s''' – venturesome, educated, multiple info sources;
#*'''[[Early adopter]]s''' – social leaders, popular, educated;
#*'''Early majority''' – deliberate, many informal social contacts;
#*'''Late majority''' – skeptical, traditional, lower socio-economic status;
#*'''Laggards''' – neighbours and friends are main info sources, fear of debt.
# '''[[Crossing the Chasm]]''' model developed by [[Geoffrey Moore]] – This model overlays the Everett Rogers' adoption curve with a 'chasm'. According to Moore, the marketer should focus on one group of customers at a time, using each group as a base for marketing to the next group. The most difficult step is making the transition between visionaries (early adopters) and pragmatists (early majority). This is the chasm that he refers to. Technologies or products that cannot cross this chasm will die or remain niche. If successful, a firm can create a bandwagon effect in which the momentum builds and the product becomes ubiquitous.
#'''[[technology acceptance model|Technology driven models]]''' – These are particularly relevant to software diffusion. The rate of acceptance of technology is determined by factors such as ease of use and usefulness.

==Rate==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Diffusionadoption.jpg|right|thumb|260px|The [[Diffusion of innovation|diffusion curves]] of many household innovations, from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 1998]] --&gt;

According to Everett M. Rogers, the rate of diffusion is influenced by:
* The product's perceived advantage or benefit.
* Riskiness of purchase.
* Ease of product use – complexity of the product.
* Immediacy of benefits.
* Observability.
* Trialability.
* Price.
* Extent of behavioural changes required.
* Return on investment in the case of industrial products.

===Models===
There are several types of diffusion rate models:
#'''Penetration models''' – use test market data to develop acceptance equations of expected sales volume as a function of time. Three examples of penetration models are:
#*Bass trial only model
#*Bass declining trial model
#*Fourt and Woodlock model
#'''Trial/Repeat models''' – number of repeat buyers is a function of the number of trial buyers.
#'''Deterministic models''' – assess number of buyers at various states of acceptance – later states are determined from calculations to previous states.
#'''Stochastic models''' – recognize that many elements of the diffusion process are unknown but explicitly incorporate probabilistic terms.

'''Doom9''' is a [[website]] featuring information on digital [[digital audio|audio]] and [[digital video|video]] manipulation (mostly video) and digital copyrights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ganesh|first1=TS|title=Intel's Ivy Bridge: A HTPC Perspective|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/5773/intels-ivy-bridge-an-htpc-perspective|accessdate=22 November 2017|publisher=Anandtech|date=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the [[internet forum|forum]] [[screen name (computing)|username]] of the author of the page, an [[Austria]]n who was a college student at the time of the creation of the site. The site's [[tagline]] is "The Definitive DVD Backup Resource".

Started in March 2000, the site has expanded to contain a wide range of information on the subject of digital video encoding and [[DVD]] backup (or [[ripping]]).&lt;ref name='coded'&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woodward|first1=Matt|title=7 codec round-up at Doom9|url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2003/05/305-2/|accessdate=22 November 2017|publisher=Ars Technica|date=5 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cat and Mouse Copy Protection|journal=Maximum PC|date=May 2007|pages=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PQIAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=doom9&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NM_Y9DeZER&amp;sig=n9rV_ZzrH-0M-28UYbm0xQlLiTY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYqbnQpdPXAhVK0oMKHTtRAwA4HhDoAQgyMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=doom9&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular sections of the site were the guides to DVD ripping and the annual codec comparisons, where popular digital video [[codec]]s were compared on the basis of quality, speed, and compression.&lt;ref name='coded' /&gt; The forum is frequented by many developers of the tools and codecs featured on the site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirk|first1=Jeremy|title=Hacker strips DRM from streaming Netflix movies|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1059410/netflix.html|accessdate=22 November 2017|publisher=MacWorld|date=9 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Windows Media DRM#Removal|FairUse4WM]]. The site has been criticized, as the techniques described by it can be used for [[copyright infringement]], but it maintains that its guides should only be used for [[fair use]]. In some cases, users suspected of illegally copying media are refused help on the forums.{{Cn|date=October 2018}}

The [[VirtualDubMod]] project began after many modifications to [[VirtualDub]] were posted on the Doom9 forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buechler|first1=Georgios Diamantopoulos, Sohail Salehi, John|title=Learning VirtualDub the complete guide to capturing, processing, and encoding digital video|date=2005|publisher=Packt Pub.|location=Birmingham, UK|isbn=9781847190246|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=apiArMc8t9MC&amp;pg=PT42&amp;lpg=PT42&amp;dq=VirtualDubMod+project+doom9&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z59Ar4NtBA&amp;sig=B3qtl8OvCQhCaR7voUZ69bnCO44&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE_7mJptPXAhWJyoMKHV30AXQQ6AEIQjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=VirtualDubMod%20project%20doom9&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doom9 gained notoriety as a result of its involvement in the [[AACS encryption key controversy]]. The utility [[BackupHDDVD]] was first posted by a Doom9 poster using the alias ''muslix64''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McMillian|first1=Robert|title=Hacker: Blu-ray, HD DVD copy protection cracked|url=https://www.infoworld.com/article/2659617/security/hacker--blu-ray--hd-dvd-copy-protection-cracked.html|accessdate=22 November 2017|publisher=Info World|date=29 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest information on how to find title and volume keys was also first revealed on Doom9 forums, by other users. The key that set off the controversy was also first posted by a user using the name ''arnezami''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=REIMER|first1=Jeremy|title=Crack in Blu-ray, HD DVD encryption gets wider|url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2007/02/8837/|accessdate=22 November 2017|publisher=Ars Technica|date=13 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doom9 is also known for being the main discussion forum for many major video encoding tools, such as [[x264]], [[AviSynth]] and [[MeGUI]].

== Projects ==
Due to the concentration of forum members who have technical backgrounds, there have been various software projects developed and maintained by forum members. These include:
*[[Media Player Classic Home Cinema]], a lightweight media player using the [[DirectShow]] API
*[[ffdshow-tryouts]], a collection of free software codecs, most notably [[libavcodec]], provided as DirectShow filters

Doom9 members have also contributed significantly to various software projects, including:
*[[x264]], a free software H.264 video encoder
*[[VirtualDubMod]], a video capture and linear editing tool

{{cleanup|reason=This article is poorly written and contains contradictory information|date=June 2013}}
'''Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC)''' is  a particular form of contracting arrangement used in some industries where the EPC contractor is made responsible for all the activities from design, procurement, construction, commissioning and handover of the project to the end-user or owner. This form of contract is covered by the FIDIC Silver Book &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIDIC Silver Book|url=http://fidic.org/sites/default/files/hosie06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing the title words "'''EPC/Turnkey'''". Other abbreviations used for this type of contract are "'''LSTK'''" for "'''Lump Sum Turn Key'''", '''EPIC''' for '''Engineering, Procurement, Installation &amp; Commissioning''' and sometimes also '''EPCC''' which is short for '''Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Commissioning'''. Use of EPC is common e.g. by FIDIC and most [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf countries]]. Use of LSTK is common in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Use of EPCC is common in Qatar and some other countries e.g. by Qatar Petroleum. Therefore, an EPC, LSTK or EPCC are all same types of contracts a typical well-known example of which is the Silver Book of [[FIDIC]]. 
    
'''Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management (EPCM)''' is a special form of [[contracting]] arrangement. In an EPCM arrangement, the client selects a contractor who provides '''management services''' for the whole project on behalf of the client. The EPCM contractor coordinates all design, procurement and construction work and ensures that the whole project is completed as required and in time. The EPCM contractor may or may not undertake actual site work. 

The acronym EPCM is also encountered frequently on international projects, but this is very different from EPC. EPCM is a services-only contract, under which the contractor performs engineering, procurement and construction management services.

'''Entertainment technology''' is the discipline of using manufactured or created components to enhance or make possible any sort of [[entertainment]] experience.  Because entertainment categories are so broad, and because entertainment models the world in many ways, the types of implemented technology are derived from a variety of sources.  Thus, in theatre, for example, entertainment technology practitioners must be able to design and construct [[scenery]], install electrical systems, build clothing, use motors if there is [[scenery automation]],{{clarify|date=January 2018}} provide plumbing (if functioning kitchen fixtures are required, or if "singing in the rain"), etc. In this way, the entertainment technology field intersects with most other types of technology.

Traditionally, entertainment technology is derived from theatrical [[stagecraft]], and stagecraft is an important subset of the discipline. However, the rise of new types and venues for entertainment, as well as rapidly advancing technological development, has increased the range and scope of its practice.

Entertainment technology includes:

*[[Scenery]] [[Manufacturing|fabrication]]
*[[Theatrical property|Properties]]
*[[Costume]]
*[[Lighting]]
*[[Sound]]
*[[Video]]
*[[Show control]]
*[[Automation]]
*[[Animatronics]]
*Interactive environments
*[[Computer simulation]]

In animation and game design, the phrase "entertainment technology" refers to a very real world of [[entertainment]] experiences made possible by the advent of primarily computer-mediated digital technologies.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

== History ==
Entertainment Technology can be traced back to the “Pre-digital Age.” The invention of the first phonograph machine, which is used to record and playback sound, dates back to 1877 by inventor Thomas Edison. There has been a significant progression from that antiquated modality of entertainment. From silent films (which also gave way to the art of creative storytelling using moving pictures) to the digital age, in which we now see growth on a global scale and, relative to earlier inventions, an extremely fast pace. By comparison, from the invention of the phonograph machine in 1877 to the invention of the first motion picture camera by Louis Lumiere in 1895 shows a gap of 18 years between significant entertainment technology inventions. Whereas compact discs were introduced in the 1980’s and within the next 10 years, satellite television was introduced. More recent developments in entertainment technology are sometimes considered to be a “race” in terms of which company will develop and distribute their product first. Knowing what we have available to us and where it all began can be used as a footnote in our ever-increasing development of entertainment and other technological advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6182692|title=IEEE Xplore Full-Text PDF:|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on Society ==
Society has completely been changed and advanced in many different ways by all the advancements in entertainment technology. Ranging from how companies get their product name out and get customers to buy into that product, to how people come into contact with one another and how we converse. Media and entertainment have become such a huge part of everyone’s life. We are all invested in some kind of media whether it is a tv show or a vlog and the producer of those are all very aware of the consumption of their product and will try to advertise it in as many ways as possible. They will reach out and promote their form of entertainment by having it on multiple platforms. Media companies will share their product on many different popular websites and forms of social media and ask its consumers to share it as well, generating more views and continuously advancing their products notoriety. Millions of dollars have been spent on Artificial Intelligence. Companies use AI because it is so detailed and precise with all of its obtained knowledge, they will use it to help market their brand because AI knows exactly what people like and what they want to see and will put together the final product that will succeed the most. Entertainment websites and websites that sell goods maintain and expand their viewers and customers by advertising something new you haven’t seen before when you are done with what you originally visited the website for. A big reason why a company became so successful and became so popular is that they bundled everything people want into a smaller collection, instead of having a much larger bundle that only included a couple items a consumer wants. Virtual reality is giving us a new way to experience the world. You can travel to see your favorite live event anywhere in the world without even having to leave your house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2017/04/25/top-six-digital-transformation-trends-in-media-and-entertainment/#311c80936729|title=Top Six Digital Transformation Trends In Media And Entertainment|last=Newman|first=Daniel|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-bringing-tv-life-digital-video-transformation-strategies|title=Digital Transformation in Media and Entertainment - Accenture|website=www.accenture.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples  ==

===== Virtual Reality =====
A three dimensional, computer generated simulation of a real seeming environment brought on by the use of special electronic equipment. This technology is used to replace the user’s entire real world environment with a computer generated (or simulated) one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.Overview.html|title=VIRTUAL REALITY - Overview|website=archive.ncsa.illinois.edu|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Augmented Reality   =====
An interactive technology that intertwines computer generated images with real world objects. These artificial images can align with or block the real world environment. This technology is used to alter the user’s perception of the real world which should not to be confused with virtual reality in which the user’s whole perception is changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macmillandictionary.com/buzzword/entries/augmented-reality.html|title=Augmented Reality - definition of Augmented Reality, Meaning of Augmented Reality, BuzzWord from Macmillan Dictionary.|website=www.macmillandictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== High Dynamic Range =====
A rich visual and audio experience that provides a greater contrast than standard dynamic range. This technology is most associated with display devices, sound recording, 3D rendering, and photography. Technology like this provides a more lifelike image in the visual aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/dynamic-range.htm|title=Understanding Dynamic Range in Digital Photography|website=www.cambridgeincolour.com|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Light Field Devices   =====
A device (usually a camera) that captures information about the light field that is emerging from a real life scene which is; the direction of the light rays in space and the intensity of the light in the actual environment/scene. This technology will someday surpass Virtual Reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117075834/http://www.time4.com/time4/microsites/popsci/howitworks/lightfield_camera.html|title=PopSci's How It Works - 100 Megapixel Camera|date=2008-01-17|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future Developments ==
Video streaming is becoming a huge part of society in this day and age and it’s only beginning to expand. Video streaming brought in a revenue of $30.29 billion in 2016 and based on projections conducted by Research and Markets, will reach an astonishing $70.05 billion in the year 2021. This projected drastic increase has caused there to be more competition in streaming, which has led to rapid growth, development, and a large increase in the amount of users. Technology is a data based driven field, and with this rapid growth the future is bright for this field. Technology has been enhancing discoveries for as long as it’s been invented. It holds the digital power to entertain, inform, and persuade. Technology will continue to provide all of these sentiments and will continue to do so for as long as developments keep forthcoming. Rapid growth and development does not only affect the consumers, but the producers. Large technology companies will have improve content quality of all while extracting maximum value of the product. Challenges for development in the media industry are how to maximize content, brands, and advertising. While also created tailoring consumers needs to enhance their experience. Consumers drive this field, companies are constantly running data about consumers preferences, relationships, habits, and locations. Technology is a growing field and with companies beginning to care more about the consumers, and with rapid growing development in this field, expect technology to take bigger steps forward in years to come.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/media-and-entertainment-industry-outlook-trends.html|title=2018 Media and Entertainment Industry Trends {{!}} Deloitte US|website=Deloitte United States|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-mission/technology-to-shape-the-future-of-media-entertainment-a1e3acd3b3ac|title=Technology to Shape the Future of Media &amp; Entertainment.|last=DataArt|date=2018-01-09|website=Medium|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Schools that offer programs or degrees in entertainment technology include:

* [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Entertainment Technology Center]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etc.cmu.edu/ Entertainment Technology Center].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[New York City College of Technology]], Department of Entertainment Technology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entertainmenttechnology.org/ Entertainment Technology], [[New York City College of Technology]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[University of Southern California]], Entertainment Technology Center&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinema.usc.edu/programs/entertainment-technology-center/ Entertainment Technology Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526035103/https://cinema.usc.edu/programs/entertainment-technology-center/ |date=2009-05-26 }}, [[University of Southern California]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tshwane University of Technology]], Pretoria, South Africa&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tut.ac.za/ Tshwane University of Technology], South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Entertainment Technology Training, New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toiwhakaari.ac.nz/study-at-toi-whakaari/entertainment-technology Entertainment Technology Training], New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently,{{when|date=January 2018}} the only university offering a degree specifically in Entertainment Engineering and Design (EED) is the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (UNLV).{{fact|date=January 2018}} Because UNLV's program is in its infancy, current entertainment technologists come from a wide variety of educational backgrounds, the most prevalent of which are theater and mechanical technology. Several other institutions of higher education offer similar programs for entertainment-related ventures.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

A bachelor's degree in these areas will typically have a difference of only a few specialized classes.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

Traditionally, people interested in careers in this field either presented themselves as apprentices within craft unions, or attended college programs in theatre technology. Although both are appropriate in limited ways, the growing world of entertainment technology encompasses many different types of performance and display environments than the theatre. To this end, newer opportunities have arisen that provide a wider educational base than these more traditional environments. An article "Rethinking Entertainment Technology Education" by John Huntington describes new teaching philosophies that resonate with the need for a richer and more flexible educational environment:&lt;ref name="huntington02"&gt;{{cite journal

{{quote|"We need to bridge the worlds of ivory-tower theatre education with the commercial world of live entertainment production. I believe this bridge would be beneficial not just to the technical students, but to the whole art of performance. When high-tech systems such as video, moving lights, computerized sound, mechanized scenery and show control are mastered by even average entertainment technicians, they can advance the state of their craft, which will allow artists to advance the state of their art."&lt;ref name="huntington02" /&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1931">'''Equivalent input''' (also '''input-referred''' or '''input-related'''), is a method of referring to the signal or noise level at the output of a system as if it were an input to the same system. This is accomplished by removing all signal changes (e.g. [[amplifier]] [[Gain (electronics)|gain]], [[transducer]] [[sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]], etc.) to get the units to match the input.&lt;ref name="IEC61000-4-3"&gt;[http://webstore.iec.ch/Webstore/webstore.nsf/Artnum_PK/39224 IEC61000-4-3], Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) - Part 4-3: Testing and measurement techniques - Radiated, radio-frequency, electromagnetic field immunity test&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aes.org/par/e/#ein|title=AES Pro Audio Reference - EIN|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aes.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
=== Equivalent Input Noise (EIN) ===
A [[microphone]] converts [[acoustical]] [[energy]] to [[electrical]] energy. Microphones have some level of electrical [[noise]] at their output. This noise may have contributions from random [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] movement, [[thermal noise]], or a dozen other sources, but those can all be thought of as an imaginary acoustic noise source injecting sound into the (now noiseless) microphone. The units on this noise are no longer [[volts]], but units of sound pressure ([[pascals]] or [[dBSPL]]), which can be directly compared to the desired sound pressure inputs.

=== Input-Related Interference Level (IRIL) ===
A device which uses a [[microphone]] may be susceptible to [[electromagnetic interference]] which causes [[sonic artifact]]s. The problem is not in the microphone, but the interference level can be ''related'' back to the input to compare to the level of typical inputs to see how [[Hearing|audible]] the artifact is.

The '''European Association for Technical Communication''' ('''tekom Europe [[Eingetragener Verein|e.V]].''') is the largest professional association for [[technical communication]] worldwide. The association connects more than 8,500 professionals like [[technical communicator]]s, [[technical writer]]s, and others from related fields. The working language is English.

tekom Europe was founded in November 2013 in Wiesbaden, Germany, by representatives of [http://www.tekom.de/ tekom Deutschland], of the former tekom country groups and of the Italian association [http://www.comtec-italia.org/ COM&amp;TEC].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technical-communication.org/press/tekom-europe-is-off-to-a-good-start.html tekom Europe, press release]&lt;/ref&gt; and registered as a lobby organization in the European Transparency Register.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=194995512904-93&amp;locale=en#en cf. European Transparency Register]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main task of the association is to organize creators of user information in their countries and represent their interests on European level. tekom Europe supports important EU policies such as improving the training of young people, the employability and mobility of workers as well as the competitiveness of the European economy in general. One of the European initiatives which tekom Europe is involved in is ESCO (European Skills/Competences, qualifications and Occupations).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1042&amp;langId=en cf.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1260">A '''gate in [[cytometry]]''' is a set of value limits (boundaries) that serve to isolate a specific group of [[Cytometry|cytometric]] events from a large set. Gates can be defined by discrimination analysis, or can simply be drawn around a given set of data points on a printout and then converted to a computer-useful form. Gates can be implemented with a physical blinder. Gates may be used either to selectively gather data or to segregate data for analysis.

==Division==
Gates are divided mathematically into inclusive gates and exclusive gates. Inclusive gates select data that falls within the limits set, while exclusive gates select data that falls outside the limits.

==Live gate==
A live gate is a term used for a process that prevents the acquisition by the computer of non-selected data from the [[flow cytometer]].

{{Redirect|Handoff}}

{{No footnotes|date=February 2008}}

In [[cellular network|cellular]] [[telecommunications]], the terms  '''handover''' or '''handoff''' refer to the process of transferring an ongoing call or data session from one channel connected to the [[core network]] to another channel. In [[satellite communications]] it is the process of transferring satellite control responsibility from one [[Earth station (communications)|earth station]] to another without loss or interruption of service.

==Terminology==
[[American English]]  uses the term ''handoff'', and this is most commonly used within some American organizations such as [[3GPP2]] and in American originated technologies such as [[CDMA2000]]. In [[British English]] the term ''handover'' is more common, and is used within international and European organisations such as [[ITU-T]], [[IETF]], [[ETSI]] and [[3GPP]], and standardised within European originated standards such as [[GSM]] and [[UMTS]]. The term handover is more common than handoff in academic research publications and literature, while handoff is slightly more common within the [[IEEE]] and [[ANSI]] organisations.{{or|date=November 2012}}

==Purpose==
In telecommunications there may be different reasons why a handover might be conducted:&lt;ref name=Miao&gt;[[Guowang Miao]], Jens Zander, Ki Won Sung, and Ben Slimane, Fundamentals of Mobile Data Networks, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|1107143217}}, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
* when the phone is moving away from the area covered by one cell and entering the area covered by another cell the call is transferred to the second cell in order to avoid call termination when the phone gets outside the range of the first cell;
* when the capacity for connecting new calls of a given cell is used up and an existing or new call from a phone, which is located in an area overlapped by another cell, is transferred to that cell in order to free-up some capacity in the first cell for other users, who can only be connected to that cell;
* in non-[[CDMA]] networks when the channel used by the phone becomes interfered by another phone using the same channel in a different cell, the call is transferred to a different channel in the same cell or to a different channel in another cell in order to avoid the interference;
* again in non-CDMA networks when the user behaviour changes, e.g. when a fast-travelling user, connected to a large, umbrella-type of cell, stops then the call may be transferred to a smaller macro cell or even to a micro cell in order to free capacity on the umbrella cell for other fast-traveling users and to reduce the potential interference to other cells or users (this works in reverse too, when a user is detected to be moving faster than a certain threshold, the call can be transferred to a larger umbrella-type of cell in order to minimize the frequency of the handovers due to this movement);
* in CDMA networks a handover (see further down) may be induced in order to reduce the interference to a smaller neighboring cell due to the "[[Near-far problem|near-far]]" effect even when the phone still has an excellent connection to its current cell;
* etc.

The most basic form of handover is when a [[cell phone|phone]] [[telephone call|call]] in progress is redirected from its current [[cell site|cell]] (called ''source'') to a new cell (called ''target'').&lt;ref name=Miao&gt;[[Guowang Miao]], Jens Zander, Ki Won Sung, and Ben Slimane, Fundamentals of Mobile Data Networks, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|1107143217}}, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In terrestrial networks the source and the target cells may be served from two different cell sites or from one and the same cell site (in the latter case the two cells are usually referred to as two ''sectors'' on that cell site). Such a handover, in which the source and the target are different cells (even if they are on the same cell site) is called ''inter-cell'' handover. The purpose of inter-cell handover is to maintain the call as the subscriber is moving out of the area covered by the source cell and entering the area of the target cell.

A special case is possible, in which the source and the target are one and the same cell and only the used channel is changed during the handover. Such a handover, in which the cell is not changed, is called ''intra-cell'' handover. The purpose of intra-cell handover is to change one channel, which may be interfered or fading with a new clearer or less fading channel.

==Types==
In addition to the above classification of ''inter-cell'' and ''intra-cell'' classification of handovers, they also can be divided into hard and soft handovers:&lt;ref name=Miao&gt;[[Guowang Miao]], Jens Zander, Ki Won Sung, and Ben Slimane, Fundamentals of Mobile Data Networks, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|1107143217}}, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
; Hard handover: Is one in which the channel in the source cell is released and only then the channel in the target cell is engaged. Thus the connection to the source is broken before or 'as' the connection to the target is made—for this reason such handovers are also known as ''break-before-make''. Hard handovers are intended to be instantaneous in order to minimize the disruption to the call. A hard handover is perceived by network engineers as an event during the call. It requires the least processing by the network providing service. When the mobile is between base stations, then the mobile can switch with any of the base stations, so the base stations bounce the link with the mobile back and forth. This is called 'ping-ponging'.
;[[Soft handover]]: Is one in which the channel in the source cell is retained and used for a while in parallel with the channel in the target cell. In this case the connection to the target is established before the connection to the source is broken, hence this handover is called ''make-before-break''. The interval, during which the two connections are used in parallel, may be brief or substantial. For this reason the soft handover is perceived by network engineers as a state of the call, rather than a brief event. Soft handovers may involve using connections to more than two cells:  connections to three, four or more cells can be maintained by one phone at the same time. When a call is in a state of soft handover, the signal of the best of all used channels can be used for the call at a given moment or all the signals can be combined to produce a clearer copy of the signal. The latter is more advantageous, and when such combining is performed both in the [[downlink]] ([[forward link]]) and the [[uplink]] ([[reverse link]]) the handover is termed as ''softer''. Softer handovers are possible when the cells involved in the handovers have a single cell site.
Handover can also be classified on the basis of handover techniques used. Broadly they can be classified into three types:
#Network controlled handover
#Mobile phone assisted handover
#Mobile controlled handover

==Comparison==
An advantage of the hard handover is that at any moment in time one call uses only one channel. The hard handover event is indeed very short and usually is not perceptible by the user. In the old [[analog transmission|analog]] systems it could be heard as a click or a very short beep; in digital systems it is unnoticeable. Another advantage of the hard handover is that the phone's hardware does not need to be capable of receiving two or more channels in parallel, which makes it cheaper and simpler. A disadvantage is that if a handover fails the call may be temporarily disrupted or even terminated abnormally. Technologies which use hard handovers, usually have procedures which can re-establish the connection to the source cell if the connection to the target cell cannot be made. However re-establishing this connection may not always be possible (in which case the call will be terminated) and even when possible the procedure may cause a temporary interruption to the call.

One advantage of the soft handovers is that the connection to the source cell is broken only when a reliable connection to the target cell has been established and therefore the chances that the call will be terminated abnormally due to failed handovers are lower. However, by far a bigger advantage comes from the mere fact that simultaneously channels in multiple cells are maintained and the call could only fail if all of the channels are interfered or fade at the same time. Fading and interference in different channels are unrelated and therefore the probability of them taking place at the same moment in all channels is very low. Thus the reliability of the connection becomes higher when the call is in a soft handover. Because in a cellular network the majority of the handovers occur in places of poor coverage, where calls would frequently become unreliable when their channel is interfered or fading, soft handovers bring a significant improvement to the reliability of the calls in these places by making the interference or the fading in a single channel not critical. This advantage comes at the cost of more complex hardware in the phone, which must be capable of processing several channels in parallel. Another price to pay for soft handovers is use of several channels in the network to support just a single call. This reduces the number of remaining free channels and thus reduces the capacity of the network. By adjusting the duration of soft handovers and the size of the areas in which they occur, the network engineers can balance the benefit of extra call reliability against the price of reduced capacity.

==Possibility==
While theoretically speaking soft handovers are possible in any technology, analog or digital, the cost of implementing them for analog technologies is prohibitively high and none of the technologies that were commercially successful in the past (e.g. [[Advanced Mobile Phone System|AMPS]], [[TACS]], [[Nordic Mobile Telephone|NMT]], etc.) had this feature. Of the digital technologies, those based on [[FDMA]] also face a higher cost for the phones (due to the need to have multiple parallel radio-frequency modules) and those based on [[Time division multiple access|TDMA]] or a combination of TDMA/FDMA, in principle, allow not so expensive implementation of soft handovers. However, none of the [[2G]] (second-generation) technologies have this feature (e.g. GSM, [[D-AMPS]]/[[IS-136]], etc.). On the other hand, all CDMA based technologies, 2G and [[3G]] (third-generation), have soft handovers. On one hand, this is facilitated by the possibility to design not so expensive phone hardware supporting soft handovers for CDMA and on the other hand, this is necessitated by the fact that without soft handovers CDMA networks may suffer from substantial interference arising due to the so-called ''[[Near-far problem|near-far]]'' effect..

In all current commercial technologies based on FDMA or on a combination of TDMA/FDMA (e.g. GSM, AMPS, IS-136/DAMPS, etc.) changing the channel during a hard handover is realised by changing the pair of used transmit/receive [[frequency|frequencies]].

==Implementations==
For the practical realisation of handovers in a cellular network each cell is assigned a list of potential target cells, which can be used for handing over calls from this source cell to them. These potential target cells are called ''neighbors'' and the list is called ''neighbor list''. Creating such a list for a given cell is not trivial and specialized computer tools are used. They implement different algorithms and may use for input data from field measurements or computer predictions of radio wave propagation in the areas covered by the cells.

During a call one or more parameters of the signal in the channel in the source cell are monitored and assessed in order to decide when a handover may be necessary. The downlink (forward link) and/or uplink (reverse link) directions may be monitored. The handover may be requested by the phone or by the [[Base transceiver station|base station]] (BTS) of its source cell and, in some systems, by a BTS of a neighboring cell. The phone and the BTSes of the neighboring cells monitor each other's signals and the best target candidates are selected among the neighboring cells. In some systems, mainly based on CDMA, a target candidate may be selected among the cells which are not in the neighbor list. This is done in an effort to reduce the probability of interference due to the aforementioned near-far effect.

In analog systems the parameters used as criteria for requesting a hard handover are usually the ''received [[signal power]]'' and the ''received [[signal-to-noise ratio]]'' (the latter may be estimated in an analog system by inserting additional tones, with frequencies just outside the captured voice-frequency band at the transmitter and assessing the form of these tones at the receiver). In non-CDMA 2G digital systems the criteria for requesting hard handover may be based on estimates of the received signal power, [[bit error rate]] (BER) and [[Block Error Rate|block error/erasure rate]] (BLER), received quality of speech ([[RxQual]]), distance between the phone and the BTS (estimated from the radio signal propagation delay) and others. In CDMA systems, 2G and 3G, the most common criterion for requesting a handover is [[Ec/Io]] ratio measured in the [[pilot channel]] ([[CPICH]]) and/or [[RSCP]].

In CDMA systems, when the phone in soft or softer handover is connected to several cells simultaneously, it processes the received in parallel signals using a [[rake receiver]]. Each signal is processed by a module called ''rake finger''. A usual design of a rake receiver in mobile phones includes three or more rake fingers used in soft handover state for processing signals from as many cells and one additional finger used to search for signals from other cells. The set of cells, whose signals are used during a soft handover, is referred to as the ''active set''. If the search finger finds a sufficiently-strong signal (in terms of high Ec/Io or RSCP) from a new cell this cell is added to the active set. The cells in the neighbour list (called in CDMA ''neighbouring set'') are checked more frequently than the rest and thus a handover with a neighbouring cell is more likely, however a handover with others cells outside the neighbor list is also allowed (unlike in GSM, IS-136/DAMPS, AMPS, NMT, etc.).

== Reasons for failure ==
There are occurrences where a handoff is unsuccessful. Much research has been dedicated to this problem.{{such as|date=June 2018}} The source of the problem was discovered in the late 1980s.  Because frequencies cannot be reused in adjacent cells, when a user moves from one cell to another, a new frequency must be allocated for the call. If a user moves into a cell when all available channels are in use, the user’s call must be terminated. Also, there is the problem of signal interference where adjacent cells overpower each other resulting in receiver desensitization.

==Vertical handover==
{{Main|Vertical handover}}

There are also inter-technology handovers where a call's connection is transferred from one access technology to another, e.g. a call being transferred from GSM to UMTS or from CDMA [[IS-95]] to [[cdma2000]].

The 3GPP [[Generic access network|UMA/GAN]] standard enables GSM/UMTS handoff to Wi-Fi and vice versa.

==Handoff Prioritization==
Different systems have different methods for handling and managing handoff request. Some systems handle handoff in same way as they handle new originating call. In such system the probability that the handoff will not be served is equal to blocking probability of new originating call. But if the call is terminated abruptly in the middle of conversation then it is more annoying than the new originating call being blocked. So in order to avoid this abrupt termination of ongoing call handoff request should be given priority to new call this is called as handoff prioritization.

There are two techniques for this:
;Guard Channel Concept: In this technique, a fraction of the total available channels in a cell is reserved exclusively for handoff request from ongoing calls which may be handed off into the cell.
;Queuing: Queuing of handoffs is possible because there is a finite time interval between the time the received signal level drops below handoff threshold and the time the call is terminated due to insufficient signal level. The delay size is determined from the traffic pattern of a particular service area.

==Inter and Intra System Handoff==
;Inter System Handoff:
*If during ongoing call mobile unit moves from one cellular system to a different cellular system which is controlled by different MTSO, a handoff procedure which is used to avoid dropping of call is referred as Inter System Handoff.
*An MTSO engages in this handoff system. When a mobile signal becomes weak in a given cell and MTSO can not find other cell within its system to which it can transfer the call then it uses Inter system handoff.
*Before implementation of Inter System Handoff MTSO compatibility must be checked and in Inter System Handoff local call may become long distance call.

;Intra System Handoff:
*If during ongoing call mobile unit moves from one cellular system to adjacent cellular system which is controlled by same  MTSO, a handoff procedure which is used to avoid dropping of call is referred as Intra System Handoff.
*An MTSO engages in this handoff system. When a mobile signal becomes weak in a given cell and MTSO finds other cell within its system to which it can transfer the call then it uses Intra system handoff.
*In Intra System Handoff local calls always remain local call only since after handoff also the call is handled by same MTSO.

For thousands of years, devices have been used to measure and keep track of [[time]]. The current [[sexagesimal]] [[Numeral system|system]] of time [[systems of measurement|measurement]] dates to approximately 2000&amp;nbsp;[[Anno Domini|{{sc|bc}}]]&lt;!--See talk page--&gt; from the  [[Sumer]]ians.

The  Egyptians divided the day into two 12-hour periods, and used large [[obelisk]]s to track the movement of the [[sun]]. They also developed [[water clock]]s, which were probably first used in the [[Precinct of Amun-Re]], and later outside Egypt as well; they were employed frequently by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], who called them ''clepsydrae''. The [[Zhou dynasty]] is believed to have used the outflow water clock around the same time, devices which were introduced from [[Mesopotamia]] as early as 2000{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}.

Other ancient timekeeping devices include the [[candle clock]], used in [[ancient China]], [[ancient Japan]], [[England]] and Mesopotamia; the [[Sundial#Shepherd dials – Timesticks|timestick]], widely used in [[India]] and [[Tibet]], as well as some parts of [[Europe]]; and the [[hourglass]], which functioned similarly to a water clock.  The [[sundial]], another early clock, relies on shadows to provide a good estimate of the hour on a sunny day.  It is not so useful in cloudy weather or at night and requires recalibration as the seasons change (if the [[gnomon]] was not aligned with the [[Earth's axis]]).

The earliest known clock with a [[water-power]]ed [[escapement]] mechanism, which transferred [[rotational energy]] into intermittent motions,&lt;ref name="Samual l. Jackson 18f."&gt;David Landes: "Revolution in Time: Clocks and the Making of the Modern World", rev. and enlarged edition, Harvard University Press, Cambridge 2000, {{ISBN|0-674-00282-2}}, p.18f.&lt;/ref&gt; dates back to 3rd century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} in [[ancient Greece]];&lt;ref name="Lewis 2000 356f"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2000|pp=343–369 (356f.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Science and technology in China|Chinese engineers]] later invented clocks incorporating [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]-powered escapement mechanisms in the 10th century,&lt;ref name="needham 411"/&gt; followed by [[Inventions in medieval Islam|Iranian engineers]] inventing water clocks driven by [[gear]]s and [[Maintaining power|weights]] in the 11th century.&lt;ref name=Hassan/&gt;

The first [[mechanical clock]]s, employing the [[verge escapement]] mechanism with a [[Balance wheel|foliot]] or [[balance wheel]] timekeeper, were invented in Europe at around the start of the 14th century, and became the standard timekeeping device until the [[pendulum clock]] was invented in 1656.  The invention of the [[mainspring]] in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first [[pocketwatch]]es by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the [[balance spring]] was added to the balance wheel in the mid 17th century.

The pendulum clock remained the most accurate timekeeper until the 1930s, when [[quartz oscillator]]s were invented, followed by [[atomic clock]]s after World War 2. Although initially limited to laboratories, the development of [[microelectronics]] in the 1960s made [[quartz clock]]s both compact and cheap to produce, and by the 1980s they became the world's dominant timekeeping technology in both clocks and [[wristwatch]]es.

Atomic clocks are far more accurate than any previous timekeeping device, and are used to calibrate other clocks and to calculate the [[International Atomic Time]]; a [[standardized]] civil system, [[Coordinated Universal Time]], is based on atomic time.

The oldest known sundial is from [[Ancient Egyptian|Egypt]]; it dates back to around 1500{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} (19th Dynasty), and was discovered in the Valley of the Kings in 2013.&lt;ref name="One of world's oldest sundials dug up in Kings' Valley, Upper Egypt"&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/03/130314085052.htm One of world's oldest sundials dug up in Kings' Valley, Upper Egypt]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sundials]] have their origin in [[shadow clock]]s, which were the first devices used for measuring the parts of a day.&lt;ref&gt;Major, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Egyptian obelisks, constructed about 3500{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, are also among the earliest shadow clocks.&lt;ref name=bruton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/573826/sundial |title=Sundial |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=4 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clockhistory&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bruton |first=Eric |title=The History of Clocks and Watches |publisher=Crescent Books |place=New York |isbn=0-517-37744-6 |year=1979 |edition=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Louxor obelisk Paris dsc00780.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Luxor Obelisk]] in [[Place de la Concorde]], [[Paris, France]]]]

Egyptian shadow clocks divided [[Daytime (astronomy)|daytime]] into 12 parts with each part further divided into more precise parts.&lt;ref name="One of world's oldest sundials dug up in Kings' Valley, Upper Egypt"/&gt; One type of shadow clock consisted of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which cast a shadow over those marks. It was positioned eastward in the morning, and was turned west at noon.&lt;!--Why?--&gt; Obelisks functioned in much the same manner: the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time. The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon, as well as the [[summer solstice|summer]] and [[winter solstice|winter]] [[solstice]]s.&lt;ref name=bruton/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/early.html |title=Earliest Clocks |work=A Walk Through Time |accessdate=2 April 2008 |publisher=NIST Physics Laboratory| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080315060613/http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/early.html| archivedate=March 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third shadow clock, developed c. 1500{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, was similar in shape to a bent [[T-square]]. It measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The ''T'' was oriented eastward in the mornings, and turned around at [[noon]], so that it could cast its shadow in the opposite direction.&lt;ref name=barnett&gt;Barnett, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Although accurate, shadow clocks relied on the sun, and so were useless at night and in cloudy weather.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Library of Congress"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/hourglass.html |title= How does an hourglass measure time? |accessdate=31 March 2008|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptians therefore developed a number of alternative timekeeping instruments, including water clocks, and a system for tracking star movements. The oldest description of a water clock is from the tomb inscription of the 16th-century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} Egyptian court official Amenemhet, identifying him as its inventor.&lt;ref&gt;Berlev, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; There were several types of water clocks, some more elaborate than others. One type consisted of a bowl with small holes in its bottom, which was floated on water and allowed to fill at a near-constant rate; markings on the side of the bowl indicated elapsed time, as the surface of the water reached them. The oldest-known waterclock was found in the tomb of [[pharaoh]] [[Amenhotep I]] (1525–1504{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}), suggesting that they were first used in ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name="NIST"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philbin, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell, pp. 59–61&lt;/ref&gt; Another Egyptian method of determining the time during the night was using [[Plumb-bob|plumb-lines]] called [[merkhet]]s. In use since at least 600{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, two of these instruments were aligned with [[Polaris]], the north [[pole star]], to create a north–south [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]. The time was accurately measured by observing certain stars as they crossed the line created with the ''merkhets''.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Time in History"&gt;Whitrow, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Water clock]]s, or clepsydrae, were commonly used in [[Ancient Greece]] following their introduction by [[Plato]], who also invented a water-based [[alarm clock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connor |first=J. J. |author2=Robertson, E.

The vat held a steadily increasing amount of water, supplied by a cistern. By morning, the vessel would have floated high enough to tip over, causing the lead balls to cascade onto a copper platter. The resultant clangor would then awaken Plato's students at the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility is that it comprised two jars, connected by a [[siphon]]. Water emptied until it reached the siphon, which transported the water to the other jar. There, the rising water would force air through a whistle, sounding an alarm.&lt;ref name=answers.com /&gt; The Greeks and [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldeans]] regularly maintained timekeeping records as an essential part of their astronomical observations.

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] astronomer, [[Andronicus of Cyrrhus]], supervised the construction of the [[Tower of the Winds]] in Athens in the 1st century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}.
[[File:Aerides Athens 2.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Tower of the Winds]] in [[Athens]], Greece, a 1st-century-BC [[clocktower]] from the period of [[Roman Greece]]]]
In Greek tradition, clepsydrae were used in [[court]]; later, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] adopted this practice, as well. There are several mentions of this in historical records and literature of the era; for example, in ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', [[Plato]] says that "Those men, on the other hand, always speak in haste, for the flowing water urges them on".&lt;ref name="Water clocks in court"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H8YOAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Greek and Roman Technology: A Sourcebook|last=Humphrey|first=John William|year=1998|publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages=518–519|accessdate=11 April 2008|isbn=0-415-06136-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another mention occurs in [[Lucius Apuleius]]' ''[[The Golden Ass]]'': "The Clerk of the Court began bawling again, this time summoning the chief witness for the prosecution to appear. Up stepped an old man, whom I did not know. He was invited to speak for as long as there was water in the clock; this was a hollow globe into which water was poured through a funnel in the neck, and from which it gradually escaped through fine perforations at the base".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Transformations of Lucius, Otherwise Known as The Golden Ass|last=Apuleius|first=Lucius|others=Translated by Robert Graves|publisher=[[Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux]]|location=[[New York, New York]]|year=1951|page=54|authorlink3=Apuleius|isbn=0-374-50532-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clock in Apuleius's account was one of several types of water clock used. Another consisted of a bowl with a hole in its centre, which was floated on water. Time was kept by observing how long the bowl took to fill with water.&lt;ref name="Waterclockhistory"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Rees, Abraham |title=Rees's clocks, watches, and chronometers (1819–20); a selection from the Cyclopaedia, or Universal dictionary of arts, sciences, and literature |publisher=C. E. Tuttle Co |location=Rutland, Vt |year=1970 |isbn=0-8048-0901-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although clepsydrae were more useful than sundials—they could be used indoors, during the night, and also when the sky was cloudy—they were not as accurate; the Greeks, therefore, sought a way to improve their water clocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-QcE2pBCLE8C&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Empires of Time: Calendars, Clocks, and Cultures|last=Aveni|first=Anthony F.|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|year=2000|isbn=1-86064-602-6|accessdate=22 June 2008|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although still not as accurate as sundials, Greek water clocks became more accurate around 325{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, and they were adapted to have a face with an hour hand, making the reading of the clock more precise and convenient. One of the more common problems in most types of clepsydrae was caused by [[water pressure]]: when the container holding the water was full, the increased pressure caused the water to flow more rapidly. This problem was addressed by Greek and Roman [[horology|horologists]] beginning in 100{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, and improvements continued to be made in the following centuries. To counteract the increased water flow, the clock's water containers—usually bowls or jugs—were given a conical shape; positioned with the wide end up, a greater amount of water had to flow out in order to drop the same distance as when the water was lower in the cone. Along with this improvement, clocks were constructed more elegantly in this period, with hours marked by gongs, doors opening to miniature figurines, bells, or moving mechanisms.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt; There were some remaining problems, however, which were never solved, such as the effect of temperature. Water flows more slowly when cold, or may even freeze.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Collier, James Lincoln |title=Clocks |publisher=Benchmark Books |location=[[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]], NY |year=2003 |page=25 |isbn=0-7614-1538-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 270{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} and {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}500, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] ([[Ctesibius]], [[Hero of Alexandria]], [[Archimedes]]) and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[horology|horologists]] and [[astronomer]]s began developing more elaborate mechanized water clocks. The added complexity was aimed at regulating the flow and at providing fancier displays of the passage of time. For example, some water clocks rang [[bell (instrument)|bells]] and [[gong]]s, while others opened doors and windows to show figurines of people, or moved pointers, and dials. Some even displayed [[astrology|astrological]] models of the universe.

Although the Greeks and Romans did much to advance water clock technology, they still continued to use shadow clocks. The mathematician and astronomer [[Theodosius of Bithynia]], for example, is said to have invented a universal sundial that was accurate anywhere on Earth, though little is known about it.&lt;ref name=oconnor&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connor |first=J.

[[Marcus Vitruvius Pollio]], the Roman author of ''[[De Architectura]]'', wrote on the mathematics of [[gnomon]]s, or sundial blades.&lt;ref name="thayer"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/9*.html#refK|title= Marcus Vitruvius Pollio: de Architectura, Book IX|accessdate= 7 September 2007|date= 7 July 2007|publisher= The Latin text is that of the Teubner edition of 1899 by Valentin Rose, transcribed by Bill Thayer}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of [[Augustus|Emperor Augustus]], the Romans constructed the largest sundial ever built, the [[Solarium Augusti]]. Its gnomon was an obelisk from [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buchner |first=Edmund |authorlink=Edmund Buchner|title=Solarium Augusti und [[Ara Pacis]] |journal=Römische Mitteilungen |volume=83 |language=German |location=Berlin |year=1976|issue=2|pages=319–375 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the obelisk from [[Campus Martius]] was used as the gnomon for Augustus's zodiacal sundial.&lt;ref name="story of time"&gt;{{Cite book|author=National Maritime Museum; Lippincott, Kristen; Eco, Umberto; Gombrich, E.

[[File:Ancient water clock used in qanat of gonabad 2500 years ago.JPG|thumb|Ancient Persian clock]]
[[File:میرآب.JPG|thumb|Reconstruction of the scene of a water clock manager (MirAab), Iran]]
According to [[Callisthenes]], the [[Persia]]ns were using [[water clock]]s in 328{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} to ensure a just and exact distribution of water from [[qanat]]s to their shareholders for agricultural irrigation. The use of water clocks in [[Iran]], especially in [[Zeebad]], dates back to 500{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. Later they were also used to determine the exact holy days of pre-Islamic religions, such as the ''[[Nowruz]]'', ''Chelah'', or ''[[Yaldā]]'' – the shortest, longest, and equal-length days and nights of the years. The water clocks used in Iran were one of the most practical ancient tools for timing the yearly calendar.&lt;ref name=Qanat&gt;[http://www.aftabir.com/articles/view/science_education/technical/c3c1183387267p1.php/%D9%82%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AB-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%87%D9%86%DA%AF%DB%8C-%D9%88-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86 Conference of Qanat in Iran – water clock in Persia 1383], in Persian&lt;/ref&gt;

Water clocks, or ''Fenjaan'', in Persia reached a level of accuracy comparable to today's standards of timekeeping. The fenjaan was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from a [[qanat]] or well for irrigation of the farms, until it was replaced by more accurate current clock.&lt;ref name=Qanat/&gt; Persian water clocks were a practical and useful tool for the qanat's shareholders to calculate the length of time they could divert water to their farm. The qanat was the only water source for agriculture and irrigation so a just and fair water distribution was very important. Therefore, a very fair and clever old person was elected to be the manager of the water clock, and at least two full-time managers were needed to control and observe the number of fenjaans and announce the exact time during the days and nights.&lt;ref name="Fenjaan"&gt;[http://amordadnews.com/neveshtehNamyesh.aspx?NId=6010 سايه‌ي شهرداري نجف‌آباد بر كهن‌ترين «ساعت آبي»‌ شهر] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429163019/http://amordadnews.com/neveshtehNamyesh.aspx?NId=6010 |date=April 29, 2014 }} Amordad News (in Persian)&lt;/ref&gt;

The fenjaan was a big pot full of water and a bowl with small hole in the center. When the bowl become full of water, it would sink into the pot, and the manager would empty the bowl and again put it on the top of the water in the pot. He would record the number of times the bowl sank by putting small stones into a jar.&lt;ref name="Fenjaan"/&gt;

The place where the clock was situated, and its managers, were collectively known as ''khaneh fenjaan''. Usually this would be the top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of sunset and sunrise. There was also another time-keeping tool named a ''staryab'' or [[astrolabe]], but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not practical for use as a farmers' calendar. The Zeebad Gonabad water clock was in use until 1965 when it was substituted by modern clocks.&lt;ref name=Qanat/&gt;

===Ancient and medieval China===

[[Joseph Needham]] speculated that the introduction of the outflow clepsydra to China, perhaps from [[Mesopotamia]], occurred as far back as the 2nd millennium{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, during the [[Shang Dynasty]], and at the latest by the 1st millennium{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. By the beginning of the [[Han Dynasty]], in 202{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, the outflow clepsydra was gradually replaced by the inflow clepsydra, which featured an indicator rod on a float. To compensate for the falling [[pressure head]] in the reservoir, which slowed timekeeping as the vessel filled, [[Zhang Heng]] added an extra tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel. Around 550 AD, Yin Gui was the first in China to write of the overflow or constant-level tank added to the series, which was later described in detail by the inventor [[Shen Kuo]]. Around 610, this design was trumped by two [[Sui Dynasty]] inventors, Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai, who were the first to create the balance clepsydra, with standard positions for the [[steelyard balance]].&lt;ref name=needham&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Joseph |last=Needham |authorlink=Joseph Needham|year=1986 |title=Science and Civilization in China |volume=4 |journal=Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2: Mechanical Engineering |location=Taipei |publisher=Caves Books, Ltd |pages=479–480 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Needham states that:
{{quote|text=...&amp;nbsp;[the balance clepsydra] permitted the seasonal adjustment of the pressure head in the compensating tank by having standard positions for the counterweight graduated on the beam, and hence it could control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night. With this arrangement no overflow tank was required, and the two attendants were warned when the clepsydra needed refilling.&lt;ref name=needham/&gt;}}

==Timekeeping innovations in medieval and pre-modern periods==
The term '[[clock]]' encompasses a wide spectrum of devices, ranging from [[wristwatch]]es to the [[Clock of the Long Now]]. The English word ''clock'' is said to derive from the [[Middle English]] ''clokke'', [[Old French|Old North French]] ''cloque'', or [[Middle Dutch]] ''clocke'', all of which mean ''[[Bell (instrument)|bell]]'', and are derived from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''clocca'', also meaning bell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=clock |title=Clock Etymology |accessdate=27 April 2008|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Clock|title=Merriam-Webster Online: Clock|accessdate=20 June 2008|work=[[Webster's Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/31/C0413100.html |accessdate=4 December 2007 |edition=Fourth |isbn=0-395-82517-2 |author=executive editor, Joseph P.

The clock continued to be improved, with the first [[pendulum clock]] being designed and built in the 17th century.

===Candle clocks===
{{Main|Candle clock}}
[[Image:Kerzenuhr.jpg|thumb|right|A [[candle clock]]]]
The earliest mention of [[candle clock]]s comes from a Chinese poem, written in {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}520 by You Jianfu. According to the poem, the graduated candle was a means of determining time at night. Similar candles were used in Japan until the early 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwmagazine.com/education_history.cfm |title=History of Time |accessdate=8 April 2008 |last=Flamer |first=Keith |year=2006|work=International Watch Magazine|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716162954/http://www.iwmagazine.com/education_history.cfm|archivedate=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The candle clock most commonly mentioned and written of is attributed to King [[Alfred the Great]]. It consisted of six candles made from 72&amp;nbsp;[[pennyweight]]s of wax, each {{convert|12|in|cm}} high, and of uniform thickness, marked every inch (2.54&amp;nbsp;cm). As these candles burned for about four hours, each mark represented 20&amp;nbsp;minutes. Once lit, the candles were placed in wooden framed glass boxes, to prevent the flame from extinguishing.&lt;ref name="alfred"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' |url=http://kids.britannica.com/clockworks/t_candle.html |title=Clockworks: Candle clock |accessdate=16 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126001057/http://kids.britannica.com/clockworks/t_candle.html |archivedate=November 26, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most sophisticated candle clocks of their time were those of [[Al-Jazari]] in 1206. One of his candle clocks included a [[Dial (measurement)|dial]] to display the time and, for the first time, employed a [[Bayonet mount|bayonet fitting]], a [[Fastener|fastening mechanism]] still used in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Discoveries, Episode 12: Machines of the East|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwGfw1YW9Js|accessdate=7 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Routledge Hill]] described Al-Jazari's candle clocks as follows:

{{quote|The candle, whose rate of burning was known, bore against the underside of the cap, and its wick passed through the hole. Wax collected in the indentation and could be removed periodically so that it did not interfere with steady burning. The bottom of the candle rested in a shallow dish that had a ring on its side connected through pulleys to a counterweight. As the candle burned away, the weight pushed it upward at a constant speed. The automata were operated from the dish at the bottom of the candle. No other candle clocks of this sophistication are known.&lt;ref name=Hill2/&gt;}}

[[Image:Oil-lamp clock00.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An [[oil-lamp clock]]]]

A variation on this theme were [[oil-lamp clock]]s. These early timekeeping devices consisted of a graduated glass reservoir to hold oil — usually whale oil, which burned cleanly and evenly — supplying the fuel for a built-in lamp. As the level in the reservoir dropped, it provided a rough measure of the passage of time.

===Incense clocks===
{{Main article|Incense clock}}
In addition to water, mechanical, and candle clocks, [[incense clock]]s were used in the [[Far East]], and were fashioned in several different forms.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; [[Incense]] clocks were first used in China around the 6th century; in Japan, one still exists in the [[Shōsōin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Eastern Magnificence and European Ingenuity: Clocks of Late Imperial China|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8bXxHSZkWssC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA209,M1|last=Pagani|first=Catherine|page=209|isbn=0-472-11208-2|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; although its characters are not Chinese, but [[Devanagari]].&lt;ref name="Schafer"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QerLX9x8pIkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA160,M1|title=The Golden Peaches of Samarkand: A Study of T'ang Exotics|pages=160–161|last=Schafer|first=Edward|year=1963|isbn=0-520-05462-8|publisher=[[University of California Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their frequent use of Devanagari characters, suggestive of their use in [[Buddhist]] ceremonies, [[Edward H. Schafer]] speculated that incense clocks were invented in [[India]].&lt;ref name="Schafer"/&gt; Although similar to the candle clock, incense clocks burned evenly and without a flame; therefore, they were more accurate and safer for indoor use.&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infolab.stanford.edu/~echang/Class/public/report.html |title=Visualizing Video Streams using Sand Glass Metaphor |author1=Chang, Edward |author2=Lu, Yung-Hsiang |publisher=Stanford University |date=December 1996|accessdate=20 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several types of incense clock have been found, the most common forms include the [[incense stick]] and incense seal.&lt;ref name="Burning rates"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XDwZ9WZ3oBIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA55,M1|title=Of Time, Passion, and Knowledge: Reflections on the Strategy of Existence|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|last=Fraser|first=Julius|pages=55–56|year=1990|isbn=0-691-02437-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=msi /&gt; An incense stick clock was an incense stick with calibrations;&lt;ref name=msi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msichicago.org/scrapbook/scrapbook_exhibits/time/educ_pages/act_incenseclock.html |title=Time Activity: Incense Clock |accessdate=29 April 2008 |publisher=Museum of Science and Industry |location=Chicago |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704105617/http://www.msichicago.org/scrapbook/scrapbook_exhibits/time/educ_pages/act_incenseclock.html |archivedate=July 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; most were elaborate, sometimes having threads, with weights attached, at even intervals. The weights would drop onto a platter or gong below, signifying that a certain amount of time had elapsed.

Incense seal clocks were used for similar occasions and events as the stick clock; while religious purposes were of primary importance,&lt;ref name="Burning rates"/&gt; these clocks were also popular at social gatherings, and were used by Chinese scholars and intellectuals.&lt;ref name="Bedini103"&gt;Bedini, pp. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt; The seal was a wooden or stone disk with one or more grooves etched in it&lt;ref name="Burning rates"/&gt; into which incense was placed.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; These clocks were common in China,&lt;ref name="Bedini103"/&gt; but were produced in fewer numbers in Japan.&lt;ref name="Bedini187"/&gt; To signal the passage of a specific amount of time, small pieces of fragrant woods, resins, or different scented incenses could be placed on the incense powder trails.

While early incense seals were made of wood or stone, the Chinese gradually introduced disks made of metal, most likely beginning during the [[Song dynasty]]. This allowed craftsmen to more easily create both large and small seals, as well as design and decorate them more aesthetically. Another advantage was the ability to vary the paths of the grooves, to allow for the changing length of the days in the year. As smaller seals became more readily available, the clocks grew in popularity among the Chinese, and were often given as gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Bedini, pp. 104–106&lt;/ref&gt; Incense seal clocks are often sought by modern-day clock collectors; however, few remain that have not already been purchased or been placed on display at museums or temples.&lt;ref name="Bedini187"&gt;Bedini, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sundials===
{{Main|Sundial}}
[[Image:SevillaGlorietaDelReloj01.JPG|thumb|A 20th-century [[sundial]] in [[Seville]], [[Andalusia]], Spain]]
Sundials had been used for timekeeping since [[Ancient Egypt]]. Ancient dials were nodus-based with straight hour-lines that indicated unequal hours—also called temporary hours—that varied with the seasons. Every day was divided into 12&amp;nbsp;equal segments regardless of the time of year; thus, hours were shorter in winter and longer in summer. The [[sundial]] was further developed by [[Islamic astronomy|Muslim astronomers]]. The idea of using hours of equal length throughout the year was the innovation of Abu'l-Hasan [[Ibn al-Shatir]] in 1371, based on earlier developments in [[trigonometry]] by [[Muhammad ibn Jābir al-Harrānī al-Battānī]] (Albategni). Ibn al-Shatir was aware that "using a [[gnomon]] that is parallel to the Earth's axis will produce sundials whose hour lines indicate equal hours on any day of the year". His sundial is the oldest polar-axis sundial still in existence. The concept appeared in Western sundials starting in 1446.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the sundial |url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.353 |publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]] |accessdate=2 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010044606/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.353 |archivedate=October 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Sundial And Geometry|first=Lawrence|last=Jones|journal=North American Sundial Society|volume=12|issue=4|date=December 2005|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the acceptance of [[heliocentrism]] and equal hours, as well as advances in trigonometry, sundials appeared in their present form during the [[Renaissance]], when they were built in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Mayall, Margaret W. |author2=Mayall, R.

===Hourglass===
{{Main|Hourglass}}
Since the [[hourglass]] was one of the few reliable methods of measuring time at sea, it is speculated that it was used on board ships as far back as the 11th century, when it would have complemented the magnetic compass as an aid to navigation. However, the earliest unambiguous evidence of their use appears in the painting ''Allegory of Good Government'', by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]], from 1338.&lt;ref&gt;Frugoni p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; From the 15th century onwards, hourglasses were used in a wide range of applications at sea, in churches, in industry, and in cooking; they were the first dependable, reusable, reasonably accurate, and easily constructed time-measurement devices. The hourglass also took on symbolic meanings, such as that of death, temperance, opportunity, and [[Father Time]], usually represented as a bearded, old man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Macey, Samuel L. |title=Encyclopedia of Time |publisher=Garland Pub |location=New York |year=1994 |isbn=0-8153-0615-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=F7wNQk219KMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA209,M1|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though also used in China, the [[hourglass]]'s history there is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Blaut|first=James Morris|title=Eight Eurocentric Historians|publisher=Guildford Press|year=2000|isbn=1-57230-591-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ktn7LmLgc6oC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA186,M1|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]] used 18 hourglasses on each ship during his circumnavigation of the globe in 1522.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bergreen, Laurence |title=Over the Edge of the World: Magellan's Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe |publisher=Morrow |location=New York |year=2003 |isbn=0-06-621173-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uK9d2EFrMJIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA53,M1|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clocks with gears and escapements===
The earliest instance of a liquid-driven escapement was described by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] engineer [[Philo of Byzantium]] (fl. 3rd century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}) in his technical treatise ''Pneumatics'' (chapter 31) where he likens the escapement mechanism of a [[washstand]] [[automaton]] with those as employed in (water) clocks.&lt;ref name="Lewis 2000 356f"/&gt; Another early clock to use [[escapement]]s was built during the 7th century in [[Chang'an]], by [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] monk and mathematician, [[Yi Xing]], and government official [[Liang Lingzan]].&lt;ref name="ASME"&gt;{{Cite book|last=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|title=Proceedings of the 2002 ASME Design Engineering Technical Conferences|year=2002|publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|isbn=0-7918-3624-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shafer"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Schafer | first = Edward H. | authorlink = Edward H.

[It] was made in the image of the round heavens and on it were shown the lunar mansions in their order, the equator and the degrees of the heavenly circumference. Water, flowing into scoops, turned a wheel automatically, rotating it one complete revolution in one day and night. Besides this, there were two rings fitted around the celestial sphere outside, having the sun and moon threaded on them, and these were made to move in circling orbit&amp;nbsp;... And they made a wooden casing the surface of which represented the horizon, since the instrument was half sunk in it. It permitted the exact determinations of the time of dawns and dusks, full and new moons, tarrying and hurrying. Moreover, there were two wooden jacks standing on the horizon surface, having one a bell and the other a drum in front of it, the bell being struck automatically to indicate the hours, and the drum being beaten automatically to indicate the quarters. All these motions were brought about by machinery within the casing, each depending on wheels and shafts, hooks, pins and interlocking rods, stopping devices and locks checking mutually.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000817/081712eo.pdf |title=The mechanical clock |work=[[UNESCO Courier]] |accessdate=16 April 2008 | date=October 1988|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Clock Tower from Su Song's Book desmear.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The original diagram of [[Su Song]]'s book showing the inner workings of his [[clock tower]]]]

Since Yi Xing's clock was a [[water clock]], it was affected by temperature variations. That problem was solved in 976 by [[Zhang Sixun]] by replacing the water with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which remains liquid down to {{convert|-39|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Zhang implemented the changes into his [[clock tower]], which was about {{convert|10|m}} tall, with escapements to keep the clock turning and bells to signal every quarter-hour. Another noteworthy clock, the elaborate Cosmic Engine, was built by [[Su Song]], in 1088. It was about the size of Zhang's tower, but had an automatically rotating [[armillary sphere]]—also called a celestial globe—from which the positions of the stars could be observed. It also featured five panels with [[mannequins]] ringing gongs or bells, and tablets showing the time of day, or other special times.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt; Furthermore, it featured the first known endless power-transmitting [[chain drive]] in horology.&lt;ref name="needham 411"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Joseph |last=Needham |authorlink=Joseph Needham|year=1986 |title=Science and Civilization in China |volume=4 |journal=Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2: Mechanical Engineering |location=Taipei |publisher=Caves Books, Ltd |page=411 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally built in the capital of [[Kaifeng]], it was dismantled by the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin army]] and sent to the capital of [[Fanyang|Yanjing]] (now [[Beijing]]), where they were unable to put it back together.

[[Clock tower]]s in [[Western Europe]] in the Middle Ages were also sometimes [[striking clock]]s. The most famous original still standing is possibly [[St Mark's Clock]] on the top of [[St Mark's Clocktower]] in [[St Mark's Square (Venice)|St Mark's Square]] in [[Venice]], assembled in 1493 by the clockmaker Gian Carlo Rainieri from [[Reggio Emilia]]. In 1497, Simone Campanato moulded the great bell on which every definite time-lapse is beaten by two mechanical bronze statues (h. 2,60 m.) called ''Due Mori'' (''Two [[Moors]]''), handling a hammer. Possibly earlier (1490) is the [[Prague Astronomical Clock]] by clockmaster Jan Růže (also called Hanuš) – according to another source this device was assembled as early as 1410 by clockmaker [[Mikuláš of Kadaň]] and mathematician [[Jan Šindel]]. The allegorical parade of animated sculptures rings on the hour every day.

A sophisticated water-powered astronomical clock was built by [[Al-Jazari]] in 1206. This [[castle clock]] was a complex device that was about {{convert|11|ft|m}} high, and had multiple functions alongside timekeeping. It included a display of the [[zodiac]] and the solar and lunar paths, and a pointer in the shape of the [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]] which travelled across the top of a gateway, moved by a hidden cart and causing doors to open, each revealing a [[mannequin]], every hour.&lt;ref name=Hill2&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill|Routledge Hill, Donald]], "Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East", ''[[Scientific American]]'', May 1991, pp. 64–9 ([[cf.]] [[Donald Routledge Hill]], [http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/HistoryofSciences.htm Mechanical Engineering]) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305162155/http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/HistoryofSciences.htm |date=March 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard R.

The religious necessities and technical skill of the medieval monks were crucial factors in the development of clocks, as the historian [[Thomas Woods]] writes:
{{quote|text=The monks also counted skillful clock-makers among them. The first recorded clock was built by the future [[Pope Sylvester II]] for the German town of [[Magdeburg]], around the year 996.

[[Salisbury cathedral clock]], dating from about 1386, is one of the oldest working clocks in the world, and may be the oldest.  It still has most of its original parts,&lt;ref name="Salisbury"&gt;{{cite web| title= Oldest Working Clock, Frequently Asked Questions, Salisbury Cathedral|url= http://www.salisburycathedral.org.uk/visitor.faqs.php?id=23|accessdate= 4 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; although its original [[verge and foliot]] timekeeping mechanism is lost, having been converted to a [[pendulum]], which was replaced by a replica verge in 1956.

The framework is held together with metal dowels and pegs.  Two large stones, hanging from pulleys, supply the power. As the weights fall, ropes unwind from the wooden barrels.

During the Middle Ages, clocks primarily served religious purposes; the first employed for secular timekeeping emerged around the 15th century.

====Wristwatch====
{{Main article|Wristwatch|history of watches}}
[[File:Leicester as Governor-General engraving by Goltzius.jpg|thumb|upright|right|One of the earliest references to a wristwatch – an 'arm watch' given to Queen [[Elizabeth I]] by her favourite [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]].]]
The concept of the wristwatch goes back to the production of the very earliest watches in the 16th century. [[Elizabeth I]] of England received a wristwatch from [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]] in 1571, described as an arm watch. From the beginning, wrist watches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocket-watches up until the early 20th century. This was not just a matter of fashion or prejudice; watches of the time were notoriously prone to fouling from exposure to the elements, and could only reliably be kept safe from harm if carried securely in the pocket. When the [[waistcoat]] was introduced as a manly fashion at the court of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in the 17th century, the pocket watch was tucked into its pocket. [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert]], the consort to [[Queen Victoria]], introduced the 'Albert chain' accessory, designed to secure the pocket watch to the man's outergarment by way of a clip. By the mid nineteenth century, most watchmakers produced a range of wristwatches, often marketed as [[bracelet]]s, for women.&lt;ref name="Evolu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagewatchstraps.com/wristwatches.html|title=THe Evolution of the Wristwatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wristwatches were first worn by military men towards the end of the nineteenth century, when the importance of synchronizing manoeuvres during war without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signalling was increasingly recognized. It was clear that using pocket watches while in the heat of battle or while mounted on a horse was impractical, so officers began to strap the watches to their wrist. The Garstin Company of [[London]] patented a 'Watch Wristlet' design in 1893, although they were probably producing similar designs from the 1880s. Clearly, a market for men's wristwatches was coming into being at the time. Officers in the [[British Army]] began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War|Anglo-Burma War]] of 1885.&lt;ref name="Evolu" /&gt;

During the [[Boer War]], the importance of coordinating troop movements and synchronizing attacks against the highly mobile Boer insurgents was paramount, and the use of wristwatches subsequently became widespread among the officer class. The company [[Mappin &amp; Webb]] began production of their successful 'campaign watch' for soldiers during the [[Battle of Omdurman|campaign at the Sudan in 1898]] and ramped up production for the Boer War a few years later.&lt;ref name="Evolu" /&gt;

[[File:First Battle of Passchendaele - barrage map (colour balance).jpg|thumb|right|Planning map for an Allied creeping barrage at [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]] – a tactic that required precise synchronisation between the artillery and infantry.]]
These early models were essentially standard pocket-watches fitted to a leather strap, but by the early 20th century, manufacturers began producing purpose-built wristwatches. The Swiss company, Dimier Frères &amp; Cie patented a wristwatch design with the now standard wire lugs in 1903. In 1904, [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]], an early aviator, asked his friend, a French [[watchmaker]] called [[Louis Cartier]], to design a watch that could be useful during his flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lego Mindstorms NXT Hacker's Guide|last=Prochnow|first=Dave|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2006|isbn=0-07-148147-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilsdorf was an early convert to the wristwatch, and contracted the Swiss firm Aegler to produce a line of wristwatches. His Rolex wristwatch of 1910 became the first such watch to receive certification as a chronometer in Switzerland and it went on to win an award in 1914 from [[Kew Observatory]] in [[Richmond, Surrey|Richmond]], west London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qualitytyme.net/pages/rolex_articles/history_of_wristwatch.html|title=The History and Evolution of the Wristwatch.|author=John E.

The impact of the [[First World War]] dramatically shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch, and opened up a mass market in the post-war era. The [[creeping barrage]] artillery tactic, developed during the War, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of [[trench warfare]], with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. Wristwatches were also found to be needed in the air as much as on the ground: military pilots found them more convenient than pocket watches for the same reasons as Santos-Dumont had. The British [[War Office|War Department]] began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Paul|title=Wings of Madness: Alberto Santos-Dumont and the Invention of Flight|publisher=Hyperion Press|year=2004|isbn=0-7868-8571-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company H. Williamson Ltd., based in [[Coventry]], was one of the first to capitalize on this opportunity. During the company's 1916 [[Annual general meeting|AGM]] it was noted that "...the public is buying the practical things of life. Nobody can truthfully contend that the watch is a luxury. It is said that one soldier in every four wears a wristlet watch, and the other three mean to get one as soon as they can." By the end of the War, almost all enlisted men wore a wristwatch, and after they were demobilized, the fashion soon caught on – the British ''[[British Horological Institute|Horological Journal]]'' wrote in 1917 that "...the wristlet watch was little used by the sterner sex before the war, but now is seen on the wrist of nearly every man in uniform and of many men in civilian attire." Within a decade, sales of wristwatches had outstripped those of pocket watches.&lt;ref name="Evolu" /&gt;

====Equation clock====
{{Main|Equation clock}}
In the late 17th and 18th Centuries, [[equation clock]]s were made, which allowed the user to see or calculate apparent [[solar time]], as would be shown by a [[sundial]]. Before the invention of the pendulum clock, sundials were the only accurate timepieces. When good clocks became available, they appeared inaccurate to people who were used to trusting sundials. The annual variation of the [[equation of time]] made a clock up to about 15 minutes fast or slow, relative to a sundial, depending on the time of year. Equation clocks satisfied the demand for clocks that always agreed with sundials. Several types of equation clock mechanism were devised. which can be seen in surviving examples, mostly in museums.

Astronomers in particular needed a better tool for timing the transit of stars and thereby creating more accurate maps of the heavens. The pendulum proved to be the key to boosting the accuracy and dependability of timekeepers. [[Galileo Galilei]], the Italian physicist and astronomer, and others before him experimented with pendulums, but a young Dutch astronomer and mathematician named Christiaan Huygens devised the first pendulum clock on Christmas Day in 1656. (...) Pendulum clocks were about 100 times as accurate as their predecessors, reducing a typical gain or loss of 15 minutes a day to about a minute a week. News of the invention spread rapidly, and by 1660 English and French artisans were developing their own versions of this new timekeeper. &lt;br/&gt; In 1675 Huygens devised his next major improvement, the spiral balance spring. (...) The spiral balance spring revolutionized the accuracy of watches, enabling them to keep time to within a minute a day.

Innovations to the mechanical clock continued, with miniaturization leading to domestic clocks in the 15th century, and personal watches in the 16th.&lt;ref name="Davies434"/&gt; In the 1580s, the Italian [[polymath]] [[Galileo Galilei]] investigated the regular swing of the [[pendulum]], and discovered that it could be used to regulate a clock.&lt;ref name=nistrevolution/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pockets"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Davies |first=Eryl |title=Pockets: Inventions |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |location=London |year=1995 |isbn=0-7513-5184-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Galileo studied the pendulum as early as 1582, he never actually constructed a clock based on that design.&lt;ref name=nistrevolution/&gt; The first pendulum clock was designed and built by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]], in 1656.&lt;ref name=nistrevolution/&gt; Early versions erred by less than one minute per day, and later ones only by 10&amp;nbsp;seconds, very accurate for their time.&lt;ref name=nistrevolution/&gt;

In [[England]], the manufacturing of pendulum clocks was soon taken up.&lt;ref name="histworld"/&gt; The [[longcase clock]] (also known as the [[grandfather clock]]) was first created to house the pendulum and works by the English clockmaker William Clement in 1670 or 1671; this became feasible after Clement invented the [[anchor escapement]] mechanism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa072801a.htm |title=The History of Mechanical Pendulum Clocks and Quartz Clocks |work=about.com |year=2012 |accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in about 1670.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Short History of Technology: From the Earliest Times to A.D. 1900|last=Derry|first=T.

To avoid the need for a very large case, most clocks using the verge escapement had a short pendulum. The anchor mechanism, however, reduced the pendulum's necessary swing to between 4° to 6°, allowing clockmakers to use longer pendulums with consequently slower beats. These required less power to move, caused less friction and wear, and were more accurate than their shorter predecessors. Most longcase clocks use a pendulum about a metre (39&amp;nbsp;inches) long to the center of the bob, with each swing taking one second. This requirement for height, along with the need for a long drop space for the weights that power the clock, gave rise to the tall, narrow case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brain|first=Marshall|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/clock.htm|title=How Pendulum Clocks Work|publisher=[[HowStuffWorks]] |accessdate=10 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clement also introduced the pendulum suspension spring in 1671. The concentric minute hand was added to the clock by [[Daniel Quare]], a London clock-maker, and the Second Hand was introduced.

The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were another major contributor to the development of pendulum clocks in the 17th and 18th centuries, having had an "unusually keen appreciation of the importance of precision".&lt;ref name="Woods100"&gt;Woods, pp. 100–101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woods103"&gt;Woods, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In measuring an accurate one-second pendulum, for example, the Italian astronomer Father [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] persuaded nine fellow Jesuits "to count nearly 87,000 oscillations in a single day".&lt;ref name="Woods103"/&gt; They served a crucial role in spreading and testing the scientific ideas of the period, and collaborated with contemporary scientists, such as Huygens.&lt;ref name="Woods100"/&gt;

Like pendulum clocks, [[balance spring|spiral-hairspring]] [[watch]]es were early precision timekeeping devices.]]

The invention of the [[mainspring]] in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first [[pocketwatch]]es by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the [[balance spring]] was added to the [[balance wheel]] in the mid 17th century. Some dispute remains as to whether British scientist [[Robert Hooke]] (his was a straight spring) or Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] was the actual inventor of the [[balance spring]]. Huygens was clearly the first to use a spiral balance spring, the form used in virtually all watches to the present day.  The addition of the balance spring made the balance wheel a [[harmonic oscillator]] like the pendulum in a pendulum clock, which oscillated at a fixed [[resonant frequency]] and resisted oscillating at other rates.  This innovation increased watches' accuracy enormously, reducing error from perhaps several hours per day to perhaps 10 minutes per day,&lt;ref name="nistrevolution"/&gt; resulting in the addition of the [[Clock face|minute hand]] to the watch face around 1680 in Britain and 1700 in France&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://atena.beic.it/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=13458392&amp;search_terms=DTL59|title=Acta Eruditorum|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1737|isbn=|location=Leipzig|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Like the invention of [[pendulum clock]], Huygens' spiral [[hairspring]] ([[balance spring]]) system of portable timekeepers, helped lay the foundations for the modern [[watchmaking]] industry.

In 1675, Huygens and [[Robert Hooke]] invented the [[spiral balance]], or the hairspring, designed to control the oscillating speed of the [[balance wheel]]. This crucial advance finally made accurate [[pocket watch]]es possible.&lt;ref name="Pockets"/&gt;  This resulted in a great advance in accuracy of pocket watches, from perhaps several hours per day to 10&amp;nbsp;minutes per day, similar to the effect of the pendulum upon mechanical clocks.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Milham | first= Willis I. | title=Time and Timekeepers | year=1945 | publisher=MacMillan | location=New York | isbn=0-7808-0008-7|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great English clockmaker, [[Thomas Tompion]], was one of the first to use this mechanism successfully in his pocket watches, and he adopted the minute hand which, after a variety of designs were trialled, eventually stabilised into the modern-day configuration.&lt;ref name="histworld"&gt;{{cite web|title=HISTORY OF CLOCKS|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=2324&amp;HistoryID=ac08&amp;gtrack=pthc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rev. [[Edward Barlow (priest)|Edward Barlow]] invented the rack and snail striking mechanism for [[striking clock]]s, which was a great improvement over the previous mechanism. The [[repeater (horology)|repeating clock]], that chimes the number of hours (or even minutes) was invented by either Quare or Barlow in 1676. [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] invented the [[Escapement#Deadbeat escapement|deadbeat escapement]] for clocks in 1720.

===Marine chronometer===

[[Marine chronometer]]s are clocks used at sea as [[time standard]]s, to determine [[longitude]] by [[celestial navigation]].&lt;ref name=marinechrono/&gt;
A major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would have to keep the time of a fixed location—usually [[Greenwich Mean Time]]—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock.&lt;ref name=marinechrono&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nawcc.org/museum/nwcm/galleries/marine/marine.htm |title=Marine Chronometers Gallery |accessdate=20 May 2008 |publisher=[[National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=manitoba&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manitobamuseum.ca/sg_marine.html |title=Science News – The Marine Chronometer |accessdate=20 May 2008 |first=Jérôme |last=Marchildon |publisher=[[Manitoba Museum]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919035618/http://www.manitobamuseum.ca/sg_marine.html|archivedate=September 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=longitudeprize&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/index.cfm/category/chronometers |title=Chronometers, precision watches, and timekeepers |publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]] |location=[[Greenwich]] |accessdate=20 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029165741/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/index.cfm/category/chronometers |archivedate=October 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.

[[Image:MIH-film12 color cerrected denoise.jpg|thumb|right|A twin-barrel box chronometer.]]
After the [[Scilly naval disaster of 1707]] where four ships ran aground due to navigational mistakes, the British government offered a large [[longitude prize|prize]] of £20,000, equivalent to millions of pounds today, for anyone who could determine longitude accurately. The reward was eventually claimed in 1761 by [[Yorkshire]] carpenter [[John Harrison]], who dedicated his life to improving the accuracy of his clocks.

In 1735 Harrison built his first chronometer, which he steadily improved on over the next thirty years before submitting it for examination. The clock had many innovations, including the use of bearings to reduce friction, weighted balances to compensate for the ship's pitch and roll in the sea and the use of two different metals to reduce the problem of expansion from heat.

The chronometer was trialled in 1761 by Harrison's son and by the end of 10 weeks the clock was in error by less than 5 seconds.&lt;ref name=gould&gt;{{cite book|author=Gould, Rupert T.|authorlink=Rupert Gould|title=The Marine Chronometer.

==Clock and watch-making industry==
{{Main article|Clockmaking|Watchmaking}}
[[Image:MontreGousset001.jpg|thumb|A [[pocket watch]]]]
The first professional clockmakers came from the [[guild]]s of [[locksmith]]s and [[jeweller]]s. Clockmaking developed from a specialized craft into a mass production industry over many years.&lt;ref name="Davies435" /&gt;

[[Paris]] and [[Blois]] were the early centres of clockmaking in France. French clockmakers such as [[Julien Le Roy]], clockmaker of [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], were leaders in case design and ornamental clocks.&lt;ref name="Davies435"&gt;Davies, Norman; p. 435&lt;/ref&gt; Le Roy belonged to the fifth generation of a family of clockmakers, and was described by his contemporaries as "the most skillful clockmaker in France, possibly in Europe". He invented a special repeating mechanism which improved the precision of clocks and watches, a face that could be opened to view the inside clockwork, and made or supervised over 3,500&amp;nbsp;watches. The competition and scientific rivalry resulting from his discoveries further encouraged researchers to seek new methods of measuring time more accurately.&lt;ref name="Leroy"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Getty Center]]|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker=556 |title=Julien Le Roy |accessdate=5 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1794 and 1795, in the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]], the French government briefly mandated [[decimal time|decimal clocks]], with a day divided into 10&amp;nbsp;hours of 100&amp;nbsp;minutes each.&lt;ref name="Alder"&gt;Alder, pp. 149–150&lt;/ref&gt; The astronomer and mathematician [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], among other individuals, modified the dial of his pocket watch to decimal time.&lt;ref name="Alder"/&gt; A clock in the [[Palais des Tuileries]] kept decimal time as late as 1801, but the cost of replacing all the nation's clocks prevented decimal clocks from becoming widespread.&lt;ref name="Alder162"&gt;Alder, pp. 150–162&lt;/ref&gt; Because decimalized clocks only helped astronomers rather than ordinary citizens, it was one of the most unpopular changes associated with the [[metric system]], and it was abandoned.&lt;ref name="Alder162"/&gt;

In Germany, [[Nuremberg]] and [[Augsburg]] were the early clockmaking centers, and the [[Black Forest]] came to specialize in wooden [[cuckoo clocks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Victorian Antiques|last=Shull|first=Thelma|publisher=C. E. Tuttle Co.|year=1963|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pocketwatch movement.png|thumb|left|220px|An antique pocket watch movement, from an 1891 encyclopedia.]]
The English became the predominant clockmakers of the 17th and 18th centuries. The main centres of the British industry were in the [[City of London]], the [[West End of London]], [[Soho]] where many skilled French [[Huguenot]]s settled and later in [[Clerkenwell]]. The [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers]] was established in 1631 as one of the [[Livery Companies]] of the City of London.

[[Thomas Tompion]] was the first English clockmaker with an international reputation and many of his pupils went on to become great horologists in their own right, such as [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] who invented the deadbeat escapement, orrery and mercury [[pendulum]], and his pupil [[Thomas Mudge (horologist)|Thomas Mudge]] who created the first [[lever escapement]]. Famous clockmakers of this period included [[Joseph Windmills]], Simon de Charmes who established the De Charmes clockmaker firm and [[Christopher Pinchbeck]] who invented the alloy [[Pinchbeck (alloy)|pinchbeck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22169|title=Clock and Watch-Making|publisher=British History Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later famous horologists included [[John Arnold (watchmaker)|John Arnold]] who made the first practical and accurate modern watch by refining Harrison's chronometer, [[Thomas Earnshaw]] who was the first to make these available to the public, [[Daniel Quare]], who invented a repeating watch movement, a portable barometer and introduced the concentric minute hand.

Quality control and standards were imposed on clockmakers by the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, a guild which licensed clockmakers for doing business. By the rise of [[consumerism]] in the late 18th century, clocks, especially pocket watches, became regarded as fashion accessories and were made in increasingly decorative styles. By 1796, the industry reached a high point with almost 200,000 clocks being produced annually in London, however by the mid-19th century the industry had gone into steep decline from Swiss competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=England: Where watchmaking all began|url=http://www.watchpro.com/england-where-watchmaking-all-began/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Switzerland established itself as a clockmaking center following the influx of [[Huguenot]] craftsmen, and in the 19th century, the Swiss industry "gained worldwide supremacy in high-quality machine-made watches". The leading firm of the day was [[Patek Philippe]], founded by [[Antoni Patek]] of [[Warsaw]] and [[Adrien Philippe]] of [[Bern]].&lt;ref name="Davies435"/&gt;

A '''virtual learning environment''' (VLE) is a system that creates an environment designed to facilitate teachers' management of educational courses for their students, especially a system using computer hardware and software, which involves distance learning. In North America, a virtual learning environment is often referred to as a "[[learning management system]]" (LMS).

* A five-year study of the impact of the PLATO system is published.&lt;ref name=Bitzer /&gt; Here are some highlights: "The results of exploratory queuing studies show that the system could teach as many as a thousand students simultaneously, while still allowing each student to proceed through the material independently." The PLATO system had two different ways to teach – "tutorial logic" where the system presented facts and examples, and then asked questions on the materials presented, and "inquiry logic" where the student could request and organize appropriate information from the computer. The presentation of materials ("slide selector") was called an ''electronic book''. The store of information in the system was called an ''electronic blackboard''. PLATO had a sophisticated ''help system'', whereby different types of wrong answers resulted in the student being sent different help sequences. A rudimentary ''spell checker'' was included in the system. A ''comment page'' allowed the student to comment on the lessons at any time. An ''instructor page'' allowed the instructor to communicate with the student. A "perfect workbook" recorded student responses to questions, as well as kept a ''record of each button the student pushed'' and the time at which he or she pushed it. These records were stored on magnetic tape for later ''statistical analysis''.

* The [[MITRE Corporation]] begins a year-long demonstration of the [[TICCIT]] system among Reston, Virginia cable television subscribers. Interactive television services included informational and educational demonstrations using a touch-tone telephone. The [[National Science Foundation]] refunds the PLATO project and funds MITRE's proposal to modify its TICCIT technology as a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) system to support English and algebra at community colleges. MITRE subcontracts instructional design and courseware authoring tasks to the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and [[Brigham Young University]].

** Skill Exchanges — which permit persons to list their skills, the conditions under which they are willing to serve as models for others who want to learn these skills, and the addresses at which they can be reached.
** Peer-Matching — a communications network which permits persons to describe the learning activity in which they wish to engage, in the hope of finding a partner for the inquiry.
** Reference Services to Educators-at-Large — who can be listed in a directory giving the addresses and self-descriptions of professionals, paraprofessionals, and free-lancers, along with conditions of access to their services.

* [[Patrick Suppes]], professor at [[Stanford University]], developed computer-based courses in [[Logic]] and [[Set Theory]] that were offered to Stanford undergraduates from 1972 to 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Suppes|first=Patrick|title=Computer Assistede Instruction|url=http://suppes-corpus.stanford.edu/articles/comped/278.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Learning Research Group is formed at [[Xerox PARC]] in Palo Alto, California. It is led by [[Alan Kay]], who advanced the idea of a graphical user interface (GUI) by inventing icons for folders, menus, and overlapping windows. Kay and his group envisioned a computer for teaching and learning that they called the "[https://web.archive.org/web/20120205105015/http://www.smalltalk.org/downloads/papers/SmalltalkHistoryHOPL.pdf KiddiKomputer]", to be programmed using the [[Smalltalk]] language they had developed. While Kay could see many educational uses for this computer, he had four initial projects in mind: 1) Teaching thinking skills, 2) Teaching modeling through the simulation of systems, 3) Teaching interface skills, and 4) Tracking what children would do with the computer outside school hours, when left to their own devices. Second level projects for teaching children with a computer included 1) Computer evaluation, 2) Iconic programming, especially for children under 8. Kay and his colleagues started teaching programming to children and adults in 1973.

* A report written for the University of Michigan described the educational uses of computers at the university. These included "drill, skills practice, programmed and dialog tutorials, testing and diagnosis, simulation, gaming, information processing, computation, problem solving, model construction, graphic display, the management of instructional resources, and the presentation and display of materials."&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, Karl (1973) Contributions of Computing to College Teaching and Learning Activities at the University of Michigan.

* An integrated student information system at Trinity University in Texas maintained data on about 1,500 variables. These included all student academic and personal data, all faculty data that dealt with courses and teaching, all course data in regards to student, faculty and class meeting times and days, enrollments, buildings, and the college calendar and catalog. There was also "an interaction course management system".&lt;ref&gt;Yost, Michael (1973) Extracting Data from Integrated Student Information Systems. ERIC Document ED244563.&lt;/ref&gt;
* As a post-doc at [[Carnegie-Mellon University]], Jay Warner needed to teach undergraduate metallurgy students how to use new software that would calculate phase diagrams (graphical representations of metal states/phases as a function of composition and temperature) based on thermodynamic properties. He wrote a CAI (Computer-Assisted Instruction) module that, however crudely, used some of the principles discussed in this article. A frame, or paragraph of information, was presented, and the machine branched to different follow-up frames and questions depending on the response to the embedded questions. The whole thing was written in FORTRAN IV. It proved useful; students could then use the software without close attendance by the instructor. This work was in no way as dramatic as the other accomplishments of the day, however it does show that by this time CAL was not restricted to studies of learning methods.

* [[Prestel]], claimed by BT as "the world's first public viewdata service", was opened in London in September, running on a cluster of minicomputers. It had been conceived in the early 1970s by [[Samuel Fedida]] of the Post Office Research Laboratories at Dollis Hill, London. Similar developments were under way in France (Teletel) and Canada (Telidon). Only those active at the time will remember the sense of euphoria and opening of possibilities in what would now be called the e-business and e-learning worlds. (Sadly, the concept was premature, although in France it had most success.) A number of mainframe, minicomputer and even micro-computer based systems and services were later developed in educational circles of which perhaps the best known were OPTEL, Communitel, ECCTIS and NERIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bt.com/archives/history/19691980.htm| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20021215160137/http://www.bt.com/archives/history/19691980.htm | archivedate = 2002-12-15| title = Events in Telecommunications History| accessdate = 2006-08-14| author = British Telecommunications}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Canada, groups including [[TVOntario]], [[Athabasca University]], the [[University of Victoria]], and the [[University of Waterloo]] participated in [http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/telidon/telidon_twoway.html Telidon] experiments during the late 70s and early 80s. [[Telidon]], an alphageometric videotex information system used set-top boxes with TV sets, or subsequently software decoders running on PCs (Apple II, MAC, and PC decoders were available) to display text and graphics. The intent was to demonstrate and develop educational applications for videotex and teletext systems. This [http://www.amtec.ca/cjlt/vol15no2.pdf work continued until 1983], when the Telidon coding structure became a North American standard – ANSI T500 – NAPLPS (North American Presentation Layer Protocol Syntax).
* The Athabasca University educational Telidon project used a Unix path structure which allowed the storage of information pages in the file system tree. This is now the universal storage method for pages on the internet. As described, the system had the ability to create separate user groups with different access privileges, and to implement "action scripts" to access system functions, including email and dynamic content generation. The AU system was described in Abell, R.A. "Implementation of a Telidon System Using UNIX File Structures" in Godfrey, D. and Chang, E. (eds) The Telidon Book, Reston Publishing Company, Reston, VA, 1981)

==1980s==

===1980===
* Successmaker is a K–12 learning management system with an emphasis on reading, spelling and numeracy. According to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080517032227/http://www.pearsondigital.com/successes/successmaker/southcolonie.cfm Pearson Digital Learning website], the South Colonie Central School District in Albany, New York "has been using SuccessMaker since 1980, and in 1997 the district upgraded the software to SuccessMaker version 5.5."
* The Open University begins a pilot trial of a viewdata (videotex) system OPTEL, on a [[DECSYSTEM-20|DEC-20]] mainframe. This had been conceived by Peter Zorkoczy even before the launch of the national Prestel system in 1979 and was locally specified and coded (in [[COBOL]]) by Peter Frogbrook (RIP) and Gyan Mathur. One of the main motivations was its applicability to online learning. It was available via dial-up from home, and later in the 1980s via telnet(!) on the [[X.25]] and internet networks. There were individual user codes and passwords, giving different access rights; the one generic access code was regularly attacked by [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] even in these far-off days, as URLs still on the web attest. The system is overviewed in [http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/recordDetails.jsp?accno=ED247893&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=Viewdata-Style+Delivery+Mechanisms+for+CAL&amp;_pageLabel=RecordDetails&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=kw"Viewdata-Style Delivery Mechanisms for CAL", CAL Research Group Technical Report No. 11.]
* [[Seymour Papert]] at [[MIT]] publishes "Mindstorms: children, computers, and powerful ideas". (New York: Basic Books).

* The idea of ''managing teaching resources using a computer'' is described in a paper by J.M. Leclerc and S. Normand from the [[University of Montreal]]. Their system was programmed in [[BASIC]], and used a computer to track documents, human resources, structured activities, and places for training and observation. Evaluation activities were also available in the system.&lt;ref&gt;Leclerc, J.M. and Normand, S. (1980) A general management system for university teaching resources. In Swail, E. and Neal, G. (Eds.)

* TLM (The Learning Manager) was released in 1980 and included distinct roles for students, instructors, educational assistants, and administrators. The system could be accessed remotely by dial-up as a student or an instructor using a terminal emulator. The system had a sophisticated test bank capability and generated tests and practice activities based on a learning objective data structure. Instructors and students could communicate through the terminal. Instructors could lock out students or post messages. Originally called LMS (Learning Management System), TLM was used extensively at SAIT (Southern Alberta Institute of Technology) and Bow Valley College, both located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w-win.com/learningmanagementsystems/history/ |title=The Learning Manager&amp;reg |publisher=W-win.com |accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Field trials begin of the Cyclops whiteboard system in the East Midlands Region of the Open University and run for two years. The evaluation was funded by a grant from British Telecom and allowed the evaluation Director Tony Bates to employ Mike Sharples and David McConnell as research fellows. Audio-visual material for Cyclops was produced on the ''Cyclops Studio '', a multimedia editing system coded in UCSD Pascal by a software team led by Paul Bacsich and including Mark Woodman. Cyclops was later awarded a BCS prize for innovation and systems installed in Indonesia. There are only passing references now to Cyclops on the open Web (see under names cited) – the best source of specifications and chronology is the article "Cyclops:shared-screen teleconferencing" in ''The Role of Technology in Distance Education'', edited Tony Bates, Croom Helm, 1984.&lt;ref name=Bates&gt;Bates, Tony &amp; Helm, Croom, eds. (1984). ''The Role of Technology in Distance Education''. Retrieved on 2006-08-15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Over this period the Open University was also developing its own viewdata (videotex) system, called OPTEL, for use in education. This had in fact started about the same time as Cyclops in yet another team at the OU. The project ran until about 1985 when it faded away, as did videotex generally across the world (except the Minitel in France). In addition to OPTEL, several other systems were implemented including VOS (Videotex Operating System) which allowed the display and manipulation of text files via videotex. VOS was further developed into a telesoftware, transactional (gateway) and email system and then used in a commercial development for IMS, the media research company (using a very early precursor of Web/CGI development). These were coded in Pascal and COBOL on the [[DECSYSTEM-20|DEC-20]] mainframe. Some of the ideas of OPTEL were taken over into the ECCTIS project delivering course data via viewdata from a Unisys mainframe – indeed one of the former OPTEL staff joined ECCTIS as Director. Systems were also specified to deliver Computer-Assisted Learning – see in particular the article "Viewdata systems" in ''The Role of Technology in Distance Education''.&lt;ref name=Bates /&gt; There are only fragmentary references now to OPTEL on the open Web.

(Only [http://www.ed.psu.edu/acsde/deos/deosnews/deosnews1_11.asp one reference] online.) It is believed that the work started in the late 1970s under the supervision of Peter Zorkcoczy, who also conceived the OPTEL viewdata system. Radiotext denoted the transmission of data over radio signals, just as it can be sent over telephone lines. It may seem normal now, as in the [[Radio Data System]] (RDS) in these days of digital radio, but in the 1970s the concept was novel and complex for their colleagues to grasp.

* 1987, Glenn Jones of Jones Intercable in Denver, Colorado believed he saw a potential goldmine when he created a new system, called Mind Extension University in 1987. Jones created a system where telecourses could be provided across a network to various colleges and at the same time, students could interact with the instructors and each other, by using email, sent over the internet. Jones then began to beam the courses by satellite, so anyone with a satellite dish could watch the classes and if they had a computer and a phone line they could interact with the class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jiu.edu/about/faces/profiles/glenn_jones.php Jones International University]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A group of companies in Alberta, working with Alberta Government Telephones, create a pre-internet "whiteboard-like" audiographic teleconferencing system. Using PCs, specialized NAPLPS-based software, and audioconferencing bridges, the system shares graphics, text, and voice, for synchronous multipoint instructor/student student/student communication. The system was used by the Commonwealth of Learning in several locations around the globe, and was also used by Arctic College in Alaska for distance education. In some implementations, the students uploaded assignments to instructors for marking. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===1991===
* In datacloud|''Datacloud: Toward a New Theory of Online Work'', Johndan Johnson-Eilola describes a specific computer-supported collaboriation space: [[smart board|The Smart Board]], which was introduced in 1991. According to Johnson-Eilola, a “Smart Board system provides a 72-inch, rear projection, touchscreen, intelligent whiteboard surface for work” (79). In datacloud|''Datacloud'', Johnson-Eilola asserts that “[w]e are attempting to understand how users move within information spaces, how users can exist within information spaces rather than merely gaze at them, and how information spaces must be shared with others rather than being private, lived within rather than simply visited” (82). He explains how the Smart Board system offers an information space that allows his students to engage in active collaboration. He makes three distinct claims regarding the functionality of the technology: 1) The Smart Board allows users to work with large amounts of information, 2) It offers an information space that invites active collaboration, 3) The work produced is often “dynamic and contingent” (82).&lt;ref name="Johnson-Eilola, Johndan 2005"&gt;Johnson-Eilola, Johndan. Datacloud: Toward a New Theory of Online Work. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press, Inc., 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deployment''' of '''Internet Protocol Version 6''' ([[IPv6]]), the next generation of the [[Internet Protocol]], has been in progress since the mid-2000s.

IPv6 was designed as a replacement for [[IPv4]] which has been in use since 1982, and is in the final stages of [[IPv4 address exhaustion|exhausting its unallocated address space]], but still carries most Internet traffic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bgp.potaroo.net/index-bgp.html |title=BGP Analysis Reports |accessdate=2013-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google's statistics show IPv6 availability of its users up to 25% &lt;!-- on two Saturdays--&gt;  depending on the day of the week (more use on weekends), with use over 20% any day of the week {{as of|2018|07|alt=since July 2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html|title=IPv6 – Google|publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adoption is uneven across countries and Internet service providers.

&lt;!-- when those numbers are updated, also update the main page percentages please --&gt;
In November 2016, 1491 (98.2%) of the 1519 [[top-level domain]]s (TLDs) in the Internet supported IPv6 to access their domain name servers, and 1485 (97.8%) zones contained IPv6 [[Domain Name System|glue records]], and approximately 9.0 million domains (4.6%) had IPv6 address records in their zones. Of all networks in the global BGP routing table, 29.2% had IPv6 protocol support.&lt;ref name=hestat&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=RIPE NCC|title=IPv6 Enabled Networks|url=http://v6asns.ripe.net/v/6?s=_ALL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2011, all major operating systems in use on personal computers and server systems had production-quality IPv6 implementations. Cellular telephone systems present a large deployment field for Internet Protocol devices as mobile telephone service is making the transition from [[3G]] to "next-generation" [[4G]] technologies, in which voice is provisioned as a [[voice over IP]] (VoIP) service. This mandates the use of IPv6 for such networks. In 2009, the US cellular operator [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] released technical specifications for devices to operate on its "next-generation" networks.&lt;ref name="verizon"&gt;{{cite web|author=Derek Morr|title=Verizon Mandates IPv6 Support for Next-Gen Cell Phones|url=http://www.circleid.com/posts/20090609_verizon_mandates_ipv6_support_for_next_gen_cell_phones/|publisher=CircleID|date=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specification mandates IPv6 operation according to the ''3GPP Release 8 Specifications (March 2009)'', and deprecates IPv4 as an optional capability.&lt;ref name="verizon" /&gt;

==Deployment evaluation tools==
[[File:IPv6-as.svg|thumb|Number of IPv6 prefixes and AS on the Internet since 2003]]
[[File:Rir-ipv6-allocation-rate.svg|thumb|Monthly IPv6 allocations per RIR]]

Google publishes statistics on IPv6 adoption among Google users. A graph of IPv6 adoption since 2008 and a map of IPv6 deployment by country are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/ipv6/statistics.html#tab=ipv6-adoption |title=IPv6 adoption |publisher=Google |date= |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.google.com/ipv6/statistics.html#tab=per-country-ipv6-adoption |title=Per-country IPv6 adoption |publisher=Google |date= |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akamai publishes by-country and by-network statistics on IPv6 adoption for traffic it sees on its global Content Distribution Network (CDN).  This set of data also shows graphs for each country and network over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.akamai.com/us/en/our-thinking/state-of-the-internet-report/state-of-the-internet-ipv6-adoption-visualization.jsp |title=IPv6 adoption visualization |publisher=Akamai |date= |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A global view into the history of the growing IPv6 routing tables can be obtained with the SixXS Ghost Route Hunter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sixxs.net/tools/grh/ |title=SixXS Ghost Route Hunter |publisher=Sixxs.net |date= |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tool provided a list of all allocated IPv6 prefixes until 2014 and marks with colors the ones that were actually being announced into the Internet BGP tables. When a prefix was announced, it means that the [[Internet service provider|ISP]] at least can receive IPv6 packets for their prefix.

The integration of IPv6 on existing network infrastructure may be monitored from other sources, for example:
* [[Regional Internet registry|Regional Internet registries]] (RIR) IPv6 prefix allocation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://v6asns.ripe.net/v/6?s=_ALL;s=CH;s=DE;s=JP;s=FR;s=US;s=BE;s=PE|title=IPv6 Enabled Networks|work=ripe.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IPv6 testing, evaluation, and certification===
A few organizations are involved with international IPv6 test and evaluation, ranging from the United States Department of Defense to the University of New Hampshire.

* The US DoD [[Joint Interoperability Test Command]] [[DoD IPv6 Product Certification]] Program
* [[University of New Hampshire InterOperability Laboratory]] involvement in the IPv6 Ready Logo Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipv6ready.org|title=IPv6 Ready Logo Site - Home|work=ipv6ready.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
The [[China Next Generation Internet]] (CNGI, 中国下一代互联网) project is a five-year plan initiated by the Chinese government with the purpose of gaining a significant position in the development of the Internet through the early adoption of IPv6. China showcased CNGI's IPv6 infrastructure during the [[2008 Summer Olympic Games]], being the first time a major world event has had a presence on the IPv6 Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipv6.beijing2008.cn/en |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707013209/http://ipv6.beijing2008.cn/en |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the event, it was believed that the Olympics provided the largest showcase of IPv6 technology since the inception of IPv6.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The deployment of IPv6 was widespread in all related applications, from [[data networking]] and camera transmissions for sporting events, to civil applications, such as [[security camera]]s and [[Taxicab|taxi]]s. The events were [[Streaming media|streamed]] live over the Internet and networked cars were able to monitor [[traffic]] conditions readily, all network operations of the Games being conducted using IPv6.&lt;ref name="beijing2008-pressrelease"&gt;

==History==
ip.access was founded in December 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ttp.com/corporate/about/ |title= About TTP |publisher= TTP Group |accessdate= June 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a wholly owned [[subsidiary]] of TTP Group PLC&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ttpgroup.com/about/TTP TTP Group PLC]&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at developing technologies that would allow multiple radio access technologies to communicate over the Internet. To accommodate its growing staff, in 2006 ip.access relocated to new offices in Cambourne Business Park, Cambridge, where it remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press |url=http://www.ipaccess.com/content/news/press.php?id=20 |title=ip.access Moves to New Offices to Support Growth |publisher= ip.access| accessdate= June 3, 2011 | date=September 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2000, TTP Group spun off its communications division (TTP Communications, or TTPCom) in an [[initial public offering]] on the [[London Stock Exchange]], and ip.access joined the spin-off as a wholly owned subsidiary of the TTPCom group.

In March 2006, the company secured an £8.5 million round of funding from [[Intel Capital]], Scottish Equity Partners, and [[Rothschild &amp; Cie Banque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press |url= http://www.ipaccess.com/content/news/press.php?id=27 |title=ip.access Secures £8.5 million Funding to Accelerate Growth in Cost-Effective Cellular Infrastructure for Homes and Businesses |publisher= ip.access| accessdate= June 3, 2011 | date=March 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its June 2006 acquisition of TTP Communications, [[Motorola]] also gained a stake in ip.access.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/06/07/motorola_buys_ttpcom/ Motorola gobbles up TTPcom], ''The Register'', June 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, after signing an OEM agreement with ip.access, [[ADC Telecommunications|ADC]]&lt;ref&gt;Cheung, Ken.

==Brands and companies==
* [[All-Clad]] – At the time of its founding, All-Clad used a patented "[[roll bonding]]" process in which metals are sandwiched together and then formed into a cooking vessel. The company derived its name from this cladding process, which is applied not only on the bottom but extends all the way up the sides of each cooking vessel. The company has been issued several patents by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=USPTO|work=  3350772 |title=Methods of cladding stainless steel to aluminum|date= November 7, 1967|author1=Ulam, John B.  |author2=Camp, William C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Chue Chin Hua]] – an aluminium cookware and metal producing company in Thailand

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4142">This is a partial list of text and image '''duplicating processes''' used in business and government from the [[Industrial Revolution]] forward.  Some are mechanical and some are chemical.  There is naturally some overlap with printing processes and photographic processes, but the challenge of precisely duplicating business letters, forms, contracts, and other paperwork prompted some unique solutions as well.  There were many short-lived [[invention]]s along the way.

==Duplicating processes==
''Within each type, the methods are arranged in very rough chronological order.''

This is a '''list of the shortest airport runways''' in the world.  While most modern commercial aircraft require a paved runway of at least 6000 feet in length, many early aircraft were designed to operate from unprepared strips that could be improvised in small spaces. Los Angeles's [[Grand Central Airport (California)|Grand Central Airport]], considered a landmark in aviation history, had a 1200 foot runway during its first six years of operation from 1923 to 1929.&lt;ref&gt;[http://airportjournals.com/a-journey-back-in-time-grand-central-air-terminal/ Airport Journals: A Journey Back in Time - Grand Central Air Terminal]&lt;/ref&gt;  Such airstrips were used by heavy as well as light aircraft.  During the [[Doolittle Raid]] in [[World War II|WW II]], twin-engine [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25]] bombers with a loaded weight of seventeen tons took off from the 827-foot flight deck of the carrier [[USS Hornet (CV-8)|USS ''Hornet'']].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/04/doolittle-raiders-anniversary-world-war-two-history/ National Geographic: Trained in Secret, These Fearless Pilots Retaliated for Pearl Harbor]&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1977 a [[Lockheed Constellation]] demonstrated its ability to use the 2700 foot runway of the [[Greenwood Lake Airport]] in [[New Jersey]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RkC-a4jjxU YouTube: Connie Arrives at Greenwood Lake - 4N1]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1946, a lightened Constellation took off from a grass strip in 2000 feet on only three engines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historynet.com/the-legendary-lockheed-constellation.htm HistoryNet: The Legendary Lockheed Constellation]&lt;/ref&gt; Most general aviation aircraft retain this short-field performance; the [[Cessna 172]], the most successful aircraft in history, will take off in as little as 720 feet when fully loaded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guatemala-skies.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Cessna172TakeoffDistance.png Cessna 172 Pilot's Operating Handbook: Takeoff Distance]&lt;/ref&gt; Many small airfields capable of accommodating these types remain in use, mostly in remote areas in the American West and French Alps, where space is limited.

'''Low technology''', often abbreviated '''low tech''' (adjective forms '''low-technology''', '''low-tech''', '''lo-tech''') is simple technology, often of a traditional or non-mechanical kind, such as [[crafts]] and [[tool]]s that pre-date the [[Industrial Revolution]]. It is the opposite of [[high technology]].

Low technology can typically be practised or fabricated with a minimum of [[capital (economics)|capital]] investment by an individual or small group of individuals. Also, the knowledge of the practice can be completely comprehended by a single individual, free from increasing [[Departmentalization|specialization]] and [[wikt:compartmentalization|compartmentalization]]. Low-tech techniques and designs may fall into disuse due to changing socio-economic conditions or priorities.

==Examples of low technology==

'''Note:''' almost all of the entries in this section should be prefixed by the word ''traditional''.

* [[weaving]] produced on non-automated looms, and [[basketry]].
* hand [[wood-working]], [[joiner]]y, [[coopering]], and [[carpentry]].
* the trade of the [[shipwright|ship-wright]].
* the trade of the [[Wheelwright|wheel-wright]].
* the trade of the [[wainwright]]: making wagons. (the Latin word for a two-wheeled ''wagon'' is ''carpentum'', the maker of which was a ''carpenter''.)

(''Wright'' is the [[agent form]] of the word ''wrought'', which itself is the original [[past passive participle]] of the word ''work'', now superseded by the [[Light verb|weak verb]] forms ''worker'' and ''worked'' respectively.)

* [[blacksmithing]] and the various related [[smithing]] and metal-crafts.
* [[folk music]] played on [[acoustic instruments]].
* [[mathematics]] (particularly, ''[[pure mathematics]]'')
* [[organic farming]] and [[animal husbandry]] (i.e.; agriculture as practiced by all American farmers prior to World War II).
* [[Mill (grinding)|milling]] in the sense of operating hand-constructed equipment with the intent to either grind grain, or the reduction of timber to lumber as practiced in a [[saw-mill]].
* [[fulling]], [[felt]]ing, [[spindle (textiles)|drop spindle]] spinning, [[hand knitting]], [[crochet]], &amp; similar textile preparation.
* the production of [[charcoal]] by the [[Charcoal maker|collier]], for use in [[home heating]], [[foundry]] operations, [[smelting]], the various [[smithing]] trades, and for brushing ones teeth as in [[Colonial America]].
* [[glass-blowing]].
* various subskills of [[food preservation]]:
** [[Smoking (food)|smoking]]
** [[salting (food)|salting]]
** [[pickling]]
** [[drying (food)|drying]]

'''Note''': [[home canning]] is a counter example of a '''low technology''' since some of the supplies needed to pursue this skill rely on a [[global trade network]] and an existing manufacturing [[infrastructure]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

* the production of various [[alcoholic beverage]]s:
** [[wine]]: poorly preserved fruit juice.
** [[beer]]: a way to preserve the calories of grain products from decay.
** [[whiskey]]: an improved ([[distilled]]) form of beer.
* [[flint-knapping]]
* [[masonry]] as used in [[castles]], [[cathedrals]], and [[root cellar]]s.

==Legal status of low-technology==
{{See also|Handicraft|Organic food|Natural foods}}
By federal law in the United States, only those articles produced with little or no use of machinery or tools with complex mechanisms may be stamped with the designation "hand-wrought" or "hand-made". Lengthy court-battles are currently underway over the precise definition of the terms "organic" and "natural" as applied to [[foodstuff]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Groups associated with low-technology==
* [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], popularized by [[Gustav Stickley]] in America around 1900.
* [[Bauhaus]] movement of Germany around the same time.
* [[Do-It-Yourself]] phenomenon arising in America following [[World War II]].
* [[Back-to-the-land movement]] beginning in America during the 1960s.
* [[Luddites]], whose activities date to the very beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]].
* Living history and [[open-air museum]]s around the world, which strive to recreate bygone societies.
* [[Simple living]] adherents, such as the [[Amish]] and to a lesser extent some sects of the [[Mennonites]], who specifically refuse some newer technologies to avoid undesirable effects on themselves or their societies.
* [[Survivalists]] are often proponents,{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} since low-technology is inherently more [[:wikt:robust|robust]] than its [[high-technology]] counterpart.

'''Nanosocialism''' refers generally to a set of [[economics|economic theories]] of [[social organization]] advocating [[State (polity)|state]] or [[collective ownership]] and administration of the [[research and development|research, development]] and use of [[nanotechnology]].

== Politics ==

{{further|Regulation of nanotechnology}}

Nanosocialism is a stance that favors [[participatory politics]] to guide [[state intervention]] in the effort to manage the transition to a [[society]] revolutionized by [[molecular nanotechnology]].&lt;ref name="Berube 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = Berube, David|    title = Nanosocialism|    year = 1996 |   url = http://www.cas.sc.edu/engl/faculty/berube/nanosoc.htm| accessdate=2007-01-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061225060622/http://www.cas.sc.edu/engl/faculty/berube/nanosoc.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = [[James Hughes (sociologist)|Hughes, James]]|    title = Politics of Transhumanism|    year = 2001 |   url = http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/TranshumPolitics.htm| accessdate=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Nanosocialism" is a term coined by [[David M. Berube]], the associate director of Nanoscience and Technology Studies at the USC NanoCenter, who argues that nanotechnological projections need to be tempered by [[technorealism]] about the [[implications of nanotechnology]] in a [[technocapitalist]] society, but that its [[List of nanotechnology applications|applications]] also offer enormous opportunities for [[abundance (economics)|economic abundance]] and [[social progress]].&lt;ref name="Berube 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes 2001"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
In the [[role-playing game]] ''[[Transhuman Space]]'', nanosocialism is described as a descendant of [[infosocialism]], in which [[intellectual property]] is [[nationalization|nationalized]] and freely distributed by the state. It is adopted by some developing nations to counter the hold corporations from wealthier nations have on [[copyright]]s and [[patent]]s. This fictional version of nanosocialism was coined by [[David L. Pulver]], the game's creator, who was unaware that the term had already been used by Berube.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7271">'''OPeNDAP''' is an acronym for "'''Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol'''," an endeavor focused on enhancing the retrieval of remote, structured data through a Web-based architecture and a discipline-neutral Data Access Protocol (DAP). Widely used, especially in [[Earth science]], the protocol is layered on [[HTTP]], and its current specification is DAP4,&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.opendap.org/index.php/DAP4_Specification DAP4 Specification]&lt;/ref&gt; though the previous DAP2 version remains broadly used. Developed and advanced (openly and collaboratively) by the non-profit [http://opendap.org/ OPeNDAP, Inc.], DAP is intended to enable remote, selective data-retrieval as an easily invoked Web service. OPeNDAP, Inc. also develops and maintains zero-cost (reference) implementations of the DAP protocol in both server-side and client-side software. 

"OPeNDAP" often is used in place of "DAP" to denote the protocol but also may refer to an entire DAP-based data-retrieval architecture. Other DAP-centered architectures, such as [https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/tds/ THREDDS] and ERDDAP,&lt;ref&gt;[https://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html The NOAA GEO-IDE UAF ERDDAP]&lt;/ref&gt; exhibit significant interoperability with one another as well as with systems employing OPeNDAP's own (open-source) servers and software.

A DAP client can be an ordinary browser or even a spreadsheet, though with limited functionality (see OPeNDAP's Web page on [https://www.opendap.org/support/OPeNDAP-clients Available Client Software]). More typically, DAP clients are:
* Data-analysis or data-visualization tools (such as [[MATLAB]], [[IDL (programming language)|IDL]], [[Panoply]], [[GrADS]], [[IDV]], [[Ferret Data Visualization and Analysis|Ferret]] and ncBrowse&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/epic/java/ncBrowse/ A Graphical netCDF File Browser]&lt;/ref&gt;) which their authors have adapted to enable DAP-based data input;
* Similarly adapted Web applications (such as Dapper Data Viewer, aka DChart)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/epic/software/dchart/ OPeNDAP software]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Similarly adapted end-user programs (in common languages)

Regardless of their types, and whether developed commercially or by an end-user, clients almost universally link to DAP servers through ''libraries'' that implement the DAP2 or DAP4 protocol in one language or another. OPeNDAP offers open-source libraries in [[C++]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], but many clients rely on community developed libraries such as [https://github.com/pydap/pydap PyDAP] or, especially, the [[NetCDF]] suite. Developed and maintained by the Unidata Program at the [[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research|UCAR]] in multiple programming languages, all [[NetCDF]] libraries include embedded capabilities for retrieving (array-style) data from DAP servers.

A data-using client references a [[data set]] by its URL and requests metadata or content by issuing (usually through an embedded DAP library) an HTTP request to a DAP server. Content requests usually are ''preceded'' by requests for metadata describing the structure and other details about the referenced data set. With this information, the client may construct DAP constraint expressions&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.opendap.org/index.php/DAP4:_Specification_Volume_1#Constraints DAP constraint expressions]&lt;/ref&gt; to retrieve specific content (i.e., subsets) from the source. OPeNDAP servers offer various types of responses, depending on the specific form of the client's request, including XML, JSON, HTML and ASCII. In response to requests for ''content'', OPeNDAP servers can respond with multi-part mime documents that include a binary portion with [[NetCDF]] or DAP-native encoding. (These binary forms offer compact means to deliver large volumes of content, and the DAP-native form may even be streamed if desired.)

OPeNDAP's software for building DAP servers (on top of [[Apache]]) is dubbed Hyrax and includes ''adapters'' that facilitate serving a wide variety of source data. DAP servers most frequently enable (remote) access to (large) [[Hierarchical Data Format|HDF]] or NetCDF files, but the source data can exist in databases or other formats, including user-defined ones. When source data are organized as files, DAP retrievals enable, via [[subsetting]], finer-grained access than does the [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]]. Furthermore, OPeNDAP servers can aggregate subsets from multiple files for delivery in a single retrieval. Taken together, subsetting, aggregation and streaming can yield substantial data-access efficiencies, even in the presence of slow networks.

OPeNDAP and other DAP servers are used operationally in government agencies, including [[NASA]] and [[NOAA]], for providing access to [[Earth science]] data, including satellite imagery and other high-volume information sources. The DAP data model embraces a comprehensive set of data structures, including multidimensional arrays and nested sequences (i.e., records), complemented by a correspondingly rich set of constraint expressions. Hence the OPeNDAP data-retrieval architecture has demonstrated utility across a broad range of scientific data types, including data generated via simulations and data generated via observations (whether remotely sensed or measured in situ).

[[File:Ford manual 1919.djvu|thumb|262x262px]]

An '''owner's manual''' (also called an '''instruction manual''' or a '''user guide''') is an instructional [[book]] or [[book]]let that is supplied with almost all technologically advanced consumer products such as [[vehicles]], [[home appliances]] and [[computer peripheral]]s.
Information contained in the owner's manual typically includes:
* [[Safety]] instructions; for [[Legal liability|liability]] reasons these can be extensive, often including warnings against performing operations that are ill-advised for product longevity or overall user safety reasons.
* Assembly instructions; for products that arrive in pieces for easier shipping.
* Installation instructions; for products that need to be installed in a home or workplace.
* Setup instructions; for devices that keep track of time or which maintain user accessible state.
* Instructions for normal or intended operations.
* [[Computer programming|Programming]] instructions; for [[microprocessor]] controlled products such as [[VCR]]s, [[programmable calculator]]s, and [[synthesizer]]s.
* [[Preventive maintenance|Maintenance]] instructions.
* [[Troubleshooting]] instructions; for when the product does not work as expected.
* Service locations; for when the product requires [[repair]] by a factory authorized [[technician]].
* [[Regulation|Regulatory code]] compliance information; for example with respect to safety or [[electromagnetic interference]].
* Product [[technical specifications]].
* [[Warranty]] information; sometimes provided as a separate sheet.

Until the last decade or two of the twentieth century it was common for an owner's manual to include detailed [[repair]] information, such as a [[circuit diagram]]; however as products became more complex this information was gradually relegated to specialized [[service manual]]s, or dispensed with entirely, as devices became too inexpensive to be economically repaired.

Owner's manuals for simpler devices are often [[multilingual]] so that the same boxed product can be sold in many different markets. Sometimes the same manual is shipped with a range of related products so the manual will contain a number of sections that apply only to some particular model in the product range.

With the increasing complexity of modern devices, many owner's manuals have become so large that a separate [[quickstart guide]] is provided. Some owner's manuals for computer equipment are supplied on [[CD-ROM]] to cut down on manufacturing costs, since the owner is assumed to have a computer able to read the CD-ROM. Another trend is to supply instructional video material with the product, such as a [[videotape]] or [[DVD]], along with the owner's manual.

Many businesses offer [[PDF]] copies of manuals that can be accessed or downloaded free of charge from their websites.

== Installation manual ==
An installation manual or installation guide is a [[Technical communication|technical communication]] [[Document|document]] intended to instruct people how to install a particular product. An installation manual is usually written by a [[Technical writer|technical writer]] or other technical staff. 

Installation is the act of putting something in place so that it is ready for use.&lt;ref&gt;Definition of “installation” from the Cambridge Academic Content Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; An installation manual most commonly describes the safe and correct installation of a product. The term product here relates to any consumer, non-consumer, hardware, software, electrical, electronic or mechanical product that requires installation. The installation of a computer program is also known as the [[Installation (computer programs)|setup]].
[[Image:Installatiehandleiding rollend hekwerk installatie.jpg|thumb|link=https://www.manualise.com/en/installation-manual/|250px|A sample of an installation manual]]
In case of an installation manual, the installation instruction is a separate document that focuses solely on the person(s) that will perform the installation. However, the installation instruction can also be an integrated part of the overall owner's manual.

The size, structure and content of an installation manual depend heavily on the nature of the product and the needs and capabilities of the intended target group. Furthermore, various standards and directives are available that provide guidance and requirements for the design of instructions.

The international standard IEC 82079&lt;ref&gt;IEC 82079-1:2012, p. 31, 5 Content of instructions for use&lt;/ref&gt; prescribes the required installation topics for an installation instruction. Among these topics, are procedures, diagrams and conditions for installation activities, such as unpacking, mounting and connecting.

For machines the European Machinery Directive prescribes that an instruction manual must contain assembly, installation and connecting instructions, including drawings, diagrams and the means of attachment and the designation of the chassis or installation on which the machinery is to be mounted.&lt;ref&gt;Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on machinery, and amending Directive 95/16/EC , p. 25-26, 1.7.4.2 Contents of the instructions.&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Car owner's manuals ==
All new cars come with an owner's manual from the manufacturer. Most owners leave them in the [[glove compartment]] for easy reference. This can make their frequent absence in [[rental car]]s frustrating because it violates the driver's [[user expectations]], as well as makes it difficult to use controls that aren't understood, which is not good because understanding control operation of an unfamiliar car is one of the first steps recommended in [[defensive driving]]. Owner's manuals usually cover three main areas: a description of the location and operation of all controls; a schedule and descriptions of maintenance required, both by the owner and by a mechanic; and specifications such as oil and fuel capacity and part numbers of light bulbs used. Current car owner's manuals have become much bigger in part due to many safety warnings most likely designed to avoid [[product liability]] lawsuits, as well as from ever more complicated audio and navigational systems, which often have their own manual.

If owners lose their car manual, they can either order a replacement from a dealer, pick up a used one secondhand, or download a PDF version of the manual online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.edmunds.com/how-to/how-to-find-your-car-owners-manual-online.html |title = How to Find Your Car Owner's Manual Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the next generation of digitized car manuals came online, which use [[Watson_(computer)|IBM Watson]] Artificial Intelligence to understand and and answer questions in natural driver language&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/2017/11/end-of-the-car-manual/&lt;/ref&gt;. "Ask Mercedes" was the first in a wave of these vehicle assistants which can support both speech and text-based input.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.diplomaticsales.mercedes-benz.com/passengercars/being-an-owner/ask-mercedes-campaign/stage.module.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer) Official website]

== Popular culture ==
The [[noun phrase]] ''owner's manual'' has been used by [[analogy]] in the title of numerous instructional books about entities that are not manufactured products, such as [[pet]]s, body parts and [[business]]es.

== User guides ==
The equivalent document for [[computer software]] is called a [[user guide]] since [[User (computing)|users]] are typically [[license]]es rather than [[owner]]s of the software.

== Unicode ==
The OPEN BOOK ([[Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs|📖]]) Unicode symbol equals ''read operator's manual''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F300.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; OPEN BOOK has Unicode code point U+1F4D6.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3938">'''Peer-to-peer video sharing''' is a basic service on top of the [[IP Multimedia Subsystem]] (IMS).
Early proprietary implementations might also run a simple SIP infrastructure, too.

The [[GSM Association]] calls it "Video Share". The peer-to-peer video sharing functionality is defined by the Phase 1 of the GSMA Video Share service.
For a more detailed description of the full GSMA Video Share service, please see the Wikipedia entry for [[Video share|Video Share]].

The most basic form is typically connected to a classical circuit-switched (CS) telephone call.
While talking on the CS line the speaker can start in parallel a multimedia IMS session. The session is normally a video stream, with audio being optional (since there is an audio session already open on the CS domain). It is also possible to share photos or files.

Actually, P2P video sharing does not require a full IMS implementation. It could work with a pure IETF [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) infrastructure and simple HTTP Digest authentication.
However, mobile operators may want to use it without username/password provisioning and the related frauds problems. One possible solution is the Early IMS Authentication method.
In the future USIM/ISIM based authentication could be introduced, too.
So the IMS adds up extra security and management features that are normally required by a mobile operator by default.

== Early implementation by Nokia ==

The early Nokia implementation requires the manual setting of an attribute in the phone book. When the video session is triggered (by simply pulling down the back-side camera cover on a 6680), the video sharing client looks up the destination URI based on the MSISDN number of the B party of the current open CS voice call. The video sharing is possible only if this number has a valid entry in the phone book and a valid URI for the SIP call.

However, this method is not really scalable, since the user has to enter very complex strings into the phone book manually. Because this service does not involve any application server, it is difficult to make a good business model for it.
Usually, the first commercial services were based on the idea that video sharing will increase the length of the voice sessions, and the resulting increased revenue would be enough to cover the costs of the video sharing service.

== History ==
The P2P video sharing was introduced in 2004 by Nokia. Two major operators started commercial implementations: "Turbo Call" &lt;ref name="Turbo Call"&gt;[http://www.tim.it/consumer/c366/i56102/o683_684/servizio.do http://www.tim.it/consumer/c366/i56102/o683_684/servizio.do] Service description at TIM (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Telecom Italia Mobile]] (TIM) in Italy and [[Telecomunicações Móveis Nacionais, SA]] (TMN) in Portugal.

The first handsets to support P2P video sharing were the Nokia 6630 and 6680. The 6680 is especially suited for turning on the video sharing by having a slider on top of the back-side camera.
Later the Nokia N70 was added to the commercially supported handsets.

== Popularity ==
TIM Italy reported about 10% penetration (based on the potentially available customers with appropriate handsets).

== Supported handsets ==
* Nokia 6630, 6680
* Nokia N70
*Nokia 5230

'''Redshift''' is a techno-economic theory suggesting hypersegmentation{{Clarify|date=June 2011}} of [[information technology]] markets based on whether individual computing needs are over or under-served by [[Moore's law]], which predicts the doubling of computing transistors (and therefore roughly computing power) every two years.  The theory,
proposed and named by [[New Enterprise Associates]] partner and former [[Sun Microsystems]] CTO [[Greg Papadopoulos]], categorized a series of high growth markets (redshifting) while predicting slower GDP-driven growth in traditional computing markets (blueshifting). Papadopoulos predicted the result will be a fundamental redesign of components comprising computing systems.

==Hypergrowth market segments (redshifting)==
According to the Redshift theory, applications "redshift" when they grow dramatically faster than Moore's Law allows, growing quickly in their absolute number of systems.&lt;ref name="gregspeech"&gt;Greg Papadopoulos: Sun Analyst Summit 2007, http://sun.feedroom.com/linking/?skin=oneclip&amp;fr_story=FEEDROOM178646&amp;hl=false&lt;/ref&gt;  In these markets, customers are running out of datacenter real-estate, power and cooling infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, June 14, 2006: https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/14/technology/14search.html?ex=1307937600&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Dell]] Senior Vice President Brad Anderson, “Businesses requiring [[hyperscale]] computing environments – where infrastructure deployments are measured by up to millions of servers, storage and networking equipment – are changing the way they approach IT.”&lt;ref&gt;Dell Press Release: http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2007/2007_03_27_rr_000?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=corp&lt;/ref&gt;

While various Redshift proponents offer minor alterations on the original presentation, “Redshifting” generally includes:&lt;ref name="gregspeech"/&gt;

=== ΣBW (Sum-of-[[Bandwidth (computing)|Bandwidth]]) ===
These are companies that drive heavy [[Internet]] traffic.  This includes popular web-portals like [[Google]], [[Yahoo]], [[AOL]] and [[MSN]].  It also includes [[Telecommunications service provider|telecoms]], multimedia, television over IP, online games like [[World of Warcraft]] and others.{{which|date=November 2010}}  This segment has been enabled by widespread availability of high-bandwidth Internet connections to consumers through a [[DSL]] or [[cable modem]]. A simple way to understand this market is that for every [[byte]] of content served to a PC, mobile phone or other device over a network, there must exist computing systems to send it over the network.

=== [[High performance computing]] (HPC) ===
These are companies that do complex simulations that involve (for example) weather, stock markets or drug-design simulations.  This is a generally elastic market because businesses frequently spend every "available" dollar budgeted for IT. A common anecdote claims that cutting the cost of computing by half causes customers in this segment to buy at least twice as much, because each marginal IT dollar spent contributes to business advantage.

=== *prise (or "Star-prise") ===
These are companies that aggregate traditional computing applications and offer them as services, typically in the form of [[Software as a service|Software as a Service (SaaS)]].  For example, companies that deploy [[Customer relationship management|CRM]] are over-served by Moore's Law, but companies that aggregate CRM functions and offer them as a service, such as [[Salesforce.com]], grow faster than Moore's Law.

=== The eBay crisis ===
A prime example of redshift was a crisis at [[eBay]].  In 1999 eBay suffered a database crisis when a single [[Oracle Database]] running on the fastest [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] machine available (these tracking Moore's law in this period) was not enough to cope with eBay's growth.  The solution was to massively parallelise their system architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smoothspan.wordpress.com/2007/08/30/youve-already-had-a-multicore-crisis-and-just-didnt-realize-it/ You’ve Already Had a Multicore Crisis and Just Didn’t Realize It!] (Bob Warfield, ''SmoothSpan Blog'', 2007-08-30)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randy Shoup and Dan Pritchett. [http://www.addsimplicity.com/downloads/eBaySDForum2006-11-29.pdf "The eBay Architecture: Striking a balance between site stability, feature velocity, performance, and cost."] SD Forum 2006 proceedings, November 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional computing markets (blueshifting)==
Redshift theory suggests that traditional computing markets, such as those serving [[enterprise resource planning]] or [[customer relationship management]] applications, have reached relative saturation in industrialized nations.  Thereafter, proponents argued further market growth will closely follow [[gross domestic product]] growth, which typically remains under 10% for most countries annually. Given that Moore's Law continues to predict accurately the rate of computing transistor growth, which roughly translates into computing power doubling every two years, the Redshift theory suggests that traditional computing markets will ultimately contract as a percentage of computing expenditures over time.&lt;ref name="gregspeech"/&gt;

Functionally, this means “Blueshifting” customers can satisfy computing requirement growth by swapping in faster processors without increasing the absolute number of computing systems.

==Consequences and industry commentary==
Papadopoulos argued that while traditional computing markets remain the dominant source of revenue through the late 2000s, a shift to hypergrowth markets will inevitably occur.  When that shift occurs, he argued computing (but not computers) will become a utility, and differentiation in
the IT market will be based upon a company's ability to deliver computing at massive scale, efficiently and with predictable service levels, much like electricity at that time.&lt;ref name="gregspeech"/&gt;

If computing is to be delivered as a utility, [[Nicholas G. Carr|Nicholas Carr]] suggested Papadopoulos' vision compares with [[Microsoft]] researcher Jim Hamilton, who both agree that computing is most efficiently generated in [[shipping containers]]&lt;!-- Makes no sense --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Rough Type (Nicholas Carr's blog): http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/02/the_future_of_c.php and http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/03/showdown_in_the_1.php&lt;/ref&gt; Industry analysts are also beginning to quantify Redshifting and Blueshifting markets.  According to [[International Data Corporation]] vice president Matthew Eastwood, "IDC believes that the IT market is in a period of hyper segmentation... This a class of customers that is Moore's law driven and as price performance gains continue, IDC believes that these organizations will accelerate their consumption of IT infrastructure.”&lt;ref&gt;IDC Link: http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=lcUS20623507&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and nomenclature==
Key portions of Papadopoulos' theory were first presented by Sun Microsystems CEO [[Jonathan I. Schwartz|Jonathan Schwartz]] in late 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Sun Blackbox Press Conference: http://sun.feedroom.com/?skin=oneclip&amp;fr_story=73d774789da2b024c111f8cfc7948af6d1577827&amp;rf=bm&lt;/ref&gt; Papadopoulos later gave a full presentation on Redshift to Sun's annual Analyst Summit&lt;ref name="gregspeech"/&gt; in February 2007. The term [[Redshift]] refers to what happens when electromagnetic radiation, usually visible light, moves away from an observer.  Papadopoulos chose this term to reflect growth markets because redshift helped cosmologists explain the expansion of the universe.

Papadopoulos originally depicted traditional IT markets as green to represent their revenue base, but later changed them to “blueshift,” which occurs when a light source moves toward an observer, similar to what would happen during a contraction of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, April 12, 2007: http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9013563&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robot ethics''', sometimes known by the short expression "'''roboethics'''", concerns ethical problems that occur with robots, such as whether robots pose a threat to humans in the long or short run, whether some ''uses'' of robots are problematic (such as in healthcare or as '[[Lethal autonomous weapon|killer robots]]' in war), and how robots should be designed such as they act 'ethically' (this last concern is also called [[machine ethics]]). Robot ethics is a sub-field of ethics of technology, specifically information technology, and it has close links to legal as well as socio-economic concerns.  Researchers from diverse areas are beginning to tackle ethical questions about creating robotic technology and implementing it in societies, in a way that will still ensure the safety of the human race. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ieee-ras.org/robot-ethics|title=Robot Ethics|last=|first=|date=|website=IEEE Robotics and Automation Society|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the issues are as old as the word ''robot'', serious academic discussions started around the year 2000. Robot ethics requires the combined commitment of experts of several disciplines, who have to adjust laws and regulations to the problems resulting from the scientific and technological achievements in Robotics and AI. The main fields involved in robot ethics are: [[robotics]], [[computer science]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[philosophy]], [[ethics]], [[theology]], [[biology]], [[physiology]], [[cognitive science]], [[neuroscience]]s, [[law]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], and [[industrial design]].

==History and events==
{{See also|History of robots}}
{{Robotic laws}}
Since antiquity, the discussion of ethics in relation to the treatment of non-human and even non-living things and their potential "spirituality" have been discussed. With the development of machinery and eventually robots, this philosophy was also applied to robotics. The first publication directly addressing and setting the foundation for robot ethics was [[Runaround (story)]], a science fiction short story written by [[Isaac Asimov]] in 1942 which featured his well known [[Three Laws of Robotics]]. These three laws were continuously altered by Asimov, and a fourth, or zeroth law, was eventually added to precede the first three.  in the context of his [[science fiction]] works. The short term "roboethics" was probably coined by Gianmarco Veruggio.&lt;ref name=Tzafestas-2016&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tzafestas |first1=Spyros G. |title=Roboethics A Navigating Overview |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |location=Cham |isbn=978-3-319-21713-0 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important event that propelled the concern of roboethics was the First International Symposium on Roboethics in 2004 by the collaborative effort of Scuola di Robotica, the Arts Lab of Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, and the Theological Institute of Pontificia Accademia della Santa Croce, Rome. "After two days of intense debating, anthropologist Daniela Cerqui identified three main ethical positions emerging from two days of intense debate:
#Those who are not interested in ethics. They consider that their actions are strictly technical, and do not think they have a social or a moral responsibility in their work.
#Those who are interested in short-term ethical questions. According to this profile, questions are expressed in terms of “good” or “bad,” and refer to some cultural values. For instance, they feel that robots have to adhere to social conventions. This will include “respecting” and helping humans in diverse areas such as implementing laws or in helping elderly people. (Such considerations are important, but we have to remember that the values used to define the “bad” and the “good” are relative. They are the contemporary values of the industrialized countries).
#Those who think in terms of long-term ethical questions, about, for example, the “Digital divide” between South and North, or young and elderly. They are aware of the gap between industrialized and poor countries, and wonder whether the former should not change their way of developing robotics in order to be more useful to the South. They do not formulate explicitly the question what for, but we can consider that it is implicit".&lt;ref&gt; http://www.roboethics.org/icra2005/veruggio.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{main|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}
Roboethics as a science or philosophical topic has not made any strong cultural impact,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} but is a common theme in science fiction literature and films. One of the most popular films depicting the potential misuse of robotic and AI technology is ''[[The Matrix]]'', depicting a future where the lack of roboethics brought about the destruction of the human race. An animated film based on ''The Matrix'', the ''[[Animatrix]]'', focused heavily on the potential ethical issues between humans and robots. Many of the Animatrix's animated shorts are also named after Isaac Asimov's fictional stories. 

Although not a part of roboethics ''per se'', the ethical behavior of robots themselves has also been a joining issue in roboethics in popular culture. The ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'' series focuses on robots run by an uncontrolled AI program with no restraint on the termination of its enemies. This series too has the same futuristic plot as ''The Matrix'' series, where robots have taken control. The most famous case of robots or computers without programmed ethics is [[HAL 9000]] in the ''[[Space Odyssey]]'' series, where HAL (a computer with advance AI capabilities who monitors and assists humans on a space station) kills all the humans on board to ensure the success of the assigned mission after his own life is threatened.

==History==
The ''Australasia'' (Official number 106302) was built in 1884 in [[West Bay City, Michigan]] by the shipyard owned by Captain James Davidson. She was built for the Davidson Steamship Company which was also owned by Captain Davidson. At a length of {{convert|285|ft|m}} the ''Australasia'' was one of the [[List of longest wooden ships|largest wooden ships ever built]]; her beam was {{convert|39|ft|m}} wide and her cargo hold was {{convert|21.2|ft|m}} deep. She was powered by a [[Compound steam engine|fore and aft compound engine]] which was fueled by two coal burning [[Scotch marine boiler]]s. [[File:Australasia ship.png|thumb|left|Stern view of the ''Australasia'' at an ore dock]] She had a [[gross register tonnage]] of 1829.32 tons and a [[net register tonnage]] of 1539.20 tons.&lt;ref name="Great Lakes Vessel History"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.greatlakesvesselhistory.com/histories-by-name/a/australasia/ |title = Australasia |work = Great Lakes Vessel Histories of Sterling Berry |access-date = March 9, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 1884 the ''Australasia'' was launched as hull number #9.&lt;ref name="Wrecksite"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?159314 |title=SS Australasia (+1896) |work=Wrecksite |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Great Lakes Vessel History"/&gt; At the time of her launch the ''Australasia'' was the largest wooden hulled ship in the world.&lt;ref name="Wisconsin Shipwrecks"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wisconsinshipwrecks.org/Vessel/Details/47?region=Index |title = Service History |work = Wisconsin Shipwrecks |access-date = March 10, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of her enormous size the ''Australasia'' needed iron cross bracing, an iron [[keelson]], iron plates, and several iron arches to increase her strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/13000466.htm |title = National Register of Historic Places Program |publisher = National Park Service |access-date = March 10, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|James Davidson was a well-known builder of wooden ships. While most companies started to build ships with steel hulls, Davidson kept building wooden ships and pushed the boundaries of wooden boat technology. Because of this he eventually manufactured some of the largest wooden ships in the world like: the [[SS Appomattox|''Appomattox'']], the [[Frank O'Connor (bulk carrier)|''Frank O'Connor'']] and the [[Pretoria (ship)|''Pretoria'']]&lt;ref name="Davidson Shipbuilding"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wisconsinshipwrecks.org/vessel/Details/218 |title=Davidson Shipbuilding |work=Wisconsin Shipwrecks |accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

She was used to haul [[bulk cargo]]es such as [[iron ore]], [[coal]], [[grain]] and sometimes [[salt]]. She could carry these cargoes so efficiently that she earned a fortune for her owners at a time when small, less versatile wooden vessels were quickly being replaced by larger, and stronger iron or steel vessels.&lt;ref name="Wisconsin Shipwrecks"/&gt; Just like all ships owned by Captain Davidson, the ''Australasia'' used to tow a wooden schooner barge.&lt;ref name="Wisconsin Shipwrecks"/&gt;

==Final voyage==
On October 17, 1896, the ''Australasia'' was bound from [[Lake Erie]] to [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], carrying 2,200 tons of [[soft coal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://greatlakes.bgsu.edu/vessel/view/000453 |title = Australasia |publisher = Bowling Green State University |access-date = March 10, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 6:00 p.m. near [[Baileys Harbor (CDP), Wisconsin|Baileys Harbor]], the crew of the ''Australasia'' discovered "a fire beneath the [[Texas (steamboat)|texas]] on the main deck". They attempted to fight the blaze but failed. The crew abandoned the ''Australasia'' before she reached [[Jacksonport, Wisconsin]]. At 10:30 p.m., the ''Australasia'' was about four hours off Jacksonport when the [[tugboat]] ''John Leathem'' came upon the struggling steamer. The ''Leathem'' began towing the ''Australasia'' to shore, but the [[Hawser|hawser]] connecting them kept burning through. At 9:00 a.m. on October 18, 1896, the crew of the ''Leathem'' gave up trying to salvage her and instead dragged her onto the beach in {{convert|15|ft|m}} of water south of Cave Point.&lt;ref name="Final Voyage"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wisconsinshipwrecks.org/Vessel/Details/47?region=Index |title = Final Voyage |work = Wisconsin Shipwrecks |access-date = March 10, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her crew decided to scuttle her; they did this by ramming a hole in the ''Australasia''&amp;apos;s side with the ''Leathem''&amp;apos;s stem.&lt;ref name="Final Voyage"/&gt; She was left heading north by northwest. She burned until the night of October 18, 1896.&lt;ref name="Final Voyage"/&gt;

==The ''Australasia'' today==
[[File:Australasia (steamer).png|thumb|left|The ''Australasia'' in Fort William, Ontario]]
The ''Australasia'' was declared a total loss. Much of her cargo of soft coal and machinery was salvaged, however her hull was beyond repair and was abandoned.&lt;ref name="Today"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wisconsinshipwrecks.org/Vessel/Details/47?region=Index |title = Today |work = Wisconsin Shipwrecks |access-date = March 10, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today her lower hull lies mostly buried in sand 15 to 20 feet of water off [[Whitefish Dunes State Park]].&lt;ref name="nps.gov"/&gt; Because most of her hull remains buried in sand, there is the possibility that different hull sections may be uncovered which may reveal more significant information about her construction.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"/&gt; Not a trace of her cargo is visible on the site of her wreck, but traces of coal is visible on a beach nearby.&lt;ref name="Today"/&gt; The wreck of the ''Australasia'' is rarely visited by divers which means that very little site disturbance to the site has occurred.&lt;ref name="Today"/&gt; Close by are the wrecks of several other ships including the early steel freighter [[SS Lakeland|''Lakeland'']], the large wooden bulk carrier [[Frank O'Connor (bulk carrier)|''Frank O'Connor]], the wooden steamer [[SS Louisiana|''Louisiana'']] which was lost during the [[Great Lakes Storm of 1913]], the schooner [[Christina Nilsson (shipwreck)|''Christina Nilsson'']] and the steamboat [[Joys (shipwreck)|''Joys'']].

'''Silicon Taiga''' is a [[nickname]] for [[Akademgorodok]], a [[Russia]]n research and development center that is located near [[Novosibirsk]]. The nickname is a reference to the [[Silicon Valley]], a renowned IT region found in [[Northern California]]. The term was first introduced to the Western press by [[Newsweek|Newsweek magazine]]&lt;ref&gt;Newsweek magazine, [http://www.newsweek.com/1999/05/02/better-spell-it-cyberia.html First mention of Silicon Taiga in press], May 03, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; in 1999.

== Location ==

The town is situated partly on the [[Ob River|River Ob]], and partly on the shore of a [[Novosibirsk reservoir|Novosibirsk artificial reservoir]] that was created by a [[dam]] on the river. Informally, this reservoir is called the [[Ob Sea]]. The dam contains a large [[hydroelectric power plant]] that was constructed in the 1950s.

The town itself has no skyscrapers, and only one remote speedway connecting it to the city of Novosibirsk. Office buildings and residences are connected by many intertwined, footworn paths.

==History==
In the 1950s the former [[Academy of Sciences of the USSR]] founded its Siberian Division, today known as the [[Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences]], with a center of [[scientific research]] in Akademgorodok, where they established a dozen research institutes. To keep institutes supplied with fresh minds, [[Novosibirsk State University]] (NSU) was founded by the resolution of the [[Council of Ministers of the USSR]] on January 9, 1958.

===Distinctive===
The distinctive feature of NSU is its system of competitive selection and its training of talented youth. NSU is the only university in Siberia to have developed a multilevel model of continuing education. The University was built and developed simultaneously with the Novosibirsk scientific center and is focused on training highly qualified specialists for scientific work and tutoring. Since its foundation in 1958, more than fifty thousand specialists graduated&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topuniversities.com/university/463/novosibirsk-state-university NSU on QS World University Rankings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201141934/http://topuniversities.com/university/463/novosibirsk-state-university |date=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from Novosibirsk State University; more than six thousand have defended their [[PhD]] dissertations, and over one thousand five hundred have received [[doctor of science|doctoral degrees]]. In 2009, NSU achieved the status of a national research university. This high honor was granted by the [[Russian Government]] on a competitive basis for a period of ten years.

===Information Technology Outsourcing===
The first [[Information Technology Outsourcing|IT]] companies were established in Akademgorodok in the 1990s. After the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], the government's investments into scientific activity were greatly reduced, and many scientists left long established institutions on a quest for better conditions. Some of these scientists decided to leave Russia in search of jobs in foreign scientific organizations all over the world. Others established their own [[private business]]es, which were [[software]]-related [[High tech|high-tech]] IT companies. Many of these companies grew up into large, internationally recommended providers of software products and services. Their strategy was simple: the new IT companies would adopt the tried and true principles of the already established, famous IT corporations.

All IT companies in the Silicon Taiga can be divided into the two categories according to the [[offshore programming]] [[business model]] they employ: The firms that provide [[Offshore Development Center]] (ODC), and mostly develop new custom products ([[New product development|NPD]]), and the firms that are oriented to the [[Software as a service|SAAS]] model. Meantime the global giants in the field of software and high-tech products, such as [[IBM]], [[Intel Corporation]], and [[Schlumberger]], saw this growing trend and established [[branch office]]s in the Silicon Taiga.

===Innovative technology park===
The summer of 2010 saw the launch of an innovative technology park&lt;ref&gt;[http://marchmontnews.com/story.php?story_id=9924&amp;story=Novosibirsk%92s-Akademgorodok-eyes-$5m-nano-center Novosibirsk’s Akademgorodok eyes $5m nano-center]&lt;/ref&gt; in Akademgorodok, which brought together economic and intellectual power in the area, thus expanding innovation in Russia. Today, the Silicon Taiga is not just a collection of IT companies; it is a beneficial environment, in which the Russian national system of innovations can continue to flourish.&lt;ref name="Venture investment"&gt;{{cite web|author=Marya Smorgonskaya|url=http://www.marchmontnews.com/journals/viewJournal.php?articleId=233|title=Novosibirsk Modern Technologies Venture investment|work=MarchmontNews.com|publisher=Marchmont}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The Industries of the Future by Senior Policy Advisor [[Alec Ross (government official)|Alec Ross]] explores the geopolitical, cultural and generational changes that will be driven by the key industries over the next twenty years. Ross is a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at [[Johns Hopkins University]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alecross.com/about/|title=Alec Ross - Leading Expert on Innovation|website=Alec Ross {{!}} Technology Policy Expert, Innovator and Author|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the Senior Advisor for Innovation to [[Hillary Clinton|Secretary of State Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Talks at Google|title=Alec Ross: "The Industries of the Future" {{!}} Talks at Google|date=2016-04-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMmM2Jtkhxc|accessdate=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time as Senior Advisor for Innovation he visited forty-one countries looking at the technological advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wnyc.org/story/global-economy-come/?hootPostID=d6814599a4be899c06782c2a3f764f5e|title=A Road Map for the Future|website=WNYC|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a guest lecturer at a number of institutions including the [[United Nations]], [[University of Oxford]], [[Harvard Law School]], and [[Stanford Graduate School of Business|Stanford Business School]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ross started his career as a teacher through Teach for America and in 2000 he co-founded a technology-focused nonprofit organization called [[One Economy Corporation|One Economy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The book explores several industries including robotics, genetics, coding and big data. Ross explores how advances in robotics and life sciences will change the way we live—robots, artificial intelligence and machine learning will have impact on our lives. According to Ross, dramatic advances in life sciences will increase our life expectancy—but not all will benefit from such changes. Ross spends time exploring "Code" and how the codefication of money and also weapons (computer security) will both benefit and potentially disrupt our international economies. Ross also looks at how data will be "the raw material of the information age."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Industries of the Future|last=Ross|first=Alec|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2016|isbn=9781476753652|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ross also focuses on globalization and geopolitical economics. He explores how competitiveness and how societies, families and individuals will need to thrive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Ross gives attention to the importance of women stating that "the states and societies that do the most for women are those that will be best positioned to compete and succeed in the industries of the future."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The book also touches on how to prepare children for "success in a world of increasing change and competition."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Ross discusses the shift of robotics from being manual and repetitive to cognitive and non-repetitive.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://searchcio.techtarget.com/feature/Alec-Ross-on-how-cognitive-robots-will-change-the-world|title=Alec Ross on how cognitive robots will change the world|website=SearchCIO|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that breakthroughs in [[mathematical model]]ing and [[cloud robotics]] ([[machine learning]] and [[Artificial intelligence|Artificial Intelligence]]) make robotics acceptable.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the book Ross describes how other cultures have different reactions to robotics and he uses Japan's use of robotics in elder-care as an example.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He also expects that less developed countries may be able to leapfrog technologies in robotics much like they did with cell and mobile technologies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to Ross, the last trillion dollar industry was created out of computer code; the next trillion dollar industry will be created out of genome code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2016/02/16/exp-gps-0214-alec-ross-interview.cnn|title=Ross on the future of work - CNN Video|website=CNN|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dawn-nakagawa/alec-ross--genetic-code_b_9146928.html|title=The Next Trillion-Dollar Industry Could Be Built on Genetic Code|date=2016-02-04|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book Ross describes how [[genome]] code is already being used to fix humans from curing [[cancer]] to hacking the brain to growing organs. He also describes the difference between the [[United States]] investment in genome research with that of [[China]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Ross then turns to the "code-ification" of money, markets and trust. He describes the transition from cash to mobile and online banking. He also discusses the sharing economy from eBay to AirBnB and then gives an overview of BitCoin and blockchain technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ross also focuses on [[Computer security|cybersecurity]] and the weaponization of code with a focus on a move from cold war to "code war." Ross states that he expects the total market size of the cyberindustry to reach $175 billion by the end of 2017.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Development history ==
Alec Ross has said that he intended to give a balanced point of view with the book that it is neither a [[Utopia]]n or [[Dystopia]]n vision of the future which is why he opened the book with the struggles he witnessed growing up in West Virginia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On writing the book Ross said that he knows his parents would have wanted a book like this in the sixties that would describe what globalization would do and he wished that he had a book like this when he graduated from college that would have explored the Internet and digitization on the economy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The editors for the book were Jonathan Karp and Jonathan Cox of [[Simon &amp; Schuster]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Reviews and reception ==
''The Industries of the Future'' has received mainly positive reviews from the likes of ''[[Forbes]]'', ''New York Journal of Books'', and ''[[Financial Times]]''. ''Forbes'' contributor Peter Decherney said the book "reads like a portable [[TED (conference)|TED conference]] at which you've been seated next to the smartest guy in the room."&lt;ref name="Decherney"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterdecherney/2016/01/30/a-bad-time-to-be-a-control-freak-alec-ross-forecasts-the-industries-of-the-future/#575ae045209c|title=Searching for the Next Silicon Valley: Alec Ross Forecasts the Industries of the Future|last=Decherney|first=Peter|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was also listed on the Forbes list—''16 New Books for Leaders to Begin in 2016''.&lt;ref name="Decherney"/&gt; [[Tara Sonenshine|Tara D. Sonenshine]] in the ''New York Journal of Books'' called the book a good place to start "if you want to know how to survive and thrive in the fast-paced world of today and how to anticipate the opportunities  of tomorrow's information age." Sonenshine also called out the book for focusing on women and multiculturalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/book-review/industries-future|title=a book review by Tara Sonenshine: The Industries of the Future|website=www.nyjournalofbooks.com|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article titled "Is predicting the future futile or necessary?" by Stephen Cave in the ''Financial Times'' is more critical, saying that Ross focuses on industries with already considerable coverage and investment but Cave points out that "rarely can the future be predicted by extending current trajectories."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/5815c14a-b2e7-11e5-b147-e5e5bba42e51.html|title=Is predicting the future futile or necessary?|last=Cave|first=Stephen|date=2016-01-08|newspaper=Financial Times|issn=0307-1766|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''user guide''' or '''user's guide''', also commonly known as a '''manual''', is a [[technical communication]] [[document]] intended to give assistance to people using a particular system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Online Technical Writing: User Guides |url=http://www.prismnet.com/~hcexres/textbook/user_guides.html |date= |work= |publisher=hcexres@io.com |accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually written by a [[technical writer]], although user guides are written by programmers, product or project managers, or other technical staff, particularly in smaller companies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Blake]] and [[Robert W. Bly]], ''The Elements of Technical Writing'', pg. 143. [[New York City|New York]]: [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]], 1993. {{ISBN|0020130856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

User guides are most commonly associated with electronic goods, [[computer hardware]] and [[computer software|software]], although they can be written for any product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://manualsbrain.com/en/|title=Manuals Brain - all useful manuals at one place!|website=manualsbrain.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most user guides contain both a written guide and the associated images.  In the case of computer applications, it is usual to include [[screenshot]]s of the human-machine interface(s), and hardware manuals often include clear, simplified [[diagram]]s.  The language used is matched to the intended [[audience]], with [[jargon]] kept to a minimum or explained thoroughly.

==Contents of a user manual==
The sections of a user manual often include:
*A cover page
*A title page and copyright page
*A preface, containing details of related documents and information on how to navigate the user guide
*A contents page
*A guide on how to use at least the main function of the system
*A [[troubleshooting]] section detailing possible errors or problems that may occur, along with how to fix them
*A [[FAQ]] (Frequently Asked Questions)
*Where to find further help, and contact details 
*A [[glossary]] and, for larger documents, an [[index (publishing)|index]]

== History ==
[[File:Antikythera mechanism clockface, 1st-2nd century BC, Greece (model).jpg|thumb|The user guide engraved into a model of the Antikythera Mechanism.]]
User guides have been found with ancient devices. One example is the [[Antikythera mechanism|Antikythera Mechanism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/06/15/antikythera_mechanism_inscriptions_deciphered/|title=Boffins decipher manual for 2,000-year-old Ancient Greek computer|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a 2,000 year old Greek analogue computer that was found off the coast of the Greek island [[Antikythera]] in the year 1900. On the cover of this device are passages of text which describe the features and operation of the mechanism.

As the software industry was developing, the question of how to best document software programs was undecided. This was a unique problem for software developers, since users often became frustrated with current help documents&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chafin|first=Roy|date=January 1982|title=User Manuals: What Does the User Really Need?|url=|journal=SIGDOC '82 Proceedings of the 1st annual international conference on systems documentation|volume=|pages=36-39|via=ACM Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Some considerations for writing a user guide that developed at this time include:

* the use of [[plain language]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* length and reading difficulty&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* the role of printed user guides for digital programs&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKee|first=John|date=August 1986|title=Computer User Manuals in Print: Do They Have a Future?|url=|journal=ACM SIGDOC Asterisk Journal of Computer Documentation|volume=12|pages=11-16|via=ACM Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* user-centered design&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Computer software manuals and guides==
User manuals and user guides for most non-trivial [[software application]]s are book-like documents with contents similar to the above list. They may be distributed either in print or electronically. Some documents have a more fluid structure with many internal links. The ''[[Google Earth]] User Guide''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google Earth User Guide |url=http://earth.google.com/userguide/v4/ |date=4 June 2009 |work= |publisher=Google |accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of this format. The term ''guide'' is often applied to a document that addresses a specific aspect of a software product. Some usages are ''[[Installation (computer programs)|Installation]] Guide'', ''Getting Started Guide'', and various ''[[How to]]'' guides. An example is the ''[[Picasa]] Getting Started Guide''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Getting Started with Picasa: Getting Started Guide |url=http://picasa.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=93183 |date=15 June 2009 |work= |publisher=Google |accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[business software]] applications, where groups of users have access to only a sub-set of the application's full functionality, a user guide may be prepared for each group. An example of this approach is the ''[[Autodesk]] Topobase 2010 [[Online help|Help]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Autodesk Topobase 2010 Help |url=http://docs.autodesk.com/TOPOBSCLNT/2010/ENU/Autodesk%20Topobase%202010%20User%20Documentation/index.html?url=WSfacf1429558a55de9af080101d7e8b304-7c61.htm,topicNumber=d0e342 |date= |work= |publisher=Autodesk|accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; document, which contains separate ''[[System administrator|Administrator]] Guides'', ''[[User (computing)|User]] Guides'', and a ''[[Software developer|Developer's]] Guide''.

The '''Virtual Machine Queue''' ('''VMQ''') is a [[hardware virtualization]] technology for the efficient transfer of [[network packet|network traffic]] (such as [[TCP/IP]], [[iSCSI]] or [[FCoE]]) to a virtualized host OS.  VMQ technology was patented in 2010 by Daniel Baumberger of [[Intel]] Corp. A VMQ capable [[network interface controller|NIC]] can use [[direct memory access|DMA]] to transfer all incoming frames that should be routed to a receive queue to the receive buffers that are allocated for that queue. The miniport driver can indicate all of the frames that are in a receive queue in one receive indication call.

The VMQ interface supports:

* Classification of received packets in NIC hardware by using the destination [[MAC address]] to route the packets to different receive queues.
* NIC ability to use DMA to transfer packets directly to a virtual machine’s shared memory. For more information about shared memory, see NDIS 6.20 Memory Management Interface.
* Scaling to multiple processors by processing packets for different virtual machines on different processors.

== Virtual Machine Queue Architecture ==

The [[Network Driver Interface Specification|NDIS]] virtual machine queue (VMQ) architecture provides advantages for virtualization such as:

* Virtualization impacts performance and VMQ helps overcome those effects.
* VMQ supports live migration.
* VMQ co-exists with NDIS task offloads and other optimizations.

== Critiques ==
Some networks recommend disabling VMQ. They state this option is prone to misconfiguration and can cause reduced network performance when enabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disable Virtual Machine Queues|url=https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/documentation/80/virtualization/virtualization/set-up-the-vm-series-firewall-on-hyper-v/install-the-vm-series-firewall-on-hyper-v/performance-tuning-of-the-vm-series-firewall-on-hyper-v/disable-virtual-machine-queues.html?PageSpeed=noscript|publisher=Palo Alto Networks, Inc|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Whiteboard animation''' is the process of which an author physically draws and records an illustrated story using a [[whiteboard]]- or whiteboard like surface- and [[Marker pen|marker pens]]. The animations frequently are aided with narration by script. The authors commonly use [[stop motion]] animation to liven hand drawn illustrations, with [[YouTube]] used as a common platform. It is also used in television and internet advertisements to communicate to consumer's in a personal way. The earliest videos made using Whiteboard Animation were published in 2009 on [[YouTube]], used mostly for experimental purposes until developing into a story telling device, focusing majority on narratives, though it has many other uses in modern day. 

== Description ==

"Whiteboard animation" refers to a specific type of presentation that uses the process of creating a series of draw pictures on a [[whiteboard]] that are recorded in sequence and then played back to create an [[animated]] presentation. The actual effect of whiteboard animation is time-lapse, or stop-motion. Actual sequential frame by frame animation is rarely used but has been incorporated. Other terms are "video scribing" and "animated doodling". These video animation styles are now seen in many variations, and have taken a turn into many other animation styles. With the introduction of [[software]] to create the whiteboard animations, the process has many different manifestations of varying quality. Those who use whiteboard animation are typically businesses and educators.

== Process ==
The whiteboard animation production procedure begins with creating a topic. Once the topic is chosen, script writing begins. After the content is created, it is time to create rough drafts of animations. These assist to set up the inventive bearing and timing for the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whiteboardanimation.com/process|title=Getting Started with Your Whiteboard Animation Production Process {{!}} Whiteboard Animation|last=Studio|first=Whiteboard Animation|website=www.whiteboardanimation.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the process is as follows:
# Compose the content
# Record the voiceover
# Make starting animations
# Organize the animations
# Make Guides
# Record the video
# Match up sound and video
# Include music
# Fare and Share&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://uxmastery.com/how-to-create-a-budget-whiteboard-animation/|title=How To Create A Budget Whiteboard Animation|date=2013-10-08|work=UX Mastery|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The steps listed above are not set in stone, they should be used as a guideline to create a whiteboard animation production.

== Applications ==

Whiteboard animation has been used in a few TV spots and on internet video sites such as [[YouTube]] and [[Vimeo]]. Early types were UPS Whiteboard Commercials. Many companies and firms of all sectors and sizes are incorporating this style into their modus operandi to teach company employees different company policies or demonstrate a new software or product to consumers.

For educational purposes, whiteboard animation videos have been used for learning online to teach languages, as chapter summaries for educational textbooks, and for the public communication of academic scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thon|first1=Jonathan N.|last2=Kitterman|first2=Alice C.|last3=Italiano Jr.|first3=Joseph E.|title=Animating platelet production adds physiological context|journal=Trends in Molecular Medicine|date=2013|volume=19|issue=10|pages=583–585|doi=10.1016/j.molmed.2013.07.010|pmid=23953478|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471491413001317|accessdate=4 April 2018|pmc=4418476}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study of whiteboard animation found that, despite claims and high popularity, there is little to no compelling experimental evidence that they are more effective in learning, motivation, or persuasion than other forms of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Türkay|first1=Selen|title=The effects of whiteboard animations on retention and subjective experiences when learning advanced physics topics|journal=Computers &amp; Education|date=2016|volume=98|pages=102–114|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2016.03.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131516300550|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2010, the [[Royal Society of Arts]] converted selected speeches and books from its public events program into whiteboard animations. The first 14 [[RSA Animate]] videos gained 46 million views in 2011, making the RSA's YouTube channel the no.1 nonprofit channel worldwide.&lt;ref&gt; Halliday, Josh (21 October 2011), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/oct/21/internet-users-animated-rsa-films "Internet users get animated about RSA short film series"], ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;
