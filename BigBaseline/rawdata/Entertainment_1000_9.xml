'''''A Prairie Home Companion''''' is a weekly radio [[variety show]] created and hosted by [[Garrison Keillor]] that aired live from 1974 to 2016. In 2016, musician [[Chris Thile]] took over as host, and the successor show was eventually renamed ''[[Live from Here]]''. ''A Prairie Home Companion'' aired on Saturdays from the [[Fitzgerald Theater]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]; it was also frequently heard on tours to [[New York City]] and other U.S. cities. The show is known for its musical guests, especially [[Folk music|folk]] and traditional musicians, tongue-in-cheek radio drama, and relaxed humor. Keillor's wry storytelling segment, "[[Lake Wobegon|News from Lake Wobegon]]", was the show's best-known feature during his long tenure.

Distributed by [[Minnesota Public Radio]]'s distribution arm, [[American Public Media]], ''A Prairie Home Companion'' was heard on 690 [[public radio]] stations in the United States at its peak in spring{{Date needed|date=April 2018}} 2015 and reached an audience of four million U.S. listeners each week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.twincities.com/2017/12/06/whats-next-after-end-of-decades-long-keillor-mpr-relationship/|title=What’s next after end of decades-long Keillor-MPR relationship?|date=2017-12-06|work=Twin Cities|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show borrowed its name from a radio program in existence in 1969 that was named after the [[Prairie Home Cemetery]] near [[Concordia College, Moorhead|Concordia College]], in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/features/hodgepodge/25anniversary/list/c_cemetery.html| title=PHC 25th anniversary website| accessdate=December 15, 2009| website=prairiehome.publicradio.org}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It inspired a 2006 [[A Prairie Home Companion (film)|film of the same name]], written by Keillor, directed by [[Robert Altman]], and featuring Keillor, [[Kevin Kline]], [[Lily Tomlin]], [[Meryl Streep]], and [[Lindsay Lohan]].

==History==
=== Origin ===
The Saturday-evening show was a partial spin-off of ''A Prairie Home Morning Show'' with Keillor and [[Tom Keith]], which ran from 6 to 9&amp;nbsp;a.m. on [[Minnesota Public Radio]] and was continued by Keith and Dale Connelly for many years as ''[[The Morning Show (Minnesota Public Radio)|The Morning Show.]]''

After researching the [[Grand Ole Opry]] for an article, Keillor became interested in doing a variety show on the radio. On July 6, 1974, the first live broadcast of ''A Prairie Home Companion'' took place. That show was broadcast from St. Paul in the Janet Wallace Auditorium of [[Macalester College]]. Twelve audience members turned out, mostly children. The second episode featured the first performance on the show by [[Butch Thompson]], who became house pianist. Thompson stayed with the program until 1986 and still frequently performs on the show.

In 1978, the show moved into the World Theater in St. Paul, which Minnesota Public Radio purchased and renovated in 1986 and renamed the [[Fitzgerald Theater]] in 1994. This is the same venue the program uses today.

=== Hiatus ===
The show went off the air in 1987, with a "final performance" on June 13, and Keillor married and spent some time abroad during the following two years. For a brief time, the show was replaced—both on the air and in the World Theater—by ''[[Good Evening (radio program)|Good Evening]]'', hosted by [[Noah Adams]], a live variety show designed by ex-''Prairie Home'' and ''[[All Things Considered]]'' staffers to retain the audience Keillor had cultivated over the years. However, many stations opted instead to continue ''APHC'' repeats in its traditional Saturday time slot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Bowermaster| first=Jon| title=Fresh Voices Hope to Be Far From Wobegon| newspaper=The New York Times| date=December 13, 1987 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/13/arts/television-fresh-voices-hope-to-be-far-from-wobegon.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Keillor returned to radio with ''The American Radio Company of the Air'' (renamed ''Garrison Keillor's American Radio Company'' in its second season), broadcast originally from the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]]. The new program featured a broadly similar format to ''A Prairie Home Companion'', with sketches and musical guests reflecting a more New York sensibility, rather than the country and folk music predominant in ''APHC''. Also, while Keillor sang and delivered a regular monologue on ''American Radio Company'', Lake Wobegon was initially downplayed, as he felt it was "cruel" to talk to a [[Brooklyn, NY|Brooklyn]] audience about life in a small town. During this period, Keillor revived the full ''APHC'' format only for "annual farewell performances". In the fall of 1992, Keillor returned to the World Theater with ''ARC'' for the majority of the season, with Lake Wobegon and other ''APHC'' elements gradually but unmistakably returning to prominence.
=== Return and final years ===
[[File:2011APHC.jpg|thumb|''A Prairie Home Companion'' at the 2011 Minnesota State Fair]]
The following year, on October 2, 1993, the program officially reverted to the ''A Prairie Home Companion'' name and format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Songer| first=Marcia| title=Garrison Keillor: A Critical Companion| publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group| year=2000| pages=9–10| isbn=0-313-30230-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many of the episodes originated from St. Paul, the show often traveled to other cities around the U.S. and overseas for its live weekly broadcasts. Common road venues included [[The Town Hall]] in New York City; [[Tanglewood]] in [[Lenox, Massachusetts]]; [[Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts]] in [[Vienna, Virginia]]; [[Ryman Auditorium]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]; the [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theater]] in Los Angeles; and the State Theater in [[Minneapolis]]. It also broadcast a show each year from the [[Minnesota State Fair]].

The show was originally distributed nationally by Minnesota Public Radio in association with [[Public Radio International]]. Later, its distributor was Minnesota Public Radio's distribution unit, [[American Public Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Listening Information {{!}} A Prairie Home Companion| url=https://www.prairiehome.org/listen/| website=www.prairiehome.org| accessdate=2 December 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202234731/https://www.prairiehome.org/listen/| archive-date=December 2, 2016| dead-url=yes| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guest hosts===
[[File:2016-01-30ChrisThileAPHC.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Thile as guest host in 2016]]
Singer [[Sara Watkins]] of San Diego, California hosted the January 15, 2011, broadcast. The format was the same, but Keillor appeared only as a guest actor and to deliver the News from Lake Wobegon. He claimed he had taken the chance to see the show being performed for himself. It was reported that this could be the beginning of a trend toward Keillor's eventual retirement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/columns/state-of-the-arts/archive/2011/01/the-news-from-lake-woebegon-more-guest-hosts-likely.shtml |title=The news from Lake Wobegon: more guest hosts likely &amp;#124; State of the Arts |publisher=Minnesota Public Radio News |date=2011-01-15 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on March 16, 2011, Keillor stated in an interview with the [[AARP]] that he would most likely retire from the show by the time he turned 70 in August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Carol (2011-03-16). [http://www.aarp.org/politics-society/newsmakers/info-03-2011/garrison-keillor-announces-retirement.html Garrison Keillor Announces Retirement]. ''AARP Bulletin''. Retrieved March 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 29, 2011, [[Erica Rhodes]] expressed frustration over not being picked to guest host.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In September 2011, Keillor told ''[[The Tuscaloosa News]]'' that his last broadcast would be recorded in "early July 2013", and that instead of a permanent replacement host, there will be "a whole group of people. A rotation of hosts",&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, Mark Hughes (2011-09-09). [http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20110909/NEWS/110909751/-1/entertainment?p=5&amp;tc=pg 'Prairie Home Companion' tour comes to the Amp]. ''[[The Tuscaloosa News]]''. Page 5 of 5. Retrieved September 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; but in December 2011 Keillor said he had changed his mind and reconsidered his plans to retire because he still enjoyed hosting the show.

On February 7 and 14, 2015, mandolinist [[Chris Thile]] hosted the show (like Sara Watkins, a member of [[Nickel Creek]]). As when Watkins hosted, the format remained largely unchanged, but Keillor did not make an appearance. Instead, storyteller [[Tristan Jimerson]] appeared on the February 7 show and comedian/storyteller [[Elna Baker]] on the February 14 show. Thile's band [[Punch Brothers]] performed on the February 7 show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Seel |first1=Steve |title=Musician Chris Thile subs for Keillor on APHC |url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2015/02/07/thile |publisher=Minnesota Public Radio News |date=February 7, 2015 |accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thile was named permanent host of the show in late June 2015. Keillor's last show as host was recorded on July 1, 2016, and broadcast the following day. Thile took over as permanent host on October 15, 2016.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |title=Garrison Keillor hosts final A Prairie Home Companion episode |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/02/garrison-keillor-final-prairie-home-companion-episode |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=July 2, 2016 |access-date=January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charlton, Lauretta.

[[Barack Obama]] recorded a telephone call into the show, which ran on the Saturday broadcast,&lt;ref name="APguardian160702" /&gt; and Keillor performed his last "Lives of the Cowboys" sketch as regular host,&lt;ref name="APguardian160702" /&gt; with regulars Scott, Russell, and Newman, and including a series of duets with the guests Masse, O'Donovan, Jarosz, DiGiallonardo, &lt;!--RD?,--&gt;and Watkins.&lt;ref name="prairiehome160702b"&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.prairiehome.org/story/2016/07/02/script-the-lives-of-the-cowboys-july-2-2016 | title= Script: The Lives of the Cowboys, July 2, 2016 | author= Keillor, Garrison, et al. | date= July 2, 2016 | website= PrairieHome.org | access-date= December 1, 2016 | quote=  | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170102081735/https://www.prairiehome.org/story/2016/07/02/script-the-lives-of-the-cowboys-july-2-2016 | archive-date= January 2, 2017 | dead-url= yes | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, he performed his last "News from Lake Wobegon" segment, with its final closing description of the fictional town, where “all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average.”&lt;ref name="APguardian160702" /&gt; Thile made his debut as permanent host on October 15, 2016.

===Name change===
On November 29, 2017, Minnesota Public Radio terminated its contract with Keillor because of "allegations of his inappropriate behavior with an individual who worked with him."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mpr.org/press/2017/11/29/statement-from-minnesota-public-radio-regarding-garrison-keillor-and-a-prairie-home-compa|title=Minnesota Public Radio|website=Minnesota Public Radio|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.startribune.com/garrison-keillor-reportedly-fired-for-improper-behavior/460802703/#11/ | title=Garrison Keillor reportedly fired for improper behavior| date=November 29, 2017| work=Minneapolis Star Tribune| first=Neal| last=Justin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.greensboro.com/go_triad/arts/garrison-keillor-fired-over-alleged-improper-behavior/article_4bee0e2a-5ca8-51f6-9ee4-47a9e7e48d6a.html| title=Garrison Keillor fired over alleged improper behavior| last=Baenen| first=Jeff| agency=[[Associated Press]]| work=[[News and Record]]| location=Greensboro, NC| date=29 November 2017| accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Keillor still owned artistic rights and the trademark to the show's name, MPR also announced that it would change the name,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/business/media/garrison-keillor-fired.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 29, 2017 | title=Minnesota Public Radio Fires Garrison Keillor Over Allegations of Improper Conduct| first=Maya| last=Salam}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was announced as ''[[Live from Here]]'' live on the December 16, 2017 broadcast of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livefromhere.org/about/history|title=Live from Here: A Brief History|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; MPR also announced it would cease distributing reruns of ''A Prairie Home Companion'' featuring Keillor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=https://www.mpr.org/press/2017/11/29/statement-from-minnesota-public-radio-regarding-garrison-keillor-and-a-prairie-home-compa| title=Statement from Minnesota Public Radio Regarding Garrison Keillor and A Prairie Home Companion| publisher=[[Minnesota Public Radio]]| accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keillor stated he had been "fired" from MPR, but he had technically not been employed by MPR / APM since 2002, working instead as an independent contractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/11/30/garrison-keillor-conduct-answered-unanswered-questions|title=Keillor's conduct: What we know and don't know|last=Staff|first=MPR News|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planned archive===

On April 13, 2018, Minnesota Public Radio posted a message stating its intent to reinstate the online archives of ''A Prairie Home Companion'' and ''The Writer's Almanac'': {{Quote|Minnesota Public Radio has reached an agreement with Garrison Keillor to restore free public access to the online archives of ''A Prairie Home Companion'' and ''The Writer’s Almanac''.  Later this month, past performances of these popular shows will be returned to their respective websites: [http://prairiehome.org/ prairiehome.org] and [http://writersalmanac.org/ writersalmanac.org]. MPR will pay $275,000 for Mr. Keillor’s rights related to these historic archives and to resolve all other matters.

“These archives feature the work of thousands of talented artists, poets and musicians,” said Jon McTaggart, president and CEO of Minnesota Public Radio and American Public Media Group. “We are pleased that these performances will once again be available to fans of these programs.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mpr.org/stories/2018/04/13/mpr-reaches-agreement-with-garrison-keillor-to-restore-public-access-to-online-archives "MPR Reaches Agreement with Garrison Keillor to Restore Public Access to Online Archives"], ''[[Minnesota Public Radio]]'', retrieved April 13, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Music is a main feature of the program; the show is a significant outlet for [[American folk music]] of many genres, especially [[country music|country]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[blues]], and [[Gospel music|gospel]], but it also has guest performers from a wide variety of other styles of music, including classical, opera, and music from a number of different countries. The country musician and former record company executive [[Chet Atkins]] has appeared on the show many times, as have singer-songwriters [[Mark Knopfler]] (lead guitarist and [[frontman]] of the bands [[Dire Straits]] and the [[Notting Hillbillies]]) and [[Jeff Lang]]. Folk/gospel duo [[Robin and Linda Williams]] have been regular guests since 1976, and often join Keillor and another female performer, often [[Jearlyn Steele]], to form "The Hopeful Gospel Quartet". [[Peter Ostroushko]], [[Greg Brown (folk musician)|Greg Brown]], [[Jean Redpath]], and [[Prudence Johnson]], among others, were recurring guests on the program between 1974 and 1987. The [[Wailin' Jennys]] and Andra Suchy are current recurring guests, and when the show travels, Keillor generally features local musicians and acts.

Greetings from members of the audience to friends and family at home (frequently humorous) are read each week by Keillor just after the show's [[intermission]], at the top of the second hour. Birthdays and anniversaries of famous composers and musicians are also observed.

===Features===
[[File:PrairieHomeCompanion2007RhubarbSisters.JPG|thumb|190px|The Rhubarb Sisters singing during taping of the show]]
Keillor and the ensemble performed comedy [[skits]]. Notable skits and characters often recur, such as the satirical "[[Guy Noir]], [[Private investigator|Private Eye]]", which parodied [[film noir]] and [[radio dramas]]. Guy Noir's popularity was such that the first few notes of the theme or the first lines of the announcer's introduction ("A dark night in a city that knows how to keep its secrets&amp;nbsp;...") often drew applause and cheers from the audience. Also regularly featured were the adventures of Dusty and Lefty, "The Lives of the Cowboys".

===News from Lake Wobegon===
One of the show's best-known features was Keillor's "News from Lake Wobegon", a weekly storytelling monologue, claiming to be a report from his fictitious hometown of [[Lake Wobegon]], "the little town that time forgot and the decades cannot improve&amp;nbsp;... where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average". The opening words of the [[monologue]] usually did not change: "Well, it's been a quiet week in Lake Wobegon, Minnesota, my hometown, out on the edge of the [[prairie]]." Keillor often poked fun at central Minnesota's large [[Scandinavian-American]] and [[German-American]] communities, and many of his fictional characters have names that reflect this. The "News from Lake Wobegon" did not have a set structure, but featured recurring characters and places such as the Chatterbox Café, the Sidetrack Tap, Pastor Ingqvist of the Lake Wobegon [[Lutheran Church]] and his successor Pastor Liz, Father Emil of Our Lady of Perpetual Responsibility Roman Catholic Church (a parody of [[Our Mother of Perpetual Help]]),{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} the Lake Wobegon [[Whippets]] sports teams, various members of the Bunsen and Krebsbach families, and an assortment of nearby "Norwegian bachelor farmers".{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Once a year the program featured a special "joke show", which generally included the Lake Wobegon monologue and musical acts, but with other skits replaced by the performers taking turns telling jokes. Humorists such as [[Paula Poundstone]] and [[Roy Blount Jr.]] often made guest appearances on those shows, and listeners and audience members were encouraged to submit jokes for use on the air.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

[[In-joke]]s are also sprinkled through the show, such as "Piscacadawadaquoddymoggin", a made-up word that's been used both for places and for people's names. The components of this made-up word are portions of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] place names in the New England region of the United States, most of them in Maine (i.e.: Piscataqua, Passamaquoddy, and Androscoggin).

===Fictional sponsors===
[[Image:PrairieHomeCompanionGuysShoes.JPG|thumb|right|A sign for "Guy's Shoes", one of ''A&amp;nbsp;Prairie Home Companion''{{'}}s fictitious sponsors.]]
The show creates fictional advertisements for fictional products, performed in the style of live old-time radio commercials. The show acknowledges its actual [[underwriting spot|underwriters]] at the beginning, end, and middle (break) of the show.

''Prairie Home''{{'}}s most prominent "sponsor" is the fictitious "Powdermilk Biscuits". Before he and the band performed the product's jingle every week ("Has your family tried 'em, Powdermilk?"), [[Garrison Keillor]] would extol Powdermilk's virtues in this way:

{{cquote|Heavens they're tasty, and expeditious. Give shy persons the strength they need to get up and do what needs to be done. Made from whole wheat raised by Norwegian bachelor farmers, so you know they're not only good for you, they're pure, mostly. Get 'em in the bright blue box with a picture of a biscuit on the front, or ready-made in the brown bag with the dark stains that indicate freshness.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{ cite book| last=Lee| first=Judith Yaross| year=1991| title=Garrison Keillor: A Voice of America| series=Studies in Popular Culture| pages=35, 85| location=Jackson, MS| publisher=University Press of Mississippi| isbn=978-1617033995 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UttaAAAAMAAJ| access-date=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Among its other "sponsors", Bebop-A-Reebop [[Rhubarb pie|Rhubarb Pie]] (and Frozen Rhubarb Pie Filling) has been prominent, with ads featuring the Bebop-A-Reebop jingle, performed to the tune of "[[Shortnin' Bread]]":{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}{{quote|One little thing can revive a guy&lt;br&gt; And that is a piece of rhubarb pie&lt;br&gt; Serve it up, nice and hot&lt;br&gt; Maybe things aren't as bad as you thought&lt;br&gt; Momma's little baby loves rhubarb, rhubarb&lt;br&gt; Bebopareebop rhubarb pie.&lt;ref name=RhubarbEx&gt;{{cite web | author = Keillor, Garrison, [[Tim Russell]], [[Sue Scott (actress)|Sue Scott]], and [[Fred Newman (actor)|Fred Newman]] | date = February 14, 2004 | title = Rhubarb [Segment;''A Prairie Home Companion, with Garrison Keillor''] | format=transcript| url=http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/2004/02/14/scripts/rhurbarb.shtml| location = Saint Paul, MN| publisher=American Public Media| access-date=November 30, 2016}} [Contributing performer/writer names for this program were inferred by a Wikipedia editor from initials appearing in this source, based on regular cast information appearing elsewhere.]&lt;/ref&gt;}} The jingle is usually sung after a bombastic, sound-effect-enhanced tale of woe, and is immediately followed by Keillor asking, "Wouldn't this be a great time for a piece of rhubarb pie? Yes, nothing gets the taste of shame and humiliation out of your mouth quite like Bebop-A-Reebop Rhubarb Pie."&lt;ref name=RhubarbEx/&gt;{{better source|date=December 2016}}

Other prominent "sponsors" include Bertha's Kitty Boutique, whose locations in the fictional "Dales" shopping centers ("Roy 'n' Dale, Airedale, Teasdale, Clydesdale, Chippendale, Mondale, and all the other fine shopping centers") allude to various real people and things, and The Catchup &lt;!-- CORRECT SPELLING, see http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/20030927/scripts/catchup.shtml --&gt;Advisory Board — its name a mashup of the common "catsup" and "ketchup" spellings—which has the tagline "Catchup: For the good times."&lt;ref name=CatchupEx&gt;{{cite web| last1=Keillor| first1=Garrison| first2=Tim| last2=Russell| first3=Sue| last3=Scott| first4=Rich| last4=Dworsky| last-author-amp=yes| date=February 4, 2012| title=Catchup [Segment;''A Prairie Home Companion, with Garrison Keillor'']| format=streaming video| url=http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/2012/02/04/videos/02.shtml| location=Saint Paul, MN| publisher=American Public Media| access-date=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the recurring segment "The Lives of the Cowboys" featured its own Western-themed sponsors, including Prairie Dog Granola Bars ("healthier than chewing tobacco and you don't have to spit") and Cowboy Toothpicks ("the toothpick that's guaranteed not to splinter").{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Alterations===
While much of the show is directed toward [[radio comedy]], a portion is usually devoted to some more sentimental and sometimes dark stories put together by Keillor and others. The program occasionally also features political satire. At the beginning of the June 5, 2004, show (broadcast from [[Meadowbrook U.S. Cellular Pavilion|Meadowbrook Musical Arts Center]] in [[Gilford, New Hampshire]]), Keillor announced that former U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] had died. A member of the audience hooted and cheered loudly, but Keillor, a staunch Democrat, gave the Republican Reagan a warm tribute in the form of a gospel song. Similarly, in a 2002 show airing the weekend after the death of Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], Keillor changed the format of the show, starting it off with Wellstone's favorite segment, Guy Noir, skipping even the show's theme song.

Released on June 9, 2006,{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} ''A Prairie Home Companion'' is a film about "a dying radio show that bears striking similarities to 'A Prairie Home Companion,'" with the actual ''APHC'' home venue, the [[Fitzgerald Theater]] in St. Paul chosen to serve "as [[set piece]], [[soundstage]] and [[framing device]]".&lt;ref name=CarrNYT050723&gt;{{cite journal| last=Carr| first=David| date=July 23, 2005| title=Lake Wobegon Goes Hollywood (or Is It Vice Versa?), With a Pretty Good Cast| journal=The New York Times| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/23/movies/MoviesFeatures/lake-wobegon-goes-hollywood-or-is-it-vice-versa-with.html| access-date = December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was written by Garrison Keillor and directed by [[Robert Altman]], and shot digitally, with camera by Altman's son, [[Robert Altman Jr.]]; the film stars Keillor, [[Meryl Streep]], [[Tommy Lee Jones]], [[Lily Tomlin]], [[Kevin Kline]], [[John C.

'''''Assassin's Creed''''' is an [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] stealth [[video game]] franchise created by [[Patrice Désilets]], [[Jade Raymond]] and [[Corey May]], developed and published by [[Ubisoft]] using the game engine [[Anvil (game engine)|Anvil Next]]. It depicts in the centuries-old struggle, now and then, between the [[Assassins]], who fight for peace with free will, and the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], who desire peace through control. The series features [[historical fiction]], [[science fiction]] and [[fictional characters|characters]], intertwined with real-world [[historical events]] and [[historical figures|figures]]. For the majority of time players would control an Assassin in the past history, while they also play as Desmond Miles or an Assassin Initiate in the present day, who hunt down their Templar targets.

The video game series took inspiration from the novel ''[[Alamut (Bartol novel)|Alamut]]'' by the Slovenian writer [[Vladimir Bartol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/148805/interviews/assassins-creed/|title=Interview: Assassin's Creed|publisher=CVG|accessdate=September 2, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025102806/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/148805/interviews/assassins-creed/|archivedate=October 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while building upon concepts from the ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-assassins-creed|title=The Making Of: Assassin's Creed|publisher=EDGE|date=August 27, 2012|accessdate=March 3, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228044009/http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-assassins-creed/|archivedate=December 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It begins with [[Assassin's Creed (video game)|the self-titled game]] in 2007, and has featured eleven main games. The most recent released game is 2018's ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]''. 

A new story and time period are introduced in each entry, and gameplay elements evolve from the previous one. There are three story arcs in the series. For the first five main games, the framing story is set in 2012 and features series protagonist [[Desmond Miles]] who uses a machine called the Animus and relives the memories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the [[2012 phenomenon|2012 apocalypse]]. In games till [[Assassin's Creed Syndicate]], Abstergo employees and Assassin initiates recorded genetic memories using the Helix software, helping the Templars and Assassins find new Pieces of Eden in the modern world. The latest two games, [[Assassin's Creed Origins]] and [[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]] follow ex-Abstergo employee Layla Hassan as she is recruited into the Assassin's Creed.

Main games of ''Assassin's Creed'' are set in an [[open world]] and presented from the [[third-person perspective]] where the protagonists take down targets using their combat and stealth skills with the exploitation of the environment. Freedom of exploration is given to the player the historical settings to finish main and side quests. Apart from single-player missions, some games also provide competitive and cooperative multiplayer gameplay. While main games are produced for major consoles and desktop platforms, multiple spin-off games were also released in accompany for consoles, mobiles, and handhelds platforms.

The main games in the ''Assassin's Creed'' video game series have received generally positive reviews for their ambition in visuals, game design, and narratives, with criticism towards the yearly release cycle and frequent bugs. The spin-off games received mixed to positive reviews. The video game series has received multiple awards and nominations, including Game of the Year awards. It is also commercially successful, selling over 100 million copies {{as of|2016|9|lc=y}}, becoming Ubisoft's best-selling franchise and one of the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|highest selling video game franchises of all time]]. ''Assassin's Creed'' was adapted by its [[Assassin's Creed (film)|self-titled film]], which received negative reviews. A book series of art books, encyclopedias, comics, novelizations, and [[Assassin's Creed (book series)|novels]] is also published. All of the media take place within the same continuity as the main video game series.

==History==
[[File:Ubisoft developper team of Assasians creed on Quebec Remparts vs Titan d'Acadie-Bathurst on Centre Vidéotron, Québec city 02.jpg|thumb|Members of Ubisoft Quebec, developer team of the latest title in the series, ''Assassin's Creed Odyssey'']]
The ''Assassin's Creed'' series originated out of ideas for a sequel for ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'', a title developed by [[Ubisoft Montreal]] and published by [[Ubisoft]] in 2003. ''The Sands of Time'' was a full 3D adaption  for the [[PlayStation 2]] of the original ''Prince of Persia'' games, and included a number of [[parkour]] moves and combat. ''The Sands of Time'' was a critical and financial success, leading Ubisoft to request Ubisoft Montreal to develop a sequel, aiming for the [[seventh generation of video game consoles|next console generation]]. The Ubisoft Montreal team decided on taking the gameplay from ''The Sands of Time'' into a [[open world]] approach, taking advantage of the improved processing power to render larger spaces and crowds. Narratively, the team wanted to move away from the Prince simply being someone next in line for the throne but to have to work for it; combined with research into secret societies led them to focus on the [[Assassins]], heavily borrowing from the novel ''[[Alamut (Bartol novel)|Alamut]]''.&lt;ref name="polygon oral"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/features/2018/10/3/17924770/assassins-creed-an-oral-history-patrice-desilets | title=  Assassin’s Creed: An oral history | first = Richard | last = Moss | date = October 3, 2018 | accessdate = October 3, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They developed a narrative where the player would control an Assassin that served as a bodyguard for a non-playable Prince, leading them to call this game ''Prince of Persia: Assassin''. Ubisoft was not happy with a ''Prince of Persia'' game without the Prince as the playable character, but this led to the marketing division to suggest the name ''Assassin's Creed'', playing off the creed of the Assassins, "nothing is true; everything is permitted". Ubisoft Montreal ran with this in creating a wholly new [[intellectual property]], eliminating the Prince and creating the conflict between the Assassins and [[Templar Knights]]. Further, in postulating what other assassinations they could account for throughout human history, they came onto the idea of [[genetic memory]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} and created the "Animus" device and modern storyline elements, which further allowed them to explain certain facets of gameplay, such as accounting when the player fails a mission, in the same way they had done in ''The Sands of Time''.&lt;ref name="polygon oral"/&gt;

Following release of the first ''Assassin's Creed'' in 2007, Ubisoft Montreal and other Ubisoft studios use the series to present games from various historical periods, striving for historical accuracy while conceding some elements for gameplay.&lt;ref name="polygon oral"/&gt;

==Premise==
The ''Assassin's Creed'' games primarily revolve around the rivalry between two ancient secret societies — the [[Assassins]] and the [[Knights Templar]] — and their indirect relation to an [[Ancient astronauts|ancient species pre-dating humanity]], referred to within the games as "those who came before", whose society, along with much of Earth's biosphere, was destroyed by a massive [[Coronal mass ejection|solar storm]] thousands of years before the games. The games' real-world chronological setting begins in the year 2012, but most of the gameplay is in historical settings.

Within the franchise, Abstergo Industries is a [[mega-corporation]] [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] with multiple branches, secretly run by modern Knights Templar. The company is the present-day main antagonist of the franchise. Abstergo secretly created the "Animus", a device that allows its users to "re-live" and experience the memories of their genetic ancestors within their bloodline through a virtual simulation. Overexposure to the animus causes the "bleeding effect", which results in giving the user skills and abilities of his ancestors, but is also dangerous for the user as it can damage their mind, causing symptoms such as [[dementia]], [[insanity]], [[dissociative identity disorder]] or [[brain damage]]. Abstergo is seeking to discover the location of several historical artifacts, known as the "Pieces of Eden". Such artifacts hold great power, and are capable of controlling [[free will]]. Abstergo seeks to use them to remove free will and bring humanity into one single unified group, while the Assassins oppose them. In order to find the Pieces of Eden, Abstergo is abducting people whose ancestors are suspected to have had historically confirmed or suspected interactions with such devices, forcing the kidnapped person into the Animus and searching for clues on their ancestors' memories within the Animus.

===Protagonists===
{{main|List of Assassin's Creed characters}}
[[Desmond Miles]] is a bartender who is a descendant of several lines of prominent [[Assassins]]; though raised as an Assassin, he left his nomadic family to seek out a more common lifestyle. He is initially kidnapped by Abstergo, which is aware of his ancestral lineage. Desmond is forced into the Animus and is revealed to be subject 17; many of the sixteen previous subjects died as a result of Animus over-exposure.

Desmond is later rescued by a small team of modern-day Assassins and agrees to work with them, continuing to experience the memories of his ancestors to discover the locations of additional Pieces of Eden so they can be recovered before Abstergo can do so. From the bleeding effect, Desmond gains some of the Assassin skills of his predecessors at the cost of living with multiple sets of memories and personalities in his mind.

Within the Animus, Desmond explores the memories of a number of Assassins, including [[Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad]], an initially disgraced Assassin working to redeem himself during the [[Third Crusade]]; [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze]], an Assassin in Italy during the late 15th and early 16th centuries of the [[Italian Renaissance]]; and [[Ratonhnhaké:ton]], otherwise known as Connor, a half-[[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], half-[[British people|British]] Assassin during the [[American Revolution]].

Throughout these events, Desmond learns of allusions to the prophetic [[2012 phenomenon|end of the world in 2012]] from a former Animus test subject, Subject 16; the event turns out to be a repeat of the disaster which wiped out the ancient civilization, and he finds out that his memories hold the key to Earth's surviving a second solar storm. During his experiences, Desmond is aided by holographic projections of three of the ancient race's rulers: Jupiter, Minerva, and Juno.

After Desmond dies to ensure Earth's survival, his memories, which have survived through genetic samples of his DNA,&lt;ref name="GI preview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_iv_black_flag/b/playstation4/archive/2013/03/04/assassin-39-s-creed-iv-black-flag-preview.aspx|title=Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag|author=Bryan Vore|publisher=Gameinformer.com|date=March 4, 2013|accessdate=March 4, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306035746/http://www.gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_iv_black_flag/b/playstation4/archive/2013/03/04/assassin-39-s-creed-iv-black-flag-preview.aspx|archivedate=March 6, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; are accessed by Abstergo, which hires a new subject to enter the Animus.

== Gameplay ==
While the games are often presented through protagonist Desmond Miles, the bulk of the game is played as Desmond experiences the memories of his ancestors through an advanced device called the Animus. This provides a means of a diegetic interface, showing Desmond's ancestor's health, equipment, goals, and other features as part of the Animus interface. The Animus is based on the player controlling the assassin to maintain the synchronization between Desmond and his ancestor's memories. Performing actions that go against the Assassin's way or dying breaks the synchronization, effectively requiring the player to restart at a previous checkpoint. Furthermore, the player cannot explore outside areas that the assassin has not experienced yet. There are also abnormalities within the Animus from previous users of the device.

While playing as the Assassin characters, the games are generally presented from a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]] in an [[open world]] environment, focusing on [[Stealth game|stealth]] and [[parkour]]. The games use a mission structure to follow the main story, generally assigning the player to complete an assassination of public figureheads or a covert mission. Alternatively, several side missions are available, such as mapping out the expansive cities from a high perch followed by performing a "leap of faith" into a haystack below, collecting treasures hidden across the cities, exploring ruins for relics, building a brotherhood of assassins to perform other tasks, or funding the rebuilding of a city through purchasing and upgrading of shops and other features. At times, the player is in direct control of Desmond, who by nature of the Animus use has learned Assassin techniques through the bleeding effect, as well as their genetic ability of Eagle Vision, which separates friend, foe and assassination targets by illuminating people in different colors. Through the Animus interface, the player can go back to retry any past mission already completed; for example, in ''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'', the player achieves better synchronization results by performing the mission in a specific manner such as by only killing the mission's target.

The games use the concept of "active" versus "passive" moves, with "active" moves, such as running, climbing the sides of buildings, or jumping between rooftops, more likely to alert the attention of nearby guards. When the guards become alerted, the player must either fight them or break their line of sight and locate a hiding place, such as a haystack or a well, and wait until the guards' alert is reduced. The combat system allows for a number of unique weapons, armor, and moves, including the use of a hidden blade set in a bracer on the Assassin's arm, and which also can be used to quietly assassinate targets.

===Main series===

====''Assassin's Creed''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed (video game)}}
Desmond Miles is captured by Abstergo and forced to use a machine called the Animus to explore Altaïr ibn-La'Ahad's memories during the time of the [[Third Crusade]]. Desmond begins to witness events after Altaïr breaks all three tenets of the Assassin Brotherhood while attempting to stop [[Robert IV de Sablé|Robert de Sablé]] from taking a Piece of Eden. [[Al Mualim]], the Brotherhood's leader, demotes Altaïr to Novice and tasks him with assassinating the nine Knights Templars, including de Sablé, to regain his former status. Altaïr's quest eventually leads him to face de Sablé in the presence of King [[Richard I of England]] warning the King of de Sablé's plot to kill him. Altaïr defeats de Sablé, but with his last words, de Sablé reveals that there were ten Templars, the last being Al Mualim, who now holds the Piece of Eden. Altaïr returns to face Al Mualim and struggles to fight through illusions created by the Piece, but eventually kills Al Mualim. When Altaïr recovers the piece, he and those watching the Animus view a holographic map showing where other artifacts are located across the globe. Desmond is pulled from the Animus, and was going to be killed, but his life is spared by [[Lucy Stillman]], an Assassin working as a mole within Abstergo, as she claims they might need to further examine his memories later. He comes to learn that a former test subject had left messages only Desmond can see, foretelling the end of the world in 2012.

The first ''Assassin's Creed'' introduced core elements that remained  in the rest of the game series. The game creates fictionalized, historical versions of [[Masyaf]] (the Brotherhood's location), [[Jerusalem]], [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and [[Damascus]], and incorporates a number of documented historical figures into the story. Other core elements include the virtualized Animus system, free running, climbing, stealth, [[parkour]], and the initial formulation of the combat system. The game requires the player to complete a number of side quests before they are able to obtain an assassin quest from a local Brotherhood guidemaster in each city, but this side quest prerequisite was abandoned in future games.

====''Assassin's Creed II''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed II}}
Lucy returns and breaks Desmond out of Abstergo, taking him to an Assassin safehouse to work alongside Shaun, a historian, and Rebecca, their technical support. Using an improved version of the Animus, Desmond takes witness to Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young nobleman from the late 15th century in [[Florence]], shortly before the execution of Ezio's father and brothers by order of a corrupt official working for the Templars. He, his mother, and sister take to hiding at the Monteriggioni villa owned by his uncle Mario, who helps to train Ezio in the ways of an Assassin. Ezio and Mario discover that Rodrigo Borgia is the figurehead of a number of Templars all who were accomplices in the execution of his family, and with help of allies like [[Leonardo da Vinci]], methodically assassinate the lower-ranked Templars, while learning that Borgia has acquired a Piece of Eden called the Apple. Eventually, Ezio corners Borgia, who hands over the Piece and flees; Ezio is inducted into the ranks of the Brotherhood and believed to be a prophet based on their codex. A decade later, the Brotherhood learns that Borgia has since become [[Pope Alexander VI]], using the Church's influence to strengthen the Templars. Ezio invades [[Vatican City]] and confronts Borgia, discovering that the Papal staff is also a Piece of Eden. Defeating Borgia but sparing his life, Ezio uses both the Apple and the Papal staff to reveal a chamber of ancient technology. Inside, he is addressed by a hologram of a humanoid female that calls herself Minerva who speaks directly to Desmond through Ezio. Minerva explains how her society had pre-dated humanity's, but a great disaster nearly wiped them out, and warns that another event is due to occur soon, putting the fate of humanity in Desmond's hands. Upon this discovery, Desmond and his allies find the safehouse has been compromised by Abstergo and flee.

Similar to the first game, ''Assassin's Creed II'' takes place in historical recreations of [[Venice]], [[Florence]], [[Forlì]], [[San Gimignano]], and the [[Tuscany|Tuscan countryside]], and incorporates events during that period as part of the story. Missions are divided into main story missions, themselves divided into memory sequences reflecting points in Ezio's life, and side missions which can be accomplished at any time; this approach to mission structure remains consistent in the other games in the series. The Monteriggioni villa provides several functions which can be expanded on by paying money for upgrades of surrounding buildings, or by purchasing artwork, weapons, and armor for the villa; in turn, the villa will generate wealth for the player at a rate influenced by the upgrades and acquisition of these items. Additional quests involve locating secret Assassin seals, and finding hidden marks left by "Subject 16", a former Animus user, that hint at the nature of Minerva's society.

====''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood}}
Desmond and his allies retreat to the ruins of the Monteriggioni villa, and Desmond reenters the Animus to continue Ezio's memories, specifically to identify the location of the Apple. After facing Rodrigo Borgia, Ezio returned to Monteriggioni, but the villa is soon attacked by forces under the command of [[Cesare Borgia]], Rodrigo's son. Mario is killed and the Apple is stolen. Ezio vows revenge by helping to free the people of Rome from the Borgia family. As Ezio works covertly to turn the city against the Borgias, he gains followers that want to join his cause, and Ezio trains them in the way of the Assassins. In an attempt to assassinate Cesare and Rodrigo at the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], Ezio instead witnesses Cesare forcing his father to eat a poisoned apple that Rodrigo had prepared to kill his son. Ezio chases down Cesare and eventually captures him and recovers the Apple. Cesare is taken to prison in Viana, Spain but manages to escape with help of his allies. The Assassins lead the fight against Cesare and the remaining loyal Borgia troops, and eventually Ezio throws Cesare from the castle walls, killing him. With no perceived further threats, Ezio takes to hide the Apple under the [[Colosseum]]. In the present, Desmond is able to navigate through the underground chambers beneath the Colosseum to locate the Apple. As he picks it up, Desmond is witness to another hologram figure, calling herself Juno, and who controls Desmond to stab Lucy (because Lucy has defected to the Templars) before he falls into a coma.

''Brotherhood'' shares many of the same features as the previous game though it takes place primarily in Rome. Similar to the villa, the player is able to spend money to buy and upgrade shops and other facilities throughout the city as to increase revenue they can collect from it; however, the player will be required to destroy Borgia towers that control various sections of the city before they can do so.  The Brotherhood of Assassins is introduced, by which, after saving citizens from certain events, the player can invite these citizens as Assassins; they can then be dispatched to remote locations across Europe to gain experience and money, or can be called in to help the player directly in a mission. For the first time in the series, the game features online multiplayer. Players play as Abstergo employees, who, through the use of the Animus, take on the genetic memories of Renaissance Templars in various game modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://kotaku.com/5531849/gamestop-placeholder-art-names-assassins-creed-brotherhood---update |title=GameStop Placeholder Art Names Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood – Update |newspaper=[[Kotaku]] |date=May 5, 2010 |accessdate=October 21, 2010 |last=Fahey |first=Mike |author-link=Mike Fahey |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829145121/http://kotaku.com/5531849/gamestop-placeholder-art-names-assassins-creed-brotherhood---update |archivedate=August 29, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last game to feature ''Assassin's Creed'' creator [[Patrice Désilets]], as the creative director of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/07/20/life-after-ubisoft-again.aspx |title=Assassin's Creed Creator Talks Life After Ubisoft, Again |last=Bertz |first=Matt |date=July 20, 2015 |access-date=November 29, 2017 |newspaper=[[GameInformer]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822214710/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/07/20/life-after-ubisoft-again.aspx |archivedate=August 22, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/06/11/patrice-d-233-silets-walks-away-from-ubisoft-and-assassin-s-creed.aspx |title=Update: Patrice Désilets Walks Away From Ubisoft And Assassin's Creed |last=McNamara |first=Andy |author-link=Andy McNamara |date=June 11, 2010 |access-date=November 29, 2017 |newspaper=[[GameInformer]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201180243/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/06/11/patrice-d-233-silets-walks-away-from-ubisoft-and-assassin-s-creed.aspx |archivedate=December 1, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed: Revelations}}

Within the computerized "core" of the Animus, Subject 16 ([[Clay Kaczmarek]]) explains to a comatose Desmond that his mind must achieve full synchronization with Altaïr and Ezio, or he will fall into [[dementia]]. Desmond sees Ezio's memories, years after ''Brotherhood'', Ezio researches the Assassins' history and travels to Masyaf to locate Altaïr's library, rumored to hold great power within. The Templars also seek to open this library, but it is locked by five keys, hidden in the Ottoman-held [[Constantinople]]. Ezio finds the city in a feud  between brothers [[Selim I|Selim]] and [[Şehzade Ahmet|Ahmet]] vying for the Sultanate. Ezio is aided by [[List of Assassin's Creed characters#Sofia Sartor|Sofia Sartor]]; the two fall in love. Eventually, Ahmet reveals himself to be a Templar, and is killed by Selim after he battles with Ezio. Ezio uses the keys to witness Altaïr's memories before and after [[Al Mualim]]'s death, which show the death of Altaïr's wife and youngest son in the midst of a [[coup d'etat]] within the Assassins. Altair exiles himself for twenty years, eventually returning to Masyaf to kill the usurper and retake control. Altaïr inscribes his memories in the keys and asks his friend [[Niccolò Polo]] to hide them. Afterwards, Ezio and Sofia go to Masyaf and open the library to find Altaïr's corpse and a Piece of Eden. Ezio leaves it and his assassin tools, and tells Desmond, understanding now of his role as a messenger to him. A holographic being calling himself Jupiter explains to Desmond (through Ezio) how his society perished as a result of a massive [[solar flare]] apocalypse, and that the key to stop the 2012 solar flare lies in the first civilization's technology commanded by vaults linked to a central vault in New York. Within the Animus, Clay sacrifices himself to allow Desmond to wake up from his coma, his memories complete. Along with Shaun, Rebecca, and his father William, Desmond heads to New York to save humanity.

Originally ''Revelations'' was announced as ''Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy'', and conceptualized as a [[Nintendo 3DS]] title focusing on Ezio traveling to Masyaf. However, on July 15, 2011, it was announced as cancelled. The reason behind such "cancellation" was that Ubisoft had decided to expand the idea further, cancel the 3DS development and fully shift all development duties towards PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC to release the game as a full-fledged main installment of the franchise. The original plot remained, and evolved into the plot seen in the final game, which became ''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Philips|first=Tom|title=Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy canned|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-15-assassins-creed-lost-legacy-canned|publisher=Eurogamer|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718043046/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-15-assassins-creed-lost-legacy-canned|archivedate=July 18, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included were many new systems and additional weapons such as bomb-crafting, allowing the player to create explosive, distraction and tactical bombs, using materials found throughout the world and on Assassin's Guild missions. The hookblade was also introduced, which can be used in free-running (to travel along zip wires and climb more easily) and in combat (to manipulate enemies). Eagle Vision was upgraded into the Eagle Sense, allowing Ezio to not only see where his enemies and targets are but also, where they have been and where they are moving to. As the player progresses through, Ezio can train new recruits to defend "dens" (Assassin HQs) and an upgraded Assassin's missions section called "Mediterranean Defense" in which the player works to strip control of various cities from Templar hands. The multiplayer mode returned in ''Revelations'', with more characters, modes, and maps, and by advancing up through levels of experience, the player learns more about Abstergo's history.

====''Assassin's Creed III''====
{{Main|Assassin's Creed III}}
{{Long plot|section|date=January 2017}}

Desmond and his allies arrive at the Temple entrance in a cave in the New York area on October 31, 2012, and open its door using the Apple of Eden, discovering a larger chamber of Precursor technology behind it, including another door requiring a key. Desmond suddenly falls into a [[fugue state]], and is put into the Animus.

In the Animus, he experiences the memories of Haytham Kenway, who is later revealed as a Templar [[British people|British]] agent, who had gone to the American Colonies with a stolen medallion, and, with Templar allies including [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]], gained the [[Mohawk people]]'s trust as the means to find a Temple's location, but to his annoyance, the medallion did not open the Temple for him. The remainder of the game shifts protagonist, to the memories of Haytham's son [[Ratonhnhaké:ton]], whose heritage is half [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]]. As a young boy, he witnesses Lee and his troops set fire to his village, killing his mother; years later, he is shown a Piece of Eden, through which Juno speaks to him and instructs him to get training from the retired Assassin, Achilles Davenport, who later inducts him into the order and nicknames him Connor (in memory of his dead son, deceased in the [[American Revolution]]). Through him, Connor meets Patriots in the Revolution, helping them to stop several Templar plans, including an assassination attempt against [[George Washington]]. Between memories, Desmond helps his allies to recover power sources to power the Temple scattered about the globe, including one held by Abstergo.

Connor eventually faces his father, who offers a ceasefire, as he is also after Benjamin Church for usurping his authority. They team up to investigate, Kenway warns Connor about the Patriots, seeking to remove Connor's people from their lands due to fear of an allegiance against the British. Connor eventually hunts and kills Lee, takes the medallion and ends the Templar threat. He is despondent to find his tribe's village abandoned save for the Piece of Eden; through it, Juno tells him to hide the amulet. Desmond wakes up on December 21, and with his allies finds the buried medallion, key to the inner Temple door, behind is a control sphere capable of stopping the solar flare. Juno appears and encourages Desmond to touch it, but Minerva appears and warns him not to, as it would release Juno as an entity that would protect against the solar flare, but would also be a threat to mankind's future. Juno says Minerva would rather have most of humanity wiped out, and Desmond survive to be a religious figure to lead the survivors, ultimately leading into conflict. Desmond opts to release Juno, believing humanity will have a better chance fighting Juno. The energy from the control sphere, protects Earth from the solar flare, but kills Desmond. Juno tells Desmond's corpse that his work is now done, and now it is time for her to work.

''Assassin's Creed III'' is structured similarly to the previous games, with missions taking place on an open-world map based on Colonial Boston and New York, and offers a large wilderness area, the Frontier and in the Davenport Homestead, where the player can hunt animals for materials, which then subsequently can be used to construct goods to be traded and sold throughout the colonies. Naval battles were introduced, wherein the player must steer a warship named ''Aquila'' in dangerous waters and perform ship-to-ship combat with cannons and mounted guns. In Assassin's Creed III there are a large assortment of side missions to play and many different outfits to purchase as the player progresses through the game. The modern-day aspects of the story were also significantly expanded, and featured missions taking place in, among other locations, Manhattan, Rome and Brazil.

====''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag''====
{{Main|Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag}}
Samples taken from Desmond Miles' body in the moments after his death have enabled Abstergo Industries to continue to explore his genetic memories using the Animus' newfound cloud computing abilities. The unnamed player character is hired by Abstergo's entertainment division to sift through the memories of Edward Kenway, an eighteenth-century pirate and the grandfather of Connor. Ostensibly, this is to gather material for an Animus-powered interactive video game, but in reality, Abstergo and the Templars are searching for the Observatory, a Precursor structure that allows the user to see through the eyes of a subject. As Kenway, the player must unravel a conspiracy between high-ranking Templars to manipulate the British, Spanish and French empires into locating the Sage – later identified as [[Bartholomew Roberts]] – who is the only man who can lead them to the Observatory.

In the present day, the player is contacted by John, Abstergo Entertainment's information technology manager. John convinces the player that his employer knows more than they are telling, and encourages them to investigate in more detail. He arranges for the player to access the Animus' core, at which point Juno materialises into an incorporeal form. She reveals that although it was necessary to open her temple to avert disaster, the world was not ready for her, and she is unable to affect it or possess the player character as her agents intended. John is unmasked as the reincarnated form of the Sage and attempts to murder the player to cover up the failed attempt at resurrecting Juno, but is killed by Abstergo's security before he can do so. As Roberts, the Sage admits to Kenway that he owes no allegiance to the Assassins or the Templars and instead uses whoever he thinks represents his best chance of achieving his ends.

''Assassin's Creed: Project Legacy'' was a single-player [[Browser game|browser-based]] [[Role-playing video game|role-playing game]] Facebook application, designed as a promotion, and tie-in for ''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood''. The game is mostly [[Online text-based role-playing game|text-based]], but includes graphics and sound as well as some video.

Players are test subjects for Abstergo Industries who relive the lives of other test subjects' Assassin ancestors; instead of using the Animus, players use the Data Dump Scanner (DDS).

The first mission pack is titled "Italian Wars", and is divided into four chapters. Chapter one focuses on [[Bartolomeo d'Alviano]] during the [[Battle of Agnadello]]. The second chapter focuses on [[Francesco Vecellio]] on a mission to kill [[Niccolò di Pitigliano]] (cousin of Bartolomeo d'Alviano). The third focuses on Mario Auditore and the protection of [[Monteriggioni]]. The fourth and final chapter focuses on [[Lucrezia Borgia#Affair with Perotto|Perotto Calderon]], an undercover assassin who watches over [[Lucrezia Borgia]], with whom he falls in love.

The second mission pack, entitled "Rome", was released November 16, 2010. The first chapter takes place between 1497 and 1503, and deals with the ex-courtesan, Fiora Cavazza. It deals with Fiora's involvement in recruiting an army for the Borgia, and her subsequent betrayal. The second takes place in 1503, and involves [[Giovanni Borgia (Infans Romanus)|Giovanni Borgia]], fleeing his family and eventually joining the assassins. Chapter three involves Francesco Vecellio, and his training to be an assassin under Ezio Auditore. Chapter four again focuses on Giovanni Borgia, now an Assassin and joining [[Hernán Cortés]] on his journey to [[Tenochtitlan]] to acquire a "Piece of Eden", one of the [[Crystal Skull]]s. Giovanni brought it to [[Paracelsus|Bombastus]] for study, resulting in the discovery of the formula for the [[Philosopher's stone]].

The third mission pack, entitled "Holidays", and its first Chapter called Ghosts of Christmas Past were released on December 21, 2010 with further missions to be released in 2011.{{update after|2011|12|31}} The first chapter takes place at various times and places in history: during the [[World War I]] [[Christmas Truce]], the ''[[Beagle 2]]'' truth, the return of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] back to [[Kingdom of England|England]], and the time of the [[Shroud of Turin]].

A fourth story pack, "The Divine Science Story Pack" was announced, but never released. Additionally, an updated user interface (referred to as the 'DDS 2.0') was announced, but not released.  The DDS 2.0 would have offered an easier method of selecting mission packs and equipment.

The game was later shut down and put on an indefinite hold.

In November 2011, a Ubisoft survey was sent out, asking participants which locations and time periods they would like to see in the "next ''Assassin's Creed'' games". These settings were [[Medieval China]], [[Victorian England]], [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese]] and/or [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish Invasion]] of the [[Americas]], the [[American Revolution]], the [[Russian Revolution]], [[Feudal Japan]], and [[Ancient Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/327625/assassins-creed-3-possible-locations-named-in-survey|title=AC:3 Possible Locations Named In Survey|publisher=CVG|date=November 29, 2011|accessdate=November 30, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130223352/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/327625/assassins-creed-3-possible-locations-named-in-survey/|archivedate=November 30, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Hutchinson, creative director of ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'', suggested the most requested ''Assassin's Creed'' settings, [[World War II]], Feudal Japan and Ancient Egypt, are "the three worst settings for an ''Assassin's Creed'' game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dutton |first=Fred |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-04-04-ubisoft-ww2-japan-and-egypt-would-make-dismal-assassins-creed-locations |title=Ubisoft: WW2, Japan and Egypt would make dismal Assassin's Creed locations |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=April 4, 2012 |accessdate=August 15, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709235650/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-04-04-ubisoft-ww2-japan-and-egypt-would-make-dismal-assassins-creed-locations |archivedate=July 9, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hutchinson stated both he and [[Corey May]] were open to the idea of a future entry set during the time of the [[British Raj]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|title=India-set Assassin's Creed on Ubisoft's radar|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/india-set-assassins-creed-on-ubisofts-radar-6370104|publisher=GameSpot|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020105717/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/india-set-assassins-creed-on-ubisofts-radar-6370104|archivedate=October 20, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which now consists of the modern states of [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Myanmar]].

In June 2013, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated on the development cycle of the games, saying, "We are making sure the teams who are creating the different iterations have enough time—two years, three years, so that they can take risk and they can change the concept enough so that it can be appealing and fresh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/ubisoft-has-three-assassins-creeds-in-development-vow-513376223|title=Ubisoft Has Three Assassin's Creeds in Development, Vows Innovation|last=Totilo|first=Stephen|date=June 14, 2013|accessdate=June 14, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617052003/http://kotaku.com/ubisoft-has-three-assassins-creeds-in-development-vow-513376223|archivedate=June 17, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following August, ''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag''{{'}}s director Ashraf Ismail said that the ending of the franchise had been written, saying "We have an idea of where the end is, what the end is.

=====''Assassin's Creed: Embers''=====
{{main|Assassin's Creed: Embers}}
The short film follows an elderly Ezio, living a peaceful life in the Tuscan countryside with his wife Sofia and his children Flavia and Marcello and writing his memoirs. One day a stranger appears, a Chinese female Assassin called [[Shao Jun]], who came to Ezio in order to seek knowledge of his life as an Assassin. Although Ezio prefers that Jun not stay, due to his desire to leave his days as an Assassin behind, Sofia allows her to stay for the night. The next day, Ezio catches Jun reading his memoirs and bids her to leave, but relents after she asks him about what it means to be an Assassin. While on a trip to [[Firenze]], Ezio then recounts his story of [[Assassin's Creed II#Plot|how his father and brothers were executed in the town square, forcing him to become an Assassin]], and how such a life is defined by the pain it brings and causes. As they leave, the two are attacked by a stranger, who appears to be of Asian origin as well. After killing him, Jun reveals that she was a former [[concubine]], now on the run from servants of the Chinese [[Zhengde Emperor]], and explains how her former master rescued her from his influence. After returning to his home, Ezio tells Sofia and his children to leave, knowing that others would come. He then teaches Jun the key to liberating her people from the Emperor's influence. Later that night, Ezio's villa is attacked by more of Shao Jun's enemies, and after a fight, he successfully eliminates them all. The next morning, Ezio hands Shao Jun a small box and tells her it may come to use one day, but only if "you lose your way". He then sends her away as two riders appear at the villa. Sometime afterward Ezio journeys to Firenze with his wife Sofia and their daughter Flavia, despite suffering from heart problems. While resting on a bench and after having a short conversation with a young man with a scar on his face, similar to the sort of man he used to be, he exhales and dies in view of his family. The film then ends as a final letter from Ezio to Sofia is read, saying that of all the things that kept him going throughout life, love for the world around him was the strongest of them all.

====''Assassin's Creed: Graphic Novel''====
In the limited edition of ''Assassin's Creed'', an 8-page [[graphic novel]] was included, that showed two side-stories of Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad and Desmond Miles. The story serves as a prelude to the first ''Assassin's Creed'' game and is narrated simultaneously by both characters. In it, the novel covers Desmond's escape from Abstergo in the year 2012 and also one of Altaïr's assassination missions in the year 1191. The start of the novel involves the introduction of the two characters with Altaïr calling himself a hunter, while Desmond is a prisoner. Although initially they describe themselves otherwise, by the end of the novel they both re-introduce themselves as assassins.

====''Assassin's Creed, Volume 1: Desmond''====
''Assassin's Creed Volume 1: Desmond'' is a French-language graphic novel written by Eric Corbeyran and drawn by Djilalli Defaux. It has been released in France, Canada, Belgium, Poland and Italy.

It also features Subject 16 (referred to as Michael) and a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] assassin named Aquilus. However, events in the comic book are different from what happens in the game. It is said that Subject 16 is alive but trapped in the animus, a virtual reality simulator used to relive memories of ancient relatives, but there's no mention of Shaun or Rebecca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ju7K9De8ck |title=Assassin's Creed : Desmond – Trailer de la bande dessinée |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=October 21, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222012930/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ju7K9De8ck |archivedate=February 22, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Assassin's Creed, Volume 2: Aquilus''====
''Assassin's Creed Volume 2: Aquilus'' is a French-language graphic novel written by Eric Corbeyran and drawn by Djilalli Defaux. The story opens with a young Desmond recalling his conversation with his father. He wakes up and has a conversation with Lucy.

In the meantime, Desmond relives memories of Aquilus through the animus after his apparent death in the first volume. The Roman assassin is rescued by his cousin, Accipiter, and is tasked with a quest to save [[Lugdunum]]. He meets with his father and discovers an artifact of the first civilization: an [[ankh]] which can temporarily revive the dead. The mysterious object is then stolen by a Templar senator, Vultur, who kills Aquilus' father.

The modern day story continues as Assassins fight Abstergo agents when they're ambushed on the road. Later, it is revealed that there's a traitor among in the Assassins' truck, and Desmond deals with the situation. The group finally arrives in Monteriggioni and at the end, it's hinted that the ankh artifact might be hidden within the town's walls.

====''Assassin's Creed, Volume 3: Accipiter''====
Jonathan Hawk was sent by a suited executive and a lab technician to relive Accipiter's memories. He was sent to 259 CE, when Accipiter's Alamans were crossing the Rodanus into Genava and Aube to face the Roman forces at Oppidum. The battle raged bloodily and long, but Accipiter's forces were eventually victorious.

====''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood''====
''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'' is a continuation of the ''Assassin's Creed'' series written by Oliver Bowden and published by Penguin Books.

===''Assassin's Creed: Encyclopedia''===
[[UbiWorkshop]] released an encyclopedia of the ''Assassin's Creed'' series in 2011. Initially intended as an art book, the project gathered so much material that the company decided to expand it into an encyclopedia. It features works of artists, such as Craig Mullins, Tavis Coburn, 123Klan, Gabz and James NG. Artists were given creative freedom, as they were able to create a unique Assassin from the period of their choosing. The art book contains a "carte blanche" section, which is going to contain fan-submitted artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubiworkshop.com/artbook.html|title=Artists for hire|publisher=Ubiworkshop.com|accessdate=October 21, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822160318/http://www.ubiworkshop.com/artbook.html|archivedate=August 22, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/your-face-stabbing-art-could-be-featured-in-assassins-creed-art-book/|title=Your face-stabbing art could be featured in Assassin's Creed art book|publisher=GamesRadar|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117034023/http://www.gamesradar.com/your-face-stabbing-art-could-be-featured-in-assassins-creed-art-book/|archivedate=January 17, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag'' introduces the character of Olivier Garneau, as the CEO of video game company Abstergo Entertainment (who helps Ubisoft to develop the ''Assassin's Creed'' video games within the franchise's fictional plot). During the game's plot, Garneau goes to [[Chicago]], the setting of Ubisoft's game ''[[Watch Dogs]]''. In the latter video game, Garneau is the subject of a side mission that sees playable protagonist Aiden Pearce saving him from being kidnapped, it is implied that by the Assassin's Brotherhood. Additionally, two characters in the game are seen playing ''Assassin's Creed II''. Ubisoft has described those appearances as small Easter eggs, and has neither confirmed nor denied a shared continuity between both franchises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-02-assassins-creed-4-character-crosses-over-to-watch-dogs|title=Assassin's Creed 4 character crosses over to Watch Dogs|last=Phillips|first=Tom|work=Eurogamer|date=June 2, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828061707/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-02-assassins-creed-4-character-crosses-over-to-watch-dogs|archivedate=August 28, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Assassin's Creed Origins'' mentions the news about Garneau's incident in Chicago, along with a picture of Aiden Pearce killing Garneau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/more-evidence-that-assassin-s-creed-and-watch-dogs-are-1819936896|title=More Evidence That Assassin's Creed And Watch Dogs Are Set In The Same Universe|first=Stephen|last=Totilo|date=|website=kotaku.com|accessdate=May 8, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124142716/https://kotaku.com/more-evidence-that-assassin-s-creed-and-watch-dogs-are-1819936896|archivedate=January 24, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ubisoft still has not confirmed a shared continuity, between both video game franchises, but this is the only crossover that seems to imply a shared plot.

'''Baton twirling''' is a art involving the manipulation of a metal rod and the performer's body to a coordinated routine.&lt;ref name= WBTF-Sport&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.wbtf.org/about/sport| website= WBTF.org| publisher= World Baton Twirling Federation| title= The Sport| year= 2014| access-date= January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to [[rhythmic gymnastics]] or [[color guard (flag spinning)]].

==Description==
Twirling combines dance, agility, coordination, flexibility and often [[gymnastics]] while manipulating a single baton or multiple batons. A performance is typically accompanied by music. When judged, fundamental characteristics include the handling of the baton to create visual images, pictures, and patterns executed with dexterity both close in and around the body and the proper release of the baton into the air. The discipline requires the simultaneous blending of these fundamental characteristics, utilizing time and space to display both technical merit and artistic expression. There are multiple types of baton twirlers. Majorettes, twirl in a group for a high school or college with its [[marching band]]. A twirler may perform as part of a group which marches in a [[parade]] or in front of an audience. Competitive twirlers may compete solo or as part of a group. Twirlers start learning the skills as early as age 2, but usually in grade school age, although some begin as late as high school age.

Baton twirling requires specific knowledge of how to manipulate the baton and where to hold the baton.  The baton can be described as a rod, usually a lightweight metal such as [[aluminum]], with weighted, resilient ends, typically [[rubber]].  The baton's rubber ends attach to the rod and can be replaced.  On one end, there is a large tip that is called the ball. On the other end, there is a small tip simply called the tip.  The baton is balanced slightly off center to allow for proper rolling.  The rod can be one of several thicknesses. Thicker, heavier rods are better for rolling, while thinner ones are better for [[finger roll]]s.  The rubber ends can have different designs or weights depending on the manufacturer. Additionally, [https://www.starlinebaton.com/slb-grplist.asp?pid=2 Star Line] is the most common manufacturer of batons. Common types are the star, tulip and simple round tips.  The length is the baton from tip to tip should be one inch longer than the distance from the user's [[armpit]] to the tip of the user's middle finger. The baton is manipulated from three positions, depending on the trick: from the ball, one hand from the tip, and mostly from the center of the baton.  The rod of the baton wrapped with tape, either for decoration or for added grip, using tape specially employed for that purpose. The tape can be anything from [[electrical tape]] to [[tennis tape]].

In addition to twirling baton(s), twirlers are known for manipulating multiple pieces of equipment including fire baton(s), machetes, fire machetes, hoop baton, streamer, flag baton, swing baton, rifle, lighted baton, double flag baton, and sabers. All equipment that is used by twirlers of the NBTA, USTA, and WBTF are show quality pieces of equipment that are engineered to be easily manipulated in a twirling routine. Therefore, the rifle, sabre, and machetes are not real weapons, as they are props created specifically for twirling. However, fire batons are, in fact, real flaming batons. The twirler will soak the ends of the fire batons overnight in a flammable substance, commonly kerosene, tiki oil, or gasoline. After the ends have finished soaking, it is important that the twirler shakes off any excess liquid. Finally, the ends of the baton can be set on fire using a lighter. After the twirler has finished performing, the flames can be put out through tossing the baton very fast and hard or by placing it in a fire blanket. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.starlinebaton.com/slb-grplist.asp?pid=4&lt;/ref&gt;

Baton twirling requires skillful coordination and extraordinary control of the human body. Additionally, it requires a great amount of flexibility in order to properly execute baton, dance, and gymnastics elements. [[Choreography]] for baton twirling is designed to promote expression of the body through dance and movement to create a demonstration of strength, flexibility, physical fitness, beauty, aesthetics, and harmony in coordination with the manipulation of the baton.&lt;ref&gt; name= WBTF-Sport&lt;/ref&gt;rt /&gt;

The foundation of baton twirling is the thumb toss.  This trick is accomplished from the middle of the baton.  The baton is held in one hand at the waist.  The baton is rolled over the thumb and a slight hand movement lifts it into the air.  The thumb toss can be increased in difficultly with 1 or more spins done under the toss, cartwheels, front walkovers, illusions or many more tricks.  The baton can be tosses from either hand, but proficiency in both hands is preferable.  The baton can be caught blind behind the head, at the side, under a kick, under one or both legs or in an illusion. Other tosses include the open hand toss and flat spin toss.

The sport of baton twirling has many tricks common to all twirlers.  The elbow roll is a common trick. Continuous elbow rolls go over one elbow, dip, go over the second elbow, dip at the back, and over the first elbow again.  This process can keep going as long as the baton stays in motion.  Other common tricks include fishtails, open throats, open neck rolls, mouth rolls and more.

The routines have a predictable pattern of organization, despite a unique organization of tricks based on ability.  Typically, the twirler has an initial routine constructed in each type of routine as they are ready.  That routine is changed over and over during the course of their career. In Basic March, the twirler places one hand on their left hip and cradles the baton in the other.  The twirler lifts the leg up into a chair height bend leg and lowers the foot back to the ground to the beat of "Stars and Stripes".  Strut is an expansion off of Basic March.  It also counts the hitting of the foot off the ground based on the beat of "Stars and Stripes", but other dance moves w/ the coordinated baton are incorporated into its X pattern. Solo routines don't have a specific music or beat to follow.  The twirler attempts to constantly improve the routine with greater consistent speed, difficult tricks and improved bodywork.  The routine has specific sections from the vertical, horizontal, finger and roll sections.  It can include a walk up and walk back with poses, but the walk can be a Tour Jete, leaps, skip, Step ball changes or a simple march. Modeling is completed in a T pattern with slow, graceful spins/turns. The routine can be done in a short/party/long dress or costume depending on contest rules.  Modeling can also include an interview depending on the contest.  Other routines can include 2 baton, 3 baton, flag baton, show routine or hoop.  Pageants are a large part of competitive baton twirling.  Basic Skills pageants are the introductory level where the contestant performs Basic March, Modeling and Solo.  Beginner and Intermediate pageants include Modeling/Interview, Strut and Solo.  Advanced pageants include Modeling/Interview, Show twirl, and solo.

Currently, Baton Twirlers perform at football games, basketball games, competitions, parades, and virtually anywhere where entertainment is needed. It is commonly known that after a twirling season has come to an end, each twirling company/studio will host a recital to showcase the talents obtained over the season. 

Competitive solo twirlers in the United States compete through several organizations.  These organization include United States Twirling Association, Twirling Unlimited, Twirltacular, National Baton Twirling Association and more.  Each of these organizations have their own rules. The United States Twirling Association, USTA, offers competitive routines that are unique to this association only. Moreover, these routines include L military marching, 32 count presentation, rhythm twirl, freestyle, and show twirl. Twirling Unlimited, TU, has restrictions on number of turns and continuous elbow rolls in developmental levels, but they allow gymnastics moves.  TU separates the age groups as 0-6, 7-8, 9-11, 12-14, 15+. The 0-6 and 7-8 age groups are combined for certain events. National Baton Twirling Association, NBTA, does not have developmental restrictions, but it does not permit gymnastics.  NBTA age groups are 0-4, 0-6, 7-9, 10-12. 13-15, 16+.  NBTA nations are called America's Youth on Parade, which has been held for 50 years.  AYOP has been held at Notre Dame's [[Joyce Center]] for 46 years. The event allows the soloists and groups to qualify for world competition.  AYOP is a week long event with a mixture of open events and pageants, which the twirler has to qualify for at Miss Majorette state/regional events.  The solo events of both organizations are also divided into Novice, Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, and Elite levels.  Advancement is based on a set number of wins.

===History===

[[File:Baton-practice-Manzanar-Adams.jpeg|thumb|alt=Japanese teenage girl in 1940s sweater, skirt, and blouse twirling two batons and smiling, backlit by the sun against a nearly-cloudless sky.|Baton practice, [[Manzanar War Relocation Center]], 1943. Photographed by [[Ansel Adams]].]]

Baton twirling started in Western Europe and Asia. It is thought it started at dance festivals where performers used knives, rifles, torches and sticks to twirl with and toss. The sport progressed into the armies of some countries which twirled with rifles during marches. When the army was parading, they added a rifle twirler to the front of the marchers. The rifle was then switched for a "mace". The mace was much larger than the batons of today and imbalanced. They are still used by some marching bands at parades nowadays. The mace bearer or "drum major" twirled the baton whilst leading the army or band. The maces were altered for easier twirling and now resemble the batons. They were given smaller ends of light rubber, made from hollow light metal and balanced to give accuracy to the twirler. It is thought it was the involvement of females ("drum majorettes") and the progression of twirling that prompted the lightening and balancing of the baton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.btsai.ie/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421054348/http://www.btsai.ie/history.html |archivedate=2009-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sport came to North America when Major [[Reuben Webster Millsaps]] created baton twirling when he established [[Millsaps College]] in [[Mississippi]] after the [[US Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/colosseum/loge/6944/bt_history.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+17:47:55&lt;/ref&gt;

While many member countries have their own national organizations, at the world level, three governing bodies are recognized: 
the [http://www.wbtf.org/ World Baton Twirling Federation (WBTF)], the [http://www.worldtwirling.cc/ World Twirling Association (WTA)/], and [http://www.nbta-europe.eu/index.php?page=Doc183 The Global Alliance of National Baton Twirling &amp; Majorette Associations (NBTA)/]. The WBTF and NBTA host World Championships and International Cup (WBTF), while the WTA continues to honor the origins of the sport with additional events that WBTF does not include.&lt;ref name=WTA-organization&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.worldtwirling.cc/organization.html |title= World Twirling Association |website= WorldTwirling.cc |accessdate= 2009-05-04 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090423031247/http://worldtwirling.cc/organization.html |archivedate= 2009-04-23 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The WTA was founded in 1960, by champion baton twirler Victor Faber.&lt;ref name= WTA-organization /&gt;

Established in 1977, the World Baton Twirling Federation was formed to develop, encourage, and standardize the sport. In October 1979, the Federation representatives met in [[Paris]], [[France]] to finalize all plans for the first World Championships, bringing together teams of twirlers from ten countries to compete in a spirit of healthy, athletic competition. The United States Twirling Association, Inc. hosted the first World Championships in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] in 1980. Each successive year, one member country has hosts the championships in August.&lt;ref name= WBTF-history&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.wbtf.org/about/history/| website= WBTF.org| publisher= World Baton Twirling Federation| title= History| year= 2014| access-date= January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current member countries of the WBTF include: [[Australia]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Catalonia]] ([[Spain]]), [[Croatia]], [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Philippines]], [[Scotland]], [[Seychelles]], [[Slovenia]], [[South Africa]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref name= WBTF-about&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.wbtf.org/about/| website= WBTF.org| publisher= World Baton Twirling Federation| title= About Us | year= 2014| access-date= January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current member countries of the NBTA include: [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Canada]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Scotland]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[Ukraine]], and the [[United States of America]]. Under consideration are: [[Australia]], [[Estonia]], [[Japan]], [[Slovenia]], and [[South Africa]].

==Competitive baton twirling==
Competitive baton twirling is classified by two factors, skill and age. The [http://www.batontwirling.com/NBTA/Solo2.htm NBTA], USTA, and WBTF separate twirlers by their skill levels, which range from novice, beginner, intermediate, to advanced; advancement to the next skill level is determined through the number of first place wins that the twirler has accomplished against other twirlers.
Wins obtained with no competitors in said division typically do not count towards advancement.  Next, the twirlers are classified by their age through a standard scale that is as follows:  0-6 7-9 10-12 13-15 16+.  This classification scale ensures that the competition between twirlers in each division is fair. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.batontwirling.com/NBTA/Solo2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

When competing, a twirlers attire will typically be a leotard or a skater dress that is embellished with sequins, rhinestones, fringe, and other ornate designs. Major brands of twirling costumes include [http://www.showoffinc.com/ Show-Off Inc]., [http://kenerlykreationsinc.com/ Kenerly Kreations], [http://www.sewstoppersonline.com/ Sewstoppers], and [https://www.algyperforms.com/ Algy]. Twirlers are judged on their attire during competition, especially in events such as best in costume, so it is important that they wear a costume that fits properly and looks good during competition. Footwear ranges from [https://www.starlinebaton.com/slb-proddetailsv1.asp?pid=66 instep cougars], [https://www.capezio.com/women/shoes/jazz-shoes/eos jazz shoes], to [https://www.starlinebaton.com/slb-proddetailsv1.asp?pid=361 majorette boots]. Typically, instep cougars are seen on both the competition floor and during practice. Jazz shoes are primarily used during competition, as the soft bottoms can easily be torn during practice. It is common to see the heels of jazz shoes covered in rhinestones. Majorette boots can be seen during competition; however, high school and college majorettes typically wear these on the football field and during other performances.

One of the most competitive titles in the twirling field, Miss Majorette, is a title that is given to the top baton twirlers of each state. As mentioned earlier, twirlers will be classified based on their skill and age, which allows for a Miss Majorette title in each rank. When competing for this title, twirlers will begin by competing in T or Circle T Modelling, Interview, Solo, and X- Strut. After a twirler has been named Miss Majorette of their state, they will advance to compete for the title of Miss Majorette of America in their division. 

Every year, the [[ESPN Wide World of Sports]] hosts [http://www.twirlmania.com Twirlmania] international championship competition at [[Walt Disney World]]. Competition is available for soloists, teams, high schools, colleges, and recreational groups of any age or gender. Some countries that have participated in the past include U.S, Japan, Russia, Australia, and England. Competing ranges from baton twirling to pompom and dance. Competitors also get to march in a Disney parade as well as participate in a fun, family oriented weekend. Awards range from trophies to plush stuffed animals to cash (up to $4,000) and gifts by sponsors. Some categories include Dance Line Team, Collegiate Team, Pom Pom Team, Drill Team, Basic &amp; Military, and Miss Twirl Mania Pageant, to name a few.

The main events at the first World Baton Twirling Championships were Freestyle and Compulsory Moves. Two new events were introduced: Teams (1981) and Pairs (1993). In 2005, a Short Program replaced the Compulsory Moves for the Senior Men and Women's divisions.&lt;ref name=WBTF-history /&gt; 

The World Championships have the following events:
*Freestyle Senior Women &amp; Men
*Junior Women and Men 
*Event accompanied by a compulsory/short programme event
**strut
**solo
**dancetwirl
**pairs
**trios
**show choir
*Single baton, 2 batons, 3 batons

Teams, pairs, trios, and show choir can be co-ed.

For several years, the powerhouse countries (France, Italy, Japan, and the United States) have dominated the world championships. In order to promote more events and other smaller countries' ability to have international champions, the International Cup was introduced. Athletes are categorized into B level athletes, A level athletes, and elite. The power house countries don't take B level athletes so as to the give the smaller countries an opportunity to have international champions. Because every country doesn't have dancetwirl as an event, and because of the variety within the freestyle event, the artistic twirl was introduced to replace freestyle and dancetwirl at the International Cup.

Since 2005, the two competitions have been run concurrently over a week. In 2009, the competitions began running separately, with the International Cup falling on uneven years and the World Championships on even years. New events such as Freestyle and Pairs across different age levels and divisions were added to the International Cup.

The following cities have previously hosted the competitions:

Redcoat is the name given to frontline staff at [[Butlins]] [[holiday camp]]s in the UK. A Redcoat has duties ranging from adult entertainer or children's entertainer to [[Stewardship|stewarding]].

==History==
[[File:Holiday Camp Gets Going Again- Everyday Life at a Butlin's Holiday Camp, Filey, Yorkshire, England, UK, 1945 D25923.jpg|left|thumb|Redcoats at Butlins [[Filey]] in 1947]]

The first Redcoat was [[Norman Bradford (Entertainer)|Norman Bradford]]. When Sir [[Billy Butlin]] opened his first Butlins in [[Skegness]] he realised that his guests were not engaging with activities in the way he had envisioned, most kept to themselves, and others looked bored. He asked Norman (who was engaged as an engineer constructing the camp) to take on the duty of entertaining the guests which he did with a series of ice breakers and jokes. By the end of the night the camp was buzzing and the Butlins atmosphere was born.

The same night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he would require an army of people to carry out the same job as Norman, and the role of Redcoat was formed.&lt;ref name="Butlins1"&gt;{{citation |title=Butlins Memories -Redcoats|url=http://www.butlinsmemories.com/other/redcoats.htm |publisher=Butlinsmemories.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear|left}}

===Uniform===
[[File:2 Redcoats at Butlin's Minehead March 2011.jpg|thumb|Redcoats with former England football player George Cohen, March 2011]]
To make his new army stand out, Butlin asked Norman to purchase a uniform. Norman later returned with a jacket in the camp colours of, blue, primrose yellow and white; however, Butlin found the look to be too authoritarian and decided they should wear red [[blazer]]s with white lapels and the '''Redcoat''' uniform was born. The first uniforms were made by Billie Ditchfield who became one of the first two female Redcoats (the other was Kay Berry).

Over the years the uniform has changed several times, but has always retained the core component of a red blazer (despite a proposal to replace them with red jumpsuits in the 1970s).&lt;ref name="Butlins1" /&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, braid and badges were added to the blazers. Famous designers such as [[Jeff Banks]] and [[Zandra Rhodes]] have redesigned the uniforms. To mark Butlins' 75th anniversary, the uniform was re-designed very similar to the original design consisting of Red Blazer with dark braiding and a badge with the letters "BHC" on (standing for "Butlins Holiday Camps") and white trousers or skirt. This uniform was worn throughout 2011 for the anniversary celebration, and from early 2016 it has once again become the permanent redcoat uniform.

=== Recruitment and training ===
[[File:Female redcoat March 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A female Redcoat wearing pleated white skirt, March 2011]]

The Redcoats undergo a tough selection process. Despite this they are still paid only [[minimum wage]] and members of the 'triple threat' cast team (such as the skyline gang) are paid more. Recruitment roadshows are held nationally on a yearly basis. In these Roadshows Prospective Redcoats have to show customer service and guest facing skills (contrary to the popular belief that they need to be able to sing and dance, which is no longer the case).&lt;ref name="Guardian1"&gt;{{citation |title=Could you be a Redcoat?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2006/nov/03/couldyoubearedcoat|work=The Guardian |location=London|first=Ed|last=Ewing|date=3 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WeAreButlins1"&gt;{{citation |title=Redcoat Auditions|url=http://www.wearebutlins.com/redcoataudition/|publisher=WeArebutlins }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roles===
Redcoats work in three areas, General duties, the Kid's Club and the costume character team. General duties are similar to those of a tour rep in a resort – Butlins even describe the role as "The Original Holiday Rep"&lt;ref name="WeAreButlins1" /&gt; In the evening the Redcoats form part of the live entertainment team, starring in Gangshows and ''[[X-Factor]]'' style game shows.&lt;ref name="Guardian1" /&gt; Throughout the years, Redcoats have been expected to lead ballroom dances, stage and judge competitions, and steward theatrical performances as well as meeting and greeting guests in public areas. Redcoats run the children's clubs which provide sporting activities, competitions and arts and crafts. Each redcoat will have many different roles to fulfil in any given week.&lt;ref name="Butlins1" /&gt;

==Similar staff==
{{further|Holiday camp#Frontline staff}}

Butlins remained the largest holiday camp chain in the UK, but smaller camps copied the redcoat style of staffing. In the 1960s, Fred Pontin adopted the Bluecoat to represent at [[Pontins]] holiday camps,&lt;ref name="Pontins1"&gt;{{citation |title=Butlins Memories – Pontins|url=http://www.butlinsmemories.com/pontins/index.htm|publisher=butlinsmemories.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at some point, Harry Warner decided [[Warner Leisure Hotels|Warners]]' holiday camps should adopt the Greencoat.

==Media appearances==
The ITV series [[Redcoats (tv series)|''Redcoats'']] was a docusoap following the lives of Redcoats at Butlins [[Minehead]] and [[Bognor Regis|Bognor]] resorts. Over three series of 30-minute episodes, it shows the selection process, the Redcoats entertaining the visitors and life behind the scenes. The series was made by Pilgrim Productions.&lt;ref name="Pilgrim"&gt;{{citation|title=Redcoats|url=http://www.pilgrimproductions.co.uk/projredcoats.htm|publisher=Pilgrim Productions|access-date=28 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109054234/http://www.pilgrimproductions.co.uk/projredcoats.htm#|archive-date=9 January 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In fiction===
The BBC television series ''[[Hi-de-Hi!]]'', written by former Butlins employees [[Jimmy Perry]] (a Redcoat) and [[David Croft (TV producer)|David Croft]] (summer show actor),&lt;ref name="DavidCroft1"&gt;{{citation |title=Croft and Perry|url=http://www.davidcroft.co.uk/Croft-Perry/|publisher=davidcroft.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; featured the Yellowcoats as a fictional analogue. The title of the show ''"Hi-de-Hi"'' originated with Norman Bradford who claimed to have taken it from an American film; he began using this as a cheer to which the audience spontaneously responded "Ho-de-ho".&lt;ref name="NotebookNews1"&gt;{{citation|title=Butlins at Clacton, a History of the Man and the Holiday Camp|url=http://notebooknews.co.uk/Clactononsea/Butlins3.html|publisher=notebooknews.co.uk|access-date=28 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823102156/http://notebooknews.co.uk/Clactononsea/Butlins3.html#|archive-date=23 August 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Citizen82"&gt;{{citation|title=Citizen 82 [Programme 2]|url=http://www.macearchive.org/Media.html?Title=538|publisher=Central Television|access-date=28 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513191247/http://www.macearchive.org/Media.html?Title=538#|archive-date=13 May 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another BBC television series, ''[[Doctor Who]]'', featured an episode entitled ''[[Delta and the Bannermen]]'', which depicted an alien attack on the fictitious Shangri-La holiday camp (in reality the Butlins camp at [[Barry Island (holiday camp)|Barry Island]]). As with the real camp, Shangri-La was staffed with Redcoats played by extras.&lt;ref name="DrWho1"&gt;{{citation |title=Delta and the Bannermen|url=http://www.mentalis.co.uk/sylvester-mccoy/delta-and-the-bannermen.aspx|publisher=mentalis.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable former Redcoats==
A number of entertainers have been Redcoats in the early stages of their careers. Becoming a Redcoat is seen as a way into show business, as it allows a performer to become established as a professional for the purposes of joining the [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]] trade union which then allows the performer to work freely throughout the industry. In exceptional cases a Redcoat may even become notable whilst in the employment of Butlins; [[Stephen Mulhern]] notably performed on the [[Royal Variety Performance]] in 1997 whilst still working as a Redcoat,&lt;ref name="DailyMail1"&gt;{{citation |title=In-taxi with Stephen Mulhern|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-1174331/In-taxi--Stephen-Mulhern.html|work=Daily Mail|location=London|first=Benji|last=Wilson|date=2 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the past notable singers have had chart hits. [[Clinton Ford (singer)|Clinton Ford]], for instance, reached number 27 in 1959 with "[[Old Shep]]" just after completing his final summer season at [[Penychain (holiday camp)|Pwllheli]]. However, prior to this in 1957 [[Russ Hamilton (singer)|Russ Hamilton]] recorded a number 2 hit in the UK "We Will Make Love" (held off the top spot by [[Elvis Presley]] and "[[All Shook Up]]"). Shortly after this he recorded a number 4 hit in the US Billboard with the song "Rainbow", and all the time Hamilton continued to entertain Butlins guests. It was Billy Butlin himself who asked Hamilton to record "We Will Make Love" for the benefit of Butlins guests.&lt;ref name="Independant1"&gt;{{citation |title=Russ Hamilton: Liverpudlian singer-songwriter who had a hit in America years before the Beatles|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/russ-hamilton-liverpudlian-singersongwriter-who-had-a-hit-in-america-years-before-the-beatles-964176.html|work=The Independent|location=London|date=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artists have gone on to find success building on the skills they learned as a Redcoat, such as [[Des O'Connor]], [[Jimmy Tarbuck]], and [[Michael Barrymore]].&lt;ref name="BBC6"&gt;{{citation |title=Famous faces launched at Butlins|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4886610.stm|publisher=The BBC|date=11 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role is an important part of the entertainment and tourism culture of the United Kingdom, and even today former Redcoats are regularly identified in the press and in books by this role even though it may only have been a small part of their career.

Other famous Redcoats include [[Ted Rogers (comedian)|Ted Rogers]], a comedian best known as the presenter of the variety/game show ''[[3-2-1]]'', and Northern Irish entertainer [[Jimmy Cricket]].

[[File:Casting Cats.jpg|thumb|Casting call for [[black cat]]s, Los Angeles, 1961. The studio was seeking cats for the [[Roger Corman]] movie ''[[Tales of Terror]].'']]

In the [[performing arts]] industry such as [[theatre]], [[film]], or [[television]], a '''casting''' (or '''casting call''') is a [[pre-production]] process for selecting a certain type of [[actor]], [[dancer]], [[singer]], or [[extra (acting)|extra]] for a particular role or part in a script, [[screenplay]], or [[teleplay]]. This process is typically utilized for a motion picture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motion Pictures|url=https://socialbilitty.com/glossary/motion-pictures/|date=December 14, 2016|publisher=''[[Socialbilitty]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006161746/https://socialbilitty.com/glossary/motion-pictures/|archivedate=October 6, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[television program]], [[documentary]], [[music video]], [[play (theatre)|play]], or [[television advertisement]], etc. This involvement in a dramatic production, [[advertisement]], and or [[industrial video]] is intended for an [[audience]], or [[studio audience]].

==Casting process==
The casting process involves a series of [[audition (performing arts)|audition]]s before a casting panel, composed of individuals within a [[theatrical production]] such as [[theatrical producer]], and [[theater director]]. However, within a given [[Television program#Production|television production]] a casting panel can consist of a [[television producer]], or within [[filmmaking|film production]] a casting panel could contain a [[film producer]], [[film director]], and/or [[choreographer]]. Usually, in nearly all areas of [[show business]], a casting director&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Does a Casting Director Do?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kate-mcclanaghan/what-does-a-casting-direc_b_9799558.html|date=Apr 29, 2017|publisher=''[[Huffington Post]]''|access-date=May 21, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170526020009/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kate-mcclanaghan/what-does-a-casting-direc_b_9799558.html|archivedate=May 26, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is on this panel as well. In the early stages of this process [[performers]] often may present, or are presented with prepared ''audition pieces'' such as [[monologue]]s, [[song]]s, choreography, scripts and or sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sides|url=http://dictionary.tdf.org/sides/|date=Feb 25, 2015|publisher=''[[Theatre Development Fund ]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517122705/http://dictionary.tdf.org/sides/|archivedate=May 17, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These audition pieces are usually video taped, typically in the form of [[screen test]]s and then attached with resumes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How do I add my resume and more information about myself?|url=https://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?proaddresume|date=May 21, 2017|publisher=''[[IMDb]]''|access-date=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[head shot]]s and or viewed online via websites such as [[IMDb]], then shared with film producers, film directors and or [[studio executive]]s. Later stages may involve groups of [[actors]] both union, ([[SAG-AFTRA]]) and non union depending on the size and scope of the production, attempting to read material from the work under consideration, paired off in various combinations of two, three or more. With each of the actor's overall [[motivational]] choices evaluated, the casting panel considers both the individual actor, and the ''chemistry'' created from either one of the combinations set forth within the [[read-through]], such as boy meets girl, etc.

Within the production of a prestigious work under consideration for film or television, and depending on the difficulty in finding a lead or supporting actor for the role, such as with the casting of the [[biopics|biopic]] films Notorious,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notorious|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472198/|date=January 16, 2009|publisher=''[[IMDb ]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512175935/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472198/|archivedate=May 12, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straight Outta Compton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Straight Outta Compton - Number One Movie of the Summer|url=https://socialbilitty.com/2015/08/straight-outta-compton-number-one-movie-of-the-summer/|date=August 20, 2015|publisher=''[[Socialbilitty]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307235934/https://socialbilitty.com/2015/08/straight-outta-compton-number-one-movie-of-the-summer/|archivedate=March 7, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and All Eyez on Me,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Eyez on Me|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1666185/|date=June 16, 2017|publisher=''[[IMDb ]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519114240/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1666185/|archivedate=May 19, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; casting calls may go out into the general public at large, this is referred to as a Cattle Call&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cattle Call|url=https://socialbilitty.com/glossary/cattle-call/|date=December 15, 2016|publisher=''[[Socialbilitty]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213081649/https://socialbilitty.com/glossary/cattle-call/|archivedate=February 13, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (typical for [[community theater]]), to professional and semi-professional local actors where a similar process is followed (for supporting roles in [[theater]] and [[film]]) or for specifically selected actors (for leading roles, especially in films).

Casting character breakdowns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Write a Casting Notice|url=https://www.lightsfilmschool.com/blog/how-to-write-a-casting-call/481|date=April 2, 2013|publisher=''[[Lights Film School]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321022431/http://www.lightsfilmschool.com/blog/how-to-write-a-casting-call/481/|archivedate=March 21, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; not to be confused with [[script breakdown]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Script Breakdown 101|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMep2s_T89c|date=Feb 18, 2016|publisher=''[[YouTube]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225024006/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMep2s_T89c|archivedate=December 25, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are often provided by production agents who submit their clients to casting, which provides a brief summary of character (age, gender, race or ethnicity, situations they may be involved in). A more robust version of this painstaking task can be made through the Breakdown Services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breakdown Services|url=https://www.breakdownservices.com/|date=May 18, 2017|publisher=''[[Breakdown Services]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517203341/http://www.breakdownservices.com/|archivedate=May 17, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was founded by former actor Gary Marsh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Headshot Cafe interview with Gary Marsh (founder of Breakdown Services)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwqFMEPVTpk|date=Jul 8, 2013|publisher=''[[YouTube]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510155907/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwqFMEPVTpk|archivedate=May 10, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Breakdown Services|url=https://breakdownservices.com/index.cfm/main/about|date=May 18, 2017|publisher=''[[Breakdown Services]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522044320/http://breakdownservices.com/index.cfm/main/about|archivedate=May 22, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 40 years ago. This was due to the difficult logistics issues for agents to get their actors submitted for acting roles from [[major film studio]]s and casting directors.

This casting breakdown service provides a complete character breakdown of various scripts and projects from production companies for film, television, [[print modeling|modeling]], commercials etc., to only agencies and managers who meet certain criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How can we contact casting directors or film directors in Hollywood as an aspiring actor?|url=https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-contact-casting-directors-or-film-directors-in-Hollywood-as-an-aspiring-actor/answer/Shaunti-Griffin?srid=hDjAD|date=May 12, 2017|publisher=''[[Quora]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These agents and managers are positioned all over the world, and subscribe to this service that literally has an entire suite of services for just about every aspect of the breakdown, for a monthly service subscription fee. This suite includes services such as Breakdown Express,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breakdown Express|url=https://www.breakdownexpress.com/index.cfm|date=May 18, 2017|publisher=''[[Breakdown Express ]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515155826/http://breakdownexpress.com/index.cfm|archivedate=May 15, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which offer representatives, casting and those who subscribe, a quicker way to post projects themselves. Another more limited version of the breakdown service, also for a monthly subscription fee is called Actors Access&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Actors Access|url=http://www.actorsaccess.com/|date=May 18, 2017|publisher=''[[Actors Access]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170520075705/http://www.actorsaccess.com/|archivedate=May 20, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where acting can subscribe to what is only made available to them, more like an entry level acting position, like [[under-five]], or a [[bit part]], a great tool for the actor whom is without an agent or manager.

An actor may go through several casting calls before receiving a part, and even though well known actors or actresses oftentimes still go through this very necessary process, some are privileged enough to have well known [[writer]]s, [[screenwriter]]s and or directors /producers [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] a project for their intent to be cast in a role. The well known actor or actress oftentimes negotiates producer [[Credit (creative arts)|credit]] as well as very lucrative monetary compensation.

Independent casting studios like Film Independent who hosts the annual [[Independent Spirit Awards]] and the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]] are often utilized for casting calls so that auditions can take place in one location, as well as possible affiliated various locations saving valuable time, energy and money. 

===What Casting Directors Actually Do===

For some major productions, the process of selecting actors for sometimes hundreds of speaking parts and roles, may often require a specialized staff. While the last word remains with the people in charge such as the director, producer, artistic departments and overall production team, a '''casting director'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twinkie Byrd - Casting in the 21st Century|url=https://socialbilitty.com/2017/03/twinkie-byrd-casting-in-the-21st-century/|date=March 24, 2017|publisher=''[[Socialbilitty]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214074029/https://socialbilitty.com/2017/03/twinkie-byrd-casting-in-the-21st-century/|archivedate=December 14, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "CD" (and sometimes the casting associate) is in charge of most of the daily work involved in this process during [[pre-production]]. A casting director is sometimes assisted by a casting associate; productions with large numbers of extras may have their own extras casting director as well, however in all aspects of a film or television production's budget, they are all a part of the [[Above-the-line (filmmaking)|above-the-line]], answering to the director as part of his or her staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Job Descriptions for Film, Video &amp; Cgi|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Job_Descriptions_for_Film_Video_Cgi.html?id=gv8MAAAACAAJ&amp;hl=en|date=May 21, 2017|publisher=''[[Google Books]]''|access-date=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "CD" remains as a liaison between director, actors and their agents/managers and the studio/network to get the [[character (arts)|character]]s in the script cast. Some casting directors build an impressive career working on numerous [[Hollywood]] productions such as [[Marion Dougherty]], [[Mary Jo Slater]], [[Mary Selway]], [[Lynn Stalmaster]], [[April Webster]], [[Tammara Billik]], [[Marci Liroff]], [[Avy Kaufman]], [[Mindy Marin]], and [[Robi Reed]].

At least in the early stages of casting and or extras casting such as with casting agency [[Central Casting]], the process may be decentralized geographically, often in conjunction with actual shooting planned in different locations. Another reason may be tapping into each home market in the case of an [[international co-production]]. However, for the top parts, the choice of one or more beautiful people, whose presence is of enormous commercial importance, may rather follow strictly personal channels, e.g. direct contact with the director. During this time known as the "attachment phase" of a film, the casting director's job is to send out copies of the current script to agents for what is known as coverage. Coverage is when a script yet to be cast is read, summarized into a one-pager, and a brief set of character descriptions established. At this time, if an agency agrees to give coverage to a film, they will submit a list of ideas to the casting directors of actors available, capable, and in the price range of the film. Also, casting directors create their own&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/182731144|title=Self-management for actors : getting down to (show) business|last=Bonnie.|first=Gillespie,|date=2009|publisher=Cricket Feet Pub|isbn=9780972301992|edition=3rd |location=Los Angeles, CA|oclc=182731144}}&lt;/ref&gt; idea lists and can "check avails" or call the actor representation to see if they are available and interested in taking on potential projects. If an idea that is generated from a casting director and a subsequent avail check or from an agent's recommendation is "approved" by the director, producers, and financiers (or studio), the casting director sends out what is called an "Offer." The offer, usually contains a letter to the actor's representative explaining the role in question, a copy of the script, why the actor has been selected, the length of time commitment, the approximate start date of filming, the filming location, and the proposed salary offering. If the actor does not respond to the material or for whatever reason cannot accept the job, they respond to casting with what is called a "pass." If they accept the offer, the agent engages the casting director and a deal memo is sent from casting to the representative. It is at this time when negotiations between agency and production happen to finalize any deal points before the entertainment lawyers step in and draw up the attachment contracts. If this process happens very early on in the development of a movie but the official shoot dates and details are not yet known, a Letter of Intent or "LOI" is drafted, to indicate, if and when the project is "green lit" or begins active production, the actor is already hired to portray that particular role. 

After the attachment phase is complete (which depends on many factors -- including but not limited to: financial backers, studio heads, availability of other above the line personnel), the physical auditions begin for all of the remaining roles. During this time, depending on the budget of the film, they could have what is called "pre-screens" where you audition only for a casting director (or associate) to see if the actor is right for the material. After pre-screens would be a "director session", during this time the actor comes in and auditions (usually with the same material) and now performs for the casting director and the film director. If there is a next step, it is usually a "callback" or producer session, where anyone who has decision making power is in the room for your audition. In television, this phase is referred to as a "screen test" and Network Executives would also be in attendance.  Once actors are selected from the pool of available actors, the same booking process that happens in the attachment phase takes place for any actor except extras.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

The resulting list of actors who were selected to play a [[Character (arts)|character]] for a production, is called a [[cast list]], which is incorporated into a [[production company]]'s [[daily call sheet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Call Sheet on a film production?|url=https://www.pinterest.com/pin/AdHVgcm6ShVa0O6QBzSKUyej3F9s9hbwxymib5y-vI4CPDpfvYfevQI/|date=September 8, 2016|publisher=''[[Pinterest]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reflected in the projects [[title sequence]] especially with film and television.

=== Casting Office Personnel ===
'''Readers:''' This person reads all other character's lines opposite the actor who is currently auditioning. A good reader is someone who has acting skills, but who has no interest in booking a role through that casting director's office at that time. A reader will know how to give and take and play with other actors without ever outshining the auditioning actors.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; 

'''Interns:''' Interns are more common to commercial casting offices which host as many as a dozen different casting directors holding different auditions per day. While some commercial casting offices hold permanent casting space, many rent out studios on a project to project basis. A key intern will work with many busy casting directors sorting mail, copying sides and transcribing them onto "cue cards" or large boards to be read off of as prompts in the casting room, help actors sign in, and keep the flow of actors going in and out of the casting room as smooth as possible.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

'''Casting Assistants:''' This is the entry level position in the field of casting. These people go above and beyond the call of duty of your typical office assistant. They do everything from covering phones, to making copies, setting up audition (aka "session") equipment like lights, the camera, sound equipment, etc. They sometimes can be found in the office relaying audition appointments, checking actors avails, or in the casting room making sure the recording software is running smoothly so the Casting Director can focus on each actor's performance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

'''Casting Associates:''' Associates is the second [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] in a casting office. Once a casting associate has worked for two years in the field of casting, they can apply for membership in [[Casting Society of America]]. Typically, the work under a Casting Director running pre-read sessions, prepping deal memos, and doing any calls to agents. Many associates begin to take on smaller scale projects so they can amass enough credits to move up in rank in CSA to a full-fledged Casting Director.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Casting Director:''' Their job is to know a lot about a lot of actors, so that they can advise and present to the director the best of the existing possibilities. Casting directors are highly influential and is usually on the project because the director trusts their judgements. They are also the ones who decides who the director does see. Good casting directors "discover" actor by carefully setting it up so that the director and producer will feel as if they've made the discovery of the new young actor. On the occasion when the director or producer does not respond to the actor presented, they must keep in mind that they aren't directing the production, the director is the one who's going to have to work with that actor-- therefore, it is casting's responsibility to delicately balance between showcasing the actor available to them and the director and producer's sensibilities, tastes, and expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47813908|title=Audition : everything an actor needs to know to get the part|last=Michael.|first=Shurtleff,|date=1980|orig-year=1978|publisher=Bantam Books|isbn=0553272950|edition=Bantam |location=New York|oclc=47813908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Casting Society of America]] (CSA)===
The significant organization of professional screen, television, reality, and theater casting in the US is the [[Casting Society of America]] (CSA), but membership is optional.  Casting directors organized in 2005 and became members of a collective bargaining unit, the [https://www.ht399.org/ Hollywood Teamsters Local 399] and [https://teamster.org/locals/local-817 New York Teamsters Local 817].

=== [[Artios Awards]] ===
The highest honor a casting director can receive is awarded by their peers in the [[Casting Society of America]]. ''Artios'', comes from the Greek word meaning, "perfectly fitted." The Artios award excellence in casting for all genres of casting except commercials. The Artios are currently held mid-January annually with ceremonies in New York, Los Angeles, and (beginning in 2018) London. Since their incarnation in 1985, they were held in November but were moved in 2013-2014 season to align with the rest of the film and television industry's awards season. The Artios is awarded to those CSA members who receive primary screen (or program) credit for casting on the winning project. Location Casting Directors, Casting Executives and Department Heads who are CSA members and who receive credit on winning projects also receive an Artios Award. CSA Associates on those projects are recognized in the press and with a certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.castingsociety.com/awards/artios|title=Artios Awards|website=www.castingsociety.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102213058/http://www.castingsociety.com/awards/artios|archivedate=2013-11-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Emmy Awards ===
The [[Emmy Awards]] has a category for casting directors. As of 2017, Junie Lowry-Johnson has won the most casting Emmys as an individual, all in the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series|drama category]]. She has six awards for her work on ''[[NYPD Blue]]'', ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', ''[[True Blood]]'' and ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]''. The only shows to win casting Emmys three times were ''[[30 Rock]]'' and ''[[Veep]]'', both in the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series|comedy category]]. In 2017, at the [[69th Primetime Emmy Awards]], the [[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] introduced the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Casting for a Reality Program]].

{{original research|date=April 2018}}
A '''chess clock''' consists of two adjacent [[clock]]s with buttons to stop one clock while starting the other, so that the two clocks never run simultaneously. Chess clocks are used in chess and other two-player [[game]]s where the players move in turn. The purpose is to keep track of the total time each player takes for their own moves, and ensure that neither player overly delays the game.

Chess clocks were first used extensively in tournament [[chess]], and are often called '''game clocks'''.  The first time that game clocks were used in a chess tournament was in the [[London 1883 chess tournament|London 1883 tournament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Goldene Schachzeiten: Erinnerungen |last=Vidmar |first=Milan |authorlink=Milan Vidmar |coauthors= |year=1960 |publisher=W. de Gruyter |location= |isbn=3-11-002095-5|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their use has since spread to tournament [[Scrabble]], [[shogi]], [[Go (board game)|go]], and nearly every competitive two-player [[board game]], as well as other types of games. 
In a tournament, the arbiter typically places all clocks in the same orientation, so that they can easily assess games that need attention at later stages.

The simplest [[time control]] is "sudden death", in which players must make a predetermined number of moves in a certain amount of time or forfeit the game immediately.
A particularly popular variant in informal play is [[blitz chess]], in which each player is given a short time (e.g. five minutes) on the clock in which to play the entire game.

The players may take more or less time over any individual move. The opening moves in chess are often played quickly due to their familiarity, which leaves the players more time to consider more complex and unfamiliar positions later. It is not unusual in slow chess games for a player to leave the table, but the clock of the absent player continues to run if it is their turn, or starts to run if their opponent makes a move.

== Analog game clocks ==
[[File:Garde-chess-clock.jpg|thumb|A typical analog chess clock]]

[[Analog clock]]s are equipped with a "flag" that falls to indicate the exact moment the player's time has expired. Analog clocks use mechanical buttons. Pressing the button on one player's side physically stops the movement of that player's clock and releases the hold on the opponent's.

The drawbacks of the mechanical clocks include accuracy and matching of the two clocks, and matching of the indicators (flags) of time expiration. Additional time cannot easily be added for more complex time controls, especially those that call for an increment or delay on every move, such as some forms of [[byoyomi]]. However, a malfunctioning analog clock is a less serious event than a malfunctioning digital clock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://main.uschess.org/content/view/7328/28/ |title= FAQ (Starting Out) - Learn About Chess |accessdate=2008-01-19 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date=1999-11-30 |work= |publisher=United States Chess Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early development of digital game clocks==
[[File:Modern Day Chess Clocks.jpg|thumb|Modern day chess clocks.]]
In 1973, to address the issues with analog clocks, '''Bruce Cheney''', a [[Cornell University]] Electrical Engineering student and chess player, created the first digital chess clock as a project for an undergraduate EE course.&lt;ref&gt;"Early Bird", ''[[Chess Life]]'', April 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical of most inventions, it was crude compared to the products on the market many years later and was limited by the technology that existed at the time. For example, the display was done with red LEDs. LEDs require significant power, and as a result, the clock had to be plugged into a wall outlet. The high cost of LEDs at the time meant that only one set of digits could be displayed, that of the player whose turn it was to move. This meant that each player's time had to be multiplexed to the display when their time was running. In 1973, LSI chips were not readily or cheaply available, so all the multiplexing and logic were done using chips that consisted of four two-input [[Transistor–transistor_logic|TTL NAND gates]], which resulted in excessive power consumption. Being plugged into the wall is obviously a major drawback, but had one advantage: the timebase for the clock was driven off of a rectified version of 60 cycle AC current. Each player had a separate counter, and, in a parallel to the original mechanical architecture, one player's counter was disabled while the other's was running. The clock only had one mode: time ran forward. It could be reset, but not set. It did not count the number of moves. But it successfully addressed the original goals of the project (accurate and matched timing).

The first commercially available digital chess clock was patented in 1975 by '''Joseph Meshi''' and '''Jeffrey R. Ponsor''' and sold as the Micromate-80.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=4062180 |status=patent |title=Electronic chess clock |gdate= 1977-12-13 |fdate= 1975-07-31 |invent1= Meshi, Joseph |invent2= Ponsor, Jeffrey R.}}; filed July 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later a much-improved Micromate-180 was produced alongside Meshi's MBA Thesis, "Demand Analysis for a New Product (The Digital Chess Clock)", at [[San Diego State University]], while Meshi and Ponsor continued to develop digital gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=4247925 |status=patent |title=Game microcomputer |gdate= 1981-01-27 |fdate= 1978-07-13 |invent1= Meshi, Joseph |invent2= Ponsor, Jeffrey R.}}; filed January 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fischer clock and related designs {{anchor|Fischer clock}}==
[[Image:Olimpiada Bled Slovenija deska.jpg|thumb|Digital chess clock connected to a board that automatically senses when moves have been made]]
Digital clocks and Internet gaming have spurred a wave of experimentation with more varied and complex time controls than the traditional standards. [[Time control]] is commonly used in modern chess in many different [[Time control#Methodology|methodologies]]. One particularly notable development, which has gained quite wide acceptance in chess, was proposed by former world champion [[Bobby Fischer]], who in 1988 filed for {{US patent|4,884,255}} (awarded in 1989) for a new type of digital chess clock.  Fischer's digital clock gave each player a fixed period of time at the start of the game and then added a small amount after each move. Joseph Meshi called this "Accumulation" as it was a main feature of his patented Micromate-180 (US Patent 4,247,925 1978). This became the linchpin of Fischer's clock patented 10 years later. In this way, the players would never be desperately short of time. 

The increment time control was first used in the privately organised [[Fischer–Spassky (1992 match)|1992 Fischer–Spassky match]], and quickly became popular in the wider chess world, and was used in the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://theweekinchess.com/html/twic161.html The Week in Chess 161], [[The Week in Chess]], 8-Dec-1997&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017 most top level tournaments use Fischer's system as well as an increasing number of lower level tournaments. Other aspects of Fischer's patent, such as a synthesized voice announcing how much time the players have, thus eliminating the need for them to keep looking at the clock, have not been adopted.

On March 10, 1994, a patent application was filed by inventors Frank A. Camaratta Jr. of Huntsville, Alabama, and William Goichberg of Salisbury Mills, New York, for a game timer especially suitable for playing the game of chess, which employed a "delay" feature. The game timer provides, among other features, a user-definable delay between the time the activation button is pressed and the time that the activated clock actually begins to count down. United States Patent 5,420,830 was issued on May 10, 1995, and subsequently assigned to the United States Chess Federation by the inventors. As with the Fischer clock, the benefit of the delay clock is to reduce the likelihood that a player with positional and/or material superiority will lose a match solely because of the expiration of time on that player's time clock. Delay is still popular in the U.S, although increment is becoming more popular in the US.

==Timing methods==
{{main article|Time control}}

There are three main types of chess timing methods, two of which are mathematically equivalent: (1) ''Increment'' (invented by [[Bobby Fischer]]), (2) ''Bronstein delay'' (invented by [[David Bronstein]]), and (3) ''Simple delay''.

* Increment (also known as Fischer and bonus)&amp;mdash;a specified amount of time is added for each move. For example, if the increment is thirty seconds, each player gets an additional thirty seconds for each move. Under FIDE and US Chess rules you get the increment for move one as well. For example, for G/3;inc2 (three minutes of base time with a two second increment each move), you start with three minutes and two seconds on the first move. Not all digital chess clocks automatically give the increment for move one and thus for those that don't, the increment time has to be added manually to be base time so each player gets the increment for move one. 
* Bronstein delay&amp;mdash;this timing method adds time but unlike increment not always the maximum amount of time is added. If a player expends more than the specified delay, then the entire delay is added to the player's clock but if a player moves faster than the delay, only the exact amount of time expended by the player is added. For example, if the delay is ten seconds and a player uses ten or more seconds for a move, ten seconds is added after they complete their move. If the player uses five seconds for a move, five seconds is added after they complete their move. This ensures that the base time left on the clock can never increase even if a player makes fast moves. As with increment, you get the delay time for move one under FIDE and US Chess rules. 
* Simple delay (also known as countdown delay and US delay)&amp;mdash;with this timing method, the clock waits for the delay period each move before starting to subtract the player's base time.  For example, if the delay is ten seconds, the clock waits for ten seconds each move before the base time starts going down. This timing method is mathematically equivalent to Bronstein delay. Simple delay is the form of delay most often used in the US.

A '''chew toy''' is a [[toy]] designed to be chewed by animals for purposes of stimulation and relief from boredom .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dogproofball.com/5477815.html Dog chew toy (United States Patent 5477815)]&lt;/ref&gt; The act of gnawing on a chew toy is meant to be soothing and to assist small animals, like puppies, in event of easing the pain when breaking in their adult teeth as the chewing process releases feel-good chemicals from the brain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dogproofball.com/how-to-prevent-puppy-chewing-problems How to Prevent Puppy Chewing Problems]&lt;/ref&gt; There are several different types of chew toys, including [[Rawhide (textile)|rawhide]], [[wood]], [[paper]] and [[mineral]].  Chew toys are commonly associated with [[puppies]] and [[dog]]s, though they are also used for [[bird]]s, [[rodent]]s, and [[rabbit]]s.

Chew toys are a vital part of a happy, healthy animal's life.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In addition to providing hours of entertainment, they also allow the animal to work out anxiety and boredom by being occupied with chewing a toy.  Chew toys also distract small animals from chewing on other "forbidden" items, and they assist in maintaining healthy teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveningsun.com/ci_12162339|title=Use chew toys, leash to help train puppies|last=Lynn Smith|first=Chandra|date=2009-04-19|publisher=The Evening Sun|accessdate=2009-05-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903211938/http://www.eveningsun.com/ci_12162339|archivedate=2009-09-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar toy called a [[Teether]] is also given to human children as a soothing tool to help soothe inflamed gums during teething.

==Rawhide==
[[File:Dog with rawhide chew toy.jpg|thumb|right|A dog with a rawhide chew toy.]]
[[Rawhide (textile)|Rawhide]] chew toys are most often associated with puppies and dogs, though rawhide toys are plentiful in the bird toy section of most pet stores. Rawhide is suitable for all animals except [[herbivores]], as it is made of animal skin. Rabbits, which only eat vegetation, cannot have rawhide toys because their digestive systems cannot process them. This is a rather sturdy kind of chew toy and it can take months for a small animal or bird to destroy.  Examples of rawhide chew toys are twists and rawhide bones. Chew toys made of leather are not recommended for dogs as they cannot be properly digested in the stomach and may cause blockage in the intestines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parent |first=Lucia E. |authorlink= |author2=Lucia Roesel-Parent |editor= |others= |title=Beagles: Everything about Purchase, Care, Nutrition, Handling, and |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yKxxFgRbz74C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=%22dog+toy%22+leather&amp;lr=&amp;sig=xSXCcsMpGIpgHpvnLCTSWrOzAxE |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=2003 |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |location= |language= |isbn=0-7641-2002-6 |oclc= |doi= |id=  |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=|page=23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wood==
[[Wood]] chew toys are made of a safe, non-poisonous, softer wood and are often coated in bright, vegetable-based dyes or paints. Wooden chew toys are given in place of the wood that small animals would find in the wild. They are a safe alternative for a small animal owner to purchase if the owner has no knowledge of the trees and shrubs growing in their area. They are generally used as either small rodents toys or rabbit toys. Wooden chew toys help to keep teeth trimmed down, preventing eating difficulties in pets and unnecessary trips to a vet  for teeth clipping. An example of a wooden chew toy is the commercial product toy ropes

==Paper==
[[Paper]] chew toys are made of non bleached  non-toxic paper. They are an inexpensive, or often free, option for small pet owners and can provide hours of stimulation and play for small animals. One common paper chew toy is an empty [[toilet paper]] tube. These can double as tunnels for very small rodents, and can also be used as modified [[piñatas]] for larger small animals. Wadded up [[newspaper]] pages, old spineless books, and the commercial product ''Chubes'' are other commonly used paper chew toys.

==Mineral==
[[Mineral]] chew toys are made of flavored animal-safe minerals. These range from flavored fruit-shaped blocks for birds to ice-cream cone shaped mineral treats for rabbits. They also come shaped as bowls with fluffy minerals inside. A common mineral chew toy is the [[cuttlebone]], a toy for birds that helps to keep nails and beaks trimmed and healthy.

==Rubber==
[[File:Dog enjoying black kong toy.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A dog eating treats out of a Kong, a rubber chew toy.]]
There is a variety of [[rubber]] chew toys for dogs on the market that are molded into different shapes. Some of them are hollowed so that treats can be placed in them. This way, the dog has to "work" to get a treat. Rubber is a good chew toy for dogs but is unhealthy for small animals

'''Comics studies''' (also '''comic'''('''s''') '''art studies''', '''sequential art studies'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DQhVAAAAMAAJ&amp;q= ''International Journal of Comic Art'', volume 7], 2005, p. 574.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''graphic narrative studies''')&lt;ref&gt;Pramod K. Nayar, ''The Indian Graphic Novel: Nation, History and Critique'', Routledge, 2016, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; is an academic field that focuses on [[comics]] and [[sequential art]].  Although comics and [[graphic novel]]s have been generally dismissed as less relevant [[popular culture|pop culture]] [[Text (literary theory)|texts]], scholars in fields such as [[semiotics]], [[composition studies]] and [[cultural studies]] are now re-considering comics and graphic novels as complex texts deserving of serious scholarly study.

Not to be confused with the technical aspects of comics creation, comics studies exists only with the creation of '''comics theory'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;—which approaches comics critically as an art—and the writing of '''comics historiography'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (the study of the [[history of comics]]).&lt;ref name="Crucifix"&gt;Benoît Crucifix, [https://www.academia.edu/25698596/Redrawing_Comics_into_the_Graphic_Novel._Comics_Historiography_Canonization_and_Authors_Histories_of_the_Medium "Redrawing Comics into the Graphic Novel: Comics Historiography, Canonization, and Authors' Histories of the Medium"], "Whither comics studies?" panel, International conference of the French Association for American Studies, Toulouse (France), May 24–27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Comics theory has significant overlap with the '''philosophy of comics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, i.e., the study of the [[ontology]],&lt;ref name="Meskin"&gt;Aaron Meskin, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1747-9991.2011.00450.x/abstract;jsessionid=178329FBF825056FF0EF32CB3F3D8263.f03t01?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage= "The Philosophy of Comics"], ''Philosophy Compass'' '''6'''(12), December 2011, pp. 854–864.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Iain Thomson]], in his "Deconstructing the Hero" (in Jeff McLaughlin, ed., ''Comics as Philosophy'' (Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2005), pp. 100–129), develops the concept of comics as philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; [[epistemology]]&lt;ref&gt;Meskin, Aaron and Roy T.

Comics studies is also interrelated with '''comics criticism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, the analysis and evaluation of comics and the comics medium.&lt;ref&gt;Bramlett, Frank, Roy Cook and Aaron Meskin (eds.), ''The Routledge Companion to Comics'', Routledge, 2016, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theorizing comics==
Although there has been the occasional investigation of comics as a valid art form, specifically in [[Gilbert Seldes]]' ''The 7 Lively Arts'' (1924), Martin Sheridan's ''Classic Comics and Their Creators'' (1942), and David Kunzle's ''The Early Comic Strip: Narrative Strips and Picture Stories in the European Broadsheet from c. 1450 to 1825'' (1973), contemporary [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] comics studies in North America can be said to have burst onto the academic scene with both [[Will Eisner]]'s ''[[Comics and Sequential Art]]'' in 1985 and [[Scott McCloud]]'s ''[[Understanding Comics]]'' in 1993. [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] comics studies can trace its roots back to the work of semioticians such as [[Roland Barthes]] (particularly his 1964 essay "Rhetoric of the Image", published in English in the anthology ''Image—Music—Text'')&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Barthes]], [http://www.persee.fr/doc/comm_0588-8018_1964_num_4_1_1027 "Rhétorique de l'image"], ''Communications'' '''4'''(1), 1964, pp. 40–51, translated as "Rhetoric of the Image", in: Roland Barthes, ''Image–Music–Text'', essays selected and translated by Stephen Heath, New York 1977, pp. 32–51.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Umberto Eco]] (particularly his 1964 book ''Apocalittici e integrati'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Umberto Eco]], ''Apocalittici e integrati: comunicazioni di massa e teorie della cultura di massa'', Bompiani, 1964. Cf. also: Umberto Eco (1972). "Epilogue", in: Walter Herdeg and David Pascal (eds.): ''The Art of the Comic Strip'', Zurich: The Graphis Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, analysis of comics have begun to be undertaken by cognitive scientists, the most prominent being [[Neil Cohn]], who has used tools from linguistics to detail the theoretical structure of comics' underlying "visual language", and has also used psychological experimentation from cognitive neuroscience to test these theories in actual comprehension. This work has suggested similarities between the way that the brain processes language and the way it processes sequential images.&lt;ref&gt;[[Neil Cohn]], ''The Visual Language of Comics: Introduction to the Structure and Cognition of Sequential Images'', London: Bloomsbury, 2013, p. 1[[wikt:ff.#Abbreviation|ff.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Cohn's theories are not universally accepted with other scholars like [[Thierry Groensteen]], Hannah Miodrag, and Barbara Postema offering alternative understandings.

===Defining comics===

| width = 30em
|"Comics&amp;nbsp;... are sometimes four-legged and sometimes two-legged and sometimes fly and sometimes don't&amp;nbsp;... to employ a metaphor as mixed as the medium itself, defining comics entails cutting a Gordian-knotted enigma wrapped in a mystery&amp;nbsp;..."}}

[[File:Scott McCloud.Making Comics Tour.RISD.gk.JPG|thumb|alt=Photo of a middle-aged man in glasses|Cartoonist and comics theorist [[Scott McCloud]] ]]

Similar to the problems of defining literature and film,{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|pp=128–129}} no consensus has been reached on a definition of the comics medium,{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=124}} and attempted definitions and descriptions have fallen prey to numerous exceptions.{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=126}}  Theorists such as Töpffer,{{sfn|Thomas|2010|p=158}} [[R.&amp;nbsp;C. Harvey]], [[Will Eisner]],{{sfn|Beaty|2012|p=65}} [[David Carrier]],{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|pp=126, 131}} Alain Rey,{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=124}} and Lawrence Grove emphasize the combination of text and images,{{sfn|Grove|2010|pp=17–19}} though there are prominent examples of pantomime comics throughout its history.{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=126}}  Other critics, such as Thierry Groensteen{{sfn|Grove|2010|pp=17–19}} and Scott McCloud, have emphasized the primacy of sequences of images.{{sfn|Thomas|2010|pp=157, 170}}  Towards the close of the 20th century, different cultures' discoveries of each other's comics traditions, the rediscovery of forgotten early comics forms, and the rise of new forms made defining comics a more complicated task.{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=112–113}}

===Composition studies===
In the field of [[composition studies]], an interest in comics and graphic novels is growing, partially due to the work of comics theorists but also due to composition studies' growing focus on multimodality and [[visual rhetoric]]. Composition studies theorists are looking at comics as sophisticated texts, and sites of complex [[literacy]].

[[Gunther Kress]] defines multimodality as "the use of several semiotic modes in the design of a semiotic product or event, together with the particular way in which these mode are combined"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kress, Gunther and Theo Van Leeuwen|title=Multimodal Discourse: The Modes and Media of Contemporary Communication|page=20|publisher=Arnold Publishers|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, more simply as "any text whose meanings are realized through more than one semiotic code".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kress, Gunther and Theo van Leeuwen|title=Reading Images: The Grammar of Visual Design|edition=2nd|page=177|publisher=Routledge|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kristie S. Fleckenstein]] sees the relationship between image and text as "mutually constitutive, mutually infused"—a relationship she names "imageword". Fleckenstein sees "imageword" as offering "a double vision of writing-reading based on [the] fusion of image and word, a double vision of literacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fleckenstein, Kristie|title=Embodied Literacies: Imageword and a Poetics of Teaching|page=2|publisher= Southern Illinois University Press|year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dale Jacobs]] sees the reading of comics as a form of "multimodal literacy or [[multiliteracy]], rather than as a debased form of print literacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jacobs, Dale|title=Marvelling at The Man Called Nova: Comics as Sponsors of Multimodal Literacy|journal=The Journal of the Conference on College Composition and Communication|volume=59 | issue = 2 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jacobs, comics can help educators to move "toward attending to multimodal literacies" that "shift our focus from print only to multiple modalities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jacobs, Dale|title=Marvelling at The Man Called Nova: Comics as Sponsors of Multimodal Literacy|journal=The Journal of the Conference on College Composition and Communication|volume=59 | issue = 2 |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; He encourages educators to embrace a pedagogy that will give students skills to effectively negotiate these multiple modalities.

===Comics historiography&lt;!--'Comicphilia' redirects here--&gt;===
Comics historiography (the study of the [[history of comics]])&lt;ref name="Crucifix"/&gt; studies the historical process through which comics became an autonomous [[art medium]]&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul and James Lyons (eds.), ''The Rise of the American Comics Artist: Creators and Contexts'', University Press of Mississippi, 2010, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; and an integral part of culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Coulton Waugh|Waugh, Coulton]], ''The Comics'', University Press of Mississippi, 1991, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; An area of study is [[premodern]] sequential art; some scholars such as Scott McCloud consider [[Egyptian hieroglyphic]]s and [[Egyptian painting|paintings]] and [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[Americas|American]] picture manuscripts to be the very first form of comics and sequential art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott McCloud]], ''Understanding Comics'', Harper Perennial, 1993, pp. 10–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Another area of study is the 20th-century emergence of the [[subculture]] of comics readers and '''comicphilia'''&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre Linck Vargas, [https://repositorio.ufsc.br/handle/123456789/135497 ''A invenção dos quadrinhos: teoria e crítica da sarjeta''] (''The invention of Comics: Theory and Criticism of Gutters''), Ph.D. thesis, Federal University of Santa Catarina, 2015, Abstract: "we stumble upon the inventions of a comics artistry, from the 1960's&lt;!--sic; apostrophe in the original--&gt; on, through conflicts with the art world (Pop Art, Lowbrow Art and exhibitions), through the emergence of an authorial disposal and of an institutionalized comicphilia..."&lt;/ref&gt; (the passionate interest in comic books).

==Educational institutions==
Comics studies is becoming increasingly more common at academic institutions across the world. Some notable examples include: [[University of Florida]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/comics/study.shtml |title=UF &amp;#124; Comics Studies &amp;#124; Studying Comics at UF |publisher=English.ufl.edu |date=2007-04-04 |accessdate=2009-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Toronto Mississauga|University of Toronto at Mississauga]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/dvs/programs/visual-culture-studies Visual Culture Studies - University of Toronto Mississauga].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[University of California Santa Cruz]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Art Spiegelman|Spiegelman, Art]]. "Comix 101." Lecture. Porter College, University of California, Santa Cruz, April 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; among others. [[West Liberty University]] is currently the only university offering a four-year undergraduate literature degree in comics studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://westliberty.edu/humanities/programs/english-major-graphic-narrative-track/ Graphic Narrative Major]&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, growing interest in comics has led to the establishment of a center for comics studies, the Scottish Centre for Comics Studies (SCCS) at the [[University of Dundee]] in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scottishcomicstudies.com/ |title=Scottish Centre for Comics Studies |publisher=scottishcomicstudies.com |accessdate=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beside formal programs and degrees, it is common to see individual courses dedicated to comics and graphic novels in many educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/comics/teaching/ |title=UF &amp;#124; Comics Studies &amp;#124; Teaching Comics |publisher=English.ufl.edu |date=2007-04-09 |accessdate=2009-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sol M. Davidson's [[New York University]] [[thesis]], ''Culture and the Comic Strips'', earned him the first PhD in comics in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;Sol M. ''Culture and the Comic Strips.'' Ph.D. diss., New York University, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.uflib.ufl.edu/spec/comics/davidson_coll.html Sol &amp; Penny Davison Collection - George A. Smathers Libraries].&lt;/ref&gt; while in France, [[Jean-Christophe Menu]] was awarded a [[Art.D.|Doctorate in Art and Art Sciences]] in 2011 from [[Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne]] after defending his thesis ''The Comics and its Double: Language and Frontiers of Comics: Practical, Theoretical and Editorial Prospects''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.du9.org/syn-these Article about Jean-Christophe Menu presenting his thesis at the Sorbonne].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theses.fr/2011PA010503 Theses.fr: ''La bande dessinée et son double : langage et marges de la bande dessinée : perspectives pratiques, théoriques et éditoriales''].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Teesside University]] began offering a BA in Comics and Graphic Novels in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tees.ac.uk/prospectus/ug/UG_course.cfm?courseid=1265&amp;fos=4&amp;fossub=5 |title=Teesside University Comics and Graphic Novels BA |publisher=Teesside University |date= |accessdate=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an MA in Comics from 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tees.ac.uk/postgraduate_courses/The_Arts/MA_Comics_and_Graphic_Novels.cfm |title=Teesside University Comics MA |publisher=Teesside University |date= |accessdate=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have since appointed a team of renowned comics practitioners including Fionnuala Doran,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishnews.com/arts/2016/08/11/news/the-graphic-tale-of-irish-revolutionary-roger-casement-644783/ |title=The graphic tale of Irish revolutionary Roger Casement |publisher=The Irish News |date=2016-08-11 |accessdate=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julian Lawrence]], [[Con Chrisoulis]], [[Nigel Kitching]] and Tara McInerney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taramcinerney.com/ |title=Tara McInerney Website |publisher=Tara McInerney |accessdate=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Lancaster]] started offering a PhD degree in comics studies in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/lancaster-university-offers-doctorate-in-comic-books-a6748651.html |title=Lancaster University offers doctorate in comic books |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=2015-11-25 |accessdate=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year French comics studies scholar [[Benoît Peeters]] (a student of Roland Barthes) was appointed as the UK's first ever comics professor at Lancaster University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/nov/26/great-snakes-tintin-expert-appointed-uks-first-comics-professor |title='Great snakes!'

==Scholarly publications==
Since 2000 many new scholarly journals have appeared dedicated to comics studies. Three of the most important peer refereed journals in English are: ''Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics'', ''Studies in Comics'', and ''European Comic Art''. Other notable journals include: ''ImageTexT'' (a [[peer review]]ed, [[open access journal]] that began in the spring of 2004 and is based at the [[University of Florida]]), ''Image and Narrative'' (stylized as ''Image [&amp;] Narrative'', a peer-reviewed [[e-journal]] on [[visual narratology]]), ''SANE: Sequential Art Narrative in Education'' (based at the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]]), ''Inks: The Journal of the Comics Studies Society'' (published by the [[Ohio State University Press]]), ''The Comics Grid: Journal of Comics Scholarship'', and the ''[[International Journal of Comic Art]]''.

==Conferences==
Although presentations dedicated to comics are commonplace at conferences in many fields, entire conferences dedicated to this subject are becoming more common. There have been conferences at [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago|SAIC]] (International Comic Arts Forum), [[Manchester Metropolitan University|MMU]] (The International Bande Dessinée Society Conference), [[University of Technology Sydney|UTS]] (Sequential Art Studies Conference), [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]], [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]] (Festival of Cartoon Art),&lt;ref name="Con"&gt;[http://www.comicsresearch.org/academic.html "Regularly Held Conferences"].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bowling Green State University|Bowling Green]] (Comics in Popular Culture conference),&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Weiner (ed.), ''Graphic Novels and Comics in Libraries and Archives: Essays on Readers, Research, History and Cataloging'', McFarland, 2010, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a yearly conference at [[University of Florida]] (Conference on Comics and Graphic Novels).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/comics/conference.shtml |work=www.english.ufl.edu|title=Comics Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there is an annual [[Michigan State University]] Comics Forum, which brings together academics and professionals working in the industry. Notable regularly held movable conferences include the Comic Art and Comics Area of the Popular Culture Association of America and the conference of the International Society for [[Humor Studies]].&lt;ref name="Con"/&gt;

The International Comics Arts Forum (ICAF), begun in 1995 at Georgetown University by Guy Spielmann and Tristan Fonlladosa, is an annual academic conference distinguished by its international focus and scholarly rigor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=internationalcomicartsforum.org|url=http://www.internationalcomicartsforum.org/about-icaf.html|title=The History of ICAF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The German ''Gesellschaft für Comicforschung'' (ComFor, Society for Comics Studies) has organized yearly academic conferences since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicgesellschaft.de/?page_id=4&amp;lang=en|title=Gesellschaft für Comicforschung|date= |accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Comics Arts Conference]] has met regularly since 1992 in conjunction with [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] and [[WonderCon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://comicsforum.org/2014/02/22/the-comics-arts-conference-and-public-humanities-by-kathleen-mcclancy/ ''The Comics Arts Conference and Public Humanities''].&lt;/ref&gt; Another important conference is the annual International Graphic Novels and Comics Conference held since 2010 organized by British academics. This conference has been held in conjunction with the longer running International Bande Dessinée Society conference. ''Comics Forum'', a UK-based community of international comics scholars, also holds an annual conference at [[Leeds Central Library]]; the first was held in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://comicsforum.org/|title=Comics Forum|website=Comics Forum|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Courtroom photographing and broadcasting''' is restricted around the world. The law varies from limited film and electronic media coverage in some countries, to a complete ban in others.

==United States==
In the US, photography and broadcasting is permitted in some courtrooms but not in others. Some argue that use of media during courtroom proceedings presents a mockery of the judicial system, though the issue has been contested at length. The presence of cameras can create fallacious information that can damage the reputation for the courts and the trust from the public and/or viewers observing the televised proceedings.  &lt;ref&gt;For an extensive library of materials on this issue, see {{citation|url=http://federalevidence.com/node/1345|title=Cameras And Electronic Devices In The Federal Courtroom Resource Page}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many famous trials, such as the [[O.J. Simpson murder trial]], were televised. In the wake of the O.J. trial, however, many judges decided to ban cameras from their courtrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1025175,00.html|title=Remember Televised Trials?|author=Zoglin, Richard|date=Feb 6, 2005|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after that trial, [[California Governor]] [[Pete Wilson]] announced his opposition to televised trials, and he later asked the [[Judicial Council of California|Judicial Council]] to consider reinstituting the ban on film and electronic media coverage of criminal trials. It has been argued, however, that the Simpson case was an anomaly that has little relation to the everyday concerns of media coverage of the criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=27750488|title=Justice and the Media: Reconciling Fair Trials and a Free Press|author=Matthew D. Bunker|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure]] 53 states, "Except as otherwise provided by a statute or these rules, the court must not permit the taking of photographs in the courtroom during judicial proceedings or the broadcasting of judicial proceedings from the courtroom."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://federalevidence.com/pdf/2010/CamerasICt/Cameras_Fed_R_Crim_P_53.pdf|title=Rule 53. Courtroom Photographing and Broadcasting Prohibited|publisher=Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some federal courtrooms experimented with cameras from 1991 to 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Once Novel, Televised Trials Now Common In Most States|date=December 3, 1999|author=Blair S. Walker|publisher=Stateline|url=http://www.stateline.org/live/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=136&amp;languageId=1&amp;contentId=13866}}&lt;/ref&gt; The courts have thus far been unwilling to overturn the ban on cameras, citing "concerns with expenditure of judicial time on administration and oversight of broadcasting; the necessity of sequestering juries so that they will not look at the television program of the trial itself; the difficulty in empaneling an impartial jury in the case of a retrial; the necessity of larger jury panels or increased use of marshals; the psychological effects on witnesses, jurors, lawyers, and judges; and related considerations of 'solemnity,' 'dignity,' and the like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|vol=752|reporter=F.2d|opinion=16|court=2nd Cir.|url=http://openjurist.org/752/f2d/16/united-states-court-of-appeals-second-circuit|date=1984|litigants=Westmoreland v. Columbia Broadcasting}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Justice [[David Souter]] said, "The day you see a camera come into our courtroom it’s going to roll over my

In 1965, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled, "The television industry, like other institutions, has a proper area of activities and limitations beyond which it cannot go with its cameras. That area does not extend into an American courtroom. On entering that hallowed sanctuary, where the lives, liberty and property of people are in jeopardy, television representatives have only the rights of the general public, namely, to be present, to observe the proceedings, and thereafter, if they choose, to report them."&lt;ref&gt;''Estes v. Texas'', {{ussc|381|532|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1981 case ''[[Chandler v. Florida]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that televising trials does not, per se, violate [[due process]].&lt;ref&gt;''Chandler v. Florida'', {{ussc|449|560|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[U.S. Constitution]] contains a [[public trial clause]], it has been argued that the requirement of a public trial was created and satisfied when there were no broadcasters or telecasters and few newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=37|publisher=Cornell L. Q.|pages=701|date=1951–1952|title=Televising and Broadcasting Trials|author=[[Paul Yesawich|Yesawich, Paul J.

==United Kingdom==
Photography and broadcasting of a [[Crown Court]] case in the United Kingdom has been illegal since 1925 per code 41 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1925|Criminal Justice Act]] and the [[Contempt of Court Act 1981|Contempt of Court Act]]. In 2004, a small number of cases in the Court of Appeal were filmed in a trial basis. Other courts have begun to allow photography and filming in the early 21st century; the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] has permitted filming since 2009 while the Court of Appeal has allowed it on a regular basis since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Appeal Court lets in cameras as a test for televising trials|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1470504/Appeal-Court-lets-in-cameras-as-a-test-for-televising-trials.html|date=30 Aug 2004|author=Born, Matt|publisher=Telegraph|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35854485|title=Crown courts to allow filming for first time|work=BBC News|date=20 March 2016|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some disadvantages of televised trials, from the point of view of the media, are that the proceedings are static visually, consume large amounts of [[TV crew]] time, and are sometimes difficult for the viewers to understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=60|publisher=A.B.A. J.|pages=294|year=1974|title=Justice in Living Color: The Case for Courtroom Television|author=Wilson, Jerome|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/abaj60&amp;section=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Daniel M. Kolkey argues that televising trials can distort the truth-seeking process of a criminal trial and chill witnesses' willingness to cooperate; that televising trials interferes with the privacy of victims, witnesses and defendants; that the decision whether to televise trials does not lend itself to a case-by-case determination; and that televising trials can transform them into a form of entertainment which can undermine the dignity of, and respect for, our judicial institutions. Bryan Goebel counter-argues that there is no evidence to support claims that cameras have any greater psychological effect than a packed courtroom of strangers or that the cameras undermine truthful testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.calbar.ca.gov/calbar/2cbj/96feb/2cbj19.htm|title=Should cameras be banned from California's courts?|publisher=California Bar Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been pointed out that inasmuch as no trial can be reproduced in laboratory conditions, [[scientific experimentation]] is not possible, and we thus have no empirical data on the effect of television on a criminal trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=26|publisher=Hofstra L. Rev.|pages=873|date=1997–1998|title=If Courts Are Open, Must Cameras Follow|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/hoflr26&amp;section=39|author=Sloviter, Dolores K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=51|publisher=S.M.U. L. Rev.|pages=621|date=1997–1998|title=Empirical and Normative Analysis of the Impact of Televised Courtroom Proceedings, An|author=Roberts, Ralph E. Jr.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/smulr51&amp;section=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that because the majority of Americans have had no personal experience with the legal system, and because the majority of Americans get their information about the world solely from television, the portrayal of justice on television is extremely important to the continued viability of the legal system and to the individual's understanding of that system.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=58|publisher=Ohio St. L.J.|pages=655|date=1997–1998|title=Turning the Camera on Court TV: Does Televising Trials Teach Us Anything about the Real Law|author=Paul, Angelique M.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/ohslj58&amp;section=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Charles Schumer]] argued, "Courts are an important part of our government, and the more our government institutions are shown to the public, the more dignified they become, and the more the public comes to understand them. Allowing cameras into our courtrooms will help demystify them and let the public evaluate how well the system works."&lt;ref name=Specter/&gt; Justice Otto Moore of the Colorado Supreme Court opined in 1956, "Do we hear complaints that the employment of these modern devices of thought transmission in the pulpits of our great churches destroys the dignity of the service; that they degrade the pulpit or create misconceptions in the mind of the public? The answers are obvious. That which is carried out with dignity will not become undignified because more people may be permitted to see and hear."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.louisianainsurancelitigation.com/2008/03/cameras_in_the_courtroom.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[William O. Douglas]] argued that televising trials should not be allowed because the press can use it to pressure judges to decide a case a certain way, particularly in jurisdictions where judges are elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=46|publisher=A.B.A. J.|pages=840|year=1960|title=Public Trial and the Free Press, The|author=Douglas, William O.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/abaj46&amp;section=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reference to the argument that cameras make witnesses nervous, former jurist [[Louis Gohmert]] stated, "I think nervousness is a good thing in a witness. It makes potential inaccuracies come to the light and easier to observe." He responded to the argument that cameras may make witnesses more reluctant to testify by saying, "There is a thing called a [[subpoena]]," and noting that he "found that if people are not willing to come to court and they are reluctant to testify, officers with [[handcuffs]] and guns are very helpful."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Hearing on: H.R. 2128, the "Sunshine in the Courtroom Act of 2007"|url=http://federalevidence.com/downloads/blog/2010/Sunshine.in.the.Courtroom.Act.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39155">'''Digital storytelling''' is a short form of [[digital media]] production that allows everyday people to share aspects of their story. The media used may include the digital equivalent of [[film technique]]s (full-motion video with sound), stills, audio only, or any of the other forms of non-physical media (material that exists only as [[electronic file]]s as opposed to actual paintings or photographs on paper, sounds stored on tape or disc, movies stored on film) which individuals can use to tell a story or present an idea.

==Introduction==
"Digital storytelling" is a relatively new term which describes the new practice of everyday people who use digital tools to tell their 'story'. Digital stories often present in compelling and emotionally engaging formats, and can be interactive.

The term "digital storytelling" can also cover a range of digital narratives (web-based stories, interactive stories, hypertexts, and narrative computer games); It is sometimes used to refer to film-making in general, and as of late, it has been used to describe advertising and promotion efforts by commercial and non-profit enterprises.

One can define digital storytelling as the process by which diverse peoples share their life stories and creative imaginings with others. This newer form of storytelling emerged with the advent of accessible media production techniques, hardware and software, including but not limited to digital cameras, digital voice recorders, [[iMovie]], [[Windows Movie Maker]] and [[Final Cut Express]]. These new technologies allow individuals to share their stories over the Internet on [[YouTube]], [[Vimeo]], compact discs, [[podcast]]s, and other electronic distribution systems.

One can think of digital storytelling as the modern extension of the ancient art of storytelling, now interwoven with digitized still and moving images and sound. Thanks to new media and digital technologies, individuals can approach storytelling from unique perspectives. Many people use elaborate non-traditional story forms, such as non-linear and interactive narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moursund|first=Dave|title=Information Age Education|url=http://i-a-e.org/articles/46-feature-articles/50-digital-storytelling.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simply put, digital stories are multimedia presentations that combine a variety of communicative elements within a narrative structure. Media may include any combination of the following: text, images, video, audio, social media elements (like tweets), or interactive elements (like maps).  

Digital stories may be used as an expressive medium within the classroom to integrate subject matter with extant knowledge and skills from across the curriculum. Students can work individually or collaboratively to produce their own digital stories. Once completed, these stories can easily be uploaded to the internet and can be made available to an international audience, depending on the topic and purpose of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roland|first=Craig|title=Digital Stories in the Classroom|journal=School Art|date=March 2006|volume=105|series=7|issue=7|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and pioneers==

The broad definition has been used by many artists and producers to link what they do with traditions of oral storytelling and often to distinguish their work from slick or commercial projects by focusing on authorship and humanistic or emotionally provocative content. Digital Storytelling has been used by [[Ken Burns]], in the documentary ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]],'' cited as one of the first models of this genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sylvester|first=Ruth|author2=Wendy-lou Greenidge|title=Digital Storytelling: Extending the Potential for Struggling Writers|journal=The Reading Teacher|date=December 2009|volume=63|issue=4|pages=284–295|doi=10.1598/rt.63.4.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his documentary, Burns used first-person accounts that served to reveal the heart and emotions of this tragic event in American history, as well as narration, archival images, modern cinematography, and music (Sylvester &amp; Greenidge, 2009). Some of the other artists who have described themselves as digital storytellers are the late [[Dana Atchley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dana|first=Atchley|title=Pioneer of Digital Storytelling|url=http://www.nextexit.com/nextexit/nextframeset.html|work=Next Exit|publisher=Dana Atchley Productions|accessdate=6 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219064738/http://www.nextexit.com/nextexit/nextframeset.html|archivedate=19 February 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; his collaborator [[Joe Lambert]], [[Abbe Don]], [[Brenda Laurel]], and [[Pedro Meyer]].

The "short narrated films" definition of digital storytelling comes from a production workshop by Dana Atchley at the [[American Film Institute]] in 1993 that was adapted and refined by Joe Lambert in the mid-1990s into a method of training promoted by the San Francisco Bay Area-based StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling).&lt;ref name=woletz&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Information Science Reference| isbn = 9781599048635| pages = 587–601| editors = Sigrid Kelsey and Kirk St Amant (eds.)| last = Woletz| first = Julie D.| title = Handbook of research on computer mediated communication| chapter = Digital Storytelling from Artificial Intelligence to YouTube| location = Hershey, PA| year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling), digital stories are produced in intensive workshops. The product is a short film that combines a narrated piece of personal writing, photographic and other still images, and a musical soundtrack. Technology enables those without a technical background to produce works that tell a story using "moving" images and sound. The lower processing and memory requirements for using stills as compared with video, and the ease with which the so-called "Ken Burns" pan effect can be produced with video editing software, have made it easy to create good-looking short films.

Digital storytelling was integrated into [[public broadcasting]] by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]'s ''Capture Wales'' project working with organisations such as Breaking Barriers. The following year a similar project was launched by the BBC in England titled ''Telling Lives''. [[Sveriges Utbildningsradio]] created ''Rum för Berättande'' (''Room for Storytelling'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ur.se/rfb/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206003423/http://www.ur.se/rfb/|title=URs Rum för Berättande - dina digitala berättelser online / digitalt berättande|archivedate=6 December 2006|work=ur.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netherlands Educational TV Teleac/NOT created a program with young people in different parts of the country. KQED, Rocky Mountain PBS, WETA and other public television stations in the US have developed projects. Digital storytelling is evolving from the simple narrated video to forms that are interactive and look better. These include websites and online videos created to promote causes, entertain, educate, and inform audiences.

==Components==

The most important characteristics of a digital story are that it no longer conforms to the traditional conventions of storytelling because it is capable of combining still imagery, moving imagery, sound, and text, as well as being nonlinear and contain interactive features.  The expressive capabilities of technology offers a broad base from which to integrate. It enhances the experience for both the author and audience and allows for greater interactivity.

With the arrival of new media devices like computers, digital cameras, recorders, and software, individuals may share their digital stories via the Internet, on discs, [[podcasts]], or other electronic media. Digital storytelling combines the art of storytelling with multimedia features such as photography, text, audio, voiceover, [[hypertext]] and video. Digital tools and software make it easy and convenient to create a digital story. Common software includes iMovie and Movie Maker for user-friendly options. There are other online options and free applications as well.

Educators often identify the benefit of digital storytelling as the array of technical tools from which students may select for their creative expression. Learners set out to use these tools in new ways to make meaningful content. Students learn new software, choose images, edit video, make voiceover narration, add music, create title screens, and control flow and transitions. Additionally, there is opportunity to insert interactive features for "reader" participation.  It is possible to click on imagery or text in order to choose what will happen next, cause an event to occur, or navigate to online content.

Additionally, distinctions may be drawn between [[Web 2.0]] storytelling and that of digital storytelling. Web 2.0 storytelling is said to produce a network of connections via social networking, blogging, and [[YouTube]] that transcends beyond the traditional, singular flow of digital storytelling. It tends to "aggregate large amounts of microcontent and creatively select patterns out of an almost unfathomable volume of information,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rossiter|first=M|author2=Garcia|title=Digital Storytelling: A New Player on the Narrative Field|journal=New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education|year=2010|issue=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  therefore the bounds of Web 2.0 storytelling are not necessarily clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alexander|first=B|author2=Levine|title=Web 2.0 Storytelling: Emergence of a New Genre|journal=EDUCAUSE Review|year=2008|volume=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of digital storytelling is the [[micromovie]], which is "a very short exposition lasting from a few seconds to no more than 5 minutes in length. It allows the teller to combine personal writing, photographic images or video footage, narrative, sound effects, and music. Many people, regardless of skill level, are able to tell their stories through image and sound and share those stories with others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Storytelling|url=http://i-a-e.org/articles/46-feature-articles/50-digital-storytelling.html|publisher=Information Age Education|accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telling a digital story combines a narrative, whether it be fiction or non fiction, personal or general, and digital media.  Digital media includes imaging, video, sound and all other forms of media then can be portrayed visually, the most simple of digital stories can even be a power point.  The point is to convey a message through imagery, which a lot of times can be more effective then if just conveyed through sound.  In my opinion a digital story can even be told by some social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram, where you are constantly posting images accompanied by captions in order to portray the story of your life. "A story can be as short as explaining how you misplaced your keys this morning or as long as a multivolume autobiography", the wonderful thing about telling a digital story is that there really are no rules.  Like any story you want to capture, your audience it is so important when telling a digital story. So, to sell your story, as a writer, a filmmaker, a dramatist, you more often than not will ask yourself about what stories could be more compelling to you and where you might find an interesting and profound dramatic story.

==Uses in education==
The StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) model has also been adopted in education, especially in the US, sometimes as a method of building engagement and [[multimedia literacy]]. For example, the Bay Area Video Coalition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=StoryCenter|url=http://www.storycenter.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Youthworx Media Melbourne&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YouthWorx Media|url=http://youthworx.org.au/welcome/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709005753/http://youthworx.org.au/welcome/|archivedate=2011-07-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; employ digital storytelling to engage and empower young people at risk.

===Uses in primary and secondary education===

"The idea of merging traditional storytelling with today's digital tools is spreading worldwide."  Anybody today with a computer can create a digital story simply by answering such questions as "What do you think? What do you feel?  What is important? How do we find meaning in our lives?"&lt;ref name="kompar"&gt;{{cite web | first1 = F. | last1 = Komplar | url = http://www.greenwichschools.org/page.cfm?p=4201 | title = Digital Storytelling }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most digital stories focus on a specific topic and contain a particular point of view. "These topics can range from personal tales to the recounting of historical events, from exploring life in one's own community to the search for life in other corners of the universe and every story in between."&lt;ref name="kompar" /&gt;

For primary grades the focus is related to what is being taught, a story that will relate to the students. For primary grades the story is kept under five minutes to retain attention. Vibrant pictures, age-appropriate music and narration are needed.  Narration accompanied by subtitles can also help build vocabulary. Content-related digital stories can help upper-elementary and middle-school students understand abstract or layered concepts. For example, in one 5th grade class a teacher used digital storytelling to depict the anatomy of the eye and describe its relationship to a camera. A fifth grader said, "This year I have learned that places are not just physical matter but emotional places in peoples' hearts.  iMovie has made all my thoughts and feelings come alive in an awesome movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1 = T. | last1 = Banaszewski | url = http://www.infotoday.com/mmschools/jan02/banaszewski.htm | title = Digital Storytelling Finds its Place in the Classroom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These aspects of digital storytelling, pictures, music, and narration reinforce ideas and appeal to different learning types. Teachers can use it to introduce projects, themes, or any content area, and can also let their students make their own digital stories and then share them.  Teachers can create digital stories to help facilitate class discussions, as an anticipatory set for a new topic, or to help students gain a better understanding of more abstract concepts.  These stories can become an integral part of any lesson in many subject areas.  Students can also create their own digital stories and the benefits that they can receive from it can be quite plentiful.  Through the creation of these stories students are required to take ownership of the material they are presenting.  They have to analyze and synthesize information as well.  All of this supports higher level thinking. Students are able to give themselves a voice through expressing their own thoughts and ideas.

When students are able participate in the multiple steps of designing, creating and presenting their own digital stories, they can build several literacy skills. These include the following: Research skills by finding and analyzing information when documenting the story, writing skills when developing a script, and organization skills by managing the scope of the project within a time constraint. Technology skills can be gained through learning to use a variety of tools, such as digital cameras and multimedia authoring software and presentation skills through the presentation of the story to an audience. Students also gain interview, interpersonal, problem-solving and assessment skills through completing their digital story and learning to receive and give constructive criticism.&lt;ref name="Robin" /&gt;

Software such as [[iMovie]], [[Photo Story]] 3 or [[Windows Movie Maker|Movie Maker]] do all that is required.

Faculty and graduate students at the [[University of Houston]] have created a website, The Educational Uses of Digital Storytelling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalstorytelling.coe.uh.edu/|title=Educational Uses of Digital Storytelling|work=uh.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on the use of digital storytelling by teachers and their students across multiple content areas and grade levels.

The [[National Writing Project]] has a collaboration with the [[Pearson Foundation]] examining the literacy practices, the values, attitudes, beliefs and feelings, associated with their digital storytelling work with students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = National Writing Project | url = http://www.nwp.org/cs/public/print/nwp_amsession/1417 | title = Examining the Writing Processes of Digital Storytelling }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use by teachers in curriculum===

&lt;blockquote&gt;Teachers can incorporate digital storytelling into their instruction for several reasons.  Two reasons include 1) to incorporate multimedia into their curriculum and 2) Teachers can also introduce storytelling in combination with social networking in order to increase global participation, collaboration, and communication skills.  Moreover, digital storytelling is a way to incorporate and teach the twenty-first century student the twenty-first century technology skills such as information literacy, visual literacy, global awareness, communication and technology literacy.&lt;ref name="kompar" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The educational goals for teachers using digital storytelling are to generate interest, attention and motivation for students of the "digital generation" in classrooms. The use of digital storytelling as a presentation tool also appeals to the diverse learning styles of students. Digital storytelling also capitalizes on students' creative talents and allows their work to be published on the [[Internet]] for others to view and critique.&lt;ref name="Robin"&gt;{{cite conference | first1 = Bernard | last1 = Robin | url = http://faculty.coe.uh.edu/brobin/TLA/pages/03.htm | title = Digital Storytelling Hands-On Lab | booktitle = The Educational Uses of Digital Storytelling | location = Austin, TX | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A handful of teachers around the world have embraced digital storytelling from a mobile platform. The use of small handheld devices allows teachers and students to create short digital stories without the need for expensive editing software. iOS devices are the norm nowadays and mobile digital storytelling applications like The Fold Game&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefoldgame.com/|title=The Fold • unfold stories with friends|work=thefoldgame.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; have introduced an entirely new set of tools for the classroom.

With an emphasis on collaborative learning and hands on teaching, this website offer an in depth look at how to integrate 21st Century Skills with the objectives of a rigorous academic program:

===Uses in higher education===

Digital storytelling spread in higher education in the late nineties with StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) collaborating with a number of Universities while based at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]].  StoryCenter programs with the [[New Media Consortium]] led to links to many campuses where programs in digital storytelling have grown; these include University of Maryland Baltimore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umbc.edu/stories|title=Digital Stories @ UMBC|work=umbc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cal State Monterey, Ohio State University, Williams College, MIT,  and the University of Wisconsin, Madison.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The University of Colorado, Denver,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.storycenter.org/certificate.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402063802/http://www.storycenter.org/certificate.html |archivedate=2010-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kean University, Virginia Tech, Simmons College, Swarthmore College, the University of Calgary, University of Massachusetts (Amherst), the Maricopa County Community Colleges (AZ),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maricopa.edu/curriculum/A-C/056art150.html|title=Maricopa Community Colleges  ART150     20056-99999 |work=maricopa.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others have developed programs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. The University of Utah offered its first class on digital storytelling (Writing 3040) in the Fall of 2010. The program has grown from 10 students the first semester to over 30 in 2011, including 5 graduate students. [[Mark Tatge|Chicago journalist Mark Tatge]] started a Digital Storytelling program at [[DePauw University]] in 2011. Students learned journalistic-style storytelling techniques and published the resulting stories on a class website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tellingdigitalstories.com|title=Digital Storytelling|work=Digital Storytelling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of digital storytelling among humanities faculty connected with the [[American Studies Crossroads Project]] was a further evolution through a combination of both personal and academic storytelling.  Starting in 2001, Rina Benmayor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hcom.csumb.edu/faculty/2tier/faculty/fulltime/rina.html|title=Division of Humanities &amp; Communication|work=csumb.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511004521/http://hcom.csumb.edu/faculty/2tier/faculty/fulltime/rina.html|archivedate=2009-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from California State University-Monterey Bay) hosted a StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) seminar and began using digital storytelling in her Latino/a life stories classes. Benmayor began sharing that work with faculty across the country involved in the Visible Knowledge Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digitalcommons.georgetown.edu/blogs/vkp/|title=- Visible Knowledge Project|work=georgetown.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Georgetown University; LaGuardia Community College, CUNY; Millersville University; Vanderbilt University, and University of Wisconsin–Stout.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Out of this work emerged publications in several key academic journals{{vague|date=November 2010}}&lt;!-- name them --&gt; as well as the Digital Storytelling Multimedia Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digitalcommons.georgetown.edu/projects/digitalstories/|title=Digital Stories - Introduction|work=georgetown.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ball State University]] has a masters program in digital storytelling based in the Telecommunications Department,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} as does the University of Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/imk/MEVIT4130/index.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[University of Mary Washington]] launched an open online course in digital storytelling titled DS106.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds106.us|title=Welcome to ds106|work=ds106.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course includes credit-seeking students at the University as well as many open, online participants from around the world.

Digital storytelling is also used as an instructional strategy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daigle|first=Brent|author2=Sulentic-Dowell|title=Can Digital Storytelling Improve Literacy Outcomes for Students with Autism?|journal=Georgia Journal of Reading|date=Spring 2010|volume=33|issue=1|pages=25–34|url=http://www.slideshare.net/brentdaigle/georgia-journal-of-reading-4262677}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lowenthal, P.

''The Internet and Higher Education''. {{doi|10.1016/j.iheduc.2009.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uses in public health, healthcare, social services, and international development===
[[File:Getting out of gangs (8517217065).jpg|thumb|"Day Walker" was Welcome's [[nickname]] in the [[Sonke Gender Justice]] "One Man Can" campaign tackling HIV and gender-based violence.]]

The development of the [[Silence Speaks]] project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silencespeaks.org|title=Silence Speaks|work=Silence Speaks}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1999 under the direction of Amy Hill (who joined the StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) in 2005) led to the expansion of digital storytelling in public health. Projects developed with the [[Centers for Disease Control]], the [[Open Society Foundation]], work in gender-based violence prevention with groups in California, Texas, New York, Minnesota, and with the organization [[Sonke Gender Justice]] in South Africa, the broad use of digital storytelling with [[Foster Youth]], and finally the connection to digital storytelling to public campaigns in substance abuse prevention and community mental health programs.

Digital storytelling is being used to raise awareness of the "human" factors in healthcare.

The [http://www.patientvoices.org.uk Patient Voices programme] is the product of Pip Hardy and Tony Sumner. Established in 2003, their project provides a means for people (patients, families or healthcare workers) to tell their stories which might affect clinicians, managers and decision-makers in the healthcare arena. The Programme has worked closely with The Royal College of Nursing, The National Clinical Governance Support Team, The National Audit Office, NHS England, NHS Improving Quality, Imperial College Healthcare Trust, Kings College London, University College London and many other NHS organisations and universities. Patient Voices projects have also taken place in Canada, Australia, Norway, Hong Kong and Tanzania and the stories are used in schools of medicine and healthcare throughout the world to prompt reflection and stimulate discussion and debate.

The Patient Voices programme also provides a freely accessible resource to anyone who desires to improve the quality of health and social care. All stories, once released, are  available at The Patient Voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patientvoices.org.uk/stories.htm|title=Patient Voices: The Patient Voices digital stories|work=patientvoices.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stories have contributed to an understanding of patients' experiences and their role in their illness as well as to a greater understanding of the experience of people who work in healthcare.&lt;ref&gt; Haigh, C. and Hardy, P. (2010) Tell me a story: a conceptual exploration of storytelling in healthcare. Nurse Education Today&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the process of creating a Patient Voices digital story has been used to enhance the reflective skills of newly qualified nurses and medical students.&lt;ref&gt;Stacey, G., &amp; Hardy, P. (2010). Challenging the shock of reality through digital storytelling. Nurse Education in Practice&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uses in museums===
Digital storytelling is being used by many different museums.

The largest project,  ''Culture Shock!'', is currently taking place in the North East of England.&lt;ref name="Cultureshock"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Cultureshock | url = http://www.cultureshock.org.uk/about.html | title = Cultureshock! - About }}&lt;/ref&gt; This project is using museum and gallery collections to inspire people to create their own digital stories, which are also being added to the relevant museum collections.

Another large-scale project is the work of the [[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]].

The [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington D.C. also held a series of classes to integrate arts education curriculum with digital storytelling from 2003-2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1 = J. | last1 = Springer | first2 = S. | last2 = Kajder | first3 = J. | last3 = Borst | url = http://www.museumsandtheweb.com/mw2004/papers/springer/springer.html | title = Digital Storytelling at the National Gallery of Art }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some museums help interpret and make community history accessible. In 2007, the [[Colorado Historical Society]] collaborated with StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) to create a program, ''The Italians,'' about Italian American History.  In 2008, a group of eleven museums in Yorkshire launched ''My Yorkshire,'' a digital storytelling project.&lt;ref&gt;http://myyorkshire.org&lt;/ref&gt;  The museums work with communities to use contemporary collected oral histories alongside those from archives to interpret local history from a personal point of view, through the use of historical oral recordings and archival photos. The group has also produced help guides to creating digital stories in a museum setting.

Finished digital stories can have many uses: advertising an upcoming exhibition, preserving a short-term project, building relations with communities. They provide skills to volunteers and can be permanently displayed in galleries.

===Uses for religious training===

In 2005, the Church of Norway initiated a project wherein young people raised questions of faith and life in short biographical mini-films called 'Digital Faith Stories'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital faith stories|url=http://www.uv.uio.no/intermedia/english/research/projects/mediatized-stories/studies/digital-faith.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study of this project in a congregation near Oslo found that the method of 'Digital Storytelling' could contribute to a more systematic educational method for including the lifeworld of the young in religious training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaare|first=Birgit Hertzberg|title=Youth as Producers: Digital stories of faith and life|journal=Nordicom Review|year=2008|volume=29|issue=2|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses in libraries==

A digital story station is a public space for people to create a digital story that serves to archive oral histories from the public perspective.  These oral stories may focus on a personal experience, incident, describing a place or witnessing an event.  Based on the StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) model, over 30 public libraries ranging from Northern down the coast to Southern California have a place for people to tell their own story.

Bilingual library staff work with participants to create a recording using the digital station, which can be integrated with a variety of media, including audio, video, pictures, and images. The digital storytelling station project called ''California of the Past'' is funded by a grant from the California State Library, U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services and Technology Act, and administered in California by librarians. The Media Arts Center in San Diego facilitates this project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oakland Library|url=http://www.oaklandlibrary.org/PR/pr010509digitalstory.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922052123/http://www.oaklandlibrary.org/PR/pr010509digitalstory.htm|archivedate=2011-09-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, San Diego has housed a story station in its downtown library. The Media Arts Center of San Diego partnered with the downtown public library to set up a story station where the public can create a three-minute video. The topics of the archived videos range from personal to historical documentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Arts Center|url=http://www.mediaartscenter.org/site/c.dfLIJPOvHoE/b.3469457/k.6F12/Digital_Story_Station.htm|accessdate=June 26, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009030357/http://www.mediaartscenter.org/site/c.dfLIJPOvHoE/b.3469457/k.6F12/Digital_Story_Station.htm|archivedate=October 9, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses in business==
With the development of marketing in the digital world is digital storytelling implemented in business.
Digital storytelling is used as a tool of [[user-generated content]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coursera.org/learn/marketing-digital/lecture/mqL1l/digital-concept-user-generated-content-part-1/|title=Digital Concept: User Generated Content, Part1 in the Course :Marketing in Digital World |publisher= [[Coursera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; when consumers contribute their opinion based on their own experiences about a product to promote a firm's product in the digital world.

Digital storytelling is being used by innovative startups to pitch their ideas to the potential investors and to communicate with potential customers to get feedback about the market potential of their product or service.
 
The Enterprise Center with Salem State University organized a Big Idea Video Pitch Contest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enterprisectr.org/big-idea-video-pitch-competition/|title=Big Idea Video Pitch Competition}}&lt;/ref&gt;  competition for students to submit a 60-second video pitch of a unique idea for a business, non-profit or social cause. People could vote once per day using the "vote now" button that is displayed in the voting section. The Digital Story that receives the most votes was awarded. Videos were judged on originality, creativity, and the clarity of message.
 
Project [[SomePitching]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somepitching.com/|title=SomePitching}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a crowdsourced online competition for new business ideas and early stage startups to provide feedback on their product and business ideas. The freeform explanation could be a website, a short pitching video or an animation (max. 90 seconds), a slideset (max. 5 pages with font size 20+), or any other material (or combination of materials) that was short and clear for anyone to evaluate.

SomePitching used the Innopinion platform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.innopinion.com/|title=Innopinion platform}}&lt;/ref&gt; to manage the idea rating process and the selection of winners based on the ratings from both the public and professional jury.

The intent of this competition wasn't to present the best Big Idea of the product, service, or solution only, but also to find the way, how to interpret it by Digital Story the best way from visual and narrative point of view. Because in the public jury phase, the evaluations was based on the following categories (with percent of the final score):
*Interest to buy or use the solution (20%)
*The importance of the problem the solution solves (20%)
*The value the solution brings (20%)
*The clarity and quality of the material (20%)

==Place-based digital storytelling==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
The [[Canadian Film Centre]]'s New Media Lab (formerly MediaLinx Habitat) launched a project, Murmur, out of the 2002–2003 studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.murmurtoronto.ca|title=hear you are --- [murmur] Toronto|work=murmurtoronto.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project integrates audio interviews into cellphone-based tours. StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) created Storymapping.org in 2006 with projects in [[Mendocino, California|Mendocino]] (California), [[Houston]], [[New Orleans]], and [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] (Alabama) to promote the connection between storytelling and issues of local memory and civic planning.

'''The Voice Library (TVL)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.TheVoiceLibrary.net|title=THE VOICE LIBRARY - Digital storytelling: Instantly record and share voices for generations to come.|work=thevoicelibrary.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched two, ongoing, social-giving projects in 2014. ''The Military Families Story Project'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://militarystoryproject.thevoicelibrary.net/|title=Military Families Story Project by The Voice Library|work=thevoicelibrary.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; based out of Portsmouth, NH, maintains and strengthens families' ties, builds morale through a brother-/sisterhood network, enables service men and women and their families to record history as they make it, and memorializes veterans' experiences. TVL's national ''Let Me Be Your Memory''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letmebeyourmemory.net/|title=Let Me Be Your Memory - Powered by TheVoiceLibrary.net &amp; Cognitive Dynamics|work=letmebeyourmemory.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; project, in collaboration with '''Cognitive Dynamics''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cognitivedynamics.org/2010/09/welcome-to-cognitive-dynamics/|title=Welcome to Cognitive Dynamics|author=SonarDNS|work=cognitivedynamics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a unique, six-week audio-based archiving Language Arts curriculum for students and educational institutions that builds multiple, Common Core-adaptable competencies by raising awareness of those living with memory disorders and their caregivers. It stimulates students to learn, investigate, and connect with family and community. The Voice Library changes the digital storytelling paradigm by providing users passcode-protected access through any telephone technology. It also provides online access. [[Interactive web stories|Both combine audio and still-image capability.]] For 24/7, global access, unlike social media, subscribers' private accounts are secured on the company's server.

[[File:Disney Legends logo.svg|right|220px]]
The '''Disney Legends''' '''Awards''' is a [[hall of fame]] program that recognizes individuals who have made an extraordinary and integral contribution to [[The Walt Disney Company]]. Established in 1987, the honor was traditionally awarded annually during a special private ceremony; since 2009, it has been awarded biennially during Disney's [[Disney D23|D23 Expo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McClendon|first1=Lamarco|title=Disney Sets Dates for D23 Expo 2017|url=https://variety.com/2016/biz/news/d23-dates-2017-star-wars-marvel-1201740320/|accessdate=September 20, 2016|work=Variety|date=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recipients are chosen by a selection committee, formerly appointed and chaired by Disney Legend [[Roy E. Disney]], [[Walt Disney]]'s nephew, former vice chairman and director emeritus of The Walt Disney Company. The committee consists of long-time Disney executives, historians, and other authorities. Besides the award statuette itself, each honoree is represented by a bronze [[commemorative plaque]]; featuring the recipients' handprints and signature if they were living when inducted, or simply an image of the statuette emblem if the induction was posthumous. The plaques are placed on display in [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)#Disney Legends Plaza|Legends Plaza]] at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California]], across from the [[Team Disney|Michael D.

Imagineer [[Andrea Favilli]] created the Disney Legends award, which is handcrafted from bronze each year. The award depicts the arm of [[Mickey Mouse]] holding a star-tipped wand.

Disney describes the award as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The Disney Legends award has three distinct elements that characterize the contributions made by each talented recipient.
'''The Spiral'''&amp;nbsp;... stands for imagination, the power of an idea.
'''The Hand'''&amp;nbsp;... holds the gifts of skill, discipline and craftsmanship.
'''The Wand and the Star''' ... represent magic: the spark that is ignited when imagination and skill combine to create a new dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disney Legends - D23|url=https://d23.com/disney-legends/|website=D23|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''dramatistic pentad''' forms the core structure of [[dramatism]], a method for examining motivations that the renowned [[literary critic]] [[Kenneth Burke]] developed.  Dramatism recommends the use of a [[metalinguistic]] approach to stories about human action that investigates the roles and uses of five [[rhetoric]]al elements common to all narratives, each of which is related to a question. These five rhetorical elements form the "dramatistic pentad." Burke argues that an evaluation of the relative emphasis that is given to each of the five elements by a human drama enables a determination of the motive for the behaviour of its [[Character (arts)|character]]s. A character's stress on one element over the others suggests their [[world view]].

Burke introduced the pentad in his 1945 book "A Grammar of Motives". Burke based his pentad on the scholastic hexameter which defines "questions to be answered in the treatment of a topic: Who, what, where, by what means, why, how, when".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Burke created the pentad by combining several of the categories in the scholastic hexameter. The result was a pentad that has the five categories of: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. Burke states, "The 'who' is obviously covered by agent. Scene covers the 'where' and the 'when'. The 'why' is purpose. 'How' and 'by what means' fall under agency. All that is left to take care of is act in our terms and 'what' in the scholastic formula".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pentad also closely follows the journalistic '[[Five Ws]]': who, what, when, where, why. 'Who' maps to agent. 'What' maps to action. 'When' and 'Where' map to scene. 'Why' maps to purpose. There is no direct mapping from the Five Ws to the pentads category of agency but Geoff Hart states "Some authorities add a sixth question, “how”, to this list, but “how to” information generally fits under what, where, or when, depending on the nature of the information." &lt;ref&gt;"The Five Ws of Online Help". by Geoff Hart, TECHWR-L. Retrieved April 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical elements of the dramatistic pentad==
The dramatistic pentad comprises the five rhetorical elements: Act, Scene, Agent, Agency, and Purpose. The “world views” listed below reflect the prominent schools of thought during Burke’s time, “without dismissing any of them," to read them "at once sympathetically and critically in relation to each other," and "in a wider context than any of them recognizes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fergusson|first1=Francis|title=Kenneth Burke's A Grammar of Motives|date=1957|publisher=Doubleday Anchor Books|location=NY|pages=193–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act===
Act, which is associated with dramatic action verbs and answers the question "what?", is related to the world view of [[Philosophical realism|realism]]; What happened? What is the action? What is going on? What action; what thoughts? Burke defines the act as that which “names what took place, in thought or deed.” Since an act is likely composed of many separate actions, Burke states that “any verb, no matter how specific or general, that has connotations of consciousness or purpose falls under this category.”&lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene===
Scene, which is associated with the [[Setting (fiction)|setting]] of an act and answers the questions "when?" and "where?", is related to the world view of [[materialism]] and minimal or non-existent [[free will]]. Burke defines the scene as “the background of an act, the situation in which it occurred.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agent===
Agent, which answers the question "by whom?", reflects the world view of [[philosophical idealism]]. Burke defines the agent as “what person or kind of person performed the act.” &lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"/&gt;

===Agency===
Agency (means), which is associated with the person or the organization that committed the deed and answers the question "how?", implies a [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] point of view. Burke defines agency as “what instrument or instruments he used.”&lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"/&gt;

===Purpose===
Purpose, which is associated with meaning and answers the question "why?", indicates that the agent seeks unity through identification with an ultimate meaning of life. Reflects the world view of mysticism. Purpose is inextricably linked to the analysis of “Motive” which, derived from the title of A Grammar of Motives, is the main subject of its analysis. Since Purpose is both the subject of analysis and an element of the dramatistic pentad, it is not a common element to be included in a ratio.

==Ratios within the dramatistic pentad==
In A Grammar of Motives, Burke provides a system of analysis for the Scene-Act ratio and the Scene-Agent ratio, though his analysis of ratios in the analysis of rhetoric is not limited to these. He states that, “The principles of dramatic consistency would lead one to expect such cases of overlap among the terms; but while being aware of them we should firmly fix in our minds such cases as afford a clear differentiation. Our terms leaning themselves towards merger and division, we are here trying to divide two of them while recognizing their possibilities of merger.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus any two dramatistic elements can be analyzed in relation to each other, creating a ratio, and can produce individual, yet separate meanings which are equally valid. However, the rhetor’s selection of elements to compose a ratio should be scrutinized, as it can deflect attention away from or direct attention towards aspects of the rhetor’s desire.

This is what Burke calls the “Ubiquity of the Ratios,” claiming that the composition of ratios “are at the very centre of motivational assumptions,” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1307}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, “The maxim ‘terrain determines tactics’ is a strict localization of the scene-act ratio, with ‘terrain’ as the casuistic equivalent for ‘scene’ in a military calculus of motives, and ‘tactics’ as the corresponding ‘act.’"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|page=1308}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis of a situation as a multi-faceted occurrence is central to Burke’s concept of ratios. 
Likewise, the substitution of a dramatistic element with another can change an interpretation of the motive, allowing the analyst to modify the ratio in order to highlight the importance of a specific factor. For example, “the resistance of the Russian armies to the Nazi invasion could be explained ‘scenically’ in terms of the Soviet political and economic structure; or one could use the act-agent ratio, attributing the power and tenacity to ‘Russian’ traits of character. However, in deriving the act from the scene, one would have to credit socialism as a major scenic factor, whereas a derivation of the act from agents would allow for a much more felicitous explanation from the standpoint of capitalist apologists.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rhetor-agent also has a significant amount of power in crafting the perception of these ratios to their effect, “If an agent acts in keeping with his nature as an agent (act-agent ratio), he may change the nature of the scene accordingly (scene-act ratio) and thereby establish a state of unity between himself and his world (scene-agent ratio)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene-Act ratio===
The scene, or the setting, will contain the act, or the what/actions. The way in which the agent interacts with the scene draws out specific analyses usually related to the atmosphere of the setting. While Burke states that, “It is a principle of drama that the nature of acts and agents should be consistent with the nature of the scene,” some “comic and grotesque works may deliberately set these elements at odds with one another, audiences make allowances for such liberty, which reaffirms the same principle of consistency in its very violation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the division of most plays into very literal “acts,” as the agents who construct the scene are very literally “acters” whose work is played against the backdrop of the scene.The actions that a person performs are interpreted through the setting or happenings.&lt;ref name="Burke1978"&gt;Burke,Kenneth."Questions and Answers about the Pentad". National Council of Teachers of English, 1978, p. 332-333.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene-Agent ratio===
A relationship between the agent (person) and the scene (place or setting). A scene can pose restrictions on the agent; in a narrative, the person and place should have some connection.&lt;ref name="Burke1978" /&gt;

===Act-Agent ratio===
While requiring the scene to contain them, the agent does not contain the act. Burke states that, “the agent is an author of his acts,” which can “make him or remake him in accordance with their nature.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1309}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the main principles that separates act and agent, producing a linked cycle which constructs the presentation of the agent’s identity.

==A sixth element==
In A Grammar of Motives, Burke mentions that attitude is “a state of mind,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Situation|date=2001|page=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; remaining exterior from the pentad, as it is often “a preparation for an act, which would make it kind of symbolic act, or incipient act. But in its character as a state of mind that may or may not lead to an act, it is clearly classified under the head of agent.”. Burke also refers to attitude as a variation of agency.&lt;ref name=Anderson2010 /&gt; Prior to 1969 the term attitude is placed under agency, act or agent and is not considered a sixth element.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 476&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969, Burke places attitude as a new sixth element, yet he does not refer to the pentad as a hexad.&lt;ref name="Anderson2010"&gt;Anderson, F. D., &amp; Althouse, M. T. (2010). “Five Fingers or Six? Pentad or Hexad”. KB Journal, 6(2).

'''Dramaturgy''' is the study of [[drama]]tic composition and the [[Representation (arts)|representation]] of the main elements of drama on the stage.

The term first appears in the eponymous work  ''[[Hamburg Dramaturgy]]'' (1767–69) by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]. Lessing composed this collection of essays on the principles of drama while working as the world's first dramaturge at the [[Hamburg National Theatre]]. Dramaturgy is distinct from play writing and directing, although the three may be practiced by one individual.&lt;ref&gt;Cardullo, Bert. ''What is Dramaturgy?'' New York: Peter Lang Publishing, 2005. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[dramatist]]s combine writing and dramaturgy when creating a drama. Others work with a specialist, called a [[dramaturge]], to adapt a work for the stage.

Dramaturgy may also be broadly defined as "adapting a story to actable form." Dramaturgy gives a performance work foundation and [[Dramatic structure|structure]]. Often the dramaturge's strategy is to manipulate a narrative to reflect the current [[Zeitgeist]] through cross-cultural signs, theater and film historical references to genre, ideology, role of gender representation etc. in the dramatization.

== Definition and history ==
Dramaturgy is a practice-based as well as practice-led discipline invented by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (the author of well known plays such as ''[[Miss Sara Sampson]]'', ''[[Emilia Galotti]]'', ''[[Minna von Barnhelm]]'', and ''[[Nathan the Wise]]'') in the 18th century. The Theater of Hamburg engaged him for some years for a position today known as "dramaturge". He was first of this kind and described his task as ‘"dramatic judge" ("dramatischer Richter") who has to be able to tell the difference between the stake the play has or the main actor or the director to make us feel comfortable or not while watching a theatrical performance.&lt;ref&gt;LESSING, G. E. &amp; BERGHAHN, K. L. 1981. Hamburgische Dramaturgie, Stuttgart, Reclam.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1767–1770 Lessing wrote and published as result a series of criticisms titled ''Hamburg Dramaturgy (Hamburgische Dramaturgie).'' These works analyzed, criticized and theorized the German theatre, and made Lessing the father of modern dramaturgy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/171026/dramaturgy?anchor=ref666078 Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on Lessing's ''Hamburgische Dramaturgie'' (Lessing and Berghahn, 1981) and ''Laokoon'' &lt;ref&gt;LESSING, G. E. 1766. Laokoon, Berlin, C. F. Vosst&lt;/ref&gt; and Hegel’s "Aesthetics" (written 1835–1838),&lt;ref&gt;HEGEL, G. W. F. &amp; KNOX, T. M. 1975. Aesthetics : lectures on fine art, Oxford, Clarendon Presst&lt;/ref&gt; many authors, including  Hölderlin, Goethe, Schelling, Thornton Wilder, Arthur Miller, and Tennessee Williams, started to reflect on theater, not only in Germany.,&lt;ref&gt;Hammer K, editor. Dramaturgische Schriften des 18. Jahrhunderts. Berlin: Henschelverlag Berlin; 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hammer K, editor. Dramaturgische Schriften des 19. Jahrhunderts. Berlin: Henschel Verlag; 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Gustav Freytag summed up those reflections in his book ''The Technique of the Drama'',&lt;ref&gt;FREYTAG, G. Technique of the drama: an exposition of dramatic composition and art; an authorized translation from the 6th German ed. by Elias J. MacEwan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; which has been translated into English and published in the late 19th century in the USA. Freytag's book is seen as the blueprint for the  first Hollywood screenwriting manuals. ''The Technique of Play Writing'' by Charlton Andrews, 1915,&lt;ref&gt;ANDREWS, C. 1915. The Technique of Play Writing, Springfield, Mass. : The Home correspondence schoolt&lt;/ref&gt; refers to European and German traditions of dramaturgy and understanding dramatic composition.

Another important work in the Western theatrical tradition is ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' by [[Aristotle]] (written around 335 BC). In this work Aristotle analyzes [[tragedy]]. Aristotle considers ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' (c. 429 BC) as the quintessential dramatic work. He analyzes the relations among [[Character (arts)|character]], action, and speech, gives examples of good plots, and examines the reactions the plays provoke in the audience. Many of his "rules" are referred to today as "Aristotelian drama". In ''Poetics'', Aristotle discusses many key concepts of drama, such as [[anagnorisis]] and [[catharsis]].

''Poetics'' is the earliest surviving [[Western civilization|Western]] work of [[dramatic theory]]. The earliest non-Western dramaturgic work is probably the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] work ''Natya Shastra'' (''The Art of Theatre''), written around [[Anno Dommini|500 BCE to 500 CE]], which describes the elements, forms and narrative elements of the ten major types of ancient Indian dramas.&lt;ref&gt;Eckersley, M. 1997. ''Soundings in the Dramaturgy of the Australian Theatre Director''. University of Melbourne: Melbourne. p37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==

Dramaturgy is a comprehensive exploration of the context in which the play resides. The dramaturge is the resident expert on the physical, social, political, and economic milieus in which the action takes place, the psychological underpinnings of the characters, the various metaphorical expressions in the play of thematic concerns; as well as on the technical consideration of the play as a piece of writing: structure, rhythm, flow, even individual word choices.&lt;ref&gt;Terry McCabe. ''Mis-Directing the Play: An Argument Against Contemporary Theatre''. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutional dramaturges may participate in many phases of play production including casting of the play, offering in-house criticism of productions-in-progress, and informing the director, the cast, and the audience about a play’s history and its current importance. In America, this type of dramaturgy is sometimes known as Production Dramaturgy.&lt;ref&gt;Eckersley, M. 1997. Soundings in the Dramaturgy of the Australian Theatre Director University of Melbourne. Melbourne. p9.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutional or production dramaturges may make files of materials about a play's history or social context, prepare program notes, lead post-production discussions, or write study guides for schools and groups. These actions can assist a  director in integrating textual and acting criticism, performance theory, and historical research into a production before it opens.&lt;ref&gt;Cardullo, Bert. ''What is Dramaturgy?'' New York: Peter Lang Publishing, 2005. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright==
Since dramaturgy is defined in a general way and the function of a dramaturge may vary from production to production, the copyright issues regarding it in the United States have very vague borders.

In 1996, there was debate based on the question of the extent to which a dramaturge can claim ownership of a production, such as the case of [[Jonathan Larson]], the author of the musical ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' and Lynn Thomson, the dramaturge on the production. Thomson claimed that she was a co-author of the work and that she never assigned, licensed or otherwise transferred her rights. She asked that the court declare her a co-author of ''Rent'' and grant her 16% of the author's share of the royalties. Although she made her claim only after the show became a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway hit]], the case is not without precedent. For instance, 15% of the royalties of ''[[Angels in America]]'' go to playwright [[Tony Kushner]]'s dramaturge. On June 19, 1998, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the original court's ruling that Thomson was not entitled to be credited with co-authorship of ''Rent'' and that she was not entitled to royalties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/in2/everythingisrent/articles/americantheatre5.html Scott. T. Cummings, ''American Theatre'', October 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The case was ultimately settled out of court with Thomson receiving an undisclosed sum after she threatened to remove her material from the production.

==Plot==
The story revolves around Chitose Karasuma, a voice actress who has been working in the anime industry for a year. Although she believes she is talented, she thinks the anime industry is rotten as she has only been voicing minor characters. One day, an opportunity arises for her to voice a main role in an upcoming anime adaptation of a light novel as an [[Japanese idol|idol]] voice actress with four other girls.

==Characters==

:Chitose is a university student and aspiring [[Voice acting in Japan|voice actress]] whose agency is Number One Produce. She is the voice of Yuna, one of the five main heroines in the upcoming anime series ''Millennium Princess x Kowloon Overlord''. She has a positive attitude and high confidence, and initially thinks that she has talent for voice acting but just did not get enough chances. However this is in contrast with Chitose being very cynical. She is nicknamed "Chii-sama".

:Koto is a 26-year-old voice actress at Number One Produce who speaks in a [[Kansai dialect]] who entered the agency at the same time as Gojō. She is also an otaku. She is the voice of Ria in ''Millennium Princess x Kowloon Overlord''.

:Kuzu-P (Kuzu Producer) is a producer who is in charge of the planning and production of the anime series ''Millennium Princess x Kowloon Overlord''. He does not seem to care about the quality of an anime as long as money is made.
;{{Nihongo|Gojō Karasuma|烏丸 悟浄|Karasuma Gojō}}
:{{voiced by|[[Yūichirō Umehara]]}}&lt;ref name="character"/&gt;
:Gojō is Chitose's older brother and a manager of Number One Produce. He was a talented voice actor, despite one of his drama CDs selling practically nothing. He quit his job as a voice actor after getting a big role.

;{{Nihongo|Namba|難波}}
:{{voiced by|[[Kenyuu Horiuchi]]}}&lt;ref name="character"/&gt;
:He is the president of the Number One Produce who has an energetic personality and shares a similar carefree and reckless personality like Kuzu-P. He also shares Kuzu-P's utter indifference to the quality of his company's anime, having begun the novel's plot simply because he was vaguely aware that light novels and adaptations of them were in vogue and therefore decided to try and cash in while he still could.

An '''impresario''' (from the Italian ''impresa'', "an enterprise or undertaking")&lt;ref name="ImpresarioImpressa"/&gt; is a person who organizes and often finances [[concert]]s, [[Play (theatre)|plays]], or [[opera]]s, performing a role similar to that of an [[artist manager]] or a [[film producer|film]] or [[television production|television producer]]. The term “impresario” was used by the Spanish, and then English-speaking settlers of the Pacific Northwest to describe, “one who brought a new community into being and managed affairs to ensure its prosperity.”

The term originated in the social and economic world of [[Italian opera]], in which from the  mid-18th century to the 1830s, the impresario was the key figure in the organization of a lyric season.&lt;ref name="Rosselli"/&gt; The owners of the theatre, usually amateurs from the nobility, charged the impresario with hiring a [[composer]] (until the 1850s operas were expected to be new) and the orchestra, singers, costumes and sets, all while assuming considerable financial risk. In 1786 [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] satirized the stress and emotional mayhem in a single-act farce [[Der Schauspieldirektor|''Der Schauspieldirektor'' (''The Impresario'')]]. [[Antonio Vivaldi]] was unusual in acting as both impresario and composer; in 1714 he managed seasons at [[Teatro San Angelo]] in Venice, where his opera ''[[Orlando finto pazzo]]'' was followed by numerous others.

Alessandro Lanari (1787–1852), who began as the owner of a shop that produced costumes, eliminated the middleman in a series of successful seasons he produced for the [[Teatro La Pergola]], in Florence, which presented the premieres of the first version of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'', two of [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]]'s operas and five of [[Donizetti]]'s, including ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]''. [[Domenico Barbaia]] (1778–1841) began as a café waiter and made a fortune at [[La Scala]], in Milan, where he was also in charge of the gambling operation and introduced [[roulette]].

[[Duchess Elisabeth Sophie of Mecklenburg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Lives in Music : Women Performers, Composers, and Impresarios from the Baroque to the Present. |last=Porter |first=Cecelia Hopkins |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=2012 |isbn=9780252037016 |location=Urbana |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a harpsichordist who also presided over seventeenth-century North German court music as an impresario.

==Modern use==

The traditional term is still used in the [[entertainment industry]] to refer to a producer of [[concert]]s, tours and other events in [[music]], [[opera]], [[theatre]]&lt;ref name="CraigThomas"/&gt; and even [[rodeo]].&lt;ref name="TimeRodeo1937"/&gt; Important modern impresarios in the traditional sense include [[Thomas Beecham]], [[Rudolf Bing]], [[Sergei Diaghilev]], [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], [[Fortune Gallo]], [[Sol Hurok]], [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], [[Aaron Richmond]], and jazz festival producer [[George Wein]].  [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], who produced music shows at [[The Fillmore]] Auditorium in San Francisco, was known as a rock music impresario.

While the term is not often used for women, a modern example of a female impresario would be [[Vivienne Westwood|Vivianne Westwood]], who was largely responsible for bringing modern [[Punk fashion|punk]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] fashions into the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/vivw/hd_vivw.htm|title=Vivienne Westwood (born 1941) and the Postmodern Legacy of Punk Style Source: Vivienne Westwood (born 1941) and the Postmodern Legacy of Punk Style|last=Bell-Price|first=Shannon|date=2010|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|access-date=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application of term==

The term is occasionally applied to others, such as independent art museum [[curator]]s&lt;ref name="TimeWhitney"/&gt;  and conference organizers&lt;ref name="WurmanMedalistAIGA"/&gt; who have a leading role in orchestrating events.

==Figurative impresarios==
[[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]] said of himself that he was an impresario of scientists&lt;ref name="BartlebyCouteau"/&gt;  as an explorer and filmmaker who worked with scientists in underwater exploration.  [[Nicholas Wade]] described [[James D. Watson]] and [[E. O. Wilson]] in ''The New York Times'' as impresarios of [[Charles Darwin]]'s works.&lt;ref name="WadeNYT"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22621">{{distinguish|MacGuffin (cipher)}}
In [[fiction]], a '''MacGuffin''' (sometimes '''McGuffin''') is a [[plot device]] in the form of some goal, desired object, or another motivator that the [[protagonist]] pursues, often with little or no [[narrative]] explanation. The MacGuffin's importance to the plot is not the object itself, but rather its effect on the characters and their motivations.

The MacGuffin technique is common in films, especially [[Thriller film|thrillers]]. Usually, the MacGuffin is revealed in the first [[Act (theater)|act]], and thereafter declines in importance. It may reappear at the climax of the story but sometimes is actually forgotten by the end of the story. Multiple MacGuffins are sometimes derisively identified as '''plot coupons'''.&lt;ref name="ansible"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/plotdev.html |title=The Well-Tempered Plot Device |last=Lowe |first=Nick |authorlink=&lt;!-- not the comics writer (born 1979).

==History and use==
The use of a MacGuffin as a plot device predates the name ''MacGuffin''.&lt;ref name=mward /&gt;  The [[Holy Grail]] of [[Arthurian Legend]] has been cited as an example of an early MacGuffin, as the desired object that serves to advance the plot.&lt;ref name=mward&gt;Dr. Marjory T. Ward, "King Arthur Revisited" in Dr. Andrew Keen (ed.) "Proceedings of the Second History/Literature Conference on Medieval Literature"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World War I]]–era actress [[Pearl White]] used ''weenie'' to identify whatever object (a roll of film, a rare coin, expensive diamonds, etc.) impelled the heroes, and often the villains as well, to pursue each other through the convoluted plots of ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|The Perils of Pauline]]'' and the other [[Movie serial#Silent era|silent film serials]] in which she starred.&lt;ref name="Lahue"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bound and Gagged: The Story of the Silent Serials |first=Kalton C. |last=Lahue |year=1968 |publisher=Oak Tree Pubs |isbn=978-0-498-06762-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1929 detective novel ''[[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|The Maltese Falcon]]'', a small [[statuette]] provides both the book's [[eponymous]] title and its motive for intrigue.

The name ''MacGuffin'' was coined by the English screenwriter [[Angus MacPhail]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McArthur|first=Colin|title=Whisky Galore! and the Maggie: A British Film Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HnwROL7kGqwC&amp;pg=PP1|year=2003|publisher=I.B.Tauris|location=London|isbn=978-1-86064-633-1|p=21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224215809/https://books.google.com/books?id=HnwROL7kGqwC&amp;pg=PP1|archivedate=2017-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was popularized by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] in the 1930s.

===Alfred Hitchcock===
The [[film director|director]] and [[film producer|producer]] Alfred Hitchcock popularized the term ''MacGuffin'' and the technique with his 1935 film ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'', an early example of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Marshall Deutelbaum |author2=Leland A. Poague |year=2009 |title=A Hitchcock reader |page=114 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Digou|first=Mike|title=Hitchcock's Macguffin In The Works Of David Mamet|journal=Literature Film Quarterly|date=October 2003|volume=31|issue=4|pages=270–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock explained the term ''MacGuffin'' in a 1939 lecture at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It might be a Scottish name, taken from a story about two men on a train. One man says, 'What's that package up there in the baggage rack?' And the other answers, 'Oh, that's a MacGuffin'. The first one asks, 'What's a MacGuffin?' 'Well,' the other man says, 'it's an apparatus for trapping lions in the Scottish Highlands.' The first man says, 'But there are no lions in the Scottish Highlands,' and the other one answers, 'Well then, that's no MacGuffin!' So you see that a MacGuffin is actually nothing at all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Interviewed in 1966 by [[François Truffaut]], Hitchcock explained the term ''MacGuffin'' using the same story.&lt;ref name="Truffaut"&gt;{{cite book|work=[[Google Books]]|authorlink=François Truffaut|title=Hitchcock/Truffaut|author=Truffaut, François|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NnE_sPb3XBQC|date=1983|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102082916/https://books.google.com/books?id=NnE_sPb3XBQC|archivedate=2016-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Framing Hitchcock: Selected essays from the Hitchcock annual|publisher=Wayne State University Press Detroit|pages=47–48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2ydVge4IiIC&amp;pg=PA47|work=[[Google Books]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102082916/https://books.google.com/books?id=P2ydVge4IiIC&amp;pg=PA47|archivedate=2016-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock also said, "The MacGuffin is the thing that the spies are after but the audience don't care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyd |first=David |date=1995 |title=Perspectives on Alfred Hitchcock |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqZZAAAAMAAJ |location= |publisher=G. K. Hall |page=31 |isbn= 9780816116034 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock's term ''MacGuffin'' helped him to assert that his films were in fact not what they appeared to be on the surface.  Hitchcock also related this anecdote in a television interview for [[Richard Schickel]]'s documentary ''The Men Who Made the Movies'', and in an interview with [[Dick Cavett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=cavettbiter|title=Alfred Hitchcock was confused by a laxative commercial|date=2007-10-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBRZ6GEFjG4&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-09-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503122702/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBRZ6GEFjG4|archivedate=2015-05-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The screenwriter [[Angus MacPhail]], a friend of Hitchcock's, may have originally coined the term, according to the author Ken Mogg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~muffin/faqs_c.html#Answer%201 |title=Frequently asked questions on Hitchcock |author=Ken Mogg |work=labyrinth.net.au |date=May 12, 2006 |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703212952/http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~muffin/faqs_c.html#Answer%201 |archivedate=July 3, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===George Lucas===
On the commentary soundtrack to the 2004 DVD release of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'', [[screenwriter|writer]] and [[film director|director]] [[George Lucas]] describes [[R2-D2]] as "the main driving force of the movie&amp;nbsp;... what you say in the movie business is the MacGuffin&amp;nbsp;... the object of everybody's search".&lt;ref name="Lucas"&gt;''Star Wars'' (1977) Region 2 DVD release (2004). Audio commentary, 00:14:44 – 00:15:00.&lt;/ref&gt; In TV interviews, Hitchcock defined a MacGuffin as the object around which the plot revolves, but as to what that object ''specifically'' is, he declared, "The audience don't care".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/Films-Thr-Tur/The-39-Steps.html |title=The 39 Steps – Film (Movie) Plot and Review |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193532/http://www.filmreference.com/Films-Thr-Tur/The-39-Steps.html |archivedate=January 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Lucas believes that the MacGuffin should be powerful and that "the audience should care about it almost as much as the dueling heroes and villains on screen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/02/indianajones200802?currentPage=4 |title=Keys to the Kingdom |date=February 2008 |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193209/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/02/indianajones200802?currentPage=4 |archivedate=January 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yves Lavandier===
For the filmmaker and drama writing theorist [[Yves Lavandier]], in the strictly Hitchcockian sense, a MacGuffin is a secret that motivates the villains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/livre.htm#LEXI |title=Excerpts from Yves Lavandier's Writing Drama |website=Clown-enfant.com |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118203139/http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/livre.htm#LEXI |archivedate=January 18, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[North by Northwest]]''{{'}}s supposed MacGuffin is nothing that motivates the protagonist; Roger Thornhill's objective is to extricate himself from the predicament that the mistaken identity has created, and what matters to Vandamm and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] is of little importance to Thornhill. A similar lack of motivating power applies to the alleged MacGuffins of ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'', ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'', and ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]''. In a broader sense, says Lavandier, a MacGuffin denotes any justification for the external conflictual premises of a work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/index.htm |title=Yves Lavandier's Writing Drama |website=Clown-enfant.com |accessdate=2014-01-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113150601/http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/index.htm |archivedate=2013-11-13 |df= }}{{failed verification|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
&lt;!-- Please don't add an example without a reliable source explicitly calling it a MacGuffin. Google Books might be of help. Also, please limit examples unless an existing one can be replaced by a much better one. The point of MacGuffins is that they are a very common device. This is a list of *examples*, not an exhaustive run-down of every work that has one.--&gt;

In discussing the mixed critical reception of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008), the primary criticism was that the [[crystal skull]] in the film was seen as an unsatisfying MacGuffin. The director [[Steven Spielberg]] said, "I sympathize with people who didn't like the MacGuffin because I never liked the MacGuffin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/10/26/steven-spielberg-indiana-jones-crystal-skull/?cnn=yes |work=Entertainment Weekly |title=Steven Spielberg admits he had reservations about 'Indiana Jones 4,' but still defends worst scene in 'Indiana Jones 4' |date=October 26, 2011 |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193750/http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/10/26/steven-spielberg-indiana-jones-crystal-skull/?cnn=yes |archivedate=January 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mirza Sahiba''''' ({{lang-pa|ਮਿਰਜ਼ਾ ਸਾਹਿਬਾਂ}}, {{lang|pa|مرزا صاحباں}}, ''{{IAST|mirzā sāhibāṁ}}'') is one of the three popular tragic romances of [[Punjab]]. The other two are ''[[Heer Ranjha]]'', ''[[Sohni Mahiwal]]'' . There are six other popular folklore stories in Punjab: ''[[Momal Rano]]'', [[Sassui Punnhun|Sassi Punhoon]], ''[[Umar Marvi]]'', ''[[LiLa Chanesar]]'', ''[[Noori Jam Tamachi]]'' and ''[[Dhaj, Ror Kumar]]''. These nine tragic romances are popular in Punjab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punjabiworld.com/Creative-Punjab/Legends-of-Punjab/love-legends-of-punjab.html|title=Love Legends In History of Punjab|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These six and ''[[Sorath Rai Diyach]]'' are originally from [[Sindh]], and along with ''Sohni Mahiwal'' and ''Sassi Punnun'' are commonly known as Seven Queens ({{lang-sd|ست صورميون}}) of [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesindhuworld.com/lila_chanesar.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721224737/http://www.thesindhuworld.com/lila_chanesar.html |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are culturally included in both [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] and [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] traditions.

''Mirza Sahiba'' was first written by the Punjabi sofi poet Hafiz Barkhudar Ranjha from Tahat Hazara District Sargodha Pakistan. Hafiz Barkhudar was student of a Hakeem family, ancestors of Punjab and do Bait under Hakeem family ancestors. That Hakeem family brought Hafiz Sahab from Tahat Hazara district Sargodha to a place in Sialkot Pakistan named Chitti Sheikhan. Hafiz Sahab lived and died in Chitti Sheikhan.

Mirza Khan was the son of Wanjhal Khan, the leader of the Kharal jat/Rajput Tribe origin in Danabad, a town in the [[Jaranwala]] area of [[Faisalabad]], [[Pakistan]]. Sahiba was the daughter of Mahni, the chief of Khewa, a town in Sial Territory in the [[Jhang]] district, Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Mirza_Sahiban|title=Mirza Sahiban - SikhiWiki, free Sikh encyclopedia.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
A long time ago in the village of Kheewa, a town in the control of Sial tribe of [[Jat people|Jats]], a woman gave birth to a baby boy. Unfortunately, the woman died after giving birth and was unable to breastfeed her son. However, another woman nearby had recently given birth to a girl. This woman took it upon herself to help the little boy. She fed this boy as she did her own daughter.

Thus, as is the custom for such occasions, these two children became “milk siblings” because they were given the same milk to drink. Later as the children became adults, the girl, named Fateh Bibi, got married and moved a day’s journey on horseback away to the village of Danababad near present-day Faisalabad. Fateh Bibi married a man named Wanjal, the Sardar of the Kharrals, and they had a strong son named Mirza.

Meanwhile, Fateh Bibi’s milk brother, no longer a boy but a man named Khewa Khan, Sardar of the Sial Jats, had a daughter named Sahiba.

When it was time to enroll the children in school, Mirza’s parents had decided to send him to his “milk uncle’s” house so he could get educated there. Sahiba’s father enrolled her and her “cousin” into classes to learn the Quran together since they were of the same age. 

Mirza did not know that his “cousin” Sahiba was such a beauty one can only dream of beholding. He did not notice her at first when he came to Kheewa to study because they were just children. As the two children grew into adolescence, feelings of love began to blossom between the two. 

One day the adventurous young Mirza took a different path home while walking back from school. There was a bazaar on that street. He saw Sahiba buying some vegetables for her family. He watched as she asked for various squashes and leaves to cook. When the merchant began to weigh her purchases, he weighed out extra because he was lost in her beauty. Mirza, too, was transfixed by her gracefulness and raced all the way home fueled by love.

Mirza became skilled as a horseman and archer as he grew older. He rode on a powerful steed named Bakki who swiftly maneuvered through the land. Mirza was so skillful that every arrow he shot would willfully go exactly where he wanted. Sahiba only grew more and more beautiful with time.

Soon, their love began to blossom. Mirza could not live without his Sahiba. They were lost in their own world. Once, when Sahiba had pronounced her lessons incorrectly, her maulvi beat her with a chimmak.  This thin branch gives a person a burning sting when swatted with it. As Sahiba received her punishment with the chimmak, she spoke to the maulvi. 

Sadly, their days of blissful love did not last. Sahiba’s parents found out about the love affair and sent Mirza back home to his parents. Not too long after that, they arranged Sahiba’s marriage to a man named Tahir Khan. He was from the same town. With Mirza back home, Sahiba’s parents were able to prepare for the wedding without any interruptions. 

Sahiba, via her friend, a Brahmin named Karmu, sent word of her unfortunate marriage to her darling Mirza.  As soon as he heard of this, he made plans to leave.  His family tried to stop him but he would not succumb to their pleas.  He had to go.  Before Mirza left, his father, seeing that there was no other way, went to Mirza and told him that if he went, then he must be sure to return with Sahiba or else it would bring great dishonor. With those words, Wanjal gave his son his blessings to pursue his love.
“Chal, my Bakki,” Mirza, equipped with his bow and arrows, commanded his horse to ride on to the village of Kheewa.

Mirza reached Sahiba on the day of the wedding right before the ceremony was about to proceed. He opened the door to the room Sahiba was waiting in and entered secretly. He admired her; she was dressed in bright red wedding clothes, her delicate hands darkly painted with mehndi. Without waiting another moment, he held her hand and took her away with him on horseback and rode until he thought that they had reached a safe distance.  Tired, he decided to rest by under the shade of a tree while his sweet Sahiba watched over him.

Meanwhile, back at the wedding party, Sahiba brothers called for her to come down to proceed with the ceremonies. When she did not come, her brothers realized that something was wrong. Sahiba’s brothers, the jilted bridegroom, and other male cousins rode on horseback in search for Mirza and Sahiba.

Sahiba, while keeping watch over her slumbering beloved, feared that her brothers would soon catch up. She did not know what to do. If her brothers came and Mirza woke up then her brothers would surely die at the hands of Mirza’s quick arrows.

With the hope of her brothers taking pity on her, Sahiba reached Mirza’s quiver and broke each sharp arrow it contained in half.  She believed that no blood would be spilled this way. Suddenly, Sahiba’s brothers and relatives found the couple under the tree. With one quick shot from Sahiba’s brother’s bow, Mirza awoke to an arrow piercing his throat. Mirza reached for his arrow and saw all the broken pieces. He looked up at Sahiba, searching for an answer in her face but was struck with yet another arrow, this time in the chest. Sahiba threw herself over him and together, they died.

==In popular culture==
The tale of Mirza Sahiban is part of popular [[Punjabi culture]]. There are many folk song versions, including the hit version titled "Mirza" sung by the legendary [[Alam Lohar]]. He was the first main Punjabi singer to bring this story to a song format and had a distinct way of singing it, with extreme vocal strength with Algoza (Jhori) and Chimta in 1941. Since then many other Punjabi singers have followed his style, including [[Noor Jehan]] for the film ''Mirza Jat'', released in 1982.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

There have been various film interpretations of the folk tale.

A '''musician''' is a person who plays a [[musical instrument]] or is musically talented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Musician|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/musician?q=musician|publisher=Oxford Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone who composes, conducts, or performs music is referred to as a musician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Musician|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/musician|publisher=MacMillan Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; A musician who plays a musical instrument is also known as an '''instrumentalist'''.

Musicians can specialize in any musical style, and some musicians play in a variety of different styles depending on cultures and background. Examples of a musician's possible skills include performing, conducting, singing, [[rapping]], producing, [[Musical composition|composing]], [[arranging]], and the [[orchestration]] of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Musician|url=http://www.aboutmusicschools.com/resources/musicianstypes/|publisher=About MusicSchools.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]], instrumental musicians performed with soft [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] inside and [[Loudness|loud]] instruments outdoors. Many European musicians of this time catered to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and they provided arrangements structured around [[Gregorian chant]] structure and [[Mass (music)|Masses]] from church texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IB Music Technology II Study Guide|url=http://www.salem.k12.va.us/shs/band/IBIIStudyGuide.pdf|publisher=IBO- International Bacccalaureate International}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Renaissance music}}

[[Renaissance]] musicians produced music that could be played during masses in churches and important chapels. Vocal pieces were in [[Latin]]—the language of church texts of the time—and typically were [[Polyphonic|Church-polyphonic]] or "made up of several simultaneous [[Melody|melodies]]." By the end of the 16th century, however, [[patronage]] split among many areas: the [[Catholic Church]], [[Protestant]] churches, royal courts, wealthy amateurs, and music printing—all provided income sources for composers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Music in the Renaissance|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/renm/hd_renm.htm|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Baroque period]] (about 1600 to 1750) introduced heavy use of [[counterpoint]] and [[basso continuo]] characteristics.

Classical music was created by musicians who lived during a time of a rising middle class. Many middle-class inhabitants of France at the time lived under long-time [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]]. Because of this, much of the music was performed in environments that were more constrained compared with the flourishing times of the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque era]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unit IV 1750–1914|url=http://www.historyhaven.com/APWH/unit%204/UNIT%20IV%20NOTES.htm|publisher=West Forsyth HS History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Romantic music}}
The foundation of Romantic period music coincides with what is often called the ''age of revolutions'', an age of upheavals in political, economic, [[Society|social]], and military traditions. This age included the initial transformations of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. A revolutionary energy was also at the core of [[Romanticism]], which quite consciously set out to transform not only the theory and practice of poetry and art, but the common perception of the world. Some major Romantic Period precepts survive, and still affect modern culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Romanticism|url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/cs6/rom.html|publisher=Brooklyn College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world transitioned from 19th-century [[Romanticism]] to 20th century [[Modernism]], bringing major musical changes. In 20th-century music, composers and musicians rejected the emotion-dominated [[Romantic period]], and strove to represent the world the way they perceived it. Musicians wrote to be "...objective, while objects existed on their own terms. While past eras concentrated on [[spirituality]], this new period placed emphasis on physicality and things that were concrete."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 20th Century|url=http://www.fasindy.org/education/twentieth/#axzz1qqVXde5F|publisher=Fine Arts Society Radio|access-date=2 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033148/http://www.fasindy.org/education/twentieth/#axzz1qqVXde5F|archive-date=11 June 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7375">'''Mythos''' is the term used by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE) for the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of an [[Tragedy#Performance_of_Greek_tragedies|Athenian tragedy]]. It is the first of the six elements of tragedy that he gives.

== Variations on plot ==
“In ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' 13 and 14, Aristotle turns from the discussion of the three separate parts of the plot to a consideration of the plot as a whole composed of these three parts”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 160&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Poetics'' 13, Aristotle states his idea that the purpose of tragedy is the arousal of pity and fear.  According to Belfiore, even though Aristotle uses one set of criteria for good plots in ''Poetics'' 13 and a different set in ''Poetics'' 14, “these two accounts are more consistent with one another than is often thought”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 161&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle defines plot in chapter 13 of ''Poetics'' as a variation of two different “change types” and three different “character types”.  A tragic plot is a movement or change between the end points of good and bad fortune, because of that there are two possible kinds of change: change that begins in good fortune and ends in bad fortune, and change that begins in bad fortune and ends in good fortune.  The three possible “character types” are the characters of “decent” people, people “outstanding in excellence and justice”; “evil people”; and the “in-between man”.  Of the six logically possible outcomes, Aristotle lists only four.  Aristotle contends in ''Poetics'' 13 that the most desirable plot involves ‘An in-between person who changes from good to bad fortune, due to [[hamartia]], “error.”  Additionally, Aristotle states that the plot in which ‘An evil person changes from bad to good fortune,’ is the most untragic of all because it is not philanthropic, pitiable, or fearful.’  ''Poetics'' 13 deals with good and bad combinations of character types and change. Conversely, ''Poetics'' 14 discusses good and bad combinations of a pathos with the knowledge or ignorance of the agent.  “Ranked from worst to best, by Aristotle, these are the four logical possibilities of [[pathos]]:

1. A pathos is about to occur, with knowledge, but does not occur.

2. A pathos occurs, with knowledge.

3. A pathos occurs, in ignorance.

4. A pathos is about to occur, in ignorance, but does not occur”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 171&lt;/ref&gt;

The emotional effect peculiar to the tragic action is therefore that of promoting the experience of feelings such as pity and terror, which constitute the ultimate end at which the representation of the mythos aims.&lt;ref name="Rizzoli 11"&gt;Rizzoli 11&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aristotle's mythos vs. the modern interpretation of plot ==
Aristotle’s notion of mythos in ''Poetics'' differs from the modern interpretation of plot most prominently in its role in drama. According to Elizabeth Belfiore’s ''Tragic Pleasures; Aristotle on Plot and Emotion'', Aristotle believed that “plot is essential to tragedy, ethos [character] is second to plot”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore, Elizabeth. "Narratological Plots and Aristotle's Mythos." Arethusa 33 (2000): 37-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believes that “psychological and ethical considerations are secondary to the events themselves”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 40&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle’s view focuses nearly all of his attention on the events of the plot, which, in turn, leaves the characters to become merely conveyors of situations rather than humans with convictions and motives. According to [[Meir Sternberg]], Aristotle “restricts the well-made epic or play to a ‘whole’ (holos) action, with ‘beginning, middle, and end’ linked throughout by necessary or probable sequence, so that nothing will follow its cutoff point”&lt;ref&gt;[[Meir Sternberg|Sternberg, Meir]]. "Universals of Narrative and Their Cognitivist Fortunes (II)." ''[[Poetics Today]]'' 24 (2003): 517-638.&lt;/ref&gt;). Aristotle’s definition of plot states that every event portrayed and every action taken is a logical progression from previous events.  Aristotle’s focuses on mythos (plot) as opposed to a focus on ethos (character) or “conflict either in the sense of struggle within a person or in the sense of the clashing of opposed principles”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 64&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle explains that tragedy imitates the actions and lives of human beings rather than human beings themselves.&lt;ref&gt;1450.a:16-17&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle concerns himself with the universally logical events of a plot, rather than the specific and often illogical conflicts between characters associated with those events.

[[German idealism|German idealist]] philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]] believed that tragedy consists of the conflicts between each character’s ethical justification and the resolution toward a greater rational good.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, Mark W. "Introduction to Hegel's Theory of Tragedy." PhaenEx 1 (2006): 11-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel’s viewpoint places character conflict as the central focus of tragedy, in clear contradiction to Aristotle’s plot-centric theory of tragedy. According to Meir Sternberg, modernist dramatic theory endorses the “open ending, and poststructuralism for preaching endless indeterminacy,” which is most noticeable in the modern absurdist theater.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg 519&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, Sternberg asserts that Aristotle’s viewpoint directs all complex endings and forms of closure into simple cause-and-effect sequences.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg 524&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, many of Aristotle’s conclusions directly oppose those of twentieth century narratologists such as [[Vladimir Propp]], who “reverses Aristotle's theory that ‘tragedy is imitation not of human beings but of actions,’ by writing that stories are about characters who act”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 45&lt;/ref&gt; Propp also argues that basic story elements, which he defines as functions, “are in fact ethically colored, either in themselves or because they are defined in terms of a character who has specific ethical qualities”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 46&lt;/ref&gt; Propp’s viewpoint directly conflicts with that of Aristotle in ''Poetics'' because Aristotle states that drama consists of a logical sequence of events that is not affected by ethical dilemmas.

'''''Nickelodeon Robot Wars''''' is a game show that aired on [[Nickelodeon]] from August 25, 2002 to October 6, 2002. Hosted by [[Dave Aizer]], the show was Nickelodeon's take on ''[[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]]'', the popular and long-running robot-fighting game show. The show was canceled after one season, and subsequently aired on [[Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids|Nickelodeon GAS]].

The series of six shows was filmed at [[Shepperton Studios]] in England in January 2002 at the same time as the second season of the ''Robot Wars: Extreme Warriors'' series shown on The New TNN American television network (now [[Spike (TV network)|Spike]]). Both shows featured American teams and robots flown to England for the filming.

==Tournaments==

Seven different tournaments took place over the six show series. Most of the tournaments aired within a single show, but a few spread out over multiple shows.

==Adjustments and changes==
The show featured robot competitors familiar to fans of the American series of Robot Wars, such as 'Rosie The Riveter' and 'The Revolutionist,' but the robot operators were all children associated with the teams.

To suit the younger audience, a few adjustments and changes were made to the arena and House Robots.
* All flame hazards, including the flame pit, fire jets and Sgt Bash's flamethrower, were disabled.
* Sir Killalot was renamed "Sir K," a name he was commonly referred to in the official UK Robot Wars magazine.
* The Pit Release Bumper was moved further down the arena wall, closer to the bottom-right CPZ.
* The language used was changed, with rougher language being disallowed.

[[File:Alexander Pope at Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.jpg|thumb|Alexander Pope published "Peri Bathous" in 1728.]]

"'''Peri Bathous, Or the Art of Sinking in Poetry'''" is a short essay by [[Alexander Pope]] published in 1728. The aim of the essay is to ridicule contemporary poets.

== Content ==
"Peri Bathous" is a blow Pope struck in an ongoing struggle against the "dunces". It is a prose [[parody]] of [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]]' ''Peri Hupsous'' (''[[On the Sublime]]''), in that he imitates Longinus' system for the purpose of ridiculing contemporary poets.  According to John Upton, the title reflects an actual phrase in Longinus' treatise, εἰ ἔστιν ὕψους τις ἢ βάθους τέχνη, in which "βάθους" is a scribal error for "πάθους".&lt;ref&gt;John Upton, ''Critical Observations on Shakespeare,'' 2nd ed., London, 1748, pp.255–256.  Upton's reading of Longinus does not, however, appear to have been universally accepted.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the essay, Pope introduced the use of the term "[[bathos]]" (Greek βάθος, ''depth'', the antonym to ὕψος (hupsos), ''height'') to mean a failed attempt at sublimity, a ridiculous failure to sustain it, or, more generally, an anticlimax.

Although Pope's manual of bad verse offers numerous methods for writing poorly, of all these ways to "sink", the method that is most remembered now is the act of combining very serious matters with very trivial ones. The radical juxtaposition of the serious with the frivolous does two things.  First, it violates "decorum", or the fittingness of subject, and, second, it creates humor with an unexpected and improper juxtaposition.

=== Comic use of the figures of speech ===
In chapter X, titled ''Of Tropes and Figures: and first of the variegating, confusing and reversing Figures'', Pope explains the comic use of the [[trope (literature)|tropes]] and [[figures of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;William Kurtz Wimsatt, Monroe C. Beardsley (1954) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KmrUKcU2JUoC The verbal icon]'' p.176&lt;/ref&gt; This part is continued in chapter XI, titled ''The Figures continued: Of the Magnifying and Diminishing Figures''. Among the figures covered are: [[Catachresis]].

== Models of reference ==
The nearest model for Pope's essay is the ''Treatise of the Sublime'' by [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]] of 1712.  Pope admired Boileau, but one of Pope's (and [[Jonathan Swift|Swift's]]) literary adversaries, [[Leonard Welsted]], had issued a "translation" of Longinus in 1726 that was merely a translation of Boileau.  Because Welsted and Pope's other foes were championing this "sublime," Pope commented upon and countered their system with his ''Peri Bathous'' in the [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]]-[[Alexander Pope|Pope]]-[[John Gay|Gay]]-[[John Arbuthnot|Arbuthnot]] ''Miscellanies.''  Whereas Boileau had offered a detailed discussion of all the ways in which poetry could ascend or be "awe-inspiring," Pope offers a lengthy schematic of the ways in which authors might "sink" in poetry, [[satire|satirizing]] the very men who were allied with [[Ambrose Philips]].  Pope and Philips had been adversaries since the publication of Pope's ''Odes,'' and the rivalry broke down along political lines.

One example of Pope's style and satire shows in his description of sinking in painting.  In the commonplace Academic hierarchic ranking of pictorial [[genre]]s, [[still life]] ranked the lowest.  However, Pope describes how it might fall and, with the single word "stiffen," evokes the unnatural deadness that is a mark of failure even in this "low" genre:

:''Many Painters who could never hit a Nose or an Eye, have with Felicity copied a Small-Pox, or been admirable at a Toad or a Red-Herring. And seldom are we without Genius's for Still Life, which they can work up and stiffen with incredible Accuracy''. ("Peri Bathous" vi).

: ''For current events, see [[Portal:Current events]]''

The term "'''present-day'''" (as an adjective) or "'''present day'''" (as a noun) is used to describe the approximate period of [[time]] that surrounds the [[present]]. Depending on the context, this period may be as narrow as referring to the immediate moment, or as broad as referring to the current [[year]] or [[decade]]. In general the term is used to refer to the [[wiktionary:contemporary|contemporary]] [[era]] at the time it is used.

== Media ==
When used in [[fiction|fictional]] or [[non-fiction|non-fictional]] media such as [[book|books]], [[film]], or [[television]], the term "present-day" is typically used to identify the time-period in which the depicted events are taking place, in one of the following ways:
#The events depicted take place at the literal time that the media is being viewed or read; in this case, the period referred to is [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and depends upon when the media is experienced;
#The events depicted take place at the exact date in history when the media was published;
#The events depicted take place during the [[era]] during which the media was published, where the era may be identified in a way relevant to the rest of the elements in the media.{{vague|date=February 2015}}

Setting a fictional work in the "present-day" can have many intended effects on viewers or readers. In many cases it is a [[plot device]] used to engage the audience more quickly as the events are happening in a context that they can understand. In some cases, the intention is that portrayed events are to be understood as ''genuinely happening'' "right now"; the audience is meant to deliberately play into this [[suspension of disbelief]]. Many popular [[soap opera]]s are set in the present day, such as the [[England|English]] [[television series]] ''[[EastEnders]]''. Other more fanciful productions are also set in the present day to maintain intrigue in an audience, such as [[Stargate]] or [[X-Men]].

The use of the term "present-day" can also detract from media as, in the case of movies and books, it directly reveals the age of the media. For example, the movie, [[The Terminator]], has a title card near the beginning labelling it as taking place in the present day, even though the events are shown to occur in 1984 which was true to the initial release of the movie. This can have the effect of making the movie or book a lot less believable because it is labelled as the present day but the technologies and modern culture in the media effectively display the past and not the present, nullifying the effectiveness of the term 'present day'.

These types of media are differentiated from conventional mass communications through its progressive content, reformist culture, and democratic process of production and distribution.&lt;ref name= AA /&gt; Advocates support its alternative and oppositional view of mass media,  arguing that conventional outlets are politically biased through their production and distribution.&lt;ref name= BB /&gt; However, there are some critics that exist in terms of validating the authenticity of the content, its political ideology, long-term perishability, and the social actions led by the media.&lt;ref name= CC /&gt;

The term "radical media" was introduced by [[John D. H. Downing]] in his 1984 study of rebellious communication and social movements emphasizing alternative media's political and goal-oriented activism.&lt;ref name= CC&gt;{{cite book|last=Atton|first=Chris|title=Alternative media.|year=2002|publisher=SAGE|location=London|isbn=0761967710|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radical media manifests [[New Social Movements]]’s individualistic, and humanistic socio-political model of disintermediation.&lt;ref name= BB&gt;{{cite book|last=Lievrouw|first=Leah A.|title=Alternative and activist new media.|year=2009|publisher=Blackwell Publishers.|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0745641849|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the coverage of this term coincides with other branches of [[alternative media]], namely tactical and activist media, it differs from conventional mass media in terms of its ideological and behavioural practices, making radical media significant in terms of its amplification of social movements. Downing describes Radical Media as being "generally small-scale and in many different forms, that express an alternative vision to hegemonic policies, and perspectives."&lt;ref name=AA /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Medak|first=Tom|title=The Idea of Radical Media :: Peović Vuković &amp; Pasquinelli|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwT3M_IyPbg&amp;list=PLXGV-NOEHnYkxWfKgQD2JVEGDHsVANTIM&amp;index=1|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the term categorizes various forms of alternative media that are progressive, reformist, progressive, and [[Post-materialism|post-materialistic]]. Some media that are categorized by radical media include, but are not restricted to, [[community media]], [[Student newspaper|student media]], [[tactical media]], [[subcultural media]], [[social movement media]], [[citizen media]], and [[alternative journalism]]. Groups that fall under radical media emphasize egalitarian channels characterized by inclusive, action-driven, prefigurative, and marginal practices that challenge conventional media.&lt;ref name=AA&gt;{{cite book|last=Downing|first=John D.

== Prefigurative media ==

One way of investigating radical alternative media is through ‘active citizenship.’ Downing argues that its collective ownership, goals, and participation empower the media's political stance. While mass media lessens wider participation due to costly production, radical media provides a more democratic means of two-way communication.&lt;ref name=AA /&gt;  Rodriguez’ phrase—“citizens’ media” further explains the development of empowered citizens through self-motivated participation. In her model, like [[Indymedia]], collective participation through the reconstruction of media-ecology empowers “citizenship” and the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodríguez|first=Clemencia|title=Citizens' media against armed conflict : disrupting violence in Colombia|year=2011|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=0816665842}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this discourse, political cognition occurs naturally through self-education.

This non-hierarchical and self-reliant development of political consciousness exemplifies its [[anarchistic]] values, which in turn frees collective creation and “rebellious expression” leading to a more democratic means of communication when compared with [[mass media]].&lt;ref name=AA /&gt; Like Downing, most who focus on its participatory discourse link disintermediation to “direct democracy." Radical self-reliant meaning-making will transform the representational politics’ distance from conventional powers.

However, neutral democratic mediation is arguably impossible: When examining the political significance, Lievrouw explores collisions between ‘[[Collaborative Behavioral]]’ theory viewing popular-driven social movements as “irrational and contagious behaviour,” and the ‘[[Resource mobilization theory|Resource Mobilization]]’ theory describing radical alternative media as socially rational and “communal goal driven."&lt;ref name= BB /&gt;

To address these contrasting arguments it is crucial to examine how these media develop ideologically and circulate. Radical alternative media manifests by [[New Social Movements]]’ individualistic, and humanistic socio-political model of disintermediation. In politics, collaborative journalism investigation enforces a “[[permanent campaign]]” that transforms audiences to investigative “citizen-jurors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klein|first=Joe|title=The Perils of the Permanent Campaign|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1124332,00.html|publisher=Times Magazine|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Downing explains the discourse with a “prefigurative politic” where media expression reflects their socio-political practice— “Committed speech."&lt;ref name=AA /&gt;

== Modes ==

=== Participatory radio ===

Participatory [[community radio]] has been employed by radical media groups for easier access and participation by the wider public and to broadcast their alternative voices in one of the most traditional mass media. Similar to community access television, this mode of media serves geographically oriented communities and their localized interests. However, radio often attracts smaller or newer radical media groups than television, as the entrance barrier is a lot lower.  Accessibility of the Internet also allows them to set up their broadcast more easily and broadens locality by serving a more global audience.

=== Community access television ===

Television as a means of communication has a significant role in effectively disseminating messages to a wide audiences. While many television broadcasts are privately owned and operated, governments around the world have legislated to foster democratized public-access television for non-commercial, alternative, and community oriented content productions.

* [[Cork Community TV]]

=== Online media ===

With the diffusion of Internet access and affordable technologies, radical media has grown rapidly in the past decade. The democratic and instantaneous nature of the Internet, particularly [[Web 2.0]], encouraged denaturalization of the conventional media ecology that used to be driven by media conglomerates, while allowing independent media producers to connect with the public as widely as their contestants.
 
The Internet allows for much faster and wider communication between media producers and their audience. The nature of this mode urges the appearance of an alternative and radical media ecology that reforms previously monopolized public media. This politically “pre-figurative” and action oriented participatory media activity on the Internet is evident in the revolutionary wave of civil riots in the [[Arab Spring]]. During the protests, social media was effectively used to communicate, organize, and stay connected with one another to stand against government repressions.

Online media also works as a great advantage to radical media groups for their financial, organizational, and community sustainability as it allows for broader access to lobbyists, members, and individuals.

=== Other cultural modes ===

Radical media is, however, not limited in technological means of communication. Downing argues that “the full spectrum of radical media in modern cultures includes a huge gamut of activities, from street theatre and murals to dance and song.” While audiences in conventional modes of media are perhaps more personalized, or domesticated, radical media often take form in cultural activisms in a public sphere, fostering a more active and independent audience.

== Graphics and visual rhetoric ==

Radical media contents rely largely on graphic design and artistic visual communication mechanisms that were used in 1960s underground publications, like, [[The whole earth catalog|The Whole Earth Catalog]], [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther Party Paper]], and [[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]. While there are a number of political art movements that were employed by radical media, many art historians and cultural analysts associate their artistic styles largely with [[expressionism]], [[dadaism]], [[surrealism]], and the [[situationists]] [[détournement]]—[[culture jamming]].&lt;ref name=KK&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=G.|title=Power to the people : the graphic design of the radical press and the rise of the counter-culture, 1964-1974|date=2013|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Power to the People - The Graphic Design|isbn=0226424359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political agenda that the media hold is often seen to be rooted in the early 20th century anarchistic political art movement, Dadaism, which rejects logical reasoning, forces irrationality and intuition.&lt;ref name=KK /&gt; While the early social movements focused on anti-war politics, the use of Dadaism in radical media is extended in order to critically illustrate opposing ideas of corporatism, institutionalism, and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holmes|first=Brian|author2=Sholette, Gregory |title=Civil Disobedience as Art Art as Civil Disobedience: A Conversation Between Brian Holmes and Gregory Sholette|journal=Art Papers Magazine|date=September 2005|volume=29|issue=5|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To criticize the mainstream culture and politics, radical media employs situationist detournement that remixes and alters the existing mainstream media contents such as political campaign, commercial entertainment, and popular culture.

== Criticism ==

While this idealized view may interpret radical media as sole utopian liberators, a bottom-up reversed hierarchy exists which excludes some—reflective to conventional media.&lt;ref name="Atton 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Atton|first=James L. Hamilton; Chris|title=Alternative journalism|year=2008|publisher=SAGE|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn=9781412947039|edition=1st publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, dependency on existing power structures is inevitable, as the technological production (i.e. hosting servers) is “within the walls of mainstreams” through hosting servers and when reaching out to wider audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deuze|first=M.|title=Ethnic media, community media and participatory culture|journal=Journalism|date=1 August 2006|volume=7|issue=3|pages=262–280|doi=10.1177/1464884906065512}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, radical media mainly take place in wealthy regions as the access is granted through possession of sudden info-communication technologies which are ‘taken-for-granted.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Couldry|first=Nick|title=Contesting media power : alternative media in a networked world|year=2003|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=0742523845}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the physicality of facilitating extensive reciprocal communication and the limitation of accessing institutional information due to political stance can be other obstacles to radical media.

“Perishability”, on the other hand, is a persistent issue raised by both proponents and dissenters.&lt;ref name= BB /&gt; “Cultural contexts and meanings” change rapidly, accommodating the democratic needs and movement the public is demanding. Although the Internet has significantly contributed, independence of “idea circulation” is not guaranteed, as it lacks “reliable” sources of funding and technologies.&lt;ref name= BB /&gt;

Silverstone underlines the need to “understand how meanings emerge” in media and their interference through mediation. Along with the problems mentioned above, we tend to overlook the contextual reliability issues when focusing on its political significance.

Downing argues that radical media are politically “prefigurative,” openly displaying ideologies in a “populist manner” as an “activist tool.”&lt;ref name=AA /&gt;&lt;ref name= BB /&gt; Thus, reliability is compromised by a subjective interpretation of ‘ordinary.’ Atton and Couldry explore the matter in comparison to its counterpart. While mass media establishes symbolic powers based on professionalism and its receptive-spectatorship, radical alternative media’s reliability comes from audience’s active engagement, ‘participatory-editorship,’ where audiences take part in shaping the story through interaction with the authors.&lt;ref name="Atton 2008"/&gt;

[[File:RingmasterAtaydeFeria09.JPG|thumb|A Ringmaster of the Circus Atayde at the Feria de Hidalgo 2009 in Pachuca, Hidalgo, Mexico]]
A '''ringmaster''' or '''ringmistress''', or sometimes a '''ringleader''', is a significant performer in the many [[circus|circuses]]. Most often seen in traditional circuses, the ringmaster is a [[master of ceremonies]] that introduces the circus acts to the audience.

==Duties and functions==
A ringmaster introduces the various [[Circus skills|acts]] in a circus show and guides the audience through the experience, directing their attention to the various areas of the circus arena and helping to link the acts together while equipment is brought into and removed from the circus ring. A ringmaster may interact with some acts, especially the clown acts, to make the various acts part of a seamless circus performance. Ringmasters have become an integral part of the many circus shows and sometimes will be involved in elements of some of the acts performances. 

It is traditionally the ringmaster's job to use [[hyperbole]] whenever possible while introducing the acts to enhance the expectations of the audience. Declarations of the "biggest", "most dangerous", "amazing", "spectacular" and similar expressions are common.

A ringmaster is traditionally attired in a bright tailcoat, often red with gold trim and with a top hat. The outfit is designed to look like an 18th-century gentleman's riding habit, and often includes a whip, a relic of when the ringmaster directed the performance, not as an announcer and host but as director of the many equestrian acts. It is generally accepted that this costume was first adopted by [[George Claude Lockhart]] on the orders of [[Bertram Mills]] in 1928, when Lockhart worked as ringmaster for his circus at [[Olympia (London)|Olympia, London]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Doyen of Ringmasters," Don Stacey, "World's Fair," 1979&lt;/ref&gt;  A female circus leader is known as a ringmistress, and often wears a red skirt and knee-high black boots, and either the same topcoat and tails as a ringmaster or a blouse.&lt;ref name="Ringmistress"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.google.com/search?q=ringmistress&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=N5q1U-jxEtS2yASyxIHwBA&amp;ved=0CBwQsAQ&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=962|title=Google Image Search|accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In non-English speaking countries the ring master is known by different titles. In France he is called "Monsieur Loyal" after the Anselme-Pierre Loyal (1753-1826), one of the first renowned circus personalities.

'''Rob(ert) Pilatus''' (8 June 1965 – 2 April 1998) was an American-born German [[model (person)|model]], [[dancer]], and [[singer]]. Pilatus was half of the pop music duo [[Milli Vanilli]], the other one being Frenchman [[Fab Morvan|Fabrice Morvan]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Rob Pilatus was born in [[New York City|New York]], the son of an American soldier and a German mother.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1574756/ IMDb Database] retrieved December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6299187 His memorial at the Find A Grave website] retrieved December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; He was adopted as a baby by a [[Munich]] family.&lt;ref name="MTV Obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1432182/milli-vanillis-pilatus-dead/|title=Milli Vanilli’s Pilatus Dead|last=Staff|date=6 April 1998|work=[[MTV]]|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pilatus worked as a model and [[breakdancing|breakdancer]],&lt;ref name="MTV Obit"/&gt; also appearing as a backing singer with the group Wind at the [[1987 Eurovision Song Contest]] in [[City of Brussels|Brussels]], finishing in second place, before joining Fab Morvan in 1988 to form the pop group Milli Vanilli.&lt;ref name=mtv&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1432182/19980406/milli_vanilli.jhtml|title=Milli Vanilli's Pilatus Dead|date=6 April 1998|publisher=mtv.com|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milli Vanilli===
Both Pilatus and Morvan were noticed by German music producer [[Frank Farian]], who signed them to be part of a musical act. Shortly after a trip to [[Turkey]], where the duo reputedly took its name from a local advertising slogan, Milli Vanilli was born. Pilatus and Morvan served as the public faces for singers [[Charles Shaw (singer)|Charles Shaw]] and [[Brad Howell (singer)|Brad Howell]], who Farian thought were vocally talented, but lacked a marketable image.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/15/usa.musicnews|title=Hollywood pays lip service to Milli Vanilli|last=Pilikington|first=Ed|date=7 February 2007|publisher=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=25 July 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Milli Vanilli [[Music recording sales certification|platinum album]] was ''[[Girl You Know It's True]]'', which became a worldwide hit. The album produced five hit singles including three number 1 hits: "Girl I'm Gonna Miss You", "Baby Don't Forget My Number" and "Blame It On The Rain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=milli vanilli|chart=all}}|title=Milli Vanilli: Billboard Chart History|publisher=billboard.com|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milli Vanilli won the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]] on 21 February 1990, for "Girl You Know It's True".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/services/newspaper/printedition/sunday/fanfare/ny-ffmus5567351feb10,0,5317518.story|title=Not every Grammy decision was a winner|last=Guzmán|first=Rafer|date=10 February 2008|publisher=newsday.com|accessdate=25 July 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the enormous success, the duo were a frequent target of rumours and allegations of onstage [[lip-synching]] and not having sung on the album. Charles Shaw, one of the actual vocalists, told a reporter the truth, but retracted his statement after Farian paid him $150,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318744,00.html|title=Artificial Vanilli|last=Goodman|first=Fred|last2=Trakin|first2=Roy|date=30 November 1990|publisher=ew.com|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Pilatus and Morvan pressured Farian to let them sing on the next album, Farian admitted to reporters on 15 November 1990 that they had not performed on the recordings. Milli Vanilli's Grammy Award was withdrawn four days later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2D71F3DF936A35751C1A966958260|title=Winner of Grammy Lost By Milli Vanilli: No One|last=Holden|first=Stephen|date=5 December 1990|work=The New York Times|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Arista Records dropped them from its roster and deleted their album and songs from their catalog, making ''Girl You Know It's True'' the largest-selling album to ever be taken out of print. A court ruling in the United States allowed anyone who had bought the album to receive a refund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dowell|first=Gary|author2=Evans, Isaiah|others=Jones, Kim|title=Heritage Music and Entertainment Dallas Signature Auction Catalog #622|editor=Halperin, James L.|publisher=2006|pages=34|isbn=1-59967-081-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farian later attempted an unsuccessful comeback for the group without Pilatus and Morvan. Months after the scandal, Pilatus and Morvan appeared in a commercial for Carefree sugarless chewing gum. In it the duo lip-synched to an opera recording. An announcer asked, "How long does the taste of Carefree Sugarless Gum last?" The record began to skip and the announcer added, "Until these guys sing for themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEEDE1331F937A25755C0A967958260|title=Milli Vanilli Appears Again|last=Elliott|first=Stuart|date=14 June 1991|work=The New York Times |accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Pilatus and Morvan signed with a new label, Taj, and released ''[[Rob &amp; Fab]]'', an album featuring their own voices, but the album only sold around 2,000 copies.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt; The label went bankrupt shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00EED8113AF934A35757C0A96E958260|title= Robert Pilatus, 33, Performer In Disgraced Band Milli Vanilli|last=Strauss|first=Neil|date=7 April 1998|work=The New York Times|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline, addiction and turn to crime===
In the years following the collapse of Milli Vanilli, Pilatus struggled with [[substance abuse]] and even [[suicide attempts]]. After their unsuccessful comeback, Morvan and Pilatus stopped speaking to each other. In 1996, Pilatus served three months in prison for [[assault]], [[vandalism]] and attempted [[robbery]]. Farian paid for Pilatus to spend six months in [[drug rehabilitation]], before returning to Germany from the United States.&lt;ref name=ew&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,282696_2,00.html|title=The Sad Truth|last=Chris |first=Willman|publisher=ew.com|pages=2|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
On 3 April 1998, on the eve of a promotional tour for a new completed Milli Vanilli album entitled ''Back and in Attack'' featuring Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan on lead vocals, Pilatus was found dead at the age of 32 from a suspected [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and prescription pill overdose in "Kent's Cube" at Friedrichsdorf,  near Frankfurt. His death was ruled accidental, and their final album has never been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/millivanilli/articles/story/5927796/milli_vanillis_pilatus_dead_at_33|title=Milli Vanilli's Pilatus Dead At 32|date=7 April 1998|publisher=rollingstone.com|accessdate=25 July 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622144027/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/millivanilli/articles/story/5927796/milli_vanillis_pilatus_dead_at_33|archivedate=22 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Robotica''''' is a [[robot combat]] show (similar to the early seasons of [[Robot Wars (TV series)|''Robot Wars'']]) produced for the American television cable channel [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]], a subsidiary of the [[Discovery Channel]] from April 4, 2001 to November 16, 2002. [[Ahmet Zappa]] and [[Tanya Memme]] hosted all three seasons while [[Tanika Ray]] only hosted the first season with [[Dan Danknick]] replacing her for the second and third seasons.

==Season 1==
Each preliminary show in the first season of ''Robotica'' featured four robots weighing as much as 210 pounds paired off in a series of three challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Robotica Season 1 rules [http://runamok.tech/rules/Robotica1_rules.html runamok.tech]&lt;/ref&gt; The winners of each pairing faced each other in a [[Robot-sumo]] style "Fight to the Finish" to determine the winner of the show.

*The first challenge was The Speedway. Robots raced in opposite directions around a figure-8 track. Robots were awarded 10 points for each lap completed (up to 8), with an additional 20 points awarded to the winner. This challenge had a two-minute time limit.
*The second challenge was The Maze. Robots negotiated obstacles in two identical, twisting courses that met in the middle. Five obstacles (teeter ramp, push box, rotating paddles, [[guillotine]], and waterfall) worth 15 points each, plus 25 points for the first robot to the center platform. This challenge had a three-minute time limit.
*The third challenge was The [[Running the Gauntlet|Gauntlet]]. Robots crashed through barrier walls of increasing difficulty. Five barriers (glass pane, paint cans filled with sand, bricks, [[concrete]] paving stones, and a heavy [[safe]]) worth 15 points each, plus 25 points to the first robot to complete the course. This challenge had a three-minute time limit.

Total points were added for the three events to determine a winner. In the event of a tie, the robot who won the greater number of events advanced.

The Fight to The Finish took place on a 16' by 16' platform elevated high above the floor. A low guard rail surrounded the platform for the first minute and then fell away. The last robot on the platform moved on to the finals.

The finals worked the same way as the preliminary shows, except there were six robots, competing in three pairs. Three robots met in the Fight to the Finish.  The winner of the show was awarded the largest cash prize in robot combat to that date: $12,000.

==Seasons 2 and 3==
''Robotica'' seasons 2 and 3 featured redesigned challenges. The Speedway was eliminated, The Gauntlet was redesigned, and The Maze had been completely re-done and renamed The Labyrinth.&lt;ref&gt;Robotica Season 2/3 rules [http://runamok.tech/rules/Robotica2+3_rules.html runamok.tech]&lt;/ref&gt;

The former side-by-side Gauntlet course was now arranged in a diamond-shape. The first barrier wall was now a wooden plank, the walls of metal cans, bricks, and concrete paving stones remained, and the safe was gone. Each robot had to complete their own two legs of the diamond and then return through the opponent's rubble field before climbing a ramp up to the Forest of Glass in the center of the diamond. When all the glass strips were broken, a final glass sheet lowered as the final challenge. Scoring was 10 points for each barrier, 5 points for each rubble wall, 10 points for first up the ramp, 5 points for second up the ramp, 15 points for the final glass pane. This challenge had 150 total points available and a three-minute time limit.

[[Image:Robotica rollers obstacle.jpg|right|thumb|Jawbreaker's Revenge battles Buzzbomb at the 'Rollers' obstacle: ''Robotica'' season 3]]
The former two-path Maze was now a single Labyrinth wherein both robots could roam to choose from six scoring obstacles. Also roaming the Labyrinth were two rat-shaped robots named the "Robotica Rats" that could interfere with (or sometimes help) the competitors. Breaking the glass strip beyond each obstacle claimed the points. Obstacles were:
#Push Box - 15 points
#Lifting Spikes - 15 points
#Suspension Bridge - 20 points
#Flipper - 20 points
#Rollers - 25 points
#Sand Box - 25 points
Robots started together in a motorized rotating [[revolving stage|turntable]], where combat was encouraged. A robot could be penalized the entire point total for an obstacle if they broke down or got stuck in a position that blocked access to the obstacle.

At the end of three minutes, or when all the obstacles were cleared, the exit opened. The final glass strip on the far side of the exit was worth 30 points. This challenge had 150 total points available and a four-minute time limit.

The winning pair of robots faced each other in The Fight to The Finish. The platform was enlarged from season 1; it was now a 25' by 25' elevated platform. A new rule called for robots to hold the other robot 'pinned' for no more than 15 seconds before release. A low guard rail surrounded the platform for the first minute, then fell away. The last robot on the platform moved on to the finals.

For the finals, three pairs of robots competed in The Gauntlet. The two robots with the lowest scores were eliminated, and the remaining four robots paired off for The Labyrinth. The two winning robots met in The Fight to The Finish to determine the champion.

'''Roller Games''' was the name of a [[sports entertainment]] spectacle created in the early 1960s in [[Los Angeles, California]]&lt;ref name="tbirdhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=//www.liquid-blue.com/photos/bandmembers/scott/T-BirdHistoryHome.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928165357/http://www.liquid-blue.com/photos/bandmembers/scott/T-BirdHistoryHome.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |accessdate=2008-12-15 |title=History of the LA T-Birds |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;!--Note: although hosted under a different domain, this page was linked to from the History tab of the official latbirds.com site--&gt; — This source is detailed but not neutral; better sources are needed for all of its claims.&lt;/ref&gt; as a rival to the [[Jerry Seltzer]]-owned Roller Derby league, which had enjoyed a monopoly on the sport of [[roller derby]] — and its name — since its inception in 1935. Roller Games provided a mostly televised, increasingly theatrical version of the sport.&lt;ref name="tbirdhistory"/&gt; Roller Games and its flagship team, the [[Los Angeles Thunderbirds]] (T-Birds) has endured several boom and bust cycles, including a roller derby attendance record in 1972, a major reorganization in 1975, appearances on [[ESPN]] in 1986, a TV series called ''[[RollerGames]]'' in 1989–1990 (and its corresponding [[arcade game]] by [[Konami]] and its video game for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]; there was also a [[pinball machine]] based on the show), and a small number of untelevised exhibition matches in 1987, 1988, 1990, 1993, and the early and mid-2000s.&lt;ref name="tbirdhistory"/&gt;

==History==
===1960s and 1970s===
In 1960, after Roller Derby had settled into its new home in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], former Roller Derby skater Herb Roberts founded the Los Angeles-based National Skating Derby, Inc., and its flagship Los Angeles Thunderbirds team.&lt;ref name="tbirdhistory"/&gt; The first match was skated in 1961.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} In late 1961, the company was acquired by [[Bill Griffiths, Sr.]] and Jerry Hill.&lt;ref name="tbirdhistory"/&gt;

In the 1960s, Roller Games experienced rapid growth, and established teams in Baltimore, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Florida, Hawaii, Canada, Mexico, Australia and Japan. Roller Games eventually encompassed several separate leagues: National Roller Derby (NRD), which was renamed to National Roller League (NRL); Canadian National Roller League (CNRL); and Japanese National Roller League (JNRL). Aside from the L.A. Thunderbirds, NRD/NRL teams over the years included the Chicago Hawks, Detroit Devils, New York Bombers, Texas Outlaws, Philadelphia Warriors, and Brooklyn Red Devils. Many matches were broadcast live on [[Los Angeles]] television affiliate [[KTLA]], with [[Dick Lane (TV announcer)|Dick Lane]] calling the play-by-play.&lt;ref name="tbirdhistory"/&gt; He was famous for saying "Whoaaaa, Nelly" (predating [[Keith Jackson]]) when fights broke out between the players.&lt;ref name="tbirdhistory"/&gt;Lane's play-by-play was often assisted in the press box and on the infield by Bill "Hoppy" Haupt. The [[Grand Olympic Auditorium|Olympic Auditorium]] was the league's primary venue.&lt;ref name="tbirdhistory"/&gt; Eventually, the flagship station for Thunderbirds games was changed to [[KCOP]], with taped repeats appearing in prime time on [[KVEA|KBSC]].

In order to compete with Roller Games' international flair, Seltzer's Roller Derby also formed its own International Roller Derby League (IRDL), which included Roller Derby's most famous teams, the Bay Bombers, Midwest Pioneers, and Jolters, among others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030728065919/http://www.rollersport.us/history2.cfm Rollersport - History - Page 2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rollerderbypreservationassociation.com/modules.php?name=Leagues&amp;op=ShowLeagueAll&amp;id=175&amp;id_cat=32&amp;categories=ROLLERGAMES{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some former Roller Derby stars found new fame in the Roller Games, and a handful of skaters simply went back and forth between the two organizations. After 1968, however, the Roller Derby to Roller Games defections were quite few; instead, a handful of Roller Games skaters returned to their roots and began skating for the Derby again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1972, an interleague match between the Los Angeles Thunderbirds and Roller Derby's Chicago/Midwest Pioneers set a roller derby attendance record of 50,118 at Comiskey Park in Chicago.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}&lt;!--a ref also needs to be added to the same info in the History of roller derby article--&gt;

In 1973, Jerry Seltzer shut down Roller Derby and sold the promotional rights to Bill Griffiths, who immediately disbanded Roller Derby's IRDL and his own NRL, but recruited some of IRDL's star skaters to skate in an NRL successor league, the International Skating Conference (ISC), which was to focus on the Los Angeles Thunderbirds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030728071050/http://www.rollersport.us/history4.cfm Rollersport - History - Page 4&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rollerderbypreservationassociation.com/modules.php?name=Leagues&amp;op=ShowLeagueAll&amp;id=179&amp;id_cat=32&amp;categories=ROLLERGAMES{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teams in the ISC included the L.A. T-Birds, the Eastern Warriors, and several international teams: Team Canada, the Tokyo Bombers, and the Latin Libertadores.&lt;ref name="rdtl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rollerderbyhalloffame.com/_wsn/page3.html|title=Roller Derby Timeline|accessdate=2008-12-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080802162126/http://rollerderbyhalloffame.com/_wsn/page3.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The league also featured the San Francisco Bay Bombers in certain games, in which the storylines were built around the Thunderbirds claiming the Bombers were infringing on their territory; the Bombers continued to skate in spite of this.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai6hRTNiqiA&lt;/ref&gt;  (This incarnation of the Bombers was also unique in that three notable veterans, [[Ann Calvello]], [[Joan Weston]], and [[Annis Jensen]] all skated on the same team.  Jensen's daughter, [[Barbara Baker]], also skated for the Bombers.)

In 1975, Griffiths shut down Roller Games operations in the face of dwindling popularity, which some attributed to the organization's increasing emphasis on theatrics and entertainment.&lt;ref name="tbirdhistory"/&gt; However, skaters quickly organized a new version of the club, and a new training center opened.&lt;ref name="tbirdhistory"/&gt; Thunderbirds games were locally broadcast on [[KVEA|KBSC]] Channel 52, the [[Kaiser Broadcasting]] station for the Los Angeles market, allowing for distribution to other Kaiser stations like San Francisco's [[KBCW (TV)|KBHK]], Chicago's [[WFLD]] and Detroit's [[WKBD]]. Jerry Hill headed up the [[Philadelphia]]-based team, the Warriors, whose games were broadcast on Kaiser-owned [[WKBS-TV (Philadelphia)|WKBS]] with announcer Elmer Anderson.

The revitalized league prospered in the late 1970s and early 1980s: its home venue, the Olympic Auditorium, was sold out for matches on Saturday nights; games were aired on TV (as "Roller Superstars"); and skaters "Psycho" Ronnie Rains and [[Ralphie Valladares]] became minor celebrities in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="tbirdhistory"/&gt;

In 1985, the International Roller Derby League name was reactivated (although it was still a Roller Games format), retaining many skaters from "Roller Superstars" (renamed "Championship Roller Derby") and recruiting new skaters.  Along with the Los Angeles T-Birds, the other teams were now known as the Northern Devils, Western Outlaws, Golden State Bombers, Hollywood Hawks and Eastern War-Chiefs.  Games were skated at the Showboat Sports Pavilion in Las Vegas NV with the exception of Eastern War-Chiefs games which were played at the Hartford Civic Center in Hartford CT.  This version of the IRDL was broadcast on [[ESPN]] and hosted by Los Angeles radio personality Paul Greenwood with play-by-play analysis by former roller derby skaters Ted Marolf and Jess Adams.  Despite having a number of games skated from 1985-1986, the club again fell into decline, with its aging skaters having no place to practice after the closure of the training facility.&lt;ref name="tbirdhistory"/&gt; Griffiths retained the rights to the Roller Games name, however, and organized several matches in 1987 and 1988.&lt;ref name="tbirdhistory"/&gt;

===RollerGames===
{{main|RollerGames}}
In 1989, television producers David Sams and Mike Miller worked with Griffiths to produce ''RollerGames'', a U.S. television show that presented an even more theatrical variant of the sport for a national audience. It featured a steeply banked figure-eight track, an alligator pit, and a number of skaters who had been in the Roller Games league, as well as younger participants. It was broadcast for one season (1989–1990) before its distributor, Quintex Media, went bankrupt. The bankruptcy was not related to the popularity of ''RollerGames''.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Ratings for the series were actually quite high, even beating the popular ''[[American Gladiators]]''.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

Sams provided color commentary while [[Chuck Underwood]] handled the play-by-play, and was famous for saying "That was absolutely DEV-A-STAT-ING!"  [[Shelley Jamison]] served as the "on-the-track" commentator while the late [[Wally George]] did halftime commentary.

===Roller Games International===
Following the cancellation of ''RollerGames'', Griffiths organized three untelevised Roller Games International (RGI) events:
* August 8, 1990 in [[Edmonton, Alberta]] (Canada)
* August 9, 1990 in [[Calgary, Alberta]] (Canada)
* February 6, 1993 in [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]] (USA)
All three matches were T-Birds vs. RGI All-Stars.&lt;ref name="tbirdhistory"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.groups.yahoo.com/group/bankedtracknews/message/67?threaded=1&amp;source=1 Post by "williamwsl1"] on bankedtracknews, February 24, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization remained dormant for the rest of the 1990s, although the six teams from ''RollerGames'' still performed for the public in the Super Roller Dome with the same rules.&lt;ref name="tbirdhistory"/&gt;

===2000s===
Griffiths' son, Bill Griffiths Jr., relaunched Roller Games International in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rollerderbypreservationassociation.com/autohtml.php?filename=Banked_Track_News_Archives/issue09.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--details please?--&gt;

In 2003, former Roller Games skater Lou Sanchez used the T'Birds name in a one-off match, [[National Roller Derby League]].&lt;ref name="tbirdhistory"/&gt;

In 2004, Bob Sedillo purchased the T-Birds name for use in a disastrous exposition match in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] against a team of young female skaters associated with the modern revival of the sport.&lt;ref name="tbirdhistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="duel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.girlswithguns.org/long/rvsr.htm|title=Girls With Guns: Duel in the Desert|accessdate=2008-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2004, the Bob Sedillo-owned Roller Games International (RGI) league still operates a single team, the Los Angeles Thunderbirds (T-Birds). A match between the ARSD's San Francisco Bay Bombers and RGI's Los Angeles Thunderbirds (T-Birds) took place on July 29, 2006 at [[Kezar Stadium]] in San Francisco. The Bay Bombers defeated the T-Birds 81-79.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latbirds.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=144&amp;Itemid=77 Los Angeles Thunderbirds&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The T-Birds' last home was at the Pomona Fairplex. Several games were skated there in 2007 and 2008. Promotions ceased once trademark owner Bill Griffiths sued Sedillo's Pegasus Media Group. Bob Sedillo died in December 2009.

'''Sardonicism''' is "the quality or state of being sardonic; an instance of this; a sardonic remark."&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'': "sardonicism".&lt;/ref&gt; A ''sardonic'' action is one that is "disdainfully or skeptically humorous" or "derisively mocking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sardonic|title=Definition of SARDONIC|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, when referring to laughter or a smile, it is "bitter, scornful, mocking". Hence, when referring to a person or a personal attribute, it is "[c]haracterized by or exhibiting bitterness, scorn or mockery."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sardonic|title=Definition of sardonic in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

Both the origin of the concept and the etymology of the word sardonicism is uncertain, but it appears to stem from the name for the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] island of [[Sardinia]]. The 10th-century [[Byzantine|Byzantine Greek]] encyclopedia ''[[Suda]]'' traces the word's earliest roots to the notion of grinning ({{lang-grc|σαίρω| sairō}}) in the face of danger, or curling one's lips back at evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?login=guest&amp;enlogin=guest&amp;db=REAL&amp;field=adlerhw_gr&amp;searchstr=sigma,124|title=SOL Search|website=www.stoa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One explanation for the later alteration to its more familiar form and connection to laughter (supported by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'') appears to stem from an ancient belief that ingesting the [[Water dropwort#Sardonic grin|''sardonion'']] (σαρδόνιον) plant from [[Sardinia]] (Σαρδώ) would result in convulsions resembling laughter and, ultimately, death.&lt;ref name="reference1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=sardonic |title=Sardonic &amp;#124; Define Sardonic at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Theory and History of Folklore'', [[Vladimir Propp]] discusses alleged examples of ritual laughter accompanying death and killing, all involving groups. These he characterized as sardonic laughter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Among the very ancient [[Sardinians|people of Sardinia]], who were called Sardi or Sardoni, it was customary to kill old people. While killing their old people, the Sardi laughed loudly. This is the origin of notorious sardonic laughter (Eugen Fehrle, 1930). In light of our findings things begin to look different. Laughter accompanies the passage from death to life; it creates life and accompanies birth. Consequently, laughter accompanying killing transforms death into a new birth, nullifies murder as such, and is an act of piety that transforms death into a new life.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Propp, ''[https://monoskop.org/images/f/f0/Propp_Vladimir_Theory_and_History_of_Folklore.pdf Theory and History of Folklore]'': Ritual laughter in folklore, pp. 134-35. Anthology edited by [[Anatoly Liberman]] (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A root form may first appear in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' as the [[Ancient Greek]] ''sardánios'', for scornful laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sardonic?showCookiePolicy=true|title=Sardonic definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the {{Lang|el-Latn|sardónios}} evolved the {{lang-la|sardonius}}, thence the {{lang-fr|sardonique}}, and ultimately the familiar English adjectival form, ''sardonic''.&lt;ref name="reference1"/&gt;

== ''Risus sardonicus'' ==
{{Main|Risus sardonicus}}
''[[Risus sardonicus]]'' is an apparent smile on the face of those who are convulsing because of [[tetanus]], or [[strychnine]] poisoning. From the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', "A fixed, grin-like expression resulting from spasm of facial muscles, esp. in tetanus." Also:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Convulsion of the] facial muscles may cause a characteristic expression called ''Risus sardonicus'' (from the Latin for scornful laughter) or ''Risus caninus'' (from the Latin for doglike laughter or grinning). This facial expression has also been observed among patients with tetanus. ''Risus sardonicus'' causes a patient's eyebrows to rise, eyes to bulge, and mouth to retract dramatically, resulting in what has been described as an evil-looking grin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AgfjGTxPM2MC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=Strychnine+risus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wB7IU7SHMtKf7Abj9ICoAw&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Strychnine%20risus&amp;f=false Holstege, C. et al., ''Criminal Poisoning: Clinical and Forensic Perspectives'', by Christopher Holstege, Thomas Neer, Gregory Saathoff, and Brent Furbee, Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning, 2010, p. 161.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Hemlock water dropwort ===

In 2009 scientists at the [[University of Eastern Piedmont]] in [[Italy]] claimed to have identified hemlock [[water dropwort]] (''Oenanthe crocata'') as the plant responsible for producing the sardonic grin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Journal of Natural Products|year = 2009|volume = 72|issue = 5|pages = 962–965|title = Polyacetylenes from Sardinian ''Oenanthe fistulosa'': A Molecular Clue to ''risus sardonicus''|author1=G.

When these people were unable to support themselves, they were [[Substance intoxication|intoxicated]] with this herb and then dropped from a high rock or beaten to death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=in-brief-aug-09 News Scan Briefs: Killer Smile], Scientific American, August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Show, don't tell''' is a technique used in various kinds of texts to allow the reader to experience the story through [[Action (fiction)|action]], words, thoughts, senses, and feelings rather than through the author's [[exposition (narrative)|exposition]], summarization, and [[description]]. It avoids adjectives describing the author's analysis, but instead describes the scene in such a way that the reader can draw his or her own conclusions. The technique applies equally to [[nonfiction]] and all forms of [[fiction]], literature including [[Haiku]]&lt;ref&gt;British Haiku Society- occasional paper 'English Haiku: a Composite View'2002&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Imagism]] poetry in particular, speech, movie making, and playwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Wells | year = 1999 | title = How To Write Non-Fiction Books | publisher = Writers' Bookshop | page = 65 | isbn= 1902713028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Warren | year = 2011 | title = Show Don't Tell: A Guide to Purpose Driven Speech | publisher = Jerianne Warren | isbn= 0615498353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mackendrick, Cronin, Scorsese | year = 2005 | title = On Film-making: An Introduction to the Craft of the Director | publisher = Faber \&amp; Faber | page = xxiii | isbn= 0571211259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hatcher | year = 2000 | title = The Art and Craft of Playwriting | publisher = F+W Media | page = 43 | isbn= 1884910467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is often attributed to Russian playwright [[Anton Chekhov]], reputed to have said "Don't tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass." What Chekhov actually said, in a letter to his brother, was "In descriptions of Nature one must seize on small details, grouping them so that when the reader closes his eyes he gets a picture. For instance, you’ll have a moonlit night if you write that on the mill dam a piece of glass from a broken bottle glittered like a bright little star, and that the black shadow of a dog or a wolf rolled past like a ball." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yarmolinsky|first=Avrahm|year=1954|title=The Unknown Chekhov: Stories and Other Writings Hitherto Untranslated by Anton Chekhov|page=14|publisher=Noonday Press, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between telling and showing was popularized in [[Percy Lubbock]]'s book ''The Craft of Fiction'' (1921), and has been an important element in Anglo-Saxon [[narratology|narratological theory]] ever since.

==Examples==
===Ernest Hemingway===

Nobel Prize–winning novelist [[Ernest Hemingway]] was a notable proponent of the "show, don't tell" style. His [[Iceberg Theory]], also known as the "theory of omission", developed from his background as a newspaper reporter. The term itself originates from his bullfighting treatise, ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0v1GUke_ncMC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=If+a+writer+of+prose+knows+enough+of+what+he+is+writing+about+he+may+omit+things+that+he+knows+and+the+reader,+if+the+writer+is+writing+truly+enough,+will+have+a+feeling+of+those+things+as+strongly+as+though+the+writer+had+stated+them.+The+dignity+of+movement+of+an+iceberg+is+due+to+only+one-eighth+of+it+being+above+water.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-4-Pywc3XAhVEJFAKHaiMAW8QuwUIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Hemingway's Theaters of Masculinity|first=Thomas F.|last=Strychacz|date=20 November 2017|publisher=LSU Press|accessdate=20 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a writer of prose knows enough of what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them. The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Creative literature (as opposed to technical writing or objective journalism) in general hinges on the artful use of a wide range of devices (such as inference, [[metaphor]], understatement, the [[unreliable narrator]], and ambiguity) that reward the careful reader's appreciation of subtext and extrapolation of what the author chooses to leave unsaid, untold, and/or unshown. This suggests a form of respect for the reader, who should be trusted to develop a feeling for the meaning behind the action, without having the point painfully laid out for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=izK6BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17&amp;lpg=PT17&amp;dq=develop+a+feeling+for+the+meaning+behind+the+action,+without+having+the+point+painfully+laid+out+for+them&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=82FuRr_SB2&amp;sig=Ucrfj3FnKus-LfTEeIL0VllGDBE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy2qmsw83XAhVFJ1AKHbJvD9sQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=How to Write a Novel in 90 Days|first=Conrad|last=Jones|date=21 October 2013|publisher=Andrews UK Limited|accessdate=20 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chuck Palahniuk===

In a 2013 article, [[Chuck Palahniuk]] (author of the novel ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'') goes as far as recommending a ban of what he calls "thought verbs" ("Thinks, Knows, Understands, Realizes, Believes, Wants, Remembers, Imagines, Desires […]") favoring instead the use of "specific sensory detail: action, smell, taste, sound, and feeling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palahniuk|first=Chuck|title=Nuts and Bolts: "Thought" Verbs|url=http://litreactor.com/essays/chuck-palahniuk/nuts-and-bolts-%E2%80%9Cthought%E2%80%9D-verbs|work=LitReactor|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Scott Bell===

"Show, don't tell" should not be applied to all incidents in a story. According to James Scott Bell, "Sometimes a writer tells as a shortcut, to move quickly to the meaty part of the story or [[scene (fiction)|scene]]. Showing is essentially about making scenes vivid. If you try to do it constantly, the parts that are supposed to stand out won't, and your readers will get exhausted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Orson Scott Card===

[[Scene (drama)|Scenes]] that are important to the story should be dramatized with showing, but sometimes what happens between scenes can be told so the story can make progress. According to [[Orson Scott Card]] and others, "showing" is so terribly time consuming that it is to be used only for dramatic scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In general, '''spectacle''' refers to an event that is memorable for the appearance it creates. Derived in [[Middle English]] from c. 1340 as "specially prepared or arranged display" it was borrowed from [[Old French]] ''spectacle'', itself a reflection of the [[Latin]] ''spectaculum'' "a show" from ''spectare'' "to view, watch" frequentative form of ''specere'' "to look at."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=spectacle&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymological Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''spectacle'' has also been a [[term of art]] in theater dating from the 17th century in English [[drama]].
==The masque and spectacle==
Court [[masque]]s and masques of the nobility were most popular in the [[James I of England|Jacobean]] and [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] era.  Such masques, as their name implies, relied heavily upon a non-verbal theater.  The character lists for masques would be quite small, in keeping with the ability of a small family of patrons to act, but the [[costume]]s and theatrical effects would be lavish.  Reading the text of masques, such as ''The Masque at Ludlow'' (most often referred to as ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]''), the writing is spare, philosophical, and grandiose, with very few marks of traditional dramatic structure.  This is partially due to the purpose of the masque being family entertainment and spectacle.  Unlike ''The Masque at Ludlow'', most masques were recreations of well-known mythological or religious scenes.  Some masques would derive from tableau.  For example, [[Edmund Spenser]] (''Fairie Queene'' I, iv) describes a masque of ''The [[Seven Deadly Sins]]''.  

Masques were [[multimedia]], for they almost always involved costuming and music as a method of conveying the story or narrative.  [[Ben Jonson]], for example, wrote masques with the architect [[Inigo Jones]].  [[William Davenant]], who would become one of the major [[impresario]]s of the [[English Restoration]], also wrote pre-Revolutionary masques with Inigo Jones.  The role of the architect was that of designer of the staging, which would be elaborate and often culminate in a [[fireworks]] show.

==The Hollywood spectacular==
When the [[zoetrope]] and [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]] technology first appeared, the earliest films were spectacles.  They caught the attention of common people. They showed things people would rarely see, and they showed it to the wide audience.
* [[Thomas Edison]] filmed [[Eiffel Tower]], actual [[American Indians in the United States|American Indians]] in a simulated attack, and even celebrated [[beauty contest|beauty queens]].
* [[Louis Lumière]] filmed a train pulling into a station in 1895 (''[[L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat]]''). The camera was in front of the train, and the train "came" directly at the viewer. It astonished people unaccustomed to the illusion created by moving images.

==Spectacle and society==
Within industrial and post-industrial cultural and state formations, '''spectacle''' has been appropriated to describe appearances that are purported to be simultaneously enticing, deceptive, distracting and superficial. ([[Jonathan  Crary]]: 2005)  Current academic theories of spectacle "highlight how the productive forces of marketing, often associated with media and Internet proliferation, create symbolic forms of practice that are emblematic of everyday situations"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Alex|last2=Stringfellow|first2=Lindsay|last3=Maclean|first3=Mairi|last4=MacLaren|first4=Andrew|last5=O’Gorman|first5=Kevin|date=2015-03-24|title=Puppets of necessity? Celebritisation in structured reality television|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0267257X.2014.988282|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|volume=31|issue=5-6|pages=478–501|doi=10.1080/0267257X.2014.988282|issn=0267-257X}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Spectacle can also refer to a society that critics describe as dominated by [[electronic media]], [[consumption (economics)|consumption]], and [[surveillance]], reducing citizens to spectators by political neutralization. Recently the word has been associated with the many ways in which a [[capitalist]] structure is purported to create play-like celebrations of its products and leisure time consumption. The work of French Marxist thinker [[Guy Debord]] is perhaps the best-known example of this critical analysis; see his ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1967)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14614">'''Sports Phone''' was a telephone service in the United States that allowed users to hear sports scores and information. The service was launched in 1972, and after initially failing it was relaunched three years later. The service gained a following, and by 1981 had hit a peak of 50 million calls in a year. Sports Phone began in New York City, but expanded to offer programming in numerous other locations, including Chicago and Detroit. The rise of [[sports radio]] stations and [[News ticker|score tickers]] on television broadcasts helped reduce the popularity of Sports Phone, before an increase in Internet usage led to its demise in 2000.

Callers to Sports Phone heard messages of one minute or less, with up to 30 scores provided in a given update. In addition to scores, the service's programming included news and interviews, along with a sports trivia game. Some information was recorded specifically for certain markets. The announcers for Sports Phone included future broadcasters of several franchises in the major U.S. sports leagues.

==History==
Sports Phone was first introduced on November 1, 1972, after a month of service testing. The original owner was [[New York Telephone]] employee Jack Goodfellow. Customers were charged 10 cents per one-minute phone call, with New York Telephone the recipient of all charges and a fee from Sports Phone for each call. Goodfellow's intention was for the service to make money from advertisements included with the service's updates, but the business model proved unsuccessful. In 1973, Air Time Inc., a media entity, purchased rights to the service. New York Telephone later allowed for information service operators to retain part of the call fees, and Sports Phone was relaunched in 1975.&lt;ref name="thing"&gt;{{cite web|last=DeLessio|first=Joe|title=That Was a Thing: Sports Phone, the 1980s Way to Get Real-Time Scores|publisher=Grantland|date=February 24, 2015|url=http://grantland.com/the-triangle/that-was-a-thing-sports-phone-the-1980s-way-to-get-real-time-scores/|accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The service used multiple telephone numbers, including at least one alternate number, but the most well-known was 976-1313. Future broadcaster John Giannone claimed that, among New York City sports enthusiasts, "Everyone 45 and over can recite" the number.&lt;ref name="call"&gt;{{cite news|last=Best|first=Neil|title=Remembering Sports Phone and 976-1313: When sports info was a phone call away|work=Newsday|date=July 31, 2015|url=http://www.newsday.com/sports/media/remembering-sports-phone-and-976-1313-when-sports-info-was-a-phone-call-away-1.10695116|accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1976, Sports Phone was receiving an average of 65,000 calls daily. It appealed strongly to sports bettors, as it allowed users to access updates on games from the West Coast of the U.S., which frequently ended after broadcasts of television news programs.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; The service experienced a record period of activity in 1977, as the [[New York Mets]] were completing a trade with the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in which [[Tom Seaver]] was sent to the Reds. Sports Phone had 600,000 callers over a three-day span.&lt;ref name="big"&gt;{{cite news|last=Calabria|first=Pat|title=Sports Phone does big business|work=The Bulletin|date=July 25, 1982|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&amp;dat=19820725&amp;id=BpxTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5IYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3735,3747590|page=D3|accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth in Sports Phone's usage continued in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Daily call figures moved up to around 100,000 in 1979, with peaks of three times that figure on some weekend days when college or pro football games were being held.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; By 1981, New York Telephone was making $3&amp;nbsp;million from Sports Phone over a year; 50 million calls were made to Sports Phone that year; the only Dial-it service that received more activity was the one for [[off-track betting]].&lt;ref name="big"/&gt; The service expanded to markets outside New York City as well. In 1977, Sports Phone introduced a line with updates that focused on Chicago; two years later, Detroit received its own line.&lt;ref name="line"&gt;{{cite news|last=Craig|first=Jack|title=Sports Phone on Line: Please Deposit 50 Cents|work=The Boston Globe|date=June 26, 1988|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Jersey and Buffalo were later added as markets with their own numbers.&lt;ref name="big"/&gt; Daily call numbers in Chicago had hit around 65,000 by 1984, although they reportedly peaked at 175,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brogan|first=Dan|title=C'mon, ring their bell: Knowing the scores is Sports Phone's calling|work=Chicago Tribune|date=March 19, 1984|page=E14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports Phone had competition in the field by 1983, as a three-year-old national rival service, Dial-It, was receiving approximately 350,000 calls weekly.&lt;ref name="score"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Lidz|first=Franz|title=If You Don't Know the Score, Sports Phone Services Will Give it to You|magazine=Sports Illustrated|date=April 25, 1983|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1983/04/25/643779/if-you-dont-know-the-score-sports-phone-services-will-give-it-to-you|accessdate=June 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1985, Sports Phone's business model had changed, as its parent company, Phone Programs, was earning 2 cents per call from New York Telephone and making more than $1&amp;nbsp;million in revenue; this replaced a previous model in which Sports Phone received payments from [[AT&amp;T]] before the [[breakup of the Bell System]]. Atlanta, Miami, and New Orleans had updates that were aimed at those markets by 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Blauner|first=Peter|title=Sports Fix|magazine=New York|date=January 7, 1985|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=17YBAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calls to Sports Phone numbers cost 50 cents by 1986. The service was facing increasing competition nationally from providers such as JD's National Score Phone, Dial Sports, and a line from ''[[USA Today]]''. Sports Phone indicated that it planned to increase call lengths to 90 seconds following the beginning of the football schedule; this matched the time of Dial Sports' calls, which cost customers 10 cents less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wernie|first=Bradford|title=Sports Phone Services Score With Results-Hungry Fans|work=Crain's Detroit Business|date=August 11, 1986|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A radio station dedicated to [[Sports radio|sports programming]], [[WFAN (AM)|WFAN]], debuted in New York City in 1987. The initial concept for the station included score updates every 15 minutes, which were inspired by Sports Phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=French|first1=Alex|last2=Kahn|first2=Howie|title=The Sound and the Fury|publisher=Grantland|date=July 11, 2012|url=http://grantland.com/features/don-imus-mike-mad-dog-fall-rise-first-all-sports-talk-station-wfan/|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; WFAN positioned itself to compete against Sports Phone for the attention of the service's callers. One of the station's first promotional advertisements contained the line "We just made Sports Phone old news."&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; Sports Phone employee Cory Eisner said, "We knew right away (WFAN) was going to come after us."&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; At the same time that sports radio was reducing the service's business, it was affected by an increase in the use of [[pager]]s by sports bettors and a rise in number blocks by businesses in the New York City region.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; Television stations also moved to provide scores to viewers, as both [[CBS]] and [[NBC]] added periodic score updates to their pro football telecasts.&lt;ref name="line"/&gt;

A Boston-area number was introduced in 1988, to coincide with the [[Mike Tyson vs. Michael Spinks]] heavyweight championship fight. Services were also provided to the Cleveland and Phoenix markets, but proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="line"/&gt; By 1990, Sports Phone had received nearly one billion calls over the service's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Kanner|first=Bernice|title=Hot Lines|magazine=New York|date=September 24, 1990|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmeBLxJqbN8C&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, though, cable television sports stations were providing score updates. In future years, the Internet would offer scores and news in real time. Caller activity at Sports Phone fell to 1,000 or less daily. The service's last general manager, radio broadcaster [[Don La Greca]], said of Sports Phone's decline, "Technology that helped us update then became available to the general public, and so there was no reason to have us."&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; The service was shut down in 2000.&lt;ref name="call"/&gt;

==Programming==
In the earliest incarnation of Sports Phone, each one-minute call allowed the caller to hear 46 seconds of sports scores. The remaining 14 seconds of the call were taken up by two commercials, each of which lasted seven seconds.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; When the service was reintroduced in 1975, the length of a call fell to between 57 and 58 seconds.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="call"/&gt; The reduction in time allowed customers to hang up within 60 seconds, the length of a message unit as defined by the [[Federal Communications Commission]].&lt;ref name="score"/&gt; Recordings were not extended in cases when the announcers had not finished reciting scores; as many as 30 game scores could be fit into the required time frame. Updated score readings were usually done approximately once every 10 to 15 minutes through the conclusion of a night's sports events.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; For Sundays in which pro football was being played, the rate was much quicker, with just two minutes between updates. Sports Phone announcers initially received scores through [[ticker tape]], but later placed employees in press boxes at events for quicker reporting times.&lt;ref name="call"/&gt; Reporters who cooperated with Sports Phone by providing updates were paid at a rate of $20 per night; alternatively, staffers at Sports Phone would place calls into press boxes seeking updates.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; Employees also sought to record interviews with players, which were incorporated in Sports Phone's updates. Some interviews were recorded on-site, while others were done by announcers at the service's headquarters; the latter approach was used in 1976 by [[Howie Rose]], who interviewed hockey player [[Darryl Sittler]] after he had posted a 10-point game.&lt;ref name="call"/&gt; 

Sports Phone had various kinds of filler programming that it aired during days, when there were generally fewer sporting events to report on than nights. In the beginning, updates in the daytime were recorded less frequently than during the night, at 30-minute intervals. Along with updates on baseball games that were in progress, announcers incorporated news and editorial content, in addition to interviews.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; During the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike]], when Sports Phone was suffering from a lack of content, the service reported the results of a fictional best-of-seven series between the [[1961 New York Yankees season|1961 New York Yankees]] and [[1969 New York Mets season|1969 New York Mets]], which was simulated with the [[Strat-O-Matic]] tabletop game. According to announcer [[Mike Walczewski]], the series led to a 400 percent spike in Sports Phone's call volume.&lt;ref name="call"/&gt; By 1982, daytime updates had been sped up to occur about every 15 minutes. Other information that the service provided included statistics, [[harness racing]] results, and listings of [[pitcher]]s in upcoming baseball games. One other type of programming that gained a following was a sports trivia game known as the "Quickie Quiz".&lt;ref name="call"/&gt;&lt;ref name="big"/&gt; An announcer asked a trivia question during an update, and callers contacted a different phone number to answer.&lt;ref name="big"/&gt; Winners were given 15 seconds of air time on a Sports Phone update to discuss a topic of their choice.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt;

Some content was added in certain locations' updates to appeal to the local markets. Different sports were mentioned in updates, along with reports on teams of local interest.&lt;ref name="big"/&gt; This included listings of golf course and tennis court wait times as well.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; The New York City operations center handled updates for multiple cities in the southern part of the U.S.&lt;ref name="call"/&gt;

As the popularity of Sports Phone started to decline, a new feature was launched that provided more detailed play-by-play information on games. Customers were charged 99 cents per minute for the calls, which did not have the regular service's time limit. La Greca once provided three consecutive hours of baseball play-by-play to one caller; the announcer stated that the target market for the play-by-play line was "the degenerate gambler."&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; In the final years of Sports Phone's existence, announcers often obtained score information on the Internet before recording updates.&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt;

==Announcers==
Writer Joe DeLessio described Sports Phone as "a launching pad for young voices looking to break into broadcasting."&lt;ref name="thing"/&gt; The employees who announced updates for the service included future television broadcasters of the Mets and [[New York Yankees]] baseball clubs, and the [[New Jersey Devils]] and [[New York Islanders]] of the [[National Hockey League]].&lt;ref name="call"/&gt; La Greca, after beginning his career at Sports Phone, became a radio broadcaster for the [[New York Rangers]] and an [[ESPN Radio]] host in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sullivan|first=Tim|title=Imus, Mike and the Mad Dog, &amp; Doris from Rego Park: The Groundbreaking History of WFAN|publisher=Triumph Books|year=2013|pages=107–108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UTYFAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107|isbn=978-1-60078-828-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mets announcer [[Howie Rose]], who began working for Sports Phone in 1975, likened his position to "anchoring the ''CBS Evening News''".&lt;ref name="call"/&gt;

A steady stream of announcers at the service's New York City operations came from [[Fordham University]]. Future Yankees television announcer [[Michael Kay (sports broadcaster)|Michael Kay]] and [[New York Giants]] radio voice [[Bob Papa]] were among the Fordham attendees who later announced for Sports Phone.&lt;ref name="call"/&gt; Some Sports Phone announcers who provided updates to southern locations, including Papa, applied pseudonyms in an effort "to sound less ethnic."&lt;ref name="call"/&gt;

A '''talent show''' is an event in which participants [[performing arts|perform the arts]] of [[singing]], [[dancing]], [[lip sync|lip-syncing]], [[acting]], [[martial arts]], playing an [[musical instrument|instrument]], or other activities to showcase [[skill]]s. Many talent shows are performances rather than contests, but some are actual contests. In the instance of a contest, participants may be motivated to perform for a reward, trophy, or prize of some kind. For example, a [[high school]] might not have many students with any interest in performing in front of the student body for the sole purpose of performing alone and may offer different prizes as an incentive for these students to participate in the contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parke |first=Beverly N. |title=Discovering Programs for Talent Development |year=2003 |publisher=Corwin Press |location=[[Thousand Oaks, California]] |isbn=978-0-7619-4613-7|pages=131–32 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=71ysy1gOEcMC&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=%22talent%20shows%22&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==

Since the late 1980s, talent shows have become a notable genre of [[reality television]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Redden|first=Guy|title=Exposing Lifestyle Television: The Big Reveal|year=2008|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-1-4094-9286-3|pages=129–144|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=YNJN-tolIwEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=%22talent+show%22&amp;ots=I7uqlYNPUs&amp;sig=jQ6A2VBPiX_e2DB63bJI0mzSx4o#v=onepage&amp;q=%22talent%20show%22&amp;f=false|chapter=Making Over the Talent Show}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''[[Notun Kuri]]'' (1976), ''[[Popstars]]'' (1999), ''[[Star Academy]]'' (2001), [[Idols (TV series)|''Idol'']] (2001), ''[[The X Factor]]'' (2004), ''[[So You Think You Can Dance]]'' (2005), ''[[Got Talent]]'' (2006), ''[[The Voice (TV series)|The Voice]]'' (2010), ''[[Rising Star (TV series)|Rising Star]]'' (2013), ''[[Tri Akkorda (Russian Talent Show)]] (2014)'' and ''[[The Four: Battle for Stardom]] (''2018'')'', which have been critical in catapulting some amateur artists to stardom and resulting in their commercially successful careers.

==Non-competitive talent shows for troubled youths==
Talent shows can be seen as a way to help boost the self-esteem, confidence, and assurance of youth. Some communities and companies see talent shows as a way to help prevent [[juvenile delinquency]] among children, teens, and young adults. As a result, these communities create programs such as ''Girls Only!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Girls Only! Toolkit|url=http://www.sdcda.org/office/girlsonlytoolkit/toolkit/girls-only-toolkit.pdf|website=San Diego District Attorney's Office|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528165206/http://www.sdcda.org/office/girlsonlytoolkit/toolkit/girls-only-toolkit.pdf|archivedate=2015-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[San Diego]] to promote the growth of these otherwise trouble youth to better the community. Such programs are created with the hope to prevent youth from the possibilities of entering delinquency or lives of crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Girls Only!

'''''La Société du Spectacle''''' ('''''Society of the Spectacle''''') is a black and white 1973 film by the [[Situationist International|Situationist]] [[Guy Debord]] based on his 1967 [[Society of the Spectacle|book of the same name]]. It was Debord's first feature-length film. It uses [[Found footage (appropriation)|found footage]] and [[détournement]] in a radical [[Marxist]] [[critique]] of [[mass marketing]] and its role in the [[Social alienation|alienation of modern society]].

==Film content==
The 88 minute film took a year to make and incorporates an apparent jumble of footage from feature films juxtaposed with still photographs, industrial films, early 1970s glossy 'lifestyle' TV ads, and news footage of unrest in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6113599464218751854 The pussies of Guy Debord]'', selected excerpts from the film&lt;/ref&gt; The feature films include ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'', ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World|October]]'', ''[[Chapaev (film)|Chapaev]]'', ''[[The New Babylon]]'', ''[[The Shanghai Gesture]]'', ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'', ''[[Rio Grande (film)|Rio Grande]]'', ''[[They Died with Their Boots On]]'', ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'', and ''[[Mr. Arkadin]]'', as well as other Soviet films.

Throughout the film, there are intertitles consisting of quotations from ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'', along with Debord (in voice-over) reading texts from [[Marx]], [[Machiavelli]], the 1968 [[Occupation Committee of the Sorbonne]], [[Tocqueville]], [[Émile Pouget]], and [[Sergey Solovyov]] and others. Without citations, these quotes are hard to decipher, especially with the conflicting subtitles (which exist even in the French version): but that is part of Debord's goal to "problematize reception" (Greil and Sanborn) and force the viewer to be active. In addition, the words of some of the authors are [[détournement|détourned]] through deliberate misquoting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notbored.org/SOTS-detournements.html Guide to the détournements in ''The Society of the Spectacle'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Footage of historical events is included, such as the murder of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] (the assassin of U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1963), the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936-1939, the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Hungarian Revolution]] and the [[May 1968 in France|Paris riots]] in May 1968, along with clips of people such as [[Mao Zedong]], [[Richard Nixon]] and the Spanish anarchist [[Durruti]].

In 1984, Debord withdrew his films from circulation because of the negative press and the assassination of his friend and patron [[Gerard Lebovici]]. Since Debord's suicide in 1994, Debord's wife [[Alice Becker-Ho]] has been promoting Debord's film. A DVD box set titled ''Guy Debord: Oeuvres cinématographiques complètes'' was released in 2005 and contains Debord's seven films.

==Music==
The piece used in the film is [http://petrucci.mus.auth.gr/imglnks/usimg/9/9e/IMSLP74228-PMLP148883-Corrette_Délices.pdf#page=22 ''Les Delices de la Solitude'', Op. 20 No. 6] - Sonata in D Major : I. ''Allegro Moderato'', by [[Michel Corrette]].

'''''The Three Bogatyrs''''' (Три богатыря) is an [[Animation|animated]] [[Franchising|franchise]] produced by [[Melnitsa Animation Studio]]. Voices of [[Sergey Makovetsky]], [[Dmitry Vysotsky]], [[Liya Medvedeva]], [[Valery Soloviev]], [[Oleg Kulikovich]], [[Oleg Tabakov]], [[Anatoly Petrov]], [[Andrei Tolubeyev]] and [[Fedor Bondarchuk|Fyodor Bondarchuk]] with [[Elizaveta Boyarskaya]] are featured in the films. The overall plot through the series follows the adventures of three most famous [[bogatyr]]s: [[Alyosha Popovich]], [[Dobrynya Nikitich]] and [[Ilya Muromets]].

The series has now grossed over $135 million, making it the most high-grossing Russian animated films and earning a spot as one of the most profitable Russian films in the last 10 years.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

This animated film is anachronistic, following the lead of the other films in this series. Set in medieval times, this film combines history of [[Kievan Rus|early Russia]] and Slavic and [[Russian folklore]] with more modern elements including a nod to [[Alexander Pushkin]] and video games. Each of the first three films featured one of the [[bogatyr]]s, Russian epic heroes, based very loosely on the heroes in the legends about [[Prince Vladimir]] in the Kievan-Rus’ bylina cycle, a collection of traditional Russian oral epic narrative poems. The fourth film, The Three Bogatyrs and the Shamakhan Queen, unites all three of the bogatyrs, Alyosha Popovich, Ilya Muromets and Dobrynya Nikitych, in one film and includes unforgettable sidekicks such as Julius the talking horse, introduced in the previous films. Unlike the other three animated features, this film also makes reference to the Russian literature from 19th century and the famous narrative epic of Alexander Pushkin: [[The Tale of the Golden Cockerel]] (Сказка о золотом петушке, 1834) with the addition of the Shamakhan Queen.

The commercial success of this series has been increasing since the release of the first film in 2004, in part, because of such marketing.

The Three Bogatyrs and the Shamakhan Queen or How Not to Rescue a Princess is the fourth film in the animated series and was released December 30, 2010.

The DVD was released on 17 February 2011 and during the first six weeks made 566,731,786 rubles, breaking the record for Russian animated films and earning a spot as one of the most profitable Russian films in the last 10 years.

===''Three Heroes on Distant Shores'' (2012)===
{{Main|Three Heroes on Distant Shores}}
In English-speaking countries it was distributed as "Three Bogatyrs far far away", which was commercially successful despite rather negative reviews.

Kolyvan and Baba Yaga plan to take over the palace of the Prince of Kiev. They succeed in their attempt with the help of a singular army—two enormous bunnies. They also create a fake source of legitimation, the doubles of the three bogatyrs, who affirm that the charlatans are the legitimate successors of the Prince. In the meantime, with the help of further magic, Baba Yaga banishes the real bogatyrs to a remote shore. The plot develops through various episodes involving the impostors with their bunnies, the Prince of Kiev with the horse Iulii, the bogatyrs’ wives with the doubles, the real bogatyrs with the indigenous people and a giant gorilla, and the appearance of some characters from the previous series—Tikhon, babka and the dragon Gorynych.

The film is perhaps most successful in presenting a straight criticism on Russian society and rulers. A satire that is undoubtedly addressed at contemporary Russia, but that has in itself recurrent traits of satirical works emerging at different times during the Russian and Soviet era: infatuation with foreign products, blind awe towards foreigners, ineptitude of the rulers to govern, corruption, unfair tax collection, high prices on produce, and swift acceptance of new impostors without any opposition. This type of satirical accent acquires even more weight when followed by shots of nationalist characters, such as the beautiful domes of the village that assume different colors from the reflection of the rising sun.

To the contrary of many contemporary foreign animated films, Three Bogatyrs relies more on traditional, drawn animation than on computer graphics. As in many animation movies made in Russia, characters and scenes are first drawn, scanned, and only then do computer animators fill in the tasks of coloring, adding  backgrounds and special effects. Computers help the construction of the film and offer some special features, but the process of drawing successfully preserves the film from the cold and artificial effect that is common to pure computer animation.

===''Three heroes. Horse Course'' (2015)===
{{Main|Three heroes. Horse Course}}
Known also as "Roundabout way and new adventures of ancient Bogatyrs".

Court horse named Julius Caesar is at the hub of activity. The horse is supposed to save the grand duke of Kiev while the Bogatyrs are absent trying to catch the robber. The evil goes further eventually planning to take over not ancient Russia but over the whole world.
The villain is represented by a living oak tree who gambles and outplays simpletons. The second bad guy is a robber named Potanya.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7204">A '''theatrical séance''' is an aspect of [[mentalism]] that purports to give its audiences the feeling of contacting the spirits of the dead, as might be experienced in a successful [[seance|Spiritualist séance]].

Theatrical séances are usually performed in either total or partial darkness to replicate the atmosphere of a traditional [[seance]], to set the mood for the performance, and to hide the methods of the performer. Performance-goers may be treated to a variety of [[mentalism]] demonstrations during a theatrical séance include examples of [[clairvoyance]], [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]], [[precognition]] and [[telekinesis]], in addition to or in preparation of apparent [[mediumship]].

== Popular examples of theatrical séances ==

Theatrical séances are very popular at [[Halloween|Hallowe'en]] and are often offered for fright value. Private magic cabarets may offer this type of performance, including:

The [[Dorothy Dietrich]] and [[Dick Brooks (magician)|Dick Brooks]] Psychic Theater in [[Scranton]] [[Poconos]] offers theatrical séances year round. Its production of "Haunted! Mysteries of THE Beyond!" is one of the longest running performances of its type having started in 2003.  The Fall 2008 issue of the Pennsylvania Pursuits Magazine &lt;ref name="Pennsylvania Pursuits"&gt;{{cite book
  | author = Christen Gruebel
  | title = Pursuits Magazine, Top 10 most Haunted Places
  | year = 2008
  | publisher = Pennsylvania Tourism Office, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
  | issue = Vol 5, Issue 3 
  | pages = 56, 57, 58, 59, 60
}}&lt;/ref&gt; put out by the Pennsylvania Tourism Office of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania picked the location of Psychic Theater at 1433 N. Main Avenue in Scranton, Pennsylvania as one of the 10 most haunted places in Pennsylvania, placing it at number 9.

The [[Houdini Museum]] offers yearly Houdini séances geared specifically toward "contacting [[Houdini]]." The original Houdini séances were done by Houdini's wife Beatrice (Bess) for ten years after Houdini died.  She found doing the Houdini séance each year very stressful, possibly hoping against hope that if anyone could escape from the other side and return in a séance, it would be Houdini. At the end of ten years she passed the honor, legacy and tradition of doing the Houdini seances to friend, confidant and Houdini ghost writer, [[Walter B. Gibson]].  She announced "ten years is long enough to wait for any man!'  Gibson was also writer of The Shadow series that became a series of pulp novels, comic books, a radio show, a TV show and a movie that starred Alec Baldwin.  From the 1970's on Gibson would attend the Houdini seances at New York's Magic Towne House, run by Dorothy Dietrich and Dick Brookz. Before Walter died he passed on the tradition to magician, escape artist and co founder with Dick Brookz of The [[Houdini Museum]] in Scranton, Pennsylvania, [[Dorothy Dietrich]].  [[Dorothy Dietrich]] continues to do the Houdini Séance each year.

A [[Houdini]] seance has been presented by [[Neil Tobin]], [[Necromancer]] at [[Excalibur (nightclub)|Excalibur nightclub]] annually since October 2001. This event is presented on behalf of the Chicago Assembly of the [[Society of American Magicians]] during the last week of October to commemorate the late magician's death; [[Houdini]] helped found the Chicago Assembly in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wgntv.trb.com/news/local/morningnews/wgntv-news-102805larrysworld,0,2750659.story?coll=wgntv-morning-news-1 Houdini's Halloween] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310222125/http://wgntv.trb.com/news/local/morningnews/wgntv-news-102805larrysworld,0,2750659.story?coll=wgntv-morning-news-1 |date=2007-03-10 }} from [[WGN-TV]] and Red Eye, October 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

A short theatrical seance also concludes [[Supernatural Chicago]], a popular [[interactive theater]] show by [[Neil Tobin]]. It is currently in its seventh straight year of performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.metromix.com/theater/review/haunting-tales-fill-late/183843/content Haunting Tales Fill Late-Night Haunt] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110922022624/http://chicago.metromix.com/theater/review/haunting-tales-fill-late/183843/content |date=2011-09-22 }} from the [[Chicago Tribune]], October 27, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Los Angeles]]' [[Magic Castle]] has a separate room dedicated to theatrical séances. [http://www.magiccastle.com/visiting/seance.cfm] Their evening séance program entitled, "Demons" is a recreation of a Victorian-era séance replete with mediumistic staples such as [[table-rapping]], [[slate (writing)]], [[spirit photography]], eerie inexplicable sounds and many other "psychic" experiments.

Another popular Theatrical Séance, this one touring theatrical stages and smaller venues, entitled Phantoms, was presented by mentalist Gregory Bishop (Edmonds), Phantoms employed items associated with, and actually belonging to, Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] and magician [[Harry Houdini]].  Phantoms, first presented in 1995, was designed for presentation in two versions.  The larger, and more family-friendly stage version, and the smaller (somewhat "scarier" version), presented in private homes and in club settings.  The larger, stage version of the show included the [[spirit cabinet]] illusion, along with a [[spirit trumpet]], [[floating table]] and various other mainstays of the Victorian séance scene.

== Ethics and legality==

Theatrical séances are not intended to be "real" séances and should only be seen as entertainment; hence the adjective, ''theatrical.'' According to Houdini, if the séance leader is honest and admits his trickery, he is a theatrical performer; if not, he is a charlatan and a fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intervalmagic.com/houdinimuseum.org/articles/1926_05.19.html Houdini in The New York Times, Hints of Seances at White House&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Ethically, a paying audience should be notified beforehand that they will be experiencing a work of interactive theater rather than an actual Spiritualist seance. Once the audience is inside the performance space, however, the performer's primary responsibility is to create a convincingly realistic theatrical experience, just as in other forms of theater. Additionally, the ambiguity of whether every manifestation is the result of deception or not may be part of the enjoyment that a theatrical seance provides.

== Spiritualistic and mediumistic performers ==

*[[Eugene Burger]] ''(creator and performer of "Hauntings")
*[[Dorothy Dietrich]] &amp; [[Dick Brooks (entertainer)]] ''(co-creator and performer/Psychic Theater)''
*[[Harry Houdini]] ''(prior to becoming a debunker of Spiritualist frauds)''
*[[Harry Kellar]] ''(With the [[Davenport Brothers]] and later in his own illusion shows)
*[[Matt the Knife]] ''(creator and Medium of the seance "Epitaph")
*[[Neil Tobin]], [[Necromancer]] ''(creator of [[Supernatural Chicago]] and Medium for The [[Houdini]] Seance at [[Excalibur (nightclub)]]
*[[Paul W. Draper]] ''(creator and performer of "Seance") at historic theaters and haunted houses seasonally

'''Thundersticks''', sometimes known as '''cheerstix''',  '''bangers''' or '''bambams''', are long, narrow plastic [[balloon]]s that are used as promotional noise makers. The noise is created when two thundersticks are struck together. They are most often used at sporting events, political rallies and concerts.

Thundersticks, known as ''makdae pungseon'' in Korea, were created by BalloonStix Korea and first used in 1994 at an [[LG Twins]] baseball game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=막대풍선이란?|url=http://www.balloonstix.com/sub/sub02_01.php|website=벌룬스틱스 코리아 주식회사|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=전태수 사장이 밝히는 막대풍선의 역사|url=http://news.donga.com/3//20081027/8649242/1|website=동아닷컴|accessdate=28 March 2017|language=ko|date=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mercer|first1=Bobby|title=ManVentions: From Cruise Control to Cordless Drills - Inventions Men Can't Live Without|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781440510748|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ehjrDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT87#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later gained popularity in [[North America]] when used by fans of the [[Los Angeles Angels|Anaheim Angels]] during the [[2002 World Series]]. Today thundersticks are used by fans of many sports teams in order to show their support, serving a similar purpose as the [[Homer Hanky]] associated with the [[Minnesota Twins]] and the [[Terrible Towel]] associated with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].

Thundersticks have appeared around the world at many sporting events. They are regularly seen in baseball games in [[Taiwan]],basketball games in [[The Philippines]], and [[association football|football]] matches throughout Europe, but sometimes under different names such as "cheersticks" or "bangers".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Engber.

| ''Rendering of a planned highway''
|1960
|In 1960, a 49-second vector animation of a car traveling down a planned highway at 110&amp;nbsp;km/h was created at the Swedish [[Royal Institute of Technology]] on the [[BESK]] computer. The short animation was broadcast on November 9, 1961 on national television.&lt;ref name="tekniskamuseet"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.tekniskamuseet.se/lar-dig-mer/kommunikation-och-media/datorhistoriska-nedslag/svensk-datorhistoria-1960-talet/ |title= Svensk datorhistoria – 1960-talet |last= Du Rietz |first= Peter |date= 20 December 2016 |website= Tekniska museet |publisher= Tekniska museet |access-date= 17 January 2017 |quote= In front of the oscilloscope mounted a 35 mm camera with extended magazine on a custom-made stand. The camera was controlled automatically by computer, which sent a signal to the camera when a new image has been fed on the oscilloscope. In the Nordic ADB, who counted a lot and release data stewed, they had realized that they had all the coordinates to draw perspective from the driver's seat. They took as an example of this in the future how the then nyprojekterade motorway towards Nacka, outside Stockholm, would look like. With the camera in front of the oscilloscope, they could snap a picture every twenty meters of the virtual road. The result was a 30 second fictitious trip in the virtual highway at a speed of 110 km/h. The film was transferred to 16 mm format and made in 100 copies. Technical Museum is the only known surviving copy of the film in the collections. On the film roll box says that it is the first computer-drawn film in the world. There is little other evidence that this is actually true, and that this is the world's first computer animation. The film aired on the best time in the TV November 9, 1961 in news program News. |language= Swedish |trans-title= Swedish computer history - 1960s}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|XhNT501DsJI|"Världens äldsta datoranimation?"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| ''Hummingbird''
|1967
|A ten-minute computer animated film by [[Charles Csuri]] and James Shaffer. This was awarded a prize at the 4th annual International Experimental Film Competition in Brussels, Belgium and in the collection of The Museum of Modern Art, New York City.  The subject was a line drawing of a hummingbird for which a sequence of movements appropriate to the bird were programmed. Over 30,000 images comprising some 25 motion sequences were generated by the computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.siggraph.org/artdesign/profile/csuri/artworks/plot/plot9.html |title= Hummingbird, 1967 |last= Csuir |first= Charles |date= |website= ACM SIGGRAPH |publisher= ACM SIGGRAPH |access-date= 17 January 2017 |quote= We completed a ten minute computer animated film entitled Hummingbird. The subject was a line drawing of a hummingbird for which a sequence of movements appropriate to the bird were outlined. Over 30,000 images comprising some 25 motion sequences were generated by the computer. For these, selected sequences were used for the film. A micro-film plotter recorded the images directly to film. To facilitate control over the motion of some sequences, the programs were written to read all the controlling parameters from cards, one card for each frame. Curve fit or other date generating programs were used to punch the parameter decks. We also built a windowing option into our plot subroutine. }} []&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|awvQp1TdBqc|Charles Csuri, Fragmentation Animations, 1968 - 1970: Hummingbird (1968)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|1968
|A group of Soviet mathematicians and physicists headed by [[Nikolay Konstantinov|N. Konstantinov]] created a mathematically computable model of the physics of a moving cat.

[[Image:lafayette zayde-1670.gif|thumb|210px|right|Marie de LaFayette's ''Zayde'' (1670), the original context of Huet's ''Traité de l'origine des romans'']]

[[Pierre Daniel Huet]]'s '''Trai[t]té de l'origine des Romans''' (''Treatise on the Origin of [[Novel]]s'', or ''Romances'') can claim to be the first history of fiction. It was originally published in 1670 as preface to [[Marie-Madeleine Pioche de la Vergne, comtesse de la Fayette|Marie de la Fayette's]] novel ''Zayde''. The following will give extended excerpts from the English translation by Stephen Lewis published in 1715. The title page reads:

:THE| HISTORY| OF| ROMANCES.| AN| Enquiry into their ''Original''| ''Instructions for Composing them;''| AN| Account of the most Eminent| AUTHORS;| With Characters, and Curious Observations| upon the Best Performances of that Kind.| [rule]| Written in ''Latin'' by HUETIUS;| Made English by ''STEPHEN LEWIS.''| [rule]| &amp;mdash;juvat integros accedere fontes,| Atque haurire. ''Lucr.''| [rule]| ''LONDON:''| Printed for J. HOOKE, at the ''Flower-de-luce'', and| T. CALDECOTT, at the ''Sun;'' both against St.| ''Dunstan'''s Church in ''Fleetstreet.'' 1715.

Pages i-xi gave a preface by Lewis, p.[xii] added “Corrigenda”, p.&amp;nbsp;1-149 offered the translation under the short title “Original of Romances”.

The excerpt is extensive and it will mainly serve students of literature interested in the scope of questions and the method of arguing the early historian of literature showed&amp;mdash;Huet was a modern cultural historian, one could say. (The German parallel page [[:de:Traitté de l'origine des romans]] offers a summary of the plot with selected quotes and might be more comprehensive):

== Excerpt ==

===The Preface by Stephen Lewis, 1715 [p.i-xi] ===
[[File:1715 Huet History of Romances translated by Stephen Lewis.png|thumb|Stephen Lewis' translation, 1715]]
:'THERE is not any Speculation, which affords a more agreeable Pleasure to the Mind, than that of beholding from what Obscure and Mean Beginnings, the most Polite and Entertaining Arts have|&lt;j/ij&gt; risen to be the Admiration and Delight of Mankind. To pursue them up to the most abstruse Fountains, and then to view by what Steps they arise to Perfection; does not only excite an Amazement at their Increase; but an Impatient Desire of Inventing some New Subject, to be improv'd and advanc'd by Posterity.

:The first Occasion of introducing ''ROMANCE'' into the World, was, without Dispute to mollify the Rigour of Precepts, by the Allurements of Example. Where the Mind can't be subdued into Virtue, by Reason and Philosophy; nothing can|&lt;ij/iij&gt; influence it more, than to present to it the Success and Felicity, which Crowns the Pursuit of what's Great and Honourable.

The beginning of romances is to be searched for in a far distant past and of interest to “the Curious in Antiquity”

:Upon this Account, They are very much indebted to the Labour and Penetration of ''Huetius;'' who has, with great Judgement, traced the Subject he undertook to Illustrate, till he found it in|&lt;iv/v&gt; its Infancy, involved in the Umbrage of Fable, and perplexed in the Folds of ''Mystery'' and ''Riddle.'' [p.iv-v]

The treatise has found a wide audience in Latin and French translations. The new English translation is designed to attract a growing audience:

:Especially since ''Romance'' has of late convey'd it self very far into the Esteem of this Nation, and is become the Principal Diversion of the Retirement of People of all Conditions. [p.v]

===Huet's Text: The Original of Romances. [p.1-149]===

==== What is a Romance? ====

:The Name of Romance was formerly extended not only to Prose but Verse; ''Giradi'' and ''Pigra,'' in their Treatises de ''Romanzi,'' scarce mention any other, and lay down the ''Bayrdos'' and ''Arioste'' for Instances of their Opinion. But the Custom of this Age prevails to the contrary; so that we esteem nothing to be properly Romance but [[Fiction]]s of Love [[Adventure]]s, disposed into an Elegant Style in Prose, for the Delight and Instruction of the Reader.

:I call them Fictions, to discriminate them from True Histories; and I add, of Love Adventures, because Love ought to|&lt;4&gt; be the Principal Subject of ''Romance.'' It is required to be in Prose by the Humour of the Times. It must be compos'd with Art and Elegance, lest it should appear to be a rude undigested Mass, without Order or Beauty. [p.3-4]

"Instruction" is the next argument, yet Huet does not go into tedious details here. "Virtue" is placed against "Vice", "Disgrace" is to be avoided. The next step is the definition of "Romance" versus "Epic Poem". Both have one thing in common if one follows [[Aristotle]]'s definition of Poesy: they are fictional:

:[...] in several Respects there is a great Relation between them; and according to ''[[Aristotle]]'' (who informs us, That 'tis Fiction rather than Verse which makes a Poet) a Writer of Romance may be reckon'd among the Poets. ''[[Petronius]]'' tells us, That Poems are to move in great Circumference by the Ministry of the Gods, and Expressions vast and audacious; so that First, They may be looked upon as Oracles throughout, from a Spirit full of|&lt;7&gt; Fury, and then for a faithful and exact Narration.

:''Romances'' preserve a much greater Simplicity, and are not so exalted, nor have the same Figures in Invention and Expression.

:''Poems'' have more of the sublime, though they are not always confined to Probability. ''Romances'' have more of Probability, though they don't advance so far toward the Sublime.
:''Poems'' are more regular and correct in the Frame of their Contrivance, and receive less Addition from Events and Episodes than ''Romances,'' which are capable of these Accessions, because their Style is not so elevated, and they don't so far di|&lt;8&gt;sten'd the Intellect, so that they give it leave to admit a greater Number of different Ideas.

:In short, ''Poems'' make some Military Act, or Politick Conduct, their Theme, and only descant upon Love at Pleasure; whereas ''Romances,'' on the contrary, have Love for their Principal Subject, and don't concern themselves in War or Politicks, but by Accident. I speak of Regular ''Romances,'' for those in Old ''French, Spanish,'' and ''Italian,'' have generally more of the Soldier than Gallant. [p.7-8]

The differences between histories and romances are connected with the fictional status&amp;mdash;a problem is here caused by histories full of erroneous notions:

:These Works are true in the Main, and false in some Parts. ''Romances,'' on the contrary, are false in the Gross, and true in some Particulars. [...|&lt;10&gt;] I mean, that Falsehood is so predominant in ''Romance,'' that it may be altogether False in Whole and every Particular. [p.10]

Huet excludes Histories if the authors wanted to give rue accounts and just failed and he excludes "fables":

:[...] for ''Romance'' is a Fiction of Things which may, but never have happen'd; whereas the Matter of Fables is what never has, nor ever will be perform'd. [p.13]

==== An Ancient Practice: Religions Use Fictions to Create Secret Knowledge ====

The following part of the treatise touches the origin of "romances". The peoples of Asia, especially those of Egypt had, so Huet claims, proven a tendency to decipher all kinds of information. The [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]]s prove that. Their whole religion and all their histories were deciphered, mostly to exclude the population from further knowledge. Initiations were afforded before one would gain access to the secret cultural knowledge Egypt stored. The Greeks |&lt;p.&amp;nbsp;17&gt; had been extremely eager to learn from Egypt:

:'Twas without doubt from these Priests, that ''[[Pythagoras]]'' and ''[[Plato]],'' in their Voyage to ''Ægypt,'' learned to Transform their Philosophy, and hide it under the Shadow of Mystery and Disguise. [p.17]

The Arabs exploited the same cultural knowledge&amp;mdash;their [[Koran]] is, so Huet says filled with knowledge one cannot understand without interpretation. The Arabs translated Greek fables into their language and via Arabia [p.&amp;nbsp;20] these materials finally reached Europe. This is proven by the fact that only after the occupation of Spain first romances appeared in southern France. Huet discusses Persias culture&amp;mdash;as particularly obscure and full of secret knowledge, he mentions the Indians [p.&amp;nbsp;27] as particularly fond of poesy, before he speaks of the influence the ''Bible'' had on the western civilization and its love of fictions:

:The Holy Scripture is altogether Mysterious, Allegorical, and Ænigmatical. The ''[[Talmud]]ists'' are of Opinion that the ''[[Book of Job]]'' is no other than a [[Parable]] of the ''Hebrews''|&lt;32&gt; Invention; this Book, that of ''[[David]],'' the ''[[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], [[Ecclesiastes]],'' the ''[[Song of Solomon|Canticles]],'' and all other Holy Songs, are Poetical Works abounding with Figures, which would seem bold and violent in our Writings, and which are frequent in those of that Nation. The Book of Proverbs is otherwise call'd the ''Paraboles,'' because [[Proverb]]s of this sort, according to the Definition of ''[[Quintilian]],'' are only short Figures or Parables express'd in little.

:The Book of ''Canticles'' is a kind of ''[[Drama]]tic'' Poem, where the passionate Sentiments of the Bridegroom and Spouse are expressed after a Manner so tender and touching, that we|&lt;33&gt; should be charmed and affected with it, if the Expression and Figures had a little more Conformity to our Genius; or if we could Divest our selves of Prejudice, which disposes us to dislike every Thing which is the least different from what we are used to; tho' by this Practice we condemn our selves without perceiving it, since our Lightness never permits us to continue long in the Approbation of any Thing.
:Our [[Jesus|Saviour]] himself scarce ever gave any Precepts to the [[Jew]]s but under the Veil of Parables. [...] [p.33]

Huet is extremely interested in changing tastes and in the relativity of judgments&amp;mdash;he is far from any simple theory of cultural progress or decline. His concept is rather one of different functions knowledge and fictions can gain. Fables stood in the centre of his discussion so far. The next passages gain a wider perspective:

:But it is not enough to have discovered ''The Original of Romances;'' we must see by what Streams they have spread and convey'd themselves into ''Greece,'' and ''Italy,'' and whether they have passed from thence to us; or we have received them from any other Nation. [p.35]

==== Novels of Luxury: Persia, Greece and Rome ====

The ancient world developed a high cultural standard. Luxury commodities became important. Persia was the country of highest refinement, producing perfumes and dances before the Milesians imported much of that culture:

:But the ''[[Miletus|Milesians]],'' above all the rest, discover'd the indulging Temper, surpassed them all in the Accuracy of their Pleasures, and shew'd the most singular Taste for Delicacies. They were the first who introduced the Art of Romancing among the ''Persians,'' when they had had such Success in it themselves, that the ''Milesian'' fables, the same with Romances, full of Love Adventures, and Licentious Relations, advanced into the Highest Reputation: 'Tis probable Romances were Innocent 'till they fell into their hands, and before recounted only singular and memorable Adventures.

:But these were the first who corrupted them [...]

One does not have any material artefacts to prove this, yet the ancient historians help us here with their accounts. The [[Ionia]]ns influenced the Greeks. [[Alexander the Great]] did much to widen their cultural concepts. The ''Milesian Fables'' by [[Aristides of Miletus]] were finally translated into Latin. The book was criticized in Rome's Senate as hardly serving the purposes of a Rome involved in wars.

Huet mentions names and develops a canon of texts and reaches Heliodorus who has to be compared with [[Jamblicus]], the author of the Babylonics, which have only survived in fragments:

:''[[Heliodorus of Emesa|Heliodorus]]'' excell'd him in the Desposition of his Subject, and indeed in every other Particular. Hitherto the World had not seen any thing better designed, and more compleat in Romance, than the Adventures of ''Theagenes'' and ''Chariclia:'' Nothing can be more chaste than their Loves. By this it appears, (beside the Honour of the Christian Reli|&lt;50&gt;gion which he professed) that he had in his own Nature such an Air of Virtue, as shines throughout the Work; in which not only ''Jambicus,'' but almost all the rest, are much his Inferiors. His Merit advanc'd him to the Dignity of an Episcopal See: He was Bishop of Tricca, a City of ''[[Thessaly]]. [[Socrates Scholasticus|Socrates]]'' reports, that he introduced into that Diocese, the Custom of Deposing such of the Clergy, as did not abstain from the Women they had contracted before their Admission into Orders. This makes me very much suspect what ''[[Saint Nicephorus|Nicephorus]],'' a credulous Writer, of little Judgement or Sincerity relates; That a Provincial Synod, understanding|&lt;51&gt; the Danger which the Reading this Romance (so highly Authorised by the Dignity of its Author) might expose Young People to; proposed, that he should either consent to the Burning of his Book, or the Resignation of his Bishoprick; and that he accepted the latter of the Conditions.[p.51]

[[Achilles Tatius]]' ''[[Leucippe and Clitophon]]'' enters the canon, and Huet is uncertain about the chronology of events:

:However, he is not to be compared to ''Heliodorus,'' either for the Regularity of his Manners, the Variety of Events, or the Artifice of Unraveling his Plots. Indeed his Style is to be preferr'd to that of ''Heliodorus,'' because 'tis more Simple and natural; whereas the other's is more forced. Some say, that he was a Christian, and a Bishop too. 'Tis strange, that the Obscenity of his Book should be so easily forgot; and more so, that the [[Leo VI the Wise|Emperor Leo VI]], sirnamed the ''Philosopher,'' should commend the Modesty of it, in an Epigram which is yet extant; and not only permit but recommend the Reading of it with the clo|&lt;54&gt;sest Application, to all those who profess the Love of Chastity. [p.54]

Then, referring to Longos and his ''Daphnis and Chloe:''

:My Judgement upon the Pastorals of ''Longus'' the Sophist, is the same with that I gave of the Two former Romances. For|&lt;78&gt; tho' the Learned of Late Times have commended them for their Elegance and Agreement, joined to a Simplicity proper to the Nature of the Subjects; yet I can observe nothing in it, but that Simplicity, which sometimes declines to Childishness and Impertinence. There is nothing in it of Invention, or Conduct. He begins grosly in the Birth of his Shepherds, and ends with their Marriage. He never clears up his Adventures, but by Machines improper, and ill contrived. His Expressions are so obscene, that one must be somewhat a ''Cynic,'' to read them without Blushing. His Style does not deserve the Commen|&lt;79&gt;dations it receives. 'Tis the Style of a Sophist, such as he was [...] which partakes of the Orator and Historian, tho' it be proper for neither of them. 'Tis full of ''Metaphors,'' ''Antitheses,'' Figures, which dazzle and surprise the Simple, and tickle the Ear, without satisfying the Mind; instead of Engaging the Reader, by the Novelty of Events, the Arrangement of Variety of Matter, a clear and close Narration, attended by a smooth and regular Cadence, which always advances within the Subject.

:He endeavours (as all Sophists do) to entertain his Reader with Accidental Descripti|&lt;81&gt;ons: He leads him out of the way; and while he admits him so far into a Country he did not look for, he spends and exhausts the Attention and Impatience he had to arrive at the End he proposed. [p.80]

Rome does not play more than a marginal role. Huet mentions "Sybaritian Fables" and the love fiction of Ovid, yet only Petronius wrote something like a "romance" in Latin. Ovid mentions a Roman esteem of romances, Huet's comment:

:Hence appears the Esteem Romances had in Rome; which is more evident, by the Romance which ''Petronius'' (one of their Consuls, and the most polished Man of his Time) composed. He disposed it into the|&lt;93&gt; Form of a ''Satyr,'' of the same Kind which ''Varro'' invented, intermixing Prose with Verse, the Serious with the Jocose, and stiled it ''Menippean;'' because ''Menippus'' had before treated of Serious Matters in a Pleasant Style.

:This Satyr of ''Petronius'' fails not to be a True Romance: It contains nothing but diverting and ingenious Fictions, tho' they are sometimes too licentious and immodest. He hides under a Disguise a fine and poignant Raillery, against the Vices of Nero's Court. What remains of it, are some incoherent Fragments, or rather Collections of some industrious Person; so that one can't exactly discern|&lt;94&gt; the Form and Connexion of the whole Piece; tho' it appears to be conducted with Order. And 'tis probable those incoherent Parts, would compose a very Compleat Body, with the Addition of those which are lost. Tho' ''Petronius'' seems to be a very great Critic, and of an exquisite Taste in Learning; his Style does not always advance to the Delicacy of his Judgement: Something of Affectation may be observed. In some Places he's too Florid and Adorned; and degenerates from that Natural and Majestic Simplicity, which shined in the ''Agustan'' Age. [p.94]

==== The Northern Tradition: Fictions of a Dark Age of Ignorance ====

The ancient authors excelled with satires and texts which are no longer extant&amp;mdash;a history which ended in darkness with the invasion of Germanic tribes causing the fall of the Roman empire:

:Hitherto the Art of Romancing was maintained with some Splendor, but it soon decayed with Learning and the Empire; when the Furious nations of the ''North'' disseminated, with their Bodies, the Ignorance and barbarity of their Minds. Romances were hitherto composed for|&lt;101&gt; Delight. Fabulous Histories were now introduced, because none were acquainted with the Truth. ''Taliessin,'' who lived about the Middle of the Sixth Age, under that King ''Arthur'' so famous in Romances; and ''Melkin,'' who was somewhat younger, writ the History of ''England,'' his Country, of King ''Arthur,'' and the ''Round Table. Balæus,'' who has put them in his Catalogue, speaks of them, as of Authors filled with Fables. The same may be said of ''Hunibaldus Francus,'' who (as some relate) was Contemporary with ''Clovis,'' and whose History is no other but a Mass of Lies grossly conceived. [p.101]

The present age&amp;mdash;the late 17th century&amp;mdash;has learned to live with a differentiation between fiction and fact. The Middle Ages were marked by a completely different frame of mind. Huet reaches the stories written about king Arthur and Merlin:

:[...] those which contained the Atchievements of King Arthur, and the Life of ''Merlin.''|&lt;104&gt;

:These Diverting Histories pleased the Readers, who were more ignorant than those who composed them. They did not, in those Days, trouble themselves with Researches into Antiquity, and after being informed of the Truth of what they wrote. They had the Stuff in their own Head, and went no farther than their own Invention. Thus Historians degenerated into True Romancers.

:In this Age of Ignorance, the Latin Tongue, as well as Truth, was neglected and despised. The Versifiers, Composers, Inventers of tales, Jesters, and in short, all of this Country who studied what they called the Gay Science, began about the Time of Hugh|&lt;105&gt; ''Capet,'' to set upon Romancing with great Fury; and soon over-ran France, by dispersing them. These Fables were composed in the Roman Tongue [...]

The term romance was now invented&amp;mdash;to denote the Spanish and French Language these texts were written in:

:The ''Spaniards'' use the Word ''Romance'' in the same Signification with us, and call their ordinary Language by that Name. The ''Romain'' being then most universally understood, those of ''Provence'' who apply'd themselves to Fictions, made use of it in their Writings, which from thence were called ''Romances.'' [p.106]

The idea of a tradition coming via Spain to Europe is thus balanced by a second option: [p.&amp;nbsp;108-09] Taliessin and Melkin were English heroes, Huet notes. The romances touching them must have been composed originally around 550.

==== Where Traditions Met: Europe and Another Theory of the Anthropology of Fiction ====

The development into the 17th century gives the ''Amadis of Gaul'' a central position [p.&amp;nbsp;114-16] and leads to Cervantes ''Don Quixote''&amp;mdash;which is rather a critic of "romances" than a romance itself.
The following long passage gives Huet's picture of the intellectual network behind the rise of the modern novel&amp;mdash;and of the traditions which now met:

:All ''Europe'' was then overwhelmed with Darkness and Ignorance, but ''France, England,'' and ''Germany'' much less than ''Italy,'' which then produced but a small Number of Writers, and scarce any Authors of Romances. Those of that Country, who had a Mind to distinguish themselves by Learning and Knowledge, came for it to the University of ''Paris,'' which was the Mother of Sciences, and Nurse of the Learning of ''Europe.'' St.&amp;nbsp;''Thomas Aquinas,'' St.&amp;nbsp;''Bonaventure,'' the Poets ''Dante,'' and ''Boccace,'' came thither to study; and the President ''Fauchet'' produces, that the last of them took a great Part of his Novels from ''French'' Ro|&lt;121&gt;mances; and that ''Petrarch,'' and the other ''Italian'' Poets, have rifled for their Richest Fancies, the Songs of ''Thiband'' King of Navarre, ''Gace's Brussez, Chastelain de Corcy,'' and the Old ''French'' Romances. 'Twas then, in my Opinion, that the ''Italians'' learned from us the Science of Romance; which, by their own Confession, is to be ascribed to us, as well as that of Rhyming.

:Thus ''Spain'' and ''Italy'' received from us an Art, which was the Effect of our Ignorance and Barbarity, and which the Politeness of the Persians, Ionians, and Greeks had produced. As Necessity engages us, to sustain our Bodies|&lt;122&gt; with Herbs an Roots; so when the Knowledge of Truth, which is the Proper and Natural Aliment of the Mind, begins to fail, we have Recourse to Falsehood, which is the Imitation of Truth. As in Plenty we refuse Bread, and our ordinary Viands, for Ragousts; so our Minds, when acquainted with the Truth, forsake the Study and Speculation of it, to be entertained with its Image, which is Fiction. This Imitation according to ''Aristotle,'' is often more agreeable than the Original it self; so that two oppositely different Paths, which are Ignorance and Learning, Rudeness and Politeness, do often conduct us to the same End; which is|&lt;123&gt; an Application to Fictions, Fables, and Romances. Hence it is, that the most Barbarous Nations are taken with Romantic Inventions, as well as the most Refined. The Originals of all the Savages of ''America,'' and particularly those of ''Peru,'' are nothing but Fables; no more are those of the Goths, which they wrote in their Ancient ''Runic'' Characters, upon great Stones; the Remains of which I my self have seen in ''Denmark.'' And if any Thing were left us of the Works, which the Bards among the Ancient ''Gauls'' composed, to eternize the Memory of their Nation, I don't question but we should find them enriched with Abundance of Fictions.

:This Inclination to Fables, which is common to all Men, is not the Result of Reason; Imitation, or Custom. 'Tis Natural to them, and has its Seat in the very Frame and Disposition of their Soul. For the Desire of Knowledge is particular to man, and distinguishes him from Beasts no less than his Reason. nay we may observe in other Creatures some Rude Impressions of this; whereas the Desire of Understanding is Peculiar to Us only.

:The Reason of this, according to my Opinion, is; because the Faculties of the Soul are too Vast an Extent, to be supplied by the Present Objects, so that 'tis obliged to|&lt;125&gt; have recourse to what's past, and to come, in Truth and in Fictions, in Imaginary Spaces and Impossibilities, for Objects to exert it self upon. The Objects of Sense fill the Desires of the Soul of Brutes, who have no farther Concern; so that we can't discover in them these restless Emotions, which continually actuate the Mind of Man, and carry it into the Pursuit of a recent Information, to proportion (if possible the Object to the Faculty; and enjoy a Pleasure resembling that which we perceive in the Appeasing a Violent Hunger, and Extinguishing a Corroding Thirst. This is that which ''Plato'' intends, in the Marriage of ''Do-''|&lt;126&gt;''rus'' and ''Penia,'' (in which Terms he would express Riches and Poverty,) which produces exquisite Pleasure. The Object is signified by Riches, which are not so but in Use and Intention; otherwise they are unfruitful and afford no Delight. The Faculty is intended by Inquietude, while 'tis separated from Riches; whereas its Union with them, supplies the Highest Satisfaction. The Case is the same with our Souls: Poverty, the same with Ignorance, is Natural to it; it sighs continually after Science; which is its Riches; and when 'tis possess'd of this Enjoyment, it feels the greatest Pleasure. But|&lt;127&gt; this Pleasure is not always equal; it often is the Purchase of much labour and Difficulty: As when the Soul applies it self to intricate Speculations, and Occult Sciences, the Matter whereof is not present to our Senses; where the Imagination, which acts with Faculity, has a Less Part in the Pursuit than the Understanding, whose Operations are more Vehement and Intense: And because Labour is naturally tedious, the Soul is not carried to Hard and Spinous Learning, unless in Prospect of some Advantage, or Hope of some remote Amusement, or else by Necessity. But the Knowledge which attracts and delights it most, is that which is acquired without|&lt;128&gt; Pain and where the Imagination alone acts on Subjects which fall under our Sense, ravish our Passions, and are great Movers in all the Affairs of Life. Such are Romances, which require no great Intention or Dispense of Mind, to understand them. No long Reasonings are exacted; the Memory is not overburthened: Nothing is demanded, but Fancy and Imagination. They move our Passions; but 'tis on purpose to sooth and calm them again: They excite neither Fear nor Compassion; [u]nless it be to display to us the Pleasure of seeing those we are afraid, or concern'd for, out of Reach of Danger or Distress. In short, all our Emo|&lt;129&gt;tions there find themselves agreeably provoked and appeased.

:'Tis hence, that those who act more by [Passion than Reason], and labour more with their Imagination than Understanding, are affected by them; tho' these other are touched by them too, but after another manner. These are touched by the Beauties of Art, which amuse the Understanding; but the former, Ignorant and Simple, are sensible of no more than what strikes upon the Imagination, and stirs their Passions. They love the Fiction, and enquire no farther. Now Fictions being nothing but Narrations, True in Appearance, and False in Reality; the Minds of the Simple, who discern on|&lt;130&gt;ly the Disguise, are pleased and highly satisfied with this Shew of Truth. But those who penetrate farther, and see into the Solid, are easily disgusted with the Falsity: So that the first love Falsehood, because it is concealed under an Appearance of Truth; the Latter are distasted with the Image of Truth, because of the Real Forgery which is couched under it; unless it be varnished with Ingenuity, Subtility, and Instruction, and recommends it self by the Excellency of Invention and Art. St&amp;nbsp;''Augustin'' makes this Observation somewhere; 'That these Falsities which carry a Signification, and suggest an Hidden Meaning, are not Lies,|&lt;131&gt; but the Figures of Truth; which the most Wise and Holy Persons, and even our ''Saviour'' himself, have used upon Honourable and Pious Occasions.'

:Since then 'tis true, that Lies commonly flow from Ignorance, and the Grossness of our Intellect; and that this Inundation of the Barbarians, who issued from the North, spread over all Europe, and plunged it into such profound Ignorance, as it could not clear it self from, within the Space of Two Ages; is it not then probable, that this Ignorance caused the same Effect in Europe, which it had produced every where besides? And is it not vain to enquire for that in|&lt;132&gt; Chance, which we find in Nature? There is then no Reason to contend, but that the French, German, and English Romances, and all the Fables of the North, are Fruits of those Countries, and not imported from Abroad: That they never had other Originals than the Histories stuffed with Falsities, and made in Obscure Ignorant Times, when there was neither Industry nor Curiosity to discover the Truth of Things, nor Art to describe it, if 'twas found: That these Histories have been well received by the Unpolished and Half-barbarous People; and that the Historians thereupon took upon them the Liberty to pre|&lt;133&gt;sent them with what was purely forged, which were the Romances.

The whole development of fiction is thus not one of continuities&amp;mdash;but one of different traditions and complex reasons why fictions develop. Huet reaches the present age and passes through numerous titles:

==== Fictions and the Modern Period ====

:I shall not undertake to [...] examine whether ''Amadis de Gaul'' were originally from ''Spain, Flanders,'' or ''France;'' and whether the Romance of ''Tiel Ulespiegel'' be a Translation from the ''German;'' or in what Language the Romance of the ''Seven Wise Men of Greece'' was first written; or that of ''Dolopathos,'' which some say was extracted from the Parables of ''Sandaber'' the ''Indian.'' Some say 'tis to be found in ''Greek'' in some Libraries; which has furnished the Matter of an ''Italian'' Book call'd ''Erastus,'' (and of many of Boccace his Novels, as the same ''Fauchet'' has remarked) which was written in ''La-''|&lt;137&gt;''tin'' by ''John Morck,'' or the Abby ''de Hauteselne,'' whereof Ancient Copies are to be seen; and translated into ''French'' by the Clerk ''Hubert,'' about the End of the Twelfth Age, and into ''High Dutch'' about Three Hundred Years afterwards; and an Hundred Years after that, from ''High Dutch'' into ''Latin'' again, by a Learned hand, who changed the Names of it, and was ignorant that the ''Dutch'' had come from the ''Latin.''
:It shall suffice if I tell you, that all these Works which Ignorance has given Birth to, carried along with them the Marks of their Original, and were no other than a Complication of|&lt;138&gt; Fictions, grossly cast together in the greatest Confusion, and infinitely short of the Excellent Degree of Art and Elegance, to which the ''French'' Nation is now arrived in Romances. 'Tis truly a Subject of Admiration, that we, who have yielded to others the Bays for ''Epic'' Poetry, and History, have nevertheless advanced these to so high a Perfection, that the Best of theirs are not Equal to the Meanest of ours.

:We owe (I believe) this Advantage to the Refinement and Politeness of our Gallantry; which proceeds, in my Opinion, from the great Liberty which the Men of ''France'' allow to the|&lt;139&gt; Ladies. They are in a manner Recluses in ''Italy'' and ''Spain;'' and separated from Men by so many Obstacles, that they are scarce to be seen, and not to be spoken with at all. Hence the Men have neglected the Art of Engaging the Tender Sex, because the Occasions of it are so rare. All the Study and Business there, is to surmount the Difficulties of Access; when this is effected, they make Use of the Time, without amusing themselves with Forms. But in ''France,'' the Ladies go at large upon their Parole; and being under no Custody but that of their own Heart, erect it into a Fort, more strong and secure than|&lt;140&gt; all the Keys, Grates, and Vigilance of the ''Douegnas.'' The Men are obliged to make a Regular and Formal Assault against this Fort, to employ so much Industry and Address to reduce it, that they have formed it into an Art scarce known to other Nations.

:'Tis this Art which distinguishes the ''French'' from other Romances, and renders the Reading of them so Delicious, that they cause more Profitable Studies to be neglected.

:The Ladies were first taken with this Lure: They made Romances their Study; and have despised the Ancient Fa|&lt;141&gt;ble and History so far, that they now no longer understand those Works, from which they received their greatest Embellishments: And lest they should blush at this Ignorance, which they find themselves so often guilty of; they perceive they had better disapprove what they don't know, than take the Pains to learn it.

:The Men, in Complaisance, have imitated them; condemned what they disliked, and call that Pedantry, which made an Essential Part of Politeness, even in ''Malherbe'''s Time. The Poets, and other ''French'' Writers who succeeded, have been constrained to submit to this Arbi|&lt;142&gt;tration; and many of them, observing that the Knowledge of Antiquity would be of no Advantage to them, have ceased to study what they durst not practise: Thus a very Good Cause has produced an Ill Effect; and the Beauty of our Romances has drawn upon them the Contempt of Good Letters, and consequently Ignorance.

:I don't, for all this, pretend to condemn the Reading of them. The Best Things in the World are attended with their Inconveniencies; Romances too may have much worse than Ignorance. I know what they are accused for: They exhaust our Devotion, and in|&lt;143&gt;spire us with Irregular Passions, and corrupt our Manner. All this may be, and sometimes does happen. But what can't Evil and Degenerated Minds  make an Ill Use of? Weak Souls are contagious to themselves, and make Poyson of every Thing. Histories must be forbidden, which relate so many Pernicious Examples; and the Fable must undergo the same Fate; for there Crimes are authorised by the Practice of the Gods. [...|&lt;144&gt;]

:Little Regard was had to Sobriety of manners, in most Part of the Greek and Old French Romances, by Reason of the Vice of the Times in which they were composed. [...] But the Modern Romances (I speak of the Good ones) are so far from this Fault, that you'll scarce find an Expression, or Word, which may shock Chaste Ears, or one single Action which may give Offence to Modesty.

:If any one object; That Love is treated of in a Manner so Soft and Insinuating, that the Bait of this Dangerous Passion invades too easily the Tender Hearts; I answer, That it is so far from being Dangerous, that it is in some Respects Necessary, that the Young People of the World should be acquainted with it; that they may stop their Ears to that which is Criminal, and be better fortified against its Artifices; and know their Conduct, in that which has an Honest and Sacred End. This is so true, that Experience lays before us, that such as are least acquainted with Love, are the most unguarded to its As|&lt;145&gt;saults, that the most Ignorant are soonest decoyed. Add to this that Nothing so much refines and polishes Wit; Nothing conduces so much to the Forming and Advancing it to the Approbation of the World, as the Reading of Romances. These are the Dumb Tutors, which succeed those of the College, and teach us how to Live and Speak by a more Persuasive and Instructive method than theirs [...]. [p.145]

Huet has with this survey reached the end of his treatise. D'Urfee and Mademoiselle de Scudery become important here:

:Monsieur ''D'Urfee'' was the first who retrieved them from Barbarity, and reduced them to Rules, in his Incomparable ''Astrea,'' The most Ingenious and Polite Work which has appeared in this Kind, and which Eclipsed the Glory which ''Greece, Italy'' and ''Spain,'' had acquired. [...|&lt;146&gt;]

:None can, without Amazement, read those which a Maid as Illustrious in her Modesty, as her Merit, has published under a Borrowed Name; depriving her self so Generously of that Glory which was her Due, and not seeking for Reward, but in her Virtue; as if while She took so much Trouble for the Honour of our Nation, She would spare that Shame to Our Sex. But Time has done her that Justice, which she had denied her self; and has informed us, that the Illustrious Bassa, Grand ''Cyrus,'' and ''Clælia,'' are the Performances of Madam de ''Scudery'' [...].

The last lines refer to the following "history" ''Zayde''&amp;mdash;which will, so Huet, deserve all praise:

:The Virtues which conduct his Reign are so Noble, and the Fortune which attend them so Surprizing, that Posterity would doubt whether it were a History, or a Romance. [p.149]

...which is the final sentence.

'''Victorian burlesque''', sometimes known as '''travesty''' or '''extravaganza''',&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'',  "the various genre terms were always applied freely", and by the 1860s their use had become "arbitrary and capricious": see [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}.  In an 1896 article on Burlesque in ''The Theatre'', the three terms are used interchangeably: see Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt; is a genre of theatrical entertainment that was popular in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England and in the New York theatre of the mid 19th century. It is a form of [[parody music|parody]] in which a well-known opera or piece of classical theatre or ballet is adapted into a broad comic play, usually a musical play, usually risqué in style, mocking the theatrical and musical conventions and styles of the original work, and often quoting or [[pastiche|pastiching]] text or music from the original work. Victorian burlesque is one of several forms of [[burlesque]].

Like [[ballad opera]], burlesques featured musical scores drawing on a wide range of music, from popular contemporary songs to operatic arias, although later burlesques, from the 1880s, sometimes featured original scores.  Dance played an important part, and great attention was paid to the staging, costumes and other spectacular elements of stagecraft, as many of the pieces were staged as [[extravaganza]]s.  Many of the male roles were played by actresses as [[breeches role]]s, purposely to show off their physical charms, and some of the older female roles were taken by male actors.

Originally short, one-act pieces, burlesques were later full-length shows, occupying most or all of an evening's programme. Authors who wrote burlesques included [[J. R. Planché]], [[H. J. Byron]], [[G. R. Sims]], [[F. C. Burnand]], [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Fred Leslie]].

==History==
Burlesque theatre became popular around the beginning of the [[Victorian era]]. The word "burlesque" is derived from the Italian ''burla'', which means "ridicule or mockery".&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', which defines the word as "That species of literary composition, or of dramatic representation, which aims at exciting laughter by caricature of the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects; a literary or dramatic work of this kind."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;Baldick, Chris. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t56.e153 "Burlesque",] ''The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', Oxford University Press, 2008. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', Victorian burlesque was "related to and in part derived from [[pantomime]] and may be considered an extension of the introductory section of pantomime with the addition of gags and 'turns'."&lt;ref name=grove&gt;[[Erich Schwandt|Schwandt, Erich]] et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque",] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another antecedent was [[ballad opera]], in which new words were fitted to existing tunes.&lt;ref&gt;Moss,  Harold Gene. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/830406 "Popular Music and the Ballad Opera",] ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'', Vol. 26, No. 3 (Autumn, 1973), pp. 365–82, University of California Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:1831 Royal Olympic.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Olympic Theatre]], for which Planché wrote ''Olympic Revels'']]
[[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] produced burlesques at the [[Olympic Theatre]] beginning in 1831 with ''Olympic Revels'' by [[J. R. Planché]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. Davenport. ''A Book of Burlesque'' (London: Henry and Co., 1891), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  In these pieces, comedy stemmed from the incongruity and absurdity of the grand classical subjects, with realistic historical dress and settings, being juxtaposed with the everyday modern activities portrayed by the actors. For example, ''Olympic Revels'' opens with the gods of Olympus in classical Greek dress playing [[whist]].&lt;ref&gt;Reinhardt, p. 541&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early burlesques, the words of the songs were written to popular music, as had been done earlier in ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''.  Later in the Victorian era, burlesque mixed [[operetta]], [[music hall]] and [[revue]], and some of the large-scale burlesque spectacles were known as [[extravaganza]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[H. J. Byron]]'s 1863 ''Il trovatore'' parody, which was labelled "a burlesque extravaganza": see Marvin, Roberta Montemorra. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3878318 "Verdian Opera Burlesqued: A Glimpse into Mid-Victorian Theatrical Culture",] ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', Vol. 15, No. 1 (March 2003), p. 42, Cambridge University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The English style of burlesque was successfully launched in New York in the 1840s by the manager and comedian William Mitchell, who had opened his Olympic Theatre in December 1839. Like the London prototypes, his burlesques included characters with nonsensical names such as Wunsuponatyme and The King of Neverminditsnamia, and made fun of all kinds of music currently being presented in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Delmer D. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/779924 "Public Music Performances in New York City from 1800 to 1850",] ''Anuario Interamericano de Investigacion Musical'', Vol. 6 (1970), pp. 5–50, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike pantomime, which aimed at all ages and classes, burlesque was aimed at a narrower, highly literate audience;&lt;ref name=tls/&gt; some writers, such as the Brough brothers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Barnabas Brough]] and his brother [[William Brough (writer)|William Brough]] wrote successful burlesques, sometimes jointly and sometimes alone. Their burlesques include ''The Enchanted Isle'' (1848), ''Medea'' (1856), ''Masaniello'' (1857), ''The Sphinx'' (1849) and ''The Last Edition of Ivanhoe'' (1850). See Dereli, Cynthia. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3577 "Brough, Robert Barnabas (1828–1860)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at a conservative middle class audience, and [[H. J. Byron]]'s success was attributed to his skill in appealing to the lower middle classes.&lt;ref name=tls&gt;Speaight, George. "All froth and bubble", ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 1 October 1976, p. 1233&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most frequent subjects for burlesque were the plays of Shakespeare and grand opera. From the 1850s onwards, burlesquing of Italian, French and, later in the century, German opera was popular with London audiences. [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[La traviata]]'' received their British premieres in 1855 and 1856 respectively; British burlesques of them followed quickly.  ''Our Lady of the Cameleon'' by [[Leicester Silk Buckingham]] and ''Our Traviata'' by William F. Vandervell (both 1857) were followed by five different burlesque treatments of ''Il trovatore'', two of them by H. J. Byron: ''Ill Treated Trovatore, or the Mother the Maiden and the Musicianer'' (1863) and ''Il Trovatore or Larks with a Libretto'' (1880).&lt;ref name=marvin&gt;Marvin,  Roberta Montemorra. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3878318 "Verdian Opera Burlesqued: A Glimpse into Mid-Victorian Theatrical Culture",] ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', Vol. 15, No. 1 (March 2003), pp. 33–66, Cambridge University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operas of [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]], [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]] were burlesqued.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;&lt;ref name=marvin/&gt; In a 2003 study of the subject, Roberta Montemorra Marvin noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
By the 1880s, almost every truly popular opera had become the subject of a burlesque. Generally appearing after an opera's premiere or following a successful revival, they usually enjoyed local production runs, often for a month or longer. The popularity of stage burlesque in general and operatic burlesque in particular seems to have stemmed from the many ways in which it entertained a diverse group, and the manner in which it fed and fed on the circus-like or carnivalesque atmosphere of public Victorian London.&lt;ref name=marvin/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[W. S. Gilbert]] wrote five opera burlesques early in his career, beginning with ''[[Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack]]'' (1866), the most successful of which was ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' (1868).&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1870s, [[Lydia Thompson]]'s burlesque troupe, with [[Willie Edouin]], became famous for their burlesques, by such authors as [[H. B. Farnie]] and [[Robert Reece]], both in Britain and the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, W. J., rev. J. Gilliland. "Thompson, Lydia (1838–1908)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2008 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shakespeare scholar [[Stanley Wells]] notes that although parodies of Shakespeare had appeared even in Shakespeare's lifetime, the heyday of Shakespearean burlesque was the Victorian era.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Stanley. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2867735 "Shakespearian Burlesques",] ''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol. 16, No. 1 (Winter, 1965), pp. 49–61, Folger Shakespeare Library in association with George Washington University, accessed 2 February 2011  {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells observes that the typical Victorian Shakespeare burlesque "takes a Shakespeare play as its point of departure and creates from it a mainly comic entertainment, often in ways that bear no relation to the original play."&lt;ref name=Wells55&gt;Wells, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;  Wells gives, as an example of the puns in the texts, the following: Macbeth and Banquo make their first entrance under an umbrella.  The witches greet them with "Hail! hail! hail!": Macbeth asks Banquo, "What mean these salutations, noble thane?" and is told "These showers of 'Hail' anticipate your 'reign'".&lt;ref name=Wells55/&gt;  Musically, Shakespearean burlesques were as varied as the others of the genre.  An 1859 burlesque of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' contained 23 musical numbers, some from opera, such as the serenade from ''[[Don Pasquale]]'', and some from traditional airs and popular songs of the day including "[[Buffalo Gals]]", and "Nix my Dolly".&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs,  Henry E., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2869557 "The Bard Debunked",] ''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol. 31, No. 2 (Summer, 1980), pp. 294–96, Folger Shakespeare Library in association with George Washington University, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Faustupto.jpg|right|thumb|Sheet music from ''[[Faust up to Date]]'']]
The dialogue for burlesques was generally written in rhyming couplets, or, less often, in other verse forms, such as blank verse; it was notable for its bad [[pun]]s.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;  For example, in ''[[Faust up to Date]]'' (1888), a couplet reads:
:Mephistopheles: "Along the Riviera dudes her praises sing."
:Walerlie: "Oh, did you Riviera such a thing?"&lt;ref&gt;Lubbock, Mark.  [http://www.theatrehistory.com/british/lightopera001.html "History of British musical theatre",] ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'', New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962, pp. 467–68&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Grove'', although "an almost indispensable element of burlesque was the display of attractive women dressed in tights, often in [[Breeches role|travesty roles]] ... the plays themselves did not normally tend to indecency."&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;  Some contemporary critics took a sterner view; in an 1885 article, the critic Thomas Heyward praised Planché ("fanciful and elegant") and Gilbert ("witty, never vulgar"), but wrote of the genre as a whole, "the flashy, 'leggy', burlesque, with its 'slangy' songs, loutish 'breakdowns', vulgar jests, paltry puns and witless grimacing at all that is graceful and poetic is simply odious. … Burlesque, insensate, spiritless and undiscriminating, demoralizes both the audience and the players. It debases the public taste."&lt;ref&gt;Heyward, Thomas, "Burlesque: Its Uses and Abuses", ''Tinsley's Magazine'', November 1885,  p. 477&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert expressed his own views on the worth of burlesque:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The question whether burlesque has a claim to rank as art is, I think, one of degree. Bad burlesque is as far removed from true art as is a bad picture. But burlesque in its higher development calls for high intellectual power on the part of its professors. [[Aristophanes]], [[Rabelais]], [[George Cruikshank|Geo Cruikshank]], the authors of the ''[[Rejected Addresses]]'', [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], Planché were all in their respective lines professors of true burlesque.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, W. S., Letter to Blanche Reives, ''quoted'' in "Modern Burlesque", ''The Orchestra'', November 1880, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his 1859 [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]] burlesque ''Hi-A-Wa-Tha'', the American playwright Charles Walcot encapsulated the character of burlesque in the epilogue, addressed to the audience by [[Mrs. John Wood]] as Minnehaha:
:Ye who love extravaganza,
:Love to laugh at all things funny,
:Love the bold anachronism.
:And the work of paste and scissors,
:And "the unities" destruction,
:Nigger airs, old glees, and catches,
:Interspersed with gems of Op'ra,
:Jokes and puns, good, bad, and so-so, –
:Come and see this mutilation,
:This disgraceful Hiawatha, Mongrel, doggerel Hiawatha!&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Hewitt, Barnard. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3204686  "Mrs. John Wood and the Lost Art of Burlesque Acting",] ''Educational Theatre Journal'', Vol. 13, No. 2 (May, 1961), pp. 82–85, Johns Hopkins University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, ten years later, Gilbert gave an English viewpoint on burlesque, in his epilogue to ''[[The Pretty Druidess]]'':
:So for burlesque I plead. Forgive our rhymes;
:Forgive the jokes you've heard five thousand times;
:Forgive each breakdown, cellar-flap, and clog,&lt;ref&gt;Three types of dance popular in burlesque&lt;/ref&gt;
:Our low-bred songs – our slangy dialogue;
:And, above all – oh, ye with double barrel –
:Forgive the scantiness of our apparel! &lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender reversal and female sexuality==
[[File:The_High_Rollers_Extravaganza_Co._-_Bend_Her_-_c.1900.jpg|thumb|300px|American burlesque on ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben Hur]]'', c. 1900.]]
Actresses in burlesque would often play [[breeches role]]s, which were male roles played by women; likewise, men eventually began to play older female roles.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall, Edith. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30222456 "Classical Mythology in the Victorian Popular Culture"], ''International Journal of the Classic Tradition'', 1999, vol. 5, issue 3, pp. 336–366, accessed 4 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  These reversals allowed viewers to distance themselves from the morality of the play, focusing more on joy and entertainment than catharsis, a definitive shift away from neoclassical ideas.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt;

The depiction of female sexuality in Victorian burlesque was an example of the connection between women as performers and women as sexual objects in Victorian culture.&lt;ref name="Buszek"&gt;Buszek, Maria-Elena.  [http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=394dd17c-6070-4982-a2c4-2e5723826ac7%40sessionmgr104&amp;vid=5&amp;hid=115 "Representing 'Awarishness': Burlesque, Feminist Transgression, and the 19th-Century Pin-up"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The Drama Review'', 1999, vol. 43, issue 4, pp. 141–162, accessed 4 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the history of theatre the participation of women on stage has been questioned.  Victorian culture viewed paid female performance as being closely associated with prostitution, “a profession in which most women in the theatre dabbled, if not took on as a primary source of income.”&lt;ref name=Buszek /&gt;

==Gaiety Theatre==
[[Image:Florence St. John.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Florence St. John]] in ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'']]
Burlesque became the specialty of London's [[Royal Strand Theatre]] and [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] from the 1860s to the early 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Sherson, Erroll, "Lost London Playhouses", ''The Stage'', 28 June 1923, p. 21, one of a series of articles later published in a 1925 book of same name.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s and 1870s, burlesques were often one-act pieces running less than an hour and using [[pastiche]]s and parodies of popular songs, opera [[aria]]s and other music that the audience would readily recognize. [[Nellie Farren]] starred as the Gaiety Theatre's "principal boy" from 1868, and [[John D'Auban]] choreographed the burlesques there from 1868 to 1891.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps". ''The Times'', 17 April 1922, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tm&gt;Biographical file for John D'Auban, list of productions and theatres, [[The Theatre Museum]], London (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward O'Connor Terry]] joined the theatre in 1876. Early Gaiety burlesques included ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' (1868, by Gilbert), ''The Bohemian G-yurl and the Unapproachable Pole'' (1877), ''Blue Beard'' (1882), ''Ariel'' (1883, by [[F. C. Burnand]]) and ''[[Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed]]'' (1883).

Beginning in the 1880s, when comedian-writer [[Fred Leslie]] joined the Gaiety, composers like [[Meyer Lutz]] and [[Osmond Carr]] contributed original music to the burlesques, which were extended to a full-length two- or three-act format.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 February 1914, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; These later Gaiety burlesques starred Farren and Leslie.  They often included Leslie's [[libretti]], written under his pseudonym, "A. C. Torr",&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Maurice. 'The spark that lit the bonfire', in ''Gilbert and Sullivan News'' (London) Spring 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and were usually given an original score by Lutz: ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' (1885), ''[[Monte Cristo Jr.]]'' (1886), ''Pretty Esmeralda'' (1887), ''[[Frankenstein, or The Vampire's Victim]]'' (1887),&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, pp. 14 and 55&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mazeppa'' and ''[[Faust up to Date]]'' (1888).  ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue|Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]'' (1889) made fun of the play ''[[Ruy Blas]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt;  The title was a pun, and the worse the pun, the more Victorian audiences were amused.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Donald J., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3825187 "The Uses of Victorian Laughter",] ''Victorian Studies'', Vol. 10, No. 2 (December 1966), pp. 145–76,  Indiana University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last Gaiety burlesques were ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'' (1890),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/August/prog1detail1.htm |title=Programme for ''Carmen up to Data'' |access-date=10 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210092757/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/August/prog1detail1.htm |archive-date=10 December 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, pp. 254–55&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cinder Ellen up too Late]]'' (1891), and ''Don Juan'' (1892, with lyrics by [[Adrian Ross]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cuttings&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm Arthur Lloyd Music Hall site (on Gaiety) ''Cuttings''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104132022/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm |date=4 January 2008 }} accessed 01 Mar 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1890s, Farren retired, Leslie died, and musical burlesque went out of fashion in London, as the focus of the Gaiety and other burlesque theatres changed to the new genre of [[Edwardian musical comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, Kurt. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/38669 "Edwardes, George Joseph (1855–1915)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, [[Seymour Hicks]] declared that burlesque "is dead as a doornail and will never be revived." From her retirement, Nellie Farren endorsed this judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''water balloon''' or '''water bomb''' is a [[latex]] rubber [[balloon]] filled with [[water]]. Water balloons are used in a summer pastime of cooling off through water balloon wars. Water balloons are also popular for celebrations, including celebrating [[Holi]] and [[Carnival]] in [[India]], [[Nepal]], and several other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepalitimes.com.np/issue/2005/03/25/Arts/9 Nepali Times] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123065021/http://www.nepalitimes.com.np/issue/2005/03/25/Arts/9 |date=January 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

Water balloons are common in sizes from {{cvt|1+1/2|and|4|in|-1|order=flip|disp=or}} though larger sizes are available.  Typically water balloons are sold in quantity and often include a filling nozzle in the packaging.  Many of the low cost brands use small water balloons and generic nozzles which both tend to be difficult to use.

[[File:Octohedral paper water bomb.jpg|thumb|An octahedral paper water bomb.]]
Another form of water bomb is a sheet of paper [[origami|folded]] to form a container capable of holding water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newmedia.purchase.edu/~Jeanine/origami/oribomb.htm] Origami&lt;/ref&gt;  These are then filled and used in a similar way to latex versions.

[[Gas]] balloons ([[air]] or [[helium]] types) may be used as water balloons, but are not typically preferred because the balloon wall thickness is different. A water balloon is designed to be filled up to the approximate size of a [[baseball]] in a [[pear]] shape (so as to be thrown more easily), whereas some gas balloons, when filled with water, may reach the size of a [[basketball]]; this is disadvantageous because those balloons are harder to handle, usually requiring two hands. Mainly for safety reasons, water balloon walls are designed to be thick enough to be held without bursting yet thin enough to burst upon impact.

In a similar process to gas balloons, water balloons may be molded into various shapes at manufacturing.  One process involves a patented [[mandrel]] for making [[elastomeric]] articles.&lt;ref&gt;US Patent 4943225&lt;/ref&gt;

==Filling and tying devices==
[[File:Sea of water balloons by Slaunger 2009-06-26.JPG|thumb|A variety of water balloons placed in water to prevent popping.]]

Water balloons are typically filled at an indoor faucet, an outside tap, or at the end of a garden hose. Multiple types of filling nozzles are available on the consumer market and come in threaded ({{cvt|3/4|in|cm|disp=sqbr}} standard in the U.S.) and non-threaded types. Non-threaded nozzles are called filling funnels and may be difficult to use. Some brands of nozzles are called loader instead of nozzle, but no differentiation exists between other types of nozzles. Nozzles may include a valve feature for turning the water source on or off as needed.

Homemade water balloon filling stations may incorporate water balloon nozzles or valves that are on the market or use common plumbing fixtures. These stations may have one or more nozzles or valves. Portable and fixed station designs each have distinct pros and cons depending on the location of use, number of system users, and the quantity of filled water balloons needed. Multi-nozzle stations not only enable more water balloons to be filled for adults planning upcoming youth events or for preventing boredom in children upset with how challenging it may be to fill a balloon at a hose spigot, but greatly enhance group social interactions which is very important in toys for children and adult volunteers that work with children.

Multiple toy companies have created balloon tying and filling devices, enabling the user to easily fill and tie water balloons.

== Environmental impact ==

Water balloons, like air balloons, are generally made from latex, which naturally decomposes.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20080210203053/http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/Media/Balloon%20Releases.pdf?MEDIA_ID=183334&amp;FILENAME=Balloon%20Releases.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; While there still could be some environmental impact if burst water balloons are left behind in the wild where animals might ingest them, that impact would be low. However, some air balloons are made from [[mylar]], which does not decompose (or only extremely slowly). If mylar balloons are used as water bombs, then [[litter]]ing or leaving behind mylar balloons will have a much bigger environmental impact. The use of mylar balloons might be less problematic in closed controlled (indoor) environments where the material is subsequently collected and recycled, which is possible with mylar. (Latex balloons are compostable.)

==Yo-yo balloon==

'''Yo-yo balloons''', also known as '''Yo-yo Tsuris''', are a common type of water balloon found at [[matsuri]] festivals in [[Japan]]. Typically small, round, and colourful, the balloons are filled to a diameter of about {{cvt|75|mm|in|0}} with air and roughly {{cvt|45|mL|floz}} of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.larrys.org/pages/yoyo-balloon-assembly-instructions|title=YoYo Balloon Assembly Instructions|work=Larry's Balloons|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The balloon is clipped or tied closed and hung from an elastic string with a finger loop tied at the end. This gives them enough weight and bounce to function as a [[yo-yo]], earning them their name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovernikkei.org/nikkeialbum/en/node/4236 Japanese Yo-Yos]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kariya-porritt.com/HomePage1998/PhotoAlbum98/AlbumPage10/AlbumPage10.htm|title=Family Photo Album -- Page Ten|work=kariya-porritt.com|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The balloons are often won in a game (''Yo-yo Tsuri'' or just ''yo-yo''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/JICC/japan-now/EJN_vol4_no8.htm Japan Now, Vol. 4, No. 8 (June 19, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;) where they are set floating in a tub of water. Players "fish" for the balloons with a hook  at the end of a twisted paper string.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.webshots.com/photo/1351475331070891345mUCvOi|title=Webshots - Serval in the Savannah, Kenya|author=Webshots|work=webshots.com|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the wet paper line breaks easily, the game is often likened to [[goldfish scooping]] in terms of difficulty.

The Wii video game ''[[Ennichi no Tatsujin]]'' includes a virtual Yo-yo Tsuri game.

[[Guinness World Records]] maintains a record category for largest water balloon fight. The current holder is the University of Kentucky Christian Student Fellowship, a campus ministry of the [[Christian churches and churches of Christ]].

The '''Whitehall farces''' were a series of five long-running comic stage plays at the [[Whitehall Theatre]] in London, presented by the [[actor-manager]] [[Brian Rix]], in the 1950s and 1960s. They were in the [[low comedy]] tradition of British [[farce]], following the [[Aldwych farce]]s, which played at the [[Aldwych Theatre]] between 1924 and 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Nightingale, Benedict. [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/30/theater/theater-england-s-endless-love-affair-with-farce.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm "Theater; England's Endless Love Affair with Farce"], ''The New York Times'', 30 August 1987, 2 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===The farces; critical reception===
The five farces were as follows:

|}

Rix built a company of regular players who appeared in some or all of these shows. They included [[Leo Franklyn]], Larry Noble, Dennis Ramsden and [[Derek Royle]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; and members of Rix's family: his wife, [[Elspet Gray]], his sister, [[Sheila Mercier]] and his brother-in-law, Peter Mercier. Others who appeared in one or more of the Whitehall farces include [[Terry Scott]]&lt;ref&gt;Gaye, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Andrew Sachs]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Rix starred in all five plays, in a range of roles: a "gormless recruit" to the army in ''Reluctant Heroes'';&lt;ref&gt;"Whitehall Theatre", ''The Times'', 13 September 1950, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; a timidly crooked [[bookie]]'s runner in ''Dry Rot'';&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; a street musician recruited as a secret agent in ''Simple Spymen'';&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; four identical brothers in ''One For the Pot'';&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; and a harassed civil servant in ''Chase Me, Comrade''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; From ''Dry Rot'' onwards, Rix and his authors developed a double act for the Rix characters and those played by Leo Franklyn, in which the two performers played off one another rather as [[Ralph Lynn]] and [[Tom Walls]] had done in the Aldwych farces of the previous generation.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 58, 77 and 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the five plays had long runs and packed houses, most London critics were snobbishly dismissive of them. Looking back in 1980, [[Michael Coveney]] wrote of the Whitehall farces, "A tradition of critical snobbery has grown up around these plays, partly because they were so blatantly popular but chiefly because of our conviction that farce, unless written by a Frenchman, is an inferior theatrical species. Once the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] has done its duty by [[J.B. Priestley|Priestley]] and [[Terence Rattigan|Rattigan]] and others teetering on the brink of theatrical respectability I suggest they employ Mr. Rix … to investigate the ignored riches of English farce between [[Ben Travers|Travers]] and [[Alan Ayckbourn|Ayckbourn]]."&lt;ref&gt;Coveney, Michael. "Simple Spymen", ''[[The Financial Times]]'', 11 August 1980, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The few London critics of the 1950s and 1960s who did not take a lofty view included [[Harold Hobson]], Ronald Bryden, J. W. Lambert and [[Alan Dent]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television broadcasts; later productions===
In addition to the five long-running farces, Rix presented a series of more than eighty one-off televised comedies, some of them farces, for the [[BBC]]. The first was transmitted live from the Whitehall Theatre in January 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Rix, Brian. [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/07/whitehall-farces-tv-theatre-relationship "The Whitehall farces had a major role in the TV-theatre relationship"], ''The Guardian'', 7 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; There were also film versions of ''[[Reluctant Heroes]]'' (1951), ''[[Dry Rot (film)|Dry Rot]]'' (1956), and ''Chase Me, Comrade'', which was renamed ''[[Not Now, Comrade]]'' (1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/reluctant-heroes-107563/cast |title=Reluctant Heroes (1951) - Trailers, Reviews, Synopsis, Showtimes and Cast |publisher=AllMovie |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMDb&gt;{{IMDb title|0155104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/cdc65/dry-rot |title=Dry Rot &amp;#124; Film review and movie reviews |work=Radio Times |date=2013-04-08 |accessdate=2014-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://networkonair.com/features/2013/05/09/not-now-comrade/|title=Networkonair &gt; Features  &gt; Not Now Comrade|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, having been unable to secure the lease of the Whitehall Theatre, Rix took his company on tour in ''Chase Me, Comrade'' and ''Bang, Bang Beirut'' (later retitled ''Stand By Your Bedouin''), by Cooney and Hilton.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Later productions by the Rix company at the [[Garrick Theatre]] and elsewhere included ''Uproar in the House'', by [[Anthony Marriott]] and Alistair Foot (1967); ''Let Sleeping Wives Lie'' by Harold Brooke and Kay Bannerman (1967); ''She's Done It Again'', by [[Michael Pertwee]] (1969); ''Don't Just Lie There, Say Something'' (Pertwee, 1971); and ''A Bit Between the Teeth'' (Pertwee, 1974). According to Leslie Smith in a study of modern British farce, although some of the Rix productions after ''Chase Me, Comrade'' achieved substantial success, none of them had the conspicuously long runs of the five Whitehall farces.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 Rix returned to the Whitehall with Fringe Benefits (Churchill and Cooney)  which ran until 1977 when he retired from the stage.
